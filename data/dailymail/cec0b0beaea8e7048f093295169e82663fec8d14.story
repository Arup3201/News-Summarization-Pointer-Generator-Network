The widow of a Texas teacher shot dead in Libya earlier this month has said she has no hatred for his attackers and that she forgives them.

As Anita Smith prepared for husband Ronnie's funeral in Austin today, she said the couple and their son had moved to Benghazi because they wanted to help the Libyans.

Mr Smith, a chemistry teacher at an international school, was shot dead by unknown attackers as he jogged near their home on December 5.

Forgiveness: Anita Smith says she feels no hatred for the Libyans who shot dead her husband

Grief: Anita Smith with Ronnie and their son. The couple had been together for 16 years before Ronnie was shot

In an open letter to the Libyans, written in Arabic, Mrs Smith wrote: 'I hear people speaking with hate, anger 
and blame over Ronnie's death, but that's not what Ronnie would want.'

'Ronnie would want his death to be an opportunity for us to show one 
another love and forgiveness, because that's what God has shown to us.'

Mrs Smith told CBS the couple, who had been together for 16 years, knew there was a risk involved in being in Libya, but felt safe once there.

'We knew before going into Libya that 
there was risk. We were doing this because we wanted to follow what God 
has for us, and that's to show the Libyan people His love and His 
forgiveness,' she said.

The couple soon settled into life in Benghazi, making friends with their neighbors and learning to ignore the sound of bombing at night. 

'It just was normal life ... It was even a joke within the city among the Libyan people just saying, "Have you gotten used to the bombs?",' she said.

Adventure: Ronnie and Anita Smith on the plane to Libya, where Ronnie worked as a teacher

Mrs Smith had returned to the U.S. with the couple's son just before her husband was killed. He had been due to join them for a family Christmas just a few weeks later.

No one has 
claimed responsibility but the 33-year-old's death came days after an al 
Qaeda chief urged Libyans to attack America as revenge for a U.S. 
special forces operation that snatched a terrorist suspect in Tripoli.

'[Ronnie's] just been daily in my life all 
these years, growing together. And just imagining the rest of life 
without him, doesn't seem real,' Mrs Smith told CBS.

But the Christian has managed to find forgiveness for her husband's killers - who have not yet been caught - telling them in her open letter: 'Jesus taught us to "Love our enemies" - not to kill them or seek revenge.'

Mrs Smith is planning to return to Benghazi to visit the couple's friends and neighbors, who have rallied round and sent messages of support since the shooting.

Before the couple left for Libya, her husband had made a video for 
the Austin Stone Community Church.

In it, he said he was worried about adapting to Libyan life but felt a desire to 
spread a spiritual message. The teacher said: 'If there's any single 
person in the entire universe that you can take a chance on, it's God.'

Education: Ronnie Smith worked at Benghazi International School, where students and teachers paid tribute to him

The video clip, shown by CBS,
 shows Ronnie and his wife Anita boarding the plane to begin their new 
life. At one point, the teacher leans over in his seat to plant a kiss 
on his wife's cheek.

Although
 he was aware of the dangers, particularly as a U.S. citizen, Mr Smith 
drew strength from his faith and the difference that he could make in 
his students' lives.

He said: 'No matter what happens, I'm good. That gives me peace, and I'm OK with that.'

The
 chemistry teacher also served as a deacon at the Austin Stone Community
 Church which is described on its website as a New Testament Church.

Mr
 Smith's commitment to his life in Benghazi and the people he met, was 
reflected in the hundreds of messages posted on social media in the wake
 of his death. The chemistry teacher described himself as 'Libya's best 
friend' on his Twitter account.

Mr
 Smith's students tweeted emotional tributes to their chemistry teacher 
with the tag #ThankYouSmith. Sara wrote: '#ThankYouSmith for being a great teacher and an amazing friend.'

@umyeahidek
 posted: '#ThankYouSmith for risking your life every single day to help 
reach our full potential in life. I am sorry you had to go this way.'

Devoted: Ronnie Smith tweeted this picture on November 15 of his wedding day with wife Anita with the message: '16 years with my besty'

The
 Libyan Youth movement wrote: 'Ronnie was living and teaching in 
#Benghazi on his own accord, he told friends "If I were to be killed, I 
will die for Education." #libya

Adel al Mansouri, 
director of International School Benghazi, said: 'He was doing his morning exercise when gunmen just shot him. I don't 
know why. He was so sweet with everyone.'

The director added: 'He 
loved being in Benghazi and he loved Libya and the kindness of its 
people.' 

The
 teacher was jogging in an area close to the U.S. Consulate when he was killed.

The U.S. ambassador to Libya 
Christopher
 Stevens and three other Americans - Sean Smith, Tyron Woods 
and Glen Doherty - were killed on September 11, 2012 
when Islamist militants assaulted the consulate in Benghazi.

Benghazi has become a flashpoint for 
violence in Libya with the city at the heart of the 2011 revolution 
against leader Muammar Gaddafi.

Libyan
 special forces have been battling
 militants from Ansar al-Sharia, the group that U.S. officials blame for
 attacking the U.S. consulate in the eastern city in September 
2012.

Two
 years after a NATO-backed uprising ousted veteran leader Gaddafi, 
Libya's armed forces are struggling to contain militias, former fighters
 and Islamist militants who control parts of the vast oil-producing 
country.

Faith: Ronnie Smith went to Libya to help

My
 husband and best friend Ronnie Smith loved the Libyan people. For more 
than a year, Ronnie served as a chemistry teacher in a school in 
Benghazi, and he would gladly have given more years to Libya if unknown 
gunmen had not cut his life short on December 5, 2013.

Ronnie
 and I came to Libya because we saw the suffering of the Libyan people, 
but we also saw your hope, and we wanted to partner with you to build a 
better future. Libya was very different from what we had experienced 
before, but we were excited to learn about Libyan culture. Ronnie grew 
to love you and your way of life, as did I. Ronnie really was "Libya’s 
best friend".

Friends 
and family from home were concerned about our safety, as were some of 
you. We talked about this more times than I can count. But we stayed 
because we believed the Libyan people were worth the risk. Even knowing 
what I know now, I have no doubt that we would both make the same 
decision all over again.

Ronnie
 loved you all so much, especially his students. He loved to joke with 
you, tell stories about you, help you with your lives and challenge you 
to be all that you could be. He did his best to live out his faith 
humbly and respectfully within a community of people with a different 
faith.

To his attackers: I love you and I forgive you.

How
 could I not? For Jesus taught us to “Love our enemies” -- not to kill 
them or seek revenge. Jesus sacrificed His life out of love for the very
 people who killed him, as well as for us today. His death and 
resurrection opened the door for us to walk on the straight path to God 
in peace and forgiveness. Because of what Jesus did, Ronnie is with 
Jesus in paradise now. Jesus did not come only to take us to paradise 
when we die, but also to bring peace and healing on this earth. Ronnie 
loved you because God loves you. Ronnie loved you because God loved him - not because Ronnie was so great, but because God is so great.

To
 the Libyan people: I always expected that God would give us a heart to 
love you, but I never expected you to love us so much. We came to bless 
you, but you have blessed us much more. Thank you. Thank you for your 
support and love for Ronnie and our son Hosea and me. Since Ronnie’s 
death my love for you has increased in ways that I never imagined. I 
feel closer to you now than ever before.

I
 hear people speaking with hate, anger and blame over Ronnie’s death, 
but that's not what Ronnie would want. Ronnie would want his death to be
 an opportunity for us to show one another love and forgiveness, because
 that’s what God has shown us.

I
 want all of you - all of the people of Libya - to know I am praying 
for the peace and prosperity of Libya. May Ronnie's blood, shed on 
Libyan soil, encourage peace and reconciliation between the Libyan 
people and God.
