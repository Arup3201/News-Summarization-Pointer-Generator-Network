Talented: Former head boy and star pupil Adam Dixon, 18, died after taking MDMA with friends at university at the beginning of a new term

Youngsters who take ecstasy are playing Russian roulette with their lives, a coroner has warned.

West Yorkshire coroner David Hinchliff urged young people to be careful after former head boy Adam Dixon died in his halls at Leeds Metropolitan University from taking the drug.

The keen musician bought the MDMA and split it between himself and two friends when they gathered before term began in January this year, Leeds Coroner’s Court was told.

They listened to music and danced, heading to bed at 1am.

At around 4.30am, the two friends woke up and realised Adam, 18, was not well.

They called an ambulance and the building’s security guard, who performed CPR on Adam, of Halifax, West Yorkshire, until paramedics arrived. But he was pronounced dead at 5.42am.

Dr Richard Shepherd, who conducted the post-mortem examination, said the drug had caused Adam’s heart to beat irregularly, which would have led to his death.

Adam’s parents David and Tracey told the inquest their son was ‘clever, articulate, loving and thoughtful’.

They added: ‘We would urge anyone who is even contemplating trying this or any drug to avoid it at all costs.’

Mr Dixon said Adam had been head boy at Hipperholme and Lightcliffe High School, a position he ‘really enjoyed’.

He played rugby union for the school team and another club, ran a club coaching children rugby and helped his mother at her childcare business.

Adam, who played guitar and drums and 
was lead vocalist in a band, was also involved in fundraising for the 
Meningitis Trust after losing a school friend to the illness.

Recording a cause of death as a 
consequence of a non-dependent abuse of drugs, Mr Hinchliff said: ‘You 
could take ecstasy 100 times and have no effect, yet one time you could 
be struck. It’s like playing Russian roulette.

‘I hope this is a warning to people that this is a very dangerous practice.’
