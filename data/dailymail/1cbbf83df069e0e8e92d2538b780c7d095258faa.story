Furious M&S customers threatened to boycott the store last night for allowing Muslim checkout staff to refuse to serve customers who want to pay for alcohol or pork.

Managers at a London store told the workers they could ask any shoppers trying to buy the items to wait until a different till was available, it emerged yesterday.

One shopper said: 'I had one bottle of champagne, and the lady, who was wearing a headscarf, was very apologetic but said she could not serve me. She told me to wait until another member of staff was available.

Policy: Marks & Spencer has told Muslim staff they can refuse to serve shoppers buying alcohol or pork

Wait: Instead, shoppers are being asked to wait to pay for goods like alcohol at a different till (file picture)

'I was taken aback. I've never come across that before.'

Last night, Marks & Spencer said the advice had been given in error and was not consistent with its national policy.

But
 customers bombarded the store's Facebook page to complain, while 
another site was set up calling on shoppers to boycott M&S.

More than 1,500 others put posts on MailOnline.

Customer
 Matt Syson wrote: 'If you have Christian workers who wish to refuse 
the sale of ladies' garments to male homosexuals or men's trousers to 
lesbians, I do hope you will stand by those workers' religious or 
personal beliefs.

'My family
 and I shall no longer purchase any goods from your company due to the 
implementation of this “one rule system” that creates further division 
and hatred within our communities.' 

Decision: The chain said the policy of tolerance acknowledges the beliefs of other religious workers

Angela Phillips posted: 'If M&S go ahead with this they are going to lose so many loyal customers.

'If they do not want to serve people with pork or alcohol they shouldn't work in the food hall. Simple!'

Heather
 Playdon posted on the store's Facebook page: 'I shan't be shopping in 
M&S any more. The quintessentially British retailer bows down to 
Muslim beliefs. And in turn alienates the majority of Christian and 
non-religious customers. Outrageous.'

Contrast: However, Sainsbury's has issued guidelines stating that all staff members must be treated 'fairly'

'No sense': Meanwhile, Tesco said it 'would make no sense' to employ staff who refused to touch specific items

Sainsbury's
 guidelines state there is no reason why staff who do not drink alcohol 
or eat pork for religious reasons cannot handle them. Tesco said it made
 no sense to put staff on a till if they refused to touch certain items 
for religious reasons.

Asda 
said it would not deploy any Muslims on tills who objected to handling 
alcohol, while Morrisons, which is based in Bradford where there is a 
large Muslim community, said it would 'respect anyone's wishes not to 
handle products for religious or cultural reasons'.

Dr
 Michael Nazir-Ali, the former Bishop of Rochester, said: 'If 
supermarkets do  not put up a notice saying “This desk does not handle 
alcoholic beverages”, shoppers could be humiliated when they get to the 
checkout.'

An M&S 
spokesman said: 'Customer service is our priority. Where we have an 
employee whose religious beliefs restrict food or drink they can handle,
 we work closely with our member  of staff to place them in a suitable 
role, such as in our clothing department or bakery.

'We regret that in the case highlighted today we were not following our own policy.

'As a secular business  we have an inclusive policy that welcomes all religious beliefs.

'This
 policy has been in place for many years, and when followed correctly,  
we do not believe that it should compromise our ability to offer the 
highest level of customer service. We apologise that this policy  was 
not followed in the case reported.'
