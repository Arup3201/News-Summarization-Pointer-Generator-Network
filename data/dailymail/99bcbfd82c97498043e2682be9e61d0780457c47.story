International drug baron Alan Sibley, aged 56, was jailed after being tracked down to a Mexican hideaway following an escape from a UK prison

An international drugs baron was jailed today despite fleeing to Mexico after escaping from prison in the UK.

Alan Sibley, 56, who lived in Lightwater, Surrey before going on the run, was imprisoned for 23 years after a complex operation to nail him spanned three continents and more than 10 years.

Investigators found hundreds of thousands of pounds of cash and several kilograms of cocaine at his home.

Some of the cocaine discovered had been cut with a sugar product.

A spokesman from Surrey Police said Sibley’s illegal hauls, worth up to £1million pounds that was destined for the UK’s streets was hidden inside tables, sinks and furniture as it made its way across oceans.

Sibley, was found guilty of conspiring to import cocaine into Britain following his extradition from Mexico.

He was sentenced at Guildford Crown Court following a two week trial after he denied conspiring to import class A drugs but admitted escaping lawful custody.

Sibley had been charged with conspiracy to import class A drugs and escaping from lawful custody in 2005 following a lengthy and extensive Surrey Police investigation.

Around £1million worth of drugs were seized in the raid on Mr Sibley's home. He later escaped from jail and fled to Mexico

A spokesman said that Sibley was originally arrested by officers at an address in Lightwater in April 2001 as part of a covert Surrey Police investigation.

A search of Sibley’s home address at the time led to officers recovering 2.61 kilograms of cocaine and several metal presses, each containing one kilogram blocks of cocaine, which had been mixed with a pharmaceutical sugar product and just over £340,000 pounds in cash.

Sibley was later arrested and on November 26 2001 he was sentenced to 10 years in prison at Guildford Crown Court, having admitted possession of a class A drug with intent to supply, part way through the trial.

However Sibley absconded from prison four years later - in April 2005 - and subsequently fled from the UK and eventually set up residence in Mexico.

An arrest warrant was later issued for Sibley for escaping from lawful custody and he was listed as one of Surrey Police’s Most Wanted offenders.

The spokesman said that in 2006 Surrey Police was notified that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in Cincinnati, Ohio, had intercepted a drugs consignment destined for the UK, where cocaine had been hidden inside a table.

The Surrey Police Serious and Organised Crime Unit was subsequently able to identify a further 17 consignments which had been shipped to the UK over a three year period where drugs had been hidden in baths, sinks and metal tables.

The police spokesman said that further inquiries and a forensic examination of the drugs packages hidden in the consignments led to Surrey Police finding evidence which directly implicated Sibley in the drug importation operation.

Police then worked closely with the US and Mexican authorities and HM Revenue and Customs to trace where the consignments originated.

In November 2012 Sibley was arrested by local authorities in Mexico and in February this year officers from Surrey Police’s Extradition Team flew to Mexico City to bring him back to the UK.

Surrey officers arrived back at Heathrow Airport with Sibley on February 28 this year.

Detective Inspector Ben Lee said: 'I welcome today’s lengthy custodial sentence for Sibley which marks the culmination of an extensive and complex investigation into an international drug smuggling operation.

'Sibley’s return to the UK was only possible thanks to years of hard work from a number of agencies and co-operation from the Mexican authorities; to whom we are extremely grateful.

'After escaping from the UK in 2005 Sibley, working with a number of associates, quickly established a sophisticated and highly organised operation to import dangerous drugs into the UK.'

Sibley was sentenced to 22 years for the drugs offense and a further 12 months for the prison escape.
