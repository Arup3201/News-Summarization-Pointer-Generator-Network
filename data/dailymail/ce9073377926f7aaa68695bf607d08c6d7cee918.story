A recently-imposed ban restricting large cruise ships from passing through Italy’s historic city of Venice has been lifted.

The city’s regional court of appeal overturned the regulations, which were only implemented in November, and which prevented all ships over 96,000 gross tons from sailing along the Guidecca Canal to the city’s main cruise terminal.

It also limited the number of ships over 40,000 gross tonnes from sailing along the route to just five a day.

No more: Large cruise ships will longer be able to sail in Saint Mark's basin and the Giudecca Canal

The restrictions were imposed after stars including Michael Douglas and Cate Blanchett added their signatures to a petition calling for an end to the sight of liners dwarfing buildings such as St Mark’s Basilica. 

However, while the move paves the way for the towering vessels, dubbed ‘skyscrapers of the sea’, to once again sail through Venice, no changes will be seen in the near future.

The Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), which represents 53 major cruise lines, said itineraries for 2015 had already been finalised and larger ships would continue to steer clear of Venice for the rest of the year.

Among those above the 96,000 GT limit are Princess Cruises’ Regal Princess and Emerald Princess, Celebrity Cruises’ Equinox and Silhouette as well as some Costa Cruises and MSC vessels.

Plea: Hollywood stars Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Cate Blanchett signed a petition in June

Instead, the cruise lines have agreed to wait for an alternative route to Venice’s cruise terminal  to be drawn up and investigated.

An environmental impact assessment on its construction is expected in March while the project would require an estimated 18 months for completion.

‘We acknowledge and respect the verdict of Veneto’s Regional Administrative Court,’ said CLIA, in a statement.

Stunning views: There has been a long-standing concern the ships might cause damage and omit smog

‘CLIA and its member lines have chosen to voluntarily refrain from bringing ships above 96,000 tons to Venice until a new navigational route becomes operational.

‘We are looking forward to welcoming a final decision by the Italian government on the alternative route for big ships in Venice.’

The restriction had been put in place to prevent damage to the fragile buildings and environment in Venice.

Environmental groups have been protesting against the large ships for a number of years citing the destruction and potential for flooding of the historic landmarks.

However, the tribunal was urged by numerous tourism groups and the Venice Passenger Terminal (VTP) to overturn the ban, with ports and cruise industry employees arguing that the ships bring in millions of euros to the Venice economy. 

The huge cruise ships have been criticised for dwarfing Venice's Byzantine architecture

The VTP had predicted losses of just under 300,000 passengers a year as a result of the ban.

Meanwhile, UNESCO's president of the Italian National Commission was reportedly appalled by the decision, claiming that the public interest should take precedent over cruise ships.

Last year, the number of cruise ships sailing through Venice was capped at 708, compared to 809 in 2012.

The huge liners dubbed the 'skyscrapers of the sea' have been able to pass within 1,000ft of the iconic St. Mark's Square, granting a stunning view to those aboard but dwarfing Venice's Byzantine architecture.

The decision comes after Michael Douglas and Cate Blanchett added their signatures to a petition calling for an end to the sight of liners dwarfing buildings such as St Mark’s Basilica.

Other big-screen figures also on the list of endorsees included Rob Lowe, Diane Lane, Sir Michael Caine, Edward Norton, Susan Sarandon and Isabella Rossellini.

Julie Christie, whose most iconic film – the 1973 supernatural thriller Don’t Look Now – was set in Venice, also signed the petition.

The open letter, penned by the celebrities and addressed to the Italian Prime Minister, read: 'Having prevailed against flood, pestilence, and war for more than thirteen centuries, Venice, the Queen of the Adriatic, and unparalleled UNESCO Word Heritage site, now, in a moment of relative tranquility, finds herself mortally threatened by the daily transit of gargantuan ocean liners, indifferent to the probable risk of catastrophe.

'Since the flood of 1966, Italy and countless Italian and international supporters have contributed to the defence of the world's most fragile city, eternally subject to destruction.

'The absolute lack of respect presented by the outlandish spectacle of the ongoing obstruction and potentially destruction, of one of humanity’s pre-eminent monuments is not only dumbfounding but both morally and culturally unacceptable.

'We urgently request an immediate and irrevocable halt to the traffic of the Big Ships in front of San Marco and along the Giudecca Canal putting an end to this senseless devastation.'
