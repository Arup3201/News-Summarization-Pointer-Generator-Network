She was alarmed after seeing some of the risque selfies her students were posting online.

So, sixth-grade teacher Melissa Bour decided to teach the 11- and 12-year-olds a lesson - by showing them how quickly a photo or comment can go viral on the internet.

The science and math teacher at Emerson Elementary School in Tulsa, Oklahoma, wrote a letter about her students' sharing habits, before uploading an image of the document to Facebook.

She then asked her friends to share the  letter, written in caps and addressed to 'Dear Facebook', online. Within hours, it had gone viral, appearing in nearly every state, as well as other countries.

A lesson learned: Sixth-grade teacher, Melissa Bour, decided to teach her students a lesson about the dangers of posting risque photos online by writing this letter (pictured) and posting an image of it online

And although Miss Bour later deleted the original post, copies of it remain online - proving another lesson for students that just because you delete an image, it is not totally erased from the internet.

In the letter, the teacher wrote: 'Dear Facebook, I am a 6th grade teacher in Oklahoma. My 12 year old students think it is 'no big deal' that they are posting pictures of themselves in bras or with their middle fingers in the air.

'Please help me out by sharing this image and commenting with where you live to show these young students how quickly their images can get around. Thanks! Miss Bour.' 

Speaking to Fox 23, Miss Bour said she decided to write the letter and share it online in early December after receiving a Facebook friend request from one of her sixth-grade students.

Although she did not accept the request, she was able to browse the student's friend list and noticed that a high number of her pupils were posting selfies to the social-networking site.

In many of these, the students were donning skimpy clothing or swearing at the camera, she said.

After failing to verbally convince her class to stop posting such images, she took to Facebook to get her point across and prevent her students from enduring undesirable consequences in later life.

'I had students respond with "It’s no big deal" and "nobody really cares", and I care. I care very much about their reputations,' Miss Bour said.

'My generation was the one that kind of made Facebook big, and we have a tendency to overshare. These students are just falling into that. 

'You have to remind them that just because everyone else is sharing doesn’t mean you have to.'

She added that Tulsa Public Schools curriculum allowed her to make the post because the district supports teaching youngsters how to be a good digital citizen, CNN reported.

Both students and parents alike have reacted positively to Miss Bour's social media lesson - with one student, Peyton Piguet, telling Today: 'I'm not going to put any more photos on my Facebook.'

Xavier Ingram added: ' Say I want to be the president. That might affect me becoming president.'
