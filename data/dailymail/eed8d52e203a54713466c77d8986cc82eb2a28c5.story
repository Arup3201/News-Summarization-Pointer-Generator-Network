In the aftermath of a fine victory, Hearts left Rangers to ponder an old truth. In football, as in life, you reap what you Sow.

Rebuilt and remoulded in the post-script to relegation and administration, Hearts laid down a marker for the Championship season with a display of composure and menace.

They may have lost their keeper Neil Alexander for a month with a fractured cheekbone sustained in a clash with his own player.

But in defence their central defenders Danny Wilson and Alim Ozturk dominated Kris Boyd and Kenny Miller while, in attack Osman Sow, a 6ft 4in Swedish striker starting his first competitive match in over a year, struck a deserved injury-time winner.

‘Osman has come in and shown his qualities,’ said head coach Robbie Neilson afterwards with marked understatement.

‘He needs more fitness but he has pace, strength, good technique and an eye for goal and I think he’ll scare a lot of defenders this season.’

He certainly frightened the life out of Lee McCulloch and Marius Zaliukas.

Ally McCoist was critical of the defending for both Hearts goals, the first a meat and drink header from skipper Danny Wilson from a corner in 52 minutes.

The home team believed they had claimed a late point when Nicky Law responded to howls of derision over his sponsors’ man of the match award by hooking an equaliser as the board went up for six minutes of added time.

Yet, incredibly, Hearts scored straight from kick-off by exploiting the departure of Rangers right-back Ricky Foster to attack the area where his replacement Darren McGregor should have been.

Sow took a couple of touches and slotted a composed finish low in the net for 2-1.

‘Of course it’s unacceptable,’ said McCoist afterwards. ‘They always say you are at your most vulnerable after you score but, to be honest, I’ve never been on the receiving end of that.

‘To have got back into what was a hard game against a team who will be one of our main rivals for the league this year, it was really disappointing.’

Asked if McGregor should have been quicker taking up position, McCoist opted to spread the blame.

‘If you see Darren, he’s coming across and maybe he’s not had much time to react to it, but we had plenty in our team who could have got back and the whole process of losing that goal was very disappointing.’

For Sow, all of this was remarkable stuff. After joining Crystal Palace last summer he failed to start a single game. Yet his performance and goal here showed signs of real promise.

Laid back so as to be almost horizontal, he was completely unconcerned when Rangers equalised and Ibrox roused itself for an anticipated Rangers winner.

‘I just thought: “This is our three points,” he said. ‘I still believed. The atmosphere was great, but all three points are the same in the end.

‘I’m just happy we got them here, it was good to get a win as early as possible.’

Almost the prototype Craig Levein striker – tall, powerful – Sow didn’t need much persuading to join Hearts.

Rangers supporters, by contrast, were left to ponder if this is the kind of imaginative signing they might make if they had a scouting network.

‘I was a free agent and had some other opportunities to go back to Sweden. But I want to make my career here in the UK,’ said Sow.

‘My last competitive game was maybe a year ago last summer for Syrianska in the Swedish league before I joined Palace. This was my first start in a while.’

The afternoon began with a warm tribute to the late Sandy Jardine as Rangers honoured the man who played over 800 games for the club by renaming the Govan Stand in his honour.

Former team-mates from the club’s European Cup Winners’ Cup triumph of 1972 gathered around the centre circle.

For only the second time since his resignation from the Rangers board in protest at Craig Whyte’s stewardship of the club, John Greig attended a match at Ibrox.

Deserved: Hearts took a 1-0 lead courtesy of Wilson early on in the second half

The gesture was a one-off to honour Jardine albeit he declined the invitation to join the Barcelona Bears on the pitch. After 27 minutes he did make an appearance on the large Ibrox screens to unanimous acclaim.

By then Rangers had wasted chances to take the lead. In 18 minutes David Templeton, one of four former Hearts players in the Rangers starting 11, blew the best one by far.

Lewis MacLeod, one of the brighter players for Rangers, did well to create a shooting chance for Miller.

The former Scotland man’s prodded shot spun up towards the back post after an Alim Ozturk block, falling perfectly for Templeton to head inexplicably over the bar from eight yards. He only had to hit the target.

Provocatively, Hearts coach Neilson had spoken pre-match of training with 10 men against 11, because in his view ‘that’s how it is’ against Rangers at Ibrox.

It looked for a time as if his mind games might become a prescient prediction.

Jordan McGhee was booked early in the game and before 35 minutes were played the dangerous Sow and Kevin McHattie had joined him in the book.

Around the same time, however, the visitors began to settle and play some football.

Sow’s lofted cross from the left in 41 minutes deserved more than a weak downward header from Billy King.

And Hearts had loud calls for a penalty before half-time after some fine passing ended in King crumpling to the deck under a challenge from Law.

Referee Craig Thomson said no penalty. But Hearts were growing in stature.

They began the second half boldly and claimed the lead in 52 minutes with a simple goal.

King’s corner in front of the Bill Struth Main Stand looped into the area, picking out the leaping figure of Hearts skipper Wilson.

The defender’s downward header took a nick off Lee Wallace, but silenced Ibrox as it nestled in the back of the net.

Hearts lived dangerously thereafter, but nowhere near as perilously as McCoist might have liked. Rangers, frankly, created precious little.

Neilson’s side survived a desperate penalty box scramble in 57 minutes when MacLeod’s corner was turned towards goal by Lee McCulloch, then Kris Boyd, before Hearts somehow managed to whack the ball clear through a forest of flailing legs in desperate circumstances.

They weren’t out of the woods yet. In 66 minutes goalkeeper Neil Alexander was stretchered from the field following a clash of heads with Ozturk, his own defender.

Scott Gallacher, the replacement who left Rangers by mutual consent last season, was hastily summoned from the bench. He probably expected a rougher ride than he got.

He was finally beaten in injury time when Law hooked the home team level after Miller knocked down a long, raking, Wallace long ball.

By allowing Sow to run free from the kick off, however, Rangers made a pig’s ear of the situation. The goalscorer’s display here suggested bad pig puns could be a feature of the Championship season.
