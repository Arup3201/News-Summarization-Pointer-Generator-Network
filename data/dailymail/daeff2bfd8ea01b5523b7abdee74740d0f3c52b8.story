Education Minister Christopher Pyne has denied he's trying to save ABC jobs in his home state of South Australia, from his own government and at the expense of the broadcaster's other departments.

Just as his Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull was confirming that the ABC will lose more than $250 million in federal funding (with up to 500 jobs expected to be shed before Christmas) and SBS $25 million, Mr Pyne took the unusual step of launching his own on-line petition on Wednesday calling on the ABC board not to cut production in South Australia.

His office has denied it's a case of double standards, My Pyne attempting to turn the blame onto the ABC board, accusing them of 'political vandalism' if they choose to reduce production costs.

The social media backlash against Christopher Pyne's crusade was immediate

A spokesman for My Pyne told Daily Mail Australia that 'he's not saying that, he's not saying that there should be cuts pushed on elsewhere, it's because of the report (Peter Lewis Report) the (Communication) Minister received, which says there should be no cuts to programming'.

In an interview with ABC Radio 891, Mr Pyne said: 'Obviously the ABC needs to make its contribution to reducing the debt and the deficit that Labor has left us. And Malcolm Turnbull’s done the job for them'.

'He got Peter Lewis to do a report, The Lewis Report, into how to reduce spending at the ABC, which showed that the spending could be reduced without any impact on production, without any impact on programming,' Mr Pyne said.

Christopher Pyne hopes his campaign to save ABC jobs in South Australia will be heard

Reaction to Mr Pyne's petition to save jobs in South Australia has sparked much reaction

'So if ABC management in Ultimo decide to cut jobs and production in Adelaide, it is a deliberate act of political vandalism, because they know, they have the report in front of them, in black and white, showing how to reduce costs without affecting production and programming and that’s what all out listeners need to know. 

'There is no need for there to be a production change here in Adelaide unless in Ultimo in Sydney, they refuse to actually implement the report Malcolm Turnbull had done for them.'

Mr Pyne's petition via Change.org states: 'We, the undersigned, are concerned that ABC in South Australia is the last TV production unit outside of Sydney and Melbourne.

'The Board must reassure South Australians that the local TV production house of the ABC will remain in South Australia. As noted in the ABC’s 2013 annual report, ABC South Australia produces top rating, award-winning shows such as Dream Build which is listed in the 12 most popular Australian made shows.

'Further, ABC South Australia produces television that is often with a regional focus, including but not limited to The Cook and The Chef, Poh’s Kitchen, Dream Build, the Karta orang-utan documentary at Adelaide Zoo, The Beatles 50th anniversary tour documentary, a forthcoming country-based heritage restoration series and more.

'These television series are targeted at individual groups within the community and are crucial to a diverse market. By moving ABC TV elsewhere, it will incur unnecessary costs and remove the efficient and innovative production unit from South Australia.

'We, the undersigned, note that productions such as The Daters has been produced here in South Australia with a limited budget, while using innovative technology which has made it successful enough to be screened on ABC2 and ABC’s iView.

'We, the undersigned, strongly support the ABC staying as a production unit in South Australia and for the ABC to adhere to its charter and continue to tell great stories “that contribute to a sense of national identity… and reflect the cultural diversity of the Australian community”.

Please ensure that the ABC does not close its production house in Adelaide.'

Communications Minister has revealed the cuts to the public broadcasters ABC and SBS saying 'if the ABC or SBS want to make decisions to change or cease programming; that is their choice. The savings are not of a level that require any changes to programming'

Mr Pyne turned the heat up on the ABC Board today saying 'if ABC management in Ultimo decide to cut jobs and production in Adelaide, it is a deliberate act of political vandalism, because they know, they have the report in front of them, in black and white, showing how to reduce costs'

Mr Turnbull has released details, claiming that changes to programming are not required and the savings can be found through 'operational efficiencies'.

His statement read: 'An Efficiency Study was launched in January to identify how the ABC and SBS could find efficiencies in their back office operations, finance, property, IT, administration, corporate and marketing, without impacting on programming'.

'In total, including the 1 per cent down-payment announced in the May budget, the overall savings to the broadcasters is $308 million over five years or 4.4 per cent of taxpayers' investment,' Mr Turnbull stated.

'For the ABC this means it will receive $5.2 billion over five years rather than $5.5 billion, a saving of $254 million or 4.6 per cent.

'The Government is confident that these savings can be achieved without affecting the diverse range and quality of programmes provided by the ABC or SBS. Suggestions that popular programs or services are at risk because of Budget savings are not credible.

'If the ABC or SBS want to make decisions to change or cease programming; that is their choice. The savings are not of a level that require any changes to programming. 

'Programming changes are decisions for the Management and Boards of the organisations, not the Government.'

As for his colleague calling on jobs to be specifically saved in South Australia, Mr Turnbull said 'Christopher is representing his electorate, everybody is entitled to their opinion'.
