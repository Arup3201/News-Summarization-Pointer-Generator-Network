A former greengrocer has amassed one of the world's largest fruit sticker collections.

Christopher Crawcour, 56, keeps 30,000 fruit stickers in nine lever arch files at his Southend-on-Sea, Essex, home.

And like many passionate stamp or coin collectors, he spends hours peering through his beloved collection with no intention to sell it.

Although the unusual hobby isn't so highly regarded by his wife, who says she hates the stickers because Mr Crawcour spends more time with them than her, it could soon be at an end due to a change in EU laws.

Mr Crawcour, who has collected for more than 25 years,  told The Sun: 'To me, this is a hobby like a stamp collection and I do it for love so I would never even consider selling them.'

He told the paper he has the second largest collection in the world, following closely behind a French collector.

His rarest stickers include 1960s labels from the giant banana distributor Chiquita.

But last year's EU ruling means sticky labels on fruit can be replaced by laser 'tattoos' inking identifying information onto their skin.

The technology, if adopted by retailers and distributors, could put an end to the decades-long tradition of stickering fruit.

Fruit featuring the new technology is likely to hit British shelves shortly, with retailer Marks & Spencer recently signing an agreement with a laser printing company to trial it on oranges.

Marks & Spencer have said using the tattooing technology will be more environmentally sustainable.

Although the technology has been around since 2009, the use of these chemicals - which enhance the contrast between the lasered and non-lasered parts of the fruit making the mark much clearer - had previously been banned.

The amended EU regulations now allows the use of iron oxides, hydroxides, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and polysorbates for marking certain fruits.

The role of fruit stickers is not just to brand the fruit to a particular distributor. They also feature what's known as a a Price Look-up (PLU) code.

PLU codes tell the checkout computers not just what the item is and how much it costs, but also gives clues as to how its grown.

Traditionally grown fruit, using pesticides, features a four digit code.

But organically grown items, the number nine precedes the basic four digit PLU code, and on genetically modified fruit it is preceded by the number eight. 

Chiquita banana stickers from the 1960s are said to be the rarest.

The company claims to have been the first to label its bananas with stickers around this time and consequently their oldest are the most difficult to find, while they also retain a special aura of nostalgia for sticker collectors.
