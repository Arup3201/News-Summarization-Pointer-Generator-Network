Smug: Richard Oliver, 25, of Jarrow, South Tyneside, is pictured after walking free from Newcastle Crown Court on Friday

When police and paramedics responded to a 999 call about a badly damaged minibus they appeared to have a serious emergency to deal with.

Six ambulances took 13 men to hospital with what they claimed were serious injuries after they had ‘crashed’ on their way to a stag party.

But the ‘accident’ was a brazen scam designed to fool the authorities and get £134,000 from a false insurance claim for whiplash injuries. The men faked their injuries and made a ‘dramatic recovery’ after arriving in hospital.

 Some had been put in neck braces for the journey to A&E where they were given ‘unnecessary’ neck and spine X-rays, a court heard.

Police were suspicious as the group had no overnight bags or clothes for the weekend away  in Edinburgh – more than two hours’ drive from the crash scene in North Tyneside.

And when paramedics initially approached the minibus, driver Robert Paul, 45, and his passengers seemed to be ‘quite well’.

James Adkin, prosecuting, said: ‘The defendants were laughing, smoking and chatting on mobile phones. What followed was a domino effect as they began to hold their necks and say they had suffered injury.’

Despite being responsible for tying up NHS resources in a busy casualty unit, the gang walked free from Newcastle Crown Court on Friday with suspended jail sentences.

Judge David Wood told them: ‘If there had been a serious accident in this area on that night in which people were genuinely hurt or dying, the emergency services would have been unable to help them because they would be dealing with you.’

During a break in their sentencing hearing some of the gang went  outside the court. One of them, Richard Oliver, 25, pulled out a  wad of notes and showed them off, knowing that he was being photographed. The ‘accident’ happened in August 2009. The ‘crash for cash’ gang weren’t arrested until December 2011 after Aviva had compiled a dossier  of evidence.

Investigators working for the insurer 
discovered the minibus had been damaged elsewhere – probably by being 
driven into a post – and debris spread at the ‘crash’ scene on a slip 
road of the A193 near the Tyne Tunnel. The minibus was supposed to have 
collided with a Peugeot car, but the car had never been at the crash 
scene.

Ben LeBlond, the Peugeot’s owner, was a
friend of the stag-do ‘groom’, Stephen Paul, 28, and came forward 
claiming to have been driving it. His ‘passenger’, girlfriend Marnie 
Simpson, 21, also made a fake whiplash claim.

Community order: Miss Simpson had been under the pressure of her boyfriend, the court heard

The court heard the gang had lied to 
paramedics, doctors and insurers in an attempt to ‘line their own 
pockets’, but Aviva did not pay out any money.

Mr Adkin said insurance investigators 
discovered LeBlond was no stranger to the minibus group as he claimed 
but friends on Facebook with many of them.

Stephen and Robert Paul were given 12 month suspended jail terms and a £360 fine, and ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid work.

Oliver, Anthony Clark, 24, Jonathan 
Aurey, 24, Anthony Ward, 23, John Seymour, 23 and Daniel Laidler, 26, 
were given six-month suspended jail sentences and 150 hours of unpaid 
work. Oliver and Ward were also fined £360.

Karl Comarford, 25, Daniel Daymond, 23
and Daniel Ward, 28, received the same suspended jail term and fine, 
while Christopher Martin, 33, was given the same suspended jail term and
a 12-month supervision order.

Simpson was given a 12-month community
and supervision order and 150 hours of unpaid work. All 13 admitted 
fraud. Each is from South Tyneside.

LeBlond and two other men, who also pleaded guilty to fraud, are still awaiting sentence.
