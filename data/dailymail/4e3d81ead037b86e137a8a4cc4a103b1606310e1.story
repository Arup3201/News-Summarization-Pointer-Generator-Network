A two-headed tortoise has been born in Denmark.

Doctors at a reptile clinic were shocked when presented with the one-day-old animal. 

They took a video of the bizarre animal taking stock of its surroundings.   

The curious tortoise is unaware of the fuss and pokes both his heads out.

First one head peeks out and then another slowly follows. 

Vet Beth Fledelius who works in the clinic in Denmark posted the clip of the unusual creature on video-sharing website Storyful.

The condition, known as polycephaly occurs when twins fail to separate at birth.

Tortoises with this condition are said to be able to survive without difficulty.

A variation of the condition is when an animal is born with two faces on a single head, a condition known as diprosopus 

Other examples of polycephaly have occurred in various members of the animal kingdom.

There is a two-faced cat – known as a Janus cat named for the figure in Roman mythology with two faces on one head – in Massachusetts. 

Other instances include a Hereford calf in California with two heads, a two-headed bobtail lizard in Australia and a two-headed dolphin which was found in Turkey
