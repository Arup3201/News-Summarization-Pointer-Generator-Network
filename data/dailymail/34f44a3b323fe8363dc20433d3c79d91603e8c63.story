A former star of reality show 'Ice Road Truckers' was sentenced to five to 15 years in prison on Tuesday for kidnapping a Las Vegas prostitute who goes by the name 'Snow White'.

Timothy R. Zickuhr, who appeared on season two of the History Channel show 'Ice Road Truckers-Deadliest Roads', pleaded guilty to two felony charges of first degree kidnapping and extortionate collection of debt.

He has since also been linked to the robbery of an 80-year-old woman.

A biography for Zickuhr that remains on the History Channel's website for the reality show described him as a loudmouthed driver, 'brimming with personality.'

Timothy Zickuhr, who appeared on season two of the History Channel's reality show 'IRT Deadliest Roads', has been sentenced to 5 to 15 years  in prison for kidnapping and threatening a prostitute he said owed him money

Head bowed in court, Zickuhr kidnapped Lisa Cadeau, professionally known as 'Snow White', tied her up, poured ice water over her and beat her 

The criminal complaint against Zickuhr claimed that in December 2013, he demanded that Snow White, real name Lisa Cadeau, pay him $1,000.

He had given her his ATM card to retrieve cash to pay herself for sexual services. He claimed she had taken too much money from his account.

She agreed to meet him again to settle the dispute and when she did he punched her and threatened to kill her.

According to the filing, Zickuhr held Cadeau hostage, tied her up with backpack straps, poured ice-cold water over her from a bucket and beat her.

When Zickuhr asked her to give him the phone number of someone who would pay him what he was owed, the woman instead gave him the number for a Las Vegas police officer, Adam Seely, to whom she had provided information to in the past, according to the complaint and the officer's report.

He called the number and, not knowing he was speaking to a police officer, said that if he didn't get the money he was going to go to Mexico and kill Snow White.

He made two more calls to the officer and it was arranged that they would meet at a phone booth behind the Eureka casino.

Having heard a woman screaming, Zickuhr's neighbors called the police and he reportedly made Cadeau jump from a second-floor window onto a carport to avoid police detection.

They walked to the Eureka where officers were waiting to make an arrest, which they did after a brief foot chase. 

In his appearance on 'IRT Deadliest Roads' in 2011 Zickuhr  was sent to drive cargo across some of the scariest roads in Bolivia. The show went off the air after that season 

In addition to today's sentencing, Zikuhr is expected to be sentenced on an unrelated felony robbery charge on March 9 in Clark County

When he was taken into custody, Zickuhr admitted that he had made a mistake and went on to say that he had planned to place the woman on Craigslist and prostitute her for his financial benefit, The Las Vegas Sun reported in April.

Zickuhr joined the History Channel show in its second season, which filmed in 2011, and was sent to drive cargo across some of the scariest roads in Bolivia.

The show went off the air after that season and he has since returned to the United States. 

It was in Las Vegas on the night of December 18, 2013, when he had a tryst with Snow White.

Zickuhr is expected to be sentenced on an unrelated felony robbery charge on March 9 in Clark County.

In that case, to which he was linked by DNA, he allegedly knocked an 80-year-old woman to the ground outside the Palms Casino, fracturing her left femur and tearing her rotator cuff, the Las Vegas Review Journal reports.

He then yanked a fanny pack from her hip and tried to flee so quickly that he ran out of his flip flops, which police then collected and used to identify him.
