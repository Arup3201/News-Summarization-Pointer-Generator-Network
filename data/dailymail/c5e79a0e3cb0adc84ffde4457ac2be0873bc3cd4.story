Today should see the opening shots fired as the billion-dollar Apple v Samsung patent case gets underway in a San Jose courtroom.

The two bitter rivals are arguing over a cluster of phone patents, each alleging that the other is infringing on intellectual property as they vie for top place in the smartphone wars.

Both companies are seeking potentially billions of pounds from each other in royalties - and whatever decision the 10 people on the jury takes, it is likely to will change the industry forever.

Opening arguments are expected today to 
decide the merits of Apple claims that Samsung smartphones and computer 
tablets are 'illegal knockoffs' of the iPhone and iPad.

If the case goes Apple's way, Samsung may be forced to pay out $2.5billion, and experts say the Android community may find itself mired in lawsuits - with Google itself dragged into the fight.

If the case goes Samsung's way, Apple may need to pay out on patents owned by Samsung - and this may mean iPhone prices will increase.

Opening arguments in federal court will be followed by Apple calling its first witness, a company designer.

The witness lists of both sides are 
long on experts, engineers and designers and short on familiar names. 
Apple CEO Tim Cook, for example, is not scheduled to testify.

Apple filed a lawsuit against the 
South Korean company last year alleging smartphones and computer tablets
made by the world's largest technology company are illegal knockoffs of
Apple's popular iPhone and iPad products.

To the consumers, they are 
arch-rivals, with the Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone competing directly 
with the iPhone and being the runaway success of Android handsets.

In the courts the fighting is even 
more fierce, with Apple repeatedly trying to stop Samsung selling phones and tablets around
the world.

But in business, Samsung is one of 
Apple's top suppliers - and Apple will spend an estimated £7billion on Samsung 
parts for their products, including iPhones and iPads, this year.

The 
amount is expected to increase until at least 2014 under the current 
terms of their contract, according to a deal reported earlier this year.

The Korea Times said that Apple 
bought around £4.9billion worth of parts from Samsung in 2011 including 
displays, mobile application processors, NAND flash chips and mobile 
memory.

You will find Samsung processors, displays and memory chips inside the new iPad.

Apple's much-admired 'Retina' displays are also manufactured by Samsung.

Apple is demanding $2.5 billion in damages, an award that would dwarf the largest patent-related verdict to date.

Samsung countered that Apple is doing
the stealing and that some of the technology at issue - such as the 
rounded rectangular designs of smartphones and tablets - has been 
industry standards for years.

The case is just the latest skirmish 
between the companies over product designs. A similar trial began last 
week, and the two companies have been fighting in courts in the United 
Kingdom and Germany.

U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh last 
month ordered Samsung to pull its Galaxy 10.1 computer tablet from the 
U.S. market pending the outcome of the upcoming trial, though she barred
Apple attorneys from telling the jurors about the ban.

'That's a pretty strong statement 
from the judge and shows you what she thinks about some of Apple's 
claims,' said Brian Love, a Santa Clara University law professor and 
patent expert.

He said that even though the case 
will be decided by 10 jurors, the judge has the authority to overrule 
their decision if she thinks they got it wrong.

'In some sense the big part of the 
case is not Apple's demands for damages but whether Samsung gets to sell
its products,' said Mark A. Lemley, a Stanford Law School professor and
director of the Stanford Program in Law, Science, and Technology.

Lemley said a verdict in Apple's 
favor could send a message to consumers that Android-based products such
as Samsung's are in legal jeopardy.

A verdict in Samsung's favor, 
especially if it prevails on its demands that Apple pay its asking price
to certain transmission technology it controls, could lead to 
higher-priced Apple products.

Apple lawyers argue there is almost 
no difference between Samsung's products and Apple's and that Samsung 
internal documents show it copied Apple's iconic designs and its 
interface.

Samsung denies the allegation and 
counter-claims that Apple copied its iconic iPhone from Sony. Samsung 
lawyers noted the company has been developing mobile phones since 1991 
and that Apple jumped into the market in 2007.
