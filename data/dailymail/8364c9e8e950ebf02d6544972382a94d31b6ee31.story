The Spanish mayor of a popular expat town has come under fire for posting pictures of a pretend military invasion of Gibraltar on his Facebook page.

Fransisco Perez Trigueros was branded a 'fool' after using a mocked-up image of Spanish Army soldiers marching over Gibraltar's runway while fighter jets fly overhead.

The image also shows a Spanish flag flying over the British territory and an Osborne bull - Spain's unofficial national symbol - halfway up the Rock.

Controversy: Fransisco Perez Trigueros was branded a 'fool' after using a mocked-up image of Spanish Army soldiers marching over Gibraltar's runway while fighter jets fly overhead

Critics last night attacked the nationalist mayor of Callosa de Segura near Alicante.

Gibraltarian Jonathan Manasco said: 'It is fools like this that encourage others to violence and hatred.'

Ernest Romero told Trigueros to 'go to hell' on the website of a Gib-based activist group which flagged up his use of the picture.

And Robert Menez, urging the right-wing mayor to stop using Gibraltar as a smokescreen to deflect attention from Spain's 4.7 million unemployed, added ironically: 'He could be taken seriously by some.

'After all, if he rounds up all the unemployed he could probably invade China.'

Dispute: Simmering tension over the Rock escalated at the start of the month after Gibraltar dumped 70 concrete blocks in the sea to create an artificial reef and stop Spanish fishermen entering its waters

Trigueros, a member of the governing 
Popular Party which is at loggerheads with Britain over Gibraltar, got 
himself into hot water last month over an attack on nationalists living 
in Spain's Catalan region.

After the booing of Spain's 
national anthem at the opening of the Barcelona swimming world 
championships, he went on Facebook to rant: 'Lets give these s**** their
 bloody independence now so they leave us be.

'But build a 30-foot-high wall so we don't have to see them again.'

He later withdrew his comments and insisted he was only attacking the sort of Catalans who burnt the Spanish flag.

Political rivals accused him of behaving like a fascist and called on him to resign.

Anger: Spain responded by trying to choke Gibraltar with six-hour-long border queues and threatening to charge motorists £43 a time to cross the frontier

Callosa
 de Segura, home to around 18,000 inhabitants, is a 30-minute drive 
inland from the Costa Blanca resort of Torrevieja, nicknamed 'the Costa 
del Yorkshire' by some holidaymakers.

Its
 stunning setting at the foot of the Callosa de Segura mountains draws 
thousands of tourists to the town every summer and has attracted 
hundreds of expats fleeing the more-built up Costa resorts.

The town hall website can be read in eight languages including English, Romanian and Russian.

Simmering
 tension over the Rock escalated at the start of the month after 
Gibraltar dumped 70 concrete blocks in the sea to create an artificial 
reef and stop Spanish fishermen entering its waters.

Spain has never recognised the three nautical miles of sea around the British territory as Gibraltar's.

Spain
 responded by trying to choke Gibraltar with six-hour-long border queues
 and threatening to charge motorists £43 a time to cross the frontier.

Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo responded by accusing Spain of acting like international pariah North Korea.

An emergency phone call between Prime Minister David Cameron and his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rajoy failed to defuse the situation. Britain is now threatening legal action against Spain.

Mr Picardo was due to fly to London today for meetings with Mr Cameron and Foreign Secretary William Hague in the face of continued pressure from Spain at the border with Gibraltar.

Sporadic Guardia Civil checks caused tailbacks into and out of Gibraltar at peak times over the Bank Holiday weekend.
