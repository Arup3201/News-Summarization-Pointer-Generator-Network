A diagnosis of cancer is among the worst news anyone can receive.

But hundreds of thousands of patients have considered not telling close friends and family about their diagnosis, new research shows.

The main reason for keeping loved ones in the dark was to protect them worrying about the bad news.

Up to a quarter of people diagnosed with cancer say they considered not telling friends and family they were ill (file picture)

While women are generally known to be good communicators, the study found they were most likely to keep a diagnosis to themselves.

Of those questioned, 25 per cent said they had considered not telling family, compared to just 18 per cent of men.

The poll, commissioned for Bupa, also found there was a marked difference between not telling a spouse or partner about diagnosis, with 4 per cent of women considering it, compared to just 1 per cent of men. 

There are two million people in the UK living with or having survived cancer, according to the charity Macmillan.  

Nearly 20 per cent of adults polled knew someone who had decided not to tell a close family member or friend about their diagnosis.

However over half said they would respect the person's decision to keep a diagnosis to themselves.

But the rest admitted they would feel sad, disappointed  and shocked.

The main reason for patients keeping the diagnosis secret was to enable to life to carry on as normal as possible - or to protect those closest to them.

Half of people said it would to be avoid sympathy or special treatment, while a third simply wanted to manage and deal with it on their own. 

Jayne Molyneux, Cancer Healthcare Manager at Bupa, said: 'Every patient reacts differently to their cancer diagnosis.

'We are finding more patients choosing to keep their diagnosis to themselves and dealing with treatment on their own, or until they have come to terms with it.'

The cancer charity Macmillan explains some patients feel guilty, perhaps believing they have caused the cancer themselves in some way. 

It adds: 'However, in most cases it’s not clear what’s caused someone’s cancer. There is no reason to blame yourself.

'Although some of your family and friends may find it difficult to talk about your cancer, the best way to overcome this difficulty is often by talking. 

Even so, it’s not always easy telling family and friends about your illness.'
