Stricken Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba has spoken to family and friends, raising hopes the 23-year-old may recover from the cardiac arrest he suffered at Tottenham on Saturday.

Muamba asked about his son in his first words since waking from a coma.

The Bolton star turned to his fiance Shauna Magunda, recognised her, and said: 'Where's Josh?', a friend told the Daily Mirror.

His delighted fiance then tweeted: 'All your prayers are working people thank u so so much. To God be the glory.'

Progress: Michael Essien confirmed that Fabrice Muamba had spoken to family and friends as he recovers from a cardiac arrest suffered on Saturday at White Hart Lane

Support: A simple message for Muamba attached to flowers at the Reebok today

Muamba remains gravely ill in the London Chest Hospital, where he had been kept in a coma since collapsing at White Hart Lane.

But
on Monday night a statement released by Bolton and the hospital 
confirmed Muamba was breathing on his own and had communicated with his 
family.

'He is now able to breathe 
independently, without the aid of a ventilator and he is able to 
recognise family members and respond to questions appropriately,' said 
the statement. 'These are positive signs of progress.

'However, his condition remains 
serious and our medical staff in intensive care will continue to monitor
and treat him. His family and club would like to thank the media for 
continuing to respect their privacy at this time.'

Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien revealed Muamba had spoken to him in both English and French.

Earlier, Bolton said Muamba had moved
his arms and legs but warned ‘his long-term prognosis will remain 
unclear for some time.’ Given that Muamba’s heart stopped for two hours 
after his collapse, there remains fear he may have suffered brain 
damage.

The news came shortly after a friend 
of the player, Curtis Codrington, revealed Muamba had spoken ‘minimal 
words in English and French, which is better than nothing’.

He later Tweeted: 'I'm so happy I 
have seen hugged and kiss Muamba he remember me and spoke of our jokes 
of fellow Congo player chris samba this is so great' [sic].

Muamba's fiancee Shauna then wrote on
Twitter: 'All your prayers are working people thank u so so much. Every
prayer makes him stronger. To God be the glory.'

Bolton manager Owen Coyle — who has 
remained in London — said the former England Under 21 midfielder is 
going through a ‘brave fight’, adding that the club had been inundated 
with messages of support from players and fans, including one from David
Beckham.

On Monday fellow professionals Shaun  Wright-Phillips, Ashley Cole and Johan Djourou visited Muamba in hospital.

Update: Bolton boss Owen Coyle spoke off Fabrice Muamba continuing his 'brave fight' to save his life at the London Chest Hospital

‘There is real hope he can come through this,’ said Coyle.

He added: 'The message is the good 
will, the prayers from everybody, they are so thankful and they want to 
put that on record - to say "keep up the prayers, thanks for all the 
support".

'They have been inundated as we all 
have, both in the football community globally and family and friends. 
People are taking a genuine interest and a real concern with how Fabrice
is doing.'

'We all know he's such a wonderful 
lad, he's a young man and we all hope that will help in this brave fight
which he is undergoing at the moment.

'It's a difficult situation but the family are bearing up as well as they can. They themselves are very positive people.

'You look at what Fabrice has been 
through in life already and you can tell that he is a fighter. He has 
such a fantastic smile and that's what we all want to see again.'

Bolton skipper Kevin Davies also described Muamba as a 'fighter'.

He said: 'Fabrice is fighting and we 
are all hoping he will pull through. I spoke to the manager and the 
doctor this morning and his condition remains criticial. I have been 
speaking to the manager and I have travelled back with the chairman. He 
went back down to support Fabrice and his family.

'It was optional to come into 
training today and decisions will have to be made but my immediate 
thoughts are with Fabrice and his family. The club will take a stance on
(the next game) in the next couple of days. But at the minute we want 
to just try and help Fabrice.'

Vigil: Jermain Defoe and his mother Sandra visited Muamba at the hospital in east London

Premier League officials have advised
the club to take each day as it comes before deciding whether to fulfil
their home fixture with Blackburn this Saturday.

But at some point the Premier League,
who are planning to review their medical testing policies, will join 
forces with the FA in discussing what can be learned from the incident. 
One possibility is the introduction of mandatory annual heart 
examinations for all players.

Muamba’s emergency medical care on 
Saturday owed much measures implemented in the wake of Petr Cech’s head 
injury at Reading in October 2006.

And it was as the result of a tragedy
in 1995 that heart examinations were made mandatory for all scholars, 
aged between 16 and 17, signing for professional Premier League 
academies.

Shock: Owen Coyle and players from both sides show their concern for Fabrice Muamba

John Marshall, a 16-year-old England 
schoolboy international, died from a heart attack the day before he was 
due to join Everton. It transpired he suffered from arrhythmogenic right
ventricular cardiomyopathy and only last year his sister Hayley called 
for testing to be introduced for young people.

‘Twelve people a week die of these cardiomyopathies,’ she said in support of the charity, Cardiac Risk in the Young.

On Monday FIFA president Sepp Blatter
wrote to Bolton chairman Phil Gartside to offer support, while the 
Sunderland squad stopped at the Reebok Stadium en route to Blackburn for
Tuesday's Barclays Premier League match to look at tributes to Muamba.

Critical condition: The London Chest Hospital, who released a joint statement with Bolton Wanderers FC (below), in east London where Muamba remains under care

Bolton’s game against Aston Villa has
been postponed, while no decision has been made about Saturday’s match 
or about the club continuing in the FA Cup.

But Spurs boss Harry Redknapp confirmed his side’s league clash at home to Stoke on Wednesday would go ahead as planned.

He said: ‘They need to play. I think they are OK. The best thing for them is to get back on the pitch and play.’

Some of his players had ECG tests when a cardiologist made a routine visit to the training ground.

Referee Howard Webb, praised for his 
handling of the situation at White Hart Lane, is set to return on 
Wednesday as QPR host Liverpool.
