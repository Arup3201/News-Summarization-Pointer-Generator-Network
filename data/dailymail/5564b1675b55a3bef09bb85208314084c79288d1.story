A man accused of stalking news anchor Anderson Cooper claims it was nothing but a harmless ‘crush’.

Alex Hausner, 40, also claimed the feelings were mutual and that charges had been brought by Mr Cooper’s ‘jealous’ boyfriend.

Hausner claims Anderson Cooper’s partner Benjamin Maisani is threatened by their ‘mutual crush’ which, according to him, dates back to 2007.

According to Hausner, their 'relationship' began when Mr Cooper bumped into him in New York’s Union Square and passed him a compliment.

He also claimed that the CNN newscaster has been sending him subliminal messages through his television show ever since.

Hausner pleaded ‘not guilty at all,’ to felony menacing, stalking and harassment at Manhattan Supreme Court, claiming it was indeed Mr Cooper who had begun their ‘mutual crush’ when he told him ‘you’re hot’ at their first meeting.

‘I have a crush on Anderson, he is not in any danger,’ Hausner, a former psychiatric patient, told police upon his arrest last month.

This is in sharp contrast to the report of Hausner’s most recent stalker attack on the journalist where he kicked down Anderson Cooper’s front door and threatened to ‘f*** him up’.

Hausner has also been caught on CCTV threatening Anderson Cooper’s boyfriend Benjamin Maisani.

‘He wants me out of the way and he’s trumping up charges,’ he told the court today.

Hausner also made threatening phone calls to CNN, Anderson Cooper’s place of work.

‘He stated to the head of security there that “if you want a war, war is about to come, the worst is about to come”,’ Prosecutor Rachel Ehrhardt said, according to the New York Post.

A judge ordered a psychiatric examination and remanded Hausner who is being held in lieu of $75,000 bail.
