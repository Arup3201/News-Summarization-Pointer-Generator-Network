Olive Garden's limited number of 'never-ending pasta passes' sold out in two hours today, the company announced on Monday afternoon.

The $100 golden ticket allows carb lovers to fill up on as much of the chain's signature dishes as they can eat. From 3pm today, fans of the chain were able to buy a ticket to eat as much pasta as possible - along with bread sticks, salad bar and soup - for seven weeks between September 22 and November 9.

Only 1,000 of the passes were sold and covered the 150 pasta dishes available at Olive Garden from five-cheese ziti al forno to lasagna classico and spaghetti meatballs.

The deal also includes unlimited soft drinks for the pass-holder and those at their table - but no alcohol.

The pass can be used once a day (but also every day) at Olive Garden locations across the U.S.

The attention-grabbing promo comes at a tricky time for the chain. In July, the CEO and Chairman Clarence Otis stepped down as the Darden Restaurants company fights to fix its flagship Olive Garden chain following its contested sale of Red Lobster.

For fans of the Olive Garden chain, getting value for money from the $100 pass should be simple - and done in under a week.

Using only options available on the pass, a dinner of minestrone soup followed by spaghetti meatballs, a house salad and bread, typically costs roughly $36 (before tip).

Sticking to the pass's one use, once-a-day rule, then Olive Garden fans can chomp their way through $100, in just three sittings. 

The company, based in Orlando, Florida, has been pressured to turn around declining sales at Olive Garden and Red Lobster. 

Customers had begun turning away from those chains as they cut back on spending during the recession.

Darden Restaurants Inc. completed the sale of Red Lobster to investment firm Golden Gate Capital in July.

There has also been concern from diners over the calorie contents of those bottomless pasta bowls.  

Olive Garden boasts a significant amount of meals that have more calories, saturated fat and sodium than is recommended - and even more than a McDonald's value meal, according to a Drexel University-University of Pennsylvania study in January.

The Herb Cheese Soffatelli with Chicken (1,530 cal and 107g of fat) and Pork Milanese (1,510 cal and 87g of fat are two of the highest calorie items on the Italian chain's menu.

All you can eat: The pass allows the diner to eat as many pasta dishes as they want from the Olive Garden chain over a seven-week period
