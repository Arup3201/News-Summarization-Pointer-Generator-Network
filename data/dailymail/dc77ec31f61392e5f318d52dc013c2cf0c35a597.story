Poland's first gay and transgender politicians will sit on the front bench of Parliament this week after Nobel Peace Prize winner Lech Walesa said homosexual lawmakers should sit behind a wall.

The former president, who helped lead Poland's peaceful transition from Communism, provoked outrage last week when he said homosexuals should not 'climb all over the majority'.

Despite the anger his comment caused, Walesa refused to apologise today and said he had been misunderstood.

Robert Biedron, the progressive party Palikot's Movement's first openly gay lawmaker, will sit on the front bench this week.

The party's leader Janusz Palikot has also promoted transgender lawmaker Anna Grodzka to the front row for a three-day session starting on Wednesday.

The front row, which is closest to the Speaker and gets the most television attention, is generally reserved for party leaders and senior lawmakers in Poland's Parliament. The Cabinet sits in a 
separate section.

Walesa's comments even provoked a rebuke from his son Jaroslaw Walesa, who is a politician at the European Parliament.

He said homosexual politicians should be in Parliament, adding: 'Gays, lesbians, the homosexuals, have the right to have a representation.'

Walesa's son said he was shocked by his father's words, which 'should not have been said.'

Walesa angered liberal Poles when he was interviewed on news channel TVN 24 about homosexual rights.

He was speaking after 
parliament defeated draft laws that would have given limited legal 
rights to homosexual couples.

When asked about where homosexuals should sit in the parliamentary chamber, he said: 'No minority should climb all over the majority. Homosexuals should even sit behind a wall, and not somewhere at the front.

'They must know they are a minority and adapt themselves to smaller things.'

Ryszard Nowak, a former conservative 
member of parliament, reported Walesa to the prosecutor's office late on
Saturday, accusing him of promoting hatred of sexual minorities.

'The report was filed on Saturday, 
when the office is closed,' prosecutors' office spokeswoman Barbara 
Sworobowicz told Reuters.

'We will examine it, starting on Monday, if it
meets the legal definition of a crime.'

Palikot said: 'Walesa's words contradict democracy because that form of government is based on protecting minorities.'

Biedron invited the former president to a meeting to discuss homosexual rights, which has been declined.

Biedron said in a separate interview on TVN 24: 'Walesa was a hero. I dream of meeting 
Walesa and talking to him about it.

'I think Walesa doesn't realise the kind of society we are now. Walesa went astray somewhere.'

Walesa became a world-famous dissident when he campaigned for human rights and freedom in Poland's communist era.

In the 1980s Walesa, a Roman Catholic, led the Solidarity freedom movement that peacefully toppled communism in Poland.

He served as president between 1990 and 1995.

Poland has been struggling with issues such as gay rights, abortion, legalisation of soft drugs and the role of the church in public life as younger Poles seeking a more secular society clash with a deeply religious older generation. 

The Senate will discuss whether to press outgoing Czech President Vaclav Klaus with high treason

The Czech parliament's upper house is meeting to discuss whether to charge outgoing President Vaclav Klaus with high treason.

Mr Klaus provoked protests and legal concerns when he announced an amnesty to nearly one third of prisoners in January.

Up to 7,000 inmates were eligible for freedom in the plans, which he said was done to 'give a fresh chance' to people who were not repeat offenders and to mark 20 years of independence.

Prisoners serving sentences of more than 10 years were not affected and all inmates older than 75 years, providing they were serving a short sentence, and those serving less than one year were eligible for release.

Mr Klaus infuriated many Czechs when court proceedings in several high-profile fraud cases and financial scams were halted as part of the amnesty.

Only the Czech Senate has the power to file high treason charges at the Constitutional Court.

A majority of lawmakers in the 81-seat house, which is controlled by the left-wing opposition, has to approve that to happen. Today's session will be held behind closed doors. 

The worst punishment Klaus faces is the loss of the presidential job and his final term in office ends Thursday.
