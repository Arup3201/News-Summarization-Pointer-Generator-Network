Women with breast cancer are being urged to exercise as there is no evidence it worsens painful symptoms, according to the health watchdog.

Around 10,000 of those diagnosed with the illness each year on to develop lymphoedema, which leads to pain and loss of mobility in arms and legs.

In the past they were urged by doctors to avoid exercise as it was thought to make the condition worse but NICE states this isn't the case.

Guidelines from the watchdog today state that moderate physical activity such as housework, gardening or walking will also help improve their overall health.

In addition, breast cancer is linked to obesity and increasing evidence has found that staying active reduces the chances of the cancer returning.

The condition affects 1 in 5 of the 50,500 women diagnosed with breast cancer in Britain a year and occurs when the lymph nodes are damaged by surgery or radiotherapy.

It causes pain in the knees, elbows and other joints and swelling of the limbs which can be extremely severe.

In the past, women were advised not to exercise over concerns it worsens symptoms but recent evidence has shown this isn't the case.

Breast cancer is also linked to obesity and there is increasing evidence the illness is far more likely to return if women are even mildly overweight.

Professor Mark Baker, Director of the NICE’s Centre for Clinical Practice, said: ‘Lymphoedema can have a significant effect on someone’s life, making once routine tasks difficult and painful.

‘It may also have an impact on a person’s self-confidence and mental health depending on how severe the condition is.

‘Our new recommendations make clear the link between exercise and breast cancer-related lymphoedema to help people manage this often distressing condition.

‘Although exercise will not prevent it, evidence shows that it will not cause lymphoedema or make existing symptoms worse either.’

Doctors advise women with lymphodeamia to do stretching exercises and also to stay as active as they can without hurting the affected muscles.

They are urged to undertake moderate activity such as housework, gardening and walking but to avoid lifting heavy furniture as this may cause pain in the affected joints. 

Rachel Rawson, Clinical Nurse Specialist at Breast Cancer Care, said: ‘Lymphoedema after breast cancer treatment can be devastating.

‘It attacks confidence and self-esteem and can reduce a person’s quality of life.

‘Knowing that exercise can be beneficial will give confidence to those living with the condition.

‘Exercise can also help maintain or improve health for anyone diagnosed with breast cancer.

‘Regular movement every day can help keep joints supple and aid lymph drainage and extra exercises can also be useful if swelling restricts movement of the arm.’
