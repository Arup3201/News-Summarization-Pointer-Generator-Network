A 75-year-old grandmother on trial for murdering her grandson sobbed on the witness stand today as she described how she repeatedly shot the teenager after he kicked her in the stomach and demanded cash and her car keys so he could flee Michigan.

Rocking back and forth in her chair, Sandra Layne said she 'adored' the 17-year-old, Jonathon Hoffman, whom she took into her Detroit-area home after his parents divorced and moved to Arizona, but their relationship became strained after he began taking drugs.

'Did you want to kill this young man?' defense attorney Jerome Sabbota asked. 'Of course not. I still love him,' Layne replied.

She told jurors that Hoffman used drugs and spent time with friends whom she didn't know or trust.

Layne said he couldn't control his temper if things went wrong, destroying computer equipment and kicking doors and the car dashboard.

On the day of the shooting, Layne said, Hoffman had flunked a drug test and was at risk of being sent to jail for violating probation in a marijuana case. She said he demanded $2,000 and the keys to her car. Layne said she feared for her safety.

'I went into my bedroom and started looking for the gun,' she said, crying and rocking in the chair as she testified. 'I wanted him to pay attention to me. He had to listen. It wasn't a conversation. It was arguing. Swearing.'

Tragic: There's no dispute Layne repeatedly shot 17-year-old Jonathan Hoffman last May in their Detroit-area home

Scared: Sandra Layne, pictured leaving the stand for a recess on Wednesday, said she shot her grandson in self-defense because she feared he would harm her

She said she shot Hoffman after he kicked her and struck her in the head. Layne then rushed to the basement from a third-floor loft to hide. She said she returned and shot the teen again after he grabbed for the gun.

'I was afraid it would start all over again,' Layne testified.

Authorities said Layne of West Bloomfield Township fired 10 shots, striking Hoffman six times, even while he was on the phone with 911 begging for help.

During her trial last week, prosecutors described how an already wounded Hoffman pleaded with a 
911 dispatcher to send help as Layne shot him again on May 18 last year.

Hoffman 'thought he was safe... Sandra Layne walks up and 
shoots him again. This time in the stomach,' Paul Walton, Oakland 
County's chief assistant prosecutor, said during his opening statement on March 5.

Defense attorney Jerome 
Sabbota countered that the diminutive Layne feared for her safety during
the fatal confrontation in the West Bloomfield Township 
condo that Hoffman shared with his grandparents.

An autopsy revealed 
Hoffman was shot three times in the chest, once in the abdomen and once 
in his left arm. Tests showed the teen had traces of synthetic marijuana
in his body.

Officers had been called to the home northwest of 
Detroit about two months earlier, when Layne told police she was having a
difficult time because her grandson was very upset and yelling. No 
arrests were made that day.

Four days before that, the alternative high school senior was 
pulled over in nearby Farmington Hills and ticketed for possession of 
marijuana and drug paraphernalia.

Layne is 'not a 
murderer,' Sabbota told jurors. 'She was afraid. She felt she 
had no choice. Why else would she shoot him? This is a tragic case.'

Hoffman was living with his grandmother while his mother and father were divorcing and living outside Michigan.

'He was a troubled teen, her favorite grandson, and she took him in,' Sabbota said.

In
Hoffman's 911 call played during Layne's preliminary examination last 
summer, the teen yelled into a cellphone: 'I've just been shot. My 
grandma shot me. I'm going to die. Help.'

Ordeal: The grandmother is accused of shooting her grandson multiple times at the home they shared last May

A few minutes later, he 
tells the operator: 'I got shot, shot again. Please help. Help,' before 
his voice trails off and a woman's shouts are heard in the background.

An
officer testified at Layne's preliminary examination that when police 
arrived, she walked out of her home with her hands up and screamed: 'I 
murdered my grandson.'

A Glock 9mm semiautomatic handgun was found just inside the front door. Nine spent cartridge cases also were found in the house.

Crime scene: When police arrived on the scene they found Hoffman unresponsive with eight bullet wounds
