Old Harrovian Neil Heywood was murdered because he threatened to expose the corrupt ownership of a luxury French Riviera villa by a powerful Chinese couple, it was claimed today.

Heywood’s close relationship with the politically elite Bo family quickly soured after he was accused of withholding the ‘£800,000 rent’ from the £2million hilltop mansion near Cannes.

Speaking at the trial of disgraced top Communist Party chief Bo Xilai,  Heywood’s killer Gu Kailai – the estranged wife of Bo – alleged in a video testimony that the Briton became angry when told he would no longer be a partner in the lucrative property.

Scandal: Disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai 
is shown seated in court in Jinan, in eastern 
China's Shandong province, as he stands trial on charges related to the murder of British
 businessman Neil Heywood

The couple ‘were given’ the 
six-bedroom bougainvillea-clad mansion overlooking Cannes  -  complete 
with a patio swimming pool, 4,000-square-meter garden and views of the 
Mediterranean -  in 2000 as a ‘gift’ from a Chinese billionaire 
businessman, Xu Ming.

‘The plan was to rent it out to make some money’, Gu told the court in Jinan as she testified against her husband.

She
 said she transferred ownership of Villa Fontaine Saint Georges to 
Heywood and another family friend, named as Patrick Devillers, a French 
architect, in 2007 to hide it from the authorities as her husband rose 
through the political ranks.

But
 she claimed Heywood and Devillers were refusing to hand over the rent 
they collected so in early 2011 she told them she was ending the 
arrangement and would terminate their stake in the property.

Murdered: Bo's wife Gu Kailai admitted to killing Mr Heywood, pictured, by poisoning him with cyanide and received a suspended death sentence

Gu, 54,
 said Heywood, 41, attempted to blackmail the couple by demanding £1.4m 
to walk away from the deal - money he claimed he was owed - and 
threatened to expose the couple’s corrupt ownership of the villa if his 
demands were not met.

He also threatened the safety the couple’s 25-year-old son Guagua, she claimed.

Her
 statement pieces together to the murky sequence of events that led to 
the murder of the Harrow-educated Heywood, a father of two, in November 
2011.

Shortly before his 
death, the China-based Briton told friends he felt threatened by couple 
and had left documents detailing their overseas investments with his 
lawyer in Britain as an “insurance policy” in case anything happened to 
him.

He was later lured by 
Gu  to a hotel room in Chongqing, where Bo was party chief,    to 
discuss ‘business’ but was allegedly poisoned by Gu’s henchman.

On Gu’s orders, police hastily cremated his body and Heywood’s family was told he had died from alcohol abuse

But
 it was alleged Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun secretly took a body 
sample from the morgue, which he later took to US officials after a bust
 up with his boss, Bo.

Wang’s
 flight to a US consulate and request for asylum sparked China’s biggest
 political scandal in decades and Bo - once tipped as a potential leader
 - was arrested 18 months ago.

He
 is now on trial accused of bribery, corruption and abuse of power - the
 latter charged related to his allege cover up of Heywood’s murder by 
his wife.

‘He should know about it all,’ Gu said, referring to Bo as he listened from the dock.

Gu was given a suspended death sentence last year for killing Heywood and is likely to remain in jail for life.

The on-going trial is exposing the greed, machinations and betrayal in one of China’s elite families.

The 'Villa fontaine Saint-Georges' in Cannes, south-east France, which Gu's testimony claimed was a gift to her family from a corrupt businessman and at the centre of her dispute with Mr Heywood that led her to murder him

Bo, 64 , dismissed his estranged wife claims and called her a ‘crazy’ convicted killer.

He
 also disputed the state prosecution’s claim that the numerous gifts – 
including rare African bush meat, flights, business deals and cash 
payments - his family received amounted to bribes and he denied he had 
provided any political favours in exchange for them.

‘Kailai has changed, she’s crazy, and she’s always making things up,' Bo told the court.

‘Under conditions where her mental state is abnormal, the investigators put her under immense pressure to expose me,’ he said.

The
 lurid details have a serious political side with the ruling Communist 
Party using the trial to purge Bo, a charismatic and popular former 
Politburo member tipped for high office.

He
 is expected to be found guilty in what many see as ‘show trial’ by the 
authorities to show an increasingly critical public it is serious about 
cracking down on rampant corruption among ruling party members.

testimony in which she says a businessman gave their family gifts 
including a French villa, airline tickets and a Segway scooter. She was 
convicted of murder in August last year

Heywood’s Chinese wife and their two young children remain in Beijing but refuse to discuss his death.

His
 mother, Ann Heywood, from south London, broke her silence last week, 
issuing a statement calling on the Chinese authorities to show 
‘decisiveness and compassion’ over the family’s request to seek 
financial compensation.

She 
said she was disappointed that Beijing had so far failed to give the 
family any response despite  ‘repeated discreet approaches’.
