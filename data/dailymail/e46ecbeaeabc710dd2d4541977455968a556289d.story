Nick Clegg tore into David Cameron's pledge to protect pensioner benefits for millionaires as neither 'explicable or justifiable'

Nick Clegg yesterday tore into David Cameron’s ‘completely irrational’ decision to protect benefits for wealthy pensioners while imposing cuts on the rest of society.

The Lib Dem leader launched an extraordinary attack on the pledge made by his coalition partner that free bus passes, TV licences and winter fuel allowances would continue for all pensioners, including wealthy over-65s like Peter Stringfellow and Alan Sugar.

Mr Clegg said he would be ‘gobsmacked’ if Mr Cameron repeated the promise in the Tory manifesto in 2015, which he predicted would be the ‘first full-blown scarcity election’.

Ahead of the last election Mr Cameron told voters they could ‘read my lips’ as he vowed not all pensioner benefits would continue.

But yesterday Mr Clegg said it was not fair on public sector workers or people on working age benefits who have been hit with real terms cuts to continue to fund giveaways for millionaires.

Mr Cameron is coming under growing pressure from senior ministers to drop the pledge or risk appearing to be shelter traditionally Conservative voters from cuts.

In a contemptuous swipe at the Tories, Mr Clegg said: ‘When you are having to make… unprecedented savings, the idea that you exempt millionaire and multimillionaire pensioners uniquely from further savings is completely irrational.

‘I would be gobsmacked in that context if any sensible, responsible political party will somehow think its explicable or justifiable that millionaire or multimillionaire pensioners are not going to be affected at all.’

Mr Clegg said it was 'irrational' to protect benefits for millionaire pensioners like Peter Stringfellow and Alan Sugar while capping public sector pay and tax credits

Mr Clegg claimed even most wealthy pensioners did not think they should be exempt from austerity..

Nick Clegg struck a blow for the cool 
reputation of onesies when he became the most high profile politician to
date who owns an all-in-one.

In the final question on his new LBC radio 
phone-in, Mr Clegg disclosed that he owned a 'big green' onesie - but
he had never worn it.

'I
was given a big green onesie which I have kept in its packaging. I have
got one but I haven't worn it yet. It will be something I do in the 
privacy of my own home,' he added.

He later joked he was a 'Onesie Nation politician'.

The Prime Minister's spokesman declined to say whether David Cameron owned a onesie.

‘Let me make a prediction. Any political party who goes into the next general committing to not touch a single hair on the head of benefits for the most affluent pensions in this country will be found out very quickly,’ he told journalists at a parliamentary lunch.

‘You cannot ask people to take big cuts in their housing benefit, in their other benefits and say it’s OK for Peter Stringfellow and Alan Sugar to be given a whole bunch of free benefits when they don’t need it, paid for by other taxpayers.’

However, Mr Clegg insisted he did not 
back a call from former Lib Dem minister Paul Burstow that the winter 
fuel allowance, worth up to £300 to over-80s, be limited to just the 
2million poorest pensioners.

‘The question is where do you have the cut off. We haven’t decided as a party,’ he added.

Mr Clegg predicted that parties would offer two-tier manifesto commitments for 2015, to prepare for another coalition government. He said they would have to establish which policies they would ‘die in a ditch’ for, and which ones were negotiable. 

Of his party’s infamous U-turn on raising university tuition fees, he said: ‘We’re not going to make that mistake again.’

Mr Clegg said there was a ‘principled case’ that when doctors, teachers and nurses have had payrises capped at one per cent and benefits are capped at one per cent, it was wrong to say :

‘Oh and by the way Alan Sugar you carry on – whether he receives it or not - carry on with your tax-subsidised entitlement to winter fuel payments, TV licences…

What a difference: It was all smiles on Monday when Clegg, left, and Cameron presented their Mid-Term Review

‘The next general election in my view is going to be the first full-blown scarcity election.’

Chris Huhne should return  to the Cabinet if he is cleared of making his ex-wife take his speeding points, Nick Clegg said yesterday.

Asked if he hoped the former energy secretary, pictured, would return to front-line politics, the Liberal Democrat leader said: ‘I would like to see Chris if he is cleared of everything. He’s an old colleague and a friend of mine and I want to see him at the top table of British politics.’ 

Mr Huhne is facing criminal charges for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice over claims that he persuaded Vicky Pryce to take his penalty points for a speeding offence in 2003.

He also backed another round of 
leadership debates featuring himself, Mr Cameron and Labour leader Ed 
Miliband – but resisted calls for UK Independence Party leader Nigel 
Farage to be included, even though UKIP’s poll ratings are now nearly 
double those of the Lib Dems.

‘The format we had before [at the last general election] was a good one,’ he said.

Yesterday Ken Clarke became the 
latest senior Conservative minister to signal that the Tory pledge to 
protect universal benefits must be ditched in the next election 
manifesto.

‘Before the 
election the Labour party started putting out leaflets accusing us of 
planning to take away benefits from pensioners,' he said.

‘Very rapidly a promise was given that we wouldn’t reduce benefits to pensioners,’ he told BBC Radio 4.

'We
actually tied ourselves down for this parliament not addressing them.

'They, I’m sure, when we get round, which we haven’t yet, contemplating 
our manifesto for the next election they’ll be an agenda item.’
