Linebacker: Monty Ray Grow played for the Kansas City Chiefs for a season in 1994, alongside Joe Montana, and the Jacksonville Jaguars in 1995

A former NFL linebacker has been arrested in Florida after he left a toddler in a car while he visited a strip club.

Monty Ray Grow, who has played for the Kansas City Chiefs and the Jacksonville Jaguars, left the three-year-old girl locked in the parking lot of a car dealership in Tampa Bay and popped into the Diamond Dolls erotic nightclub on Sunday night.

Police said she was found by her mother and grandparents more than 40 minutes later after they used GPS to track her down.

By the time Grow returned from the club they had taken the girl away, replaced by waiting officers.

It is unclear exactly how long the toddler was in the car but police said her mother tracked her down at 9.09pm, arrived to pick her up six minutes later before Grow emerged from the club at 9.48pm.

The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office said Grow, of Redington Beach, was charged with child abuse Sunday night and was later released on $5,000 bail.

It would not reveal his relationship to the little girl, saying only that he was supposed to be caring for her.

When Grow returned to the car, he reportedly acknowledged leaving the uninjured child unattended.

Grow played linebacker for the Gators from 1989 to 1993. He went on to play a season each for the Kansas City Chiefs and the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Diamond Dolls claims on its website to be a 'powerhouse of a gentleman's club' where patrons are 'titillated and pampered by over 90 beautiful girls on stage and in 
private show'.

It adds: 'Diamond Dolls full liquor bar will keep your
thirst quenched from the minute you arrive. On any given day or night 
you can relax with your favorite beverage served by our friendly, 
curvaceous bar staff.'

Grow played for the Kansas City Chiefs for a season in 1994, alongside Joe Montana, and the Jacksonville Jaguars in 1995.

While Grow is now retired, the behaviour of NFL players, in particularly the younger generation, has fallen under the spotlight in recent months.

Last month an investigation revealed that 27 top-flight players have been arrested since
the Super Bowl - including two on suspicion of murder.

They include New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez, who was charged 
with first-degree murder in the death of Odin Lloyd, and Cleveland Browns rookie Ausar Walcott, charged 
with attempted murder for allegedly punching a man in the head
outside a club in New Jersey.

The startling expose has raised serious questions over how well the game's 
clubs nurture their their players.

Other well-known players who have fallen foul of the law during the offseason include Cincinnati Bengals cornerback Adam 'Pacman' Jones for allegedly assaulting a 
woman at a nightclub and Philadelphia Eagles offensive lineman Jason Peters, arrested for allegedly drag racing and trying to elude police.
