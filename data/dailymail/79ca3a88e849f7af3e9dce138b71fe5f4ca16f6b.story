A stunning waterfront property in one of Sydney’s most affluent suburbs has sold  for a staggering $27 million in an off-market deal.

Located on Dumaresq Road in Rose Bay, the beautiful three-storey home delivers an outstanding beachfront allotment with spectacular views of the city and the Harbour Bridge.

The sale comes after the previous owners - technology innovator Kevin Bermeister and his wife Beverley - purchased a $9.5million luxurious clifftop property in Dover Heights back in August.

One of Sydney’s most affluent suburbs has sold a waterfront property for a staggering price in an off-market deal for $27 million

The Sydney entrepreneur was born in South Africa before living in the Rose Bay mansion with his family near the water for the past few years.

Bermeister, who created the file sharing service called Kazaa, reached a $150 million settlement in 2005 after being sued by the music industry over his business.

Although it's not traditionally one of the more glamorous rooms in any home, this property's stunning bathroom could surely compete with any in Sydney. It offers panoramic views from the tub across to the city and Harbour Bridge - perfect for the new owners to kick off after a long day.

Experts believe the new home owners could be from overseas. The sale follows after the new owners missed out on the Point Piper oceanfront property when it sold in October for a cool $30 million, according to Domain.

While the sale tops an impressive run of pre-Christmas sales, the real estate agent has been kept under wraps but McGrath Estate Agents' Ben Collier might be the man behind the deal.

The 789 square metre modern property has had a major overhaul by architect Bruce Stafford since it was last traded in 2006 for an asking price of $14.2 million, Domain reports.

The whopping sale has broken the Rose Bay record after a contemporary waterfront home on Bayview Hill Road sold for $18.2 million in 2006.
