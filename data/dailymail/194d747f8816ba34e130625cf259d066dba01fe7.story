His decision to turn down not one but four investment offers amounting to £75,000 from TV’s Dragons’ Den was greeted with shock and disbelief.

But the gamble seems to have paid off and now 26-year-old  entrepreneur Ryan O’Rorke, from Edinburgh, the man behind gourmet food, snacks and craft beer subscription club Flavourly, has raised more than £300,000 through crowd-funding platform Crowdcube.

The figure is four times greater than the sum offered by the Dragons (for a 20 per cent stake) on the programme broadcast last month.

On Saturday 21 March, O'Rorke's company hit its £300,000 target in exchange for a 23 per cent stake in the business. 

By Monday morning, the venture was overfunding, having raised £333,220 from 256 investors. The largest single investment has been £50,000. 

Mr O’Rorke said: ‘We’re over the moon to have smashed our £300,000 target. And it hasn’t stopped there – the bids are still flying in.

'We’re thrilled that hundreds of public investors have embraced Flavourly with such enthusiasm. 

'We’ve huge plans ahead and this investment will enable us to accelerate our mission to become the go-to destination of gourmet food, snacks and craft beer across Europe.’

Having seen his father, an amateur honey maker, struggle to sell products outside his local circle,  Mr O’Rorke found 75 per cent of small British producers do not have the resources or infrastructure to sell direct to consumers or the multiples.

Mr O’Rorke launched Flavourly in November 2012 from his grandmother’s garage in Edinburgh. 

Flavourly selects the finest independently-produced gourmet food, snacks and craft beer and delivers them in a package to customers each month. 

Popular products include bacon jam, chilli popcorn and venison, mushroom and whisky pasta sauce.

Since its launch the company has grown 500 per cent year on year, shipping more than 500,000 products from over 300 small British producers.

Its craft beer club was launched in 2014 and received 4,000 orders on the first day.

Flavourly has helped break many small producers into the mainstream markets and recently launched its online marketplace where customers can rebuy favourite items at the most affordable prices on the web.

On Dragons’ Den last month, O’Rorke was seen pitching for £75,000 and received four separate investment offers, plus a job offer from Kelly Hoppen.

Viewers saw O’Rorke accept a joint bid from Piers Linney and Peter Jones in exchange for a 20 per cent stake of the business.

However, following the show’s recording, O’Rorke and Flavourly CEO Assean Sheikh decided to decline the Dragons’ offer and pursue other investment opportunities.
