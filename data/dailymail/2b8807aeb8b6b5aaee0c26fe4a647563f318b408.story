The mother of an 11-year-old boy beaten to death by his father at cricket training has spoken of her devastation of trying to rebuild a life without her son.

Luke Batty was killed with a cricket bat and knife when his deranged father Greg Anderson attacked him in the Melbourne suburb of Tyabb in February.

His mum, Rosie Batty, has now recalled the anger she felt after being told 'you'll always be a mum, Rosie' by someone trying to comfort her following Luke's murder, which occurred just metres from where she and other children were standing.

'I was angry. I said "I'm not a bloody mother anymore. I have a memory but I'm not",' she told The Age.

'I have to rebuild a life with some direction and meaning because I'm not a mother anymore and all the things I did with Luke, either for him, or with him or because of him, it's all gone.'

The home Ms Batty shared with Luke is a constant reminder of a future without her son – there's a swimming pool, cubby house, donkeys, goats, sheep and three dogs.

Since Luke's death in February, Ms Batty has used the media spotlight surrounding his murder to campaign against family violence.

Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Ken Lay said Ms Batty didn't want Luke's death to be wasted.

'She has put this very much on the community's agenda and all power to her for doing so. This system sometimes moves very slowly but I have no doubt at all that her courage and willingness to speak out will put us in a far better place,' he said.

The Victorian Government announced an additional $30 million to tackle family violence last week and Mr Lay said it was part of the 'Rosie Batty factor'.

Ms Batty had sought intervention orders against Luke's father after realising she was in a violent relationship.

In mid-2012, Anderson physically assaulted Ms Batty and in January last year he threatened to kill her and chop her foot off.

Anderson was only allowed to have contact with Luke at cricket and football training, which is where he subsequently attacked his son. He was fatally shot by police after he killing Luke.

'There has to be greater accountability with a breach of an intervention order,' Ms Batty said.

While Mr Lay said intervention orders mostly work, some people would not be bound by court orders.

'We see some tragic examples of that all too regularly and in the last few months we've seen a number so we just need to make sure that we have processes in place that can address those really high-risk people and I'm not sure we have that at the moment,' he said.
