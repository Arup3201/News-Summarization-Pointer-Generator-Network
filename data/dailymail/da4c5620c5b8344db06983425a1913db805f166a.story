Members of a historic gentlemen’s club are demanding it bans UKIP members after a ‘drunken’ fracas on its premises between Nigel Farage’s supporters after his TV debate with Nick Clegg. 

The incident reportedly occurred at the Reform Club in London’s Pall Mall – whose members include Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall – after the first TV debate with the Lib Dem leader last month. 

UKIP’s Michael Corby had hired a room for fellow party members to enjoy a live broadcast of the encounter.

Club members say there was ‘chaos’ when two guests had to be restrained by club officials when Mr Farage arrived at 10pm.

‘There was lots of screaming and shouting and liberal use of the f-word,’ said a peer who witnessed the fracas.

‘We simply do not tolerate that sort of thing.’

There is no suggestion Mr Corby was involved in any alleged misconduct.

A Reform Club spokesman said: ‘The club does not comment on its own affairs’.
