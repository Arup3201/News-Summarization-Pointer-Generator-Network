The number of Arsenal players injured on international duty is now up to four after Tomas Rosicky suffered a knock during the Czech Republic's Euro qualifier against Turkey on Friday night.

Rosicky, who missed his side's win over Kazakhstan on Monday, said: 'I couldn’t do any sharp movement, couldn’t sprint. If I tried to play in one tempo, I wouldn’t make any difference for the team.

'I’ll come back to London and we’ll see. The doctor said I have something swollen between the muscles.'

The 34-year-old midfielder is the latest Arsenal player to pick up an injury during the international break.

Mesut Ozil is set to be sidelined for three months after the midfielder suffered a knee ligament injury during training with Germany.

Meanwhile, Laurent Koscielny was forced home from France duty with tendinitis.

Danny Welbeck, signed from Manchester United in a £16million deal on transfer deadline day, sustained a slight knock after appearing to roll his ankle during England's 1-0 win over Estonia in Tallinn.

It is hoped the striker will return to Arsenal training on Wednesday.
