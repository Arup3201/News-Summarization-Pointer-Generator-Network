They are known for their unique sense of style when it comes to dressing for a day at the races. 

But now it appears that Liverpudlian girls are being handed some advice on dressing for Aintree. 

The famous racecourse has announced it will launch a 'Style Code' for next year's Ladies Day. 

Organisers of the Aintree races are set to introduce a Style Guide for the 2015 meet

Details of the dress code have not been revealed yet but organisers hope it will 'inspire and enthuse' visitors to make the event the most stylish to date.

They say it was inspired by the Coco Chanel quote: 'Dress shabbily and they remember the dress; dress impeccably and they remember the woman'.

A spokesman for the racecourse said: 'The overall consensus is that Ladies Day at The Grand National is a unique event bursting with personality and individual takes on style.

Aintree outfits have become shorter, flashier, and some might say tackier, in recent years 

'The forthcoming Style Code will aim to take this passion for fashion and hone in on ideas and tips on how to interpret style for the best results.' 

Aintree bosses deny they are trying to tell Liverpool ladies what not to wear. But they are going to use style 'ambassadors' to discuss how to dress for the big race.

The ambassadors will include Katie Walsh, the Grand National's most successful female jockey and face of Ladies Day 2015, and former amateur flat jockey and Channel 4 racing presenter Emma Spencer who will be leading various style discussions in the run-up to the event. 

Although it is not yet known what the new dress code will include, it is likely it will stipulate a skirt length 

Oragnisers said: 'The Style Code is fairly light-hearted but we want racegoers to really embrace it and cement The Crabbie's Grand National Ladies Day 2015 as the best dressed event in the racing calendar.' 

John Baker, regional director of the Jockey Club North West, which runs the racecourse, said: 'Ladies Day at The Grand National is always one of the most stylish and fabulous days in the racing calendar and we intend to continue encouraging this fantastic array of fashionistas into next year's festival.

'The Style Code is fairly light-hearted but we want racegoers to really embrace it and cement The Crabbie's Grand National Ladies Day 2015 as the best dressed event in the racing calendar.

'We look forward to seeing how men and women, both locally and all around the UK, celebrate their own incredible styles and enjoy this unique and thrilling three-day festival.'

The new dress code is said to be inspired by Coco Chanel quote: 'Dress shabbily and they remember the dress; dress impeccably and they remember the woman'
