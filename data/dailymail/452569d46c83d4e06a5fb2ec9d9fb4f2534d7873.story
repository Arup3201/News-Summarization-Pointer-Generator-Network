A Polish veterinary student who stitched the words 'I Love You' onto the skin of a dog and then posted the image on Facebook to impress his girlfriend is under investigation by university staff.

The fourth year student from the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn - a city in north east Poland - is believed to have been involved an operation on the dog, before using a large number of unnecessary stitches to spell out a message to his girlfriend on the animal's stomach.

The university opened an investigation into the incident after the student's friends reported him for 'grotesque' and 'unethical' behaviour.

'Grotesque': The Polish veterinary student stitched the words 'I Love You' onto the skin of a dog and then posted the image on Facebook in order to impress his girlfriend. He is under investigation by university staff

The student's message was written in English and required a large number of stitches - most of them totally unnecessary as the incision from the animal's operation was elsewhere on its stomach.

Having carried out the grisly task, the student took photographs of his message before posting them on Facebook and tagging his girlfriend.

Within minutes the couple's friends began criticising the photograph, branding the student unethical and describing the photograph as 'grotesque'.

One person quick to come to his defence, however, was the student's girlfriend, who asked: 'What's so unethical about it? He's learnt to sew in order to help and is just showing his skill.'

While the student's girlfriend may have been impressed, Andrzej Koncicki - head of veterinary studies at the University of Warmia and Mazury - is considerably less so.

He has now launched a full investigation into the incident, saying: 'We need to find out more about what happened here.'

'Saying you love someone is not a bad thing, but the fact that this was stitched into the stomach of an animal does seem immoral and unethical behaviour from a student of veterinary science,' he added.

'One of the first points of the Vets' Code of Ethics is that a vet practising his profession of public trust needs professional conduct and good morals,' Mr Koncicki went on to say.

The university offers a veterinary service for locals including some free treatments to allow students to test their skills under the watchful eye of a qualified professional. 

They are now trying to work out why the student's ill-advised joke was not stopped by his supervisor.
