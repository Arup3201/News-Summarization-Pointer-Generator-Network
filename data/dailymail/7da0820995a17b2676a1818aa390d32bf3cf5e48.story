Young mother Dawn Graves saved her baby by pushing his pram out of the path of a recycling lorry but was killed in the accident herself

A brave mother 'sacrificed her own life' to save her baby from being hit by a recycling truck, just weeks before she was due to marry her partner.

Dawn Graves, 25, pushed the pram, with her 20-month-old son Aidan, out of its path, but died after she was hit by the vehicle herself, an inquest has heard.

She suffered multiple injuries - described as 'unsurvivable' - as she crossed a street in the Breightmet area of Bolton, Greater Manchester, in May.

Deputy coroner Alan Walsh said that the mother-of-two gave no thought to the danger to herself as she pushed her son to safety.

Witness Thomas Grimshaw said he flagged down the lorry driver - who was unaware of the accident - and his partner, Rachel Bell, rushed to help stricken Miss Graves.

Miss Graves had been to a local shop and Miss Bell said she saw her with what appeared to be a bag of sweets.

Miss Bell told the inquest: 'She was just stepping off the pavement and she continued to walk.

'She was fiddling with what appeared to be some sweets as she pushed the pram.'

She said she saw Miss Graves push the pram out of the way and then saw her fall to the ground.

'It was all very quick,' she added.

When asked if she felt the driver could have avoided the accident Miss Bell said 'no'.

A distressed Mr Grimshaw said the vehicle was driving 'slowly' and he managed to get the driver’s attention who brought the lorry to a halt.

Mr Grimshaw said that the vehicle had been in full view.

Jordan Kay-Haworth, who was taking a break 
from work at a barber’s shop close to the scene, said that he saw the young mother leave 
the shop, look, then carry on walking and estimated the lorry speed as 
being either four or five miles an hour.

He said that she had 'momentarily looked down' but said he could not say 
for certain if a van parked outside the shop could have obstructed Miss 
Graves’ view of the lorry.

Lorry driver Eric Hamilton, who is not facing any charges following the accident, told the court he had done all required routine checks on his vehicle before leaving his Bury depot on the morning of May 24, including checks on the mirrors.

He had been heading home for a lunchtime sandwich when he stopped to allow a pedestrian, Isatu Jalloh, to cross in front of him, but he did not see Miss Graves.

'I was devastated,' said Mr Hamilton, who explained how Mr Grimshaw had flagged him down. 'My legs were like jelly and I had to sit down.'

Although a close proximity mirror on the vehicle was found to be incorrectly aligned, experts were unable to say if its correct position would have helped Mr Hamilton to see Miss Graves.

The court heard Miss Graves had been looking forward to her wedding to her partner, Barry Guest, in August.

She was also studying with the hope of getting a job.

Her mother, Audrey Ashmore, from Horwich, said her daughter had been more settled than she had ever been in her life.

Recording a verdict that Miss Graves’ death was a result of an accident, Mr Walsh said that she had 'sacrificed her own life for the benefit of her son' and recognised the terrible scene that had met the witnesses.

He said: 'I believe what happened was horrific for the witnesses. Dawn suffered unsurvivable injuries.'
