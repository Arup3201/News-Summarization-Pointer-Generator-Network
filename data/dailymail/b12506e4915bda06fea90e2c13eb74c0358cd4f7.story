A Costco employee allegedly kicked and broke a customer's leg at the store's exit.

Customer Timothy Walls alleges in his $670,000 lawsuit two Portland employees were involved in the altercation, The Oregonian reported.

Walls alleges his shopping wagon was yanked by one employee after he failed to present his Costco receipt which proved he spent approximately $103, in a suit obtained by the newspaper.

Incident: Timothy Walls claims he suffered a 'martial arts type strike' from an employee at this Portland Costco

Walls' suit says he then hauled the worker, holding on to the collar of his shirt, before suffering 'a martial arts type strike' from the second worker, The Oregonian reported.

The retail giant's policy says 'To ensure that all members are correctly charged for the merchandise purchased, all receipts and merchandise will be inspected as you leave the warehouse,' the newspaper pointed out. 

Costco and Walls have expressed a difference of opinion on where the event took place: the store said inside the store though Walls said it happened outside, according to The Oregonian.

Walls' attorney Clayton Morrison told the newspaper voided memberships are the solution to breaking Costco's aforementioned exit policy.

'The central issue in the case is... "What can Costco lawfully do? ...Can they actually stop you and take your property from you?" Our answer is "No,"' he said. 

Walls' 'own conduct, fault, and negligence' led to the wounds, a motion obtained by the newspaper from Costco attorney Bill Stockton said.

Requests for comment to both Morrison and Stockton from MailOnline were not immediately returned.
