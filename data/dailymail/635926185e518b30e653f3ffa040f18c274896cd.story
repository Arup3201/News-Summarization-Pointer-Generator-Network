Restrictions imposed on the movement of poultry after an outbreak of bird flu have now been lifted, the Government has said.

Some 6,000 ducks were culled on a farm at Nafferton, near Driffield, East Yorkshire, following the identification of 'highly pathogenic' H5N8 bird flu last month.

The disease was the same strain as one confirmed at a chicken farm in the central province of Utrecht, the Netherlands, and in Germany.

Around 6,000 were culled on a farm in East Yorkshire, after bird flu was discovered last month - today the government has announced that restrictions imposed on nearby poultry farms have finally been lifted

The farm is operated by the UK's largest producer of duck and duck products, Cherry Valley, which sells ready meals to Tesco, M&S, Lidl and Aldi. 

Most types of bird flu are harmless to humans but two types - H5N1 and H7N9 - have caused serious concerns. 

In a statement today, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Defra, said: 'On Sunday, December 21 all restrictions following the outbreak were lifted.

'This means that all poultry-keeping farms within the 10 kilometre (6.2 mile) surveillance zone around the infected property are now allowed to move poultry and other animals without restriction.

'Other restrictions covering the storage, transport and sourcing of meat products are also lifted.

'A protected zone which imposed additional movement controls on properties within three kilometres of the infected farm was lifted on Friday.'

Nigel Gibbens, chief vet for Defra, said: 'Protecting our country from animal diseases is important for our economy and our robust and thorough approach to tackling this outbreak means we are able to lift these restrictions at the earliest possible point allowed by EU law.

All poultry-keeping farms within the 10 kilometre  surveillance zone around the infected property were temporarily banned from moving their birds around

'This outbreak should serve as a reminder for the poultry industry of the importance of maintaining strict biosecurity to minimise the risk of infection and I would urge keepers to remain vigilant for any signs of disease and report suspicions to their vet immediately.

'Following confirmation of the outbreak last month, all poultry on the infected premises were humanely destroyed and the affected farm was cleansed and disinfected.

'The advice from Public Health England and the Chief Medical Officer is that the risk to public health is very low and the Food Standards Agency has said there is no food safety risk for consumers.

'Investigations are ongoing into the most likely source of the outbreak.'

The Yorkshire outbreak was the first serious case of bird flu in the UK since 2008 when the H7N7 strand was found in free range hens near Banbury, Oxfordshire.

 When the strain was confirmed emergency restrictions were immediately put in place on the movement of birds and eggs.

Defra carried out the cull on November 18 and began when a culling team dressed in chemical contamination suits marched into the first of six large barns.

They put batches of 80 ducks in large plastic crates that were loaded into a 20ft long chamber where they were gassed to death in around 15 minutes. 

The dead ducks were soaked in disinfectant and dumped inside a lorry to be transported for incineration.

At the time a Defra spokesman said the cull was being carried out in a ‘safe and humane manner’ by fully-trained staff from the Government’s Animal and Plant Health Agency. 

Officials are still investigating how the virus reached East Yorkshire. 

The European Commission said it is possible the virus is still being carried around Britain by migrating swans which are showing no signs of disease.

But environment secretary Liz Truss insisted there was no risk to human health - as the H5N1 strain which has killed 400 people globally was ruled out at an early stage.

Instead it is the H5N8 strain found in Germany and the Netherlands, which has never been known to cross over into humans. 

Cherry Valley has 33 British sites for breeding, hatching, growing or slaughtering 7million ducks a year, mostly in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire.

Bird flu - officially known as avian influenza - infects poultry around the world, often with no symptoms and no danger to people.

But some strains have been known to cross into humans with deadly results, notably with the H5N1 and H7N9 varieties.

The H5N1 strain first infected humans in Hong Kong in 1997 before re-emerging in 2003 and spreading from Asia to Europe and Africa.

Some 393 people have died from the strain since 2003 - more than half of the 667 who were infected.

Indonesia had by far the most deaths, followed by Vietnam and Egypt.

The H7N9 strain has caused particular concern since it emerged last year. 

It has not yet been reported outside China but the closure of live bird markets for several months as a precaution has devastated farmers.

The incubation period ranges from two to eight days and symptoms include a fever, cough, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal and pain and bleeding from the nose and gums.

Antiviral drugs can lessen the severity of the disease and help patients survive.

The biggest risk of catching bird flu is from direct contact with infected poultry, particularly carcasses. There is no evidence 'properly cooked food' can infect people with the virus.

The H5N8 strain, the one found in the Netherlands, Germany and Britain, has never been known to pass to humans.
