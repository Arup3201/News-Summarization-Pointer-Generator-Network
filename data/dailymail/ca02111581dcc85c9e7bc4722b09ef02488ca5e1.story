The mother of a British base jumper who fell to his death after clinging to a cliff for three hours said her son could have been saved if the emergency services had sent a helicopter.

Jake Simkins, 42, was left trapped on a rock face after his parachute became tangled while base-jumping on the Greek island of Zante.

The Londoner calmly chatted to his girlfriend, who was seven months pregnant, while waiting for rescuers to arrive, but was blown 180ft to his death by a gust of wind.

Terror: Jake Simkins is stuck up the cliff 180ft off the ground. He clung on desperately for three hours before falling to his death

Speaking for the first time since the 
tragedy, his mother Julia, 77, from Hampstead, London, said he could 
have been saved if the response team had dispatched a helicopter.

'If you are going to do an extreme 
sport like base jumping then make sure you go where you are rescuable,' 
she told the Evening Standard.

'That’s the awful thing, apparently he was rescuable, but they wouldn’t get the helicopter down to him.'

'From what we gather, the wind caught him on the rock face on his parachute and he phoned Anita (his girlfriend) to get help.

'He was there for three hours, they didn't get a helicopter. He was taken to the local hospital and pronounced dead.'

Mrs Simkins said her son, who worked 
for London Underground's engineering department, was 'very hardworking' 
and had a passion for extreme sports.

She said he had moved onto base jumping from skydiving about two years ago and had travelled around the world to do it.

He was in the process of buying a flat
with his partner Anita and she believed this was to be his last jump 
before they started a family together.

They were expecting their first child in September and were planning to get married.

Mrs Simkins added: 'This was their 
last holiday before the baby. He had already done three jumps and this 
was his last one before coming home.'

She said she went 'numb' when she 
found out about her son's death when two policemen knocked on her door 
in the middle of the night on Friday. She flew straight to the island to
be with Anita.

She said: 'We would like to thank 
everybody on the island, but we had a lot of problems with ambulance 
chasers who had falsified papers and tried to get hold of the body to 
get money out of us but that's all cleared up now.'

Her son's body is due to be returned 
to London tomorrow. There is no date yet for the funeral, but they are 
planning a natural burial in July.

Anthony Adams, Mr Simkins' neighbour 
at his Wood Green house for 13 years, today told the Standard: 'He was 
outdoorsy, but not the kind of guy who would go for a two-day walk along
the Devonshire coast.

'He was a real thrill-seeker, you could spot it a mile off. His death is such a shock. It’s a great shame.'

Failure: Greek emergency services were unable to rescue the London Underground worker, who fell onto Navagio beach on Zante after a gust of wind dragged his parachute off the cliff. Pictured is another base jumper in action

Mr Simkins had been practising base 
jumping, in which parachutists jump from cliffs, bridges or buildings. 
The pursuit is regarded as one of the most dangerous sports in the 
world.

Mr Adams added: 'Most weekends he 
would be off base jumping somewhere, he did it a lot. He was also into 
parachuting and sky-driving. I didn’t actually see him at home that 
much. He was really bubbly and outgoing, a very friendly guy.'

As he dangled hundreds of feet above 
the rocks on the island – also known as Zakynthos – Mr Simkins made 
calls from his mobile to reassure partner Anita that he was not badly 
hurt after hitting the cliff and had only injured his leg.

A Greek worker who was alongside Anita contacted the emergency services, but fire crews failed to reach Mr Simkins.

The woman, who did not want to be named, said: ‘He was speaking to her constantly and letting her know he was okay.

‘He was calm, and they were even joking. Jake asked for the emergency services to throw him a rope, so he could climb down.

‘Surely three hours was enough time for the fire service to find a rope and get it to him?’

Antonis Potamitis, who runs tour 
boats to the bay and had collected Mr Simkins following other jumps, 
said he had repeatedly called the fire service and begged them to bring a
specialist climbing team from Athens.

He added: ‘It was a terrible tragedy. Jake was a really good man, and knew what he was doing, but somehow ended up on the rocks.

‘I asked the local fire chief to call for specialist back up, but he wouldn’t listen.

‘And even though three hours passed 
and he was hanging 70 metres above the rocks, they didn’t even get a 
rope down. How is that possible?’

Mr Simkins was pronounced dead after 
his fall on Friday evening. His partner was taken to hospital suffering 
from shock, although she was discharged on Sunday and his since flown 
back to Britain.

The pair were hoping to get married following the birth of their child.

A local on the island said: ‘She was 
in complete shock. She could hardly speak for the  first day. But then 
it is to be expected. She came on holiday with her partner, and she left
without him.’

Mr Simkins’ partner was too upset to speak yesterday when she answered the door of his family home in north London.

Friends said Mr Simkins, who worked 
as a signal technician for London Underground, was an experienced 
base-jumper who had undertaken more than 40 solo jumps.

He had also parachuted down to Navagio beach – known as ‘shipwreck bay – on three occasions before his fatal fall.

Base-jumping is an extreme sport in 
which participants leap from a fixed point before using a parachute at 
the last minute to break their fall.

The word ‘base’ is an acronym of the 
four points from which they can leap: buildings, antennas, spans 
(bridges) and earth (cliffs).

A spokesman for the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office said: ‘We can confirm the death of a British 
national on June 8 in Greece. We are providing consular assistance to 
the family.’
