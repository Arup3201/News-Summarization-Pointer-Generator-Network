Nabbed!: Kenneth Conley, 38, broke out of a federal jail in downtown Chicago on Dec. 18 with his cellmate

The second convicted bank robber who absconded from a federal jail in downtown Chicago last month was collared Friday donning a disguise making him up to look like an elderly man.

However, even elaborately disguised, Kenneth Conley, 38, apparently didn't get very far in the time since he hightailed it from the Metropolitan Correctional Center Dec. 18.

The bank robber was nabbed around 4pm in southwest suburban Palos Hills — at a location The Chicago Sun Times reports is less than 100 yards from where he once lived a decade ago.

When caught, Conley was masquerading as an old man in a costume complete with sunglasses, a beret, an overcoat, the aforementioned cane, Palos Hills Deputy Police Chief James Boi told The Sun-Times.

Meanwhile, the escape accomplice with whom Conley fled - Jose Bank - was bagged Dec. 20 in Lincoln Park, a Chicago suburb where he too once lived.

Man of Many Faces: When he robbed a bank in 2011, Conley wore a suit and tie...and a gun tucked into his pants' waistband

It's possible the larcenous Conley swiped a page from Bank in going about town in a costume.

The Sun-Times reports Bank had been popularly dubbed 'The Second-Hand Bandit' during his profligate run, a moniker he earned from the thrift store disguises he donned during his heists.

Conley's arrest came through the assistance of both a tipster - as well as a Palos Hills homeowner who reportedly popped Conley in the kisser while he attempted to flee from police.

The capture is reportedly rooted in a tip from two maintenance workers concerning an apparent drifter snoozing in the basement of a Palos Hills condo building undergoing renovation.

Two responding officers, in short order, discovered the elusive Conley, who after giving them a phony pseudonym  again tried to escape by scuffling with both lawmen and punching one.

But he didn't get very far.

Jailbreak: Conley was nabbed in a Chicago suburb only about 20 miles from the federal lock-up he escaped on Dec. 18

Conley tried to bust into the wrong man's home about 3.40pm - or one in which reportedly resides a hulking 6-foot, 7-inch, 33-year-old high school teacher who would only identify himself as 'Dan.'

Dan told The Sun Times he lives with his four young children, one of whom he was playing with when Conley half-way opened his screen door and tried slip inside - and away from police.

'I was like ‘I don’t think you’re getting in here at all,’ Dan told the paper, before adding that he first hammered Conley in the shoulder - and then punched square in the face, causing the beleaguered bank robber to stumble backwards on to a grassy yard - and into the custody of police.

Busted: Joseph Banks, who is also a convicted bank robber, was nabbed Dec. 20, or two days after the escape in the Chicago suburb of Lincoln

'Where he met his end was here,' Dan reportedly said. 'He didn’t get permission to enter my place. He got taken out of here in a bad way.'

Police report that they later found a BB gun in Conley's pocket but no ID or money. He was taken to Palos Community Hospital for a checkup alongside the two officers who both suffered minor injuries in the arrest.

Conley and his cellmate, Banks, escaped their lockup by apparently smashing a hole in their narrow cell window and climbing down 20 stories using a rope fashioned from bed sheets.

Conley pleaded guilty in October to robbing a Homewood Bank in 2011 of nearly $4,000. He wore a coat and tie during the robbery and had a gun stuffed in his waistband. Although he is yet to be sentenced on that charge, he faces up to 20 years in prison on the bank robbery wrap.

Shackled in chains and pushed in a wheelchair by U.S. marshals, Conley was hauled back into federal court on Saturday.

A largely silent Conley wore a medical brace on a badly swollen left foot, apparently injured during his capture.

When Conley did speak during it was simply to acknowledge he understood he could face an additional five years behind bars if convicted in the escape.

'Yes, your honor,' the 38-year-old former strip club worker said, according to the Chicago Sun-Times
