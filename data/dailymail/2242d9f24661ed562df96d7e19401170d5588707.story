This treetop hotel lets you live like a bird in a 'nest' made of bamboo.

The ecologically sensitive concept is inspired by nests and the tipis of Native Americans and sees sleeping pods nestled among the forest canopy.

Chinese architecture company Penda say the flexible design can be adapted to different surroundings and create a ‘comfortable atmosphere in a unique environment.’

Using bamboo connected together with ropes, a structural grid allows ‘triangulated pots’ to be created, with size depending on intended usage.

Sleeping areas can be different sizes, with larger pods for families, while there is scope for connected pots for larger functions such as a hotel lobby or restaurant and pods for a bathroom or toilet.

The temporary nature of the structure also means it can be removed when not needed with no impact on the natural environment.

Calming: Get close to nature by living among the trees in tipis made out of bamboo complete with their own spacious balconies

Penda, who created the concept for the AIM 'legend of tent' competition say: ‘The structure is inspired by the tipis of native Americans, which didn’t leave any harm on the site, nor on the material itself, because the joints were connected with ropes, so the tents were easy to construct, deconstruct and carried. A truly flexible system.

‘We see the structure not just as an element which inhabits typical functions of a hotel and is connected to nature, we also see it as an element, where nature can be implemented and after a certain time, those plants can grow take over the whole structure.

‘This feeling of leaving city-life behind and getting connected to nature and experiencing our natural environment is the driving idea of our proposal’.
