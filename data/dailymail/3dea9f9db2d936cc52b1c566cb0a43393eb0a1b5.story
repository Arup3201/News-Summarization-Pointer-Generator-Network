More agony: Photos of the  victim of Ched Evans (pictured) have been posted online, say reports

Photos of Ched Evans'  rape victim have resurfaced online and been viewed thousands of times, it was claimed today.

The revelation is a fresh trauma for the woman, who has already been in hiding for more than two years after she was raped by the former footballer in a hotel room in 2012.

Despite Evans being convicted, supporters who believe he was innocent have repeatedly heaped abuse on the victim - with some even breaking the law to name her online.

Now it has emerged two photos of the woman were posted on an Asian news website, according to an investigation by Simon Wright for the Sunday People.

The newspaper claimed it was not necessary to have the woman's name to find the images, and the web page hosting them was viewed thousands of times. 

Rape victims are entitled to lifelong anonymity, which is lifted only if they choose to waive it themselves or are prosecuted for perjury or perverting the course of justice.

Those who break the law by circulating a rape victim's name can be fined up to £5,000 each, whether or not they claimed to know it was illegal.

Jill Saward, a campaigner who waived her right to anonymity after being brutally gang-raped in 1986, told the newspaper the pictures' emergence was 'scandalous'.

'This callous irresponsibility is being fuelled by people who did not like the outcome of the case', she said.

'She has already undergone a traumatic experience but her nightmare shows no sign of ending'.

Evans, who had a  girlfriend of two years, had been on a Sunday night out in his home town of Rhyl when the rape took place in 2012.

The victim, then just a teenager, had been on a night out which involved drinking at least two large glasses of red wine, four double vodkas and a shot of Sambuca.

Maintaining his innocence: Evans, pictured with fiancée Natasha Massey, is still challenging the case. Vile trolls have heaped abuse on his victim from the 2012 rape, breaking the law to name her

CCTV from a nearby fast food shop showed her staggering and losing her balance, falling into a wall, before she ended up being taken back to Evans' hotel room. 

Nine trolls of the victim were fined £624 each in 2012 for naming his victim online - causing her to leave her home town and adopt a new identity.

The former footballer has always insisted he is innocent and is backed by a well-funded campaign to clear his name. He  plans to challenge his conviction with the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

That  led vengeful supporters to brand his distraught victim a 'dirty little money-grabber', and a 'dirty slut who brought the situation on herself' and 'deserved much worse'.

The comments prompted outrage by anti-rape campaigners who said the victim was being blamed for something that was not in any way her fault.

All smiles: Now released from jail, Evans is resuming his life - but his victim from 2012 is still in hiding

This week the Ched Evans case was once again making headlines over guidelines which would see men accused of date rape being asked to prove that a woman wanted to have sex.

Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said it was vital to remove ‘any grey area’ to recognise situations where a woman may have been unable to give consent.

Campaigners described the move as a ‘huge step forward’ in ensuring fewer rapists escaped justice, though critics said it could threaten the presumption of innocence.

Evans, meanwhile, has said he is determined to return to football.

Outrage over his potential to set a bad example to children has stopped that from happening so far, with potential signings to Oldham and Sheffield being thwarted.
