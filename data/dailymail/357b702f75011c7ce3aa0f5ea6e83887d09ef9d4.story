Suing: Romilda Aparecida Ferreira says she needs money to cover the her medical expenses and make up for the time at work she missed

A Brazilian prostitute who says she was thrown out of a US Embassy car by three Marines and run over is suing the American government, it emerged Thursday.

The US State Department is fighting back now, saying Romilda Aparecida Ferreira was not pushed, but was instead hit when she tried to get inside the vehicle and the driver sped away.

The lawsuit Miss Ferreira, 31, is promising is just the latest South American sex worker scandal to embarrass government employees working overseas.Â 

Earlier this month, 24 Secret Service
agents and military servicemen were suspended after they allegedly 
partied with Colombian prostitutes ahead of President Barack Obama's 
visit to the country.

It
was also revealed Secret Service agents in El Salvador allegedly 
partied with strippers and took hookers back to their hotel before 
Obama's visit there in 2011.

Miss
Ferreira was left with a broken collar bone, two broken ribs and a 
punctured lung after the incident in Brazil's capital Brasilia in 
November.

The three Marines
on a US Embassy security team, and an Embassy staff member, were pulled
out of the country before police were able to press charges, according 
to Brazil's Jornal Nacional programme.

The US government says it tracked Miss Ferreira down and paid her medical expenses.

However, she says she was offered just $2,100 -- never nearly enough to cover the cost of surgeries and 12 days in the hospital.

It cost more than $9,500 for just the operation to fix her collarbone, which was botched.

In her lawsuit, she is seeking money for her injuries, medical expenses, lost income, and psychological trauma.

According to a Brazilian police 
investigation, the four US Embassy officials had visited a nightclub 
in the centre of Brasilia where they had hired a group of prostitutes.

One of the Americans and at least one 
woman left the club by taxi, but Miss Ferreira and another women got into 
an official US Embassy van with the other three men.

As
they pulled away there was a discussion about how much the women were 
to be paid, and one of the Marines pushed Miss Ferreira out of the car, 
where she ended up being run over by the vehicle.

Pittance: Miss Ferreira says US officials offered her just $2,100 for her injuries, but her 12-day hospital stay and surgery cost much more

Speaking to the Jornal Nacional news programme, Romilda said she tried to hold on to the door but was dragged under the wheels.

She said: 'I tried to get up and 
grabbed the doorknob. That was when they told the driver to go. Then I 
felt my leg burning. I let go and fell underneath the van. I hit my head
and passed out.'

The Americans then allegedly drove away without offering assistance.

But a State Department account of the events contradicts key parts of Miss Ferreira's story.

The department said Miss Ferreira tried to open a door and climb into the moving car. Spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the woman fell and was injured. She said no charges were filed against the four Americans but all have left Brazil.

The incident came to light after US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta was questioned about it by a Brazilian reporter during a press conference

A defense official said Tuesday there were two women with the Marines outside of the club and that it appeared one of women started a fight inside the car. She was removed from the vehicle and fell when she tried to get back in, according to the official. A second official said the woman broke her collarbone when she was pushed from the car.

This incident came to light after US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, in Brazil during a Latin American tour, was questioned about it by a Brazilian reporter during a press conference.

Police
investigating the incident requested the arrest of the driver of the 
van and one of the Marines for bodily injury and failure to rescue.

But US authorities removed the four men from the country before they could be charged with the crimes.

Speaking to reporters in Brasilia, Mr Panetta said the men were pulled from the country, two of the Marines had their ranks reduced and the embassy staff member was removed from his post.

He added that the embassy had tracked Miss Ferreira down and paid for her medical expenses.

He added: 'This incident was fully investigated and all those involved were punished. They are no longer in this country. This type of behaviour is unacceptable.'

He said he had 'no tolerance for that kind of conduct. Where it takes place you can be sure that we will act to make sure that they are punished.'

Miss Ferreira, who is still recovering from her injuries, said she now intends to sue the American embassy.
