Authorities in Ohio say a man suspected of killing his on-and-off girlfriend during a vacation to North Carolina's Outer Banks is in custody after a month-long nationwide manhunt.

The U.S. Marshals Service announced today that Nathan Summerfield was under arrest. He was apprehended in a motel in Medina County where he was staying under a fictitious name and had grown a beard.

Summerfield was wanted on a murder charge in the death of 33-year-old Lynn Jackenheimer of Ashland, Ohio. She disappeared in July while vacationing with Summerfield and her children.

U.S. Marshall's in Ohio say Nathan Summerfield, who is suspected of killing his on-and-off girlfriend, Lynn Jackenheimer during a vacation to North Carolina's Outer Banks is in custody after a month-long nationwide manhunt

Her body was found in a vacant lot in Frisco, North Carolina, about 20 to 30 miles from where she'd been vacationing.

Authorities finally caught up with Summerfield almost a month to the date that a warrant was issued for his 
arrest.

Nate Summerfield was said to have gone on the run in July after returning the children and telling his brother he strangled his wife.

Investigators say she died from strangulation and stab wounds.

Her body was found in a bag by a construction 
worker about 30 minutes from where she was last seen.

Authorities said the warrant 
for Summerfield was issued once the body was identified. He previously 
was described as a 'person of interest' in the case.

Before the vacation, Lynn 
Jackenheimer had told family and friends that she was 'hesitant' about 
taking the trip with her former partner because he had been violent in 
the past.

After she 
vanished around six weeks weeks ago, police began to hunt around Hatteras 
Island in North Carolina, where the pair had been vacationing with her 
two children.

A construction worker saw
something suspicious and upon investigating realized that it was a dead
body.

Alex Taylor, a friend of the missing woman from Ashland, Ohio, told Fox: 'I do know at one point she told Nate she was thinking about not going.

'If I really thought she was in danger, we wouldnâ€™t have let her go.'

Summerfield, 27, allegedly returned after murdering his ex-girlfriend to drop off Ms Jackenheimer's 13-year-old daughter and the young boy to their grandparents' homes before fleeing in his car.

His brother Jake immediately called 911 to report 'a possible murder'.

'My brother was in North Carolina with 
his ex-girlfriend and he came back and said he strangled her. He dropped
his kid off and left,' Jake Summerfield told a dispatcher.

He added that he did not know where his brother was going when he sped away in his grey 2009 Honda Civic.

Police were hunting Summerfield using his cell phone signal and when his ATM card was used.

They searched the homes of Ms Jackenheimer and Summerfield for clues.

Ms Jackenheimer had been staying in
a vacation rental home on the island with Summerfield and her children,
but authorities found no clues as to her whereabouts at the home.

'We found nothing to date that they sent us to look for,' Dare County Sheriff's Department Chief Deputy Steve Hoggard.

The children remain with relatives in
Ohio. Both had been questioned by police but could offer little evidence about what had happened to their mother.

Lynn's stepfather, Raymond Johnson, told WOIO that Ms Jackenheimer's 13-year-old daughter, who has special needs, was left at his home in Dorchester, Ohio.

'She was all by herself when we found her,' Mr Johnson said. 'He left her in the house took the little boy to his parents' house.

'They mainly cry for their mom, that's what they are doing. We are hoping for the best that's all.'
