Estranged: The couple met in 1992 and married in 2000, but are now separated

The estranged wife of celebrity chef Marco Pierre White has been charged with vandalising his car with a child's scooter.

Mati Conejero, 47, is accused of damaging the chef's Range Rover while it was parked outside his flat in West London.

The incident is alleged to have happened in May.

Conejero has pleaded not guilty to criminal damage and is due to appear before Isleworth Crown Court in October.

Mr White, 50, who has an estimated fortune of £25million, met Conejero in 1992 and they married in 2000.

They began divorce proceedings in 2007, but halted them last year after running up legal bills totalling an estimated £3million.

Conejero lives in a flat above a pizza restaurant once owned by Mr White, in Chiswick, West London.

Mr White resides in a £2.5million flat in Holland Park, West London.

Details of Conejero's court appearance have emerged less than three weeks after Mr White was seen dining with actress Emilia Fox in a restaurant.

‘They were canoodling,’ said an onlooker at Carluccio’s in Chiswick, West London.

‘They were holding hands and kissing. Marco was caressing her face and they were feeding each other food.

‘They looked like a couple who had just found their first love.

'They were like a pair of 18-year-olds.’

Mr White left school in Leeds without any qualifications, but has gone on to become a television star.

He began his training in kitchens in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, and Ilkley, West Yorkshire, before moving to London as a 16-year-old.

At 24, he became head chef and joint owner of Harveys with a kitchen staff that included Gordon Ramsay and Heston Blumenthal.

By the age of 33, Mr White had become the youngest chef to be awarded three Michelin stars.

He was the head chef in ITV television series Hell's Kitchen.
