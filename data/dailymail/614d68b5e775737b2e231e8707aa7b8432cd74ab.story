These cramped flats expose the extreme lengths Londoners will go to for a room of one's own.

All of the boltholes were advertised in the last fortnight in the capital, which is caught in the centre of an explosion in the housing market - with some of the studios pictured costing more than £1,000 a month.

Last week a London council banned a landlord from letting out a studio flat so small that its bed blocked a kitchen cupboard, despite a tenant agreeing to rent it for £737 a month in less than 16 hours.

Room with a stew: There was an outcry after this flat - so small the bed blocks a kitchen cupboard - was let for £737 a month. But it is not the only 'shoebox' in London

Fancy breakfast in bed? The tenant of this flat in Hammersmith, west London, would only have to take two steps to the hob - for the princely sum of £563 a month

Cosy: This flat is £542 a month in Kilburn, north west London. New build British homes are the smallest in western Europe, the Royal Institute of British Architects says

Council officers investigated after the listing in Islington, north London, was plastered over social media and attracted the attention of the press, and found it could not be rented in its current state.

Cllr James Murray, the council's executive member for housing, said: 'This place is a shoebox, not a flat, so we're serving a prohibition order to stop it being rented out again.'

But the flat was not the only one with an ultra-quick route to breakfast in bed.

Thousands of studio flats are advertised in the capital, many of them costing more than entire homes in the north of England. Often grand Victorian or Edwardian townhouses are split into several shoebox dwellings on each floor, each with a tiny kitchen and shower.

The huge furore on social media over the Islington flat has not put off potential landlords. Since then, another studio has come on the market a few streets away for £1,083 per month.

It boasts a sleek, modern design - but the kitchen sink is also reachable from the end of the bed.

Sleek: This north London flat's modern design will make it far more appealing, but it comes at a cost - £1,083 per month - and the kitchen is still shaped around the bed

Convenient: The shower of this £542-a-month flat in Hammersmith, west London, is inside the bedroom, though the toilet (shared with one other person) is mercifully not

Snug: This flat costs £780 a month in the exclusive west London enclave of Chelsea. Location is everything, as it has two hobs and the kitchen and bed almost touch

Elsewhere a flat is advertised for £780 a month in the exclusive west London enclave of Chelsea - but its occupant shouldn't have too exclusive a taste in cooking, as it has two electric hobs squeezed onto a kitchen counter which ends about 1ft from the bed.

One of the biggest problems is storage space. One flat in Harringey, north London, solves that by having its occupant climb a ladder to reach their mattress. But its price - at £607 a month, comparatively low for the capital - is still more than an average three-bedroom flat in Liverpool.

Britain now has the smallest new flats in western Europe, according to the Royal Institute of British Architects.

It launched a campaign last year calling for an end to 'rabbit hutch Britain' and saying the average new one-bedroom flat is now smaller than a Tube carriage.

But as a carriage on the Jubilee line is a princely 495 square feet, most of those pictured in this article are likely to be far smaller than that. And that size is still 100 square feet larger than the minimum size of a one-bed flat recommended by the Greater London Authority.

Grand Designs presenter Kevin McCloud fronted the campaign, saying: 'This isn't rocket science. We all instinctively respond to the opportunity for a view, a connection with the outdoors, fresh air, light and space.

'A return to minimum space standards is crucial for the health and wellbeing of the people who will be living in new build homes.'

Lofty: Numbering at least six steps - or one giant leap - the occupant of this £607-a-month flat in Harringey, north London, would face a long walk to the fridge

Space: A £628-a-month studio in Shepherd's Bush, west London. House prices in the capital are now almost 25 per cent more than in their pre-recession peak

This flat in Paddington, west London, will set you back an eye-watering £1,257 a month - despite being just big enough to sleep, eat and cook with few feet to spare

But Mr McCloud's comments, almost a year ago, came before yet another surge in London house prices.

Last week it was revealed homes in the capital are selling for almost 25 per cent more than in their peak before the recession - and more than double the average in the rest of the country.

The Office for National Statistics said a
 typical home in the capital is worth £459,000, 24.8 per cent more than
 in January 2008.

'London’s renters are 
getting a raw deal with flats that are costly, cramped and 
claustrophobic'

- Roger Harding, Shelter

It is not only flats that are up for grabs. In April a ramshackle building next to an industrial estate in south London, whose most prominent use was to park the Mayor of Southwark's car, sold at auction for £550,000 after a bidding war - three times its estimate.

Parking spaces have also boomed in price, with a single space offered in a car park under the Royal Albert Hall in Kensington, west London, for £400,000.

The huge increases have sparked fears of a bubble limited entirely to the capital. Prices across the rest of the UK are
 still 2.4 per cent lower than they were before the financial crisis, at £195,000.

Roger Harding, campaigns director for the homeless charity Shelter,
 told MailOnline: 'This is further proof that London’s renters are 
getting a raw deal with flats that are costly, cramped and 
claustrophobic.

'The 
huge cost of private rents in the capital and tough competition for 
homes means that many renters have no choice but to take the first place
 they can afford, whether they are in poor condition or far too small 
for them and their families.

'The
 Mayor needs to get serious about building the affordable homes we 
desperately need, or times will keep getting tougher for generation 
rent.'
