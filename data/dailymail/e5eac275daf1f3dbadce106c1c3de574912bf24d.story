Former Arsenal captain Thierry Henry has got fans guessing after posting picture of himself alongside singer-songwriter Robbie Williams on Twitter, cryptically promising 'something special' ahead of Red Nose Day 2015. 

The biennial television charity appeal, which is part of the wider Comic Relief campaign, is set to air this year on March 13. 

Williams, who has had UK No 1 singles with Millennium and Rock DJ, has taken part in previous Red Nose Day shows, and famously appeared dressed as a woman with Matt Lucas and David Walliams of the hit comedy series Little Britain in 2009.

It remains to be seen whether Henry, who retired from playing football last year, will be prepared to try something as daring.    

Since hanging up his boots, Arsenal's all-time leading goalscorer, has been working as a pundit for Sky Sports and taking the first steps into coaching, juggling a part-time role with the north London club's youth development teams.

Henry is known to support a number of humanitarian causes and is an ambassador for the children's charity, UNICEF.
