A married insurance agent accused of helping a Zumba instructor use her fitness studio as a front for prostitution was convicted Wednesday in a case that set off a guessing game in a small Maine town over who was on her customer list.

Mark Strong Sr. controlled, supervised and managed the prostitution business and watched the sex acts live via Skype from his office 100 miles away, prosecutors contend.

The married businessman acknowledged having an affair with dance instructor Alexis Wright and helping her open the Kennebunk studio but contended he didn't profit from her prostitution.

Guilty: Jurors have found Mark Strong (right) guilty of 12 counts of promoting prostitution and one of conspiracy

Wright is scheduled to stand trial in May, barring a settlement.

Deputy District Attorney Justina McGettigan said the guilty verdicts vindicated law enforcement officials accused of putting too much time and money into the investigation.

'Prostitution is not legal in Maine. We don't promote prostitution. We don't want it in our communities,' she said.

'The Kennebunk Police Department did a fabulous job investigating this despite all of the negative comments that were thrown out that it was a poor use of resources. In fact, it was a good use of resources because it makes our communities safer.'

Jurors deliberated for 4 1/2 hours before announcing that they had found Strong guilty of all 13 counts - 12 of promoting prostitution and one of conspiracy.

Pending: Wright is awaiting trial. She has pleaded not guilty to all charges

Strong, 57, of Thomaston, showed little reaction as the verdicts were announced. His wife buried her head in their son's shoulder and quietly sobbed.

Later, Strong said his family needs to heal. 'It's not easy obviously,' Strong told reporters outside the courthouse. 'It's going to take time.'

Strong, who was released on personal recognizance, is due to be sentenced on March 19.

Theoretically, he could be sentenced to up to 13 years in prison for the 13 misdemeanor counts but consecutive sentences are unlikely, especially since he had no criminal record, attorneys said.

Defense lawyer Dan Lilley said he was disappointed by the verdict but is now focusing on sentencing and possible appeals.

'I never argue with a jury. It's a useless exercise. We're going to look over the options we have now,' he told a throng of reporters gathered outside the courthouse.

He said he anticipated a sentence ranging from a fine to 'weeks and perhaps months incarceration.'

The scandal in Kennebunk, a village known more for its sea captains' homes and beaches than crime, attracted international attention in the fall after it was reported that Wright's ledgers indicated she had more than 150 clients and made $150,000 over 18 months.

Authorities then sent the town abuzz with word that they would be charging each of the johns, leading residents to wonder who they were. Residents, though, soon grew weary of the media attention.

Testimony and videos presented to jurors indicated Strong was familiar with operational details of Wright's activities, chatting via Skype before and after her appointments and watching the sexual encounters from his office in Thomaston.

Before each tryst, Wright took time to make sure her video camera was hidden and pointed at the massage table where the encounters took place.

The judge previously dismissed 46 invasion-of-privacy counts that stemmed from videotaping of prostitution clients without their knowledge.

Even as lurid details emerged in the 
courtroom, Strong's wife of 30 years and several other family members 
remained seated several rows behind him.

The
verdict in the delay-plagued trial came more than six weeks after the 
start of jury selection, which was halted twice because of legal action 
that went to the state supreme court, leaving potential jurors in limbo 
for weeks.

Jurors left without talking to reporters.

One
thing that was missing from the trial was testimony from Wright's 
accused clients. Eighteen of them were on the state's list of witnesses,
but none of them testified after attorneys stipulated that the 
encounters took place.

As
for Wright, her attorney and prosecutors will hold a settlement 
conference next week, McGettigan said. Barring a settlement, Wright is 
scheduled to stand trial in May on more than 100 counts that include 
prostitution and tax violations.

Sarah Churchill, Wright's lawyer, said the issues are different with her case. She declined to comment on settlement talks.

Earlier in the trial police officer Audra Presby has testified that she had found an 'assortment of condoms', four bottles of baby oil, cameras, a planner and $1,000 cash at Wright's residence.

Presby was assigned to the case in October 2011
following a complaint of suspicious activity at Wright's Pura Vida Zumba 
studio.

While Presby 
initially failed to make any discoveries of suspicious activity, she 
carried out internet searches and came across a blog that caught her 
attention.

'When I performed the online search, 
not only did I find this site, Sensual Body Works by Lydia, I also found... online sex videos of this individual,' Presby said.

Another
agent called the number listed on the blog and posed as a client to ask
whether an hour massage would get him sex. On the tape, which was 
played in the court, she responds: 'OK.'

Presby testified she had also seized several 
computer hard drives, a laptop, checkbooks and personal lubricants from Wright's businesses, home and vehicle during a February 2012 search.

Presby also testified that she linked Strong to the case after seeing a sex
video of him and Wright and matching his face and voice to the video appearances.

Strong 
watched sexual encounters between Wright and her clients through a live computer webcam and 
spoke with Wright when the men were out of the 
room.

'I remember keeping the logs of the hours [spent watching sexually 
explicit evidence],' Presby said. 'I know at one point I was well over 80 hours, and by the 
end, I was closer to 120 hours.'

Wright, a 30-year-old single mother, is slated to stand trial in May. She has pleaded not guilty to all charges

Jurors were shown a video of Wright having sex with a 61-year-old man on
a massage table in exchange for $250, while Strong watched 
from his home computer via Skype.

The damning evidence, recorded by 
Wright herself on a camera hidden in a nest of lingerie, shows her 
negotiating a fee and then collecting a pile of cash after she finishes.

Prosecutors
argued that Strong was listening in and watching live via Skype during 
the entire encounter and later discussed booking other johns for Wright -
pushing her to sleep with three clients in one day instead of two.

In between clients, she discussed her
schedule of clients with a man watching through the video 
camera. Prosecutors say that man is Strong.

'I'd like to schedule only two one-hour appointments tomorrow instead of 45,' Wright says, talking to the camera.

'Nice to get three in somehow,' the man's voice says.

When Wright says that she has 'school' the next day, the man suggests she 'fit three in today.'

Wright says that would be 'pushing it.'

The man's voice later asks which clients he should try to book for her.

The time stamp on the 36-minute video
shown the jurors, which was seized from Wright's home, corresponds with
the time on 45 Skype video screen shots that were downloaded from Strong's computer, an investigator testified.

In other videos, the pair discuss rates and sexual services that Wright offered.
