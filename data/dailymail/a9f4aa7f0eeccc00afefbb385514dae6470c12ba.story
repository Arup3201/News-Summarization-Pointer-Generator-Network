A New Jersey inmate on a staggering year-long hunger strike has refused all solid food since March 2012 and lost almost half his body weight as a result claiming 'After a while, you're not hungry anymore.'

William Lecuyer, 34, began his protest after his sentence was extended over what he says was a misunderstanding over a drugs test and now has left him on the brink of death.

Surviving only on his daily coffee and cream and a nutritional drink once a week, Lecuyer weighed 230 pounds at the start of his strike but now is a skeletal 120 pounds.

Five months into his abstinence, New Jersey State Prison officials in Trenton were so fearful Lecuyer would die they went to court to get an order to force-feed him and end his hunger strike.

'If medical staff cannot immediately perform these measures over his objections,' the state argued unsuccessfully on July 10 reported NJ.Com, 'he will suffer irreversible organ damage sometime in the next few days and eventually die.'

The courts sided with Lecuyer, saying he had a First Amendment right to refuse to eat and eight-months on Lecuyer clings to life.

The Attorney General's Office in New Jersey said that no one can ever recall a protest of this length, nor the state attempting to go to court to save the life of an inmate who refused food.

William Lecuyer has been held in solitary confinement in New Jersey for the duration of his year-long hunger strike

Lecuyer's lawyer, Jean Ross, said that currently his lips have turned gray, he has significant difficulties concentrating and has developed breathing difficulties because his diaphragm is collapsing.

The dispute centers around Lecuyer's desire to see a prison log book he claims will prove he didn't break prison regulations two-years-ago, which led to him receiving a sentence of four-months of solitary confinement.

Currently the convicted bank robber has four more years left on his sentence and the state fears if it gives into his request other prisoners will see it as a precedent.

'The prison administration cannot allow itself to be coerced by an inmate,' said Martin Horn, former New York City corrections commissioner and secretary of commissions in Pennsylvania,.

'The point of prison is, when you’ve exhausted your legal options and you don’t get what you want, you have to do what you’re told.'

However, according to Lecuyer, 18-months ago a prison drug dog detected something in his cell on June 14th 2011 and he was asked to submit a urine test - something which he and the Department of Corrections both agree on.

Lecuyer, claims though, that he was made to wait for more than two hours and had to urinate and when the guard finally requested a sample he was unable to do so.

The former high-school footballer said that the guard agreed to give him more time but later changed his mind and charged Lecuyer with failing to give a sample.

Lecuyer says the log book will prove he was made to wait for more than two hours and that no drugs were found in his cell either.

'After a while, you’re not hungry anymore,' Lecuyer said last week in a phone interview with NJ.Com. 'I don’t want to die, but I’m not afraid of it.'

His lawyer, Ross, has pleaded with the state including Corrections Commissioner Gary Lanigan and Governor Chris Christie to make an exception.

'They say they would be setting a precedent for other prisoners. But at this point, it wouldn’t be setting any kind of precedent — at this point, it would be saving a life,' said Ross.

Lecuyer has spent nearly half his life in and out of prisons and was first arrest for robbing a gas station in 1998 with an unloaded handgun and was sentenced in 2000 for that crime as well as robberies of two other gas stations, a dry cleaner and a laundromat.

He was sentenced to 22 years in prison and is scheduled for release in 2017.

'All of them (crimes) involved guns — I knew I was going down,' said Lecuyer. 'I was a junkie.'

Admitting he was a drug addict before his entry to prison, Lecuyer is proud to have never failed a drugs test inside prison.

'I’m not trying to get out of anything I’ve done,' said inmate.

Since his hunger protest began in July, Lecuyer has refused all solid food.

He takes coffee in the morning with milk and sugar and has allowed staff to give him saline or electrolytes intravenously four times.

William Lecuyer has been kept alive by consuming nutritional drinks such as Ensure weekly

Since December, he has had one nutritional drink, such as Ensure, at least once a week. However, Ross said the drinks now increase his blood pressure, indicating that his body is shutting down.

His mother, Jane Chambers has understandably been pushed to her wits end by her sons stance.

'He’s going to keep fighting the battle — I just hope he’s alive if he wins it,' said Chambers.

And Lecuyer himself is pessimistic about the outcome of his hunger strike.

'There ain’t really much plans for the future,' he said.
