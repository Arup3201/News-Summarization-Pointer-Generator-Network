Anna Wintour sparked confusion after she was spotted carrying a rather dated looking flip phone last week, but it appears she has traded it in for something more modern.

At Carolina Herrera's New York Fashion Week presentation on Monday, the Vogue editor was pictured sitting in the front row clutching a Starbucks cup in one hand and an iPhone in the other.

The 64-year-old fashion maven attended the show in a feminine floral dress and her favorite nude slingbacks, keeping warm with a yellow cardigan draped over her back.

Selection: Judging by the photos of her today using the up-to-date gadget, it appears she may have a whole collection of phones to pick and choose from

The mother-of-two had people convinced that she was lagging in modern technology when she was pictured using an out-of-fashion flip phone at the U.S. Open in New York on Thursday.

She peered out from her signature dark sunglasses to look more closely at the tiny screen on the phone, which looked to be a $15 pay-as-you go phone from AT&T.

But judging by the photos of her today using a much more up-to-date gadget, it appears she may have a whole collection of phones to pick and choose from. 

Perhaps she was saving the photo space on her iPhone for snapping pictures at Fashion Week. 

The flip phone model she was using, an AT&T Z222 GoPhone, has a small two-inch display screen and offers texting and calling but no apps.

Anna Wintour is believed to be using the AT&T Z222, a retro-styled 'flip' handset available on AT&T's pay as you go 'GoPhone' service for just $14.99.

It offers texting and access to some email accounts - but no apps. It's unlikely Wintour is able to take a decent snap either - the handset only has a VGA camera with a resolution of less than a megapixel - far less than those found in modern phones.

AT&T boasts it will 'bring a nice balance of features and design to your fingertips.'

Perhaps the editor, who is known to be a creature of habit, simply likes to stick with what she knows best.

Indeed, back in 2004 she was seen using a similar flip phone while watching a Michael Kors runway show, although that particular model looked even more retro with an antenna.

By 2007, she graduated to a somewhat sleeker model - the Motorola Razr, which she brandished proudly at yet another fashion show.

From 2009 to 2012, Ms Wintour was pictured multiple times using a Blackberry, and it seemed she had finally found a modern phone she liked.

And just last year, she was seen carrying around both a Blackberry and an iPhone, a symbol of her busy business life.

So it's a mystery as to why she would have downgraded back to a flip phone to watch the tennis this year.

Still stylish: Sitting next to Hugh Jackman at the match, she looked typically chic in a floral patterned dress and maroon cardigan, her hair styled in her usual sleek bob

Sitting next to Hugh Jackman at the match, Ms Wintour looked typically chic in a floral patterned dress and maroon cardigan, her hair styled in her usual sleek bob. 

The usually steely mother-of-two let her guard down to cheer excitedly for the tennis players, throwing her fists in the air and smiling at each exciting moment of the match. 

The lively experience was likely a welcome break for Ms Wintour, who had been busy preparing for New York Fashion Week, which officially began on Thursday. 

As arguably the most respected editor in the fashion industry, she has been observing many of the big shows from the front row.

Though it may be easy to mock Ms Wintour's low-tech choice of phone, she may actually be on the money.

A recent trend observed by MailOnline has seen classic 1990s models by Nokia, Ericsson and Motorola commanding four-figure sums on eBay and other resale sites. 

While they may lack features, these retro phones are simple to use, have batteries that last the week and are practically indestructible compared to their smartphone equivalents. 

‘Some people don't blink at the prices, we have models at more than €1,000 (£810 or $1,360),’ said Djassem Haddad, who started the site vintagemobile.fr in 2009.

‘The high prices are due to the difficulty in finding those models, which were limited editions in their time.’ 

French online shop Lekki, which sells a range of vintage, revamped mobile phones, claims simplicity is the way forward. 

‘Too many online social networks and an excess of email and applications, have made us slaves to technology in our everyday life,’ it said on its website. 

‘We have two types of profiles: the 25 to 35 year-olds attracted by the retro and offbeat side of a telephone that is a little different, and those who are nostalgic for the phone that they used when they were younger,’ said Maxime Chanson, who founded Lekki in 2010.

‘Some use it to complement their smartphone, but others are going for the vintage, tired of the technology race between the phone makers.’

Here are some of the retro phones making a comeback:

Motorola StarTac 130: A model launched in 1998 - and repainted bright orange was recently offered for €180 (£145 or $245). Ironically, the trend is just starting as the telecommunications industry throws such handsets into the recycling bins, hailing smartphones as the way ahead.

Nokia 8210: Has a tiny monochrome screen and plastic buttons, at €59.99 (£48 or $80). Finnish firm Nokia, the biggest mobile phone company before the advent of Apple's iPhone or Samsung's Galaxy, offloaded its handset division to Microsoft this year after failing to catch the smartphone wave

Nokia 8210, $80

Nokia 8800 Arte Gold: Currently listed  for €1,000 (£810 or $1,360), while a Nokia 8800 could be purchased for €250 (£200 or $337).
