Jose Mourinho says he has set himself the goal of winning every major trophy in England once again in his second spell at Chelsea — starting with the Capital One Cup final against Tottenham at Wembley.

Mourinho, however, says his love for English football has been tested by the suspensions of Diego Costa and Nemanja Matic, the latter missing Sunday's final, and by refereeing decisions in recent weeks, which he considers controversial.

Mourinho is already one of the most decorated managers ever in English football having won two Premier League titles, one FA Cup and two League Cups in his first spell at Chelsea. He says his target is now to repeat the grand slam of trophies.

‘I had the one aim of winning every title in the three most important countries — Italy, Spain and England,’ he said. ‘I had that aim and if I had missed one I would not have been happy. If I missed a cup or a super cup (community shied) I would not be happy, I wanted to win every title in those countries and I did that.

‘I achieved my goals in terms of the trophies I want to win. I won the trophies in every country; the Champions League, the UEFA Cup, now the Europa League. Now it is about repeating it. I want to change the numbers. Two League Cups and I want more. One FA Cup and I want more. Two Premier Leagues and I want more.’

After managing Porto to two league titles, a domestic cup, the UEFA Cup and the Champions League, Mourinho went on to Chelsea and then to Spain and Italy. He won La Liga with Real Madrid as well as Serie A twice with Inter, as well as the Copa del Rey and the Coppa Italia and, of course, the Champions League with Inter in 2010.

But Mourinho maintains that his passion for English football has been tested since his return in 2013. Matters have come to a head with Matic’s two-match suspension for retaliating to a horror tackle by Ashley Barnes, for which the Burnley player received no punishment.

Asked whether he would still say that he loved English football, he said: ‘Good question. That I love it? Yes. I would not change my feelings about it. About my desire to work for this club? No change. Exactly the same. But in this moment maybe in two, three, four months, maybe I can change my feelings. In this moment I’m a bit disappointed, yes.

‘My passion is the game. It’s not the media. The only way for my frustration to go away is to play matches and to finish matches with the best feeling. And to finish matches with the best feeling is not just because you win.

‘I remember clearly when we lost our first game of the season, at Newcastle, and after the game I told the media this was the way I like to lose. Great referee, no controversial decisions, we played well and tried everything and were unlucky — this is the way I like to lose.

‘But I don’t want to go. I only go when Mr Abramovich tells me to go. I am not thinking about leaving, I want to stay at Chelsea for the rest of my career. But I repeat, I am in Mr Abramovich’s hands.’
