Ruling: Mr Justice Keehan today dissolved the sham marriage at the High Court after he decided that the victim lacked the mental capacity to make the decision to marry

A Pakistani man groomed a teenager with learning difficulties before marrying her in a desperate attempt to stay in Britain, the High Court heard today.

The immigrant wanted to wed his vulnerable victim believing he would avoid being deported because it would breach his human rights.

Judge Mr Justice Keehan said today exploiting 'young and vulnerable' adults by targeting them for sham marriages will not be tolerated by the courts, as he struck out their marriage as unlawful.

Sitting in the Court of Protection, the judge said the man, who is in his twenties, exploited and took advantage of her 'for the purpose of seeking to bolster his immigration appeal and his prospects of being permitted to remain in this country'.

He was deported in 2012.

Declaring the ceremony a 'non-marriage', the judge emphasised: 'It is vital that the message is clearly sent out to those who seek to exploit young and vulnerable adults that the courts will not tolerate such exploitation.'

None of the parties can be named because of a court order. The young woman at the centre of the case, who is now aged 19, is referred to as SY in the ruling, and the man as TK.

Mr Justice Keehan said it was 'plain on the facts of this case' that TK 'exploited and took advantage of SY for the purpose of seeking to bolster his immigration appeal and his prospects of being permitted to remain in this country', adding that the June 2012 ceremony he and SY engaged in at TK's home 'formed the bedrock of that objective'.

He said: 'TK well knew that SY had learning difficulties and was a vulnerable young woman. He knew that the police and the care services were extremely concerned about his involvement with SY.

'I can reach no other conclusion than he deliberately targeted SY because of her learning difficulties and her vulnerability. The courts will not tolerate such gross exploitation.'

The judge added: 'Fortunately, it would appear that TK's involvement in SY's life is not now causing her emotional distress or harm.

'It was, however, yet another abusive and exploitative episode in her life which could have had serious physical, emotional and psychological consequences for her.'

He said: 'In my judgment it is important for SY that a declaration of non-marriage is made in respect of the June 2012 ceremony.

'There are also, in my judgment, compelling reasons of public policy why sham 'marriages' are declared non-marriages. It is vital that the message is clearly sent out to those who seek to exploit young and vulnerable adults that the courts will not tolerate such exploitation.'

Cynical: The High Court heard that the Pakistani male - known as TK - had hoped the sham marriage would help his human rights case - but he was still deported in 2012

The judge's message came as part of a ruling involving an application made by a local authority in the Court of Protection in respect of the capacity of the young woman to litigate and to make decisions relating to her life.

In his conclusions, Mr Justice Keehan states: 'It is plain from all of the evidence before me that SY lacks the capacity to litigate and the capacity to make decisions about her residence, her contact with others, her care package and to enter a contract of marriage.'

He ruled that she does have the capacity to consent to sexual relations.

TK, who was born in Pakistan, came to the UK in 2009 as a student. His application to continue his studies was refused and his appeal was dismissed on the basis of a tribunal finding that he had submitted two forged documents and had attempted to deceive the immigration authorities.

His rights of appeal were exhausted in June 2011. The judge said: 'It is in this context that he began a relationship with SY in August 2011.'

On or around June 15 2012 he was arrested for immigration offences and detained by the UK Border Agency pending his deportation.

He claimed asylum on the basis that he feared he would be killed by his family who disapproved of his marriage to a white British woman.

In July 2012 his appeal against the refusal to grant him asylum was dismissed on all grounds - his relationship with SY 'lay at the heart of the case he sought to mount' - and he was deported the following month.

The judge said: 'Happily it appears that after particularly difficult and turbulent experiences over, at least, the last eight years, SY is now settled and contented in her current placement. She is enjoying her college course which she embarked on a few months ago.'

He added: 'It is pleasing to note that SY has been successfully assisted with an appropriate placement, care package and support to be leading a stable and happy life with positive experiences for her.'
