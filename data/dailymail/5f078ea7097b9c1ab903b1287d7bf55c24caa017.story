Swiss Alpine cows, adorned with flowers and ribbons, have just been brought down to lower mountain pastures, signalling the imminent arrival of winter.

But despite Switzerland celebrating 150 years of winter-sports tourism this year, new legislation demanding that the Swiss minimum wage is paid to staff in British-run chalets has all but wiped out the value end of chalet ski holidays in the country.

As most UK companies cannot afford the cost, they have simply pulled out of the market. Only the most luxurious chalets remain, but these fetch on average £2,000 per person, per week – and that’s excluding flights.

Switzerland celebrates 150 years of winter sports tourism this year

UK companies have pulled out of the Switzerland's value for sports tourism  due to the new legislation 

As Andy Perrin, of holiday firm Inghams and its sister companies Ski Total and Esprit Ski told The Mail on Sunday: ‘There are no winners with this legislation.’

That said, it is possible to find some good-value holidays heading into the new ski season – even in top Swiss hotels. 

For example, the five-star Tschuggen Grand Hotel in Arosa (tschuggen.ch) is offering three nights in a deluxe room on a half-board basis from £621pp, departing November 27.

The cost includes fine dining, free access to the hotel spa, exclusive use of Arosa’s slopes on November 28 and a ski pass for the following day when lifts and slopes are open to all. 

Flights between Gatwick and Geneva with easyJet (easyjet.com) start at about £24 one way.

To kick off the winter season in Ischgl in Austria, pop star James Blunt will be performing at the Top Of The Mountain concert on Saturday, 29 November.

The chic resort of Megeve in France is braced for the opening of a new Folie Douce on the summit of Mont Joly. This chain of apres-ski venues is famous for its raucous and risque style of entertainment.

Elizabeth Cahir, from Megeve specialists Stanford Skiing, said: ‘It will be an interesting introduction to our quiet resort.’

In Canada, the little known Sun Peaks resort in British Columbia continues to grow, and is now ranked just behind Whistler. Ski Safari (skisafari.com, 01273 224060) offers five nights on a room-only basis in each resort from £1,339pp, including flights and transfers.
