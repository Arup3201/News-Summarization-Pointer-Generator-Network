A mother-of-four who weighed 38st at her heaviest has learnt gastric bypass surgery is no quick fix to weight loss.

Paula, 39, from Atlanta, Georgia, in the U.S., struggled to lose weight after initially having the operation as she continued to gorge on junk food and made excuses for not sticking to a diet.

The telesales worker shares her story on TLC show My 600Ib Life as cameras follow her for a year on her weightloss journey.

Burden: At 38st, Paula's children have to put her shoes on for her

In pain: The mother-of-four admits simply day-to-day activities hurt because of her size

Setting an example: Paula wants to change her ways so her children have a healthier future

Paula reveals that she gained weight by comfort eating at the age of six following a childhood trauma where she was molested by a family member. She then gained 50lb (more than 3st) carrying each of her children till she eventually tipped the scales at 38st.

She said: 'I wish I had been taught that food is fuel,
 that it's what you put in your body to make it go. I don't eat for 
fuel but for enjoyment. I love food. I have a relationship with food. 
When it tastes good it takes me to a happy place.

'When I didn't have 
friends or family there for me, food was. It doesn't hurt you 
emotionally even though it does physically.'

She admitted her love of food was ruining her life - and that of her three teenagers and her eight-year-old daughter.

Goal: Paula is eventually approved for gastric bypass surgery

Fast food addicts: She hopes the operation will help her lose weight as she and her family don't eat well

'When you're this big it effects 
everything,' she said. 'It hurts to move it hurts to walk. I'm huge. I'm a monster. 
All the day-to-day tasks that people take for granted are difficult for me 
to do.

'I can't take care of my family. The kids have to take care of the 
house and I am heavily dependent on them. I am a burden to my children and I don't want them to be picked on because of what I look like.'

Her eldest daughter Madison admits: 'I have to put her socks and 
shoes on and rub lotion on her. It's like she's a disabled person. I feel like 
I'm doing more than a teenager should be doing.'

Paula said she hates being a burden to her children but her wake-up call to change her ways came after she lost her husband, Alan. He was morbidly obese and died at the age of 33.

She said: 'His weight killed him. He was over 600lb and his kidney weren't functioning. His health got worse and worse. On some days he couldn't even get out of bed and wasn't living life at all.

'One day his heart stopped beating and they couldn't restart it. I don't think that I'm far 
behind him. I won't be here soon if I don't make a change.'

Drastic action: Paula lost her husband because he was obese and doesn't want to die young like him

No excuses: Dr Nowzaradan tells her that in order for the surgery to work, she needs to commit to exercising and healthy eating

Paula believes the answer is to have gastric bypass surgery and she's so determined to get it, she moves her family 800 miles to Houston, Texas, to be near Doctor Nowzaradan who she hopes will approve her for the operation.

The doctor tells Paula that first she has to make lifestyle changes and she won't be allowed to have surgery until she has proved this by losing some weight.

Paula is adamant that she can do it - but on her return visit a month later she has gained a more than a stone.

She explained that it's too hard to eat foods Dr Nowzaradan recommended. She blamed her weight gain on fluid in her legs, her sedentary state working at a computer eight hours a day and only being able to eat fast food when travelling between Georgia and Houston to visit extended family.

She said: 'I know I eat too many carbs and I 
don't exercise. My family and I have been eating fast foods our whole lives. It's going to hard to change all these habits. Everytime there is an event or family 
gathering we have lots of food. I associate food with good moments.'

She added: 'It's difficult to eat properly on the 
road, the best option is fast food and there aren't a lot of healthy options
 at drive-thrus. I know I'm eating foods I 
shouldn't be but finding foods the doctor is OK with is difficult.'

Difficult: At first she struggles to stop eating junk food because she enjoys the taste and can't find healthy food at drive-thrus

Dr Nowzaradan tells Paula to stick to a liquid diet of soup and yoghurt for a month.

'You need to stop making excuses or 
surgery will never work. You clearly have an eating disorder,' he told her. 'I cannot
 approve your surgery until you have lost some weight.'

The liquid diet works and on her next visit, Paula is 10Ib lighter and approved for surgery. She has a gastric bypass and a hernia removed.

But it appears she still hasn't changed her mindset as on her return from the hospital, she stops at a drive-thru to buy her children's dinner.

Then after a visit to the gym, where she struggled to workout because she was so unfit, she eats a calorific McDonald's burrito on her way home.

Progress: A year after her op, Paula has lost 11st after going to the gym regularly

As a result of her inability to ditch junk food, six months after her operation she had barely lost any weight.

She then decides to start seeing a therapist which proves to be a breakthrough in readdressing her relationship with food.

A year after the surgery, she has lost 11st and finally found new happiness in exercising and being active.

She and her family have started doing family work out sessions with a personal trainer and eating less fast food.

Paula said: 'Part of this journey was to be a better mother and be a more active family. The progress may have been slower than I wanted but I'm still working towards my goal. When I look in the mirror I see someone who is happier. I am starting to like me.'
