Brendan Rodgers has defended his £23.6million investment in Adam Lallana and insisted Liverpool have not paid over the odds for the England midfielder.

Lallana officially started his Liverpool career this week here in Boston and has made an immediate impression on the training pitches at Harvard University with his slick use of the ball and willingness to embrace hard work.

Rodgers is thrilled with how quickly 
the 26-year-old has settled down and, having put such an emphasis on 
signing Lallana from Southampton, is adamant he will make a difference 
as Liverpool aim to build on last season’s promise and progress without 
Luis Suarez.

Yet, for all 
that, the size of Lallana’s fee has been scrutinised, not least because 
Real Madrid only paid £1m more to take World Cup winner Toni Kroos from 
Bayern Munich; Rodgers, however, believes Lallana will prove he has 
value, maintaining Liverpool were not held to ransom in negotiations.

‘For
 British players across the board there is always that premium and the 
value is always pushed up,’ said Rodgers, whose side played the first 
game of their American tour against Roma in the early hours of this 
morning. ‘We paid what we thought he was worth and would not go higher.

‘Listen,
 I spoke to enough people about him and have seen enough of him, and 
know enough people who had seen him and played with him to know he would
 be a great signing for us. I have no qualms about it. He is a great 
boy.

‘The types of players 
we bring in will have the profile of what we want, so the transition 
should be smooth. Of course, it will be strange for them at times coming
 into a new team, but you see it with Adam straight away he presses for 
the ball when he does not have it and he has beautiful balance.

‘He
 can score goals and create goals. He is a wonderful footballer. I have 
been impressed by his mentality and character. Was he our main signing? 
They are all big signings as they will all make a big contribution. I 
need them to do that with being in the Champions League this year.’

So
 far Lallana has been one of five new signings but there will be more to
 come, with Loic Remy’s £8.5m switch from QPR expected to be made 
official on Thursday and confidence mounting that they will also land 
Southampton’s £20m defender Dejan Lovren.

Once
 Rodgers completes his overhaul, he will have paid out more than £100m 
and that, inevitably, means Liverpool’s performances will be put under 
the microscope, just as Tottenham were dissected 12 months ago after 
investing a similar amount following the sale of Gareth Bale.

Such
 a major outlay invites pressure yet that does not unsettle Rodgers. He 
argues his spending has been responsible and explains there is a plan to
 what Liverpool have done; some fans on Merseyside have clamoured for 
him to sign a ‘big’ name but he isn’t a manager who will spend for the 
sake of it.

‘I have always 
said at every club I’ve been at, the club’s money is my money,’ said 
Rodgers. ‘I’m there to serve the club and run it the best I can on the 
field and work with the owners off it. They know I push for the best 
players to come in and they gain the trust with how we work.

‘There
 is money available but we know spending money does not guarantee 
success. Last January everyone was crying out that we needed more 
signings. We never signed anyone. OK, we might have done one or two but 
it was not a major factor in us not winning (the title).

‘The
 players we’ve brought in were players we wanted anyway. It was well 
documented our squad last year was too thin so we needed to bring in 
players to get that level and depth up. Our signings are strategic 
signings. They are not just names. They all fit into the purpose of the 
team

‘If that means we do 
not spend all the money or the net spend is the same, then so be it. The
 character is important. It is not just about the player, but the right 
type of person. I want players that are committed to the cause to make 
Liverpool the best they can be.’
