They are only a few inches tall, but these two wild crane chicks come with very high hopes.

The pair of hatchlings are the first new generation of wild cranes seen in western Britain in 400 years.

It is a huge success for conservationists after sustained efforts to reintroduce UK’s tallest birds to their wetland habitats.

Chicks: This pair of hatchlings are the first new generation of wild cranes seen in western Britain in 400 years

The wild crane, which stands four feet tall, was once commonplace in the south-west.

But the bird was considered a vital part of the medieval banquet table - and cranes were hunted to extinction by the 1600s.

The two chicks hatched at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust Slimbridge reserve in Gloucestershire.

Parent birds Chris and Monty, which were hand-reared as part of the Great Crane Project reintroduction scheme, tried to breed last year but a chick died in bad weather before leaving the nest.

This year two healthy chicks have been spotted on their first walk away from the nest, as their parents fed them on grubs. 

So far they have stayed close to the nest site, which indicates there is plenty of food around for them.

That is encouraging for the youngsters as cranes usually hatch two chicks but one will perish if food is scarce.

Nigel Jarrett, the trust’s head of conservation breeding, said the chick’s arrival was incredibly exciting.

Pleased: TV naturalist Stephen Moss described the chicks' arrival as 'a wonderful story'

He hopes it will be part of a new generation of wild cranes. 

‘There’s been an overwhelmingly positive response to the return of the cranes from people across the west of Britain,’ he said. 

‘They are a fantastic advert for restoring wetland habitats.’ 

Some cranes have regained a foothold in East Anglia and nearly 80 have been reintroduced to western Britain in the past four years.

They have been a strong draw for visitors to Gloucestershire, where volunteers have dressed in crane costumes to hand rear chicks.

TV naturalist Stephen Moss said: ‘It is a wonderful story. They started reintroducing cranes to Slimbridge four years ago, bringing them over from Germany. 

‘They were hand raised and then released on the Somerset Levels. But quite bizarrely they have flown back to Slimbridge to breed, back to the place they were raised. They must have some kind of homing signal.’ 

Mr Jarrett first spotted the chick on a webcam trained on the nest.

He said: ‘It’s incredibly exciting to be on the cusp of a new generation of totally wild cranes that will hopefully start to recolonise parts of Britain that haven’t seen cranes for four centuries.

‘The chick hatching last year confirmed that the cranes we hand-reared were physically able to breed. 

‘This year we’ve got everything crossed that everything goes in their favour and they can rear this chick.’ 

Damon Bridge of the RSPB added: ‘The young cranes are learning and adapting to their new home in the UK and are still searching for suitable sites to successfully rear their young.’

In 1215, Henry III (pictured) and his guests ate an incredible 115 cranes at his Christmas feast in York

Wild cranes are Britain’s tallest bird, standing four feet tall and with an eight-foot wing span.

They
 were once common in Britain, but they were driven to extinction by 
hunters catching them for their meat and the draining of their wetlands 
habitats.

Before the birds completely disappeared hunting cranes 
became the preserve of the nobility and a tax was put on the collection 
of their eggs.

In 1215, Henry III and his guests ate an 
incredible 115 cranes at his Christmas feast in York, alongside an array
 of bitterns and ducks, and during a feast to enthrone Archbishop 
Neville in the fifteenth century, the guests consumed 204 birds.

Hundreds
 of towns and villages in the UK have the element ‘cran’ in their name -
 such as Cranford, Cranbrook and Cranmore - because they were known for 
having large populations of cranes.

Scientists believe crane
 footprints found in the Severn Estuary suggest they were breeding in 
large numbers in Britain as far back as the Mesolithic era – around 
11,000 years ago.

The oldest ever crane was a Siberian Crane 
named Wolf who died at the ripe old age of 83, according to the Guinness
 Book of World Records. Most cranes live to 20 years.

In Japan, 
the crane is regarded as a symbol of good fortune and longevity because 
of its fabled life span of a thousand years. It also represents fidelity
 as Japanese cranes are known to mate for life.
