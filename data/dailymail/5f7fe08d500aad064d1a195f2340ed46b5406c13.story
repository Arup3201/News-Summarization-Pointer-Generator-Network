Up to fourteen people, including six children, were feared dead after a huge explosion destroyed a five-storey building on the outskirts of Paris today.

An eight-year-old child and an elderly woman have been confirmed as being among the casualties, while more people, among them at least five children, are thought to be trapped beneath the rubble of the block after its partial collapse early at around 8am this morning.

The blast was heard across the north eastern suburb of Rosny-sous-Bois, and early indications suggested it had been caused by a gas leak.

Theory: France's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, who has visited the scene, said that a gas leak was among the theories being considered for the cause of the blast

Philippe Galli, Seine-Saint-Denis prefect, said the explosion was 'most probably' the result of a gas leak. 

Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve visited the scene, but could not confirm a theory that the explosion was caused by a gas leak.

'I’m here to give my support to the emergency services,' he said. 

'My thoughts are with the families involved, and the huge amount of suffering they are going through.'

Location: The explosion took place in Rosny-sous-Bois, a north eastern suburb of Paris

Mr Cazeneuve said a gas leak was an early theory, but added that 'we must be careful’ about rushing to conclusions as the the cause of the explosion.

He said that the 22 people living in the remaining two thirds of the building have been given emergency accomodation as the rest of the structure is at risk of collapse.

Speaking at a socialist party conference in La Rochelle, Prime Minister Manuel Valls began his speech by sending out a 'message of solidarity' to the victims of the explosion.
