A former interrogation centre, where Hitler’s deputy Rudolph Hess was held, is being turned into deluxe apartments.

Latchmere House, in Richmond upon Thames, Surrey, was known as Camp 020 during World War Two and was used to extract information from captured German agents.

Several Nazi leaders were held there, and local historians count Hess, and William Joyce - better known as wireless traitor Lord Haw-Haw - among their number.

Berkeley Homes has put forward two plans for HMP Latchmere on the edge of Ham and Richmond Park

Developers have bought the building, which operated a prison until 2011.

Berkeley Homes has put forward two plans for HMP Latchmere on the edge of Ham and Richmond Park.

Plan A envisages 60 family houses and seven apartments within the restored Latchmere House; while Plan B would see 55 family houses, 29 new apartments and, again, seven apartments within the restored house.

The developer has also been asked by Friends of Latchmere House to extend the Tudor Library site to house an exhibition on its fascinating past, as well as include the aeronautical history of north Kingston.

The plans will be decided by Richmond Council, although Kingston Council will also have a say.

Latchmere House was built in the 19th century, and was used as a hospital for treating shell-shocked officers during World War I.

During World War Two, it doubled as a shadowy interrogation base for prisoners of war, suspected Nazi double and even triple agents.

Councillor David Cunningham said the history of the site should be remembered.

Lord Haw-Haw (William Joyce), the Nazi propaganda broadcaster said to have been held at Latchmere (pictured with his wife Margaret)

He said: 'It is fascinating because of the history going back to World War One. It is a history that needs to be remembered.'

Hopes it could help ease Kingston and Richmond’s schools place crisis were ruled out in 2012 as it was 'too expensive' to buy from the Ministry of Justice.

MI5 documents released in 1999 showed 480 suspects passed through Camp 020 during the war.

The prison service took over the site in 1948, and it was used as a resettlement prison to help rehabilitate prisoners before release.

An impression of how some of the new houses may look at the site

Its first inmates were members of the British Union of Fascists. Some were held in cells brightly lit 24 hours a day, others in cells kept in total darkness

MI5 operated Camp 020, at Latchmere House - where its 30 rooms were turned into cells with hidden microphones.

The first of the German spies who arrived in Britain in September 1940 were taken there. Vital information about a coming German invasion was extracted at great speed.

This indicates the use of extreme methods, but these were desperate days demanding desperate measures.

In charge was Colonel Robin Stephens, known as ‘Tin Eye’, because of the monocle fixed to his right eye.

It was not a term of affection. The object of interrogation, Stephens told his officers, was simple: ‘Truth in the shortest possible time.’

A top secret memo spoke of ‘special methods’, but did not elaborate.

He arranged for an additional 92-cell block to be added to Latchmere House, plus a punishment room — known chillingly as Cell 13 — which was completely bare, with smooth walls and a linoleum floor.

Close to 500 people passed through the gates of Camp 020. Principal among them were German spies, many of whom were ‘turned’ and persuaded — or maybe forced — to work for MI5.

Its first inmates were members of the British Union of Fascists.  Some were held in cells brightly lit 24 hours a day, others in cells kept in total darkness.

Several prisoners were subjected to mock executions and were knocked about by the guards. Some were apparently left naked for months at a time.

Camp 020 had a resident medical officer, Harold Dearden, a psychiatrist who dreamed up regimes of starvation and of sleep and sensory deprivation intended to break the will of its inmates.

He experimented in techniques of torment that left few marks — methods that could be denied by the torturers and that civil servants and government ministers could disown...
