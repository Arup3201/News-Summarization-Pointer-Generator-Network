Hostages caught in Sydney's 17-hour terror siege have revealed how some of them managed to escape when the gunman's back was turned.

Before the siege in Sydney's Martin Place came to a dramatic end, the world watched as individuals and small groups emerged from the premises with terror in their eyes.

At first it was thought the self-styled sheikh Man Haron Monis had released them, but it was later confirmed that they fled when he dropped his guard.

Chilling warning: Gunman Man Haron Monis told hostages he would start killing them if they tried to escape in 'an eye for an eye' after five captives managed to get free, including cafe worker Elly Chen

Five hostages escaped hours before the final showdown with police left two hostages and the gunman dead

Their brave escape prompted an angry response from Monis, who threatened to take 'an eye for an eye'.  

A 19-year-old who was being held captive rang The Daily Telegraph newspaper to tell of his ordeal and relay the gunman's demands.

'If someone else runs, someone dies,’ the terrified young man quoted Monis as telling his captives.

The hostage described the moment Monas, 49, who was charged with ordering the killing of his ex-wife, put a gun to his head and told him to broadcast his demands to the media.

The hostage crisis was confirmed to have ended at 3am Tuesday morning after seven hostages fled the cafe

At approximately 2.10am on Tuesday morning the crisis ended dramatically, with police using live ammunition and stun grenades to disorient the gunman and attempt to rescue the hostages remaining inside the building

‘I have had a shotgun put at my head and all (he) wants is (the demands met). We are all afraid. I don’t think you need to have ever had a shotgun placed at your head,’

‘Yes we do need help, but that will only happen if demands are met. We have been treated very well,’ he said.

The call came after five of up to 20 hostages taken when Monis stormed the cafe around 9.30am on Monday managed to escape out of a fire door.

Hours later, at shortly after 2am on Tuesday morning the crisis ended dramatically, with police using live ammunition and stun grenades as they stormed the cafe moments after six of the remaining hostages made a break for it and appeared outside the cafe.

Police confirmed that at least two people had been killed in the extraordinary operation.

Reason reported that Monas became enraged when several of his captives bolted out of the small Sydney cafe this afternoon

Sheikh Monis was confirmed dead, and another hostage is believed to have been killed during the crisis.

Earlier on Monday night, Seven Network reporter Chris Reason had been live tweeting the hostage’s ordeal from his vantage point inside the Seven newsroom in Martin Place.

Reason reported that Monas became enraged when several of his captives bolted out of the small Sydney cafe this afternoon.

The Daily Telegraph reported that the hostages attempted to flee when they saw a moment of opportunity, and were not released by Monis as originally believed.

'The gunman became extremely agitated and started shouting (the moment they escaped). I'm assuming that, I must confess,' Reason told ABC radio..

'They would have all been a bit more calm, hands on heads (if they had been let go). This was a sheer bolt for freedom.'

Elly Chen was one of the few to escape in the early hours of Monday afternoon, fleeing into the waiting arms of the Police Rescue squad.

The siege came to a dramatic and bloody end when police stormed the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place

The 22-year-old barista and student was the fifth hostage to escape, followed by one of her colleagues.

As photos emerged of the hostages pressed up against the window of the Lindt Café, Reason tweeted that he was so close he could see the redness in their eyes as they sobbed.

'We can see the faces of hostages - pained, strained, eyes red and raw,' he tweeted, noting that one of the hostages had their 'head in their hands'.

The explicit and detailed demands of Monis were made via messages to the hostage’s loved ones and statuses posted on social media, which revealed disturbing details of Monas’ mindset.

Three videos were posted onto YouTube, showing three women reciting demands Monas had instructed them to deliver, for Prime Minister Tony Abbott to speak directly to the self-style Islamic leader.

A video showing a middle-aged woman standing in front of the makeshift ISIL flag revealed another innocent person caught in the middle of the terrifying situation.

‘The brother has looked after us all, we are very tired, we’ve got pregnant ladies in here and sick and elderly and the very, very young staff who deserve to have a decent normal life,’ the woman said.

The unidentified woman said that Monis was standing right next to her, and that she couldn’t say anymore out of fear of ‘compromising myself and my fellow hostages.’

She made a heartfelt plea at the end of the video asking the police and the Australian public, ‘Get us the hell out of here please.’

Throughout the day members of the Australian public were reporting posts from friends and loved ones held hostage inside the café requesting that Monis’ demands be met.

The posts warned that there were other bombs hidden in the city, in streets surrounding Martin Place, and that there were two other ‘brothers’ in control of the detonation of the devices if the requests were not met.

Channel Nine was contacted by several hostages inside the café, and reports surfaced of family members being contacted by loved ones.

Mel, the mother of an apprentice plumber, told Radio 2GB's Ray Hadley she received a message from her son saying, 'Mum, I'm in the Lindt chocolate cafe in Sydney.

'My heart just dropped,' she told Hadley, who says he has had three telephone conversations with a terrified hostage inside the shop.

'I sent him a text message saying, "What's going on, are you OK?" He said, "I'm OK mum, can't talk.'

'I haven't heard anything since,' the woman said late on Monday afternoon.
