Barcelona did not insist on a 'biting clause' in Luis Suarez's contract despite fears he could bite again, according to Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu.

The Uruguayan striker is currently restricted by a four-month ban that will delay his debut with the Catalan club until late October at the earliest - but Barca claim that didn't make them rethink a move for the £75million former Liverpool hitman.

And while Bartomeu said another biting incident 'could happen' - the team that claim to be 'more than just a club' have not enforced a contractual agreement linked to biting on their new 'perfect player'.

'We didn't rethink this decision and we told Luis after the bite. He knows he did wrong,' Bartomeu told CNN.

'He apologized. That's very important for us. That means he knows that he did not do things properly - and of course, coming to our city, coming to our club, there's going to be a way of managing Luis Suarez, because at Liverpool he was a perfect player.'

Regarding what Barcelona would do if Suarez was to bite again - having done so on Ajax, Liverpool and Uruguay duty, Bartomeu was unwilling to commit to any form of action.

'This is a question that a lot of people now ask us,' he said. 'We cannot talk about something that could happen or not. We don't know. What we know is that we accept this responsibility and he also wants this responsibility.

'There is no clause. If the clause did exist we wouldn't say it, but it doesn't exist.'
