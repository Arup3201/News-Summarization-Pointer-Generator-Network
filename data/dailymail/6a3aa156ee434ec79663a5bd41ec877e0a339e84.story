She may have been working in the industry for nearly 15 years but Sophie Ellis-Bextor's dazzling career shows no sign of slowing down anytime soon.

The ex-Strictly Come Dancing contestant and pop star has been unveiled as the face of fashion brand Phase Eight for Spring/Summer 2015.

Proving that she's more than just a clothes horse, the 35-year-old  singer-songwriter worked with the brand to create the campaign, which aims to epitomise the femininity and elegance of the designs.

Modelling the latest collection in a hazy shoot, Sophie showcases the feminine lace and floral print designs.

The garments, which are mostly Fifties-inspired and cost between £110-£169, are designed to be worn both at the office or at a social event and each look is completed with  jewellery, heels and clutch bags from the collection.

Speaking about her new shoot, Sophie said: ‘This collection provides perfect outfit solutions for summer weddings and garden parties where you always want to feel special and unique. 

'I love how the collection exudes feminine and stylish dressing’.

The brand say she is the 'ultimate Phase Eight woman'  because she is successful, confident, loves fashion and interprets it to work for her own personal style

The 35 year old said: 'I try to go to the gym two or three times a week if I can.' 

But she recently admitted that much of her exercise comes from running around after her three children, who are all under 11. 

This isn't the first fashion coup for Sophie; in September she was unveiled as the  face - and legs - of Pretty Polly.

The long-limbed singer signed up to front the hosiery company's autumn/winter collection for a six-month stint.

The 35-year-old also tried her hand at fashion design, launching a series of styles for the brand's collection called Flirty.
