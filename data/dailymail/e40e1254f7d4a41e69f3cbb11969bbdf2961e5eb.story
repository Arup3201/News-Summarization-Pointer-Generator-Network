A 93-year-old French man has gone on trial accused of murdering an 82-year-old love interest who rejected him.

Marcel Guillot, France's oldest inmate, is said to have broken into the home of Nicole El Dib before stabbing and beating her to death.

The Court of Assize, in Reims, yesterday heard Guillot, who denies killing Ms El Dib, had developed 'a crush' on her following the death of his wife.

Guillot and his wife had been friends with Ms El Dib and her husband for a number of years.

Ms El Dib asked Guillot to stay with her for a few weeks while her husband was in hospital, The Local has reported.

The court heard he left her house in November 2011 feeling like he had been 'rejected like a nitwit'.

Prosecutors told the court he travelled from his home in Bobigny, a suburb of Paris, back to Ms El Dib's home in the village of Saint Gilles, in the Marne department in north-eastern France, the following month.

He managed to break into her house, waking Ms El Dib in the process, before allegedly stabbing and beating her to death, the court heard.

Her body was discovered near a creek in her country estate and Guillot was arrested five months later.

Guillot allegedly said he had been made to feel like a fool and had wanted to 'teach her a lesson' when he was confronted with the details of the incident.

Guillot has acknowledged he visited the house but has denied the killing.
