They look good enough to eat and have proven to be a sweet way to raise money for charity with hundreds of people flocking to book virtual stays.

These sugary gingerbread 'holiday homes' are the brainchild of American advertising agency McKinney who designed them to raise funds for the homeless in New York City.

The three differently styled bed and breakfasts - a modern mansion, a rustic Alpine cabin and a cute camper van - are available to 'rent', with prices ranging from $5 (£3) to $20 (£13) a night.

American advertising agency McKinney designed three gingerbread bed and breakfasts to raise money for homeless people in New York City. Virtual stays in a modern mansion, a rustic cabin (pictured) and a cute camper van can be booked for between $5 (£3) to $20 (£13) a night

But holidaymakers won't actually be able to stay in the tiny houses. 

Made entirely of gingerbread, biscuits and sweets, all rental proceeds from Gingerbreadbnb will go to New York City's largest poverty-fighting organisation Robin Hood, which provides shelter to homeless families.

Guests can choose the number of nights they want to 'stay' in the gingerbread house or book a property for their family and friends.

The estate house is made from gluten-free gingerbread and locally sourced candy cane. It comes with a sugar-glass pool, fruit roll yoga mats and second-floor loft with marshmallow meditation room. All proceeds raised will go towards Robin Hood, a homeless charity in New York City

Take to the sweet open road in the candy camper van. It comes with deckchairs made from sweets and features a fruit roll awning 

Gingerbread walls of the modern home are left unpainted for a minimalist look. Modern chocolate art on the walls provide a focal talking point

The agency's site is worded exactly like a bonafide rental website and provides full gingerbread statistics for prospective tenants. 

The estate house, for instance, is made from gluten-free gingerbread and locally sourced candy cane. 

According to the website, it has a sugar glass pool, fully stocked gummy bar, priceless chocolate drip art, fruit roll yoga mats, mid-century taffy furniture, liquorice spiral staircase, second-floor loft with marshmallow meditation room, and access to jelly-bean jogging paths.

Detailed creation: The interior of the rustic cabin features a fireplace made from dried fruits and nuts and a fruit roll mat

Every item in the miniature house is crafted from sweets, chocolate or gingerbread. Fruit roll mats and boiled candy sweets also feature

Guest staying in the modern home are encouraged to make full use of the Gummy bar (pictured) and walk up the liquorice spiral staircase to the marshmallow meditation room where they can do yoga on the fruit roll mats

The rustic cabin is tucked away in the mouthwatering candy rock mountains and was 'handcrafted with reclaimed 19th-century gingerbread'.

Features and amenities include all-natural trail mix fireplace although guests are warned not to use real flames as the 'house will melt', a fully equipped kitchen with Graham cracker countertop and a Bavarian-style gingerfather clock. 

Activities nearby include access to chocolate hiking trails and candy cane skiing.

The final property in the sweet portfolio is the 'one-of-a-kind' gingerbread candy camper with stainless-sugar kitchen, ginger bunk beds, a gingerbread sofa and spare cookie tire. 

Two pretzel wheel beach cruisers are also included in the 'stay'. 

Ginger-bunk beds with sour licorice linens are provided in the gingerbread camper van for travellers looking for an adventurous holiday

Smarties act as throw cushions for the modern home's sofa. Boiled sweets are the glass for the table in the centre of the room 

A patio made from sugar and gingerbread is held up by biscuit posts. Two flower pots hold cactus, fashioned out of green sweets
