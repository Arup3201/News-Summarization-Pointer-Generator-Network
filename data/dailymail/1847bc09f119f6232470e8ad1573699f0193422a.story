A man in his 80s shot himself dead in the toilet of a doctor's surgery today sparking panic among patients.

Armed police were scrambled to the scene following reports of gunfire and a 'sudden death' at the GP practice in Frimley, Surrey.

Shocked neighbours near the Station Road Surgery wrote on Twitter about hearing 'gunshots' coming from inside the terraced building.

A police officer is standing guard at the entrance to the sealed-off surgery and a cordon has been set up around its car park.

Another
 police officer was stationed by a silver Ford Focus ST parked just 25 
yards from the surgery entrance, believed to be the dead man's car.

Witness
 Ed Tse, 25, said he heard 'a bang like a gunshot' while working in his 
father's Chinese takeaway which backs onto the surgery.

He described the aftermath at the scene as 'chaotic'.

Mr Tse, from Frimley, said: 'I heard a bang around 10.30am and at first I thought it sounded like the bins being collected.

'The surgery is always throwing stuff out so hearing the bang of a bin is quite common but this was louder.

'I went around the corner and there were lots of people and police cars around - it was chaotic.

'I did think the noise was much louder than the usual bin noise and it sounded like a gunshot.

'I've
 not heard much since but I saw people coming in and out as I came on to
 Station Road and staff were having to show IDs to police on the door.

'Police
 were not letting anyone in or out and were taking statements and 
telling people the surgery was close. I haven't spoken to police myself 
yet.'

Workers at The Mane 
Street barbers opposite the surgery said they were told a man had shot 
himself dead in the toilets at around 10.30am.

A
 female member of staff, who asked not to be named, said: 'The first 
thing we heard was the police sirens screaming as the first of nine cars
 sped up.

'Then there were armed police swarming about, the doctor's surgery was closed and nobody was allowed in.

'I didn't hear a gunshot myself but an elderly couple who had been in the surgery at the time said a man had shot himself.

'An
 ambulance turned up outside soon after the police but was turned away, 
which makes me think it's right that the gentleman died.

'The
 two cars worth of armed police had their peaked caps and full body 
armour on so it was a major incident but the staff didn't come out right
 away.

'When they eventually
 did, I saw them give statements on their way out and leave but I think 
some members of staff are still in there.

'Everyone in the surgery had to give statements to the police before they could leave at around midday.

'I don't know if any other patients are still inside.

'From what I've heard the man shot himself in the toilet or the reception area, not in an appointment.

'One customer came in and said the Ford Focus parked outside is the dead man's car.'

Police were called to the surgery in Station Road, Frimley, Surrey, at about 10.30am this morning

 Ford Focus has now been removed by a recovery firm. It had been parked 
on double yellow lines with its number plate taped over.

Jodie Skilton, 18, wrote on Twitter: 'Gunshots in frimley doctors. How scary.'

Office worker Senna Michelle, who works nearby, wrote: 'Gunshots in Frimley Doctors - scared for my life.'

Staff at the surgery, which has been sealed off, refused to comment on the incident.

Dr Samuel Coulter, a senior partner, briefly emerged from the building at around 3pm but only said he had 'nothing to add'.

Silver-haired Dr Coulter, dressed in a blue shirt, gold tie, said: 'I have nothing to add at this stage. Thank you.'

Surrey Police confirmed they were called to reports of a 'sudden death' after a firearm went off.

A spokesman said: 'We were called to the doctor's surgery just before 11am this morning following reports of a sudden death.

Shocked residents near the Station Road Surgery said they heard 'gunshots' from inside

'Officers
 and other emergency services attended the location after reports that a
 firearm had been discharged inside the building.

'The body of a man, believed to be in his 80s, was discovered at the scene, where he was pronounced dead.

'Officers are carrying out a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death.

'At this stage there is no indication of any third party involvement or wider risk to the local community.

'A post mortem examination will take place in due course.'

Police
 have made door-to-door enquiries at a nearby estate agents, lawyers 
firm, hairdresser's and a mortgage provider looking for clues.

Adam Wicks, 21, works at Vickery and Co estate agents in Frimley High Street, which is in the next road.

He said police officers had asked to see the firm's CCTV footage.

Mr
 Wicks, from Camberley, Surrey, said: 'I didn't hear anything myself as 
we're too far away but there was a lot of commotion at the surgery.

'There are about six or seven police cars all around the doctor's surgery.

'The police came in asking about our CCTV but we don't have any and they wouldn't tell us anything.'

'It's crazy. I've just heard there was a shooting and there are rumours that it was a suicide.'

Paramedics from South East Coast Ambulance Service were also scrambled to the scene.

A
 spokesman said: 'We were called just before 11am to reports of an 
incident and sent an ambulance followed by an ambulance car to the 
scene.

'Sadly, despite our paramedics' efforts they were unable to help the man and he was pronounced dead at the scene.'
