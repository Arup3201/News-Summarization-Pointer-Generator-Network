He's a decade off being able to drink it but that hasn't stopped a Colorado sixth-grader from developing a way to brew beer in space.

Michal Bodzianowski, 11, will soon get the chance to test his method, after he beat nearly 4,000 students to win a National Center for Earth and Space Science Education competition recently.

'He came up with this idea all on his own,' Michal's teacher and sponsor at the STEM School and Academy in Colorado, Sharon Combs, said.

She added, in an interview with ABC News: 'He got a book for Christmas that was about weird facts and explains how in the Middle Ages they used to drink beer because it was purer than water.'

While astronauts might find kicking back with a cold one after a day's work in space refreshing, Michal said his idea was beneficial for 'both medical and survival reasons, and it is fairly easy to conduct with limited human interactions.'

The NCESSE sponsored the competition as part of the Student Spaceflight Experiments Program, which strives to inspire the next generation of America's scientists and engineers.

Eleven proposals, out of 744 submitted by 3,900 students, were selected for the flight and include a range of students from grades 5 to 11.

Science whiz: Michal will be given a real research mini-laboratory that is scheduled to fly on the International Space Station in the coming months

'I never expected it to be one of my sixth graders,' Combs told ABC.

'But Michal's got the natural curiosity of people who go after science. He's very talented.'

Michal will be given a real research mini-laboratory that is scheduled to fly on the International Space Station in the coming months.

His experiment will be prepared on the ground and then sent up to space with an astronaut who will combine the substances and follow his instructions.

Meanwhile, the six-grader will conduct the experiment on Earth, to see how it differs.
