Lobbyist Terry Thames fell ill near the Pentagon and was taken to hospital - where experts said she does not have Ebola 

Chaos erupted outside the Pentagon today after a woman vomiting in a parking lot sparked an Ebola scare.

Terry Thames, a Washington lobbyist, got off a bus and fell ill in the parking lot, prompting a shutdown of the affected area.

But despite the swift and severe response, she was soon found not to have the disease. 

First responders say she told them she had recently been to West Africa - the epicenter of the Ebola crisis - prompting fears she had brought the deadly virus back with her.

But her employers swiftly denied she had been anywhere near the affected countries.

She was rushed to hospital where she was interviewed about her travel history and given the all-clear 

Pentagon police locked down a building entrance and a portion of a parking lot. Seven staff involved in the response were also isolated in what the Pentagon called 'an abundance of caution'.

Defense officials said they could be kept in a tent at the Pentagon overnight as a precaution. 

Several people who were on the shuttle bus also have been isolated. 

All pedestrian and vehicle traffic was stopped across 17 lanes of the huge parking lot, shortly before 10am on Friday.

The Ebola scare was caused by a woman, identified by her company today as Terry Thames, who vomited in the parking lot and allegedly said she had recently been to West Africa

A building entrance and parking lanes were temporarily closed as part of the Pentagon police's infectious disease protocols.

Ms Thames works for Total Spectrum - a lobbying and public relations firm. 

Managing Director Steve Gordon said in a statement that the Pentagon had contacted him and he said she had not been out of the Washington area. 

The lobbyist was on a Metro bus and was not believed to have been traveling to the Pentagon, which is also near a central transport hub.

However she transferred to a shuttle bus taking guests to a change of responsibility ceremony for General Joe Dunford, who is taking over as commandant of the Marine Corps. 

The Pentagon official said it did not immediately appear that she was invited to the ceremony. 

She got off the shuttle before it left the Pentagon parking lot and then vomited, prompting the Ebola scare.

Thames was taken to hospital, where experts said they were 'confident' that Ebola is not a possibility.

A statement from the public health departments of Arlington and Fairfax counties said: 'Based on the public health investigation, which included the travel history of a woman who became ill this morning in a Pentagon parking lot, and on questioning of her by medical staff, medical authorities are confident that she does not have Ebola.'

'Arlington County Fire Department Emergency Medical Services transported the woman to Fairfax Inova Hospital Friday morning, after she became ill in a Pentagon parking lot.'

'The woman had displayed symptoms consistent with the virus and her travel history was uncertain. 

'She was put in isolation at Fairfax Inova Hospital. Arlington County took all necessary precautions to protect public health during this event, including activating its Emergency Operations Center. We are beginning to break down those operations now.'

It is not clear what - if any - medical tests were carried out. It is also not clear what her true travel history is. The Pentagon insists that they were told she had been to Africa.

Lt Col Crosson, a spokesman, said: 'During the response, the individual indicated that she had recently visited Africa. 

'Out of an abundance of caution, all pedestrian and vehicular traffic was suspended around the South Parking lot, while Arlington County responded to the scene.

'At 0953, the individual was taken to the Virginia Hospital Center.

'Out of an abundance of caution and to allow the investigation to proceed, pedestrian and vehicular traffic around the Pentagon South Parking lot's lanes 7-23 will remain restricted until further notice. The Corridor 2 entrance to the Pentagon is also closed.'

Officials notified the FBI and were checking the woman's background and possible travel to West Africa.

What caused the woman to become sick is unclear. Ebola is only transmitted through direct contact with a victim's bodily fluids. 

She was being evaluated by hospital staff and the Fairfax County Health Department but it had not yet been decided whether to test her for the Ebola virus 

There has been only one case of a person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States after travel to West Africa - Thomas Eric Duncan, who died in Dallas earlier this month.

Hundreds of suspicious cases have turned out to be false alarms.
