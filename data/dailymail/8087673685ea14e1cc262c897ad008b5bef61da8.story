From prom to pits, Sage Karam has been money at Indianapolis.

The
 19-year-old Indy 500 rookie has danced in the Indianapolis Motor 
Speedway paddock at a makeshift prom, was runner-up to Scott Dixon in 
the pit crew competition and become an instant fan favorite and media 
darling with his carefree persona.

But when race time came - he put his money where his mouth is. He finished his first Indianapolis 500 in ninth place - blowing away his own goal to finish in the top 15.

Big day: Sage Karam, 19, finished ninth overall in Sunday's Indianapolis 500 - a remarkable achievement for a 19-year-old driver

Karam, a 19-year-old Pennsylvania native, has emerged as a big personality with even bigger potential in the sport of Indy Car racing

'Where's all the young girls?' he quipped before Saturday's autograph session.

Plenty
 of them were lined up for the blue-eyed, blond-haired Karam.

He's kind 
of hard to miss: Karam's mug was pasted on oversized $100 bills passed 
out around the track, a fitting tribute for his SK$ moniker.

He set a top-15 finish as a reasonable goal in an entry 
that is jointly fielded by Ganassi Racing and Dreyer & Reinbold 
Kingdom Racing.

'My friends think it's pretty cool,' Karam said. 'I haven't seen a bunch of them in a while and we're going to have some fun.'

The
 line came to a grinding halt at Saturday's autograph session at the 
table where Karam and Sebastian Saavedra were eager to greet fans.

Karam skipped his prom to practice for the Indy 500 - though it doesn't seem he missed the chance to party

Karam and girlfriend Anna de Ferran had to skip prom for their own private party later when the young driver had to practice for Indy 500 qualifying

The 
issue? Buddy Lazier had not arrived and many of the fans in line were 
waiting specifically for the 1996 winner. After a few minutes of no one 
approaching the table, Saavedra slid into Lazier's empty seat and signed
 about dozen of his autograph cards.

He pushed the signed cards forward 
and the fans began moving through the line again, taking the Lazier card
 with them.

'I guess we're a bunch of No Buddy's,' Karam wisecracked.

Karam,
 meanwhile, was his own autograph hound: He had IndyCar's security 
official take a poster of the starting field to be autographed by the 
other 32 drivers in Sunday's race.

He posed 
for pictures with Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck and Olympic
 figure skater Gracie Gold at the Indy 500 parade and posted them on his
 Instagram account.

Karam made a splash when 
he attended a prom - a big party, really - with his girlfriend, Anna de 
Ferran.

He missed because it was the same night as Indy 500 practice. 
Karam graduates from Nazareth (Pennsylvania) Area High School on June 
10.

'This whole month has been a trip,' Karam said. 'We're just hoping for a great finish to cap it off.'
