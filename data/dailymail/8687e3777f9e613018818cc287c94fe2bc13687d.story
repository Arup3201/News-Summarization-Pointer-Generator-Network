A Brisbane woman who indicated on her Centrelink form that she was in a 'friends with benefits' relationship with her housemate will be able to keep receiving Centrelink payments, a tribunal has ruled.

The welfare agency tried to deny the 46-year-old woman her carer's allowance, because it believed she was in a romantic and financially dependent relationship with her housemate, with whom she admitted she sometimes had sex.

This decision was overruled today by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Brisbane, who decreed that 'friends with benefits' did not count as a relationship and therefore the woman should have received her payments in full.

A woman was refused Centrelink payments to pay for the care of her sick mother, because she wrote on the Centrelink form that she was in a 'friends with benefits' relationship with her housemate

The woman, known as Ms T, claimed an allowance in 2012 when she became the carer for her sick mother.

Centrelink ruled she was ineligible because it believed that Mr D, her housemate, was Ms T's live-in-lover, meaning their combined income put her over the threshold to receive payments.

Ms T appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal claiming that while they sometimes slept together, she and Mr D were not exclusive and she often met other men through online dating sites for 'physical companionship'.

She told the court that at the age of 46, with two failed relationships in her past, she wanted to 'enjoy her life', reported the Sydney Morning Herald.

The tribunal ruled in favour of the woman, who claimed that since she and her housemate weren't committed she should keep receiving payments

Tribunal member Peter Wulf said that since Ms T and Mr D had separate rooms in the house, were financially independent and had no joint assets, there was no reason to believe they were in a relationship.

'Importantly, it was noted that at no time did Mr D support Ms T,' he said.

He added that Ms T's openness about seeing other men also indicated the couple were not in a de facto relationship.

'When considering a normal de facto relationship it would be unusual, in the tribunal's opinion, for such actions to occur with such regularity.'

However, Mr Wulf said Centrelink's confusion was understandable, because when filling out her forms Ms T indicated that she was part of a couple.

In the section of the form where the applicant can indicate if they are married or de facto, Ms T wrote: 'friends with benefits.'

The tribunal, which met at the Commonwealth Law Courts in Brisbane (pictured) ruled that Ms T should be paid the full amount, because she wasn't in a committed relationship with her housemate and he did not support her financially
