When her beloved husband was killed in Afghanistan, Christina Schmid thought she could never love again.

But nearly three years after Staff Sergeant Olaf ‘Oz’ Schmid died defusing a Taliban bomb, his widow has a new man in her life.

The 36-year-old met Mark Clarke, who is also a serving member of the Armed Forces, six months ago and believes her late husband would give them his blessing.

Has his blessing: Christina with Oz, whom she still loves and misses everyday

Staff Sgt Schmid, 30, died while trying to defuse a bomb in Afghanistan in October 2009, 24 hours before he was due to fly home.

He was awarded a posthumous George Cross for his bravery, which saw him disarm more than 60 explosive devices in six months.

Mrs Schmid was left devastated but knew she had to be strong for her son Laird, who is now eight.

Christina tells her story in the latest issue of Hello!

‘I didn’t know if I would ever be able to love again after I lost Oz, but Mark has taught me that I can; that I have a lot of love still left to give and a lot of life left to live,’ she told Hello! magazine.

Posing for a lavish photo spread with 30-year-old Mr Clarke, she said her love for her husband has ‘not in any way diminished’ and she misses him every day.

But she added: ‘I have been lucky enough to meet this lovely man who cares deeply for me and wants to be with me – and I adore him.’

Mrs Schmid said Laird has accepted his mother’s new partner – and is already asking if the pair will marry. ‘He wants to have brothers and sisters. Children don’t understand it’s more complex than that.’

She added: ‘Mark gets me completely, and I get him. It’s refreshing, comfortable and easy. Some people don’t find that once in a lifetime. I’ve been fortunate to find it twice.

‘Having Mark in my life hasn’t changed the way I feel about Oz. He is always in my heart and spiritually he’s always by my side.’

Mrs Schmid, who lives in a £500,000 detached house in rural Hampshire, has just published her memoir Always By My Side about her life with her husband, whom she described as her ‘soulmate and best friend’.She says she actually completed the book a year ago and then felt ready ‘to move on to the next chapter of my life’.

Hero: Oz was awarded the George Cross after his death for defusing more than 60 defusing bombs

Brave and proud: Christina gave a thumbs up as she waited for Oz's body to be repatriated in November 2009

The widow met Mr Clarke, who had just returned from serving in Afghanistan, in a coffee shop last autumn. The attraction was instant and they spoke for two hours before parting, having exchanged phone numbers.

Mrs Schmid, who accepted the George Cross on her late husband’s behalf, said she believes he would have liked her new partner ‘very much’ and added: ‘We did have a discussion once, Oz and I, about how he’d feel about me meeting someone new.

‘He said, “If anything happens to me, honey, you and Laird have got each other, and nothing can break that. But if you meet someone who will look after you, then that’s lovely”. So I feel I have his blessing.’

Mrs Schmid and Mr Clarke are now discussing having a blessing to symbolise their commitment to each other and ‘new start’ to their friends and relatives. But it is too soon to say if they will marry.

‘Mark is a big part of my life,’ she added. ‘But at the same time I am a widow and I am aware that I have to be dignified. I have my closest friends to consider, many of whom are also Oz’s dearest friends. Whoever comes into my life must be able to get on with them. Luckily, Mark has. I feel that, in some ways, I have been pigeonholed as a grieving widow and campaigner – and don’t get me wrong, I was that woman. But I achieved what I set out to achieve, and now I want to move forward. I want to leave that woman in the past and look to the future.’

Mrs Schmid bought her new home, in its own grounds with a stream running alongside, eight months ago when she moved out of Army accommodation. It is understood she and Laird live there with frequent visits from Mr Clarke – the couple are often seen walking her late husband’s dog in the countryside.

A neighbour said: ‘They seem very happy.  Is she pregnant? I don’t know but I think she has said she would like more children one day.’

The full interview with Mrs Schmid is in the current issue of Hello! magazine.

My first call was to my mother. ‘Oh no, no, not Oz. Oh my God, you knew . . .’ she wailed.Over
the next few hours I called Oz’s family and friends. When I finished, I
launched the phone across the room and smashed the base. I was 
screaming ‘no’ and shaking uncontrollably. 

People
came and went. The night passed in a blur but I still remember it 
vividly — the flashbacks of that night still happen to this day.

Later, I’d discover that Oz had been killed while trying to defuse his third IED of the morning. Colonel Bob Seddon, who led the technical investigation, showed me photographs of Oz kneeling over the device that killed him. 

The
pictures had been taken a few moments before the explosion. There was a
compound wall in the background, and wires poking out of the ground a 
few yards in front of it. Oz was deep in concentration. 

The
next photographs of the same spot showed a crater with scraps of burned
paper lying about — the remains of letters and photos that Oz had 
tucked into his body armour. 

Grim
as the details were, I wanted to know the full story of my husband’s 
death. But no witness could say for sure why the IED had exploded.

My
own belief is that it may have been detonated by remote control. Oz was
always so careful — he once said to me: ‘I deal with every device as 
though you and Laird are on the end of it. That’s how I keep my focus.’
