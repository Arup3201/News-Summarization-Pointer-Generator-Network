Less a television programme, more a way of life, Match of the Day has played a special part in millions of people’s lives for the past 50 years. Including mine.

And, as we celebrate the anniversary of its first programme, it is worth reflecting how a simple but brilliant format then remains a ‘simply brilliant’ format now.

Famous face: Jimmy Hill made more than 600 appearances on Match of the Day as presenter and analyst

From its instantly recognisable theme tune, to its famous cast of presenters, pundits and commentators, it has tracked a remarkable football journey that spans from Ramsey to Rooney.

The biggest star is the action itself; the football has always come first, the talking after that, a principle the programme has stuck to down the years.

And despite wall-to-wall live football, Match of the Day remains the most famous brand in televised sport.

By the late 1970s I was a starry-eyed assistant producer on the programme. On my first Saturday, I had a bit of lunch in the BBC canteen to settle my ‘pre-match’ nerves and found myself sharing a table with Carry On star Hattie Jacques and a green and purple alien straight off the Dr Who set. He had egg and chips, then went off to conquer the universe.

A decade later I was editor of Match of the Day, helping drive the programme’s agenda. We strived to provide the first and most informed analysis of the day’s events.

On April 15, 1989, that desperate day of the Hillsborough Disaster, I fought to keep our programme in the schedules so we could relay the developing story through our own experienced broadcasters, Desmond Lynam and Jimmy Hill, who had both been there that afternoon. I remain proud of that programme but wish it had never needed to be made.

Where the show’s football opinions led, others followed. And with Lynam, the incomparable Hill, freshly retired Alan Hansen and future star presenter, Gary Lineker, in the pundits’ chairs, life was never dull.

On one typically frantic afternoon, a producer scribbled down instructions for post-match reactions. One was for the BBC director at Wimbledon, who had just beaten Liverpool.

‘Get me an interview with Vinnie Jones and ROY Kinnear!’ it read. The Crazy Gang’s actual manager, Joe Kinnear, was obviously more difficult to get hold of than the late, much-loved British comedian!

On Monday mornings I would often field a phone call or two from irate managers who felt their team had been treated unfairly. And to this day, fans don’t like their team being featured last.

The show itself only came about because, in the early 1960s, BBC’s ambitions to carry live league and cup football were repeatedly thwarted by football authorities. Football League chief Alan Hardaker was concerned the game would be damaged by over-exposure on TV. Ironically, now one pump primes the other.

A deal was finally struck and a fee of £20,000 was agreed for 36 ‘highlights’ matches, and the new series’ home was to be the fledgling BBC2, then only broadcasting in London.

When the first programme went on air at 6.30pm on Saturday, August 22, the 47,620 crowd at Anfield that had watched champions Liverpool beat Arsenal 3-2 in ‘Beatleville’, as commentator, Kenneth Wolstenholme regaled us, was more than watched the TV show.

A black cat ran across the pitch that day. A lucky omen for the new programme? Reviews were mixed. One TV critic claimed: ‘It looks like a proper clanger to me. The real sporting breakthrough on TV will come when pay TV arrives.’

Well, half right, because despite the proliferation of live football, Match of the Day still thrives, this season with some new faces but an established format.

As one’s own life-cycle spins, I have found myself with two young sons hiding behind the settee waiting for it to start. And, as the years have flown past, we all now share a beer before settling down to watch Lineker introduce the action.

On Saturday night, we’ll raise a glass to Match of the Day — a show with a clock that just keeps ticking
