She might be well into her 80s but time seems to have had little effect on Carmen Dell'Orefice's striking looks.

Posing next to a photo taken in the 1950s, the model cut an elegant figure in a floor-length black dress as she helped to launch the Victoria and Albert Museum's newest exhibition.

Horst: Photographer of Style opens on Saturday and includes 250 of his stunning fashion photographs including, unsurprisingly, plenty of Dell'Orefice herself.

Born in 1931, Dell'Orefice started modelling aged 15 in 1947 and has since gone on to star on countless covers and in scores of campaigns, among them Rolex and Isaac Mizrahi.

During her lengthy career, she also worked with some of the greatest photographers of the 20th Century, among them Irving Penn and German-born Vogue favourite, Horst P. Horst.

Horst, a man who racked up a record 90 Vogue covers over the course of his lengthy career, was famous for his work in haute couture - and for the surrealist touches he loved.

The photographer, real name Horst Paul Albert Bohrmann, was born in Weißenfels-an-der-Saale but worked predominantly in Paris and New York.

Iconic: This photo, the Mainbocher Corset, was taken in 1939 and is one of the 20th Century's most iconic shots

'Horst was one of the greatest photographers of fashion and 
society,' explains Martin Roth, director of the V&A.

'He produced some of the most famous and evocative images of the
 20th century. This exhibition will shine a light on all aspects of his long and distinguished career.'

One of his most famous images, and one 
of the most iconic photos of the 20th Century, is the Mainbocher Corset, which was taken in Vogue’s Paris studio in 1939.

Although 
he died in 1999, the late photographer remains a source of inspiration 
for designers and photographers today, most notably Donna Karan.

While Karan's work doesn't make an appearance, exquisite images of Chanel, 
Schiaparelli and Vionnet collections taken in 1930s Paris do, as do surrealist works taken a decade later.

After moving to
 New York in the 1940s, Horst experimented with early colour techniques 
and his meticulously composed, artfully-lit images leapt from the 
magazine page.

But while Horst is most famous for his fashion work, he also produced stunning documentary photos, including nature shots and others of people living in the Middle East.

Along with these, the exhibition also includes original
 contact sheets, sketches and archive film footage, as well as previously unseen photos.

Horst: Photographer of Style opens on 6th September and runs until 4th January 2015. For more
