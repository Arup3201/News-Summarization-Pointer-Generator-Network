Following Monday's record-breaking child prostitution sweep, the FBI revealed that earlier stings had targeted huge sporting events and major tourist attractions.

Ronald Hosko, assistant director of the agency's criminal investigative division, said that teen sex slaves had also been 
recovered at occasions such as NCAA Final Four and 
the Super Bowl.

In the 1990s, gangs took control of street 
prostitution across America; that forced pimps to move girls into 
sporting events where security existed, said Dr. Lois Lee.

Lee is founder and 
president of Children of the Night, a nonprofit group that has rescued 
10,000 children from prostitution since 1979.

Authorities also said that teen sex slaves have worked at prominent tourist areas in the U.S. such as Atlantic City in New Jersey.

Declaring child prostitution a 'persistent threat' in America, the FBI said Monday that authorities had rescued 105 young people and arrested 150 alleged pimps in a three-day sweep in 76 cities.

The young people in the roundup, almost all of them girls, ranged in age from 13 to 17. This was the the largest child sex trafficking sting in U.S. history.

The largest numbers of children rescued in the weekend initiative, Operation Cross Country, were in the San Francisco Bay and Detroit areas, along with Milwaukee, Denver and New Orleans.

The operation was conducted under the FBI's decade-long Innocence Lost National Initiative. The latest rescues and arrests were the largest such enforcement action to date.

'Child prostitution remains a persistent threat to children across the country,' Hosko told a news conference. 'We're trying to put this spotlight on pimps and those who would exploit.'

In Operation Cross Country, federal, state and local authorities cooperated in an intelligence effort aimed at identifying pimps and their young victims.

The FBI said the campaign has resulted in rescuing 2,700 children since 2003.

The investigations and convictions of 1,350 individuals have led to life imprisonment for 10 pimps and the seizure of more than $3.1 million in assets.

The FBI said 60 percent of the children rescued were in foster care or group homes when they ran away.

'With no way to survive on their own they are lured into a life of being trafficked for sex,' Hosko said.

Girls are enticed into the sex trade with compliments and offers of making money 'and then they are trapped in this cycle that involves drugs, it involves physical abuse, it may involve torture... so that they are tied to the pimp,' he said.

Hosko added: 'Commonly they don't see law enforcement as their friends' but rather as a threat of arrest.

To identify victims of sex 
trafficking, agents went undercover in major cities and posed as
men looking for sex. They also used Backpage, a website that is used to sell girls for sex.

Alex left home at the age of 16 and was sucked into prostitution because she couldn't afford to eat.

'At first it was terrifying, and then you just kind of become numb to it,' she told the FBI. 'I felt empty. You are at the bottom of the bottom. And you have nobody to go to... for help or for a hug. There’s nobody.'

After two years on the streets, Alex reached out to the FBI, which helped her get back on her feet and arrested the 'pimps' involved in trafficking her - Sacramento residents Tynisha Marie Hornbuckle and Tamrell Rena Hornbuckle. As a result of their crimes, Tynisha was sentenced to 15 years in prison and Tamrell was sentenced to 12 years in prison.

Alex has since earned her high school diploma and she plans to attend college.

Offering her advice to other victims of child sex trafficking, she said, 'They can take everything from you; your voice, your freedom, they can take your fight and will, your everything. But you cannot ever let them take your heart; you have to always keep fighting.'

'Many
times the children that are taken in in these types of criminal 
activities are children that are disaffected, they are from broken 
homes, they may be on the street themselves,' FBI Acting Executive 
Assistant Director Kevin Perkins said. 'They are really looking for a 
meal, they are looking for shelter, they are looking for someone to take
care of them.'

Overall, 47 FBI divisions took part in the raids, dubbed 'Operation Cross Country VII,' along with more than 3,900 local, state, and federal law enforcement officers and agents representing 230 separate agencies.

Taking place over the course of three days in 76 cities, it is the largest ever enforcement action against child sex trafficking in the U.S. The suspects who were arrested will likely face both federal and state charges of trafficking.

The Justice Department estimates that nearly 450,000 children run away from home each year,  one-third of whom will be lured into prostitution within 48 hours of leaving home.

That was the case with Alex, a woman who left home at the age of 16 and joined a prostitution ring because she couldn't afford to eat.

Alex, now 21, says life as a child prostitute was 'terrifying.'

'At
first it was terrifying, and then you just kind of become numb to it,' 
she said. 'Not like an alter ego but just like a different person, you 
put on a whole different attitude - I felt empty. You are at the bottom 
of the bottom. And you have nobody to go to... for help or for a hug. 
There’s nobody.'

After two years of sexual exploitation, Alex contacted the FBI for help. The information that she provided helped the agency nab two pimps and rescue several other victims.

Alex has since earned her high school diploma and she plans to attend college. Without the help of the FBI, she said she 'probably would have ended up dead.'

Offering her advice to other victims of child sex trafficking, she said, 'They can take everything from you; your voice, your freedom, they can take your fight and will, your everything. But you cannot ever let them take your heart; you have to always keep fighting.'

'Bad things happen, worse things than what have happened to us, all over the world, and people seem to keep going through it and living on and living life,' she added. 'The important thing is to try and turn every negative into a positive and make something good out of it.'
