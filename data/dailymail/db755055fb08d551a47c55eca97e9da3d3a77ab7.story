The man, who used a false name in the clip, is believed to have lived in Leyton, east London. But but it is unclear whether he ever had trials with Arsenal or any other association with the club.

Arsenal have made it clear they do not recognise the man, nor do they have any record of his 'representing the club at any level'

Extremist: The man claimed in an extremist video to be a former Arsenal footballer now fighting in Syria

Sources told The Guardian they do not believe he was a full-time player but he may have attended coaching sessions when potential players are assessed.

A spokesman for the club said: 'We do not recognise the individual from the published clips and we don't have any record of this man representing the club at any level.'

False rumours had spread that he was former Premier League football star Lassana Diarra, 29, who played for a number of Premier League clubs including Arsenal, Chelsea and Portsmouth, as well as spanish giants Real Madrid.

As a result, Diarra - who now plays for Lokomotiv Moscow in Russia - was forced to deny claims that he had become an Islamic warrior fighting in Syria, saying he had never set foot in the war-torn country.

The footage, which appeared two weeks ago and is apparently shot in Syria, shows the man calling on 
Muslims in the West to travel to the war-torn region and fight with 
radical militants.

The man, whose face is hidden by a balaclava and is seen clutching an AK47 rifle, is identified as Abu Isa al-Andalus.

According to FiSyria.com, the site 
that posted the video, the man moved to London from his native country 
to play for Arsenal after growing up alongside a world-famous 
footballer.

It claims 
the man was radicalised in the capital two years ago before 'leaving 
everything' to join the Al Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of Iraq and 
Syria (ISIS).

He later adds: 'We have conquered 
many cities and we are now implementing the Sharia. We have areas where 
the kaffirs (non-Muslims) are paying us the tax.

'If we stay in the kaffir countries we have to pay (taxes) to them. Do you want to be humiliated by this? Think about it.

'If
 you have family in these (Western) countries it's a must for you to put
 your children in the kaffir schools. "Who is going to teach your 
children?" It's going to maybe be a gay, maybe a drug dealer, maybe a 
paedophile.

'It's very important for you to protect your children. Allah says they are the worst of creatures.'

The
 Russian-based website does not confirm the man's previous identity on 
the page, which shows two videos each roughly four-minutes long.
