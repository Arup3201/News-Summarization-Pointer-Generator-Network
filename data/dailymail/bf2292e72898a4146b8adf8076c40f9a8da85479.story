The stage musical of 'The Lion
King' has generated the highest total box office of any
production in any entertainment medium, with worldwide takings
of more than $6.2billion, a spokesman for Walt Disney Co
 said on Monday.

The musical, which has been running on Broadway since 1997
and has been playing around the world, has exceeded the takings
of the animated film of the same name, which are almost $1billion.

'It is the highest-grossing total in box office history,' a
spokesman said. 'The $6.2 billion figure is just the box
office of the stage musical.'

Popular: The Lion King musical has generated the highest total box office of any production or entertainment medium, Disney announced on Monday

Hit: The musical has been running on Broadway since 1997, and is based off the hit animated film of the same name

The spokesman said the show had reached the new record
during the summer.

'The Lion King,' based on the 1994 animated Disney film of
the same name, follows the journey of Simba, a young lion born
into animal royalty. When Simba is ousted into the wild by his
evil uncle, he overcomes adversity with the help of his jungle
friends to reclaim his crown as king of African wildlife.

Directed by Julie Taymor, the musical features songs by
Elton John and lyrics from Tim Rice.

'It's difficult not to become emotional at this realization
of the show's impact,' said Thomas Schumacher, president and
producer at Disney Theatrical Productions.

The total makes 'The Lion King' more valuable than any
single Harry Potter film, the blockbuster 'Titanic' or any of
the 'Star Wars' movies. 

By way of comparison, the
highest-grossing film in history is 'Avatar,' with nearly $2.8billion worldwide, according to Disney. 

Bank: The original Lion King movie made $1billion in sales, but that's nothing compared to the $6.2billion in ticket money the musical has brought in
