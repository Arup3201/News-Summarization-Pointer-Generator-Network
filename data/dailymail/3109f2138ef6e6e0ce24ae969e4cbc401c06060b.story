Family and friends of the teenage boy who was shot to death by his girlfriend's father after sneaking into her bedroom are demanding that the girlfriend be charged with accessory to murder or involuntary manslaughter.

A group of the 17-year-old Johran McCormick's supporters, including his mother Zakia McCormick and community activist Quanell X, rallied on Wednesday morning outside the home near Houston, Texas where authorities say the teenager was killed on March 13.

Investigators have said McCormick's 16-year-old girlfriend let him into the house on Bridgestone Ridge Dr. in Spring, Texas.

Family and friends of 17-year-old Johran McCormick say they want his girlfriend and her father to face charges for their role in his death

The girl's 55-year-old father, who has not been identified, told police that one of his four children woke him at about 2.30am to tell him someone was inside their house.

The girl initially told her father that she did not know the boy, prompting the father to call 911 and leading to an argument between McCormick and the father.

As the teen motioned as if he was reaching for something, the father shot him in the head, killing him.

The girl later admitted that she knew the boy and had let him inside the home.

The teen was not armed, according to authorities.

The father, who was brought from the house on a stretcher, was hospitalized with panic attack symptoms, according to reports.

A grand jury will determine whether the father should be charged.

McCormick's supporters are calling for the girlfriend to be charged with either one or two counts of accessory to murder or involuntary manslaughter for lying to her father about knowing Cormick and letting him into the home, according to KHOU.

The teen's father, Shawn Curley, faulted both the father and the girl for his son's death.

'I wish the father could have asked more questions, he could have picked up the phone,' Curley told the Houston Chronicle last month. 'And for her to say she didn't know who he was, that was most hurtful.'

A legal expert told the newspaper that the grand jury decision on whether to charge the father will be based on what the dad believed at the time of the shooting.

'If it's perceived that there is a "stranger" in his home, there could be a viable claim of self-defense or defense of others,' said Harris County Criminal Lawyers Association president Todd Dupont.

Zakia McCormick and community activist Quanell X were among those who rallied outside the home where the boy died, calling for charges to be filed
