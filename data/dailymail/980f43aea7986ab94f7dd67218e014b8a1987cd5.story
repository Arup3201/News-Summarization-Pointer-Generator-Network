The father of a five-year-old girl who was thrown to her death off a 60-foot bridge in Tampa Bay has been charged with murder.

John Jonchuck Jr, 25, was arrested half an hour after a man was seen speeding towards a bridge and throwing a child 60ft into the water on Wednesday night.

Rescuers found Phoebe Jonchuk 40 minutes later but she could not be resuscitated.

It has since emerged Mr Jonchuk was interviewed by police earlier that day after 'acting strangely' in a meeting with his attorney to discuss Phoebe's custody - calling the lawyer 'God' then asking her to read the Bible in Swedish.

Mr Jonchuk separated from Phoebe's mother Michelle Kerr, who has MS, following six tumultuous years together - during which police were called numerous times for domestic violence issues. Both had arrest records.

Jonchuk has had full custody of Phoebe since. Last month he filed a restraining order against Kerr last month, which was denied.

With no fixed abode, the father and daughter have been living with John Jonchuk Sr for two months.

But at midnight last night Jonchuk was allegedly seen speeding at 100mph in a PT Cruiser toward the Sunshine Skyway bridge, according to a police report.

The officer who spotted the Cruiser gave chase and saw the driver reach the top of Dick Misener Bridge then enter the approach to the Skyway.

The car was then seen to stop and a figure emerged, throwing a child over the side of the rail into the water off Boca Ciega Bay.

The officer said he heard the girl scream as she fell.

Jonchuk returned to the car and drove south but was stopped by Manatee County authorities about 30 minutes later.

He was arrested and has been charged with first-degree murder.

Jonchuk also faces charges of aggravated assault with a motor vehicle on a law enforcement officer and aggravated fleeing and eluding police.

The girl was found 40 minutes later by divers from Eckerd College and attempts were made to resuscitate her. She was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead and her mother was informed.

At Jonchuk's first hearing on Thursday, Pinellas County Judge Michael Andrews asked him if he wanted an attorney.

'I want to leave it in the hands of God,' Jonchuck said. 

The judge responded: 'I'm pretty sure God's not going to be representing you in this case. You're going to be standing trial.' 

Details have since emerged of Jonchuk's 'strange' behavior on Wednesday that prompted his attorney Genevieve Torres to contact police.

Torres said she met with John Jonchuck on Wednesday to discuss the custody case for his five-year-old daughter, Phoebe.

After their meeting, she was so worried about the father and daughter that she reported the odd statements to police.

Officers interviewed Jonchuck and his daughter as he was picking her up from a church day care and both appeared to be in good health. Jonchuck said he didn't want to harm himself or anyone else, the documents said.

'She was smiling and appeared healthy, properly clothed and happy,' according to the documents.

A little more than twelve hours later, police said Jonchuck threw his daughter over a bridge.

Kerr said she last saw her daughter and Jonchuck on Christmas Eve. They had a nice evening together and then he called child protective services on her and made false abuse allegations, she said.

'He does the Jekyll and Hyde. It's just something that goes on in his head, he just wasn't wired right,' she said.

And yet, Kerr said that she never imagined Jonchuck would hurt Phoebe. 

Jonchuk's friend and former landlord Melody Dishman told Tampa Bay News she contacted police on Tuesday after receiving 'scary texts' from the 25-year-old calling her names he had 'found Jesus'. Officers told her to file for a restraining order.

Dishman said the father and daughter moved out three months ago to stay with Jonchuk's 57-year-old father, John Jonchuk Sr. 

During their two-month stay, she claimed, Jonchuk shouted at Phoebe and locked her in her room.

'She didn't want to be around John. I could see it in her eyes,' Dishman said, but added: 'I would never think that he would have hurt her.'

Police spokesman Yolanda Fernandez said: 'It's unfathomable I mean and officers see all kinds of things but it's still very difficult to see something like this unfold before your eyes.

'What could make someone throw someone over a railing, let alone your own child? How could you possibly understand that?'
