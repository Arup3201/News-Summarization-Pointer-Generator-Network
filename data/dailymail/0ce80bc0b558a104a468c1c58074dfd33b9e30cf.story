Announcement: Carla Bruni is to finally release her next album of songs after 'years of unhappiness' as First Lady of France, her agent revealed today

Mr de Labbey added: 'She suffered from not being able to do her job as a songwriter while she lived at the Elysee palace.

'But she made a choice. She chose a man she loves and she is happy with him.

'She was never a political woman, so she never had the thick skin she needed, and she was always very, very sensitive to all the attacks on her husband.

'In fact she took it all very badly, and after a certain point she became an unhappy woman.

Past albums:  Bruni's last 2008 album Comme Si De Rien N'itait, left, sold only 90,000 copies last year, and her music is virtually unknown outside France.  Right her album - No Promises

'But she has now written a beautiful 
new album, and I hope the critics will be able to look beyond her past 
as First Lady and see it's true artistic qualities.'

Bruni, 45, hinted recently that she had no wish for Sarkozy to bid for a second term as president.

She said: 'I don't really want to talk about that. The press was deplorable with my husband and very agressive with him.

'The level of criticism and lies reached incredible levels. But I suppose that's the freedom of the press for you.

'The Elysee Palace was a world which opened my mind and my spirit, but ultimately it wasn't my world.'

Bruni's last 2008 album Comme Si De Rien N'itait sold only 90,000 copies last year, and her music is virtually unknown outside France.

Future: Bruni, 45, hinted recently that she had no wish for Sarkozy to bid for a second term as president

She was humiliated after its release when she failed to receive a single nomination at the French equivalant of the Brit Awards.

French music critic Gerard Delapont said at the time: 'Technically her music has very little merit, and she doesn't sing, she just mumbles.

'Her fame as a First Lady was always greater than her talent as a singer.'
