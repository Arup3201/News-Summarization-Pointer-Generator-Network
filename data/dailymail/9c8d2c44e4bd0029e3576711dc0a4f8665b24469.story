Breel Embolo will be the centre of attention at Anfield on Tuesday night should Basle decide to throw him in against Liverpool.

The 17-year-old Cameroon-born forward has taken time off school to be with the Swiss side for their Champions League decider and more than 20 scouts are expected to be in attendance to see how he and his team-mates fare.

Manchester United, City, Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid have already been alerted to the teenager's potential while Borussia Dortmund and Wolfsburg have watched him since he was 13.

Born on Valentine’s Day 1997, Embolo has quickly materialised as the object of affection for many a Basle fan. 'I love everything about him,' says coach Paulo Sousa.

An exciting prospect who can play in attack or midfield, he is blessed with pace, power and skill. Sousa has already trusted him to lead the attack against Real Madrid and he caused consternation for Raphael Varane and Sergio Ramos.

He started against Liverpool in Basle's 1-0 victory in Switzerland and became the sixth youngest scorer in Champions League history when he registered in the 4-0 win over Ludogorets last month.

Although he was born in Cameroon, Embolo moved to Switzerland when he was six. He has been on Basle’s books for four years since joining from neighbouring Old Boys.

Embolo started in the home game against Liverpool, which Basle won 1-0, and is in line to play again

The 17-year-old has been involved in all five of Basle's Champions League group games so far

He made his senior debut in March as a substitute in the Europa League match with Red Bull Salzburg and scored his first senior goal in his next game, a 5-0 defeat of Aarau.

This season he has six goals in 16 games all scored with a range of skills exhibiting ingenuity, deftness and opportunism. Basle know they have an asset on their hands. How long they keep him will be determined by who wants to pay the asking price.

Those who ask have been told it will take £7m to £10m to prise away the livewire teenager who is now a Swiss U21 star.

It is not just Europe's super powers who are watching though. Everton have been told of his prowess by Samuel Eto'o, while Tottenham, Newcastle, Southampton will all be represented at Anfield.

In their favour, if they can pay the money, is the greater opportunity to make their first team. That will be instrumental should Embolo choose England.

A lesson is in progress with Mohamed Salah at Chelsea. Basle's star player last year made the leap to the Premier League but is now looking to go on loan frustrated by the time he has played at Stamford Bridge. 

For Embolo that could prove stifling for a talent that promises much.
