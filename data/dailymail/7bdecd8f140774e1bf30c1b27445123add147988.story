Said (left) and Cherif (right) Kouachi grew up in a specialist boarding school in the tourist village of Treignac after their parents both died

A former teacher of the brothers who attacked a magazine office in Paris said the boys were more interested in football than religion at school but were too dim-witted to avoid extremists after they left.

Said, 34, and Cherif Kouachi, 32, murdered 12 people in central Paris last week before fleeing to a print works where they were shot by armed police while saying they were ready to 'die as martyrs.'

But a former teacher who helped to raise the orphaned pair at a school in the holiday village of Treignac recalls them as happy, popular and trustworthy children who had little interest in religion.

Said and Cherif, who are of French-Algerian descent, were sent to the Monedieres centre in the picturesque Mastiff region in 1994 by their mother, who was unable to raise them after their father died suddenly.

Once at the boarding school, which specialises is raising children with social needs, they were largely isolated from the outside world.

There they took up sports, showing a passion for football, while also taking regular lessons.

Francoise Ronfet, a retired biology teacher from the school, grew particularly fond of Cherif. He was not especially bright, she said, but showed a willingness to learn.

She had fewer dealings with Said, Cherif's older brother, but said his level of intellect was 'low'. She said that she noticed Said praying but that religion did not form a large part of his upbringing.

While the boys were in school their mother died and when the time came for them to leave at age 18 they had no family to return to.

Instead they moved together to a council apartment in Paris's poor 19th arrondissement where they fell into a life of drug dealing and petty crime before being taken in by the Buttes Chaumont gang.

Francoise Ronfet, a former teacher at the school, recalled Cherif (left) as a well behaved boy who loved football and didn't practice religion. She said his brother Said (right) had a 'low' intellect and prayed occasionally

When the brothers left the isolated school they returned to Paris where they were taken in by an extremist gang

The group, which also included Deli attacker Amedy Coulibaly, 32, was lead by two radical Imams who preached jihad.

Speaking about Cherif's move to Paris, Ms Ronfet told The Times: 'He joined up with little groups of hooligans. They ran rings around him because he was relatively fragile and allowed himself to be led by the nose.

'I think it's from then on that he started spending time in the mosques. But when he was at college in Treignac he had nothing to do with religion. I don't think he was a practising Muslim.

Farid Benyettou, a janitor-turned-preacher who lead the Buttes Chaumont gang  is the extremist preacher credited with radicalising the Kouachis 

'As for his brother, Said, his level of intellect was very low. I think he used to pray. When I saw the photos on the TV, I was really very surprised the boys turned out like that.'

It was a cleric named Farid Benyettou, a janitor-turned-preacher, who was responsible for radicalising the boys, teaching that waging jihad was a way to get closer to God.

Both of the brothers were questioned in 2005 over their links to the Buttes Chaumont gang after it began sending groups of young men to Iraq who never returned.

Neither of them were formally charged but in 2008 Cherif was brought back to court after he was caught trying to get on a flight to Damascus with an operating manual for an AK-47.

Cherif, who had married a woman named Izzana Hamyd the same year, was sent to jail for three years, though he only served 18 months before being released.

While inside he began working out and met another radical cleric named Djamel Beghal, who had previously attended the Finsbury Park mosque Abu Hamza preached at.

After being freed from prison, Cherif was photographed by French intelligence visiting Beghal in Murat in central France in April 2010.

Despite his radically altered persona, it seems he never lost his childhood passion for football, as he was also videoed kicking a ball around with three suspected extremists.

Later that year, Cherif was arrested for a third time over a plot to break Smain Ali Belkacem out of jail after he was imprisoned for life over the bombing of a Paris railway station in 1995.

Police papers filed at the time also make mention of Said, though officers later decided there was not enough evidence to charge the pair.

Another member of Buttes Chaumont was Amedy Coulibaly, 32, who shot a policewoman dead in Paris the day after the Koouachis attacked, before killing four more in a Jewish supermarket

Little is known about what became of the brothers between that date and last week's massacre at the offices of Charlie Hebdo. 

French security sources have suggested that the brothers could have been in Syria as recently as last year, while it is also thought the pair could have travelled to Yemen where they received military training while serving with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

Cherif is believed to have had at least one child in that time. Said married Soumya Bouarfa in Paris in March 2012 and has at least two children.
