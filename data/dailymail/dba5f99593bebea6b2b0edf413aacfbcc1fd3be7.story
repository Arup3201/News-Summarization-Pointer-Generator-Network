Never mind those little blue pills – men who have problems between the sheets could reinvigorate themselves simply by eating a Mediterranean diet.

Eating fish, salads and olive oil, and enjoying the odd glass of wine, could transform the lives of men suffering from impotence, according to Greek cardiologist Athanasios Angelis.

He said his research had shown that consuming such healthy foods helped clean out blood vessels, especially the narrow ones in the penis that are essential for a man to perform.

Dr Angelis, an expert on erectile dysfunction at Hippokration Hospital in Athens, said: ‘The Mediterranean diet is well known to be a healthy diet, one that is associated with longevity, wellbeing, lower incidence of cancer and cardiovascular disease.

‘And this is very important, because people can choose this type of diet to prevent or restore their vascular health.’ 

He explained that when a man had problems achieving an erection, ‘it can be a sign of worse health problems to come’, because the blood vessels in the penis were ‘very, very sensitive’ to what was happening in the rest of the body.

‘Adopting a healthy diet and lifestyle can help reverse moderate erectile dysfunction,’ Dr Angelis said.

Changing to a Mediterranean diet, and taking more exercise, could be so effective in some men that they would not have to rely on Viagra any longer, he added.

‘What those pills do is substitute substances that can’t be produced in the body due to poor vascular health. They help restore a proper vascular response. But if we can restore vascular function by adopting a healthy lifestyle, we can reverse at least the first stages of the disease without drugs.’

He recommended plenty of cereals, fruit and vegetables, salads, nuts, olive oil, fish and poultry – but no kebabs. Red meat, once per week, is enough, he said. He also recommended two or three small glasses of wine a day.

Dr Angelis presented the research at a meeting of the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging in Vienna.
