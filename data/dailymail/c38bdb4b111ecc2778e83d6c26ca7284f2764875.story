NFL teams want to know if college star Manti Te'o is gay, with his sexual orientation being described as the 'elephant in the room' among professional franchises interested in signing him.

The Notre Dame linebacker has been the laughing stock of the sport since it was revealed he was duped into having an online relationship with a non-existent girlfriend.

But questions marks remain over whether the 22-year-old is homosexual and NFL teams considering signing the rising star in the Draft are said to want answers.

'Elephant in the room': NFL teams interested in signing Manti Te'o want to know if he is homosexual

Mike Florio, editor of Profootballtalk.com, told The Dan Patrick Show on Monday that Te'o's sexuality should not matter, but added that the NFL was a 'unique industry'.

He added: 'Teams want to know whether Manti Te’o is gay. They just want to know. They want to know because in an NFL locker room, it’s a different world. It shouldn’t be that way.

'It’s been described to me as the proverbial elephant in the room and I don't think anyone knows how to solve this dilemma yet. It’s just that they want to know what they’re getting. They want to know what issues they may be dealing with down the road.'

He also explained how the man who played the girlfriend hoax on Te'o, Ronaiah Tuiasosopo, has come out as gay and said it 'raises a lot of questions' that the NFL will eventually have to deal with.

Mr Florio added: 'I'm not saying anyone would take Manti Te’o off the board if they suspected he's gay or know he's gay. That's just the thing that's out there that they want to know the answer to.'

Te'o dominated this year's NFL Scouting Combine, a showcase of football's brightest talents, who are put through various mental and physical tests by interested teams ahead of the Draft.

Bright future: Te'o was one of the nation's most inspirational college football players

NFL prospect Nick Kasa has revealed that he was asked about his sexual orientation at the Combine.

The University of Colorado tight end said on ESPN Radio Denver that he was quizzed by scouts during interviews.

He said: '[Teams] ask you like, 'Do you have a girlfriend? Are you married? Do you like girls?'

'Those kinds of things, and you know it was just kind of weird. But they would ask you with a straight face, and it’s a pretty weird experience altogether.'

Homophobia has come to the fore in football following comments by San Francisco 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver before this year's Super Bowl.

He said days before the game that he did not 'do gay guys' and 'we don't got no gay people on the team, they gotta get up out of here if they do'.

Te'o, who has denied he is gay, took centre stage on Saturday at the Combine. The former Notre Dame linebacker explained how he had been 
duped into the Internet romance he had with a girlfriend he never met, as he did his best to turn the page on an embarrassing chapter by talking 
football.

The hoax has turned one of the nation's most 
inspirational college football players into the butt of national jokes.

Te'o's had produced incredible 
performances after learning his grandmother and what he believed was his
girlfriend had died within hours of one another in September.

Embarrassment: Notre Dame announced last month at a press conference that Te'o had been duped

He said
it inspired him to play his best football all season, and it was so 
compelling that it helped turn Te'o into a Heisman Trophy contender as
he was leading the Fighting Irish to an undefeated regular season and 
into the national championship game.

But in December. Te'o notified Notre Dame officials that he had received a
call from his supposedly dead girlfriend's phone three weeks earlier.

The school investigated and last month, after Deadspin.com broke the
story of the fake girlfriend, athletic director Jack Swarbrick 
announced at a news conference that Te'o had been duped.

Ronaiah 
Tuiasosopo, 22, later said he created the online persona of Lennay 
Kekua, a nonexistent woman who Te'o said he fell in love with despite 
never meeting her in person.
