Former Newcastle United midfielder Nolberto Solano has been offered the role of technical director at American youth team Ironbound Soul CL, who are based in New Jersey.

After a spell in charge of Universitario de Deportes in his native Peru, Solano has been working with academy players at Toronto International in Canada.

Now, the 39-year-old looks set for a new challenge, as he continues to pave out a worldly managerial career.

Solano worked under a number of experienced managers during his playing days, including Ruud Gullit, Sam Allardyce, Kenny Dalglish and of course, the late Sir Bobby Robson. 

Speaking to The Chronicle, Solano said: 'In football you can't learn too much.There is always a different way, or a different system or just a different way of thinking.

'I just try to use everything that I have learned from all my managers down the years. You take a little bit from all of them.' 

The former Peru captain was the first player from his country in the Premier League. The set-piece specialist joined Newcastle in 1998 and became a cult hero before leaving for Aston Villa six years later.

He only spent one season at Villa Park before heading back to St James' Park, where he spent another two seasons before joining West Ham for a campaign.

After leaving for Greece and a spell back in his native land, he came back to England and played for Leicester, Hull and Hartlepool.

While in the North East he was also coach of amateur side Newcastle Benfield.
