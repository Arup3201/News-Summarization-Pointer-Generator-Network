It may look like a remote-controlled car, but the world’s most expensive dune buggy is a serious feat of engineering.

Despite being built for tackling sandy dunes and beaches, the Sidewinder buggy has a top speed of 93 mph (150 kph).

It also has a pretty eye watering price tag, costing £157,000 (€199,000 or $246,289).

The ultimate boy's toy?The world’s most expensive dune buggy (illustrated) looks a little bit like a remote controlled car with its stylised design. Despite being built for tackling sandy dunes and beaches, the Sidewinder buggy has a top speed of 93 mph (150 kph)

Powered by a 630 brake horsepower engine, the sleek, gun-metal grey buggy goes from 0-60 mph in 4.4 seconds.

It is made by a Swedish company called Gray Designs, which designed it with robust suspension and a high-tech chassis to keep passengers comfortable while they are speeding down a steep Saharan dune.

‘The Sidewinder is designed to enjoy the hobby of sand dune racing in luxury and style,’ a spokesperson for Gray Designs said.

‘Whether it's in the Middle East or the US, the Sidewinder is the perfect vehicle to take you from dune to dune in comfort.’

Add to Christmas list? The Sidewinder buggy (illustrated) has a high price tag, costing £157,000 (€199,000 or $246,289), but contains a luxurious interior as well as the engineering required to propel it over sand dunes with ease

Maximum power: 630 brake horsepower at 6,400 rpm

Maximum torque: 600 Nm at 5,400 rpm

Acceleration: 0-60 mph in 4.2 seconds, or 1-100 kph in 5.5 seconds

Maximum speed: 93 mph (150kph)

The buggy can be ‘fine-tuned’ to suit individual customers’ needs, using an Android-based platform, the company said.

The Sidewinder is powered by an LSX Bowtie big block engine and supported by 3.0 King bypass shock absorbers.

For people without a spare £157,000 to blow on a buggy, Google has mapped a portion desert, enabling people to look across a vast expanse of desert dunes from the comfort of their sofas.

Two months ago, Google strapped its Trekker camera to the back of a camel so sandy scenes could be added to Street View.

Viewers can see glimmers of green in the distance of the Liwa Desert in the United Arab Emirates, which are often oases, but could also be a mirage.

Using the virtual map though the desert, people can climb sand dunes reaching towering heights of between 16ft and 147ft (5 and 45 metres).

The rolling sandy hills were once home to early settlers in the Late Stone Age, making Liwa one of the historic sites in the United Arab Emirates, according to a blog post by Deanna Yick, a Street View Program Manager.

Some of the richest history in this desert lies in the Liwa Oasis - the largest oasis in the Arabian Peninsula.

Many people from across the United Arab Emirates can trace their origins back to the first tribes who settled there and first established the area as a centre for trade. Dates are grown in the oases, and their fruit is important to local cultures.

Google gathered views of oasis plants and vast expanses of sand with beautiful patterns etched by the wind, by attaching one of its Trekkers to a camel, which gathered imagery as it walked.

The tech giant said that the use of camels allowed it to collect authentic images as well as minimally impact the environment.
