Restaurant customers tip more generously if the bill arrives in a heart-shaped dish, a new study has found.

Psychologists believe the symbolic shape generates feelings of love and compassion, which leads people to act more altruistically.

They said restaurant managers would be well-advised to use heart-shaped dishes as this could have benefits for both staff and customers.

Psychologists believe the symbolic shape generates feelings of love and compassion, which leads people to act more altruistically

The findings come from a study that compared tipping behaviour when customers were served the bill in either a round, square, or heart-shaped dish.

Lead author Professor Nicolas Gueguen, of the University of South Brittany, in France, said: ‘Customers gave tips more often to a waitress when the bill was placed in a dish with a cardioid (heart) shape and, when they did, they gave her a larger amount of money.

The heart shape has been used to express the idea that the heart is a person's centre of emotion and love for hundreds of years.

There are many theories as to how the symbol came about - some experts believe it is reminiscent of a person's lips or a female's genitalia.

Others, however, believe it took its original form from plants, more specifically the ivy leaf.

The symbol was first used in the Middle Ages but it was not widely recognised until the 16th century.

The 'scalloped' shape of the now-familiar heart symbol, with a dent in its base, first arose in the early 14th century, at first only slightly dented.

The red colour symbolises blood, passion and strong emotion.

‘This effect was found for both male and female patrons.

‘We can conclude that inducing love by the symbolic shape associated with this concept (the heart) is a strong technique to enhance people’s altruistic behaviour.’

The study, published online in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology, involved 365 customers and five waitresses working in three seafood restaurants in France.

Customers sat alone at a table to eat and the waitresses were told to always act in the same way and to serve the bill with the same words in a dish with two sweets.

The dishes were all red, of similar size and made by the same company, so all that changed was the shape.

Professor Gueguen found no difference in tipping behaviour in relation to the different waitresses and different restaurants.

But nearly half of people - 46 per 
cent - who got their bill in a heart-shaped dish tipped, compared to 31 
per cent who got a round dish, and 26 per cent who got a square dish.

Tips left in a heart-shaped dish were 1.38 euros on average, compared to 1.19 euros in a round dish and 1.17 euros in a square dish.

The difference was seen despite the fact that tipping in France is not expected because a 12 per cent service charge is added to prices listed on a menu.

‘Managers, then, should encourage these methods, in so far as they may create a greater state of fulfilment in the workplace for the employees,’ the authors concluded.

‘Furthermore, these methods may, in turn, result in much more contentment and satisfaction for the customer, thus encouraging the customer to come back or to recommend the restaurant.’
