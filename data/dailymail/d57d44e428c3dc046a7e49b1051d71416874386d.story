A couple of New Zealand men, who were desperate to move a fridge despite lacking ropes, were caught taking the saying 'when there's a will, there's a way' just one step too far.

One sure-footed West Auckland man was seen perching atop a black Nissan over the weekend while holding a large fridge in place on the roof of the vehicle. 

With no ropes to pin the fridge down and only thongs on his feet, the man stayed in place on the boot of the Nissan as a second man drove the car on Friday.

The photo, snapped by someone driving in a car behind the precarious movers, has gained over 600 likes and 300 shares on Facebook.

Since being shared on social media, the man balancing on the boot of the car, Daniel Jackson, has identified himself by commenting on the posts.

'Hae, this is me. We didn't have a rope and needed that fridge, but no dent incurred and we got it home safely,' Mr Jackson wrote in a comment below the picture.

Other Facebook users soon began berating the man, accusing him of putting both himself and other drivers at risk. 

The man later identified himself on social media when the image went viral, ignoring all the criticisms 

Earlier in the month, Australia's highway patrol officers shared images like this of some of the most questionable do-it-yourself delivery drivers on New South Wales' roads

'Well yous wouldn't want to see any other photos of things we have moved on a roof then lol,' Mr Jackson responded.

He later added: 'I was there to hold it so it wouldn't [fall and harm other motorists] and it was at most 1km up the road from Rosier Road to Leo Street and we were going no more than 20kph so calm down and see the lighter side guys'.

Despite his lack of concern, New Zealand police have condemned the dangerous behaviour while expressing interest in identifying and questioning the two men.

'The consequences of injury to this person and other road users as well as potential damage to other vehicles is obvious,' Inspector Scott Webb from the Waitakere police area command told the New Zealand Herald.

Earlier in the month, Australia's highway patrol officers shared their own photographs of some of the most questionable do-it-yourself delivery drivers on New South Wales' roads.

The page has since gone viral with more than 100,000 'fans' who have also shared some of their own snaps of reckless drivers, including an image of back-seat passengers doubling up as safety restraints as they hold on to beds attached to a car roof.
