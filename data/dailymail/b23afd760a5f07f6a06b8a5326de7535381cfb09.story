Police and security services have thwarted 40 terrorists plots in Britain since the July 7 attacks nine years ago, Theresa May revealed today.

The foiled atrocities including 'marauding' 'Mumbai-style' gun attacks streets, an attempt to blow up the London Stock Exchange and airplanes, and murder troops and a British ambassador.

Unveiling a raft of new counter-terror measures, the Home Secretary warned the threat to Britain is 'greater than it ever has been' and stressed the terrorists 'only have to be lucky once'.

Home Secretary Theresa May warned the threat to Britain is 'greater than it ever has been' and stressed the terrorists 'only have to be lucky once'

Mrs May said a new bill designed to tighten up protections against terror in the UK  would help to prevent radicalisation

The new Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill - designed to tighten up protections in the UK - will be rushed in the Houses of Commons on Wednesday.

Mrs May said it would help to prevent radicalisation, strengthen the TPIMs regime for controlling the movements of terror suspects and give greater powers to 'disrupt and control the movements of people who go abroad to fight'.

British companies will be banned from funding ransom payments and it will be made easier to track extremists on the internet.

Mrs May stressed the new laws are not a 'knee-jerk response to a sudden perceived threat'.

Instead she stressed that since taking office she has been briefed on hundreds of terror suspects 'intent on attacking Britain, the British people and our interests overseas'.

The Security Service believe that since the 7/7 attacks in 2005 – in which 52 people were killed by four bombers on London transport - around 40 terrorist plots have been disrupted, she said.

Mrs May added: 'There have been attempts to conduct marauding 'Mumbai-style' gun attacks on our streets, blow up the London Stock Exchange, bring down airliners, assassinate a British ambassador and murder serving members of our armed forces.

'Almost all of these attacks have been prevented by the first-class men and women of our security and intelligence services, the police, and our allies overseas.

'But as the IRA once boasted, the terrorists 'only have to be lucky once.'

In a speech to RUSI in central London, Mrs May announced the new Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill will be rushed in the Houses of Commons on Wednesday

Key measures announced by Home Secretary Theresa May include:

Last year, Drummer Lee Rigby was murdered in broad daylight by Islamist extremists in London, while Mohammed Saleem, an 82-year old British Muslim from Birmingham, was murdered by a Ukrainian far right extremist who then tried to bomb mosques in Walsall, Wolverhampton and Tipton, Mrs May added.

'The terrorists who committed these cowardly acts are now where they belong, behind bars serving life sentences.

'But since the attacks they carried out, the threat we face from terrorism has grown more serious.'

Yesterday, Scotland Yard commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe disclosed that 'four or five' plots have been foiled this year.

Up and down the country, officers will be briefing more than 6,000 people at 80 venues including schools, universities, airports, shopping centres, cinemas and farms in a bid to engage the public and businesses in preventing attacks.

The terror threat level in the UK was raised from substantial to severe a few months ago against a backdrop of increasing concerns over hundreds of aspiring British jihadis travelling to Iraq and Syria to learn terrorist 'tradecraft'. 

Since April 2010, 753 people have been arrested for terrorism-related offences, 212 have been charged and 148 have been successfully prosecuted, she said.

A total of 138 people are behind bars serving sentences for terrorism-related offences, Mrs May added, while 13 people, including hook-handed radical cleric Abu Hamza, have been extradited.

The Counter-Terrorism Internet Referral Unit has removed 65,000 items from the internet that 'encouraged or glorified acts of terrorism', the Home Secretary said. 

Since the July 7 attacks in 2005, around 40 terror plots have been disrupted, Mrs May revealed

Pakistani gunman  Ajmal Kasab brought terror to Mumbai in 2008 as part of a group of almost 30 attackers which rampaged through the streets of India's financial capital for three days, killing 166 people

Scotland Yard's Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley warned the terror threat will last for years

The extremist threat to Britain will continue even if the violence in Syria and Iraq subsides, according to a senior police chief.

Scotland Yard's Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley stressed that the terror threat comes from many parts of the world. 

Asked if the current terror climate would continue for at least five years, Mr Rowley said: 'We have seen a step change that will sustain for many years.

'Even if the awfulness that's happening in Syria and Iraq was miraculously to get sorted in the next year or so - and that looks a very optimistic 'if' - there are other countries across parts of Africa and elsewhere in the world which are in parlous states and the potential for this type of terrorism to reach back into Europe to continue in other theatres is equally great.

'Whether it continues in that theatre or whether it moves into other places I think there's a high prospect of it continuing in this nature for several years.' 

Mrs May conceded that it is not possible to 'entirely eliminate the threat from terrorism', but it was necessary to act to 'reduce the risk presented by our enemies'.

She went on: 'We are engaged in a struggle that is fought on many fronts and in many forms. It is a struggle that will go on for many years.

'And the threat we face right now is perhaps greater than it ever has been and we must have the powers we need to defend ourselves.'

Under the new laws, schools, prisons and councils are to be required by law to put in place measures to stop would-be extremists from being drawn into terrorism.

A statutory duty will be placed on named organisations - such as colleges, universities, the police and probation providers - to help deter radicalisation and, where organisations fail, ministers will be able to issue court-enforced directions to them.

Over the weekend it emerged that police are to be handed powers in the new bill to force internet firms to hand over details that could help identify suspected terrorists and paedophiles.

The Counter-Terrorism Bill will oblige internet service providers (ISPs) to retain information linking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to individual users.

Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights group Liberty, said: 'Yet again politicians resort to high talk and rushed legislation in an attempt to look tough in the face of terrorism.

'So youngsters will have their passports seized at borders and others will be prevented coming home.

'Even our universities must read from ministers' scripts on radicalisation. Another chilling recipe for injustice and resentment by closing down the open society you seek to promote.'

Labour leader Ed Miliband said his party would work with the Government to ensure the security services and police had the necessary powers.

Speaking on a visit to the Crossrail construction site in central London, Mr Miliband said: 'We share the Government's desire and ambition to make sure we keep people safe and deal with people returning from Syria or going to Syria.

'That's why we are going to be scrutinising Theresa May's proposals. We want to work with the Government and we will be looking closely at them.'

He added: 'I think we should always be looking at what more needs to be done to protect the security of our citizens.

'We have said, for example, in relation to Tpims - the control order the Government has put in place - that we should have a relocation power because that was important, that was part of the previous control order regime.

'We want to do everything we can to keep our citizens safe.'
