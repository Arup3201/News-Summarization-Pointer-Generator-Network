Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The Barnet boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football.

I was so proud to be English on Saturday night in a small café on the high street of Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso. I think our England team was superb. Roy has changed and evolved from his days at Fulham and West Brom to play an open, more expansive style of football to go through Steven Gerrard in the middle and keep the passing on the grass.

After his successful time at club level playing deep with two solid banks of four, I wondered whether Roy could change to suit a more open, expansive, possession-type game or stick with the old England way. At the final whistle I was disappointed sat there in my England shirt but I must say I was very proud of them and I think Roy deserves a lot of praise.

Cheer up Roy! Hodgson deserves praise for the way England played, despite the defeat

At this level with teams parking the bus and playing the formation 10-1, you have to have full backs with pace and quality going into the final third. But on Saturday night Leighton Baines and Glen Johnson never had the quality to penetrate and unlock the door.

Baines was steady in possession but was unable physically and athletically to get into the final third. Johnson got into the final third but technically, sadly for us, he is short. Roy will continue to play both these full backs but there will be a strong argument to pick the pace of Luke Shaw and the better technical ability of James Milner, but that would be a gamble.

Falling short: Neither Glen Johnson (left) nor Leighton Baines (right) could influence the match against Italy - there is surely an argument to bring in James Milner (below left) and Luke Shaw instead

What a questionable, diabolical decision to award that penalty to Brazil? Croatia were comfortable and not under any threat and, with all the shenanigans of the World Cup votes going to Qatar, it certainly does make you wonder...

With more and more teams parking the bus, it’s getting more difficult to score from open play. Now teams get everybody behind the ball and defend in the 10-1 formation that Fabio Capello talked about.

He was speaking at an FA coaching course two years ago and he looked and smiled as he described the new formation, but I think he had it right.

The mind-set is to defend deep, don’t let teams get behind you, get wide players to double up with the full backs and use deep central midfielders to screen the defence.

We’ve seen similar at Chelsea with Jose Mourinho using David Luiz and Cesar Azpilicueta in midfield against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, but it didn’t work. But with that defensive mind-set, set pieces become important.

Super set-piece: Claudio Marchisio scored for Italy after Andrea Pirlo cleverly stepped over a corner

On Saturday England had nine corners but the Italians were first to every one. England never looked like threatening the first ball in the Italian box. Instead it was the craft and skill of the Italian coach Cesare Prandelli that proved to be decisive.

Italy’s masterful short corner led to the first goal, with a quick pass to the edge of the box ‘through’ Andrea Pirlo finding Claudio Marchisio to smash it home.

Spain were 1-0 up and cruising, dominating possession, shifting the ball along the grass with pace and precision. It was mesmerising and the Dutch could not get near them. And then David Silva strikes but, without a defender in sight, the keeper palms it wide from only 10-yards out. It would have been 2-0 Spain and three points in the bag. Within a minute of his miss the Dutch equalised through RVP and now it looks like RIP for Spain.

Turning point: David Silva missed this chance to make it 2-0 to Spain - then Holland went and equalised...

This week I have been in Burkina Faso with the charity Coaching for Hope. Organised through the League Managers Association, we have done five days of coaching, helping the local coaches in the villages around the capital Ouagadougou.

Always boiling hot, the whole city is covered in an orangey, dirty dust like something from a Star Wars movie. It’s the third poorest country in the world but the local coaches are rich with enthusiasm.

There is so much energy and willingness and the men and women taking part have the biggest smiles all day every day. They travel so far on motorbikes, if they’re lucky, pushbikes or just plain walking to get here. And we’re talking about miles and miles and miles. But their smiles and their happiness is so powerful. These people have no money but they are still so rich.

I had the shock of my life at 7.30am one morning waiting for the Coaching for Hope jeep to take me to the national stadium to start my day. Leaning against the wall in the shade and, oh my God, right by my right elbow was a lizard as long as my arm. It ran past me missing my shoulder by inches and, I must confess, a visit to the loo was essential.
