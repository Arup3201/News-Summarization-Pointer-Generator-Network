Disney Princesses pay homage to their tearaway sister Miley Cyrus this Halloween in a set of illustrations by Italian artist Michele Moricci.

The one-time Hanna Montana star's raunchy new image provided fancy dress inspiration for Belle, Jasmine, Snow White, Tiana, Mulan, Pocahontas, Aurora, Mulan, Ariel, Pocahontas and Cinderella - who rock some of the singer's latest looks in the line drawings.

Cinderella keeps her bouffant up-do
and glass slippers on as she 'twerks out' in white leggings - crazy 
tongue, check - in the style of Miley in her We Can't Stop video, while 
Aurora from Sleeping Beauty 'nips out' in a fisherman's vest dress.

Belle from Beauty and the Beast ditches her prim yellow ballgown for moc-Doc Martens and nothing else in a cartoon pastiche of Miley's Wrecking Ball video

Snow White ditches her full-length billowing-sleeved Medieval dress for Miley's outfit form the VMAs - a nude latex two piece and foam finger.

Meanwhile, Belle swaps her yellow ballgown for moc-Doc Martens and hops on top of a wrecking ball.

Princess Jasmine from Aladdin rocks an oversized jacket and jeans combo with bare torso and fierce white spike heels as Mulan swaps her traditional robes for a fishnet bodycon dress - a daring look for anyone.

Princess Tiana actually looks quite normal in her cute matching two-piece, a more daytime look, while Ariel wears Miley's disturbing teddy one-piece with white brothel creepers.

Pocahontas sports Miley's 'coat and no knickers' look form her Bangerz album cover.

Moricci, an artist and graphics designer, 30, from Florence, put his collection together for Cosmopolitan magazine.

The
20-year-old pop star tweeted a photo last week that included all nine 
Miley-fied illustrations. She posted a montage picture along with: 
'#OGDISNEYPRINCESS ❤️❤️❤️❤️'.
