Three teens were arrested after police in central Ohio received at least 70 reports of vehicle damage during the past week.

Police in Newark said they began receiving calls last week about vehicle damage caused by BB guns, and officers reportedly found BB packages and CO2 cartridges near some of the damaged cars. 

Police said they arrested 18-year-old Steven Burns of Newark and two boys, ages 16 and 17, early Sunday on an unrelated charge of felonious assault.

At least one of the three confessed to damaging the vehicles. 

Sgt. Paul Davis said there have been more than 70 reports of vehicle damage in Newark and Heath, and he expects the number to grow. 

Police continued to get a stream of damage reports Monday, and some residents have also called to report BB gun damage to houses, Davis said.

Debris: Police said they're asking victims to send in pictures and provide estimated costs of the damage

One victim, Gary Brown, told NBC4i 'I just don't understand why people do that. I mean, it's not their van, it's not their stuff.

'It's my stuff, and I paid for it out of my money, not theirs.'

Police said they're asking victims to send in pictures and provide estimated costs of the damage.

Davis said police are preparing to file charges against the three arrested, but called it 'a huge undertaking' because of the large number of vandalism reports.
