A star that is travelling fast enough to escape the gravitational clutches of our galaxy has been discovered by a team of astronomers.

The amazing stellar object attained its rapid speed when a nearby star exploded as a supernova, sending it out of the Milky Way.

At its current speed it would make the journey from Earth to the moon in just five minutes - a trip which took the Apollo spacecraft three days.

Astronomers in Hawaii have found the fastest 'unbound' star in the galaxy. Called US 708 it is moving at 745 miles (1,200km) per second. It will leave the galaxy in about 25 million years. This artist's concept shows a star (left) being ejected from the galaxy, although in reality the supernova would have been faded long ago

The star, known as US 708, was first discovered in 1982 by Dr Peter Usher of Pennsylvania State University but had since then remained ignored.

However, a team of astronomers led by the University of Hawaii at Manoa has now re-examined the star, and found that it breaks the galactic speed record for an 'unbound' star.

US 708 is almost 62,000 light-years from Earth, and is on a path that will take it out of the Milky Way in about 25 million years.

Type 1a: A white dwarf accumulates material from a stellar companion until it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion and explodes.

Non-standard type 1a: Two white dwarfs merge until their combined mass causes an explosion.

Type II: A star at least nine times the mass of the sun eventually experiences a core collapse as its fuel runs out, causing it to explode.

Type 1b and 1c: A star undergoes core collapse but most of its outer hydrogen has already been lost to stellar winds.

Hypernova: Extreme type of supernova, 50 times as energetic as other supernovas, resulting in a black hole. The exact cause of them is unknown. 

Using the 10-metre Keck II and Pan-Starrs1 telescopes in Hawaii, the astronomers calculated that the star is moving at about 745 miles (1,200km) per second.

This makes it the fastest ‘rogue’ star in the galaxy - one that is no longer orbiting the centre.

‘At that speed, you could travel from Earth to the moon in five minutes,’ said Dr Eugene Magnier of the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

‘By observing the sky repeatedly over several years, the Pan-Starrs1 survey, let us make a movie of the motions of the stars in the sky.

‘That enables us to study the behavioirs of extremely rare and weird stars like US 708.’

While a handful of other stars escaping the galaxy are known, this is the first to have been found that was ejected by a thermonuclear supernova explosion.

US 708, which is a helium-rich white dwarf, was propelled at high speeds when a more massive white dwarf star nearby in a tight binary blew up.

At the speed US 708 is travelling it would make the journey from Earth to the moon in just five minutes - a trip which took the Apollo astronauts three days. Pictured is the view of Earth seen by the Apollo 8 crew as they circled the moon in December 1968

This particular class of supernova is known as type 1a, where material is transferred between one star and another until one reaches a critical mass, and explodes.

Often, the secondary star is obliterated in the resulting explosion, or pushed away at a more sedate speed.

It is 'pushed' away because the loss of its companion means it no longer has a star to orbit, but retains its forwards momentum, so it is flung into space. 

The specific characteristics of this binary system, its distance and the mass of its companion, allowed US 708 to remain intact while still achieving record speeds for an unbound star.

Stars like the sun are bound to our galaxy by its gravity, and orbit its centre at relatively moderate velocities, typically tens to a few hundreds of kilometres per second.

Only so-called hyperveolocity stars are known to travel so fast that they are unbound to the galaxy.

US 708, which is a helium-rich white dwarf, was propelled at high speeds when a more massive white dwarf star nearby in a tight binary blew up (illustration shown). It is the first star found to be leaving the galaxy caused by such an event, and could provide an insight into these types of supernova

In addition, to escape from the Milky Way an object needs to exceed the ‘escape velocity’ - the strength of its gravitational pull.

The escape velocity of our galaxy is about 375 miles (600km) per second, which US 708 easily exceeds.

Astronomers hope that studying the star could help reveal how such helium-rich stars and thermonuclear supernovae are linked.
