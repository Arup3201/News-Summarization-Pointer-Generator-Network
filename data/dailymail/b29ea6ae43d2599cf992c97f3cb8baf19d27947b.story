A Florida fisherman got the shock of his life when he reeled in his fishing line to find this monster on the end.

Steve Bargeron was fishing from a dock in Fort Pierce as he watched a fellow fisherman pull this strange creature out of the water.

Mr Bargeron described the giant sea creature as being about 18 inches long. The shrimp was striking its own tail, so the fisherman grabbed it by its back like a lobster.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said they are stumped as to the exact species of the underwater creature. 

But they believe it could be some type of mantis shrimp - which is actually neither a mantis nor a shrimp at all, but a kind of crustacean called a stomatopod.

These creatures may can reach 12 inches in length, or even longer in  exceptional cases - which would put this catch at the extreme end of the scale.

The mantis shrimp is one of the major invertebrate predators on coral reefs, sea grass beds and sand and rubble flats, but relatively little is known about the species.

But the creatures are known for their large stalked compound eyes, which give them incredibly complex vision.

They live in crevices or in burrows that they build themselves and are surprisingly agile.

The second distinctive feature of the mantis shrimp is the powerful claws that they use to attack and kill prey by spearing, stunning or even dismemberment.

This has earned the creatures the nickname 'thumb splitters' – due to their ability to inflict painful gashes using their claws if handled incautiously

In captivity, some of the larger species of mantis shrimp are capable of breaking through glass with a single strike.

There are thought to be more than 400 species of mantis shrimp, coming in a variety of colours, from shades of brown to distinctive bright neon.

Some of the brighter species use the fluorescent patterns on their bodies behavioural signals for contacting other mantis shrimp.

They have surprisingly developed memories and are able to recognise individual neighbours that they have interacted with on a frequent basis previously..

The crustaceans can also recognise each other by visual signs and even by individual smell, and many have developed complex social behaviour to defend their space from rivals.
