Athletes such as Usain Bolt (pictured) have distinct genetic codes that give them their explosive and sustained fitness, according to a new study

Scientists have discovered a certain genetic characteristic, or genotype, is more common in power athletes like sprinters than in normal people and even endurance athletes.

Usain Bolt and Mo Farah have distinct genetic codes that give them their explosive and sustained fitness, according to a new study.

Polish researchers found the variety of the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene is two to three times more common in elite power athletes than nonathletic people.

The adjustment to the AGT gene may alter how the renin-angiotensin system performs, changing the way blood pressure, body salt, and fluid balance are regulated in the body.

But scientists think the characteristic might give the likes of Bolt a boost by increasing the production of a hormone called angiotensin II, which is crucial for muscle performance.

Genetic tests on Polish international elite power and endurance athletes who had competed in World and European Championships, World Cups, or Olympic Games as well asÂ  non athletes, were carried out by Dr Ciszczyk of University of Szczecin in Poland.

Overall, 100 power-oriented athletes, including sprinters, jumpers and power lifters as well as 123 endurance athletes, such as long-distance runners, swimmers and rowers were tested, while 344 non-athletes were studied for comparison.

They found the adjustment to the AGT gene was found in 40 per cent of power athletes, compared 18 per cent of non-athletes, while it was found in just 13 per cent of the endurance athletes.

However, results published in Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research showed there was no real difference between the higher and the lower ranks of elite power athletes who had the gene.

100 power-oriented athletes, including sprinters like Mo Farah (pictured right), plus 123 endurance athletes and 344 non-athletes were studied for comparison. Scientists found the adjustment to the AGT gene was found in 40 per cent of power athletes, compared 18 per cent of non-athletes

The scientists pointed out that while the characteristic was nearly three time more common among the power athletes than endurance athletes, the exact effect the gene had on strength and performance was yet to be determined.

Pinpointing the exact genes that make people stronger or faster will have implications for all sports and their elite competitors in the future, according to Dr Ciszczyk.

She said: 'Identifying genetic characteristics related to athletic excellence or individual predisposition to types of sports with different demands (power or endurance oriented) or even sport specialty may be decisive in recognizing athletic talent, and probably will allow for greater specificity in steering of sports training programs.'
