Departed: Officials reported a house fire at the home of John Sheridan, Jr, that killed two early Sunday morning

A healthcare CEO credited with 'helping revitalize Camden' was found dead along with his wife following a house fire Sunday Morning.

Cooper University Health System, where John Sheridan, Jr, was president and CEO, put out a statement Sunday announcing the dead of him and his wife, Joyce.

The statement did not mention the cause of death, but Philly.com reported that a house fire that killed two on Meadow Run Drive in Montgomery matched the address given for Sheridan on political campaign contribution records.

The statement issued by Cooper said the organization was 'saddened to announce the death' of Sheridan and his wife. 

'There is no one else who has had as big an impact on me as John did except my father,' said Cooper Health System board of trustees chairman George E. Norcross III in the statement.

Adrienne Kirby, president and CEO of Cooper University Health, remembered Sheridan for his 'quiet strength, his decisiveness and his passionate belief that Cooper not only could make a difference in people’s lives, it had an obligation to do so.'

Sheridan was credited for getting the first new medical school in three decades built in New Jersey, having helped bring plans for the Cooper Medical School at Rowan University to fruition in 2012.

'Perhaps his greatest contribution to the larger Cooper community was his commitment to helping revitalize Camden,' the statement said. 

'There was never a day that went by when he wasn’t focused on what Cooper could do to help revitalize the city that he loved.'

Camden mayor Dana Redd released a statement of condolences as well.

'They will both be profoundly missed by the entire Camden community,' wrote Redd. 'I have personally known John Sheridan since 2001. We worked closely as Cooper enhanced their campus and during the early planning stages of the Cooper Medical School of Rowan University.'

Sheridan began in law after graduating from Rutgers Law School. He later worked his way up to co-chairman at law firm Riker, Danzig, Riker, where he was also senior partner.

Before Cooper, he served as general counsel to the New Jersey Turnpike authority and sat on the board of trustees at the Carrier Clinic.

Fire officials did not release information about the deaths, citing an ongoing investigation.

NJ.com reports that neighbors said they were woken up by sirens early Sunday morning but did not see flames or exterior damage to the home.
