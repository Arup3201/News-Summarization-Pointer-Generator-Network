Firefighters staged a dramatic rescue attempt in China after a woman attempted to throw herself off the 10th floor of an apartment block.

The woman had reportedly quarrelled with her family members shortly before attempting to commit suicide in Changchun, the capital of northeast China's Jilin Province.

After locking herself in her bedroom she made her way out onto the balcony before the emergency services were called to the scene.

When they arrived, they discovered that residents on the 11th and 12th floors of the building weren’t at home meaning they struggled to access the woman.

They initially tried to persuade her to step back inside, before dangling a rope from the 13th floor.
