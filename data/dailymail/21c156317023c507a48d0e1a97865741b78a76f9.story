James Milner and Leighton Baines missed England training ahead of the friendly with Peru later this week, while Wayne Rooney looked to be taking no prisoners - despite the intense training and warm-weather clothes.

Roy Hodgson had his squad wearing more layers at St George's Park in readiness for Brazil next month.

And the manager enjoyed an almost full compliment on Tuesday. Only Milner and Baines were elsehwere, with the Manchester City midfielder absent with a head cold and worked in the gym alone, while the first choice left-back had family commitments.

Baines will be fine to play the warm-up game against the South Americans at Wembley. The squad trained with the adidas Brazuca - the World Cup's official ball - but will use a Nike on Friday.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Phil Jones, who both had been struggling for fitness, took a full part in morning drills, which involved struck contact sessions.

Ray Lewington and Gary Neville were in charge of directing the eight defenders, while fitness coach Chris Neville took the midfielders.

Rooney, Daniel Sturridge, Danny Welbeck and Rickie Lambert were all with Tony Strudwick - another fitness coach - with Hodgson wandering between the groups.

Strudwick clattered the rugby tackle bags into his group, before the strikers were to spin off their marker as training tried to replicate match situations.

Welbeck, Frank Lampard, Glen Johnson and Raheem Sterling all wore gloves.

Sterling 
carried on his rich vein of form in training ahead of the tournament. 
Hodgson organised an attack against defence drill, in which the 
Liverpool man excelled yet again. The winger was up against Luke Shaw 
and looked sharp.

He
 is expected to start against Peru, but talk gathers as to whether the 
19-year-old could actually be handed a start when the Three Lions 
kick-off against Italy on June 14.

Sterling
 gives added direct width to Hodgson, who severely lacked flair options 
when England crashed out of Euro 2012 on penalties against the Italians.
