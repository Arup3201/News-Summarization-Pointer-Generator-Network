New Argentina boss Gerardo Martino has slammed the level of media scrutiny directed at those who manage superstars such as Lionel Messi, claiming the joy is taken away from coaching such talent.

Martino suggests the enormous pressure and constant questioning surrounding Messi means coaches will be criticised regardless of the talisman's performances.

The former Barcelona manager will team up with the four-time Ballon d'Or winner having replaced Alejandro Sabella, who left the post following Argentina's agonising World Cup final defeat to Germany in July.

Thankless: Gerardo Martino says managers who coach Lionel Messi can never win due to the level of scrutiny 

'When you get the chance to coach a footballer like Leo it's very difficult to be exempt from comments and rumours,' said Martino ahead of Wednesday's World Cup final rematch against Germany.

'In our time together at Barcelona, it was said he was saving himself for the World Cup. But in La Liga he scored about 30 goals.

'There were always questions about Leo, if he scored three goals then why had he scored three goals? If he scored one, then why had he only scored one? And if didn't score at all, it was the same.'

Injured: Lionel Messi picked up a groin injury during Barcelona's 1-0 win over Villarreal on Sunday

Barcelona's talisman was a late withdrawal from the squad to play Joachim Low's men in the friendly having picked up an injury on Sunday and Martino revealed national team doctors will travel to Catalunya to check up on his injury after Wednesday's game.

'Now rumours are circulating again. Unfortunately we coaches happen to be here to clarify the rumours, which become tiresome,' he added.

'After the game against Germany, the national team doctor will go and see Messi [in Barcelona],

'Sometimes it's not necessary for players to come here for us to find out about the injury. We didn't have Ezequiel Garay come over from Russia.

'Sometimes it's better to have the doctors go to see the players.'
