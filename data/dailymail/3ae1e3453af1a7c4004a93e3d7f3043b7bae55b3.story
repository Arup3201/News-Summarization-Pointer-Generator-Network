Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge has revealed he has returned to first team training following his recovery from a troublesome thigh injury.

Sturridge, who has played just three games for the Reds so far this season, is in contention to face West Ham on Saturday.

The 25-year-old's last match came for Roy Hodgson's England side against Norway back on September 3.

Sturridge has an outside chance of facing former side Chelsea in the second leg of the Capital One Cup on Tuesday, according to his manager Brendan Rodgers.

Rodgers, speaking to BT Sport, said after his side's goalless draw against Bolton: 'Daniel trains with the team on Sunday – he’s at a real good level in terms of his fitness at the moment.

'He completed his final rehabilitation with the medical and sports science guys, so he'll be ready for the West Ham game - whether he starts or not will depend closer to the time.

‘We’ll see if we can get him back for the Chelsea game in midweek too.'

Rodgers will be hoping Sturridge's return will provide his side with a timely boost in their quest to finish in the top four.

His side are currently eighth, five points behind fourth-placed Manchester United.   

The Liverpool striker is looking forward to playing alongside team-mate Mario Balotelli
