All smiles: Even though William Hung didn't make it to the next round on American Idol he won the hearts of fans all over the world

At the time on his audition in 2003, Hung was just civil engineering student at UC Berkley and his performance won him the affection of so many fans, he dropped out of school to pursue a music career.

'I really appreciate all of the support I have received from my fans around the world...I couldn't succeed without you.  I also want to encourage you to pursue your dreams, persevere, and to work hard  at what you are passionate about...then you'll be living a life without regrets!' says a quote from William Hung on his fan page.

The audition which aired four months later brought Hung into the spotlight. Fans appreciated his positive outlook on life and his willingness to try his best and not let criticism get the best of him.

'You can't sing, you can't dance, so what do you want me to say?' said notoriously blunt judge Simon Cowell following Hung's rendition of Ricky Martin's song.

Hung defended himself by saying, 'I already gave my best, and I have no regrets at all.'

Judges Randy Johnson and Paula Abdul commended his attitude.

'That's the best attitude yet, ‘said Abdul.

Always telling his fans to follow their dreams until they succeed, Hung maintained a successful music career until 2011 when he went to work as a statistician for the LA County Sheriff's Department.

Rumorfix.com reports that Hung is currently employed as an administrative assistant for the LA County Department of Public Health.
