Two women driving around their Cleveland neighborhood became witnesses to a historic rescue when they shot a video of police raiding the home of kidnapping suspect Ariel Castro.

Jasmina Baldrich and Ashley Colon thought they were about to be pulled over last Monday when they noticed a police cruiser behind them, and turned onto Seymour Avenue.

There, they saw a heavy police presence, with officers approaching Castro's house. The spectacle prompted Miss Baldrich to take out her iPhone and start videotaping what was going on.

Intense: This video captures police officers prying the door of Ariel Castro's home, and flooding in, some reaching for their guns

Response: Additional officers sprint to the home after gaining entry through the front door

In the video, cops can be seen prying open the front door of Castro's house. Once open, they flood into the home, some reaching for their handguns.

The women also said that they saw a woman pass who claimed that she was Amanda Berry, and they couldn't believe their ears. 

Miss Baldrich told NewsChannel5.com: 'We just seen cops and then out of nowhere all we see Amanda walking by saying, "I'm Amanda Berry."'

Like others in the community, Miss Baldrich was familiar with the Amanda Berry case, and were shocked to find the missing woman, clutching her six-year-old daughter.

Photographers: The video was shot by Jasmina Baldrich, who was in a car driven by friend Ashley Colon

Free: A neighbor got a picture of Amanda Berry as she escaped the home last Monday with her six-year-old daughter, who the kidnapper's brothers previously saw with Ariel on trips to McDonalds

Miss Baldrich told NewsChannel5: 'We knew like that [snapping fingers].  We both got goose bumps at the same time.  We were shocked, we could not believe it but it clicked.'

Miss Colon added: 'People would die just to see these girls get saved and we just happened to be there.'

Castro is being held on $8million bond.

The 52-year-old ex-school bus driver was charged with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape.

The women, now in their 20s and 30s, vanished separately between 2002 and 2004. At the time, they were 14, 16 and 20 years old.
