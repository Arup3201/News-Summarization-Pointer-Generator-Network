A teen beauty queen has followed in her mother's high heeled footsteps - by clinching the same beauty pageant title as she did 30 years earlier.

Zara Holland, 18, is now in the running to be made Miss England after being crowned Miss Hull.

But for proud mother, Cheryl Hakeney, 49, her daughter's victory was extra special - because she herself held the Miss Hull title in 1984, when she was just 19.

Good genes: Zara Holland, 18, is now in the running to be made Miss England after being crowned Miss Hull. Her mother Cheryl Hakeney, 49, held the title herself in 1984, when she was 19

The similarity between the pair in their winners' photos is striking - with the exception of Cheryl's 80s perm.

Cheryl, from Hull, East Yorks, says: 'It was totally incredible when Zara won. I was seeing it from a different angle.

'When it is your child, you just want them to do well and I was really rooting for her to win.

'There were so many pretty girls that entered. When they announced Zara had won, I thought I was going to faint.'

Proud: Cheryl, from Hull, East Yorks, said: 'It was totally incredible when Zara won.'

Talented: Zara has also done some acting, appearing in Hollyoaks, Coronation Street and Emmerdale, and now hopes to take home the Miss England title

The Miss Hull and District final was held on Friday evening at The Country Park Inn in Hessle and saw 30 girls compete for the coveted title over four rounds.

Zara, an aspiring actress who has appeared in Hollyoaks, Coronation Street and Emmerdale, says: 'I'm still on cloud nine at the moment, it is absolutely amazing. I could not be any happier.

'I did not expect to win at all. When they called out my name, I just burst into tears. It was the best feeling in my whole entire life.

'Everyone involved in the competition has been amazing and so supportive.

Changing times: Cheryl, pictured for the swimwear round, says that a lot has changed and the competitions are much more 'up-to-date' now and look for the whole package rather than just a pretty face

Back in the day: Cheryl admits that beauty pageants have changed from what they were like 30 years ago when she competed

'All the other girls who entered have also been lovely and have been sending me messages congratulating me.

'I am just so happy to represent Hull in the Miss England final.'

Zara was able to ask her mother for advice on the competition, after Cheryl was crowned Miss Viking Radio, the equivalent to what is now Miss Hull and District, when the competition first started.

Zara, 18, adds: 'Mum knows all about what it is like to be in the competitions. It is really nice because we can talk about everything.

Going for gold: Zara will now represent Hull at the Miss England final held in Torquay in June and has her mother's guidance

Proud: For Cheryl, her daughters victory was extra special - because she had held the title herself in 1984, when she was just 19

'She has been lovely throughout all of this, really supportive. We are really close and get on so well.'

'Mum was the runner-up when she was in Miss England, so I am hoping to go that one stage further and take the title,' Zara says.

Cheryl admits that beauty pageants have changed from what they were like 30 years ago.

She says: 'There are no swimwear rounds now and before it was more about looks and figures.

Firm friends: Cheryl says she is still friends with a number of girls from the pageants, which she describes as 'fantastic'

Following in her footsteps: Zara said of the competition: 'Mum was the runner-up when she was in Miss England, so I am hoping to go that one stage further and take the title'

'The pageants are a lot more up-to-date now. Judges are looking for a complete package, someone who is elegant and can really put their town on the map.

'I was lucky enough to win a series of titles across the country, I really got the bug and loved competing.

'I am still friends with a number of girls from the pageants, which is fantastic.'
