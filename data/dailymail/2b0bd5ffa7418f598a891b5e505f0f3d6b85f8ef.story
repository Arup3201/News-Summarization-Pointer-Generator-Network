This Christmas a new campaign has been launched  with the aim of doing away with traditional 'girls' and 'boys' toys, instead encouraging children to play with gender-neutral items.

The 'No Gender December' movement was kick-started by grassroots organisation Play Unlimited, and argues that subjecting children to strict gender stereotypes can perpetuate discrimination.

They have called on consumers to boycott the aisles of pink and blue merchandise which line shops across the country, and avoid stereotypes during this year's Christmas shopping.

A new campaign called No Gender December by group Play Unlimited has been launched asking people to boycott gendered presents this Christmas

Australian Greens spokesperson for women Larissa Waters has thrown her support behind the campaign, encouraging friends and relatives to make informed decisions when purchasing gifts this festive season.

'Out-dated stereotypes about girls and boys and men and women, perpetuate gender inequality, which can feed into very serious problems such as domestic violence and the gender pay gap,' Senator Waters said. 

'The separate aisles of pink and blue common in many stores might seem harmless, especially to well-meaning relatives and friends, who are buying plenty of children’s gifts at this time of the year.

'However, setting such stark gender roles at such an early age can have a long-term impacts on our children, including impacting self-perception and career choices later in life,' she added. 

Play Unlimited co-founder Julie Huberman, based in Queensland, hopes the campaign will prompt toy companies to become more inclusive in their marketing.

'We don't to stop girls from playing with dolls or boys playing with trucks,' Ms Huberman told Daily Mail Australia.

'We want kids to be able to choose rather than being told what to play with. There are plenty of little girls out there who want to play with trucks.

'It’s 2014 – women mow lawns and men push prams but while we've moved on, many toy companies haven’t,' Ms Huberman said.

'It's not doing away with anything but just making it a choice.' 

She argues that gender stereotypes instilled in kids from a young age can lead to more complex problems like domestic violence later in life

However the campaign has already come under fire from one child psychologist, who argues that the link between gender stereotyped toys and domestic violence is 'a stretch'.

'These gender differences are hard wired, and while I’m sure socialisation plays a role, to argue that toys in any way relate to domestic violence is, I think, too far a stretch,' Dr Michael Carr-Gregg told News Corp. 

On its website, Play Unlimited makes the argument that continuing to abide by 'old-fashioned' gendered stereotypes could be damaging for young children.

'Listing toys as being either for girls or for boys could have the effect of alienating a boy from feeling okay about showing interest in say ‘crafts and arts’ and vice-versa for a girl who may otherwise have gravitated towards a remote control helicopter.

Play Unlimited co-founder Julie Huberman said 'We don't to stop girls from playing with dolls or boys playing with trucks'

'Both labels ‘boys/girls’ and gender stereotyped packaging (pink/blue or darker colours), inform children and others “this toy is/is not for you”,' the website reads.

The campaign calls on people to take the pledge not to purchase gendered toys this Christmas, and also urges supporters to sign a petition with the aim of getting the Australian government to legislate against gendered marketing.

'By standing together we can send a strong message to toy companies that that there is no place for toys perpetuating outdated gender stereotypes under our Christmas trees or in our homes,' Ms Huberman said.
