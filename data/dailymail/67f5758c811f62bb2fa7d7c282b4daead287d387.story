A grieving couple were sent a text asking them to rate their son's A&E experience from the hospital two days after he died of a stroke. 

John Wood, 71, and his wife Patricia, 68, from Garforth, West Yorkshire, were sorting through the belongings of their son Darren, who collapsed and died earlier this month, aged 42.

But two days later they were sent a text message on their deceased son's phone asking him to rate his stay at A&E and how likely they are to recommend the hospital's services to others.

Darren Wood suffered a massive stroke and died at Leeds St James's Hospital last month at the age of 42

The message also asked them to rate the service with a number between one and six, depending on the quality of care.

Darren, a 42-year-old pipe fitter, was speaking to a flatmate at his shared house when he suffered a massive stroke and was rushed to Leeds St James's Hospital.

He was put on a life support machine but died later that night on February 3.

Retired Mr Wood said: 'His housemate said he just went blank all of a sudden and she said "are you alright, Darren?"

Two days after his death his parents were sent a text from the hospital on his phone asking for feedback on his stay and the quality of care received

'Then he keeled over and the landlord, who is an old friend of mine, rang me to tell me that my Darren was on the floor.

'When we got to hospital he was on a life support machine and wasn't breathing on his own.

'The staff who worked on Darren were fantastic and did everything they could for him and kept us informed.'

He added: 'We're devastated and I'm just trying to come to terms with losing my son and trying to get through everything and get the all the paperwork out of the way.

'It's been a difficult time but we are together so it's easier when there's two of us. 

'You feel empty when you lose someone and when you get a text message like that and it just takes your breath away. 

'I want this stopped and don't want it to happen to any other people. It could push someone over the edge and they're already dealing with the loss of someone close to them. 

'It's the non-medical staff and the disgusting bureaucracy of the NHS that's the problem.'

Darren, who suffered from high blood pressure, had been working on renovation works at the hospital where he died until he was let go in late January.

Mr Wood added: 'Everyone who met Darren and worked with him said what a lovely guy he was and how hard he worked.

'He'd just had to sign on but had received a couple of job offers so thinks were really looking up for him.

'He wasn't a materialistic guy and never wanted anything, just enough to get by with and he loved his films and quizzes on TV.'

Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust has since apologised for sending the message, which is used to gain feedback on services.

An Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust spokesman said: 'We are extremely sorry for the added distress this text message caused the Wood family following their tragic bereavement.

'This message should not have been sent and we have recently spoken to Mr John Wood to apologise in person and to reassure him that we are looking into how this happened as we want to prevent another family being upset in this way.'

A stroke is a brain attack which happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. It can be caused by a blockage in one of the blood vessels leading to the brain or a bleed in the brain. 

Strokes affect people in different ways, depending on the part of the brain that is affected, how widespread the damage is and how healthy the person was before the stroke. 

A stroke can affect the way the body functions as well as your thought processes and how you feel and communicate.

Recognising the signs of a stroke can be identified using the FAST test - Face, Arm, Speech, Time.
