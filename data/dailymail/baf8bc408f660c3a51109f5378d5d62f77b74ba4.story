Young Jenna Gavin landed the 616-pound bluefin tuna after a two-hour battle on a charter boat on the Northumberland Straight, Nova Scotia where she was congratulated by record-holder Ken Fraser

Jenna Gavin was fishing with her parents in the Northumberland Straight, Nova Scotia 

Now, her success is likely to get her into the record books for the biggest fish ever landed by a girl aged between 11 and 16. 

Details of the massive fish have been sent to the International Game Fishing Association for verification. 

For the record to stand, Jenna's parents had to leave her alone to battle and land the tuna. 

The youngster's mother Chandra said: 'Jenna was thrilled when she finished the fight and was really excited when we pulled it out of the water to put it on the deck.

1,496 The weight in pounds which an adult bluefin tuna can reach

1.05 The amount in millions a tuna sold at auction in Japan in January

43 The speed in miles per hour they can travel

4,000 The distance in miles a bluefin tuna will migrate from the Gulf of Mexico to Iceland

3,500 The price per pound a fresh bluefin tuna in perfect condition can reach

1,000 The depth in metres a bluefin tuna can dive

90 The percentage decline in bluefin tuna numbers in the Atlantic due to over-fishing

21 The maximum length in feet of adult fish

30 The maximum age of an adult fish

8 The age at which they reach sexual maturity

'The biggest fish she had caught before this was a mackerel which we use for bait, they weigh roughly around one pound.

'The fish was caught just below the surface, maybe 10ft down, our mate saw the silver flash as the fish swam through the water.

'The last 40 minutes of the fight were difficult because the fish was straight down behind the boat and she had 30-35 pounds of drag on her the whole time.' 

The holder of the record for the largest bluefin tuna ever caught, Ken Fraser, was fishing nearby when Jenna hooked her own monster. Fraser landed a 1496 fish off the coast of Nova Scotia in October 1979.

Mrs Gavin said: 'Ken Fraser was chartering another boat out of the same dock as us, it was purely coincidence that he was there at the same time.

'I believed she could do it and I knew she had the ability and the strength but I was also aware it was a huge challenge.

'Jenna would agree that it was a difficult fish to catch, the last part of the fight was very hard, her legs were starting to shake and she was getting a bit teary.

'I encouraged her through the whole fight, I promised her an iPad mini if she didn't give up and I told her to get mad and drag him up and she did.'

Jenna Gavin and her family sent details of her catch to the International Game Fishing Association
