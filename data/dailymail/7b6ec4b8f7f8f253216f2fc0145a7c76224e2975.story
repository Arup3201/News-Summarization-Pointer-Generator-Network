Danger: A korma sauce bearing Loyd Grossman's name has been issued with a recall after two people were hospitalised with botulism poisoning

TV chef Loyd Grossman was today 'distressed and upset' after two children were taken to hospital with botulism after eating by his korma sauce.

The two youngsters were rushed to hospital with the potentially deadly bug on Sunday after eating a meal prepared with the curry sauce over the weekend.

It is not yet known how they came down with the illness but 47,000 jars of the sauce have now been recalled.

Mr Grossman, who developed the recipe for the sauces, was 'in shock' after hearing about the apparent poisoning.

His agent Peter Schnabl told MailOnline: 'Loyd is very upset and distressed at the minute.

'It was a such a big shock when he was told about the illness of the children. He's devastated. It's all very upsetting.

'Loyd's not just putting his name to the products, it's a full involvement.

'We're furiously trying to figure out what has happened.

'Loyd will be leading the charge in finding out who's responsible. He's not happy about it.'

A spokeswoman for NHS Forth Valley said the two patients from the same family are in a 'stable and improving' condition.

The Food Standards Agency has advised the public not to consume jars of the sauce as it may pose a risk of botulism poisoning. It said a batch of the korma sauce has been recalled and is being removed from shop shelves.

The product recall relates to 350g jars of Loyd Grossman Korma sauce with a best-before date of February 2013 and a batch code of 1218R 07:21.

The sauce is made by Premier Foods, the UK’s largest food manufacturer, which is responsible for more than 40 household brands including Mr Kipling, Hovis, Branston, Bisto and Oxo.

Botulism is caused by toxins produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which is the deadliest naturally occurring poison in the world and attacks the nervous system.

The illness can be fatal in up to 10 per cent of cases, and victims can take many months to recover.

Symptoms of food-borne botulism, which include blurred vision and difficulty swallowing and speaking, can rapidly get worse and lead to muscle weakness and paralysis. 

They typically begin between 12 and 36 hours after eating a contaminated meal, but may appear in as little as six hours.

Anyone suffering these symptoms after eating the product is being advised to seek medical help urgently.

The infection cannot be spread from person to person.

While the initial cases of illness have occurred in Scotland, the Food Standards Agency and Scottish health authorities have issued a UK-wide alert. The FSA said: ‘Anyone who has any of the jars from this batch of Loyd Grossman Korma sauce should not eat it.

Setback: Grossman says his sauces use the best ingredients and that he personally insists on tasting each on new recipe until he knows it is just right

Botulism is a rare but serious illness which can lead to paralysis.

It can be caused either by ingesting the botulinum toxin or by contamination in a wound. It cannot be transferred from person to person.

Botulism can lead to paralysis which usually starts with the muscles in the face - particularly those in the eyes and those used for chewing - and spreads towards the limbs.

In severe cases the breathing muscles can become paralysed, causing respiratory failure.

Botulism can be prevented by killing the spores by cooking food about 121°C for three minutes.

Treatment for respiratory paralysis can require a patient to be on a ventilator for weeks as well as being treated in intensive care.

After several weeks, the paralysis usually slowly improves.

‘Two members of the same family who 
have contracted botulism and have eaten from a jar of this batch of 
sauce have been hospitalised in Scotland.

‘Only
one jar from the batch is known to have been contaminated with 
Clostridium botulinum, which causes botulism, but the agency is advising
people not to eat products from this batch as a precautionary measure.’

Dr John Cowden, consultant
epidemiologist at Health Protection Scotland, said: ‘People can be 
reassured that botulism is rare in the UK.

‘Any person, child or adult, with the symptoms should seek urgent medical advice. Anti-toxins have proved very effective in treating the condition if treated early, although full recovery may take several months.’

The news will be a heavy blow to the reputation of the TV food guru’s line of products, which includes curry and pasta sauces.

The products are marketed on the basis that they use ‘only the very best ingredients’.

Mr
Grossman has promoted the sauces saying: ‘I love food and believe great
food comes from care and attention to detail. That’s why I insist on 
tasting every recipe until it’s just right.’

Spores of Clostridium botulinum are normally found in soil and can get into food products via contamination of farmers’ fields.

There
have been cases in the past – although extremely rare – of the spores 
and associated toxin being found in food sold in cans and jars.

The
NHS website says just 500g of the toxin ‘is enough to kill every human 
being on the planet’, adding: ‘The toxins . . . block a special type of 
chemical called a neurotransmitter. Neurotransmitters send messages from
your brain to the rest of your nervous system.

‘In
the case of botulism, the toxin blocks the effects of a 
neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, which is used by your body to 
help stimulate muscles. If acetylcholine is blocked, it causes paralysis
which, if left untreated, can lead to death.’A spokesman for Premier Foods, the makers of the sauce, said: 'The safety of consumers is of paramount importance to us.  At this stage, we understand that the incident relates to a single jar of Korma sauce.  There is no evidence of any broader contamination, no further reports of illness have been notified to the authorities and we have had no consumer complaints of illness related to this product.

'We are working urgently with the authorities to investigate the cause of this incident, including how the jar may have been transported and stored after leaving the factory. While these investigations are underway, we have initiated a precautionary recall of the specific batch code in the interests of the safety of our consumers.'
