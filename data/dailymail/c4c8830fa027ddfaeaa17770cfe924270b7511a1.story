A man accused of battering a frail pensioner to death was arrested by police at a library yesterday.

It happened after concerned staff who had seen pictures issued by police of Graeme Jarman, 47, raised the alarm when they suspected he was inside the building in Filey, North Yorkshire.

Jarman became the subject of a nationwide manhunt after detectives discovered the body of 77-year-old Judith Richardson at her home in Hexham,Northumberland, on August 19.

It is believed her attacker killed her with a hammer before stealing her handbag.

Jarman disappeared from his home in Consett, Co Durham, two days before Miss Richardson was found.

Durham Police appealed for him to come forward on August 23.

Miss Richardson’s handbag was found dumped in a bin outside a charity shop in Newcastle city centre, 25 miles from her house.

A passer-by handed it to police who went to her home in an attempt to return it – but instead found her lifeless body.

Last Monday, detectives issued CCTV images of Jarman and warned the public not to approach him.

More than 40 officers from Northumbria, Durham and Cleveland forces worked with colleagues in Dorset, Sussex and Kent after it emerged Jarman regularly visited the areas.

Police believe in the week before the murder Jarman lost a considerable amount of money gambling.

Northumbria Police said Jarman was detained after staff at a library in Filey alerted officers at 3pm this afternoon.

Yesterday a niece of the victim spoke out to urge anyone with information to contact police.

She said: ‘We are a very private family and we are finding all of this so horrific. We thank everyone for all the lovely condolences and good wishes that we have received and sincerely thank everyone who has helped the police in any way.

‘We would also like to ask everyone to please keep helping the police with any information to assist them in finding whoever is responsible for Judith's devastating death.’

Detective Chief Superintendent Neil Adamson said of the arrest: 'I would like to thank the public and the media for their assistance during this investigation.

'It has been their support which has made this arrest possible.

'I would also like to take the opportunity to mention the unwavering support we have received from police forces across the country.

'It is to them, as much as to the officers of Northumbria, Cleveland and Durham I owe my thanks.'
