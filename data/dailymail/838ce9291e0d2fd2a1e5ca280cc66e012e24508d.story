At less than 8ft wide, there is barely room to swing a cat. 

But this tiny one-bedroom home - wedged between two shops on a high street - has gone on the market for £220,000.

And the pint-sized property in Tring, Hertfordshire, has just 479sq ft of space, already has an offer close to the asking price.

Wedged: The glass-fronted home on Western Road in Tring, Hertfordshire, pictured, is less than 8ft wide

Bright: Skylights and large windows at the front of the property mean the home is flooded with light 

Modern: The one-bedroom bolthole boasts a sleek bathroom, pictured, and high-end fittings throughout

Just 40 miles from London, estate agents said the property could appeal to city workers looking for the perfect bolt-hole.

The glass-fronted house, a former kitchen shop, boasts a single bedroom, bathroom, dining room and fully-furnished kitchen.

The price tag includes a £5,000 interior design package which could be used by the buyer to furnish the property.

It was converted for residential use by architect Katharine Allen and stands out on the high street with its all-glass frontage - which also allows in plenty of light.

Caroline Murgatroyd, director and valuer at Hunters, said: 'It's quite quirky and could make a nice batchelor pad.

'It was a shop and we are turning it into a house - we are calling it a house because it's freehold.

'We have justified the price on the fact it is architect-designed, has vaulted ceilings and high-end fittings such as Corian worktops, and it has its own parking space.'

Converted: The space, which used to be a kitchen shop, left, has been tastefully redesigned into a home, right

She added: 'In Tring, all these spaces will definitely be snapped up by first-time buyers or investors.

'We are seeing the majority of our buyers coming in from London as prices are very high in London and Tring is particularly popular, it's one of the top areas.

'It's the schools here, and obviously the distance to London. The potential for Crossrail to be extended into the area has made an impact.

'It's a nice, trendy place to be with bars and restaurants, and you also have the reservoirs and countryside giving everything you need for family life.'
