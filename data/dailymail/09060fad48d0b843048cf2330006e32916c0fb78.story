Manchester's M21 postcode of Chorlton-cum-Hardy and Barlow Moor, on the outskirts of the city, slipped from top spot last year to third position in this year's burglary claims table.

Woodford and South Woodford in E18 in east London had the fifth highest number of claims, while the capital’s sought-after suburbs of Teddington and Bushy Park in TW11 are also in the top ten.

Most likely area in which to get burgled: A road in the centre of the RM8 postcode of Dagenham and Becontree in east London, which has an average house value of £220,000

‘The research reveals Dagenham is the UK's top burglary hotspot, with a rate of 55 out of every 1,000 insurance quotes having made a claim in the past two years.

The average house value in the RM8 postcode of Dagenham and Becontree  is £220,000, with only five properties estimated to be worth more than half a million.

The average is about a third of the mean price in London of £600,000, according to Zoopla. 

Dagenham, originally a Saxon settlement, was mainly rural until the 1920s when housing estates and the Ford motor factory was built. 

In terms of the number of criminal offences recorded per 1,000 people, the area is said to be worse than the national average in the categories of vehicle crime, violent crime, robbery, anti-social behaviour and burglary.

Its total crime figure is 2.91, which is 17 per cent worse than the national average of 2.48, according to the data website Postcode Area.

All three MPs who cover the RM8 postcode are Labour - those being Jon Cruddas for Dagenham and Rainham, Mike Gapes for Ilford South and Margaret Hodge for Barking.

The area was found to be the worst place in Britain to retire, in a study by Prudential last year. And it came tenth in a list of the worst places to live in England by website ILiveHere.

‘Burglars often target urban areas where there's more hustle and bustle and so less risk of being caught.

‘But not surprisingly they also follow the money, which is why affluent areas such as Teddington and Temple Newsam in West Yorkshire appearing in the top 20 claims hotspots.’

Postcodes in rural Scotland's Dumfries (DG1) and Lochee (DD2), Felixstowe in Suffolk (IP11) and North Wales's university town of Bangor (LL57) are among the areas with the lowest proportion of burglary claims in the UK, according to the analysis.

Those living in the seaside resort of Bognor Regis (PO22) can also feel secure, with a rate of 1.63 per 1,000 and Northern Ireland's Londonderry (BT48), with just 1.36 per 1,000 insurance quotes showing a claim.

Mark Castle, chief executive of the charity Victim Support, said: ‘As a charity that supports thousands of burglary victims each year, we know how devastating an impact this crime can have and we are here to help.

‘Victims tell us that they suffer far more than material loss when their home is burgled - the psychological impact of this crime can be drastic, long-lasting and different for everyone.’

Mr Pratt added: 'Homeowners should be vigilant about home safety wherever they live, by ensuring that security measures have been put in place, and appropriate insurance taken out.
