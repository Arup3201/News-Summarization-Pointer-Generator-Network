Modern Scouts can earn badges in cookery, circus skills and orienteering.

But the skills demanded of a Scout back in 1914 were distinctly different; as members were expected to master the arts in horseshoe fitting, know the dangers of diphtheria and slaughterhouse rules.

The Scout Association has republished a century-old guide that shows just how much the organisation has changed over the last 100 years.

For the Fireman badge, Scouts had to throw themselves from a height of 10ft into a net or sheet.

But they not only had to save their own skins, they also had to carry a boy of their own size down and up 12 steps.

The Blacksmith badge demanded Scouts learn how to make a horseshoe, while the Poultry Farmer badge required Scouts to kill and pluck birds for their dinner, the Sunday Telegraph reported.

The members,  were also taught how to spot the warning signs of ditheria.

Perhaps it comes as no surprise, given that during World War II over 50,000 Scouts were trained to undertake National War Service jobs, including acting as police messengers, firemen and stretcher bearers.

The no-nonsense badges are a far cry from the more varied pursuits of the Association today, which offers members the opportunity to learn about public relations and meteorology.

But whereas the emphasis was on vocational badges in 1914, the Scouts now vary practical badges such as mechanical or nautical skills with more lighthearted hobbies such as crafts.

And while the badges may have changed, so has the historic oath, so that the membership promise can include atheists.

The Scout movement is to preserve the historic promise by its members that they will do their duty to God, its leaders announced in November.

Baden-Powell's Scouting for Boys has sold 150 million copies since 1908, making it the fourth bestselling book of all time after The Bible, The Koran and Chairman Mao’s Little Red Book.

There are only five countries in the world that do not have Scouting – China, Cuba, Laos, North Korea, and Andorra.

In the past one hundred years, over half a billion men and women have taken the Scout Promise.

They bowed to pressure from secular lobbyists and offered boys and girls from atheist families the chance to make a special non-religious pledge when they sign up as Scouts.

But new recruits will continue to make the religious promise unless they ask for the atheist version.

Scout officials said that following a 10-month consultation 'the core Scout Promise remains in place and scouting remains fully committed as a movement that explores faith and religion as a core element of its programme'.

Although the Guides remain an all-female group, Scouts have accepted girls as members since the 1970s and now have more than 77,000 girls among 537,000 members.

The Scout Promise, which dates from the foundation of the movement in 1907, requires that new members declare: ‘On my honour, I promise that I will do my best, to do my duty to God and to the Queen, to help other people and to keep the Scout Law.’

Different versions for the use of Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists have been available since 1960, although all have included a religious reference.

There are also versions for foreign members which allow them to pledge duty ‘to the country in which I am now living’ rather than to the Queen.

The new wording for atheists says: ‘On my honour I promise that I will do my best to uphold our Scout values, to do my duty to the Queen, to help other people and to keep the Scout Law.’
