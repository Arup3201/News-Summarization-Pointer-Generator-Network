A group of Florida fishermen were astounded when they snagged a monster hammerhead shark last week but were even more shocked when they realized the injured beast was ready to give birth and they were going to have to be the doctors.

Noe Campos and his friends had been wrestling with the massive catch for hours off the 700-foot Venice pier when it became tangled on a pole.

Campos threw caution to the wind and jumped into the murky water only to realize the shark was seriously injured and its pups were actually trying to bite their way out of her and into the world.

Shocking catch: Fishermen in Venice, Florida got a 12-foot surprise last week in the form of a hammerhead shark that happened to bite their line

Caught: The fishermen were fishing off Venice's 700-foot pier when the shark became snagged around a pole

Pregnant: The men found a big circular bite out of the shark's belly and sticking out was a hammerhead pup's tail

'It had a big radius bite, a big bite mark taken out of it,' Campos told WFLA.

Even more shocking: they could see a tail sticking out of the hole.

'They were trying to push their heads out, so i'm guessing the mom tried to give birth but she didn't have the strength to push them out,' said Campos.

A shark expert told Chron.com that the hole in the shark's abdomen likely resulted from a bite from another shark that attacked her as she fought against the fisherman's line.

One by one, the fishermen pulled the wriggling babies out of their mother

Bittersweet: All told the fishermen pulled twenty pups from their mother and watched them swim free into the Gulf

The group of fishermen pulled the pups out one at a time until they'd delivered twenty of the wriggling baby sharks that one of the men called 'very alert.'

'I stood in the water for a couple of seconds to make sure they swam off good. I held them and as soon as I put them out, voom! They took off,' remembers Campos.

The mother hammerhead, an endangered species died.

Attacked: One expert noted that the shark was likely bitten, not by her own pups, but by another shark as she fought against the line. She did not survive the injuries
