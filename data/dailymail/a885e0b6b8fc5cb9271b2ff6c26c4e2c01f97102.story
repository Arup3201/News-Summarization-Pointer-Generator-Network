Charlotte Rampling’s sultry looks and risqué nude scenes helped make her an arthouse star in the 1960s and 1970s.

But for her son, Barnaby Southcombe, 42, they only led to years of embarrassment and awkward schoolyard conversations.

And, as the actress, 68, returns to screens in the second series of ITV’s Broadchurch, Southcombe has revealed how his own sons have discovered their grandmother’s raunchy past after stumbling across the photos when searching her name online.

The film director said his reaction when he was young was: ‘It’s like “Oh god, mum!” she’s at it again. It’s embarrassing at the best of times, but when there’ s someone at school who says their father fancies your mum, that’s weird.’

But he added that his own children, Roman, 12, and Gabriel, 10, who call their grandmother Go-Go because she’s always ‘on the go’, are less worried by the images. He said: ‘They laugh at some pictures when they find them. They’re like “Oh, Go-Go!”’

Miss Rampling, a mother-of-two, stripped has off in 12 movies including 2009’s Life During Wartime when she was 64, and posed for Playboy in 1975.

And Southcombe can’t shake off all responsibility for his mother’s racy image, having directed her in a sex scene in his 2012 film I, Anna, something he has previously described as ‘awkward’.

He said his mother has always been keen to help woman be proud of their bodies, adding: ‘She’s all about honest. That’s why she’s against Photoshop and plastic surgery. She taught me to be true, honest. I can be proud I guess, in retrospect.’

Miss Rampling, who recently became one of the oldest women to model for beauty brand L’Oreal, has previously said there is ‘something creepy’ about with face-lifts.

She added: ‘You don’t know what you’re looking at. You think: “Knock, knock!” What’s behind these strange masks? You can’t see the feeling in their faces any more.

‘But if you dare to grow old, there’s something beautiful about it. ‘The creed and the code in Los Angeles is: “Do it!” And if you don’t do it, you’re a renegade. And if you’re a renegade there, where do you go? Europe, I suppose.’

Miss Rampling seems set to keep her clothes on in her latest role as mysterious QC Jocelyn Knight in Broadchurch. The show was welcomed back to screens last week by 7.2million viewers after nearly two years away.

As the formidable lawyer, the actress looks set to prosecute accused murder Joe Miller after his shocking not guilty plea in last week’s episode and will face-off in the court room against a former colleague played by Oscar-nominee Marianne Jean-Baptiste.
