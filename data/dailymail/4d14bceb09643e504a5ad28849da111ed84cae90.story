A father-of-26 dubbed 'Britain's most feckless father' claims he had his enormous brood after a string of casual conquests as a nightclub bouncer.

Peter Rolfe said he could have 'the pick of the women' when he worked as a doorman in London and had sex with 'a different woman every night'.

Now the 64-year-old, who has 14 daughters and 12 sons by 15 women and claims around £46,000 a year in benefits, says he regrets his former lifestyle because he let his children down.

Womaniser: Father-of-26 Peter Rolfeclaims he had his enormous brood after a string of casual conquests as a nightclub bouncer. But he regrets his former lifestyle, saying: 'I've let down my children and I'm ashamed'

'If I would have been responsible, which I should have been, I would not have fathered this amount of children,' he said.

'I was a doorman and you get to pick the "pick of the ladies" if you like, or whatever you want to call it, and any doorman will tell you that.

'You could go home with a different woman every night and I'll be honest, I did for a while.

'But I regret that lifestyle very much because I have lost contact with a lot of my children which I'm not happy with that. I think about those children every day.'

Rolfe - whose lengthy criminal record includes drink driving, handling stolen goods and drug possession - was cleared of bigamy when a 2003 case was dropped for lack of evidence.

Former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe once branded him Britain's most feckless father and said he did not deserve a tent, let alone a council house. 

Rolfe's ex-wife has claimed 'he will carry on having more kids if he finds anyone stupid enough'

Brood: Rolfe - who moved into the house with seven of his children and two grandchildren (pictured) - has always dodged prison sentences partly by claiming he needs to look after his children

He prompted controversy when he moved into a five-bedroom taxpayer-funded home in Newport with seven of his children.

Rolfe, who now has one eye and walks with a stick, told council officials the property he had moved into in September 2011 was 'too small' for his family.

He appeared on ITV's This Morning and a Channel 5 documentary last year saying he wanted a house big enough for his offspring.

But despite having several convictions since 2000 including handling stolen goods, threatening behaviour and having .22 calibre bullets without a licence, Rolfe claims he changed long ago.

'In 2000 I turned my life around and tried to look after these children,' he said. 'I'll hold my hands up, I do admit, I've let down quite a few of my children and I'm ashamed of that.

'I made the decision to not go around chatting up the women or taking the pick of the women from the pubs and clubs I worked in.

'I did decide to try and settle down a couple of times but I didn't work.

Lineage: Rolfe has a lengthy family tree - and many of his children and partners remain unknown

'I have a criminal record for violence and stuff like that, I'm not disputing that. But I turned my life around back in 2000.'

Ex-wife Claire Drake, 43, who had six children with Rolfe in seven years after meeting him in 1992, has described how she could not bear living with him any longer.

The barmaid said previously: 'I had to get away. He's just evil. He should be castrated. He will carry on having more kids if he finds anyone stupid enough.

'It is absolutely disgusting the amount he receives in benefits while I am working for a roof over my head.

'I have nothing but hate for that man. When I watched him on This Morning, I was shaking; my legs were going; and I was sweating. He makes my skin crawl.'
