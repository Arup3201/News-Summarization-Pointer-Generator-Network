A Frenchman who lived in a Paris apartment which was the size of a toilet for 15 years, is suing his former landlord for €25,000, it has been revealed.

The 50-year-old tenant, known only as Dominique, will appear in court on Tuesday to pursue the owner of his former flat for rent reimbursements and damages after he discovered the property was let to him illegally.

Under French law, an apartment must have at least 9 square metres of living space to be put up for rent.

Illegal: Under French law, a property must have at least nine square metres of liveable space but Dominique's flat had just 1.56 metres of habitable room (stock picture)

But Dominique's flat on the 11th floor of a block in the French capital had just 1.56 square metres of liveable room.

By the end of his tenancy in Janary this year he was paying €330 a month in rent, which works out as €211 per month per liveable square metre.

The only furniture or appliances Dominique could fit into the hovel was a mattress, sink and humble hob for cooking.

Speaking to French publication 20 Minutes, Dominique's lawyer Aurelie Geoffroy confirmed the legal action would be going ahead.

Mr Geoffroy said: 'The money entails rent repayment from the last five years, as well as moral harm suffered by my client.

The tenant’s case was championed by French housing charity the Fondation Abbé Pierre.

They are campaigning  to highlight the number of tiny apartments being illegally let to desperate tenants in Paris.

In demand: Living space is so sought after in Paris, above, that tiny rooms are being let illegally for huge rent

Samuel Mouchard from the charity, said: 'When I first saw the apartment, I asked myself "how is this possible"

'Until then the smallest flat I’d ever seen was three square metres, but Dominique broke that sad record'

Speaking after the initial discovery of Dominique's situation in January, Mouchard said: 'Some landlords are unscrupulous. The law is there but it needs to be enforced.

'Tenants need to know that it’s forbidden. If they have doubts they can go to their local Town Hall where measures can be taken to protect them or to rehouse them.'
