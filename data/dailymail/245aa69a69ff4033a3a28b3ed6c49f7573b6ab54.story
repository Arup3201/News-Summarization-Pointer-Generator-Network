Colour: Fake tan has become increasingly popular in Cardiff - or so it seems to letting agents John Winter

It may be the cheap alternative to a sunkissed post-holiday look.

But fake tan is costing one Cardiff landlord thousands of pounds as he is forced to replace mattresses and mattress covers 'decorated' by students after that year-long summer glow.

John Winter, who manages student lets in Cathays, Cardiff, first noticed the problem about four years ago, according to employee Joe Harris.

At the time, the letting agent was having custom-made mattresses that were pocket-sprung, but these were being ruined by the fake tan stains after the colour went through the sheets, according to Mr Harris.

'John [the owner] didn't have a clue 
what the strange orange marks were,' he told the BBC. 'They were roughly body shaped and 
you could see the wrist, ankle and shoulder areas.

'We try to educate the students and it
 has been quite successful because three years ago we had 220 mattress 
covers ruined, but this year that's dropped to 147.

The company has also started using memory foam matresses because covers can be removed and washed or replaced - 'although 
we still have some where the colour has gone right through and ruined 
the whole thing'.

'There is a high percentage of females out of the 400 students we house, so the incidents were much higher, and you could see the fake tanning products in nearly every room,' he said.

'I went to one house and was
 met by a parade of mattresses being carried down the stairs on the way 
to the skip.

'There is a high percentage of 
females out of the 400 students we house, so the incidents were much 
higher, and you could see the fake tanning products in nearly every 
room," he said.

New mattress covers cost around Â£30 
each, plus VAT.

Mr Harris says that he does not see the problem going away until the interest in fake tan wanes.

But beautician Carina Barcoe, who works at Blush Hair and Beauty in Birchgrove, Cardiff, said staining can be avoided.

'Fake tanning will wash off sheets,' she said.

'I always recommend wearing loose-fitting pyjamas though, as different products have different developing times.'

However, Mr Harris said it was impossible to remove the marks from this mattress.

"There are quite a few orange coloured people walking around Cardiff," he added.
