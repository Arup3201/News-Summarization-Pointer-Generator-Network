A week after the nation learned of his wife's months-long affair with CIA boss David Petraeus, it appears as if Scott Broadwell is getting the support he needs.

The husband of Paula Broadwell has been pictured embracing a friend in the doorway of his Charlotte, North Carolina home a day after he returned with his shamed wife and their two sons.

Paula Broadwell, who was photographed on the school run and carrying out errands on Monday as she struggled to get back to normality, has told friends she deeply regrets the damage to her family.

A close friend has revealed Petraeus' biographer-turned-mistress is desperately trying to repair the damage and move forward.

Support: A friend embraces Scott Broadwell at his Charlotte, North Carolina home on Monday - a week after the nation learned of his wife's affair with CIA boss, David Petraeus

After the scandal broke more than a week ago following Petraeus' resignation as director of the CIA, she stayed with her brother at his home in Washington D.C. but returned to North Carolina yesterday.

The family was welcomed by a group of
friends and neighbours on her return, and a friend - who did not want 
to be named - said that Broadwell was overwhelmed by the outpouring of 
support.

Mrs Broadwell maintained her stony 
silence after being confronted by a number of reporters when she pulled 
up in an SUV, according to WSOC-TV.

Her
husband Scott refused to comment, but appeared happy to joke about the 
media circus which has surrounded his family since November 9 - the day 
Petraeus resigned.

Heading out: Broadwell has been seen outside her home several times since returning from D.C. on Sunday

Broadwell was wearing large sunglasses and showed no emotion as she tried to hide her face from waiting photographers.

Scott was asked: 'Is there anything at all you'd like to say, Scott? Now's your chance, this is it.'

But after pausing for a moment, he simply replied: 'No comment at this time.'

He later returned to the driveway to 
take groceries out of the car and joked with reporters, saying: 'I'll be
out here Tuesday taking out trash, if you want to shoot that.'

The doctor revealed that the family would be releasing a statement soon, but did not elaborate on when it would be.

'Regret': Broadwell returned to the family home on Sunday night and is said to be sorry for the affair

Heading out: Photographers swarmed Broadwell's home as she left for the school run on Monday morning

The couple were seen in public for 
the first time on Saturday night returning to her brother's $2.3million 
home after apparently going out for dinner in the Washington area.

Looking stern and taking the lead 
from her husband, Mrs Broadwell did not speak to the gathered news 
reporters as she marched into her sibling's home.

It
was the first time that Paula had been seen since Tuesday evening, when
she was photographed wearing a hot pink top in the kitchen of her 
brother's home.

She had been holed up there since 
returning from what was supposed to be a romantic get-away with Scott to
celebrate her 40th birthday - which was curtailed when news of the 
Petraeus affair broke.

Friends and family of the pair told 
reporters in the wake of the affair revelations that the Broadwells had
built a happy home in Charlotte, where they live with 
their two sons, Lucien 6, and Landon, 4.

The radiologist works at a hospital 
in the southern city and the 43-year-old and his wife  'love 
to do Crossfit, run, ski and surf together.' according to a biography of Paula Broadwell published by the University of Denver.

In
January, while promoting her biography of Petraeus, Mrs Broadwell told the Charlotte Observer that she met Scott in 
Germany and described them both as 'adventure junkies.'

At
an alumni event for the University of Denver in October, Broadwell said
it was 'very difficult to start a family' when the two of them were on 
active duty.

Paula Broadwell and her husband Scott parked their car in the garage at her brother's Washington D.C. home and then entered in through the back yard entrance

'We had decided before we got married
that every other move would be the other person’s choice, since we are 
both very career-oriented,' said Paula Broadwell at the event. according
to the Daily Beast

'And he chose Colorado, he chose Denver.'

They
moved into their $800,000 two-story brick home in Charlotte's Dilworth 
suburb in 2009 and Scott became an employee of Charlotte Radiology at 
the same time.

In the 
January interview with the Charlotte Observer Broadwell said that when 
she was abroad with Petraeus in Afghanistan, Scott and her mother took 
care of their two sons.

Scott Broadwell and his wife have also been involved in a number of groups that work to benefit veterans of the armed forces.

Speaking out: Friends revealed that Broadwell deeply regrets hurting her family and hopes to move forward

Found! Paula Broadwell was photographed on 
Tuesday inside her brother's Washington D.C. house

Since the affair broke, their home 
has been empty and visible on the driveway is power-washed writing, 
which reads in a flourishing font: ‘Dad loves Mom.’

Paula Broadwell's affair with 
Petraeus was exposed after she sent a series of messages to Florida 
socialite Jill Kelley, apparently warning her off her lover.

The messages, which have been described as 'kind of cat-fight stuff',  had been sent anonymously to an account shared by Mrs Kelley and her husband, but FBI investigators traced them to Broadwell.

In one of the 
emails from Broadwell to Kelley, she accused the Florida housewife of touching 'him' underneath a table 
and another email asked if Kelley's husband was aware of her actions, 
according to the Wall Street Journal.

In another, the biographer of the 
former CIA director was apparently aggressive towards Mrs Kelley, 
saying: 'Who do you think you are?'

Deception: Paula Broadwell is married to a 
radiologist, Scott Broadwell (left), and they have two young sons 
together, while Petraeus has been married to Holly for 38 years. They 
have two grown children

Broadwell watching as Petraeus and his wife Holly arrive for a Senate 
Select Intelligence Committee hearing on Petraeus' nomination to be 
director of the CIA

She also accused the socialite, a 
Petraeus family friend, of 'parad[ing] around the base', adding: 'You 
need to take it down a notch.'

Kelley has denied being any more than
friends with Petraeus and released a statement saying: 'We and our 
family have been friends with Gen. Petraeus for over five years.

'We respect his family’s privacy and want the same for us and our three children.'

It
also emerged that Broadwell sent an email anonymously to General 
John Allen, who has been accused of swapping thousands of 
'inappropriate' emails with Kelley. It was traced back to Petraeus' 
mistress and he discussed it with Kelley, it is claimed.

In fact the bombshell of the illict 
affair that rocked the nation broke when Broadwell and her husband were enjoying a two-day break at the Middleton Inn in Little 
Washington, Virginia.

Sources told the Washingtonian.com 
that the couple had enjoyed 'strenuous' bike rides, champagne and cozy 
dinners since arriving at the luxury inn last Thursday evening - the day
before the scandal hit the news.

The
couple reportedly joined other guests at the Inn for breakfast - but by
the time they returned from a romantic dinner last Friday evening, they
were described to the magazine as 'not being in very good moods'.

They
left abruptly last Saturday morning and were allegedly on their way to 
DC. A party had also been planned for Mrs Broadwell's birthday on 
Saturday night - but it was cancelled.
