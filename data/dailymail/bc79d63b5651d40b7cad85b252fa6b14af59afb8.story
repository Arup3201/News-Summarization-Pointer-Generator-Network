A young single mother died after mixing cider, beer and Lambrinis with amphetamines and heroin during an impromptu party with friends, an inquest heard.

Former A grade college student Karayn Mcinerney, 20, was found dead in bed at a friend's flat in the village of Heaton, north of Bolton, by a former flatmate after a night out.

Miss Mcinerney, whose eight-month-old daughter was being looked after by a relative at the time, was at least three times over the drink-drive limit and had traces of amphetamine and morphine in her system, Bolton Coroner's Court heard.

An inquest into her death heard that the once-promising student's life changed dramatically when her grandmother, who had brought her up, died, and Miss Mcinerney began associating with 'the wrong people'.

Miss Mcinerney was brought up by her grandparents after her mother abandoned her and enjoyed a happy and successful childhood until the age of 12 when her grandmother died, quickly followed by her grandfather.

Her aunt, Emma McInerney, told the hearing: 'Everything started to go wrong when she lost her gran -
it was like losing a mother.

'She started 
associating with the wrong people and started to drink.

'We all struggled very hard. Her 
friends were the wrong friends. She found it difficult living where her 
grandparents lived, so exchanged it for a flat. She stopped going to 
college.'

In November 2012, Miss Mcinerney gave birth to her baby girl and her family hoped she would get back on track.

But on April 19 this year her 
brother Aaron, 29, agreed to take his niece for the night so his sister 
could go out with friends.

The inquest heard from Miss Mcinerney's former flatmate Tiffany 
Stevens, who said she had joined her for a drinking 
session at a friend's flat after a night out in Bolton town centre.

She said the group drank cider, beer 
and Lambrini, and said Miss Mcinerney was very drunk.

'She was acting like 
crazy,' said Miss Stevens. 'She said her stomach was hurting and she went
to the bedroom on her own.  I went to the room later.

'When I did she looked asleep.  I thought she had fallen down the side of the bed and was asleep.'

The next day Mr Mcinerney tried calling his sister to arrange for her to pick up her daughter, but was told by a female who answered the phone that she was still asleep.

His evidence read in court said: 'At 
3.30pm the same girl was crying and said an ambulance had been called 
because she wasn't breathing.'

He rushed to the flat and was
told by a paramedic that his sister had died.

Police found snap bags used to carry drugs, and drug-taking accessories including burnt tin foil and a crack pipe in the flat where she died.

Recording a narrative verdict Bolton coroner Alan Walsh said Miss Mcinerney died from a misuse of amphetamines and alcohol.

He said: 'She was a young woman who had a rollercoaster life where, as a child, she had been brought up by her grandparents. Her grandparents did a very good job by looking after her and making sure she got an education.

'She became involved with associates who weren't good for her. She was known to drink from a young age because of these associations.'

He added: 'Her daughter was the catalyst for her to change and in the early stages she did change. She was very committed to being a mother - but you can't control who she gets in touch with. The combination of drugs and alcohol was a disaster.

'It was a sudden, unexpected and tragic death - tragic for her at the age of 20, tragic for her lovely daughter at eight months. That is the saddest part of her death.

'I don't believe the family could have done any more... It is the loss of a very young life and the life of a young mother.'
