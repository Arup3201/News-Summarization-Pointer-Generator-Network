An artist fascinated by the effect the digital world is having on human interactions has published a short film of people's last cell phone photos.

Ivan Cash was blown away by how open and honest people he approached in San Francisco's streets were, sharing personal stories, some touching, some funny.

From one night stands, to moments of natural beauty, an office picture to prove a boyfriend was at work and not cheating, to a bent-over stripper - the collection is a glimpse into moments in people's every day lives.

Speaking to the Mail Online, Mr Cash, 27, said his project was to raise awareness of the friction between 'human inaction and interaction and the role of the digital medium plays in it'.

He said there was a certain 'irony' that 'technology that's trying to connect us more... can also pull us apart'. For example, he said people on Facebook may have hundreds of 'friends' but have little human interaction and connection with them.

Mr Cash has been coming up with local interactive art projects in his San Francisco home for several years, self-funded and in his spare time. He has recently also completed a similar project, asking people to share and explain their last text message.

'Both projects are based on the idea that we all have our phones on us at all times. Most of us have smart phones so we can stay connected at any time. But the irony is, when you look around in a public space, half the people are on their phones, and it feels really isolating when people are not open to what's going on around them.'

Mr Cash has urged others to follow his lead and expand upon the project, by asking people in their neighbourhood to share their last phone photo and explain the significance of it. In doing so he hopes to create more human interactions.

He said: 'I hope at least there's a dialogue about it, or it starts a conversation about it,' he said, adding, 'I hope that other people go out and explore their surroundings.'Â

On a personal note, Mr Cash said he found the project 'gratifying' since it's rare for his projects, which focus on human interaction in the digital media, to get him outside and physically meeting people.

Many people he stopped in the street were happy to give him the time to share their last phone picture and explain it on camera. But some were too busy, and others, due to the content of the pictures, were not willing to share it.

One man who didn't share his photo, but who is in the film, said it was a picture from a one night stand, of a woman who is now 'stalking' him. Another had a photo of a friend prior to going in for a face-lift procedure, and decided it wasn't fair to make it public.

But more often than not, Mr Cash said he was overwhelmed by how cooperative people were and how they were so willing and open to sharing such personal information about snap-shots of their lives.

One woman had recently visited her late husband's gravestone and had taken a picture of it; another shared a story about being high on mushrooms and taking a picture of a dead crab having pieced its limbs back together on a beach.

Mr Cash, who works as a freelance creative for advertising and technology companies, has invited others to watch his videos and create and share their own similar projects.
