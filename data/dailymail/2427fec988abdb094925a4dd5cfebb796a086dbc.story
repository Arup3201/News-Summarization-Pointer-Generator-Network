Life expectancy in five Western countries

It may be the most powerful country in the world, but American men are dying earlier than in other Western nations.

And, shockingly, deaths come almost 30 years earlier than the international average in a fifth of counties across the U.S.

The average age to which an American male can expect to live is just over 75 and a half years, but that is quite a bit younger than their Japanese counterparts who can hope to make it to 79.

And the difference between women is 
even greater with American women looking at living nearly 81 years 
compared to just over 86 years for a woman from Japan.

Life
expectancy IS improving in the U.S., but not at the same rate as other 
Western countries meaning that the gap is getting wider and it is 38th 
in the world for life expectancy.

Comparisons with similar countries such as Great Britain, Australia and even Canada are less than favourable.

The
university study into average ages said: 'Large disparities in health 
outcomes have been documented in the U.S. in relation to race, community 
of residence, and individual and community socio-economic factors.

'Our
analysis shows that community-level disparities in 2007 cover a range 
of global health experiences - from counties with life expectancies 
better than the best-performing nations to those lagging behind these 
nations by 50 or more years.

'The extent of geographic inequality is substantially larger in the US than in the UK, Canada, or Japan.

'Equally
concerning is that between 2000 and 2007, more than 85 per cent of 
American counties have fallen further behind the international life 
expectancy frontier, of which 55 per cent were statistically significant
at the 90 per cent confidence level.

'While the US and most of its communities fell further behind, the US maintained its position as the country that spent the most per capita on health care throughout this period.'

Where people live in the U.S. has a significant impact on how long people can expect to live with some places being 16 years ahead of the average compared with others being 47 years behind.

The figures come from a study by the University of Washington in Seattle and Imperial College, London. They questioned the effects of smoking, hypertension, diabetes, physical inactivity, obesity, cholesterol, diet and alcohol.

The report said: 'At the national level, these risk factors together lead to close to one million premature deaths.

'If the leading four risk factors were addressed (smoking, high blood pressure, elevated blood glucose, and adiposity[obesity]), life expectancy in 2005 would increase 4.9 and 4.1 years, respectively, for males and females.'

Obesity and smoking are among the reasons why Americans have a lower life expectancy than other Western nations

The study on average ages across the world comes on the back of a study by the OECD which looked at past and projected obesity rates.

The findings are similar and show America's rising overweight population as being bigger than other countries, followed by England, Canada, and Australia respectively.

One suggestion for addressing the problem is to distribute wealth more evenly.

Human geography Professor Danny Dorling, from the University of Sheffield, said: 'Top income groups are badly affected because their doctors are not necessarily mainly interested in their health but work for organisations that have to make an income.

'I am not suggesting it is deliberate but you make more money out of a patient who spends more on many drugs and investigatory operations than one who lives longer with less intervention,' he told the BBC.

Link? The U.S has more obese and overweight people than any other country

As the age gap widens between America and the rest of the world, the U.S. continues to get fatter

'In a more equal system the rich who are well get less intervention - and they live longer in the UK than the U.S.'

Researchers carried out a similar study in 2007 and both men and women came out 37th in the world with a range between different counties of more than 15 years.

They found then and now that people in the Deep South, particularly around northern Texas, had the lowest life expectancy in stark contrast to countries along the Eastern Seaboard.

There are also clusters of people living longer in Colorado, Minnesota, Utah, California, Washington, and Florida.

Just 0.2 per cent of the population of Britain and two per cent of Canadians have life expectancies are more than 30 years behind the international average compared to 17 per cent of US counties for men.
