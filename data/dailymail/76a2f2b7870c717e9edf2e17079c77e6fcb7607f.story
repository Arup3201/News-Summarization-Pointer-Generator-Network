An Arkansas mother is pushing for a 'child abuse registry' to be implemented in her home state to protect other families from the 'monster nanny' who terrorized her child and may now be free to harm others.

Whitney Matney, a 28-year-old lawyer from Springdale, Arkansas, went through every parent's worst nightmare in 2012 when, using a hidden camera, she caught her former-nanny Melissa Medema violently shaking and spanking her screaming one-year-old daughter Raylee. 

Melissa, also based in Springdale, was arrested and as part of a plea deal was sentenced to 90 days in jail and three years probation, after which she can have her record expunged and her past buried.

'The fact that this monster - there’s no other way to describe her - if this monster can walk around, watch other children and have no ramifications at the end of four years, it’s just beyond insane,' Whitney told ABC News.

Because Raylee, now three, wasn't physically injured in the attack, Melissa was able to plead guilty to the least serious felony permitted by the law, a class D 'endangering the welfare of a minor' charge.

Since she pleaded guilty and it was her first-time offence, Melissa's record can be expunged altogether after her four-year probation is up in 2017, under Arkansas' Act 346.

And since there is no publicly accessible online registry for child abusers in the U.S. - only one for sex offenders - Melissa could work as a nanny again for another family without that family knowing about her past.

Cruel: Whitney set up a nanny-cam - a device which looks like an alarm clock but conceals a hidden camera - and captured Melissa carrying Raylee around 'like a rag doll' as she cried (pictured)

Aggressive: Melissa then violently shakes little Raylee from side to side as she screams in distress

Busted: Melissa, who was a former high school classmate of Whitney and had undergone background checks before being hired, also spanked Ralyee in the footage (pictured)

Whitney hired Melissa, who happened to be a former high school classmate, in October 2012 after posting the job to her Facebook account.

The cautious mom, relieved that this was an acquaintance and not a complete stranger, ran a background check on Melissa, got a reference and set up a trial session with her and Raylee.

At first, things seemed to go well and Melissa was hired, but things soon took a turn for the worse when Raylee began acting strangely.

According to Whitney, her daughter starting screaming and crying as soon as Melissa would arrive to look after her - something her doctor suspected was separation anxiety.

Melissa would also claim that Raylee was taking four-hour naps, something that set off immediate alarm bells for Whitney, since her daughter never napped for much more than an hour.

Brazen: Raylee was rushed to the hospital and underwent a series of testing, but fortunately was given the all-clear. Pictured, Melissa inspects the nanny-cam

Suspicious, Whitney set up a nanny-cam - a device which looks like an alarm clock but conceals a hidden camera.

At the end of the first day of surveillance, Melissa  discovered the nanny-cam and turned the camera lens to face the wall.

'My heart leapt in my throat,' Whitney said when she noticed it had been flipped round. 

Upon watching the footage, the frantic mother witnessed Melissa leaving Raylee in her bouncer for two hours, spanking her and then aggressively shaking her 'like a rag doll.'

Raylee was rushed to hospital and underwent a series of testing, including an MRI, but fortunately was given the all-clear.

Fortunate: The police offer who attended the scene told Whitney: 'I think if you hadn't caught this when you did, you would have come to no baby anymore.' Pictured, Raylee now with her dad (center) and mom (right)

Action plan: Whitney states, 'In 2015, we’re going to send out a bill asking that [Arkansas] implements the child abuse registry so that parents can check before they leave their children with a [carer]'

Cuddles: According to her parents, Raylee (pictured) is now a 'happy and healthy' three-year-old

Melissa was arrested when she brazenly turned up to work two days later, and later pleaded guilty to endangering Raylee's welfare.

She has now completed her jail sentence and is still on probation. 

When ABC confronted her outside her Springdale apartment, she stormed into her home and then called the reporter.

'This is Melissa Medema and you came to my residence this morning,' she said. 'First of all, I do not appreciate that. Do not come back to my residence, do not contact me.'

Raylee is now a 'happy and healthy' three-year-old, and Whitney has been working with Arkansas lawmakers, Representative Greg Leding and Senator Jon Woods, to push new legislation.

'In 2015, we’re going to send out a bill asking that they actually implement the child abuse registry,' Whitney says. 'Arkansas will be the first state to have one, if it passes.

She added: 'I want all of the states to adopt it. What I want is for anybody who has been criminally convicted of child abuse, or any crime against a child, that they be listed on that registry so that parents can check before they leave their children with a babysitter, a nanny, a neighbor.'
