Unemployment in Greece climbed to a new record of 26 percent in September, topping that of Spain to become the highest in the euro area.

Greece’s jobless rate has almost tripled since September 2009, driven higher by the global financial crisis and severe austerity policies imposed by the bailed-out country’s international lenders.

The Greek Statistical Authority said that 1.295 million people were recorded as being unemployed in September, pushing up the jobless rate up from 25.3 the previous month and 18.9 percent a year earlier.

The country's largest labor union, the GSEE, has predicted the jobless rate will reach 29 percent next year.

Unemployment is more than double the euro zone average of 11.6 percent, edging past the rate in struggling Spain, which was 25.8 percent in September, according to data from European statistics agency Eurostat.

The Greek economy is now in its fifth year of recession and is expected to have shrunk by almost a quarter before recovery begins in 2014, according to the country’s central bank.

This has taken its toll on the labour market, especially for the young. Unemployment among those aged 15-24 stood at 56 percent in September, compared with 22 percent in the same month four years ago.

A record 1.3 million Greeks were without work in September, up 38 percent from the same month last year, ELSTAT said.

Savvas Rombolis, head of labor research at the union, told private Skai radio: 'According to our calculations, the recession next year will be between 5 and 5.5 percent ... The money being taken out of the economy due to higher (taxes) is driving the recession.

'So more businesses will close, more people will lose their jobs, and fewer graduates will find work.'
