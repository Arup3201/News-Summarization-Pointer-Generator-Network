When Lin Boutcher put her three-bed country home up for sale in 2004, she expected no trouble at all finding a buyer.

She thought someone, perhaps a retired couple looking for some solitude, or a young family looking to escape the rat race, would soon meet the £175,000 asking price for the well-kept and charming rural retreat in the sleepy Welsh village of Gwytherin.

But after 10 years on the market, Mrs Boutcher and her husband Keith, 41, are still in the home - and believe potential buyers are put off because it 
is so rural that it has no mobile signal and very slow broadband speed.

Idyll: But the three-bed country home in a sleepy Welsh village has had hardly any interest in the decade it's been for sale

The owners believe buyers are put off by the lack of infrastructure in the countryside - it is five miles from the nearest town

The couple, who have a nine-year-old son called Louis, believe their home, located on the edge of the Snowdonia National Park in North Wales, must hold the British record for a house that has been on the market for the longest time.

They have had the old village post office repainted and decorated and it has parking and a back garden - but it also overlooks a graveyard which could also be putting people off.

The mother-of-one is desperate to move closer to her relatives - more than 250 miles away in the South East of England.

And she admits she might have to slash the asking price again in a bid to finally sell the house -  - which at times has been priced as low as £163,000.

In 2004 the house went on the market for £175,000, falling to £163,000 in around 2007. By 2011 as the housing market recovered the price was back up to £167,500 and is now on sale for £175,000 again.

The owners refitted the bathroom and kitchen, installed double glazing and enhanced the central heating in a bid to sell

Still on the market: The asking price for the Boutcher's Welsh home

Lin, a marketing executive, said: 'The property has barely generated a flicker of interest since it first went on the market.

'We believe it is a perfect country getaway. But rather than helping to generate interest, the property’s rural location is putting people off.'

Lin and her husband moved to the house - called the Old Post Office - after inheriting it from his parents.

The house had 'chronic damp' but is now in 'A1 condition' after the couple overhauled it.

The house is five miles from the nearest town, has 'patchy and unreliable' mobile phone signal and the broadband speed is around 15 times lower than the UK average.

Housing experts said they are baffled by the lack of a buyer for the house.

Tony Filice, spokesman for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: 'Ten years would have to be a record.

'In the last recession it wouldn’t have been uncommon for a house to have been on for two or three years but that was because of the economy.

'But it is unheard of for a house to be on the market for a decade.'
