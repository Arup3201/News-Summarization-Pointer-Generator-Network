A legendary and outspoken Jewish comedian is blasting President Barack Obama – and the Hollywood community – for letting Israel twist in the wind following Benjamin Netanyahu's stunning re-election on Tuesday.

In a radio interview set for broadcast on Sunday, Jackie Mason complains that Obama 'doesn't see that Hamas is a problem. ... He doesn't care that they want to wipe us out.'

'I'm not saying he is on the side of the people who literally want to wipe us out,' Mason cautioned, 'but if he's not on their side, it's certainly hard to tell which side he's on. Because you don't hear him attacking the Hamas half as much as he is attacking Bibi Netanyahu.'

Mason phoned the Tel Aviv-based Aaron Klein Investigative Radio program from his home in New York City. Daily Mail Online heard an advance copy of the segment.

BITING: Comedian Jackie Mason lashed out at Barack Obama, saying 'you don't hear him attacking Hamas half as much as he is attacking Bibi Netanyahu'

FINGER POINTING: Obama has been on a  streak of aggressive reactions to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's come-from-behind re-election on Tuesday

The sharp-tongued comedian focused on the White House's continued objection to settlements build by the Israeli government in places the Palestinian Authority considers 'occupied' territories.

'How often have you heard him say "We have to do something because we have to put a stop to Hamas's aggressions"? To Hamas bombing Israel every day? To all the bombs that are falling?' Mason asked.

Radio host Aaron Klein scored the interview with Mason, who called the Tel Aviv-based program from his New York City home

'I never heard him complain. You know what he complains about? A settlement was extended. Two more toilets were added to a certain settlement. And a kitchen was extended on the other side.'

'Between the kitchen and the toilets, that's creating the whole problem,' he fumed. 'And there's too many kitchens and too many toilets.'

He said Obama's 'design is to intimidate the prime minister of Israel. ... He wants a peace-making process that will leave Hamas intact and [so] that the enemies of Israel shouldn't be too disturbed.'

'"Just because they want to squash Israel or eliminate Israel",' Mason imagines Obama saying, "there's no reason why they shouldn't be given a chance to operate".'

The 83-year-old had his claws out for Hollywood as well, saying America's entertainment moguls – even those who are Jewish – tend to be aligned against Israel.

'The truth of the matter is that Hollywood is basically anti-Semitic,' he claimed.

'It's hard to believe that a Jewish organization like Hollywood – Hollywood was created by the Jews and they were the original creators of almost all the major studios of Hollywood. ... Almost every studio is either a partner with a Jew, or a Jew is a boss, or a Jew is involved in it. ... The Jews were always attracted to show business. So what do you think happens?'

NO SETTLING: Hamas and other Palestinian factions continue to clash with Israeli soldiers in 'occupied' territories as they object to new housing erected by Netanyahu's government

They've changed their politics, he told Klein, 'as they became richer and richer without working for a living ... Where else do you know a person who is not too bright, and never went to college or went to school and cant talk English and is a total moron or an idiot. And he becomes a star and two minute later he is getting $20 million a picture.'

'Now we expect these people making $20 million a picture who are comparatively retarded – how will we expect them to suddenly make sense when it comes to the state of Israel?'

'When you make this much money for nothing, you feel guilty and you feel like you have to prove you are a humanitarian. So you have to start forming organizations that help the underdog,' Mason said. 'And they convince themselves that the Palestinians are the underdogs.'

'How they became the underdogs nobody knows. But they feel they are being persecuted by the Israelis. Because the Israelis are too successful. And they've done too well. And they can't identify with people who are doing well because they feel guilty for making all this money for nothing so they have to help the underdog.'

Aaron Klein's show is broadcast on New York's AM 970 'The Answer' station and on Philadelphia's NewsTalk AM 990.

Mason is set to be in London June 1-3 performing a standup routine at the Adelphi Theatre.
