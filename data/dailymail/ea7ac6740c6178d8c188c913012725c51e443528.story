A TV chef was embroiled in a race row last night for referring to boxer David Haye as a ‘monkey’.

Rosemary Shrager, 61, used the offensive word in an ITV2 interview after she was voted off I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here!

She said: ‘I have to just say this live on television – David is such a hunk!’ Bursting out laughing, she added: ‘I’m a middle-aged lady, and I saw him coming through the jungle, like this monkey!

‘But lovely, you know, he looked so fit, and I thought, this is terrific.’

Laura Whitmore, who was interviewing her, looked flustered after Mrs Shrager’s outburst, fanning her face with her notes and saying: ‘This conversation is a bit … whoof, we’d better move on from this.’

Viewers took to internet forums and social networking sites to express their dismay.

Chloeb said on Digital Spy: ‘I just had to rewind ... did Rosemary say seeing David was like seeing a monkey?’

Jambob replied: ‘Rosemary is just a bit oblivious, sure she isn’t aware of the offensive connotations.’

Lostindex added: ‘She said that too. Horrifying!!! Hope it gets picked up on.’

And Cassy990 said: ‘Awkward moment to say the least, clearly she didn’t engage her brain when she said that!’

Viewers also took to Twitter to express their shock.

Daniel Maxwell added: ‘Wow. Rosemary Shrager just described seeing David Haye walking through the jungle like seeing a monkey!!! Can’t say that these days Rosie!’

But others dismissed the fuss, saying she had not said it out of racism. Scott Geller said: ‘I’m pretty certain it was harmless but I smell a storm-a-brewin’.’

Mrs Shrager, who survived for 12 days before her eviction, had an argument with fellow contestant and former Made In Chelsea star Hugo Taylor which appeared to turn viewers against her.

Earlier this week the show’s producers were accused of cruelty for using seven-year-old Kiki, the daughter of actress and jungle competitor Charlie Brooks, as a prize during a game to win luxuries. Hundreds of viewers complained on discussion forums.
