Heart failure brought on by syphilis claimed the life of one of the UK's top composer, it has been claimed.

In a new book to mark what would have been Benjamin Britten's centenary year, author Paul Kildea claims that by the time he was diagnosed he was beyond treatment.

In his book Benjamin Britten: A Life In The Twentieth Century, Mr Kildea claims that Britten contracted the disease from his long term partner Peter Pears.

Secret: Author Paul Kildea claims Britten was never told he had syphilis because he was beyond treatment

Britten died in 1976 having never fully recovered from heart surgery three years earlier because of the disease he was carrying.

According to the book, Mr Pears never knew of his condition either and carried the disease without showing any symptoms. 

Mr Pears died a decade after Britten - who is credited with composing some of the finest music for the voice ever written and for a revival of English opera - and was buried next to him at Aldeburgh, Suffolk.

Mr Kildea told the Guardian: 'It was a series of tragedies, syphilis did not kill him, but it meant that his heart was not in the condition required to recover fully from the procedure he underwent and from which his consultant (though not his cardiologist) expected him to make a full recovery.'

The composer's former assistant Colin 
Matthews, who is now on the board of the Britten-Pears Foundation, which
promotes the pair's work, said that he believes the claims are 
'probably true'.

He added he is unsurprised that the decision was taken by doctors not to tell Britten 
of his condition given the stigma then attached to the disease, and that 
treatment would have had no effect.

Mr Matthews said: 'Nothing could be 
done. In those days people would undoubtedly have been shocked, and to 
people of a certain generation it may still seem so today.'

In the biography, Kildea says that Britten predicted his own ill health while working on Death In Venice in 1971.

Syphilis is the oldest recognized STI and can result in death if untreated.

The bacteria that cause syphilis are called Treponema pallidum. They can enter your body if you have close contact with an infected sore, normally during sex.

Syphilis has three stages which can overlap and are not always experienced in the same sequence.

Generally however, the first stage begins with a painless but very infectious sore on the gentials or around the mouth. It lasts between two to six weeks before disappearing.

Secondary symptoms include flu-like symptoms such as fever, a skin rash and sore throat. These tend to disappear after a few weeks. There is then a latent stage that can last for years.

The third stage is the last and most dangerous - it affects around a third of people who are not treated for the STI.

It can damage the brain with symptoms ranging from tremors to mood disorders causing ravings and muscle weakness. Syphilis also has a tendency to damage the walls of the aorta, the artery that leads from the heart. It can also cause blindness. The third stage can develop up to 25 years after the initial infection. 

Between 2009 and 2010, there were 2,624 cases of syphilis diagnosed in the UK.

If caught early the disease can be easily treated with antibiotics, usually penicillin injections.

Mr Kildea makes the assertion that Britten may have suffered from syphilis from as early as 1940.

He
writes: 'It seem likely that as he sweated and hallucinated his way 
through a bout of streptococcal tonsillitis in the early months of 1940,
only two years after his heart was given the all clear and just as he 
was about to write his love song to Pears, Seven Sonnets of 
Michelangelo, his body was in fact reacting to syphilis, now in its 
secondary stage. All the symptoms were there.'

The book, which is published on February 7, is being serialised by the Telegraph prior to its release.

The centenary of Britten's work is to be celebrated in 12 months of dedicated programming from the BBC.

The Suffolk-born dentist's son showed
musical talent from a young age and went on to be a key figure iof 
classical music in the 20th Century.

His
earliest attempt at a composition, entitled Do You No[sic] That My 
Daddy Has Gone To London Today, came in 1919 when he was just 
six-years-old, and two years later he began piano lessons.

Britten
attended the private school South Lodge, where he had viola lessons, in
his home town of Lowestoft, and later became a border at Gresham's 
School in Norfolk before being awarded a scholarship at the Royal 
College of Music in London.

A
visit to the Norfolk and Norwich Festival in 1924 had left a lasting 
impression on a young Britten after hearing the orchestral suite The Sea
by Frank Bridge. His viola teacher introduced him to the composer, who 
had taken the budding musician under his wing.

Britten, who became the first composer to become a lord when he was given a life peerage in 1976, had his first composition - Three Two-part Songs' which set three poems by Walter de la Mare to music - published in 1932.

He began working at GPO Film Unit, writing music for the 1936 documentary Night Mail, which also featured poetry by W. H. Auden.

Sufferer: Mr Kildea believes that Britten may have had syphilis from as early as 1940

The composer met Pears, a young singer, a year later when a mutual friend Peter Burra died in a plane crash, and the pair struck up a friendship ahead of a homosexual relationship.

The couple, who moved to the U.S. in 1939 before returning a few years later, both registered as conscientious objectors during the Second World War.

Britten made a name for himself in 1945 with Peter Grimes, credited by the Britten-Pears Foundation for putting 'British opera back on the map'. It was first performed at Sadler's Wells in London.

Another piece, Glorianna, was performed at the Royal Opera House in the capital to celebrate the Queen's coronation.

Britten - interviewed by police in the 1950s over his homosexuality but was never charged - and Pears set up the Aldeburgh Festival in 1949, having moved to the Suffolk seaside town. New works by Britten were regularly performed at the festival.

During his remarkable career, some of his most celebrated works included The Turn Of The Screw, Death In Venice, A Midsummer Night's Dream and Noye's Fludde - described as the first community opera, having been written for a church or large hall, with parts for younger performers.

He was also asked to write for the renowned cellist Mstislav 'Slava' Rostropovich, and in 1962 completed the powerful choral masterpiece War Requiem, which mixes the Latin requiem mass with Wilfred Owen poetry.
