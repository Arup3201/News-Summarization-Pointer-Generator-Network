Thousands of over-55s will be unable to access new pension freedoms in April because there are still gaping holes in the Government’s policy, it is claimed.

Britain’s insurers say neither they nor the Government will be ready when the radical reforms are introduced in just six weeks’ time.

In a startling admission, the industry body for pensions firms say ‘critical pieces of the jigsaw’ will not be in place when the changes ‘go live’ on April 6.

Last March, Chancellor George Osborne made the surprise announcement that over-55s would be able to withdraw their pension and spend it as they wished, rather than being forced to buy an annuity.

It followed criticism that annuities, a guaranteed income for life, had become poor value for money.

Under the plans, people should be able to dip into their pension whenever they like, with 25 per cent of any withdrawal tax-free.

But the Association of British Insurers will use its annual conference today to say missing details mean it is ‘impossible’ to say the new freedoms will be available on time.

The ABI pointed out that the Government’s guidance service, which offers free information on the reforms, still had no phone number just 40 days before the rules change, meaning there is nowhere for pension providers to direct people to if they did not have internet access.

Insurers also have little information on how the guidance, called Pension Wise, will work and how consultations will be logged so insurers know what had been discussed with customers.

Providers are also still waiting for ‘critical rules’ from the Financial Conduct Authority on what information they must give to customers before allowing them to withdraw their cash.

But critics have also accused insurers themselves of ‘dragging their feet’ and failing to adapt to the reforms quickly enough.

Pensions’ expert and government advisor Ros Altmann, said: ‘The fact that Pension Wise is not yet fully operational should not stop pension firms from helping their customers to benefit from the freedoms.

‘Some firms are moving with the times whereas too many others are just staying with the status quo which has suited them so well for so long but has not necessarily been in customer interests.’

The uncertainty will raise fresh doubts over how many people will actually be able to use their pension like a bank account, as has been suggested by ministers.

Dr Altmann said she feared many pension firms would not allow their customers to switch to a flexible income drawdown schemes, forcing customers to move.

Millions are stuck in older schemes that will not let them swap. These savers may incur exit fees worth up to a fifth of their pension pot if they move to a more flexible company.

Others will be forced to wait while their provider decides if it will accommodate the reforms.

Many pension firms have already admitted they will not make the changes by April, if at all.

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘We have already seen firms announce new products for April 2015, launched the first arm of the guidance service – the Pension Wise website – and are on course to meet demand for face to face and telephone guidance in April.’
