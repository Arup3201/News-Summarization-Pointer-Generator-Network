A man saved his best friend's life after a holiday heart attack - by burning his flip-flops to grab the attention of a rescue helicopter.

Fishing harbour workers Rich Jago and John Peplow had just set up camp on a remote beach near Rock, Cornwall, when 51-year-old Mr Peplow was struck by sudden chest pains.

Quick-thinking Mr Jago called 999 and performed first aid despite not doing so since he was a child, before burning his sandals on a fire to draw the attention of an RAF rescue helicopter.

The friends of 30 years, who both work at Brixham Harbour near Torbay, Devon, went for a weekend break on August 1 and were on a beach away from the main road.

Marine painter and father-of-two Mr Peplow said: 'If it was not for my mate I would be dead. He saved my life.

'We had decided get out of Brixham for the weekend and went down to Cornwall to chill out.

'We had put the tents up and had gone down to the beach after 1pm.

When Mr Peplow was struck with sudden chest pains, Mr Jago carried out first aid on his friend and even burned his sandals so they could be seen from the air

'I had started to roll a cigarette, but said to Rich, "can you roll this for me as I canâ€™t", and then felt pains in my chest.

'The next thing I know, I have passed out on the floor and am having a heart attack.

'Rich was pumping my heart and kept me awake. Luckily he had his phone with him and managed to get a reception and called the ambulance. I was kind of dead on the beach.'

An air ambulance was dispatched but was 
unable to land, so an RAF Sea King helicopter was called which took Mr 
Peplow to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro.

Mr Peplow said: 'If it was not for my mate, I would be dead. He saved my life'

He was released from hospital this week and returned home yesterday.

Mr Jago, 45, who unloads fishing boats at Brixham Harbour, said: 'The last time I did any first aid was when I was in the Boys' Brigade. I called for an ambulance but we were three fields over so told them we needed the air ambulance.

'I was waving frantically to them to attract their attention as they flew over twice.

'I threw my flip flops into a fire to create some smoke to attract their attention.

'The air ambulance was unable to land though, so they had to call for the Sea King helicopter to come. It landed and then stabilised John.

'They appeared to give him an aspirin and that seemed to bring him around.'

The weekend did not improve for the devoted friend - whose car broke down on his way to visit Mr Peplow in hospital.

Mr Peplow added: 'I would like to thank everyone who helped save my life. Rich, the Sea King helicopter, the air ambulance, and the staff at Royal Cornwall Hospital, who were all brilliant.

'I will be on tablets for the rest of my life, but I thought I was gone.'
