Theresa Moran Camera, left, allegedly let her three-year-old son pump gas by himself last month

A mother allowed her toddler son to handle a gasoline pump unsupervised, causing the three-year-old to spray fuel all over himself, police alleged today.

Theresa Moran Camara, 46, was charged by Manheim Township Police in central Pennsylvania for endangering the welfare of a child.

Police say they were called to a Giant supermarket on January 19 and determined that the boy removed the nozzle from the vehicle without releasing the handle.

Witnesses said that as a result, gasoline was sprayed all over the child, LancasterOnline.com reported.

Police surveillance video further confirmed eyewitness account, and showed a woman allowing a small child to pump gas into a Toyota Rav4, the Smoking Gun reported.

Camara told police that she had ‘allowed her son to help her in pumping gas and confirmed that he had sprayed gasoline onto both of them,’ according to the affidavit. 

The vehicle had left by the time police arrived, but witnesses gave investigators a license number.

The Pennsylvania woman was filling up her Toyota Rav4 at this Giant supermarket gas station in Lancaster County on January 19

Court officials say Camera doesn't have a lawyer on file, and a home listing for her couldn't be located.

Lancaster County was formed in 1729, and is located between the state capital of Harrisburg and Philadelphia.
