Laughed 'psychotically': Cady (pictured here in court just after crash) refused to slow down before causing crash that killed three of his friends

An injured passenger involved in a car crash that killed three people has revealed that his dunk driving friend laughed 'psychotically' before speeding off the road.

Trevor Rodgers also claims that when  William Daniel Cady was asked to slow down by the five people in the vehicle he responded by saying 'I'll drive this f***ing car however the f*** I want'.

The group of six had been to three bars around San Diego before piling into the Cadillac Escalade on the night of January 10.

Mr Rodgers said Cady, 25, was driving 'pretty fast' as they exited northbound Interstate 805 and took the transition ramp to westbound state Route 52 on the way home to Clairemont.

He said: 'When we came around the turn, I noticed that the whole vehicle kind of lurched, like when you take a turn at unsafe speed.

'At that point we got scared - we asked him to slow down. He was laughing like it was a big joke. We were going really, really fast.'

After cursing at his five passengers, Cady soon lost control of the SUV, San Diego Superior Court heard.

The vehicle veered off the road and up a dirt embankment before rolling over several times as it was hit by other cars,

Four of the passengers were hurled from the vehicle as it spun, with two of them -  Taylor Bednarski, 29, and Shon Gilliam, 23, both of San Diego - being killed in the process. 

A third passenger, 35-year-old Jeffery Becker, of Kern County, died in the crumpled wreckage. 

He was the only person in the SUV wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash, according to the California Highway Patrol. 

Mr Rodgers' testimony came on the first day of a preliminary hearing held to determine whether enough evidence exists for Cady to stand trial on felony charges that include gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated.

The witness, 26, was also seriously injured in the crash, suffering a broken ankle, arm and pelvis - which required him to remain in hospital for 15 days. 

Cady suffered black eyes and a neck injury - which have since healed. 

California Highway Patrol Officer Brad Clinkscales testified that he visited Cady in the hospital on January 13 and left a digital recorder in the room after the patient declined to talk to him, 10news reports.

On the tape, Cady was heard saying that he could not believe he had killed three people and that he would surely go to prison.

On the recording he says: 'Oh my God, my life is over. I've done it to myself. Why? I'm a bad person. I hate cars. Cars are no good.'

Earlier on the night of the crash, a barmaid has claimed she refused to serve the group as they were too drunk, instead offering them credit with which to get a taxi home.

They refused - instead moving on to another bar. 

Speaking at San Diego Superior Court, she claimed she never served Cady but that it seemed like he was 'under the influence of something'.

She said: 'He was stand-offish, had clammy hands, was kind of sweaty-looking, wasn't interacting and was on his phone.

'He looked kind of angry, irritated.'

Cady's defence counsel has highlighted that the barmaid did not serve him any alcohol and say their client is sick with guilt and grief. The trial continues.
