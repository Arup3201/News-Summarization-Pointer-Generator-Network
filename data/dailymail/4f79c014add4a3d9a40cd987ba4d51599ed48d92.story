Nick Clegg was slapped down by David Cameron yesterday after saying Britain was ‘losing the war on drugs on an industrial scale’.

In an extraordinary intervention, Mr Clegg suggested the Prime Minister lacked the ‘courage’ to order a major review of drugs policy.

The Liberal Democrat leader threw his weight behind a controversial report by MPs which suggested decriminalising the possession of small quantities of drugs.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the war on drugs had failed, costing 2,000 lives a year and making billions for criminals

And he backed the report’s call for a Royal Commission on the issue to reconsider all aspects of drugs policy.

But he was given short shrift by the 
Prime Minister, who rejected the report’s findings this week and 
insisted drug policies were ‘working’.

Speaking in Brussels, Mr Cameron said 
his deputy was ‘entitled’ to his views, but made it clear he would have 
no influence on drugs policy this side of the election.

He said: ‘Of course the Deputy Prime 
Minister is entirely entitled to take a view for the next election and 
beyond for his manifesto, wanting to go further, wanting a Royal 
Commission.

Mr Clegg made his surprise intervention in the drugs debate while David Cameron is out of the country, attending an EU summit in Brussels

‘I am very happy to debate and discuss drug policy. I think the Coalition Government has taken a series of good steps.

reclassification of ecstasy.

Mr
Cameron said at the time of the report: 'I hope that our report will 
encourage fresh thinking and a new approach. We need to get away from 
entrenched positions and try to reduce the harm that drugs do both to 
users and society at large.'

‘I think that the right answer would be 
for cannabis to be a class C drug, because it would send the right 
message about the dangers of using the drug, but a separate offence will
be needed to deal with the specific problem of large-scale dealing, 
with a different maximum sentence attached to it.’

November 2005Asked about downgrading ecstasy from Class A to B:‘Yes. I think that is right, looking at the science.’

June 2011‘I
do not believe that we should legalise any drugs that are currently 
criminal, but I do believe that drugs policy has been a failure over 
recent years.’

December 2012‘I don’t support decriminalisation. We have a policy which actually is working in Britain.‘I don’t rule out taking more steps, 
but I don’t personally think a Royal Commission is the answer and I 
don’t support the decriminalisation of any drugs that are currently 
illegal.’

As a backbench MP a decade ago, Mr 
Cameron backed calls for the downgrading of both cannabis and ecstasy. 
Yesterday he acknowledged he had said ‘all sorts of things about drugs 
policy over the years’, but insisted he was now against 
decriminalisation of any sort.

In a thinly veiled swipe at the Prime 
Minister, Mr Clegg hit out at politicians who called for drugs reform in
opposition only to abandon the issue when they got into government for 
fear of being painted as ‘soft’.

‘For too long people in politics have 
worried that saying something differently can somehow look like you’re 
being soft,’ he said.

‘It’s important now to pluck up the 
courage to speak out.’

Mr Clegg, whose party first adopted a policy to 
decriminalise cannabis possession a decade ago, added: ‘If you were 
waging any other war where you have 2,000 fatalities a year, your 
enemies are making billions in profit, constantly throwing new weapons 
at you and targeting more young people, you’d have to say you are losing
and it’s time to do something different.

‘I’m anti-drugs – it’s for that  reason I’m pro-reform.’

The Lib Dem leader has ordered Home 
Office minister Jeremy Browne to compile a report on liberal approaches 
to drugs across the world which have worked, including in Portugal, 
Amsterdam, Latin America and several US states.

Challenged over taxpayers’ money  
being spent on sending Mr Browne around the world to research changes to
drug policy opposed by the Prime Minister, a Downing Street spokesman 
said: ‘It is the Government’s role to keep policies under review and to 
ensure that they are meeting what is required, but the Prime Minister’s 
view is that the policy is working.

‘It’s part and parcel of a minister’s job to make sure that they look at examples of policies in different countries.’

Legalise it: Some say a legalisation of drugs would prevent a black market and benefit Britain whilst anti-drugs charities say it will flood the country with drugs

Committee chairman Keith Vaz

The home affairs select committee 
this week set out a series of controversial recommendations, insisting 
government drugs policy is ‘simply not working’ and ministers should 
consider decriminalisation.

Committee
chairman Keith Vaz (pictured) said: ‘Drugs cost thousands of lives and 
the taxpayer billions of pounds each year. This is a critical, now or 
never moment for serious reform.

'If we do not act now, future generations will be crippled by the social and financial burden of addiction.’
