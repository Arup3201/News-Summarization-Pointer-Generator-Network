He is well known for his holiday fashion faux pas.

And as his latest family photographs show, David Cameron has once again managed to put his foot in it.

Posing in a battered pair of open-toed leather sandals, the Prime Minister showed that when it comes to dressing, there are some things he has yet to learn from his time in office.

Mr 
Cameron, who was ‘chillaxing’ in Cornwall on his third holiday this 
year, was again shown up by his wife Samantha, who looked stylish and 
relaxed in skinny-fit jeans and flip flops.

It not the first time that he has fallen foul of the footwear fashion police.

During a 
similar photo call in Lanzarote earlier this year he was mocked for 
sticking to the same clunky loafers he had been spotted in on previous 
holidays. It seemed the camel-coloured £20.99 Aldo shoes had become a 
staple of the prime ministerial holiday wardrobe.

His 
fondness of his shirt-and-suit uniform has diminished little over the 
last four years. And the awkwardly posed photos of his array of 
short-sleeved blue shirts  – not to mention unconvincing poses in local 
fish markets – have become par for the course.

This is despite the ample practice Mr Cameron has managed to squeeze in during his time in office – a total of 15 breaks.

The PM showed off a pair of brown sandals, which make a change from his usual choice of block work shoes with jeans

Over the 
years, his fashion faux pas have ranged from wearing his smart black 
work shoes sockless in the Mediterranean heat to donning grubby running 
trainers and white socks for a walk around a Spanish town. In his first 
year in power, and the year his fourth child Florence was born, Mr 
Cameron managed only one trip to Cornwall.

But he 
made up for it the following year with no fewer than five holidays as he
 took his family to Malaga, Cornwall, Ibiza and celebrated Mrs Cameron’s
 40th birthday in Granada before spending a fortnight in a luxury 
300-year-old villa in the Tuscan countryside.

On more 
than one occasion, he raised eyebrows at home by being seen going 
sockless in the same black work shoes paired with formal trousers and a 
crumpled blue shirt – despite the heat.

In 2012, Mr Cameron’s holiday plans were curtailed by the London Olympics, which dominated the summer.

But he still managed a trip to Mallorca with the family ... and another trip to Cornwall.

On this 
holiday and in another  unfortunate series of photos the Prime Minister 
was spotted on the beach changing out of his swimming trunks – and using
 a well-positioned Mickey Mouse towel to protect his modesty.

The next 
year saw another return to Cornwall, a stay in an £11,000-a-week villa 
in Ibiza and holidays to the Portuguese Algarve and to the island of 
Jura in Scotland.

His latest
 trip to Polzeath, Cornwall, is the Prime Minster’s third holiday of the
 year so far. He has previously visited Lanzarote and Cascais in 
Portugal. In 2012, Mr Cameron said he was a ‘great believer’ in 
politicians taking holidays. He added: ‘If you don’t think politicians 
ought to have holidays, I think you need to have a  serious think.’

The 
family’s spring break in Lanzarote this year may have been particularly 
calming as they stayed in a rural yoga retreat. Mrs Cameron is 
understood to have fallen in love with the idyllic destination.
