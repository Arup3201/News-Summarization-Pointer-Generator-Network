The earliest recorded supernova was viewed by Chinese astronomers in 185 AD, but today stellar explosions can be captured using telescopes - even those small models set up in amateur astronomers' gardens.

This incredible series of photographs were shot from one man's back yard and show spectacular clouds of gas surrounding stars.

Eric Coles captured supernovae, which are normally invisible to the naked eye, over the course of the past year from his home in Illinois.

Out of this world! This incredible series of supernovae photographs were shot from a back garden and show spectacular clouds of gas surrounding stars. A supernova is the explosion of a star and the largest explosion that takes place in space.They are often seen in other galaxies but are problematic to spot in the Milky Way because dust blocks our view

The 70-year-old research chemist used different filters on this five telescopes to draw attention to the shapes and patterns created by different gases that have absorbed energy from nearby stars.

‘I shot these images from the comfort of my back garden and because I love to see the pretty figures and shapes in the night's sky,’ Mr Coles said.

‘The gases, hydrogen, oxygen and sulphur in these nebulae absorb the light energy from the nearby stars and re-emit it at very distinct wavelengths,’ he explained.

Starry eyed: Eric Coles captured supernovae, which are normally invisible to the naked eye, over the course of the last year from his home in Illinois, USA. The 70-year-old amateur astronomer used different filters on this five telescopes to draw attention to the shapes and patterns created by different gases that have absorbed energy from nearby stars

‘I shot these images from the comfort of my back garden and because I love to see the pretty figures and shapes in the night's sky,’ Mr Coles said. ‘The gases, hydrogen, oxygen and sulphur in these nebula adsorb the light energy from the nearby stares and re-emit it at very distinct wavelengths,’ he explained. Two of his works of art are pictured above

To get his professional-looking images, Mr Coles takes three separate images using his array of telescopes, sometimes on different nights. He uses filters to select different wavelengths and then layers up his images to make the perfect picture (shown above)

‘My filters select for each of these wavelengths. So I take three separate images, usually on three separate nights to get the perfect images.’ 

The telescopes are connected to a computer, which applies a colour to each filter. Mr Coles then combines the images so that one multi-coloured picture including all three gases is made.The images are called Hubble palette pictures.

Mr Coles spends all night out on his deck taking pictures with an exposure as long as 15 minutes. It has to be very long to allow as much light in as possible, so the telescope has enough light to capture the shapes clearly. One picture can be the culmination of three nights or up to 20 hours work. 

A supernova is the explosion of a star and the largest explosion that takes place in space. They are often seen in other galaxies but are problematic to spot in the Milky Way because cosmic dust blocks our view.

A supernova (pictured) occurs in two different ways when there is a change in the core of a star. The first type happens in binary star systems - two stars that orbit the same point - when one of the stars - a white dwarf - steals matter from its companion. Eventually the white dwarf acquires too much matter and explodes in a supernova

Alternatively, an explosion is caused at the end of a star's lifetime. As it runs out of nuclear fuel, some of its mass flows into its core, which becomes so heavy that it can't withstand its own gravitational force. The core collapses, resulting in a supernova.

Scientists study supernovae (pictured) to learn more about the universe. One kind of supernova has shown scientists that we live in an expanding universe that is growing at an ever increasing rate

Scientists study supernovae to learn more about the universe. One kind of supernova has shown scientists that we live in an expanding universe that is growing at an ever increasing rate. Scientists have also determined that supernovae play a key role in distributing elements throughout the universe.

When the star explodes, it shoots elements and debris into space that travel through space to form new stars and planets.

Scientists also have determined that supernovae (pictured) play a key role in distributing elements throughout the universe. When the star explodes, it shoots elements and debris into space and many of them found on Earth are made from the core of stars. These elements travel on to form new stars, planets and everything else in the universe
