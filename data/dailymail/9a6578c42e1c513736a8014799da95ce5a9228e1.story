Wimbledon stars are in uproar over their undies – after stricter enforcement of the all-white dress code forced some to go bra-less.

Others have protested that making them wear white knickers under a white dress creates a see-through effect when they perspire.

Tighter guidelines were introduced after concerns that sponsors were taking liberties with the dress code and sneaking more colour into players’ outfits in a bid to promote their brand.

It means every article of clothing needs to be white – leaving no room for misinterpretation.

But reigning ladies champion Marion Bartoli, who is not competing this year after retiring from the sport, said women players were up in arms over the new rules, which risked compromising their dignity.

And former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash
 claimed his trademark black-and-white check bandana would be banned 
today, adding that the guidelines were ridiculous and had gone too far, 
in an attempt to return to tradition.

The new rules – the strictest in 
tennis – state ‘white does not include off-white or cream’ and that a 
single trim of colour around a neckline, cuff and sleeve can be no wider
 than one centimetre.

It
 found fame as Henman Hill. Now Aorangi Terrace, the knoll overlooking 
No 1 Court, is officially Murray Mound – on Google Maps. A user put the 
name on the site last year when Murray won the men’s singles.

Tickets
 for the men’s final on July 6 were being offered online for £17,000 
yesterday – 115 times face value. Centre Court  tickets for tomorrow, 
when Andy Murray is  due to play, were  priced at £1,800

Even caps, headbands, bandanas, wristbands and socks must be white, apart from the one-centimetre strip of colour.

Cash revealed that some of the men were upset over the rules as well, saying: ‘One of the players was called into the referees’ office because he had blue underwear that showed through when he got sweaty, so he was told not to wear dark underwear.

‘Some of the girls have been told to go back and change their bras and tops because they had slight colour on them.

'I believe some of the girls didn’t have suitable sports bras and had to go without them. It has absolutely gone ridiculous.’

Britain’s Naomi Broady wore no bra when she was defeated by Caroline Wozniacki on Wednesday, although it is not clear if this was because it did not meet the rules.

Earlier this week, Venus Williams led a dress code rebellion by threatening to wear bold animal print underwear beneath her tennis whites.

Miss Williams, 34, admitted on Twitter that she planned to test the rules and also posted a photo of bright pink and orange tie-dyed sports bras.

An Italian player was yesterday hit with the biggest-ever Wimbledon fine – after suggesting an umpire had too much gel in his hair.

Self-confessed ‘hothead’ Fabio Fognini, 27, was ordered to pay £16,000 following an outburst during his first round match.

He told ground supervisor Wayne McKewen in Italian that he wanted to break his racket on his head, after he was warned about throwing it.

He then said to umpire James Keothavong: ‘When you get up in the morning, all you think about is putting gel in your hair.’ The fines will be docked from the £71,000 the World No 15 is guaranteed for reaching the third round.

Tennis fans criticised a ‘cringeworthy’ BBC interview with Andy Murray which was carried out by a dog puppet.

The two-minute chat with Children’s BBC character Hacker T Dog was aired during the highlights programme with John Inverdale on BBC2 on Wednesday night.

Commentator John McEnroe seemed bemused by the piece, joking that the BBC was ‘eating up our time’ while it gets ‘a dog to interview Murray’.

Meanwhile Twitter users expressed their dismay, with one saying: ‘This is making me incredibly uncomfortable.’
