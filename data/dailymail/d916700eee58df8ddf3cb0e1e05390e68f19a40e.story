A woman who had spent a desperate day trying to get home to pick up her sick daughter was given a place on an overbooked flight after the CEO of Delta airlines give up his own seat.

Jessie Frank wrote an open letter on her Facebook page about how Richard Anderson decided to free-up the extra seat by sitting in the cockpit with the pilots.

She was on her way to collect her daughter, who suffers from type 1 diabetes, from a camp for children with the condition.

Mrs Frank was number eight on the standby list, but was suddenly allowed onto the plane and helped with her bag by Mr Anderson.Â 

Surprised but grateful: Jessie Frank (left) had been waiting for a flight home to Atlanta all day when the CEO of Delta Airlines gave up his seat for her

After a travel day full of lengthy delays, cancellations, and mechanical failures due to the weather, Ms. Frank wrote that she was relieved to find that somehow, despite being eighth on the standby list, a spot had opened up for her.

'As the plane descended into Atlanta, the flight attendant announced that there was a special guest on board,' Ms. Frank wrote.

'He was riding in a jump seat, because he had given up his place to allow one more person on that flight.'

'Suddenly I realized that 'familiar face' was not an off-duty pilot,' Ms Frank wrote in her Facebook post.

'It was you, the CEO of Delta, vaguely familiar from the safety video. It was you, Richard Anderson, who gave up your seat for me. It was you, the Delta CEO, who helped me with my bag. It was you, acting just like an ordinary Mr. Anderson, who showed me to my seat.'

Act of kindness: CEO Richard Anderson decided to use the jump seat in the cockpit in order to free up the extra seat. He did not even tell Ms. Frank who he was

'You, Richard Anderson, the CEO of Delta, did all that for me, just an average, middle-aged, woman with, as far as anyone at Delta knew, no special reason to get home,' Ms Frank added.

'But more importantly, it was all of your employees that day that did so much helping me to get home -- and now I know why. Because Delta is led by you, Richard Anderson, a dedicated and inspiring leader who so clearly demonstrates, at his very core, that he leads by example, and does not set himself above all those who allow this airline to exist.'

Since posting the letter, it has been shared over 1,700 times.

In the letter, Ms. Frank says that she really wanted to pick up her daughter, who suffers from Type 1 diabetes, from camp.

'Camp Kudzu gives my daughter five days a year when she feels 'normal,' Frank wrote.

Loyal to Delta for life: Ms. Frank says she had been at DC all day long and was eighth on the standby list so was very surprised when a seat opened up just minutes before the flight departed

One thing after another: Ms. Frank had been stuck in Washington D.C. all day and many flights had been cancelled due to mechanical problems or weather so she was lucky to get a seat at all

'Pick-up day gives me a glimpse into that special world where she's just like everyone else, and she's a little bit of a different person for the rest of the day.'

'By the next day, it's back to the harsh realities of managing a difficult, deadly, incurable disease that kills one in 20 before the age of 18," Frank continued.

Ms. Frank had been traveling from New York when she had been rerouted to Washington, where she was stuck waiting for hours at Reagan National Airport before being led down the jet way only to be told there were no seats left after all.

Then, something happened. A flight attendant paused, talked to someone and then waved her onto to the plane as she was told that room had become available.

She wanted to share her story with Delta and reposted her letter on Delta's Facebook page. It has received personal thanks from Delta employees.

Delta Airlines confirmed the incident, but said that Mr Anderson wished to avoid the spotlight and would not comment on the good deed.

Ms. Frank usually flies Delta and says she doesn't expect to hear from Mr Anderson, but she hopes her letter ends up on his desk so he knows how much she appreciated the gesture.

'I had my special day with my special child. You and your employees gave us both one more day of happiness, and for that, we are both very grateful,' Frank wrote. 'I have always been a loyal Delta customer, but Thursday solidified that loyalty for life!'
