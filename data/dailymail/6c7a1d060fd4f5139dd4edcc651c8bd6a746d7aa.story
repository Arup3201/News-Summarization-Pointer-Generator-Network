Admiral Nelson's warship HMS Victory could feature on the new 12-sided pound coin, it has emerged.

The warship is an early front-runner to be used on the reverse of the new 'threepennybit'- stye coin after the city of Portsmouth launched a design bid.

The warship, which is now a major tourist attraction, was victorious in the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar, during which naval hero Lord Nelson was shot dead by a French soldier.

Historic: The warship, which helped Britain to a decisive victory during the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar, has been included in a proposed design for the new 12-sided pound coin

Portsmouth City Council has announced its ambition to see the ship featured on the coin, which is expected to come into circulation in 2017.

The south coast city's famous Spinnaker Tower is also incorporated into the design.

Councillor Gerald Vernon-Jackson, leader of Portsmouth City Council, said: 'I want Portsmouth to be first off the starting blocks for this competition. We'll push for a 'Pompey pound' with a design celebrating our city.

'HMS Victory is world-famous and symbolises our amazing heritage as the home of the Royal Navy, while the Spinnaker Tower has become an iconic modern image for the whole of the south of England.

Battle: The stand-off between the Royal Navy and the combined fleets of the French and Spanish Navies took place on the Cape of Trafalgar, off the south-west coast of Spain

'Portsmouth has played a pivotal role in the history of this country. With two huge new aircraft carriers soon to arrive, and all the new investment coming into the city, it's entering a new era. Its significance as a city should be recognised in this way.'

The decision to replace the pound coin 
with a new 12-sided version was made after a Dutch smuggling ring 
flooded Britain with £30million in fake currency.

The £1 coin has been in use since 1983 – 
much longer than the normal life cycle for legal tender of its value – 
and 1.5billion were in circulation as of March 2013.

The outdated 
technology used to make the coin leaves it vulnerable to sophisticated 
counterfeiters.

Out with the old: The present £1 coin, left, 
will be replaced to allay concerns about counterfeiting. Its replacement
will be a reworking of the old-fashioned threepenny bit, which last 
circulated in 1971

It is claimed the decision to replace the
 familiar round coin came after Dutch police raided what was previously 
thought to be a legitimate mint in Amsterdam and discovered 
sophisticated machines which could produce hundreds of coins every 
minute, and matched the standard of those used by the Royal Mint.

But industry chiefs insist the bill for 
converting parking meters, vending machines and phone boxes to take the 
new £1 coin could be as much as £100million.

More
 than 100,000 parking machines will need to be changed at a hefty cost 
to local council tax payers, diverting cash from other work, such as 
filling pot holes.
