A trainee hairdresser was presented with a £10,000 ‘indecent proposal’ from her married boss to sleep with him, a tribunal was told.

Maryam Mashayekhi said she felt ‘totally humiliated’ by the lewd behaviour of her manager Christopher Story.

He allegedly questioned her about her sex life in front of colleagues and told a client she was a prostitute.

Mrs Mashayekhi, 34, described how she 
and father-of-two Mr Story were waiting to style a bride’s hair on her 
wedding day when he asked: ‘How much money do you want to have sex?’

She replied she wouldn’t do that for anyone because she was married.

She said he then asked: ‘Are you 
having sex for £1,000, what about £2,000 or £10,000?’ She responded: 
‘No, not even for £20,000. I love my husband.’

The claim echoes the 1993 film 
Indecent Proposal in which a billionaire (Robert Redford) offers a 
down-on-their-luck couple $1million if he can sleep with the wife (Demi 
Moore).

Mr Story, 39, allegedly tried to pass 
off his comments as a joke, but the trainee said she was sexually 
harassed, bullied and humiliated over a six-month period by the 
franchise owner at the Toni & Guy salon in Sheffield city centre.

Mrs Mashayekhi claimed there was another incident involving Mr Story on the same day as the indecent proposal.

She said they were sitting in a car 
waiting for a friend when a woman looked out of a window at them. ‘Mr 
Story got hold of some money, gave me the money as if he was paying me, 
got hold of the back of my head and pushed it down towards his groin,’ 
she said.

‘I was horrified by this and 
immediately pulled away. He said he was having a joke and giving the 
lady something to look at. I was absolutely livid.’

The tribunal heard she was asked by a 
businessman in the salon one evening what she did before working there 
and Mr Story interjected with the comment: ‘She is a prostitute.’

The former artist, who has been 
married for eight years, worked on average 67 hours a week for low pay 
after starting in the salon in May 2010, the Sheffield hearing was told.

Weeks into the job Mr Story asked 
about her sexual preferences in front of colleagues, it was alleged. ‘I 
was shocked,’ said Mrs Mashayekhi, who was born in Iran and came to 
Britain in 2005. ‘I don’t know the culture but in my culture you are not
talking to people like that.’

She said he called her ‘stupid’ on a daily basis and she lost her self-confidence as a result.

Mrs Mashayekhi said he asked if she 
was claiming benefits and she replied that she had to make ends meet. He
allegedly replied: ‘You’re just like these Asians that come over here 
to claim benefits. You’re just a scrounger like the rest of them.’

She was signed off work with severe 
depression in November 2010 and never returned. She is claiming sex and 
race discrimination against Mr Story and George Plus One Ltd, a 
franchise of which his accountant wife Samantha is the sole director.

Mr Story said her description of the 
alleged ‘indecent proposal’ was ‘wildly inaccurate and extremely 
offensive’. He said: ‘I did not offer to pay her in return for sex nor 
did I push her head towards my groin.’

However, the tribunal was told sexual 
banter at the salon was commonplace. Mr Story said in a statement: ‘Many
of the staff are young and the topic of conversation can sometimes 
relate to sex.’

Hannah Steer, reception manager at the
salon, said she had never known Mr Story speak to anyone in the manner 
described by Mrs Mashayekhi.

She said that days before she left Mrs
Mashayekhi had broken down in tears and told her and Mr Story that her 
husband had a gambling problem and she suffered mental abuse from him.

The tribunal continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
