This time last season there was sudden hope for Manchester United, too. From the mist of poor football and modest results emerged a 3-0 home win against Olympiacos in the Champions League. Glimpses of what we presumed was the real United were seen once more.

A win at West Ham followed in the Barclays Premier League but then the opposition hardened.

Manchester City arrived at Old Trafford and took another huge chunk out of United’s credibility. It was a crushing loss for United from which they, and manager David Moyes, never recovered.

Once again this weekend, United will attempt to build on something they hope will prove to be of substance.

Last weekend’s surprising 3-0 dismantling of Tottenham Hotspur has lifted spirits for Louis van Gaal and his team, but once again opposition of real calibre threatens to cast a shadow across United’s new dawn.

And this time it is the greatest foe of all. Liverpool. The very mention of their name is enough to harden a Mancunian stare. ‘They will always be our greatest rivals,’ Sir Alex Ferguson used to say. 

At Anfield on Sunday, Liverpool and United begin in earnest a fight not for a League title or European eminence but for respectability. A scuffle for a top-four place is one motivated certainly by money but more by old-fashioned pride.

For United, to finish outside the Champions League places once again is unthinkable. If they really are to find the form they will need to see them through an uncomfortable run of fixtures between now and the season’s end, one feels it really needs to start here.

‘The win (against Tottenham) means nothing if you lose the next one and Liverpool is not a ground where this club has won a lot,’ said Van Gaal. ‘If we show that form again in Liverpool then we are little bit further along. For our fans, it’s the enemy and it’s very important.

‘But the last time they lost in the league was against us. It was a long time ago so this will be very difficult.’

Liverpool have issues of their own to deal with between now and mid-May. Raheem Sterling’s contract stand-off will worry them while Steven Gerrard’s farewell from the club this summer needs to be handled properly. 

On the field, though, Liverpool have the better form. Monday night’s win at Swansea was a little fortuitous but Liverpool are now unbeaten in 21 domestic matches and if that’s not daunting enough, they play exactly the kind of football the modern United hate. ‘I have played their system,’ said Van Gaal. ‘It’s not new.’

Nevertheless, while his own side currently tends to play football by numbers — methodical and at times predictable — Liverpool are more instinctive.

Ironically, that was evident the last time Liverpool lost in the league, at Old Trafford back in December. The score was 3-0 to United that day but it was totally unrepresentative of the match pattern as their opponents began to use a three-man defensive line which manager Brendan Rodgers has stuck with ever since.

‘I was impressed that day,’ said Rodgers. ‘The result wasn’t great and we had criticism because we lost but I was pleased with how dynamic the team looked.

‘We looked fast again. That gave me the real confidence. I knew I needed to be radical because we were so far off from where we wanted to be. It’s about putting in place something the players can fully believe in.’ 

United manager Van Gaal will have to be on guard against an in-form Liverpool unbeaten in 2015 in the league

Liverpool play quickly and love to go on the counter-attack, which Van Gaal will have to prepare his team for

Liverpool, as we know, play quickly, love to counter and have the kind of midfield runners who trouble earnest but limited defensive midfield players such as United’s Daley Blind.

If United are to profit on Sunday they must hope to take their opportunities and defend resolutely.

It can be done, of course. For all Liverpool’s attacking prowess, they can have days when they hit brick walls, days when the timing is out. 

Rodgers still has not fathomed a Plan B and it’s worth noting that for all the plaudits which followed Liverpool’s recent win at home to Manchester City, both goals came from distance.

United do generally defend well and their goalkeeper remains on form. The save David de Gea produced from Santi Cazorla towards the end of United’s FA Cup defeat at home to Arsenal 11 days ago was testimony to that.

A year ago, good goalkeeping was not enough to help United mask their deficiencies. As it turned out, their victory over Olympiacos was little more than a shaft of light during a season that resembled a nine-month eclipse.

This time we still don’t know which way they are heading. On Friday night, Van Gaal suggested Sunday will not be definitive.

‘The fight will last until the end,’ he said. If it does, given their fixture list, the United manager will have done very well indeed.
