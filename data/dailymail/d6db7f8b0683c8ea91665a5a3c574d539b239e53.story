When it comes to weddings, it does not get more glamorous than one involving the Grantham family.

Now prospective brides can add a bit of Downton Abbey style to their big day by hiring the tiara adorned by Lady Mary when she tied the knot with Matthew Crawley.

But the 45-carat diamond headpiece will set brides back a staggering £126,000.

Bride: The tiara worn by Michelle Dockery on Lady Mary's wedding day is available for £1,250 a day

There is a £125,000 deposit for the must have wedding accessory and costs £1,750 a day to rent.

Mothers
 of the bride can also replicate the Dowager Countess' sophisticated attire as 
the tiara worn by Dame Maggie Smith in the Christmas special is also for
 hire – at a whopping £5,700 a time.

A source said: ‘Americans are particularly keen on the tiara as Downton is huge over there.’

Bentley & Skinner said: ‘The items are also being used in lots of fashion shoots.’

The tiaras have been worn by a number of celebrities during red carpet events and parties.

Emma Watson, Liz Hurley, Emma Thompson and Helena Bonham Carter have all adorned the stunning pieces.

The item worn by Lady Mary is popular because it can break into two pieces and form bracelets.

The 130-year-old firm, which is based in London, collaborated with Damien Hirst in 2007 and created a diamond-encrusted skull.

Lady Violet: The headpiece adorned by Dame Maggie Smith, who plays the Dowager Countess of Grantham, is also available from high-end jewellers Bentley and Skinner

Sparkling: The 45-carat diamond tiara. The jewelers advise customers to take out temporary insurance when they hire the items

They specialise in fine antique jewels and also provide valuations for insurance and probate.

All of their jewellery is available to hire and they advise customers to take out temporary insurance on the items.

Michelle
 Dockery, who plays Lady Mary in the period drama, said she felt like 
Kate Middleton when filming scenes for the wedding in the ITV show's 
third series.

The British 
actress claimed she was surrounded by an enormous security detail 
because the crew did not want anybody to see her outfit before the show 
aired.
