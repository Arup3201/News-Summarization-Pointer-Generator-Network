Anna Marczuk-Franczak, pictured after her arrest, has been jailed for wounding a man by stabbing him at a party in Nelson, Lancashire last year

A Polish woman repeatedly jailed for violence in her home country stabbed and nearly killed a man after moving to Britain unimpeded, a court has heard.

Anna Marczuk-Franczak, 39, served at least three prison stretches in Poland for a series of attacks dating back to 2002.

But after being released from her most recent sentence in eastern Europe, she moved to Britain and attacked a man with a 30-inch kitchen knife in Nelson, Lancashire.

A judge in Preston has now jailed Marczuk-Franczak for two years for the stabbing, whose victim suffered a 10cm-deep wound to his chest.

The  crown court heard Marczuk-Franczak had invited Piotr Kolodziejski and his girlfriend, Magdalena Swistowksa, to her home in Nelson to celebrate the Feast of St Anna last July.

But the celebration quickly sour as Marczuk-Franczak became 'melancholy', complaining that her husband was still in Poland and a current boyfriend was also away, the court heard.

After a row broke out, Marczuk-Franczak armed herself with a 30-inch kitchen knife and stabbed Mr Kolodziejski to the chest.

The knife thrust 10cm downwards from his neck into his chest cavity narrowly missing his vital organs.

Mr Kolodziejski was rushed to hospital and was saved by doctors, being left with a 12-inch scar.

Marczuk-Franczak later told police Kolodziejski had started hitting his partner after a few drinks and she had intervened.

She claimed that she had only picked up the knife to defend herself but admitted she had been 'waving it around'.

She said she later saw blood on the knife but does not know what happened to it. The knife was never recovered.

Mr Kolodziejski said in a statement that the attack had a 'significant impact' upon him. He said he struggles to zip up his clothing and shave. He also has problems sleeping and has become 'anxious and stressed, paranoid that someone may lunge at him', the court heard.

The court heard that Marczuk-Franczak has served at least three prison sentences for violence in Poland.

The court heard Marczuk-Franczak had served three prison sentences for violence in her native Poland

In 2002, she was convicted of theft and causing minor bodily injury and received a one-year prison sentence.

The following year she was convicted of causing minor bodily injury and received 18 months in prison and got a further 18 months in May 2004 for the same charge.

Marczuk-Franczak was jailed for two years this week after she was found guilty of wounding Mr Kolodziejski.

Passing sentence, Judge Andrew Woolman said: 'This incident arose out of a dispute initially between the victim and his girlfriend, he was violent towards his girlfriend.

'I accept that he was violent towards you and he subjected you to a significant attack which caused extensive bruising to your body. I have seen the photos and I sentence you on the basis that it was the victim who caused the injuries to you.

'But the jury's verdict means that you then picked up a kitchen knife and stabbed him in a downward motion to the neck quite deliberately.

'The knife went in some 10 cm down towards the chest cavity. Fortunately for him and for you the knife did not touch any vital organs.

'Nonetheless he is left with a serious wound partly caused by the knife and partly by the surgery and although he started the incident by attacking his girlfriend and you, it is clear that he is still, as a result of what you did to him, has significant problems both with his employment and his general life.'

The judge added: 'Despite what he has done, you caused that dreadful injury. You are 39 years of age, you have lived in the UK for not too long.

'It's clear that you have something of a turbulent life, you have convictions in Poland for violence - there are not a lot of details but enough so I am able to conclude that you are no stranger to violence in the past when provoked, perhaps.

'Your account in the trial was in affect, that the victim sustained his injuries by accident when you were waving the knife around - an account which the jury rejected. The injury you have caused is so serious that only an immediate custodial sentence can be justified.'

The Home Office investigates cases of EU citizens who commit crimes in Britain before deciding whether to bring deportation proceedings. Offenders who are given a sentence of  12 months or more are usually recommended for deportation.

UK border controls are dependent on other countries sharing information about their citizens' criminal pasts with them, a system which has led to many foreign criminals slipping into Britain, including Arnis Zalkalns, the Latvian killer believed to have murdered west London schoolgirl Alice Gross.
