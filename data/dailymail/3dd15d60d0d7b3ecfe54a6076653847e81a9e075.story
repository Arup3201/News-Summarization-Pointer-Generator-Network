Facing jail: Simon Kinney, 49, from Liverpool, gave a £50,000 stash of heroin to a grandmother who hid it among her Cornish pasties

A drug courier who was part of a £1million conspiracy is facing jail after he gave a stash of heroin to a grandmother who hid it among her Cornish pasties.

Simon Kinney admitted driving the £50,000 consignment from Liverpool before it was passed on to 75-year-old Michael and 63-year-old Teresa Wood, who drove it back to Bodmin, Cornwall.

Three generations of the Wood family have already been jailed for their part in the plot to bring heroin from the north-west to the West Country.

Kinney, 49, was arrested after being traced through his family by detectives and encouraged to give himself up.

Kinney admitted conspiracy to supply class A drugs and his sentence was adjourned until next month.

A pre-sentence report was ordered by Judge Francis Gilbert, QC, and he was remanded in custody.

The judge at Exeter Crown Court warned him: 'You must expect a custodial sentence.'

Kinney was part of a gang which brought an estimated £1million of heroin into Devon and Cornwall from Liverpool.

Three generations of the same Cornish family took part in the plot by which a stream of couriers brought drugs to Torbay and Bodmin.

Grandparents Michael and Teresa Wood helped two of their three sons and their grandson run the supply chain which was disrupted by a lengthy and sophisticated police surveillance operation.

It resulted in the couple being stopped as they drove from Torbay back to Bodmin with £50,000 worth of heroin in grandmother Wood's shopping bag alongside the Cornish pasties she had bought for their supper.

Kinney's role was as courier and he 
made two trips. The first was to Torbay, where his package of heroin was
passed to Michael and Teresa Wood before they were intercepted as they 
drove back to Bodmin.

At a 
hearing earlier this year Michael Wood, was jailed for six and a half 
years; his wife Teresa and grandson Jake, 24, were both jailed for four 
years.

The couple's two sons were also jailed. Ivan Wood, 43, was handed nine years behind bars and his 41-year-old brother Calvin six.

The main organiser in Torbay, Mark Gale, 41, from Torquay, was jailed for eight years and street dealer Richard Heywood, who sold drugs from various addresses for three years and eight months.

One of the gang leaders Craig Corrigan, 23, was jailed for nine years.

Couriers John Pogue, 27, Keith Anderson, 30, and Vincent Toohey, 29, all from Liverpool, were jailed for six, six and four and a half years respectively.

Money launderers Ryan Morgan, 29, and Brian McDonald, 48, also from Liverpool, were jailed for two years and 16 months respectively.

Key conspirator Stephen Blundell is on the run and will be sentenced later.

All the defendants admitted conspiracy to supply class A drugs with the exception of Teresa Wood and Mark Gale, who denied the charge and were convicted.
