After a big night out, man people will wake up with no recollection of the stupid things they have done.

But one drunk could not escape the prank he pulled, after he woke up to find his crime hopping around his room.

Merlin Quinnan stole a rabbit and a guinea pig after a boozy night out - only to realise what had happened when he woke up to find them scampering around his bedroom, a court heard.

Hapless Quinnan, 21, broke into a woman’s garden and took the startled animals from their hutches.

The next day, when he realised what had happened, he put pictures of them on Facebook and tried to sell the animals for £10.

Quinnan, of Redruth, Cornwall, admitted the theft as well as stealing a mountain bike and four offences of criminal damage to cars and a motorcycle.

He was sentenced to a 12-month community order with an alcoholic treatment scheme requirement for six months at Truro Magistrates Court.

He was also ordered to pay £210 compensation - including £10 to the owner of the rabbit.

The bizarre theft echoes a similar incident in February.

Anthony Campen, 29, kidnapped a chicken from a nearby primary school before dragging it to a houseparty where he posed with it before releasing it into the wild.

Police used the pictures to force Campen to admit his crime after he posted a number of photos on Facebook.

Pupils at the Bishops' Church of England and Roman Catholic Primary School in Chelmsford, Essex, had believed their pet chicken, called Olympia, had escapedbefore they began to suspect foul play.

Campen, from Chelmsford, Essex, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal sometime between January 26 and 28 this year 2012 when he appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates Court on February 20.
