A Philadelphia-based TV weatherman happily shared a picture of his newborn first child yesterday - as well as the man he is raising the boy with.

Adam Joseph, the meteorologist at 6ABC's Action News, and his partner of five years, known only as Karl, welcomed their son, Jacob, about 1.41am Tuesday.

The gorgeous baby weighed in at 9 pounds 1 ounce, measuring 21 inches long and the couple said they couldn't be happier.

However Joseph - who occasionally fills in on Good Morning America - admitted some hesitance to announcing the child had same-sex parents.

'This is unconditional love': Little Jacob weighed in at 9 pounds 1 ounce, measuring 21 inches long

On the job: Joseph is a popular meteorologist for 6ABC's Action News and occasionally appears on Good Morning America

'Was I hesitant? Maybe for one split second and then it passed,' he told MyPhilly.com.

'This is unconditional love and hope.

From the day he was born, I want him to understand that families come in all shapes, sizes and colors.

'I want my son to be proud of both his fathers.

'In our eyes, as long as there is unconditional love for a child, it doesn't matter who that child looks up to or leans on.

'I truly wish that every person wanting a family can feel this overwhelming happiness and joy.'

Joseph added that while he and Karl had discussed starting a family together for some time, there were some other factors forcing the decision.

'Combined, [Karl and I] have 14 nieces and nephews, and thought No. 15 was overdue since the youngest niece is 8,' he said.

Hesitance: Joseph said he was init6ially reluctant to admit to being part of a same-sex parent household, but that it quickly passed

'As for the timing, we both worked very hard to get to the place we are today.

'This is not an easy journey to go on, both emotionally and financially.

'Karl is the perfect partner and we've built an amazing foundation together to be able to start our family.

'We've had endless love and support from family and friends.'

'This has been a very long, emotional journey and today part of that journey ended while a new one has begun,' Joseph said.

'Tears instantly flowed when I first saw his face, even before he was placed in my arms. My dream of being a dad has become reality and so much more!'

Joseph has taken some time off from 6ABC following the bith of his son, who is believed to have been delivered via surrogate.
