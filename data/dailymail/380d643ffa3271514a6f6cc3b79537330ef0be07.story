He ordered an Uber cab for his 18-mile trip home after attending a Halloween party with friends.

But when Elliott Asbury went to pay, he wished he hadn't contacted the online taxi service at all.

Incredibly, he was told he owed a staggering $539.09 for the 25-minute journey from Jefferson County Government Center in Golden, Colorado, to his apartment near I-70 in Denver.

The enormous fare was due to Uber's dynamic pricing - also known as surge pricing - which is used on busy nights, such as Halloween, as a way to quell demand and attract more drivers.

Shocked: Elliott Asbury (pictured) was charged a staggering $539.09 for an 18-mile taxi ride from Jefferson County Government Center in Golden, Colorado, to his apartment near I-70 in Denver on October 31

A breakdwon of the price: The enormous fare was due to Uber's dynamic pricing - also known as surge pricing - which is used on busy nights, like Halloween, as a way to quell demand and attract more drivers

Despite being warned of the multiplied rates when he ordered the cab via smartphone last Friday - a rule that Uber applies to all customers - Mr Asbury described his total fare as 'outrageous'.

Speaking last Saturday, he told KDVR: 'Me and my bank account got taken for a ride last night. You just wouldn’t stand there and be like, ‘Hmm, is this  going to cost me half a grand to get home?’

'The thought just wouldn’t even cross your mind. I was expecting $44, $50, $60, $100 on the outside. We got there and he pressed the thing on his phone and it said $539 and nine cents.'

Mr Asbury said his fare - which was 7.4 times more what his normal rate would have been ($72.85) - even shocked the driver, who repeatedly apologized to him.

App: His high fare was also due to the fact he accidentally ordered a premium Black Car, instead of a cheaper UberX ride. He also failed to spot a button that would have estimated his fare in advance (pictured)

'(The driver) was shocked, he was embarrassed actually,' he said. 'He gave me his card and he was like, "Make phone calls. Get in touch with customer service. This can’t be right".'

The following day, Mr Asbury contacted the taxi firm's customer service line as suggested, but was told that his price was correct in accordance with the surge pricing.

In a statement, a spokesman for Uber - known for its cheap rates and fast service - said the firm's dynamic costs allowed it to remain 'the reliable choice, even on the busiest nights of the year'.

In Mr Asbury's case, his high fare was also due to his inexperience with the Uber smartphone application, which connects passengers with cab drivers and allows them to track their vehicle.

Another angry customer: It comes just a day after Gabrielle Wathen (pictured), from Baltimore, revealed she had racked up a $362 Uber cab bill after spending a night drinking with friends for her 26th birthday

He had accidentally ordered a premium Black Car, instead of a cheaper UberX ride, the news station reported.  He also failed to spot a button that would have estimated his fare in advance.

The spokesman said the taxi service offers a 25 per cent discount for first-time riders who are caught off-guard by the surge costs - something that will likely apply to Mr Asbury.

It comes just a day after a Baltimore woman revealed she had racked up a $362.57 Uber cab bill after spending a night drinking with friends for her 26th birthday.

Gabrielle Wathen, who was also traveling last Friday, Halloween, was charged nine times the standard rate for the entire 22-minute ride back to her apartment. 

Fundraising: After spending a 'good two hours' of her birthday crying over her $362.57 bill, Miss Wathen later managed to recoup her loss by crowd funding on GoFundMe. She ended up raising nearly $600

Within 12 hours, she raised nearly $600 from sympathetic donors - enough to cover the bill and pay for another big night out. The page has since been taken down.

At present, Uber is available in 45 countries and is worth more than $15billion.
