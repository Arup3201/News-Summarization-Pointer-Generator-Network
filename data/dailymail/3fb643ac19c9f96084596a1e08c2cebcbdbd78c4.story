The father of footballers Gary and Phil Neville has been charged with sexually assaulting a 46-year-old woman.

Neville Neville, 63, was told today he will face court over the alleged attack in March.

The football agent, from Bury, Lancashire, was arrested in the days after the alleged attack but released on bail.

Neville’s son, Gary, 38, a former 
Manchester United and England star, is now Sky Sports’ main football 
pundit.

Phil Neville, 36, used to play for 
England and has been at Everton since 2005. However, he is leaving this summer at the end of his contract. His twin sister Tracey was an England netball player.

Neville Senior played cricket for Greenmount Cricket Club in the Bolton Cricket League during the 1980s before becoming the high-profile director of Bury football club.

Neville inspired and mentored his two sons and acts as their agent, representing both during contract talks with their clubs.

He lives in a £650,000 mock-Tudor house he shares with his wife Jill, 61, in North Manor, Bury.

His unusual name achieved a cult status among football fans as ‘one of the best chants in football’. It is chanted on the football terraces to the tune of David Bowie’s hit Rebel Rebel.

A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service today confirmed he would face court proceedings.

The incident is alleged to have happened in the Greenmount area of Bury in the early hours of Saturday March 23.

Nazir Afzal, Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS North West, said: 'Greater Manchester Police has investigated an allegation of sexual assault by Neville Neville in March 2013.

'I have reviewed all the evidence that they have gathered and have authorised the police to charge him with one count of sexual assault by penetration against a 46-year-old woman.

'He has been bailed to appear at Bury and Rochdale Magistrates’ Court on 12 June 2013.

'This decision is made in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors. I have concluded that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that it is in the public interest to prosecute this case.

'With criminal proceedings now underway, I would like to stress the importance of nothing being placed in the public domain that could prejudice a future trial.

'For these reasons, we will not be commenting further about the case at this time.'

Simon McKay, Neville's solicitor-advocate, said: 'I confirm Mr Neville has been charged with sexual assault.

'In response to the CPS's swift and public statement, I wish to state clearly that he strenuously denies the allegation.

'I am instructed to test the propriety of the decision to charge and Mr Neville intends to defend the allegation vehemently. Please respect the family's privacy at this difficult time.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
