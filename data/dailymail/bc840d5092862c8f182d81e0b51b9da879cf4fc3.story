A father built a prosthetic hand for his 12-year-old son using a 3-D printer.

Paul McCarthy, from Marblehead Massachusetts, made the inexpensive yet functional prosthetic hand for his son Leon, who was born without fingers on one of his hands.

The family had been told when Leon was very young that he needed to get used to using his hand without prosthetics and try to acquire a full range of abilities and motion, but a doctor recently said they should start looking at prosthetic options.

Innovative: A father built a prosthetic hand for his 12-year-old son using a 3-D printer

Mr McCarthy began searching for a way to help his son whose hand did not grow due to the restricted blood flow in the womb.

He came across Robohand which had a video posted online with instructions on how to use a 3-D printer to make a prosthetic hand, reported CBS News.

The design relies on wrist movement - the downward motion creates cable tension which closes the fingers while a move upwards closes them.

Mr McCarthy borrowed a friend's 3-D printer, but it a month to figure out how to string, screw and bolt together what him and his son describe as the 'Frankenstein' version.

The youngster admitted at first he thought that the idea was 'crazy' but once it was assembled he said the hand was 'awesome.'

Leon's new hand gives him the ability to carry out tasks such as picking up a water bottle and a pencil.

'This thing costs us $5-$10, it was nothing,' said Mr McCarthy.Â 

He said a prosthesis would have cost the family in upwards of $30,000.

The cost allows the pair to experiment with different designs and change the prosthetic as Leon grows

Matthew Garibaldi, director of orthotics and prosthetics in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, says that making sure a prosthetic device fits is essential for it to work well, reports NPR.

He said because there are not many children with upper-extremity amputations there are limited options for pediatric prosthetics and that is why a device like Robohand is so appealing.

'Its primary function is to decrease manufacturing costs and increase productivity. The timeliness of this technology couldn't be better,' Mr Garibaldi said.
