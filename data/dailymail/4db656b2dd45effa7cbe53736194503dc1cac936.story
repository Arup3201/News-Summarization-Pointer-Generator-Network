Tens of thousands of rush hour train passenger were left stranded or facing major delays tonight when services on one of Britain’s busiest rail routes were 'massively' disrupted because of damaged power lines.

Rail bosses say they will be working through the night and beyond to fix the problem on the East Coast mainline linking London to Edinburgh as the great Christmas getaway begins.

And they urged those who could to camp out in the capital signalling that the delays are expected to last well into Tuesday with no guarantee they would be fully fixed by then.

Chaos: Rail commuters face massive delays and even being stranded in London because of huge problems with the East Coast Main Line

Wait: Services between King's Cross and Peterborough face severe delays and cancellations

Train operator East Coast cancelled all trains out of London King’s Cross and ran diversionary train and replacement bus services to the North after electric power lines near Hitchin were mysteriously damaged.

It said bluntly: ’No East Coast trains will run between London Kings Cross and Peterborough.’

It was unclear last night what had caused the damage with Network Rail 'ruling nothing out' and putting all its energy into solving the problem. It did not believe sabotage was to blame but could not give a conclusive reason.

National Rail said at least 14 'droppers' - part of the overhead wire - have been broken and contact wires damaged, causing further damage to passing trains.

The failure caused all services from the South – leaving London at a rate of up to four an hour - to be cancelled and forced services from the North to end at Peterborough subject to diversions or replacement buses.

The train company urged passengers who could spend the night in the capital – either in a hotel or with friends – to do so.

In the early hours of Tuesday morning, the East Coast Main Line Twitter feed stated: 'Repair work is being carried out overnight and it is hoped that a normal service will be running at that time.'

Restrictions on tickets were lifted to allow commuters to delay their trip or switch to other operators where possible as an emergency measure to try and help passengers get to their destinations – though this did lead to severe delays.

Three of the four lines around Hitchin were initially out of action from 2.45pm – causing rush hour chaos as commuters tried to get home.

A third line was re-opened at around 6.45pm but Network Rail stressed there would be ‘very limited services.’

Uncertainty: Travellers try to get information from rail staff as train services are crippled in one of the busiest periods of the year

Commuters could use alternate routes but this increased the burden on other train services, causing further delays

Commuter Will North works in advertising in London and was trying to get home to Grantham in Lincolnshire. He could not get a train until nearly 10pm.

He said: 'I got onto an earlier train and, after sitting there for a while was told it couldn't go because there was no train guard.

'I don't see how a downed power line has resulted in a shortage of guards. I would have done it if they asked.'

East Coast did put on some diesel trains to divert passengers where possible but as a spokesman said: 'No trains are leaving Kings Cross.'

Both network rail and East Coast described the problem as a being 'major' and 'massive'.

A Network Rail spokesman said: 'This is one of the busiest lines in Britain and one of the two main arteries between London and Scotland. So it is a massive problem.

Rail chiefs advised commuters to seek accommodation in London if possible, as the repair work is expected to continue throughout tonight and beyond

He continued: 'It will not be fixed quickly. We will be working through the night. Our priority is to get things moving again.'

As well as East Coast, other train companies affected by the electric power cable damage were First Capital Connect, Grand Central and First Hull Trains .

All routes through Stevenage were affected. The rail firm told passengers: 'Overhead wire problems are causing disruption between Stevenage and Hitchin.'

It noted: 'Journeys between London Kings Cross, Moorgate, Peterborough and Cambridge may be delayed by up to three hours.'

East Coast announced reduced services between Letchworth Garden City and Cambridge.

Between Stevenage and Hitchin and Letchworth Garden City passengers were urged to use buses.

Buses also ran between Stevenage and Luton Airport Parkway and also between Hatfield and St Albans (to connect with First Capital Connect Thameslink trains).

It added: 'First Hull Trains are only running between Doncaster and Hull.'

East
Coast passengers were told their tickets would be accepted by 
CrossCountry trains ‘on reasonable routes’, on East Midlands Trains 
services between London St Pancras International and Sheffield / Leeds 
and also between Peterborough, Grantham and Nottingham.

Motorists seeking to get away on the 
roads this week still face 98 miles of roadworks – despite efforts to 
finish or lift the bulk of them.

Lane
restrictions or temporary speed limits will need to remain in place at 
19 locations for the safety of drivers and their passengers, said the 
Highways Agency.

These
include on the M3 near Camberley,  the M4 near Reading, the M25 near 
Godstone and various sections of the M62 near Doncaster.

The
Highways Agency said it will be clearing more than nine out of ten 
roadworks for the holiday period, with plans in place to complete more 
than 250 miles of roadworks on England’s motorways and major A roads by 
the end of this week. A further 57 miles will be suspended between 
December 21 and January 2 2013.

They would also be taken on First TransPennine Express trains between Manchester Piccadilly and York and also between Sheffield and Doncaster, as well as Virgin Trains services between London Euston and Scotland and also between London Euston and Manchester.

East Coast added: ‘Passengers who decide not to travel today may use their tickets tomorrow (Tuesday).’

The website added: 'First Capital Connect passengers may use Greater Anglia trains to and from Cambridge, London Underground services on reasonable routes and Uno buses on reasonable routes.

‘First Hull Trains passengers may use East Midlands Trains, First TransPennine Express, Northern Rail and Virgin Trains services on reasonable routes.

'Passengers should travel tomorrow instead if possible.’

And it added: ’Grand Central passengers may use CrossCountry, East Coast, Greater Anglia and London Underground services on reasonable routes and East Midlands Trains services between London and Sheffield / Leeds. Passengers who decide not to travel today, may travel tomorrow (Tuesday) instead.’
