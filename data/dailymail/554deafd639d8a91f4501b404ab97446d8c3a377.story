Interflora has been forced to remove British labelling from bouquets after it emerged many of its flowers come from abroad.

The firm had said that half of the blooms in its £195 Valentine’s day gift were UK-grown – a claim that checks showed to be false.

Experts found that the red chrysanthemums in the bouquet are not even available in Britain at this time of year.

'British grown': Interflora's claims about having flowers grown in the UK were proven to be false. Here is where they really come from

When a dozen independent Interflora florists nationwide were called at random, half admitted that all their flowers came from Holland and some came from as far as Colombia.

Red tulips and ivy were the only British-grown of the ten varieties of flower in the bouquet – and only a quarter of the florists had either in stock.

Industry experts say that British-grown red chrysanthemums are not available anywhere in the UK at this time of year and it is highly unlikely anywhere will be growing white hyacinths or myrtle commercially either.

Embarrassingly, Interflora have now caved in to demands that it ditch its controversial ‘British grown’ icons and have admitted that it ‘cannot guarantee’ the source of its flowers.

Even one of the country’s biggest wholesalers which specialises in British-grown flowers, Pratley of London’s New Covent Garden Market, had only the red tulips from this country.

Interflora accepts that the remaining five flowers in its bouquets - red and pink roses, lilac, agapanthus and amaranth - are all imported.

'Out of our control': Interflora said they cannot guarantee where each store gets their flowers from

Grower Gill Hodgson, a campaigner for the British flower industry, estimates that the bouquet’s flowers have covered up to 188,447 air miles.

She said: ‘Interflora’s florists are having a difficult time making ends meet.

‘If it is left to them whether to buy cheap imported flowers or more expensive British flowers, naturally they will buy the cheaper ones.

‘Interflora has really shot themselves in the foot by claiming their flowers are British-grown.

‘The few chrysanthemum growers left in Britain do not use heat and you need that to grow them at this time of year.

‘We say it is not very likely the flowers in their bouquets will be British-grown and the fact they have retracted their icons means they cannot justify their claims.

She added: ‘The RHS are the main British gardening organisation and they should be promoting British growers and not endorsing a product that is predominantly imported.

‘Right now, British growers have superb tulips grown in Lincolnshire, stunning anemones and gloriously scented narcissi from Cornwall and the Scillies.

‘To see the RHS then championing scentless flowers mass-produced in South America is soul-destroying.’

Louise Curley, author of The Cut Flower Patch, said: ‘It’s disappointing the RHS didn’t take the opportunity to promote British flowers.

‘Just as we’ve done with food, we need to be looking at sourcing locally-grown flowers and growing our own.

‘Apart from the environmental cost, imported blooms mean we have lost touch with the seasons.’

According to the RHS and Interflora, the bouquet’s flowers “encapsulate the meaning of love in all its forms’.

Interflora’s expert florist David Ragg, who created the bouquet, said: ‘Whether it’s the deep velvety reds of the Grand Prix roses or the sweet smelling lilac, all the elements come together to portray a symphony of affection.’ 

An Interflora spokeswoman said yesterday: ‘We have got 1,800 independent florists and they all source their own stock.

‘There is a certain percentage of the stems that can be sourced as British-grown but it is out of our control where each individual florist gets their stems from.

‘We cannot guarantee that every one of those florists is going to source British-grown stems.

‘To avoid being misleading in any way, we decided we would take the ‘British-grown’ icons off.’

A percentage of all proceeds from Interflora’s bouquets is going towards RHS charitable activities.

An RHS spokesman said that is ‘extremely committed to supporting British horticulture.’
