A man was allegedly slashed across the face with a scythe during a ‘shocking’ brawl between rivalling gipsy families outside a plush four-star hotel in a ‘peaceful and tranquil area’.

A group of travellers had been drinking inside the Hilton Treetops Hotel in Aberdeen, Scotland, when the bitter row broke out on Saturday.

One of the men was allegedly slashed with a scythe after the argument spilled outside into the car park of the hotel.

The 34-year-old was taken to hospital with a suspected broken collar bone and multiple other injuries following the brawl.

One witness, who did not want to be named, said terrified hotel staff had to call in the police to break up the fight.

The local resident said the victim was attacked with what appeared to be a garden scythe.

Police confirmed officers were called to an assault at around 6.45pm on Saturday at the hotel in the city's Springfield Road.

A Police Scotland spokesman said: ‘On Saturday evening we were called to reports of a disturbance on the street.

The 34-year-old man was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for treatment following the incident.

Hotel staff had to call the police in order to split the opposing parties up as other guests watched the scuffle unfold in shock.

A spokesman for the hotel said: ‘We can confirm police were called by Hilton Aberdeen Treetops following an incident in the hotel car park involving individuals who had visited the bar.

‘On becoming aware of the situation, hotel team members acted swiftly and the matter was dealt with by the authorities, with whom we continue to liaise.’

Councillor Martin Greig said the Hilton Treetops is in a quiet area of town and said it was shocking that such an incident had taken place.

He said: ‘This is a peaceful and tranquil area and to hear of such a shocking crime it is extremely upsetting.

‘The hotel is much respected business.

‘This is mainly a residential area and the community enjoys relatively low levels of crime.’

Aberdeen City Council has had a number of problems with illegal travellers’ camps and is looking to set up a by-law to combat the problem.
