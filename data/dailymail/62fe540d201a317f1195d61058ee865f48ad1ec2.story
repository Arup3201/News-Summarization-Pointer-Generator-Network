Police and border force officers were forced to meet a flight into Britain last night after a snake was smuggled on board inside a takeaway box.

Passengers expressed their shock as the serpent was discovered on the easyJet service from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Luton Airport yesterday evening.

MailOnline understands the authorities were called while the plane was in mid-air and waited at the gate for the jet to land around three hours later.

EasyJet says the people on board were not in danger but has complained to the Israeli airport because they failed to spot the snake during security checks.

Reaction: These passengers tweeted from the plane as the drama unfolded last night - comparing it to a famous Hollywood movie

The majority of passengers saw the funny side, comparing it the famous Hollywood movie 'Snakes on a Plane', which starred Samuel L Jackson.

This 2006 thriller's plot centres around a gangster's plan to crash an aircraft before it arrives in Los Angeles by planting a crate of venomous snakes on board to kill the passengers and crew.

Last night's incident was not as serious, as the reptile found was a non-poisonous corn snake hidden inside a meal box.

It is understood that border staff dealt with the incident and allowed the passenger to leave the airport with the pet.

Passenger Rafi Addleston, tweeted: 'No Samuel L (Jackson), but an actual snake on a plane. 
Police about to meet @easyJet arriving from Tel Aviv to Luton.'

Another, Michael Harris wrote: 'Just landed at @LDNLutonAirport with @easyJet...
Police about to board to arrest guy who bought on a snake on the 
plane!'

Danielle Stone said: 'Snake on the plane - not your classic Tel Aviv to Luton flight!'

Easyjet said today that the snake was found in a 'small takeaway box'.

'We can confirm that a passenger brought a small, pet snake in a container onboard a flight from Tel Aviv to Luton,' a spokesman said today.

'As soon as crew became aware of this they dealt with the issue, immediately contacting the authorities to ensure they met the aircraft at Luton.  The safety of passengers is always our highest priority. 

Action: Police and border force officers were waiting three hours for the plane to land and eventually let the passenger leave with the snake

'The harmless snake remained in its 
container at all times and passengers were not in any danger. We have 
raised the issue with the airport to understand why the reptile was not 
detected during security.'

Corn snakes, which are native to North America, can grow up to 6ft long and prey on rodents, killing them by constriction.

Their reluctance to bite makes them popular pets, and in captivity they can live to be up to 23 years old.
