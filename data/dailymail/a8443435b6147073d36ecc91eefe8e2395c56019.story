Police have arrested a man who allegedly had a replica firearm at Martin Place in Sydney on Sunday

A replica firearm was then apparently discovered inside a plastic bag, and the man was taken into custody.

The man was found just a few hundred metres from the Lindt Cafe, where a crazed gunman held more than a dozen hostages over 16 hours last December.

The Cafe reopened last week, fitted with two plaques commemorate the lives of Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson who were tragically killed.
