As rider requests go, Mariah Carey's rumoured demand to have yellow sweets removed from her M&M bowl is one of the most bizarre.

But the singer's entourage can now rest easy with the creation of an iPhone-powered machine that rapidly sorts M&Ms into different colours.

The DIY designs claims to be faster that most sorters, which work by registering a sweets' colour using a sensor before dropping them into rotating containers.

A London-based blogger has created an iPhone-powered machine that sorts M&Ms into different colours. 

The new machine, created by London-based blogger ‘reviewmylife’, improves on this design by replacing the sensor with an iPhone 5s camera.

Once the camera registers the M&M’s colour, a Bluetooth module attached to an Arduino-powered motor fires off the correct electromagnet gate to do the physical sorting.

‘I don't stop the M&M for colour recognition. Instead I use an iPhone to capture the colour of the M&M as it is in freefall,’ the anonymous blogger wrote on his site.

‘As it is still falling the iPhone talks to a Bluetooth module attached to an Arduino and that fires off the correct electro magnet controlled gate.’

The M&M sorted uses an iPhone 5s camera to capture the colour of the M&M as it is in freefall. 

As it is still falling the iPhone talks to a Bluetooth module attached to an Arduino-powered motor.

That fires off the correct electromagnet-controlled gate, which sends the M&M into the correct pot. 

'Even though this is just a rough prototype it is reasonably fast because the colour recognition and path that the M&M takes down the chute is decided and determined whilst the M&M is moving under gravity,' said London-based blogger, reviewmylife. 

Reviewmylife added that his prototype is fast because the colour recognition and path that the M&M takes down the chute is decided while the M&M is moving under gravity.

The blogger said that he'd now like to get the parts for the machine 3D printed.

'I also want to try to change the M&M sorting gates so instead of being in a line they are arranged in a circle - like a flower,' he told MailOnline.

'This would allow the height of the machine to be reduced, and also mean that the time between the M&M starting to fall and the gate firing would be constant. This should make it easier to increase the speed.'  

There is, however, a drawback for bands such as Van Halen who  reportedly requested a rider for M&Ms with the brown ones remove.

The blogger claims that the chocolate's natural colour is hard to distinguish from orange and shadow.

The invention could impress the likes of Mariah Carey, who  is rumoured to have asked for all yellow sweets removed from her M&M bowl is a rider request
