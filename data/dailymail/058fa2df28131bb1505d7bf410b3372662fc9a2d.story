The son of Pele has been sentenced to 33 years behind bars for laundering drug money.

Edinho – who played for Santos two decades ago - was found to have raised the cash from drug trafficking, reports the BBC.

The news represents a huge PR disaster for Brazil with under a fortnight to go until the World Cup starts.

Embarrassment: The news represents a PR disaster for Brazil ahead of the World Cup starting this month

Pele’s son admits to being a drug addict but protests his innocence surrounding any other charges.

The 43-year-old – who has served time in jail for drug trafficking before – is a goalkeeping coach at Santos.

He is expected to appeal the ruling according to Brazilian media.

Pele labelled his country a 'disgrace' last month for their poor planning ahead of the biggest show on earth.

There have been a number of delays to the completion of some stadiums as well as widespread theft and corruption in the build-up to the tournament.

'There has been significant time to get the stadiums finished. The situation is unacceptable – it is a disgrace. The political situation is difficult,' he said.

‘Our team has nothing to do with the ongoing corruption that has delayed construction of the stadiums.

‘It is not the problem of the players but the situation worries me a great deal. The evil people who have stolen all the money are to blame. Protests against corruption are understandable – but not the use of the force.’
