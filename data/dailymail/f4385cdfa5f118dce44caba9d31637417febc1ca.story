David Cameron is delaying a controversial appointment by Speaker John Bercow over fears it could ‘embarrass the Queen’.

Government sources said the Prime Minister was effectively sitting on Mr Bercow’s decision to appoint Australian catering manager Carol Mills to the £200,000-a-year post of Clerk of the Commons, in charge of running Parliament. 

Mr Bercow’s selection has been criticised by MPs on all sides, warning that Miss Mills lacks the knowledge to advise Parliament on constitutional matters.

No 10 yesterday confirmed the Prime Minister had not forwarded the nomination to the Queen for approval, despite having had it for at least ten days. 

A spokesman said: ‘It is an important role and for the individual to be able to carry it out successfully, they need support from MPs across the Commons.’ 

The comments come after senior MPs raised concerns over Ms Mills's lack of knowledge about Westminster procedures.

The prestigious £200,000-a-year post combines the clerk's duties as a key constitutional adviser with the role of Commons chief executive.

In an effort to defuse the row, Mr Bercow has indicated he wants to split the functions into two jobs as soon as possible.

The suggestion has failed to appease critics who are planning a potentially damaging showdown with the Speaker when the Commons returns from its summer break next week.

There have been calls for a confirmation hearing before a committee, and a motion could be tabled in the House to force the issue.

Ms Mills, currently head of the Department of Parliamentary Services in Canberra, was recommended for the role earlier this month following an open recruitment process with a selection panel led by Mr Bercow.

He is believed to be keen to bring in an outsider to press ahead with modernisation of the House, rather than promoting deputy clerk David Natzler.

The Prime Minister is responsible for passing the recommendation to the Queen to be finalised.

The text of a motion that could potentially be tabled by Tory backbencher Jesse Norman next week has been circulated. Reports suggest up to 50 MPs have already pledged to support it.

It would apparently stop short of demanding Ms Mills appointment be abandoned, merely insisting there should be a confirmation hearing.

The mooted text reads: ‘That this House believes that the recommendation of Ms Carol Mills to be Clerk of this House should be subject to, and contingent upon, a pre-appointment hearing and report by a select committee.’

Mr Bercow has been under mounting pressure to delay the appointment.

Former foreign secretaries Jack Straw and Margaret Beckett last week added their voices to a cross-party campaign to let MPs grill Mr Bercow’s top choice to become the next House of Commons clerk.

It came after Ms Mills finally broke her silence over the controversy surrounding her proposed appointment.

Ms Mills, a senior aide in the Australian Parliament in Canberra, said she was ‘disappointed’ that colleagues in Australia had declared that she had ‘no parliamentary knowledge or experience’.

It came after an email was leaked from the Australian clerk of the Senate, Rosemary Laing, to the Commons authorities which warned against her appointment.

Responding to the memo Ms Mills said: ‘It would not be appropriate for me to comment further in a personal capacity at this time,’ she said.

‘As a senior parliamentary officer, I take seriously my responsibilities to promote and uphold the values and code of conduct articulated in the Commonwealth of Australia Parliamentary Service Act 1999.’

Ms Laing apparently cited an incident in which CCTV cameras were used in the Australian Parliament to track someone pushing an envelope under the door of a senator's office late at night.

The episode is being investigated, as cameras are supposed to be used only for security and to prosecute illegal activity.

But Ms Mills said her Department of Parliamentary Services ‘looks forward to the opportunity to explain to the committee the basis of its view that use of the CCTV footage was in fact authorised, and wholly consistent with parliamentary privilege’.
