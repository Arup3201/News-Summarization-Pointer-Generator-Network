Philadelphia sports fans have become infamous for their bad behavior, but it looks like it may have paid off for once.

After much public outrage from Philadelphia Flyers fans when their beloved Ice Girls cleaning crew were replaced by a group of men cleaning the rink between periods during home games earlier this year, the team has decided to bring back the ladies once regular season play begins.

Anything to calm those Philly fanatics.

Coming back: After being absent so far this season, the Philadelphia Flyers announced last night the Ice Girls cleaning crew (above) would return when the regular season begins

Fan unfavorites: Many were upset when they learned the Ice Girls had been replaced with an all-male cleaning squad (above) earlier this year

The announcement was made during last night's game on the jumbotron. 

There was also a video of the girls that accompanied the big announcement, which led to much cheering from the crowd according to Deadspin. 

Fans learned the Ice Girls were no longer when the Flyers took on the Toronto Maple Leafs at the Wells Fargo Center in their first pre-season game of the year, and a group of men, and not women, hit the ice to do some cleaning.

The boos and jeers inside the stadium were deafening as these gentlemen, who, unlike their predecessors, got to wear pants and a fleece, went to work on the ice.

Temporary leave: It is uncertain why the girls were not back for pre-season games earlier this year

There is still no word yet on just why the Ice Girls were replaced, but one of the group's members, Erika Choi Smith, did break the news on her Twitter this August that they would not return to the rink. 

'No #FlyersIceGirls this year, but just wanted to say thanks to one of our biggest fans @FlyersNation & to all #Flyers Fans for being AWESOME,' she wrote.

The girls will now be back though, taking to the ice every game wearing nothing but a midriff-baring top, hot pants, leg warmers and their skates, not the best outfit for a place where the temperature is around 50 degrees.

The Philadelphia Flyers also play an outdoor classic every year, where the temperature is about 20 degrees. 

Strict rules: The girls are asked to never fraternize with any of the hockey players and can't eat while in costume

Mother Jones  wrote an article about the Ice Girls last year, and the all-female cleaning crew for another hockey team, the Los Angeles Kings, highlighting how little the girls were paid and the many strict rules they had to adhere too.

Among other things, the girls were not allowed to eat in public while wearing their costume and could not fraternize with any of the athletes, being told they should leave a bar or restaurant if they were out and one of the players came in.

This negative coverage could be why the Ice Girls were temporarily replaced by the new all-male cleaning crew.
