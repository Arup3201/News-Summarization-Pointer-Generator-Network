A high school student claims she has been fined $1,000 and had her diploma withheld for wearing an eagle feather in her graduation cap as a symbol of her Native American heritage.

Chelsey Ramer, 17, from Alabama, is a member of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, and wanted to wear the feather to show her pride in her culture.

However, she says Escambia Academy High School forbade her from wearing the feather and then refused to give her the diploma when she broke the rules.

Chelsey Ramer, 17, was fined $1,000 after wearing an eagle feather in her cap (left) during the ceremony

She said the eagle feather is an important symbol of the heritage and spirituality of the Poarch Creek Indians

Now, the teenager says she has been told she cannot pick up the certificate until she pays the fine imposed by the private school. 

Miss Ramer told the Indian Country Today Media Network that she was 'excited' about the ceremony on May 23 but has been left dismayed by her school's reaction.

She was warned she would be pulled out of the ceremony if she wore the feather but instead was refused her diploma afterwards.

She said: 'I feel like this wasn’t fair. It felt like it wasn’t legal.

'It really did hurt my feelings. I have watched others wear it and I looked forward to it my whole four years there. Now when it was my turn, [they said] I couldn’t.'

The teenager believes the refusal is 'discrimination'.

She said repeated requests from herself and her tribal teacher, as well as other Indian seniors, were turned down.

Tribal teacher Alex Alvarez told the network that the eagle feather is an important sign of their heritage and spirituality and the refusal was 'ridiculous'.

The teacher said requests before the ceremony to speak to school administrators were turned down.

Mr Alvarez said: 'We don’t have much left as Indian people, to give a child an eagle feather as an achievement should be adhered to.'

Miss
Ramer said she approached the school's then head teacher Betty Warren 
about wearing the feather but was refused permission.

The teenager said she, like all other 
graduates, were told they must sign a school contract that states no 
'extraneous items' should be worn during the ceremony without prior 
permission.

She said she refused to sign and wore the feather anyway with the full support of her family.

A friend tied it to the tassel on her cap.

According to local newspaper the Atmore Advance, Miss Ramer intends to pay the fine and believes the money is worth paying to display her pride.

She said: 'It was worth every penny of the thousand dollars. This is what I’ve been waiting on, and I feel like I have a right to wear it.'

The newspaper said head teacher Warren resigned after the incident and was replaced.

The school has not commented on Miss Ramer's claims.

A Creek Indian village. The Poarch Band are descended from the tribe

The Poarch Band of Creek Indians is the only federally recognised tribe of Native Americans in Alabama.

They are descended from a segment of the original Creek Nation, which once covered all of Alabama and Georgia, and operate as a sovereign nation.

Poarch Indians have their own legislative, executive and judicial branches in Alabama and operate three gaming casinos and a hotel.

They have lived as a distinct community in the state for past 200 years and unlike many tribes were not removed from their tribal lands. 

Creek Nation was defeated in the battle at Horseshoe Bend after the tribes fought settlers when they began taking over Indian land.

The Creeks were illegally forced to cede their territory to the United States and most were forcibly removed from their land.

The Poarch Creek Indian Reservation is located in southern Alabama near the city of Atmore, Alabama.

As of December 31, 2011, there are 3,095 members of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, of which over 1,000 live in the vicinity of Poarch, Alabama.

The current chairman of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians is Buford L. Rolin.
