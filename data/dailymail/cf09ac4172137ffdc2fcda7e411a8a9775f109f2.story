A new Gallup poll shows that the majority of Americans don't want President Barack Obama calling all the shots anymore. 

Americans say by a large margin that they'd rather Obama back off and let Republicans take the lead in the new Congress than the other way around.

The poll supports Republican claims that last week's midterm elections were in fact a referendum on the president - an assessment the White House has forcibly denied both before and after the president's party was walloped at the ballot box.

Even before last week's midterm elections the White House had been spinning expected Democratic loses as mostly unrelated to Obama, saying individual candidates, not the nation's leader, were on the ballot this year.  

After his party's candidates were demolished in the off-year elections and exit polls showed that a third of voters came out to send the president a message of opposition - compared to just 19 percent who said they were voting that day to support Obama - the president still vowed to forge ahead with his agenda, regardless of anyone else's opinion on the matter.

'My job over the next couple of years is to do some practical, concrete things as much as possible with Congress,' Obama said during a post-election press conference last Wednesday.

'Where it’s not possible with Congress,' he said, I'll do it 'on my own, to show people why we should be confident and to give people a sense of progress and a sense of hope.'

But just 36 percent of respondents to Gallup's latest survey said they wanted Obama to set the agenda moving forward. More than half, 53 percent, said they thought Republicans' plans should be given more weight than the presidents.

The poll, taken after the election from Nov. 6-9, indicates that voters did indeed mean the midterm elections to be a realignment of leadership and priorities.

If warnings in the weeks before midterms as well as the elections themselves weren't enough to convince the White House to change tack, it's unlikely that a new polling will change the president's calculus, either, however.

At his presser last week President Obama indicated that he would make no policy shifts nor would he significantly change his approach to working with Republicans on Capitol Hill despite the previous evening's loses.

Obama said he's always tried to seek out compromise with Republicans whenever he can, and he intends to keep doing that. 

Pressed to name a change he would make 'to address the concerns that voters expressed' with him and his administration, Obama said that as the 'guy who’s elected by everybody' and not just voters from a certain state or congressional district, Americans 'want me to push hard to close some of these divisions, break through some of the gridlock, and get stuff done.

'So, the most important thing I can do is just get stuff done and help Congress get some things done,' he said, suggesting that he would work harder to force Republicans' hands than he did before his party was publicly reprimanded by voters.

Americans clearly want Obama to follow Republicans' lead and not the other way around, a Gallup poll released this afternoon shows

He also committed to going around newly elected Republican officials to make changes to the country's immigration rules, arguing that he's already given GOP lawmakers who are currently serving in federal office an opportunity to stop him by passing comprehensive immigration reform legislation. Now it's his turn at the wheel, he said.

'I think it’s fair to say that I have shown a lot of patience and have tried to work on a bipartisan basis as much as possible,' he contended. 'And I’m going to keep on doing so. But in the meantime, let’s figure out what we can do lawfully though executive actions to improve the functioning of the existing system.'

Days later, President Obama was still refusing to give an inch to Republicans when he sat down with CBS News anchor Bob Schieffer for a special edition of its hit Sunday morning program Face the Nation.

Again asked what he plans to do differently in light of the recent election results, Obama said he told his team it needs to do a better job convincing Republicans to get on board with the White House's plans.

'We've got to sell it, we've got to reach out to the other side and where possible persuade,' he said. 

'And I think there are times, there's no doubt about it where, you know, I think we have not been successful in going out there and letting people know what it is that we are trying to do and why this is the right direction,' he said, chalking up Democratic loses to 'a failure of politics.' 

The only valid criticism of his administration that Obama was willing to admit to Schieffer was giving up too quickly on fighting a 'pretty stubborn' opposition.

Likewise, at a briefing on Thursday with reporters White House flak Josh Earnest blamed election loses on Republican obstructionism. 

'They may be able to say with some credibility that they did benefit politically from obstructing the President’s agenda at every turn. I don't think the country benefited from that, though,' Earnest told reporters. 'And I don't just say that because Republicans are now in the majority. 

'I just think that there was a lot of very important things that didn't get done that could have, had the President found more willing partners among Republicans,' he opined.

Earnest said he doesn't expect Republicans to completely reecalibrate once they officially take over Congress in January, but he does hope they will be more open to Democratic-backed legislation.

'Again, it doesn’t mean that there are going to be daily renditions of Kumbaya sung on Pennsylvania Avenue, but I do think that we can be at least a little more optimistic that where common ground exists, that Democrats and Republicans can move together on it,' he said.

If voters expected Obama to step aside during the final two years of his presidency and let the GOP-led Congress chart the nation a new course, they would appear to be woefully mistaken based on Obama's behavior in the last week.

Obama told reporters last Wednesday that he planned 'to squeeze every last little bit of opportunity' out of his presidency to shape the nation. 

'The one thing I’m pretty confident about...is, I’m going to be busy for the next two years,' he noted.

'And the one thing that I want the American people to be confident about is that every day, I’m going to be filling up my time trying to figure out how I can make their lives better. 

'And if I’m doing that, at the end of my presidency, I’ll say, “We played that fourth quarter well, and we played the game well.” And the only difference between, I guess, basketball and ... politics is that the only score that matters is how’d somebody else do, not how you did. And that’s the score I’m keeping.'
