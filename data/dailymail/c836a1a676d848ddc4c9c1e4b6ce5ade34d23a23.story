Michael Higdon came off the bench and scored two late goals to send Nigel Clough’s Sheffield United into the quarter-finals.

Striker Higdon, 31, headed his first on 86 minutes from Jose Baxter’s cross and added his second four minutes later with a shot into the bottom left-hand corner to snatch a dramatic victory.

MK Dons’ two brightest young prospects, both of interest to Premier League clubs, had combined to put their side ahead.

Man of the match: Delle Alli.

Referee: Roger East 6.

Delle Alli, the 18-year-old starlet with a wealth of admirers in high places, enticed a foul in the box with an electric run before Benfik Afobe, 21, an on-loan Arsenal striker confidently netted from the spot for his sixth Capital One Cup goal of the season.

Alli lit up the second round as MK Dons dispatched Manchester United 4-0. This fourth-round tie had little of the magic of that occasion but Alli again showed why he is being courted by the likes of Liverpool and Arsenal.

MK Dons breakthrough came in the 66th minute when Alli was brought down by Craig Alcock and Afobe coolly slotted home. It was a rare moment of quality until the dramatic late finish.

If one action summed up a lacklustre first half it was United defender Robert Harris’s free kick from 25 yards out in the 40th minute which he lamely lifted high and wide.

MK Dons started brightly, with Afobe coming close to connecting with a looping ball into the box from Tom Flanagan in the second minute. Afobe admitted wanting to impress Arsene Wenger, ahead of his contract running out at the end of this season.

Holding midfielder Alli looks a classy prospect and linked up well with Afobe. Alli sparkled in the second half, skipping away from challenges and creating space for his teammates.

But it was the United who dominated the opening stages of the second half. Clough shook his head in disbelief as his side failed to score in the second minute after the break when a group of players in the box lunged for the ball but missed the chance to score. Clough again had head in hands when Stefan Scougall headed over by he was dancing with joy at the final whistle thanks to Higdon’s heroics.

There was plenty of grabbing and grappling in the box in the second minute of the second half when several Sheffield United players were held by MK Dons defenders. This went unpunished by referee Roger East. East was more inclined to reach for his book when Dele Alli was floored by a sliding tackle by Craig Alcock.
