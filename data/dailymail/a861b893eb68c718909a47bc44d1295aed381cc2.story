An Iraq war hero whose bravery earned him one of Britain’s highest military decorations is selling his medal collection because he is too ill to work.

Colour Sergeant James Harkess, 46, hopes his medals – including the rare Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for ‘exceptional bravery’ – will sell for £120,000.

He received the CGC after putting himself in the line of fire to lead his men through three firefights in just two months.

Colour Sergeant James Harkess is to sell his Conspicuous Gallantry Cross, awarded for his bravery after he put his life at risk three times to save his men but ill health has meant he is now unable to work 

In one, he and his Warrior armoured vehicle crew were lucky to survive a six-hour battle on June 11, 2006, fighting off 200 Mahdi Army soldiers in Al Amarah. The four-man team was attacked with rocket-propelled grenades, machine guns, sniper fire and blast bombs.

Sergeant Harkess, who spent much of the battle exposed from the turret, said: ‘It was constant. There was no let-up, and I was firing all through. My crew took down 50 enemy in total easily. They were coming at us in waves – you could see bodies stacked up where we’d been killing them.

‘Guys would jump on rooftops five metres away and start firing. You’d put them down, then more would be there a minute later.’

The platoon sergeant with the Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment, who left the Army last year after 22 years, said: ‘I loved the Army. I miss it but when it’s your time to leave, you have to go. I have all the memories I require.’

Speaking of his medals, he added: ‘They should raise a substantial amount. I suffer from ill-health which has meant I have not been able to work.

‘Because of this I am dependent on my Army pension so the sale will help me financially.’

Sergeant Harkess, from Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, was also awarded his Conspicuous Gallantry Cross – just one down from the Victoria Cross – for two other battles. On May 23 2006, he rescued his platoon after securing a route to safety having been cut off by 50 militiamen.

Then, on July 30 that year, he fearlessly led his crew towards the enemy after an ambush on a night supply convoy. 

With his men pinned down, he personally found the three snipers who had them cornered and killed two.

Pierce Noonan, of London auctioneer Dix Noonan Webb, which is selling the medals on February 25, said: ‘James Harkess showed astonishing bravery and leadership during some of the most ferocious street fighting since the Second World War. Such men are a very special breed.’

The Conspicuous Gallantry Cross (CGC) is the second highest military medal that can be awarded to members of the United Kingdom's armed forces.

Presented in 'recognition of an act or acts of conspicuous gallantry during active operations against the enemy', the medal was introduced in 1993 and is second only to the Victoria Cross.

It was introduced after a review of the honours system as part of a drive to remove distinctions of rank in awards for bravery, replacing both the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal, and can also be awarded posthumously. 

All ranks of the Royal Navy, British Army, and Royal Air Force can be awarded the CGC, with further medal-worthy acts of gallantry honoured with a bar which can be added to the medal.

The CGC is silver and in the shape of a cross, with a laurel wreath underneath and is mounted on a white ribbon with blue and crimson stripes. A recipient's rank, name and unit are engraved on the reverse. 

Corporal Wayne Mills was the first gazetted recipient of the CGC. While serving with the 1st Battalion The Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding) on UN Service in Bosnia in 1994, his patrol came under  fire, from a group of Bosnian Serbs. The patrol returned fire, killing two of the attackers but became vulnerable to futher attack when they reached an open clearing. Corporal Mills then  turned back into the wood and engaged the attacking group, delaying them long enough to allow the rest of his patrol to cross the clearing. Corporal Mills shot the leader of the group, causing the rest to scatter and returned to his patrol safely.
