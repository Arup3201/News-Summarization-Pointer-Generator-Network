Victorious: Lulu singing in the Eurovision contest 1969. She won with song Bomm Bang-a-Bang

He has already been told that an independent Scotland may not be able to stay in the EU or keep the pound.

But now Alex Salmond faces perhaps the biggest threat his dream of Scottish statehood.

For the country’s first minister has now been warned that, if it opts for secession, Scotland might not be allowed to enter the Eurovision Song Contest.

When the Scottish National Party leader unveiled a 670-page ‘blueprint’ setting out the case for independence ahead of next September’s landmark referendum he recommended replacing the BBC with SBS - Scottish Broadcasting Service - using the assets of BBC Scotland.

SBS would broadcast Strictly Come Dancing, Doctor Who and CBeebies in return for giving the BBC access to its existing resources north of the border.

A spokesman for the annual festival said an independent Scotland would have to reapply for membership of the European Broadcasting Union, which organises the contest – and accession would not be ‘automatic’.

It means that it 2016, the year Mr Salmond wants to see Scotland re-gain its independence, the country may have to sit on the sidelines while the rest of the UK fights it out.

Scottish singer Lulu previously won the contest for the UK in 1969, with Boom Bang A Bang; while Scott Fitzgerald came second to Celine Dion in 1988. However, when the UK entered with kilt-wearing Kenneth McKellar in 1966, he only received votes from two countries.

The blow over Eurovision comes just days after Chancellor George Osborne said the country would not be able to share the pound with the rest of the UK if it leaves the country.

And European Commission president Joe Manuel Barroso warned it would be ‘difficult’ for a post-independence Scotland to re-enter the EU.

The annual song contest is run by the European Broadcasting Union, and a spokesman said it would require the Scottish broadcaster to re-apply for entry once it leaves the Royaume Uni, as our country is known at Eurovision.

Application involves a complicated list of criteria they would have to meet – and Scotland would not be guaranteed admittance.

Kosovo is not able to enter the song contest, in part because of the opposition of Serbia, the country it seceded from six years ago.

And Spain has warned that it will not allow its own potentially breakaway region of Catalonia to join international institutions.

It raises the prospect that countries such as Spain, which are against the idea of separatism, could make it difficult for Scotland to join up.

EBU spokesman Jarmo Siim, who represents Eurovision, said: ‘Only active members of the EBU can take part in the Eurovision Song Contest and there is a certain membership process. No automatic memberships are granted.’

Mr Siim also said that the rest of the UK might not get its free pass into the Eurovision final if Scotland secedes.

At present, the largest countries in Europe – the UK, France, Germany and Spain – do not have to go through the semi-final process because their broadcasters largely fund the EBU.

‘Concerning the rest of the UK, it is hard to say whether any changes will occur in this,’ he said.

‘However, it would be up to the organisers to take a decision on this when the situation arises.’It seems certain however that an independent Scotland would have to go through the semi-final process, decreasing its chances of winning.
