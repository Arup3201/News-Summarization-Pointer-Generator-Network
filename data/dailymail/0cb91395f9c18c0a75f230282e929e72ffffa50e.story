In
 rehab:  Documents said to be Formula One legend Michael Schumacher’s medical notes have been stolen, according to his manager

French police investigating the theft 
of Michael Schumacher's hospital notes have asked for help from their 
Swiss and German counterparts after emails sent by the thieves were 
traced to Zurich.

The 
request by a French prosecutor comes after emails sent to news 
organisations offering to sell the notes were tracked to an Internet 
Protocol (IP) address in Switzerland's biggest city.

The
 emails, signed Kagemusha, which is Japanese for 'shadow warrior', offer
 the notes from Schumacher's nearly six-month stay in Grenoble Hospital 
after a nearly fatal skiiing accident left him in a coma.

The thieves were asking for 40,000 euros (£32,000; $55,000) for the dossier.

The
 Local reports that the documents, stolen over a week ago, comprise 11 
or 12 pages of notes made by a doctor during the former racing driver's 
treatment.

A Grenoble prosecutor announced the request for help yesterday.

Swiss
 media reported the tracking of the thieves' IP address across the 
border to Switzerland, but French officials would not comment on the 
claim, according to The Local.

Each
 connection to the Internet has a unique IP address which can be traced 
to a specific location.

However, services do exist which allow Internet 
users to hide their true location by masquerading as a different 
address.

The latest 
developments come after Schumacher's manager, Sabine Kehm, threatened 
legal action if any of her client's medical information was made public.

She
 said last week:  'For several days stolen documents and data are being 
offered for sale. The offerer claims them to be the medical file of 
Michael Schumacher.

'We 
cannot judge if these documents are authentic. However, the documents 
are clearly stolen. The theft has been reported. The authorities are 
involved.

'We expressly 
advise that both the purchase and the publication of such documents and 
data is forbidden. The contents of any medical files are totally private
 and confidential and must not made available to the public.

'We
 will therefore, in every single case, press for criminal charges and 
damages against any publication of the content or reference to the 
medical file. We trust for your understanding.'

The
 University Hospital of the Canton of Vaud (CHUV) in Lausanne, where 
Schumacher was transferred from a French hospital to begin a lengthy 
rehabilitation regime after his terrible skiing accident left him in a 
coma

It
 is 26 weeks since Schumacher was left in a coma after suffering his a 
serious brain injury while skiing off-piste with his son. He was 
holidaying with family and friends in Meribel, where he owns a chalet.

There
 were claims he had his eyes and was conscious as he was transferred 
from Grenoble to University Hospital Lausanne, Switzerland, on June 16, 
to begin his rehabilitation.

It was said that Schumacher, 45, was able to communicate to ambulance staff by nodding his head.

The
 report in the Swiss tabloid Blick stated that the ambulance was 
operated by Sanitätoberwallis, a company based in Visp in the canton of 
Valais rather than from Grenoble or Lausanne.

Ambulance
 staff were not told the identity of the world-famous patient in 
advance. They also had to relinquish their mobile phones on arrival at 
Grenoble.

Matthias Volken, 
medical superintendent of the ambulance firm, said: 'I can confirm that 
we carried out the drive to transfer (Schumacher) on Monday.'

The paper said Schumacher had lost a lot of weight during his 170 days in hospital since the accident.

The hospital where he is now being treated is one of Switzerland’s best and has renowned neurology experts.
