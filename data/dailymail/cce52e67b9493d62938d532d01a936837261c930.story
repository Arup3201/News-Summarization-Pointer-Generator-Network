A pensioner who has used a stairwell balcony to dry her clothes for 25 years has been told to stop by council officials who say it is a fire hazard.

Margaret Jowsey, 70, doesn't have a balcony at her top-floor Norwich council flat and says she has never received any complaints about her using the space.

But health and safety bosses have now ordered her to stop.

Officers at Norwich City Council claim her damp clothes are a fire hazard and fear somebody could trip over her washing line in an emergency.

In a letter to Ms Jowsey the council also said communal areas needed to be kept clear to enable repairs, and that as a landlord they had to 'work with our residents to minimise this risk'.

Ms Jowsey said she had no option but to dry her washing on the stairwell: 'I’m on a low income so I can’t afford to go to the laundrette and I don’t have room for a tumble dryer.

'I just can’t believe they’re trying to stop me putting my washing out after all this time.'

Ms Jowsey works three nights a week as a carer and says she knows all about health and safety.

'A washing line ban is way beyond common sense.

'You could say there should be a sprinkler on the stairs instead.

'The postman has never hung himself up on our washing line and when workmen come they’ve never had a problem.

Ms Jowsey's flat does not have a balcony and she does not want to dry her washing indoors for fear of mildew

'So what’s this all about then?

'It’s just people with a bit of power, that’s all.'

Ms Jowsey does not want to dry her washing indoors for fear of mildew.

She
 has vowed to keep drying her washing in the stairwell and her son, 
Lawrence, 43, who lives with her, has launched a petition against the 
ban.

Despite being told council officials will remove her clothes and charge her for doing so, Ms Jowsey has vowed to keep using the balcony and her son has launched a petition against the ban

He said: 'You have to stand up for what you believe in.

'That’s a laundry line.

'This ban is going against our human rights.'

Councillor Brenda Arthur, leader of Labour-ruled Norwich City Council, said the council was 'very happy' to talk to Ms Jowsey about her concerns.

He said: 'We want to talk to residents and work with them to find alternative ways to accommodate their needs.

'Separately to this, I know Cllr Bert Bremner, as the cabinet member for housing, has asked officers to carry out an immediate review on the use of communal areas to ensure that a common sense approach prevails.'

The ban comes after award-winning Norwich gardener, Kerry Annison, was warned last year that her pot plants were a health and safety danger and must be removed.

Council officers ordered the 48-year-old to remove her plants from a balcony which leads up to her former council flat.

They acted just months after she had been presented with a prize for them by the city’s Lord Mayor.
