A senior Russian aide today blasted the Ukrainian government 'a Nazi Frankenstein' as the crisis-hit country signed a 'historic' trade deal with the European Union.

Outspoken Sergei Glazyev said the Ukrainian leader's endorsement of an historic pact with the EU was 'illegitimate'.

The signing earlier today by Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko in Brussels puts his country on track for eventual EU membership while taking a giant symbolic step away from Moscow's orbit.

The extraordinary Nazi jibe from Glazyev - a key architect of Putin's strategy on Crimea and Ukraine - highlights a deep loathing between those close to the Kremlin leader and the new government in Kiev.

'Europe is trying to push Ukraine to sign this agreement by force,' the Russian president's adviser on regional economic integration told the BBC.

'They organised a military coup in Ukraine, they helped Nazis to come to power. This Nazi government is bombing the largest region in Ukraine.'

Asked if he believed Mr Poroshenko was a Nazi he replied: 'Of course.'

He warned that people in the EU would regret bringing Ukraine into the fold.

'The European public will be... surprised when this Nazi Frankenstein, which was born by the Euro bureaucrats and some politicians, will knock on the European countries' doors,' he claimed.

Poroshenko was an 'illegitimate' president because parts of eastern Ukraine did not vote in May elections, so he had no right to sign today's EU accord.

The deal between the 28-country European Union and Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia concerns broad trade and economic agreements.

The closer relationship with the EU led to protests against the old pro-Russian Viktor Yankuvych, who did not want today's agreement to proceed.

President Poroshenko described today's agreement as 'the most important day' for his country since independence from the Soviet Union.

He said: 'It's absolutely a new perspective for my country.'

The failure of former president Yanukovych to sign the deal precipitated the current crisis.

President Porshenko said he signed the agreement with the same pen Yanukovych was supposed to use last year.

He said: 'Historic events are unavoidable.'

President Poroshenko reminded EU 
leaders of the Ukrainians who died opposing Yanukovych's government and 
in the ongoing battle against the pro-Russian insurgency in the 
country's east.

He said Ukraine 'paid the highest possible price to make
 her European dreams come true.'

He asked EU leaders to take a further step and formally pledge that one day Ukraine can join the EU as a full-fledged member.

That 'would cost the European Union nothing,' he said, 'but would mean the world to my country.'

As part of the agreement, Ukraine has to accept EU product regulations as well as introducing new rules on copyright, government contracts and reducing corruption.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for restraint in Ukraine following a recent escalation in violence along Ukraine's eastern border with Russia

Russian President Vladimir Putin said the most important thing was to guarantee a 'long-term cease fire' in Ukraine

Glazyev's attack seemed at odds with Putin's moves in recent days to help the peace process - and avoid a threatened new round of crippling sanctions.

The controversial aide recently called on Putin to destroy Ukraine's military capability and met separatists in eastern regions who are seeking to join Russia. 

Russian President Vladimir Putin did not immediately comment on the trade pact, but in recent days has signaled that he wants to de-escalate the conflict ahead of talks later Friday by the EU's heads of state and government on whether to ramp up sanctions against Russia over its conduct toward Ukraine.

He said: 'The most important thing is to guarantee a long-term cease-fire as a precondition for meaningful talks between the Kiev authorities and representatives of the southeast (of Ukraine).'

The U.N. said Friday that 110,000 Ukrainians had fled to Russia this year and another 54,000 fled their homes but stayed in Ukraine as the government fought with separatists in the mostly Russian-speaking east.

The European Commission believes the new trade deal could boost Ukraine's national income by €1.2 billion a year.
