'Perfect match': 'You could feel the love Michelle and Clay have for each other, one wedding guest said. 'They are truly a perfect match'

Stately: The ceremony, held at First Unitarian Church in Providence, was attended by about 250 guests, with Rhode Island's governor, among them

Newlyweds: Kwan reportedly met Pell in April 2011 and the couple were engaged to marry in September of 2012

Medals: Kwan is reportedly the most decorated figure skater in U.S. history, earning two Olympic medals, five World Championships and a record-tying nine national titles during her long-and-storied career

'You could feel the love Michelle and Clay have for each other, a guest told the magazine's website. 'They are truly a perfect match.'

Pell, a 31-year-old JAG lawyer and Coast Guard lieutenant, works on the White House's national security staff.

He is the grandson of the late Rhode Island Sen. Claiborne Pell, who reportedly established Pell Grants to assist college students with in paying their tuition 40 years ago.

Kwan is a public policy envoy with the U.S. State Department and the most decorated figure skater in American history.

Fans of Kwan's performance at the 2002 Winter games might have recognized a certain nostalgic touch from Saturday.

During those Salt Lake City games, Kwan skated her routine to Sting's song, 'Fields of Gold.'

She once again utilized the tune for her wedding, incorporating it, according to People, into the day's proceedings.

'Magnetic Connection': Kwan and Pell reportedly were in love at first sight after meeting in April 2011, according to interviews that the figure skater has given about her fairy tale romance

Uniformed police officers stood guard outside the church as the 32-year-old Kwan and her bridesmaid emerged from a club across the street from the church, The Providence Journal reports.

Once inside the church, the new couple exchanged self-written vows, and even spontaneously kissed before being prompted to do so by the ceremony's officiant.

'A few minutes later,' the guest told People, 'the minister said, 'And for their second first kiss as Mr. and Mrs. Clay Pell,' and everyone laughed.'

Kwan engaged to marry Pell Sept. 3, and shortly thereafter told People, 'I never was one who believed in love at first sight, but I have to admit it happened for us.

'I felt there was a magnetic connection between us,' she explained of their April 2011 initial meeting. 'I thought he was the one from the beginning.'

'It was a simple decision and it made sense, that's what's so exciting to me,' Kwan elaborated in an interview with People. 'We are working together as a team, like in [pair skating].'

Reportedly added Pell: 'It was amazing from the very beginning how in sync our way of thinking is, our basic values and our sense of priorities. We just both got each other.'

Back in September, Pell proposed on Block Island, off the coast of Rhode Island.

Deep bond: 'I felt there was a magnetic connection between us,' Kwan said about their April 2011 meeting. 'I thought he was the one from the beginning'
