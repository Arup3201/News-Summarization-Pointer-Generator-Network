Roy Hodgson has confirmed Wayne Rooney will stay as a striker for England, adding that it doesn't matter where he plays for Manchester United.

The 29-year-old has played most of this season in midfield under Louis van Gaal, but started in a more advanced role and got his first goal of 2015 during their 3-1 victory over Preston in the FA Cup on Monday night - albeit from a penalty.

But England boss Hodgson insists that as long as his and United's captain is playing well, then the position he's playing in is largely irrelevant.

'It doesn't really matter to me [where he plays],' said Hodgson. 'Club coaches have different personnel - it doesn't matter as long as he’s playing well.

'I know if we want him to move he can play like he does tonight (Monday), with enthusiasm and passion.

'It's incredible that he does so well so often in different positions. It can't be easy when a manager wants you to play in a position you don't know well - but keeps doing so, I'm pleased for him.

'At the moment I'd like to see him as a key figure for us as a centre forward and it would take a lot before I’d start to think along those lines [Rooney as a midfielder]. 

'He’s our captain and nearly the record goalscorer. It would take a lot from a 19 or 20-year-old to replace a man up front with over 100 caps, there’d be a lot of pressure.
