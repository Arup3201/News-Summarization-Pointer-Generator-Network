A pocketbook with a mobile phone and ID belonging to a missing prostitute who sparked the ‘Craigslist Ripper’ investigation has been found.

Shannan Gilbert, 24, of Jersey City, New Jersey, went missing in May 2010 on Long Island in New York. A pair of jeans and shoes were also found.

Her remains have still not been located 18 months on - but the search has so far helped officers make the gruesome discoveries of 10 other bodies.

‘I just don’t know what to think right now,’ her mother Mari Gilbert told the New York Post. ‘You try to just hold out hope of some kind.’

Police are not linking her to the other 10 people, some of whom advertised as escorts on Craigslist, believed to have been murdered by a serial killer.

But search teams have focussed on marshland because they thought damage from Tropical Storm Irene may have unearthed new evidence.

Mari Gilbert said she does not think her daughter drowned accidentally, because she could not swim and never went near water.

‘I don’t buy the drowning theory for a second,’ she told the New York Post. 'She would never have gone close to any sort of water.’

Michael Pak was her driver on the night she went missing and claims the latest finding suggests she could have fallen into the water herself, if her phone or wallet was found still in her purse.

‘Shannan always wanted to be famous - and now she is famous,’ Mr Pak, of Jersey City, told the New York Post.

Meanwhile, it was claimed last week the serial killer may have learnt how to cover his tracks by watching television crime dramas like CSI.

Also discovered: In March police found the head and forearm of 20-year-old Jessica Taylor whose torso had been found in 2003, also on Long Island

An investigation officer said a familiarity with such shows could explain how he has avoided capture and delayed the identification of his victims.

Police are looking for a single killer 
for the deaths of eight women, a man and a baby whose remains have been 
found over the past year.

The first four found last December were Amber Lynn Costello, 27, Megan Waterman, 22, Melissa Barthelemy, 24, and Maureen Brainer-Barnes, 25.

In March they found the head and forearm of 20-year-old Jessica Taylor whose torso had been found in 2003, also on Long Island.

By April they had discovered the remains of three more women, a young Asian man aged between 17 and 23 and a toddler.
