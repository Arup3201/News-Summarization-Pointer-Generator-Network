Joy McFadden, 31, and Jarmal Dixon, 25, were spotted in the backyard on Warley St, Florence engaged in a sexual act on Friday morning.

It is unclear whose property the Warley St yard is, since neither McFadden nor Dixon are residents of the street.

SCNow reports police arrived at the property to find McFadden and Dixon mostly naked and 'in a compromising position'.

Police arrested McFadden and Dixon and charged them with indecent exposure.

They were booked at the Florence County Detention Center in Effingham.

Joy McFadden is from Mullins and Jarmal Dixon lives in Florence, South Carolina.

In South Carolina, indecent exposure carries a maximum term of three years imprisonment.

The law states that it is 'unlawful for a person to wilfully, maliciously, and indecently expose his person in a public place, on property of others, or to the view of any person on a street or highway.'

Anyone convicted of indecent exposure faces a fine or imprisonment.

'Any person who violates the provisions... must be fined in the discretion of the court or imprisoned not more than three years, or both,' according to law.

McFadden and Dixon remain in custody awaiting a bond hearing.
