As they took their first steps together on the campaign trail today, it was revealed that Paul Ryan's path to becoming Mitt Romney's Republican vice-presidential running mate was steeped in secrecy, from an incognito trip to meet Romney to a furtive walk through the woods at his boyhood Wisconsin home.

The head of Romney's VP search process, longtime confidante Beth Myers, broke her silence on many details in a briefing with reporters inside a hangar at Dulles International Airport near Washington. Romney and Ryan themselves spoke to reporters briefly on their flight to North Carolina.

Almost a week ago, Ryan snuck through Chicago's O'Hare airport in a baseball cap and sunglasses and flew to New England.

Myer's 19-year-old son picked up Ryan and drove him to a private meeting in his parents' dining room where the deal was sealed.

By Friday afternoon, Ryan was cutting
through the Wisconsin woods behind his home to evade a reporter on the 
street out front, and heading to North Carolina.

By night, he was eating
Applebee's takeout at a nondescript chain hotel in that state and 
preparing for his big debut speech, according to Myers.

The search for VP was so confidential that background
information on a short list of candidates, including several years of 
tax returns and other documents, were kept in a safe in a locked room at
Romney's campaign headquarters and the few people allowed in were not 
permitted to make copies or take anything out.

What
began in April as a long list of candidates was winnowed down to a 
short list by May 1. By early July, the serious candidates had emerged.

Romney knew Ryan was his man before Ryan knew. After
extensive deliberations over his short list, Romney settled on the 
42-year-old Wisconsin congressman who has built a conservative record as
a budget hawk in Washington. Romney made up his mind on August 1, the 
day after he returned from a week-long trip to London, Jerusalem and 
Poland.

A face-to-face meeting was 
required, and therein lies a tale. The meeting was arranged for August 5 at
Myers' home in Brookline, Massachusetts.

The challenge was to get both 
Ryan and Romney together in the same room without the news media or 
anyone else outside the inner circle knowing about it.

Myers'
home was chosen for the assignation. Romney had little problem eluding 
the news media camped out near his vacation home on Lake Winnepesaukee 
in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire.

It was getting Ryan there that was the challenge.

To
avoid flying out of a Wisconsin airport where he could be easily 
recognized, he was driven to Chicago's O'Hare airport for a flight to 
Hartford's Bradley airport in Connecticut.

'We
gave a lot of thought on how to make this work undetected,' Myers said. 'And we sent my 19-year-old son, Curt, to pick him up.

'Paul was wearing
jeans, a casual shirt, baseball hat and sunglasses and passed unnoticed
through both airports.'

Romney and Ryan met privately more than an hour in Myers' dining room after lunch.

'We
talked about the campaign, how it would be run,' Romney said. 'We 
talked about how we'd work together if we get to the White house, what 
the relationship would be, how we would interact and be involved in 
important decisions.'

Ryan said being chosen was like going 'from the surreal to the real, I guess.'

'By
the time we met in person I kinda knew it was going to happen. And I 
was very humbled. It was the biggest honor I've ever been given in my 
life,' he said.

Then came the 
problem of getting Ryan to Norfolk for the rollout announcement without 
the news media sleuthing it out. Such movements have been detected 
before.

They wanted to do the 
announcement on Friday in New Hampshire but Ryan needed to attend a 
memorial service in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, for victims of a mass shooting
at a Sikh temple.

After that 
ceremony, Ryan was driven to his home in Janesville, Wisconsin, by aide 
Andy Speth. He walked in the front door, through the house and out the 
back door, into a patch of woods familiar from his youth.

On the other side was the house where he grew up.

'I
know those woods like the back of my hand, so it wasn't too hard to 
walk through them,' Ryan said. 'So I just went out my back door and went
through the gully in the woods I grew up playing in. I walked by the 
tree that has the old tree fort that I built.'

When
he came out into the open, Speth was there to pick him up. Ryan flew 
from Waukegan to Elizabeth City, North Carolina, which is not far from 
Norfolk. He and his family and Myers and a Romney group stayed at a 
Fairfield Inn, ordered in food from Applebee's and went over Ryan's 
introductory speech.

'It's now two on two instead of two on one,' said Romney. 'This is good.'Â
