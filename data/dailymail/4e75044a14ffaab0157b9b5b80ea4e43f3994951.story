Twenty Roma parents and other family members who sent their own children on to the streets of Paris to rob holidaymakers were beginning prison sentences of up to eight years each yesterday.

British visitors were among the hundreds of tourists targeted each day around the Louvre, Notre Dame and the Eiffel Tower by some 40 youngsters.

There were disturbances in the court late on Friday afternoon when the tough sentences were handed down. The heaviest went to women – including mothers – involved in the crime network.

In action: Roma children snatch catch in Paris. Twenty Roma parents and other family members who sent their children on to the streets to rob holidaymakers were beginning prison sentences of up to eight years each

The senior judge of three involved in the case, Dominique Piot, said: ‘Each minor had to steal two wallets a day, or two or three mobile telephones.’

He said those imprisoned were ‘involved in industrial-scale exploitation of their own children’. Comparing them to modern-day Fagins, he said that children who failed in their targets were often beaten.

The offences took place between 2011 and 2012, and  the youngsters involved were aged between nine and 17.

Two women and one man were sentenced to eight years, while  a woman and a man got seven years each. All were permanently banned from France.

Prime Minister Manuel Valls has continued a policy started by former president Nicolas Sarkozy of razing Roma camps and deporting their occupants.

Roma child gangs operate openly in the city. Those arrested are usually released without charge within hours because of their age.
