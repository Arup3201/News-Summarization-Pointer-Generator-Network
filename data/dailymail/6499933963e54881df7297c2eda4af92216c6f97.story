Caught out: John Lindsey Hollingworth, 60, pocketed £26,000 pounds in disability hand outs after claiming he struggled to walk, only to be filmed playing golf

A benefits cheat who pocketed £26,000 pounds in disability hand outs after claiming he struggled to walk was caught out after being filmed playing golf.

John Lindsey Hollingworth, 60, received Disability Living Allowance, claiming he suffered from arthritis, back pain and gout, which he said caused difficulties when walking short distances or driving.

However, the only handicap he could honestly lay claim to having, was the one he played off each week at his local 18 hole golf club.

Investigators put Hollingworth under surveillance and were stunned to discover the fraudster had an impressive handicap of six after playing regularly in competitions at Chorley Golf Club in Lancashire.

Today Preston Magistrates Court heard that Hollingworth had started to receive disability benefits legitimatley in August 1997, but failed to notify the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) in 2001, when he was fit enough to join his local golf club.

Andrea Fawcett, prosecuting, told the 
court that Hollingworth had regularly played the 'strenuous sport' at 
the 127 acre course for more than a decade before being put under 
surveillance in October 2012.

She said: 'The surveillance showed Mr Hollingworth playing golf frequently and driving to and from the course.

'He played competitively and had a golf handicap in the single figures.

'Towards
 the end of 2012, information was received by the department which 
suggested Mr Hollingworth might not be as disabled as he was claiming.'

On
 December 20, 2012, Hollingworth was arrested and interviewed by police 
but maintained he was unable to walk significant distances and said he 
had difficulty sitting and standing.

Then
 in January last year he admitted to playing competitive golf on a 
regular basis but told police it was because he required exercise to 
help with the pain caused by his health issues.

On the day his trial was due to start,
 Hollingworth, from Chorley, was informed he had been filmed playing 
golf and those recordings were ready to be played to the court - and changed his plea to guilty.

Nigel Beeson, defending, said the footage showed a man clearly 'in a position to swing a golf club.'

Sentencing him, bench chairman John Connor said: 'You committed fraud for over ten years.

'You dishonestly failed to notify changes in your circumstances. You were given ample opportunity to come clean but you failed to do that.

'You knew exactly what you were doing.'

Hollingworth, who struggled to stand up in court and had to use the wall for support, made no reaction as he was given a 16 week sentence, suspended for two years.

He was also fitted with an electronic tag and given a six month curfew from the hours of 7pm to 7am.

Hollingworth was ordered to pay £200 pounds in court costs and an £80 victim surcharge, before limping out of court.

Vernon Sanderson, DWP fraud manager in the North West, said: 'It is our duty to ensure that benefit payments go to those who really need them and we are committed to cracking down on those who play the system.

'Our welfare reforms are vital to close the gaps that cheats take advantage of.

'It is unfair that some people get support when they do not have a disability, while many people depend on the benefits system to provide a safety net.

'Deliberately not informing us of a change in your condition that may affect your claim is a crime.

'Don’t wait for our fraud investigators to find you. Tell us of a change now.'
