A would-be suicide bomber, a jihadi fighter and an extremist who trained with the failed 21/7 attackers are among six terror suspects who will have restrictions lifted in just two months.

The British citizens, aged 25 to 39, all have close links to Pakistan, Somalia and Iran. They have all been under the supervision of MI5 thanks to Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Orders, which involve tagging, restricting their movements and who they can talk to.

But, according to The Sun, the orders expire on January 26 after two years - and so far Liberal Democrat ministers have refused to allow their renewal.

Six terror suspects could be roaming the streets without restrictions when their control orders expire in January. One is linked to the failed bomb attack on July 21, 2005, two weeks after the atrocity which killed 52, above

The orders can only be renewed if there is fresh evidence of terror-related activity. So far Lib Dem MPs have refused to tighten the laws surrounding the restrictions

TPIMs replaced stricter Control Orders in January 2012 under a coalition deal to bolster suspects' civil liberties.

Suspect 1: A British man, 25. Involved in liquid bomb plot to blow up transatlantic flights.

Suspect 2: British train driver, 31, married with three children. Went to Pakistan for terror training in '08.

Suspect 3: Thirty-nine, British, married with five children. Funded brothers' terror activities in Pakistan.

Suspect 4: Trained in 2004 with failed 21/7 bombers. Plotted attacks on UK. Aged 29.

Suspect 5: Iranian/British, 29, went to Somalia in 2006 for training.

Suspect 6: In Afghanistan to fight western troops in 2008 and had terror training in Somalia in 2009. Fought with al-Shabaab.

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper warned Home Secretary Theresa May she 'needs to heed the advice of experts, ourselves and even their own Mayor of London'.

She said: 'We need to know there is a plan in place for each individual based on the threat they pose. Ministers should be looking urgently at whether any of those TPIMs should be extended based on the police and the courts' view of the impact on public safety.'

The six suspects were initially issued with Control Orders by a judge when it proved impossible to convict them for legal reasons.

They were among ten people given TPIMs, two of whom have absconded. A new TPIM can only be issued if there is new evidence of terror-related activity.

A spokesman for the Home Office did not deny the allegations. He said: 'TPIMs are just one weapon in the considerable armoury at the disposal of our police and security services. They have received tens of millions of pounds of extra funding to step up surveillance and secure more prosecutions of terror suspects.'
