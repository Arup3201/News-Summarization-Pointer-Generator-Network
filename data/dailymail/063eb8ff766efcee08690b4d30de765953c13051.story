Emad Karakrah, 49, was charged after fleeing police in Chicago on Wednesday

A man has been arrested after leading a police chase through Chicago while allegedly flying the flag of Islamic extremist group ISIS  from his car.

Emad Karakrah, 49, also allegedly threatened to bomb police when he was pulled over on Wednesday.  

Police approached the driver after 911 reports of a 'suspicious person' in a silver car shortly after 9am.

He refused to stop and patrol cars were forced to chase him through the city as he ran red lights.

When he was finally apprehended, Karakrah told police he would detonate a bomb he had in his car, according to a police report seen by NBC.

The threat led to the bomb squad, FBI and Homeland Security being called but after extensive searches, no explosives were discovered. 

He has been charged with felony disorderly conduct for making a false bomb threat and aggravated fleeing and a misdemeanor count of driving on a never-issued license. 

The 49-year-old appeared in court and was held on $55,000 bond on Thursday. 

He is due back in court on September 3. 

The incident is another troubling example of the alleged creeping presence of ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham) in Chicago, a city which terrorists have reportedly made a target because it is 'Obama Town'.

Last week, the FBI and Homeland Security warned police forces across the country to be on the lookout for threats as a chilling note was posted online warning that Chicago could be an ISIS target.

According to ABC, the bulletin read: 'Because of the individualized nature of the radicalization process – it is difficult to predict triggers that will contribute to [homegrown violent extremists] attempting acts of violence.' 

Chicago in particular has become a prime target because extremist groups think of it as 'Obama Town', a security expert told CBS.

A tweet, posted on June 20, has been discovered, showing pictures of the Old Republic Building in Chicago and the White House with a message reportedly from the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL).

It reads: 'We are in your state/We are in your cities/We are in your streets/You are our goals anywhere.'

President Obama admitted on Thursday that his administration were yet to come up with a plan to defeat ISIS as the group continued its brutal rampage across Iraq and Syria. 

'I don't want to put the cart before the horse,' Obama said at the White House. 'We don't have a strategy yet.'

His remarks came as the Islamic State released another chilling decapitation video, threatening America and urging the Kurds to break from their alliance with the West against the caliphate.

Just hours after the extremists released shocking footage of the mass execution of 300 Syrian national army soldiers in the Syrian desert, ISIS issued a second warning to the U.S.

The grainy video, accompanied by the hashtag '2ndAmessagetoAmerica', shows the vicious beheading of a Kurdish soldier, who was part of a group of 15 fighters likely to have been captured by Islamic State during the fighting in Iraq.

The group's first warning ten days ago was entitled 'A Message to America' and showed the decapitation of American journalist James Foley.
