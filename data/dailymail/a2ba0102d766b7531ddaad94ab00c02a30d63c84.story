For Rafael Nadal the Rod Laver Arena, centre court of the Australian Open, might be better named the House of Pain.

Exhausting marathons, knee and back injuries, retirements, shattering defeats and now cramps in his stomach and elsewhere. 

He has been through them all there, apart from when winning the title in 2009.

VIDEO  Australian Open: Rafa Nadal wins 2-6 6-3 7-6 3-6 5-7 vs Tim Smyczek

Rafael Nadal had to dig deep to overcome illness and poor form in order to defeat Tim Smyczek

It is hard to see him replicating that triumph this time around, the evidence coming in his dramatic 6-2, 3-6, 6-7, 6-3, 7-5 win over little-known American Tim Smyczek. 

For long spells it seemed the world No 112 was going to remove Andy Murray’s potential semi-final opponent, assuming the British player survives his coming third round against Portugal’s Joao Sousa. Nadal has banked precious little in the way of wins or confidence since Wimbledon last year. 

That was a major factor in the physical difficulties which he just about overcame to see off a player who was beaten by GB No 4 Liam Broady in his usual Challenger circuit environment less than three months ago.

He referred to cramps in different parts of his body as the reason for his undulating performance, against an albeit inspired opponent. ‘I was suffering,’ he said.

What is sure is that Nadal’s warrior fighting instinct has survived his long lay-off, although he cannot have felt the cramps for a sustained period as it is simply not possible to play tennis of this intensity over a match of nearly four and a quarter hours if you are continually ill.

Before Murray can contemplate any semi-final, he must overcome the speedy Sousa, who has an unlikely connection with Jose Mourinho.

Sousa is the Chelsea manager’s relatively humble stablemate in the management group controlled by ‘Super Agent’ Jorge Mendes, who also looks after Cristiano Ronaldo.

But so far removed from Mendes’ star clients is Sousa that he has never even met Mourinho, unlike Murray, who has done rehab work at their Cobham facility and consulted him privately several times about how to handle the pressure of top-level sport.

Sousa, the world No 55, is under no illusions about his own status. ‘I have never called myself the Special One, not even close,’ he said.

Mourinho turned up at the O2 Arena in November, only to see Murray hammered by Roger Federer at the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals.

But Sousa has not got that close. ‘I haven’t had the honour of meeting him but he is one of the greatest professionals in sport. I hope to meet him one day,’ he said.

Murray made it through with an extremely comfortable 6-1, 6-3, 6-2 win over Australia’s Marinko Matosevic.

Also through is Roger Federer, who was bitten by something on the tip of the small finger of his right hand, causing some slight swelling.

He was still able to beat Italian Simone Bolelli 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2.

Murray’s biggest irritation since being here has been being woken at 6am last week for a random blood test which was ordered by UK anti-doping. He stressed, though, that he was in favour of the increased testing taking place in tennis through its biological passport programme.

‘It was 6am a few days before a major. What time is unreasonable?’ he asked. ‘But they need to do it, definitely more. I think everyone is getting tested here when they lose, so for me it would be three tests in two weeks or so, a lot more than it used to be.’

You would expect him to get past Sousa to set up a possible fourth round against Grigor Dimitrov. When they played in the second round here two years ago, Sousa only managed to win eight games.

Murray has a record against Australians that England’s touring cricketers would love to emulate, leading them 10-0 over the course of his career. And Matosevic spoke very highly of the Scot’s form.

‘That’s the best Andy’s played against me,’ he said. ‘He was good at the French when he beat me and went on to the semis, at Queen’s when he went on to win there and then Wimbledon, but this was pretty impressive.

‘He can go all the way. He has a tough passage in the second week with Federer, Nadal, but he can win it.
