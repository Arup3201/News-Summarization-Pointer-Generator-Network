Elizabeth Surrey has appeared in court accused of misconduct in public office after concerns were raised over her behaviour while working at HMP Chelmsford

A female prison officer accused of having an inappropriate relationship with an inmate has appeared in court.

Elizabeth Surrey, 25, from Chelmsford, Essex, is accused of misconduct in public office after concerns were raised over her behaviour while working at HMP Chelmsford between March 11 and April 5.

The charge relates to claims she sent cards, letters and emails to a serving prisoner, received a personal phone call from the convict, showed the prisoner her cleavage and removed his ID card from the category B jail and failed to return it.

She appeared at Chelmsford Magistratesâ€™ Court this morning but entered no plea.

Surrey, who has been suspended from duty, spoke only to confirm her name and address.

She was released on unconditional bail until the next hearing at Chelmsford Crown Court on September 16.

HMP Chelmsford is a Category B men's prison and young offenders' institution.

The prison began as a county jail in 1830 but was later transformed into a Category B prison, a young person's prison and a local prison in 1987.

It was expanded in 1996 to relieve overcrowding but in January the Ministry of Justice announced parts of the prison would close.

The charge relates to claims she showed her cleavage to a prisoner at Chelmsford (file picture) and sent the convict cards, letters and emails

The decision meant there would be a reduction of 132 places at the site.

The Chief Inspector of Prisons criticised the management at the prison in 1999 after finding staff were failing to respond to cell alarms.

In 2005 however, Chelmsford was praised for improving standards and procedures for inmates.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
