With her long blonde hair, blue eyes and pale complexion, Alexandra Jenkins was constantly compared to Queen Elsa by customers while working as a John Lewis shop assistant.

The 20-year-old would even be pestered by young Frozen fans who kept mistaking her for the fictional Disney character on a daily basis.

Now Alexandra, who was forced to wear a disguise to look less like the cartoon queen, has decided to embrace her features - and has launched a career as a lookalike.

Alexandra Jenkins was pestered by children who constantly mistook her for Disney's Queen Elsa

Alexandra, from Portbury, Bristol, now leads a double life, appearing at children's parties and corporate events during the evening and at weekends.

She said her new venture became an obvious option after an increasing number of people began comparing her to the Disney princess.

And she has even started singing lessons to perform Let It Go.

'It all kind of took off in January last year really. I was told by a lot of people I looked similar to Elsa and then it just kind of escalated from there,' she said.

'By the start of December I was getting told I looked like Elsa all the time; I get parents come up to me all the time telling me I look like Elsa, as well as the kids.'

Alexandra says she can't go a day without someone pointing out her likeness to the Frozen character, right

As well as continuing her job at John Lewis Alexandra can now be hired to appear at children's parties

Alexandra says that she was 'recognised' so often by customers at John Lewis that she took to wearing thick spectacles in order to disguise herself.

'At work the only thing which is able to disguise me is the fact I have glasses, or sometimes wearing my hear down works,' she said.

'If I don't wear my glasses, or even when I do sometimes, the likelihood is I get a lot of people coming up to me telling me I look like Elsa.

'Over the summer lots of kids come in to get their back to school stuff and they tell me I look like Elsa, or their parents start pointing me out.' 

Alexandra will often do a shift in the department store and then go straight on to make an appearance as Elsa

Due to her icy blonde hair and pale complexion it takes Alexandra under an hour to make a full transformation

Alexandra has worked in the children's clothes section in John Lewis at Cribbs Causeway, Bristol, for almost three years but has found it easy to incorporate her new career into her life.

Her blonde plait and poignant face-shape mean it only takes her half an hour to transform herself into the famous Princess after work or at weekends.

'My hair is real so I don't have to wear a wig which makes it a lot more believable for the kids.

'It takes me no longer than half an hour to transformed into Elsa, I just put on my dress, put my hair in plait and then put some purple eye shadow and the rest of my make-up on. 

Alexandra is so convincing as the Disney princess she was even offered the role of Elsa at Disneyland Paris

'The make up takes the longest amount of time but it really isn't a big job.'

Alexandra says that, thus far, her business has been a huge success and she has been thrilled with the response. 

'I've had a great reaction. People are always asking me if I do events or parties. It helps that I genuinely look like her. People stop me in the street quite a lot.'

Single Alexandra's likeness to Elsa has even been noticed by Disney who offered her the role of the character at Disneyland Paris.

Alexandra decided to turn it down but is now booked for around four appearances a week. 

She has even taken up singing lessons to perfect the voice of the popular film character making her likeness even more authentic.

'I'm having singing lessons at the moment so that I can perfect Let it Go,' she said.

Alexandra, who can be booked for children's parties, says she's surprised how much it's taken off

'With the role you get quite a lot of kids asking you to sing it, I don't want to let myself down. It also really helps you to get into character, blasting it out.'

Despite her triumphs, Alexandra says that her new job can be quite testing and she does occasionally resent her uncanny appearance with the Frozen star. 

'It can be frustrating sometimes. However much I look like her obviously I am still Alexandra as well and sometime people forget that.'

Despite this she adds that she is flattered to be compared to Elsa and is very grateful for the attention. 

'However it's lovely to be compared to such a popular character. People can obviously see the similarities as it draws attention to me all the time.

'I'm so surprised by how much it has taken off. There are so many other lookalikes around so I was amazed at how many people started booking me.'
