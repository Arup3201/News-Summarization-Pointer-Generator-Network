World Cup winner Andre Schurrle believes Chelsea may have found the extra ingredients needed to win titles in Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa.

The new Blues duo, signed for a combined £60million this summer, made an immediate impact as the title favourites opened their Barclays Premier League campaign with 3-1 win at promoted Burnley.

Former Atletico Madrid striker Costa lashed in a quickfire equaliser after Burnley had taken a shock lead while ex-Arsenal playmaker Fabregas was influential throughout and had a hand in two goals.

Pass master: And Fabregas provided two superb assists for Chelsea's second and third goals

Asked if the pair could make the difference, Schurrle said: 'Yes, I hope so. It was very good.

'I think for Diego it was a perfect start. For a striker to come in and score his first goal is always important.

'He played fantastic in the friendly, and he scored. And now his first goal in competition.

'Cesc was fantastic for me as well - he always had control of the game. He was always running; two assists.

'So it was a fantastic night for them both - but it was only the first match and we have to keep going.'

One of the Fabregas assists, to put Chelsea 2-1 ahead, was for Schurrle - and came out of the top drawer.

After a mazy run by Eden Hazard and a link with Branislav Ivanovic, Fabregas volleyed a well-weighted first-time pass into the box for Schurrle to run on to.

The German timed his run perfectly and tucked the ball home with the final touch of a move that contained 25 passes.

Fabregas earned the praise of manager Jose Mourinho and after the Spaniard was linked with Manchester United and a return to Arsenal, the Blues are pleased to have him.

Schurrle said: 'I think a player like Cesc - every team wants him.

'So we are happy that he decided for Chelsea. We are happy that he is a Blue now. I am 100 per cent sure he will help us this season.'

Schurrle himself is playing catch-up after his involvement in Germany's World Cup win meant a late start for pre-season training.

The 23-year-old said: 'I've only been training for two weeks after my holidays - it was from zero to 100, directly into team training and everything.

'So there's a lot of work for me, but I'm feeling good. I'm enjoying my game, I'm enjoying being on the pitch.

'I think the whole team played well. We had a lot of control, passes, good combinations. It was a lot of fun on the pitch."

Schurrle is now in his second season at Stamford Bridge following an £18million move from Bayer Leverkusen.

He has been linked with a move as Mourinho reshapes his squad but Schurrle has no intention of leaving and plans to use his World Cup experience to make a big impression.

He said: 'I enjoyed the World Cup a lot, so I got out of that with a lot of confidence.

'I am hungry, I want to achieve something with Chelsea. I want to win titles with Chelsea.

'It was a good start for me but when I am 100 per cent fit, there will be more.'

No 1: Thibaut Courtois was another to enjoy his Chelsea debut at Turf Moor on Monday night

Benched: Whilst previous regular Petr Cech cut something of a forlorn figure on the bench

All the goals at Turf Moor came in a 20-minute spell after Scott Arfield had rewarded the Clarets' early enthusiasm by rifling in a 14th-minute opener.

Costa pounced to level three minutes later after an Ivanovic cross was deflected onto the post and Fabregas then set up Schurrle before crossing for Ivanovic from a corner.

One of the main talking points was Mourinho's selection of goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who has returned from a successful loan at Atletico Madrid, in place of long-time number one Petr Cech.

Schurrle hopes it does not spell the end for Cech at the club.

He said: 'I hope he stays of course. He is a great character and is very important for the team.

'He is a fantastic keeper, one of the best. It's his decision what he wants to do, but everyone wants him to stay and with him we have a better squad.

'We will need everyone because hopefully we will have 50-60 matches in all competitions.'
