Controversial: Government expert David Norgrove, pictured, says that grandparents do 'damage' children during divorce cases

Badly behaved grandparents 'damage' children because they interfere in divorces and ramp up conflict between couples, it was claimed today.

Acrimonious couples also use their parents as 'weapons' to get one over their partners as they break-up, according to the Government's legal advisor on families.

David Norgrove has been leading a review on family law and said while he accepted that grandparents are often 'extremely important in a child’s life' they can be demanding when it comes to access to their grandchildren.

He says this can mean that children do not always come first in a bitter divorce, hurting the innocent youngsters involved.

'Grandparents can be used by parents as a way of getting at their ex-partner. Grandparents are not always straightforward in the way they behave and the result can be damage to children,' he said.

'Not all grandparents are good grandparents. One of the separating parents can use his or her parents as a weapon against the other partner.

'We should not be putting all the emphasis on the rights of the adults. The question is wrong: it should be what is in the best interests of the child, not what is right for the adults.'

Controversially his review has dashed fathers’ hopes of securing equal rights to share custody of their children in the event of a split.

He also rejected any claims that Grandparents also do badly after a divorce saying they must still go through the courts over access to children.

'There is no evidence that courts unreasonably refuse the ability of a grandparent to bring an application for contact with their grandchildren,' Mr Norgrove said.

A new DIY system is being proposed to speed up divorces away from court.

The 'divorce information hub' would be online with a step-by-step guide showing how to end a marriage legally as well as set up maintenance and access arrangements for children.

The new report suggests this route is the best way to keep parents and their children out of the courts.

New parenting agreements will help decide where the child will live and also how much contact the other parent will have.

The plan will mean that couples will only go to court as a last resort if the process above fails and they cannot agree.

But critics say that the Tory-ordered report does not follow through on their promises for equal rights for all family in child-access arrangements.

James Deuchars, of Grandparents Apart UK, said: ‘The Tories said before the election that grandparents were going to have more rights. This is a betrayal of that promise. It was all a con and a gimmick.'

Mr Norgrove's 220-page review has been denounced as a ‘betrayal’ of the family as mothers still have more rights.

Ken Sanderson, chief executive of Families Need Fathers, said the review's failure to recommend shared parenting legislation or a statement on the importance of both parents in law represents 'an abdication of their responsibilities to children and their families'.

'The core failing of the current family justice system is that the rights of children to maintain meaningful relationships with both parents, as set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, are not adequately supported or enforced,' he said.

Nadine O'Connor, campaign director of Fathers 4 Justice, added that the review was 'a monstrous sham and a bureaucratic exercise in improving the efficiency of injustice.'

The review called for parents to be encouraged to develop a parenting agreement 'to set out arrangements for the care of their children post-separation' to help eliminate disputes over contact and where the child should live.

Mr Norgrove's report is also suggesting that more parents should spend less time in 
court instead using 'do it yourself' websites where divorce forms can be
downloaded. 

The online process would force the couple into mediation before being put in front of a judge as a last resort. 

'At the moment it is very hard to get hold of the forms. The aim is to 
make it easier for people to do it themselves because the tendency is 
for it all to get out of control,' he said.

The report also called for the Government to develop a child arrangements order, which would set out plans for the upbringing of a child when a court is required to get involved.

These orders should also be available to grandparents and wider family members with the permission of the court.

The review also called for the duration of court cases to be restricted to six months - instead of the average 13 months now.

Mr Norgrove said that making children wait well over a year for their futures to be settled was 'shocking'.

'This is why we are recommending legislation to ensure that child protection cases must not be allowed to take any more than six months, save in exceptional circumstances,' he said.

He added: 'Every year 500,000 children and adults are involved in the family justice system. They turn to it at times of great stress and conflict.

'It must deliver the best possible outcome for all the children and families who use it, because its decisions directly affect the lives and futures of all those involved, and have repercussions for society as a whole.'
