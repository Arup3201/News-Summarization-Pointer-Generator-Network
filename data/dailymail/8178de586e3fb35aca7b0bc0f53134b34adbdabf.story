Children born in Atlanta, Detroit, Cleveland and Cincinnati are far less likely to pull themselves out of poverty than those whose parents earn the same amount of money in San Jose, San Francisco, Seattle and New York, a fascinating new study has shown.

Top economists at Harvard and University of California, Berkeley analyzed millions of anonymous earnings records to compare income mobility across metropolitan areas - and the results are surprising.

Living in an area with higher average incomes, larger tax credits for the poor or more local colleges does not necessarily improve the chances of someone rising beyond the station of their birth.

But four broad factors did appear to have an affect, researchers pointed out, and they included the size and dispersion of the local middle class.

The city where you live: The interesting study found the odds of rising to another income level are notably lower in certain cities, like Atlanta, and much higher in places like New York

If all else was equal, Americans living in cities with poor families more dispersed among mixed-income neighborhoods are more likely to climb the income ladder.

Children growing up in areas with more two-parent households, better elementary schools and high schools, and more civic engagement, including membership in religious and community groups, were also more able to pull themselves out of poverty and up the income scale.

'Where you grow up matters,' Nathaniel Hendren, a Harvard economist and one of the study’s authors, told The New York Times. 'There is tremendous variation across the U.S. in the extent to which kids can rise out of poverty.'

Where you lived matters less for well-off children than for middle-class and poor children, the researchers found. The chances that wealthy children grow up to be wealthy are broadly similar across all cities it appears.

Metropolitan areas with larger black 
populations had lower upward-mobility rates, but the researchers 
believed this was not primarily because of their race. For example, both
white and black residents of Atlanta have low upward mobility, The 
Times reported.

Interestingly
Atlanta and Seatle have a similar average income, yet the difference 
between upward mobility rates in the two cities are stark.

On
average, fairly poor children in Seattle — those who grew up in the 
25th percentile of the national income distribution — do as well 
financially when they grow up as middle-class children — those who grew 
up at the 50th percentile — from Atlanta, according to The Times.

Moving up the ladder: The study found children living in parts of California and the Northeast were far more likely to climb the income ladder than areas with the same average income in other parts of the country

Yet, children who moved from a city with poor rates of income mobility to a city with higher mobility rates at a young age were found to do almost as well at climbing the income ladder as kids who lived their whole lives in the latter region.

If they moved as teenagers, however, they did less well, suggesting the characteristics of different regions rather than something inherent and unchangeable in the residents is responsible.

The researchers pointed out that their data allowed them to identify only correlations not the causes for the intriguing patterns they discovered.
