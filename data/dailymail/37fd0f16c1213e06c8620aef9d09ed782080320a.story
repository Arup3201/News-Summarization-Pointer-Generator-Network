There is a lot more money to be made from the captaincy of a club as huge as Manchester United if the armband goes to a shooting star rather than a natural-born leader with an unselfishly over-riding perspective of the game.

Hence the agents of Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie have been doing everything in their power to press the claims of their respective clients.

Louis van Gaal beware. Since the Dutch tyrant does not like being told what to do by anyone – least of all we media hacks - he would be wise consult the evidence before bringing the curse of the celebrity skipper down upon Old Trafford.

Leading question: Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie are both in the running to captain Manchester United

Decisions, decisions: Louis van Gaal will have to choose his captain before the start of the season

VIDEO Rooney favourite for captaincy 

After all, he had a close-up view of the World Cup in Brazil.

Just to remind United’s new manager - the final was won by Germany under the concentrated leadership of defender Philipp Lahm, not Argentina while Lionel Messi was obsessing over his vain attempt to rediscover the form which used to make him the world’s best footballer. Had Javier Mascherano been Argentina’s captain he would have had the authority to tell dear little Leo to pull his finger out.

Just in case Van Gaal has forgotten, Van Persie was captain of his Dutch team which enjoyed a goal-spree in the group phase but then dried up as it stumbled into that dire semi-final against Argentina.

By way of further study, let me refer him to World Cups past.

Of the 19 winning skippers in the tournament’s history, only one can be categorised as a glamorous goalscorer. And that, my brother Englishmen, was an old friend of ours who just happens to be the greatest player ever to captain his country.

Diego Maradona raised his Hand of God to victory in Mexico 86.

But didn’t Pele captain the 1970 Brazilians who remain the best team of all time? Er, no, that would be Carlos Alberto.

So what about Zinedine Zidane for the only French glory in Paris 98? No, that was Didier Deschamps.

It was Dunga not Romaria and Cafu not Ronaldo for Brazil in 1994 and 2002….. Passarella not Kempes for Argentina 78…… Zoff not Rossi and Cannavaro not Del Piero or Totti for Italy in 1982 and 2006.

Captaincy in football may not seem as obviously important as in cricket and rugby but it is a serious business.

So serious that after Maradona probably the highest profile personalities to raise the World Cup aloft are the two greatest defenders of all time, men who were deeply perceptive readers of the game and who took leadership by example and inspiration very seriously indeed: Franz Beckenbauer and Bobby Moore.

The glitterati who have fallen short as captains at the very highest level is long and revealing.

As well as Messi and Van Persie it includes Johan Cruyff, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Cristiano Ronaldo now, Romania’s Gheorghe Hagi twice and the man who has cashed in most spectacularly on the armband… England’s very own David Beckham.

It is the mega-millions banked by Beckham which most excites the commercial representatives of Rooney and Van Persie.

Bryan Robson, United’s Captain Marvel, has been England’s best skipper since Moore but like this country’s only World Cup winner he reigned before the sponsorship, endorsement and advertising markets exploded.

Now there appears to be no limit to the fortunes achievable through the honour of captaining United.

Whether that will extend to winning trophies for the club is less certain.

Water carrier: The captain of France in 1998 wasn't the star Zinedine Zidane but Didier Deschamps (right)

Van Persie is a wonderful striker but he does not carry the bearing of a leader, so immersed is he in his own game. For Van Gaal to appoint his fellow Dutchman would smack of favouritism.

Rooney is United’s, as well as England’s, best player and a dynamic goalscorer in his own right. But while he does throw himself into the team effort he does so in a frenzied manner rather than with a deep understanding of the direction in which his endeavours might best be directed. And some at the club will never forget that he wanted to quit Old Trafford until United offered him even bigger bucks to stay.

Frankly, unhappy though both of them may well be if passed over, they would better left to get on with the job they do best – that of winning rather than controlling matches.

Strong captain: Nemanja Vidic was skipper at United until his departure for Inter Milan in the summer

The coming to such a conclusion is further complicated for Van Gaal by the current absence of a strong candidate for the captaincy.

Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand have gone from Old Trafford and others are about to follow. If Thomas Vermaelen, recently club captain without team portfolio at Arsenal, is brought in he could be one answer. If Darren Fletcher is fully fit, he should be a strong contender.

But how United must wish they, not their great Manchester rivals City, had bought Vincent Kompany – a captain by more than name if ever there was one.

Anderson should just let his bowling do the talking 

Times have changed since cricketers used to tell opposing batsmen they had just enjoyed group sex with their mothers and that their sisters were whores and it was all considered just part of the game.

Changed not least because the f-word and the c-word are now audible and visible on television.

Changed because cricketers are now higher-earning public figures than they used to be and with the money and fame comes responsibility.

Jumping for joy: Anderson leaps into the air as he enjoys taking the wicket of Virat Kohli

Changed because it is more important than ever to set an example to youngsters which rises above the gutter, not sinks into it.

So no, whatever the good old boys in the commentary box chunter on about, it was not acceptable for Jimmy Anderson to behave like a Borstal school-yard bully, even though he got off that misconduct charge.

Anderson has just proved to himself, by taking three wickets in the first innings demolition of his Indian protagonists, that he can be just as deadly with the ball without hurling foul-mouthed insults in its wake.

Hopefully the change in his behaviour is permanent – and we can all settle down to enjoy watching England win Test matches like this one.
