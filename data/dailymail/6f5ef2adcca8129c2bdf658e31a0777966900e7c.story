White House Senior Adviser Dan Pfeiffer said today he believes there's a 'possibility' that House Republicans will try to impeach the president.

The Huffington Post reports that Pfeiffer told attendees of a Christian Science Monitor breakfast that recent events, including the House's lawsuit against Obama, suggests the idea is not as far-fetched as it may seem.

'I think a lot of people in this town laugh that off,' Pfeiffer said. 'I
 would not discount that possibility.'

White House Senior Dan Pfeiffer, pictured here on Meet the Press in March, said today that he thinks House Republicans' lawsuit against the president could open the door to impeachment

'I think that Speaker [John] Boehner, by 
going down this path of this lawsuit, has opened the door to Republicans
 possibly considering impeachment at some point in the future,' he continued.

Citing former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin's calls for Congress to impeach the president and recent polls that show majority of Republicans agree with her, Pfeiffer concluded that the House may yet draw up articles of impeachment against the president.

'I think impeachment is a very serious thing that has been bandied 
about by the recent Republican vice presidential nominee and others in a
 very unserious way,' Pfeiffer said.

'And no one has even made any 
allegation of anything that would be within six universes from what is 
generally considered in that space.'

That said, Pfeiffer predicted that the president's plans to bypass Congress and unilaterally act on immigration could rankle Republicans enough to jump start the process.

'The president acting on immigration 
reform will certainly up the likelihood that they would contemplate 
impeachment,' he said, according to Reuters, adding it would be 'foolish' not to consider it a prospect.Â

A handful of Republicans on Capitol Hill have talked about impeaching the president such as retiring Rep. Steve Stockman, who sent his colleagues in Congress a book on 'The Case for Removing Barack Obama from Office' last fall. But no one in party leadership has even winked in the direction of impeachment.

Boehner has vehemently denied that the House's lawsuit is a gateway to impeachment. And a spokeman for Boehner characterized Pfeiffer's comments this morning as disingenuous.

'We have a humanitarian crisis at our border, and the White House is 
making matters worse with inattention and mixed signals,' Boehner aide Michael Steel told the Huffington Post, referring the more than 57,000 unaccompanied minors who have entered the country illegally since last October.

'It is telling, 
and sad, that a senior White House official is focused on political 
games, rather than helping these kids and securing the border,' Steel added.

This afternoon the president hopes to correct that during a meeting with Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina, Honduran President 
Juan Orlando Hernandez and El Salvadoran President Salvador Sanchez

The White House says the foreign leaders and Obama will discuss ways they can work together to make it clear to young people in their countries that his 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program does not apply to them.
