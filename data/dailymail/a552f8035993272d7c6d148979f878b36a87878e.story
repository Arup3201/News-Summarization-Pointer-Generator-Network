Tragic: Jeremy Brooke, 32, was on his dream trip to South Africa with friends when burglars burst into their farmhouse, shooting him in the neck and chest

A British adventurer has been shot dead in a bungled burglary during his dream trip to South Africa.

Jeremy Brooke, 32, was on holiday with friends in Transkei, a remote part of the country, when armed men burst into their farmhouse and opened fire.

Police said Jeremy, who was working as a farmer in the village, was shot in the chest and neck and died in hospital hours later.

Five men have been arrested in connection with the murder.

His heartbroken family in Bridgend, South Wales, said: 'We are devastated - Jeremy had a passion for life which enriched the lives of everyone who knew him.

'After leaving school he travelled extensively funding his trips and dreams through stints of working in factories and in farming.

'Jeremy attended Durban Prep School in South Africa before going on agricultural college where his passion for nature was further nurtured.

'Jeremy loved South Africa and it is regretful that such senseless and criminal violence is robbing the country of so many valuable, proud citizens.'

Jeremy, a nature warden, studied agriculture on a course for farmers' sons where he learned building, electrical, plumbing and welding skills.

His family said he was also a talented mechanic, stripping and rebuilding the engine of his dream car a Nissan 1400.

While at home in Bridgend he worked at the town's giant Sony factory and at a recycling plant.

The family spokesman said: 'They were all skills which stood him in good stead for the rest of his too short life.'

Jeremy was also a registered field guide, a PADI master diver, rescuer and instructor.

Last year his talents landed him a job on the set of a TV series in the Philippines.

Jeremy and friends were staying at a farmhouse in the South West of South Africa when the burglars burst in at midnight on February 21.

South Wales Police, who are supporting his family, said Jeremy was taken to Madawaleni hospital but pronounced dead shortly after.

The family spokesman said: 'Shocked as we are, we would like to express our gratitude for the support we have received.'

South African Police confirmed five men had been arrested in connection with the incident.

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national, Jeremy Brooke on 22 February in South Africa.

'We are providing consular assistance to his family at this difficult time.'
