Ronny Deila has admitted he would prefer to have Gary Mackay-Steven on board before the end of the month to boost Celtic’s title challenge.

The Parkhead boss confirmed he hopes the Dundee United winger will soon agree to a pre-contract that would initially secure a summer switch to Glasgow.

If that happens, then Deila is set to ask chief executive Peter Lawwell to try to strike a deal with United —who are thought to be seeking a £250,000 fee — that would bring forward the move.

‘That is the best situation but again it’s about money,’ said Deila. ‘First he has to say yes.

‘I think that’s the way you have to do it. If you don’t know if the players wants it then it’s harder to agree between the clubs.

‘When you have the opportunity, you go for the player and see what can be arranged.’

Sheffield United are also keen on Mackay-Steven and have seen a bid in the region of £100,000 rejected by the Tannadice outfit.

However, the 24-year-old isn’t thought to be keen on the prospect of playing in League One and that could leave Celtic in pole position unless higher-placed English opposition emerges.

Asked when he expected to speak with Mackay-Steven over the pre-contract, Deila added: ‘We will see, hopefully in a couple of days something will be arranged.

‘We have sent a letter to Dundee United saying we want to look at him. First of all we have to get him to sign and then we’ll take it from there.’

While Deila hopes to add Mackay-Steven, he remains adamant he doesn’t want to Kris Commons to depart.

Neil Lennon has stated that Bolton Wanderers were likely to face competition from other clubs in any move to lure Commons away during the current window.

Deila, however, insisted he wasn’t aware of any approaches and stressed that he expected the 31-year-old to see out the campaign with Celtic – regardless of his contract impasse.

‘We’ve had nothing from no-one and our process with Kris is going on,’ said Deila. ‘But he is going to stay until the end of the season.

‘It’s longer-term we have to think about with Kris because we are going to have him until the summer.

‘His focus looked good last Monday [against Kilmarnock] and if he keeps on like that, things are going to be good for both of us.’

Asked about the possibility of a fee for Commons being dangled before the club, Deila replied: ‘If it makes the team worse, then we won’t do it.

‘Again everything has a price and you never know in football, but we have to have a better squad on February 1 than we have right now.’
