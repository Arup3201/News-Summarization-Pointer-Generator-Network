Bobby Madley finished the weekend in line with the way his colleagues had started it, missing a red card for Tottenham’s Erik Lamela for a deliberate strike out at Jefferson Montero with an arm.

And another game, another diver — this time Harry Kane was the guilty party, deliberately simulating a foul for a penalty just before half-time.

Harry Kane goes down in the box in an attempt to try and win a penalty on Sunday

He stubbed his foot into the turf and went sprawling, looking for a spot-kick. Fortunately, Madley didn’t give the penalty but he failed to caution Kane as well.

In the 35th minute a foul on Wayne Routledge by Jan Vertonghen, for which the Belgian was cautioned, provoked players from both sides to surround Madley. 

It’s not the only time we saw this over the weekend and I hope we are not returning to scenes of mass protest, which have no place in the game.
