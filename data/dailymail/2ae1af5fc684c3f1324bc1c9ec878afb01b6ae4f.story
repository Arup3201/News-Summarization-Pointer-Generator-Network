Sportsmail's Graham Poll casts his eye over Saturday's controversial incidents in the Barclays Premier League - and there were plenty. 

Poor weekend

Mike Riley and his management team might want to check their appointments system as their inexperienced line-up left more questions than answers this weekend.

Perhaps the game of the day was given to Jon Moss, while Roger East and Craig Pawson were trusted with big games in London and clearly angered the managers with some of their decisions.

The more experienced referees in Andre Marriner and Martin Atkinson were given routine outings at Southampton and Newcastle respectively.

Also, isn’t it time the TV production companies educated their commentators to not mislead those watching?

The worst culprit this weekend was Jonathan Pearce, whose description of the Sunderland penalty appeal was embarrassingly inept.

Steven Fletcher had played the ball past Fraser Forster in the Southampton goal when the keeper clattered into the attacker.

Pearce thought the penalty wasn’t given as the ball had been played away – WRONG – and that had the penalty been given then Forster had to be dismissed – WRONG AGAIN.

The ball was in play, so the foul should have been given and Sunderland a lifeline at 0-2. However, as the ball was going wide an obvious goal scoring opportunity was not denied and Forster had to stay on the pitch.

Moss penalty fest

The match at the Etihad was remarkable due four penalties being awarded and only two were converted.

Penalty 1: This was the worst decision of them all. Frank Lampard threw himself to the ground at feeling the slightest of touches from Erik Lamela.

One could argue, as there was contact, technically the penalty award was not wrong but it was so soft it perhaps told us more about Lampard than Moss.

Penalty 2: The clearest of the four. Younes Kaboul completely wiped David Silva out and looked suitably embarrassed about his challenge.

Penalty 3: This was the most interesting. Watching Demichelis, you can see he trips Soldado when tracking him from behind.

His eyes give the foul away, which was correctly given, but was the contact inside the penalty area?

Replays clearly showed Martin Demichelis make contact with Roberto Soldado outside the box

Penalty 4: This time Moss was absolutely right to award a penalty, as Fazio clearly fouls Aguero to prevent his forward run on to a cross.

However, the red card was wrong as it is not clear Aguero would have met the cross or scored.

Pawson angering Warnock

Craig Pawson clearly upset Neil Warnock with his performance, but to be fair to Pawson pretty much every referee does that.

The issues started when Pawson, in keeping with current trends, chose not to caution Damien Delaney for his first tackle, a poor one which led to Chelsea’s first goal.

Then he let John Terry escape with a similarly poor tackle, but it was his first and so in keeping with his performance.

There can be no arguments about the red card issued to Cesar Azpilicueta for a shocking tackle, nor the first of Delaney’s yellow cards – he had been given his chance.

Then there was his second yellow card, technically correct and a really silly challenge which gave the Chelsea players the opportunity to pressurise the inexperienced Pawson into levelling things up – which he duly did.

To see Warnock grabbing his players at the final whistle to instruct them not to shake Pawson’s hand was disappointing but not surprising.

His childish antics and attitude to referees is par for the course unfortunately as age does nothing to mellow the angry manager.
