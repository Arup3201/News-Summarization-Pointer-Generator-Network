A young father-of-three drowned in the fishing lake of a caravan park after being pepper sprayed by police following an alcohol-fuelled late night confrontation with officers.

Leon Stent was a visitor at the Coghurst Hall Holiday Park in Hastings, East Sussex, when he argued first with staff and then with police after they were called when he allegedly became 'aggressive'.

Today one eye-witness told how the 30-year-old scaffolder got into difficulties in the water moments after entering the lake to escape from chasing police officers.

And another said he was running around as if trying to get the spray out of his eyes before entering the lake.

Lake: Scaffolder Mr Stent, 30, drowned in the lake at the holiday park outside Hastings at the weekend

One man, who did not want to be named but owns a holiday chalet overlooking the spot where Mr Stent died, said: 'One minute he was swimming on top of the lily pads and swearing at the 
police on the bank and then his body suddenly went stiff and he just 
dropped deep into the water.

'The
 spot where he died is full of weeds and he may have got tangled up with
 the lily pads which have eight foot stems which reach down to the 
bottom of the lake. I haven’t slept properly for three days after seeing
 him go under and die like that.'

When he entered the water, Mr Stent was wearing a dark coloured vest top and jeans which would have made swimming difficult.

Karen
 Baldwin, who lives at the park, said: ‘'After the police pepper sprayed
 him, he was running around, probably trying to get it out of his eyes. 
He ran into the water but they didn't follow him.

'One woman - I don't 
know if she knew him or not - tried to go in after him but they stopped 
her. She was trying to save him but they wouldn't let her go in.'

This afternoon,
 residents and visitors to the caravan park claimed that Mr Stent had 
spent much of the afternoon drinking before trying
 to buy more alcohol in the Clubhouse later in the evening.

'He
 tried to buy more booze over the bar and staff just refused to serve 
him,’ said one resident. 'He became louder and louder and more 
argumentative and in the end the police had to be called.'

Location: Mr Stent, from Hastings, was with friends at Coghurst Hall Holiday Park near the seaside town

Shortly after 11pm on Saturday night officers approached Mr Stent in a bid to pacify him. However, it was claimed by police that he then struck out at one of the officers before they decided to 'incapacitate' him by using pepper spray.

Mr Stent then ran away from officers towards the nearby lake which has clear signs advising that swimming is not allowed.

Having
 jumped into the water shortly after 11.20pm he tried to swim some 70 
metres to reach a small wooden jetty on the other side of the lake.

'Police
 and his friends were all shouting at him to come back to the shore but 
he was swearing at them,' said the eye-witness whose home is near the 
jetty.

'I
 was alerted that something was going on because I had three night 
fishing rods out on the lake and I heard the bite detector alarms going 
off. He must have touched the fishing lines as he swam.

'I
 was on my chalet balcony and saw him clearly on the lily pads for about
 thirty seconds and then he went limp and he was gone.'

According
 to residents police and firefighters searched for Mr Stent using lights
 and at least three boats until around 4am.

When the search was resumed on Sunday morning, a police dog on a small boat finally located his body at around 3pm.

One resident who witnessed the incident said: 'Everyone was out by the water watching what was going on.

'I sat on the bank with his father and brother on Sunday while they waited for the police to pull his body out.

'It was heartbreaking.'

Residents said the lake, which is full of large carp and is up to 20ft deep in places, was never used for swimming and was full of reeds.

Sussex
 police Chief Inspector Warren Franklin said: 'Officers and friends of 
the man encouraged him to come out of the water, but before he could do 
so he got into difficulties.

'Officers
 used boats to get onto the lake but could not find any trace of him. A 
large-scale search of the lake was launched by officers with other 
members of the emergency services as well as the surrounding area.'

Yesterday, members of Mr Stent’s family visited the park and lake where they threw flowers into the water in his memory.

Mr Stent’s mother, Pam, was said by a family member to be ‘too 
distraught’ to talk about her son at her home in Hastings today.

Drinkers at the Paddy McGinty’s pub he frequented in the town spoke of a 'nice family man who was not one to take risks.'

'He
 was one of the lads really', said one associate who would not be 
named.  'He was like anyone of his age – he liked a drink over the 
weekend when he had money . He had been with his partner on and off 
since they were at school together.'

Park
 Holidays UK, the owners of Coghurst Hall Holiday Park, said it would be
 giving ‘every assistance possible to police investigating the 
circumstances of the incident.'

Due
 to police being in contact with Mr Stent immediately before his death 
the Independent Police Complaints Commission has been informed of the 
incident.
