Freedom: Killer Matthew Richardson, who now goes by the name of Maxine, pictured on weekend release from prison

A killer who stabbed to death a prostitute who mocked his performance as a male kissogram has been spotted enjoying a temporary release from prison - as a woman.

Matthew Richardson, 55, who was jailed for life in 1986 for murdering 65-year-old prostitute Margaret Bolingbroke, has been undergoing female hormone replacement treatment while behind bars.

Richardson, who is now known as Maxine, was spotted boarding a London-bound train while on weekend release with long blonde hair and pink lipstick and wearing a fur-lined hat and leather jacket on Friday.

The killer was one of a group of prisoners dropped off by a minibus at a station close to Blantyre House in Goudhurst, Kent.

One onlooker told the Sunday Mirror: 'He looked happy to be out of prison and was very relaxed.

'Although he was wrapped up because of the cold he stood out of the crowd because of the blonde hair and lipstick.

'People walking past were doing a double take, especially when they heard his voice.'

Richardson made headlines in 2011 when it was revealed that he was to have a Â£45,000 sex change operation on the NHS.

The news angered the Taxpayers' Alliance back then who called it 'unfair that law-abiding patients face a postcode lottery for care.'

But prisoners are entitled to the same range of NHS treatments, including those for gender reassignment, as non-offenders.

He was seen dressed in woman's clothes at the time while helping out at a charity shop in Maidstone, Kent as part of his rehabilitation.

Richardson is yet to have the operation, according to the Sunday Mirror.

Although Blantyne House is classed as a mens' prison, Government guidelines brought in in 2011 decreed that jails must allow inmates who wish to undergo a sex change to live in their acquired gender.

The prisoner was initially jailed in 1986 but tried to appeal his conviction in 1991.

Though it was initially quashed, a retrial found him guilty again and he was sent back to jail in 1992.

He is due for permanent release from jail this week.
