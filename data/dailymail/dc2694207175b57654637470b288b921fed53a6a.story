Real Madrid fans are used to seeing the dazzling skills of Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale, but manager Carlo Ancelotti has proved he is no slouch either.

The 55-year-old – who played 26 times for Italy during his career – completed 73 keepy-uppys in a row as his players warmed up before Real’s Champions League clash with Ludogorets on Wednesday.

The former AC Milan and Roma midfielder looked calm and composed throughout as he showed off his ball skills in training before the Champions League clash.

His team on the other hand have looked far from that this season, although Madrid won their last game 2-1 against the Bulgarian outfit.

Overall their form this season hasn’t been perfect though, with the club losing twice in La Liga to Real Sociedad and reigning champions Atletico Madrid.

Ancelotti has a wealth of options to call upon as Real seek to defend their Champions League title and win La Liga for the first time since 2012.

However, should such form continue or if they suffer an injury crisis then maybe he will have to play himself.

Ancelotti also played for fellow Italian side Roma during his professional career in the game
