The family of Misty Upham have said they were forced to set up their own search party when the Django Unchained actress went missing after police 'did not help the investigation'.

Relatives, who have gathered together in Auburn, Washington, to grieve also believe the 32-year-old could have been found alive if police had 'taken their concerns seriously'. 

It follows claims from her August: Osage County co-star Juliette Lewis that the 32-year-old Native American told her she 'feared she was being targeted' while others believe her death was as a result of 'foul play'.

Tragedy: The dead body of Misty Upham, 32, who was missing since October 5, was found on Thursday

Frustration: Her family (Charles her father pictured left) claim they had to set up their own search party because the police 'did not help the investigation'

Despair: Her father posted on Facebook saying that law enforcement was not looking for his daughter

A spokesman for the family released a statement on Friday evening saying: 'The family wants to make it clear the Auburn police did not help in the investigation or the finding of Misty at all. It was her uncle, Roberth Upham, who organized the search party that found Misty. 

'The family is concerned that if the police had actually taken their concerns seriously within those first few hours of the report that perhaps she would have been found.'

'We are now just waiting on the coroner's report.'

Asked if family and friends could trust the coroner's report, she responded: 'The family has concerns. We are waiting to hear what is stated in the coroner's report but there is a long history of police harassment between the Auburn police and the native community. 

'There's a lot of distrust. And that's founded in the historical trauma experienced by the native community at the hands of the police. 

'And you know, Misty has also experienced harassment at the hands of police so you know, the family is concerned about the circumstances surrounding what happened and why police chose not look for Misty.'

Tribute: Juliette Lewis posted a picture on Instagram with Misty saying she fought for the voiceless fiercely

Calling for action: She warned Misty feared 'she could be murdered' and had suffered horrible violence 

'The family stated they do not feel she committed suicide. The family has stated that her death is most likely an accident. 

'And they've also stated that they feel ais if their concerns weren't listed to, and when they pleaded for help this perhaps could have been prevented and her body could have been found in time after she fell.'

Others close to the family of the Native American have said she could have been a victim of 'foul play'.

A source, who would only call himself Harry, told Mail Online he believes the police in Auburn, Washington are 'derelict' in their duty after she went missing for 12 days.

'She had her purse with her and because she had her purse and phone the police thought she left of her own will,' he said. 'Her uncle found her, not police, and her purse was near the cliff where she fell to her death.'  

He added the family was certain she fell or else was the subject of 'foul play'.

A spokesman for the Muckleshoot reservation did not immediately comment on Misty's death or allegations city police did not do enough to look for her.

Upham, 32, a Native American actress praised for her roles in movies including August: Osage County, Frozen River and Django Unchained, was missing for 12 days before police found her body at the bottom of a wooded embankment in Auburn, Washington.

Officers have declared there is 'no evidence of foul play' as they continue to investigate the death.

But today Juliette Lewis took to Twitter blasting the task force's announcement, warning: 'police must do an investigation'.

She tweeted about her August: Osage County co-star: '#RIPMistyUpham I am in shock and greif [sic]. I pray the police do a murder investigation. They're saying not 'foul play' when ofcourse it is.

'Misty spoke out alot against injustices within Native community. And had known enemies. Police must do an investigation.'

She then retweeted a series of Upham's own tweets, including a warning for people to 'walk on egg shells' because she had 'just been followed by Indian Trader'.   

Later, Lewis added: 'I cant sleep. Too much darkness. I feel so sad about Misty. I know she has more to say. And about how she died.

'Misty told me about horrible violence she suffered on NA reservations She felt she coul be murdered! Bcuz she was vocal #ThisIsNOTaSUICIDE '.

Upham's family has also blasted claims of a suicide, claiming she fell to her death.

Close relatives of the 32-year-old star told TMZ she was in 'a reflective mood' when she went to the scenic wooded embankment where her body was found and accidentally fell off a cliff. Her shoes and purse were found at the top of the cliff.

They insist she had been talking about moving back to LA.

Upham had recently returned to the Seattle-area to help care for her father, Charles Upham, who suffered a stroke last year.

Last night, it was Mr Upham who had to identify the lifeless body of his own daughter. 

Shortly after her disappearance, Upham told KIRO-FM that his daughter was upset and erratic and had stopped taking medication for anxiety and bipolar disorder.

Auburn police had responded to a suicide call at Misty Upham's residence in the days before she was last seen, authorities said.

Her father previously said he did not believe she was suicidal. 

Lewis reiterated his sentiment by posting a picture of herself and Misty on Instagram with the caption: 'Misty Upham survived many things that many don't early on in life. She fought for the voiceless feircely [sic].

'She understood suffering and the deepest pain. She had a presence everyone saw and felt. It is this presence that will continue. 

'Out of the dark space in which her light got dimmed. I will remember her as tuff [sic]. Wise. Funny. Spiritual. And hopeful. 

'This is another great reminder to call and check on someone when you think to. Not when its too late. RIPMistyUpham' 

It took just over five hours to identify the body.

The Hollywood Reporter spoke with Seattle-based filmmaker Tracy Rector who said that Misty Upham's uncle, Robert Upham, organized a search party to look for the missing actress three days ago.

Missing: Upham's parents had been canvassing their town and hanging 'missing' posters for 12 days

'We waited at the site where the team found the body,' Rector told The Hollywood Reporter.

'It took about five-and-a-half hours to confirm. Then we gathered around her body to say prayers and now we're all gathered at the church.'

Mr Upham told the MailOnline late Wednesday that he was frantic to find his daughter and felt that media attention had focused on her glamorous days on the red carpet and not her as a 'normal person.'

He said the actress, a member of the Blackfoot tribe, had cut off her long locks before she went missing.

He denied his daughter would ever go through with a suicide.

He told KIRO-FM that Misty was in a 'psychotic' state when she left her house with only the clothes on her back and without her medication.

'It wasn't like she just decided to take time off,' he said.

He added: 'She has said suicidal things in the past but never followed through,' he said. 

'She doesn't believe in killing herself. She believes that is a sin and she would never do that.'

Speaking to HollywoodLife.com, Mona Upham, Misty's mother, accused the Seattle area police of not doing enough to find her daughter.

She attributed it to her Native-American background. 'I think if Misty was different-looking they would be doing a lot more to help find her,' she said.

This was not the first time Upham has reportedly left her home without notice, and it is also not the first time police have responded to suicide calls at her residence.

People magazine reported that in the last year, police have responded to Upham's apartment four times following suicide calls.

Upham may have been under a lot of stress prior to her death. 

Movies: Upham recently played a house keeper in 'August: Osage County' which starred Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts. But she had won an award for her role in the 2008 independent film 'Frozen River'

A source reportedly told People that Upham was struggling financially and sometimes had trouble paying her rent.

Police received a suicide call on October 5, but when officers arrived, she was no longer at her father's house.

A day later, her father went to the police asking that his daughter be listed as a 'missing and endangered person.'

The police did not comply, saying that Upham's case did not meet the criteria because her disappearance was not 'unexplainable, involuntary or suspicious,' according to USA Today.

Therefore, the Upham family took to Facebook and local media to alert the public about their missing daughter and to enlist the public's help in finding her.

In a Facebook post on Upham's page, the family stated: 'We have been consumed by chasing down leads and doing ground searches in the area she was last seen. It is only her family searching right now, hanging posters, checking with shelters, hospitals, and asking people in the area if she has been seen.

Upham is best known for her role in the 2008 independent film 'Frozen River,' for which she received an Independent Spirit Award nomination. She recently played a house keeper in 'August: Osage County.' Her next onscreen role will be in 'Cake' with Jennifer Aniston and Anna Kendrick.
