Joshua Bonehill-Paine used his website to attack five victims and made false allegations about them

A former public schoolboy who described himself as a 'rising star of the right-wing community' and branded innocent people as paedophiles online has escaped a prison sentence.

Joshua Mark Bonehill-Paine attacked five different victims by cloning their Facebook accounts, publishing 'wanted' posters and creating false allegations about them and posting them online.

The 22-year-old, from Yeovil in Somerset, claimed people were paedophiles, homosexuals and held certain religious views - causing one of the victims to lose their business.

Most of the abuse took place on his politically-motivated website, which he founded in 2013 to report 'on the truth to the interest of our readers and those who believe in nationalist change.'

He was found guilty of six counts of malicious communication and handed a three month prison sentence, suspended for 18-months, when he appeared at Yeovil Magistrates Court on Monday.

He reportedly spent the morning smirking in the dock and speaking outside the court said he had 'absolutely no remorse for them [the victims] whatsoever'.

'Well of course I have to [stay away from them] because I have been issued with a restraining order.' 

One of his victims, Richard Day, said how the abuse meant that he was unable to go outside and his business fell apart.

He said: 'I noticed this chap bullying. They asked me to go and report him in court, hopefully being sentenced last Spring. He wasn't.

'He then put up a picture of me, and I am fairly distinctive, as a paedophile. He knows nothing about me. My business went under.

'For quite a long time I didn't really go outside except for necessities because it only takes on idiot looking through the internet to see that, perhaps a bit drunk or drugged up, and to stumble outside and see me, and not everybody looks like me, and I am dead in the gutter.'

Last year, Bonehill-Paine received a community order for an internet hoax about a Leicester pub barring military personnel, forcing it to close. 

Richard Day was one of the victims and says that Bonehill-Paine falsely claimed he was a paedophile, which resulted in Day losing his business

 In 2011, when he was still an 18-year-old student, Bonehill-Paine was convicted of stealing uniforms from a police station.

He told a court he broke into the building and took the outfit, including body armour, baton and handcuffs, to keep warm after he was thrown out of his hotel.  

He used his Conservative Party membership card to flick the lock at Chard Police Station, in Somerset, and chanted 'your security is s***' when police tried to arrest him. 

Magistrates sentenced Bonehill-Paine to a 12-month community order - including 100 hours of unpaid work and supervision by the probation service - after admitting burglary and assault.
