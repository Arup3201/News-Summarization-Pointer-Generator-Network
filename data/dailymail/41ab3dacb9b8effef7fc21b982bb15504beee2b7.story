A mortgage broker who gave up her high-flying job to chase her dream of becoming a professional surfer says she's never been happier.

Jessie Tuckman, originally from Macclesfield, Cheshire, was living in a luxury city centre flat and working as a loan and mortgage broker in Manchester.

But, in 2012, the adrenaline junkie gave up the lot and moved more than 300 miles away to Cornwall with just £150 to her name to chase her dream of becoming a top flight surfer.

And the 26-year-old - who hadn't even touched a surf board until she was 20 - now spends up to eight hours every day surfing off the coast of Newquay.

Speaking about making the change, Jessie said: 'It got to the point where I was still working my nine to five job - but I was spending a lot of money to travel to different parts of the UK every weekend so I could surf.

Jessie, pictured before she swapped the city for the surf, said it got to the point where she was still working a nine to five job but was spending a lot of money to travel to different parts of the UK every weekend so she could surf

Jessie says that a lot of the girls on the surf scene have been surfing since they were just six or seven years old and they have earned their reputation

Now, Jessie has her sights set on breaking into the top 10 when the season starts in May

Jessie said that moving down South was a bit of a shock to the system at first but, she says, life isn't all about money and she's happier now

'I was improving and becoming more dedicated and I knew that if I wanted to do it properly I needed to be in the sea everyday.

'When I told my family they did think I was a bit mad but they just wanted me to be happy and were really supportive.

'People think I just gave up my really well paid job to lie on the beach and work as a cleaner - they think I'm crazy - but they don't realise how hard I work.

'When I first moved down I lived in a hostel - I had left my city centre flat and was living in a room with six bunk beds and eating pot noodles using the hot tap and no kettle.

'It was a bit of a shock to the system at first - but life isn't all about money and I know I will probably never be rich, but I am happy.'

The competition season runs from May to November and Jessie competes at least once a month

Jessie might have only been surfing for six years but she has already risen through the ranks and came in at 13th in the UK last year.

But the surfer - who lives with fiance Tom - has her sights set on breaking into the top 10 when the season starts in May.

And Jessie has picked up a part-time cleaning job with her sponsor The Stable, which means she is finished by 9am every morning and has the entire day to ride the waves.

She said: 'I surf every day and I have a personal trainer who trains me in the gym to make sure I am fit.

'The competition season runs from May to November and I compete at least once a month, as often as I possibly can.

Speaking about her favourite pasttime, Jessie says the sport gives her an adrenaline rush

'A lot of the girls on the surf scene have been surfing since they were just six or seven years old and they have earned their reputation.

'But when I started competing in 2012 I was 23, which made me quite old.

'Sometimes I have to remember the others have been doing it much longer - but I think it shows how hard I work.

'I have taken a judging course to help me better understand the scoring system and it is something I might like to pursue in the future.

'I definitely couldn't go back to sitting at a desk in an office now - I love surfing. It is definitely an adrenaline rush, but it can also be quite calming and relaxing.'

She surfs every day and also has a personal trainer who trains her in the gym to make sure she is fit
