A schoolboy died from major internal injuries after falling off a bike while speeding down a hill as he played with friends after school, an inquest heard today.

Peter Mills-Coles, eight, was sent flying when he lent over to steer around a corner and his right pedal hit the ground on a residential street in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire.

Both he and the bike were sent flying into the air, colliding either before or after Peter hit the ground, causing him severe internal injuries.

Peter was rushed to hospital in Barnet but doctors were unable to save him and he died after the accident on May 19.

He had been playing with a group of friends after school when the freak accident occurred, the inquest at Hatfield Coroner's Court heard.

The boy was taking a turn on a friend’s bike and had gone off for a ride around the block, as his friends had before him, but had not returned.

One man living nearby had been in his garden when he heard a 'loud thump'  and went out to the road to investigate.

'He saw Peter lying on the grass verge on his side,' said coroner Edward Thomas.

'The bike was on its side next to a tree by next door’s garden.' 

Fast: Peter had been coming down this hill when he fell off his bike after trying to go around the bend

Play: Peter and his friends had taken it in turns to ride around the block, and he was taking this right-hand bend when he crashed

Police constable Robert Wagstaff, a collision investigator, told the hearing that while the bike was a 'bit scruffy', the brakes, steering and wheels were all in good working order.

There were no potholes or any problems with the road surface where Peter fell off the bike and no other vehicles were involved.

Pc Wagstaff said: 'Where he fell there was a decline and there’s a right-hand bend that he tried to negotiate.

'The right pedal is down, that’s made contact with the ground and the bike and rider were launched.'

The speed Peter was riding at meant he would have had to lean quite far over to get around the bend, PC Wagstaff added. 

Results from a post-mortem examination showed Peter had suffered massive internal bleeding from a liver laceration.

Neighbours had looked after Peter until ambulance staff arrived at around 5.30pm to take him to hospital.

Mr Thomas said he was really impressed with the responses from passers-by.

'I think the feeling of a lot of people was that they wished they could have done more,' he said.

'I really want to reassure them that they did everything right - there was nothing more they could have done.'

Peter was a year three pupil at Summerswood Primary School in Borehamwood.

His school released a tribute, saying: 'Peter is much loved and will always be remembered by all his friends and everyone at Summerswood.

'He was a popular member of his class and was always recognisable by his cheeky smile.

His parents Christopher and Angela were not at today's hearing.

Mr Thomas added: 'I just felt so very sad for Peter.

'I think all of us remember as children riding our bikes. I remember falling off my bike.

'They were just having such a nice time, just having a little spin around and just a slight misjudgement down quite a steep hill with the pedal, and that’s the jolt.

'No other vehicles had any bearing on this at all.

'I’m going to record that Peter died an accidental death and that concludes the investigation into this awful tragedy.'

Speaking to the family liaison officer representing Peter’s family, Mr Thomas said: 'Can you please pass on how sorry we all were?

'What a nice young boy he was. Poor Peter.'
