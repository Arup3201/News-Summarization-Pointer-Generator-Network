Snow, sleet and blizzards have hit parts of the UK which could see areas of Britain wake up to a blanket of snow on Saturday morning. 

An 'area of rain, sleet and snow' is moving east across Northern Ireland, Wales, central and northern England and Scotland, forecasters said.

Snow has forced Liverpool's John Lennon Airport to close. Planes from Malta, Berlin and Bucharest were sent to Manchester, while one from the Isle of Man had to turn back.

A spokesman for the airport said: 'We are clearing the runway. We have had quite a deluge.'

'We recommend you contact your airline or tour operator and check the status of your flight before arriving at the airport.' 

Elsewhere, passengers on board a flight to Hamburg said there were stuck at Manchester Airport for more than three hours because of snow. 

According to reports, the flight was delayed because it needed to be 'de-iced' by a special vehicle at the airport.  

Tonight, snow fell across Derbyshire, with severe weather leaving hundreds of people without electricity. Some 1,824 homes were hit by a power cut in the Ashbourne area of the Derbyshire Dales.

Although power was restored to many, Western Power Distribution said staff were struggling to get to customers because of snow and bad weather.

Today, the Met Office upgraded its cold weather alert to Level 3 Amber - one below a national emergency - saying there was a 90 per cent chance of severe cold, ice or snow in parts of England in the run up to New Year's Eve.

Temperatures could also drop as low as -10C in some places at the start of next week.

A spokeswoman said: 'Low pressure, tracking southeastwards over central and southern England later Boxing Day and overnight into Saturday, is expected to give a period of sleet and snow across the Midlands, some northern parts of East Anglia and southern parts of both NW England and Yorks and Humberside.

'Some significant snow accumulations are possible, especially on higher ground. Strong winds will develop in places for a time, exacerbating the chill.

'As the low clears away southeastwards, cold air will move south across the whole of England giving a risk of wintry showers and icy conditions across England for the rest of Saturday.'

After a warmer than average Christmas Day yesterday, a thick frost was on the ground this morning and temperatures will continue to drop

A huge band of rain, sleet and snow is moving in from the Atlantic and will move across the whole of England and southern Scotland today. An area including Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, the Midlands, East Anglia, the North West, Yorkshire and as far south east as London and Kent has been put on a separate yellow alert for snow by the Met Office

 

Krista Mitchell, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said: 'This year as a whole has been very mild, so this could be the coldest spell that we've had.

'As we go towards Monday and Tuesday, we will see overnight temperatures really drop, with widespread frost and most places dropping below freezing.'

The NHS and local councils have been put on alert and Public Health England have urged people to check on elderly neighbours.

The authority's Dr Angie Bone said: 'We encourage people to keep an eye on the forecast and take the weather into account when planning activities over the following days.

'We also advise people to keep active in the home, have plenty of warm food and drinks, and maintain indoor temperatures to at least 18°C, particularly the older or very young, people with pre-existing health conditions, or who are not very mobile. These groups can be particularly vulnerable to the ill-effects of cold.'

She added: 'Also take some time to think about how the bad weather may affect your friends, family and neighbours: it's important we all do what we can to protect those around us.

'If you do need to go out, remember to wear lots of thin layers and shoes with a good, slip-resistant grip to prevent any accidental falls.'

Rain, sleet and snow may also affect south west Scotland and the Strathclyde and Lothian and Borders, forecasters said.
