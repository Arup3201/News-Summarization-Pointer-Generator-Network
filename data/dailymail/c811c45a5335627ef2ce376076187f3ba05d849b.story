Chinese authorities have successfully moved a 12,000 ton, six-storey building just 38 metres.

Developers needed the space as part of a 'face-lift' of the area, but they did not want to lose the Zhengguanghe Building in Shanghai which has become a local landmark. 

So they hatched a plan to move the red-bricked building to the edge of the block.

Face lift: As part of a 'face-lift' of the area, developers decided to save the six-storey red brick Zhengguanghe Building in Shanghai

Moving a structure as large as the building had never been attempted before in the city and it was projected to take 20 days.

Shifting the 12,000 ton structure required the use of 12 lifting jacks, each capable of lifting 200 tons, on the eastern side of the building.

This was supported by a further 16 on the southern side.

Popular landmark: The building was designed by British architect George Wilson and was completed in 1935

The building was designed by British architect George Wilson and was completed in 1935.

It has always been one of the historic landmarks of the city due to its strong British architecture style.

It was originally used as the warehouse of the Zhengguanghe soda factory, but was named a valuable historical building in 1999. 

The foundations will be reinforced to ensure it stands the test of time. 

In 2012 a 122-year-old, 6,200 ton building in Zurich was moved 60 metres to make way for the expansion of a nearby railway.

The Guinness Book of Records states: 'The heaviest building moved intact is the Fu Gang Building at West Bank Road Wuzhou, in the Guangxi Province of China.

'It was successfully relocated by the Guangzhou Luban Corporation on 10 November 2004.The building weighs 15,140.4 metric tonnes (33.3 million lb) and is 34 m (111 ft) tall.

'The building was moved 35.62 metres horizontally and it took eleven days to complete the relocation at a speed of around 30 centimetres an hour.'

Checks: A workman checks the structure as the move is underway

Reinforced: The foundations will be reinforced, to ensure it stands the test of time
