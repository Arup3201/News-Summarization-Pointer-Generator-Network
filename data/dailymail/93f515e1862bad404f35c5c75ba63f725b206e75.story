John Coleman has wasted no time making his first signing for Accrington Stanley after snapping up Blackburn's Republic of Ireland under-21 midfielder John O'Sullivan on loan. 

Coleman was only reappointed for a second spell in charge of Stanley on Thursday but will confirm in the next 24 hours that a month-long deal has been agreed for 21-year old O'Sullivan, who played under the Stanley boss during a loan spell at Southport. 

The Irish youngster signed his first professional contract at Ewood Park in 2013.

O'Sullivan, 21, made his professional debut on the final day of the 2012/13 season against Birmingham. 

He made 21 appearances for Conference Premier outfit Southport in the second half of last season. 

Coleman took the reins for his second spell at Accrington after the club parted company with James Beattie by mutual consent last week.

The Liverpudlian had a hugely successful from 1999 to 2012, taking Stanley back to the Football League before standing down to take charge of Rochdale.
