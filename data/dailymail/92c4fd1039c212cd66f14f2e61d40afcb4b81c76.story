Theatre, TV and film actor Sir Donald Sinden has died aged 90 after years battling cancer.

Sir Donald made his name on stage as a Shakespearean actor and also had more than 70 credits for film and TV productions since the late 1940s to now.

He had been battling prostate cancer over several years and his death, just weeks before his 91st birthday, at his home in Romney Marsh, Kent, has been described as a 'huge loss' by his family.

His son, actor and film director Marc Sinden, said in a statement: 'My father has finished dying. He suffered for a few years from prostate cancer which slowly spread.

'Even though his death was expected, it is still a huge loss to his family and we, his brother, his son, his four grandchildren and great-grandchild will all miss his humour and knowledge and we would all like to share our appreciation for the Pilgrims Hospice and the carers that looked after him and us with such dignity, consideration and care until the end.'

Sir Donald trained at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Arts in London and made his film debut in 1953 with The Cruel Sea, later going on to perform with the Royal Shakespeare Company in leading roles such as King Lear and Malvolio in Twelfth Night.

But for all his classical roles and theatrical prowess, many will remember him for TV sitcoms such as Two's Company and Never The Twain, as well as a running spoof in satirical puppet show Spitting Image which poked fun at his wonderfully rich voice.

The actor was born in Plymouth on 9 October, 1923, the son of a country chemist. He had fully intended to pursue a career as an architect and surveyor.

However, he was spotted in an amateur theatrical production in the Brighton Little Theatre and in 1942 was asked to join the Charles F Smith Company, which entertained the troops. Sir Donald had himself been turned down for naval service because of asthma.

After brief training in a drama school, he quickly established himself as a stage performer, particularly in Shakespearean roles.

He joined the Shakespearean Memorial Theatre Company in the 1940s and in the 1960s he became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), starring in their productions of King Lear and Othello. 

The star, pictured last year left and right in 1975, was born in Plymouth, and started his career on the stage in roles such as King Lear before finding further fame on TV and film

For some years he alternated between the RSC and modern comedy, making his screen debut in the film classic, The Cruel Sea in 1953 as naval officer Lockhart, and thereafter became a suave leading man in British films during the rest of that decade.

He also starred in screen hits Doctor In The House and Doctor at Large.

As his film appearances became less frequent, Sir Donald worked steadily in the theatre, primarily with the RSC.

In 1970, he played Sir William Harcourt Courtly in the RSC's revival of Dion Boucicault's London Assurance.

He also appeared in Terence Rattigan's double bill, In Praise Of Love (1973) and as Dr Stockman in Henrik Ibsen's An Enemy Of The People at Chichester in 1975. In 1982 he starred in Anton Chekhov's Uncle Vanya, while in 1990, he gave a solo appearance as Oscar Wilde.

Sir Donald was also a regular on the small screen.

In the 1970s, he appeared as an unflappable English butler alongside U.S. actress Elaine Stritch, who died earlier this year, playing a brash American, in the TV series Two's Company.

And he played for further laughs alongside Windsor Davies in Never The Twain, playing neighbours and business rivals who despised each other but found themselves tied by family when their children married.

The programme was a mainstay of ITV schedules and ran for 11 series.

Sir Donald also played Sir Joseph Channing, a senior appeal court judge in the popular BBC series Judge John Deed.

His other TV credits include The Canterville Ghost (1997), The Treasure Seekers (1996), All's Well That End's Well (1981), as well as a memorable guest-starring turn in the cult 1960s drama The Prisoner.

He appeared, too, in numerous radio productions and guested on TV shows such as Blankety Blank and Open House, as well as providing the instantly recognisable voice-overs for many TV commercials.

In his later years, Sir Donald appeared in a brief cameo role in the 2012 film Run For Your Wife, adapted from the popular theatrical farce, which was a box office flop.

In 1948, he married Diana Mahony who died a decade ago. They had two sons, one of whom Jeremy - also an actor – tragically died from lung cancer in 1996, while the other, Marc, is a director and producer.

He was awarded a CBE in 1979 and was granted a knighthood in 1997 for his services to drama.

His son Marc, who has his own production company, added: 'He bravely continued presenting our Sky Arts documentary series Great West End Theatres in spite of a minor stroke, until it became just too difficult for him and at his insistence his illness was kept from all but the closest friends.

'It had been an ambition of his to get as many of his wonderful theatrical memories and anecdotes down on film to share with people, in and outside of our profession, who may have never heard his extraordinary tales of a hugely long career.

Sir Donald Sinden enjoys a chat with the Duke of Edinburgh in February 2012, when he was already unwell

'Not many knew, for instance, that he was the last person living to have known Oscar Wilde's lover Lord Alfred Douglas (Bosie) and was one of only two people to attend his funeral.

'The breadth of his friendships, his love of serendipity and his hugely varied and very successful career as a Rank Organisation movie star, West End and television star and award-laden Shakespearean actor was probably unique in our business.

'He worked out that he only had a total of five weeks unemployment between 1942 and 2008, which was probably a record in itself. Another record he held from 1949 until 2013 was at the Haymarket Theatre in his beloved West End of London, where he gave more consecutive performances in one play than any other actor since it was built in 1820.

Mr Sinden said plans for a memorial service were under way.

'We hope that you will respect our feelings at this miserable time and grant us the privacy we would like. The venue and date for a memorial service will be announced later,' he said.

Sir Roger Moore was among those paying tribute on Twitter, calling him 'a wonderful actor'. The two worked together on 1975 film That Lucky Touch.

‘Sad to wake up to news another mate has left us,’ the former James Bond star said. ‘Awful week.’

And comedian Miranda Hart wrote: ‘Another loss. Sir Donald Sinden. I like to think his beyond wonderful voice is dramatically booming around a heavenly realm.’

Magician Paul Daniels also paid tribute, saying the actor was ‘a truly nice gentleman with a wonderful sense of humour.’
