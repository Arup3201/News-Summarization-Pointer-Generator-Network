House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer awkwardly told a room full of Africans yesterday that he doesn't actually 'whip' his colleagues.

In an attempt to make a joke about his job title at the top of his remarks Wednesday at a U.S.- Africa Leaders Summit event Hoyer, a Democrat, said: 'First of all, let me tell my friends from Africa, I do not whip people!

'And if you’ve watched House of Cards, it is not accurate!' he added.

In the political thriller House of Cards the main character, Frank Underwood, serves as the Democratic Whip in the House of Representatives before scheming his way into the Vice Presidency.

Both Republicans and Democrats in the House have whips who are elected by members of their party at the start of every legislative session. The whip's job is to convince colleagues on his or her side of the aisle to vote for legislation backed by party leadership.

The whip is the second highest ranking member of the party that is not in power and the third highest ranking member of the party that controls the House after the Speaker and the Majority Leader.

While there's no doubt Hoyer's audience understood his joke about being his party's whip, attendees were likely not as familiar with the plot line of House of Cards, as the show is only available on internet streaming website Netflix.

As the Daily Caller pointed out, relatively few Africans have working electricity - let alone broadband internet - a fact that Hoyer pointed out in his speech.

'Right now, there are 600 million sub-Saharan Africans living without reliable access to electricity.  That’s 70% of the population – and a significant barrier to growing Africa’s middle class,' Hoyer stated.

As a result, the U.S. has been coordinating public and private investments into a program called Power Africa which benefits Ethiopia, Ghana, Liberia, Kenya, Nigeria, and Tanzania, he explained.

Yesterday marked the final day of the White House's first-ever summit with African leaders. The theme of the three day conference was 'Investing in the Next Generation.'

The event Hoyer spoke at was a side event organized by the Congressional Black Caucus.
