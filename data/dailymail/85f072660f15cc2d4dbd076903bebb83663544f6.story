Sexual assault charges for a man who allegedly slept with an underage student before marrying her  have been thrown out.

KHOU reported the charges against teacher Illich Guardiola, 41, were thrown out on Wednesday. 

The Houston man and his young student were first spotted together by police this spring, according to the affiliate station.

Case:  The charges for Illich Guardiola, who reportedly slept with and married a 16-year-old female student, have been thrown out 

The 16-year-old revealed to authorities she and her teacher 'were in love,' KHOU said.

In late April, Guardiola married his student in Las Vegas in front of her mother - and both women have not cooperated with investigators, the affiliate station said.

16-year-olds can get married in Texas and Nevada if a parent or guardian consents to the marriage. 

The girl also texted 'I love having sex with you' to Guardiola before his May arrest in Spring Valley, Click2Houston reported. 

MailOnline previously reported that Guardiola taught at Houston Family Arts Center, and has also voiced anime characters on 'Area 88, 'One Piece,' and 'Air Gear.'

Both Guardiola and the girl appeared in 'Freckleface Strawberry' this spring, MailOnline reported.

In May, Houston Family Arts Center spokesman Bob Clark said Guardiola had been let go. 

'We were informed by local law enforcement that one of our independent contract teachers was under investigation for possible criminal activity' Clark said in a statement to Click2Houston.

'When we learned of the investigation we took what we believed was the best possible action, which was too immediately sever all our ties with this contractor. Our priority will always be with our students and our organization.'

Speaking to MailOnline in May after Guardiola was charged, ex-wife Kaytha Coker said 'The man is unbelievably gifted and had everything in the world going for him.'
