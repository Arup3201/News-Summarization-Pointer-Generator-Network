Gold standard: A pot of freshly brewed White Smoked Tea from the Wee Tea Company, Scotland, which has been named the world's finest cuppa

When going in search of the world's best cup of tea, you might think of heading to lowlands of Assam in India, or of taking a trip to the Far East and the mountains of Oolong.

But the finest brew in the world is actually being grown by a Northern Irishman on a disused sheep farm in Scotland, and has just been awarded the prestigious Salon du Thé Gold Award in Paris.

The fragrant leaf is so rare and so highly prized that grower Tam O'Braan is selling it for £1,150 per lb - 200 times the usual price - making it the second most expensive in the world.

In addition, most of his tea is being exported to China, a feat likened to selling coals to Newcastle.

The success comes as something of a surprise to Mr O'Braan, who founded his Wee Tea Company in 2011 with £140,000 and just three plants.

Mr O'Braan told The Times that he spent years on organic farms around the world, studying how best to grow crops in Scotland's cold climate, and convinced himself he could do it.

While he initially met with success, creating 2,000 cuttings from his original plants, disaster struck in 2012 when the coldest winter in 200 years all but killed his crop.

He said that after the setback he and his wife were too embarrassed to tell anyone what they were doing, so kept their operation a secret.

But on Valentine's Day last year the plants sprouted again, at which point Mr O'Braan revealed his scheme, along with his first batches of White and White Smoked Tea.

He sold his first tea at Christmas by mail order, with most of it going abroad, and Fortnum and Mason have now started stocking the leaves at £30 for a 35g sachet, or roughly £10 per cup.

Tam O'Braan, who is from Northern Ireland, developed his tea plantation on an old sheep farm in Perthshire (pictured) using £140,000 and just three plants from which he managed to grow 2,000 cuttings

And today the White Smoked variety was handed the top gong at Paris's prestigious tea awards, making it officially the best cuppa on the planet.

Mr O'Braan said: ‘We started with a dream and pursued it. It’s wonderful to have all our hard work recognised.

'Some said we were mad but my partners and I knew we could do it, and with two new daughters on the way I confidently expect my children and grandchildren to be producing tea. 

'We are in it for the long haul.’ 

The upmarket Palm Court at the Balmoral hotel in Edinburgh has also announced it will be serving the beverage as part of its afternoon tea range, priced at £10 per pot.

Executive Chef Jeff Bland said: 'At the Balmoral, we are always looking to promote Scottish produce to our international guests and local visitors alike.

As well as being sold by mail order online, and at Fortnum and Mason in London, the award-winning brew can also be found at the Balmoral Hotel Palm Court, Edinburgh (pictured), for £10 per pot

'I was extremely impressed with the flavours of the Dalreoch white and smoked teas. It is even more impressive that the teas are able to grow in our climate.

'As a nation of tea lovers, it is fantastic news that The Wee Tea Plantation has delivered such an impressive product to such a high standard.

'Many tea connoisseurs visit The Balmoral for our wide selection of loose leaf teas, and we are thrilled to be adding these two new local teas to our collection on an exclusive basis.'

The tea taste test... by Jim McBeth 

An urge to delicately raise one’s pinkie in its honour is irresistible. The china cup perched on a delicate saucer somehow demands reverence. The tea it contains has, after all, been 5,000 years in the making – surely it is owed more respect than your average mug of PG Tips.

When the warm golden liquid, cooler than one might expect from a cuppa, is raised to the lips, does one notice the suggestion of smokey apple, or a hint of botanicals?

Yes, there is definitely apple in its clean, fresh flavour. But as to the botanicals, I don’t even know what they are.

Pinkies out: Jim McBeth detects a hint of smoky apple flavour and a hint of botanicals in the clean, fresh flavour of the award-winning White Smoked Tea

These terms are used by the visionary who has produced the first tea in the world to be grown in Scotland.

Tam O’Braan has created something very special, so special in fact that he is on course to sell it to the Chinese – the tea retailing equivalent of sending coals to Newcastle and persuading the people of the Inuit tribe to buy a refrigerator.

Sipping the tea, one can appreciate its appeal. It is unusually delicate and fine. Suffice to say, it tastes lovely and one would be loath to gulp it down, grab one’s bag and run off to the office.

But as a lover of very strong black coffee and weak black Scottish Blend, it would take a palate more refined than mine to extol all of its virtues.

Mr O’Braan assures me, however, that experts who know about things, men whose tongues are insured for £1million, have informed him officially that he is making the best tea in the world.

International orders are already flooding in for his white and white smoked teas, which are produced in the wilds of Highland Perthshire by his Wee Tea Company, based on the Dalreoch estate near Dunkeld.

The tea's makers believe it benefits from altitude, clean mountain air and fresh spring water which is unique to Scotland

High-class London store Fortnum & Mason has already sold 230 kilos at £2,300 a kilo – or £30 for a convenient 35g sachet. Working out at £10 a cup, it is the second most expensive tea in the world.

And from today, in the sumptuous surroundings of the Palm Court in Edinburgh’s Balmoral Hotel, an iconic venue for afternoon tea, Mr O’Braan’s produce is, in another world first, now up for the public taste test.

The prestigious hotel on Princes Street has secured exclusive rights to put the teas on their menu, a snip at £10 a pot – twice the usual cost of ordinary afternoon tea – with an accompaniment of the ‘finest shortbread in the world’.

This is highly pleasing to a man who was once regarded as mad for sinking £140,000 into the dream of growing tea in the cold ‘marginal’ climate of Scotland – and producing a drink of such distinction and quality that it costs 200 times more than the usual stuff.

‘The price reflects the rarity,’ said the former chemist, a father-of-two whose wife, Gracie, is expecting to deliver twin daughters before Mothering Sunday.

His tea came first in the prestigious French Salon de Thé awards in Paris, which was, he said, like receiving an accolade for making the finest of fine wine.

He added: ‘We started with a dream and pursued it. It’s wonderful to have all our hard work recognised. Some said we were mad but my partners and I knew we could do it, and with two new daughters on the way I confidently expect my children and grandchildren to be producing tea. We are in it for the long haul.’

Mr O’Braan, 44, has 14,000 plants growing at 700ft above sea level, more than enough to produce tea for the next 70 years.

The Wee Tea Company was originally the brainchild of his partner Jamie Russell, and they were joined by Derek Walker.

The partners believe tea plants benefit from altitude, clean mountain air and the fresh spring water unique to Scotland.

Mr O’Braan said: ‘I’ve worked in five different continents researching how to grow organic foods in marginal climates. I knew we could grow crops in Scotland, and we have.

‘The honour of being the most expensive tea in the world rests with a black Chinese tea costing £4,000 a kilo.

‘Bizarrely, it is not produced to drink but to be bought and sold as an investment.

‘Our tea, while expensive, is very much made to sipped.’

I’ll drink all the tea in Perthshire to that.
