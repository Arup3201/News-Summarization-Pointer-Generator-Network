With their big eyes and fluffy paws, it’s not hard to find puppies and kittens adorable.

These two, however, have a larger dose of the ahhh-factor.

Jack Russell-cross Valerie, and kitten Pixie, were born with giant love heart markings in their fur.

Adorable 16-day-old Valerie is one of 25 dogs in her owner's household in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Stafforshire.

Valerie is one of the latest additions to the Boardmans' house which is home to 25 dogs

Joanne and Dave Boardman already had a Great Dane, poodle, British Bulldog and Jack Russel before welcoming Valerie into the family along with three other Jack-Russel cross pups.

Speaking of the new addition's distinctive markings, Mrs Boardman, 40 said: 'It is just so obvious you can’t miss it. I have never seen anything like it before.' 

The couple, who delivered the puppies themselves, spend £120 a month feeding their giant brood of pets.

'Because of the number of dogs we have I don’t think we will be able to keep her.

The couple are afraid they don't have room for tiny Valerie among all the other dogs that already live with them

'The dogs aren’t too bad with barking and
 there is always somebody in the house. They will sleep in the bedrooms 
and in the kitchen.'

Joanne’s daughter Stacey,  22, said: 'When Valerie was born, my mum texted me a photograph straight away and you could just see the heart really clearly.

'I’d like to keep her, but I don’t think I will be able to persuade my dad. We keep in touch with all the people who have had a puppy off us and usually they come back for another one.

'We always make sure they are going to a good home.

Mischievous kitten Pixie is easily spotted by the marking on her fluffy coat

Her owner is Rebecca Martin-Merchant, who says the heart shape was apparent when she was born

She said: 'My mum and dad have always had dogs and then I wanted some when I was older.

'I kept bringing home Chihuahuas and hiding them in my room from my dad.'

Pixie the kitten, owned by Rebecca Martin-Merchant, is easily recognised roaming the streets of Cambridgeshire with her grey heart-shaped marking.

Ms Martin-Merchant said the love heart was obvious as soon as she was born, and it doesn't appear to have faded.
