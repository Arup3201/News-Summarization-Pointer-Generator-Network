Cristiano Ronaldo may have been crowned the best player in the world, and the leading goalscorer in Europe, but now he wants to go a step further.

The Real Madrid star, who received his third Golden Shoe for most goals in Europe for last season on Wednesday, now says he wants to be the greatest player ever.

Ronaldo is quoted in the Spanish papers saying that he believes he has 'a lot of years left' at Real, and is aiming to be remembered as the greatest of all time, not just for the club, but in the world.

Both AS and Marca lead on Cristiano Ronaldo's claim that he can be the greatest player ever

However, while the Madrid-based press focus on their club's Portuguese star, the Catalan papers feature his great rival Lionel Messi.

Sport dub the Argentine star as 'The King of Europe' while Mundo Deportivo call the Barcelona forward 'Golden Messi'.

The four-time Ballon D'Or winner drew level with Raul's Champions League goal-scoring record - one goal more than Ronaldo has in the competition, on Wednesday night.

Elsewhere in Europe, the Italian papers took a sympathetic view of Roma's second defeat to Bayern Munich. 

La Gazzetta dello Sport say 'Roma need a beer' after being beaten by a team from another planet, but are optimistic about the Italian side's chances when they come up against the 'human' teams in their group.

Corriere dello Sport has a similar outlook, admitting that 'Bayern are too much for Roma' but playing up the chances of qualifying behind the Germans.

Roma's defeat to Bayern Munich is the big story in Italy, but the papers are confident they can still progress
