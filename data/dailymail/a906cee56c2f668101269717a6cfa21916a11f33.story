She's widely touted as one of the most  beautiful women in Hollywood, and Jessica Alba most certainly proves her worth in her new campaign.

The actress, 33, is the face of the Braun Silk-épil 9 epilator - and shows off her toned and tanned legs in the new imagery.

In one shot, the mother-of-two shows off her long limbs wearing a chic white swimsuit and red stilettos. In another, she can be seen striking a pose wearing high-waisted white shorts and crop top teamed with a peach jacket.

Speaking about her new role, Jessica said: 'I am a big fan of the new Braun Silk- épil 9 because it puts me in control of my beauty routine. Soft, smooth skin is my foundation for every look.

'Whether I'm wearing a dramatic gown for a premiere, a cute minidress out with my girlfriends or just hanging on the beach with my family, using it makes my skin look as good as I feel.'

It seems that business is booming for Jessica, who on Thursday celebrated the success of her business venture, The Honest Company, which she called a 'dream come true'.

She shared a photo with her Instagram followers that shows her reveling at a bash, captioning the snap: 'We're 3yrs old! @honest! #holymoly #sohappy #dreamcometrue #pinchme #TheHonestCompany #thehonestlife'

According to Inc. magazine, The Honest Company - which makes non-toxic household products - made more than $150m (£97m) in revenue in 2014 and is reported to be worth $1b (£65m).

And now the star is launching a cosmetics range after attracting a following of consumers who are fans of the brand.

'From day one when we opened our doors, we had so many people say "when are you going to do makeup?"' she shared. 'I’ve been developing and working on it for a couple of years now, and we’re going to be able to deliver on our promise to our customers.'

And on February 12, Jessica was seen scouting a property in LA as a possible location for the first-ever The Honest Company store.

Jessica's business savvy has inspired Cash, who recently launched the sock line Pair Of Thieves, which he co-founded with two friends.
