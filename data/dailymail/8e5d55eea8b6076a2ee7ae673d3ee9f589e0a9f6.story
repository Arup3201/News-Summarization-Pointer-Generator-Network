Alan Pardew is set to drop £12million Remy Cabella as he admits there is one simple solution to easing the pressure on his position – victory at Swansea on Saturday.

The Newcastle boss has endured another week of intense speculation regarding his future following Monday’s televised 1-0 loss at Stoke.

Fans on the street have started to let their feelings be known and defeat at Swansea would make for an uncomfortable international fortnight.

Owner Mike Ashley will not sack Pardew, regardless of Saturday afternoon’s outcome, but the United manager does not want to rest on that assumption.

Indeed, he tore in to some of his players on the training ground this week and we understand he will shake up team selection against the Swans.

Cabella – their marquee summer signing – is almost certain to be axed after a string of weak and ineffective performances, while Yoan Gouffran and Emmanuel Riviere are also under threat. Gabrial Obertan will come in for his first Premier League start in 18 months.

And Pardew said: ‘We haven’t got time to wait for players to come through. We need that to happen now.

‘Remy Cabella has got to start performing now. Our younger players like Sammy (Ameobi) and (Paul) Dummett have got to deliver now, we aren’t hanging about anymore.

‘It’s important we step up to the plate.’

And, when asked what it would take to ease the scrutiny on his position, Pardew said: ‘I have to win a game to calm it down a little bit, particularly for the players. 

‘They need the confidence of a win. Stoke is a tough game but Swansea is even tougher.

‘Normally if we went there and came away with a draw and played well I would be quite pleased.

‘But that probably isn’t going to be enough to take the spotlight off us. I have to accept that.

‘Only if we win will it take the spotlight away a little bit. It is still going to be around us. I am trying to get everyone to understand in my training ground that isn’t going to go away. It will be here a while and we need to be strong.’

The players remain behind the manager, evidenced by televisions inside the training ground being turned off when speculation centres on their boss.

But they need to return on that support on the pitch.

Pardew added: ‘The characters will grow as we go along. This is a difficult club to play for, I think.

‘It can be the greatest club in the world to play for when you are winning, but we are not winning, so it becomes even harder to play for us, and we need to make sure we can handle that.

‘These players are going to learn more in the next six weeks than they have for the last two years of their careers.’

Pardew, meanwhile, refused to be drawn on the suggestion that the current squad has been left short in key areas by the failings of a transfer model in which he does not have autonomy on incomings.

‘The way players are brought in, it’s obviously a process that we go through, but the model is to buy younger players, and that makes it difficult if you are not winning,’ he said, chief scout Graham Carr the man responsible for the bulk of recruitment.

‘We have produced some fantastic signings at this football clubs – I don’t think anyone would deny that – so we can’t suddenly say we have got it all wrong and this is the wrong model and these are the wrong players.’
