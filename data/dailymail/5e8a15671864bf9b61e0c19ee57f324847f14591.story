Scientists have created a map of the matter in a segment of the universe, which could reveal how the universe came to be.

The incredible ‘pencil beam’ shows the distribution of the cosmic web across a slice of the sky 10.8 billion years ago.

Amazingly it accurately predicts where galaxies will appear - and it could help us understand the evolution of the universe, both into the past and the future. 

 

Researchers led by the Max Planck Institute of Astronomy in Germany have observed a 'pencil beam' of the universe's cosmic web. This animation shows the slice of the night sky seen by the team. Denser regions of matter are bright, while the darker regions show the 'voids' between galaxies

The research was led by Dr Khee-Gan Lee from the Max Planck Institute of Astronomy in Germany.

The three-dimensional map shows the ‘adolescent’ universe as it appeared just three billion years after the Big Bang, which occurred about 13.8 billion years ago.

Using a technique similar to an X-ray computer-tomographic (CT) scan used in medicine, the researchers revealed the dense grid of light from background galaxies.

The snippet we see here, though, merely predicts where galaxies will appear based on the density of matter and dark matter in certain areas of the universe - the cosmic web - before galaxies formed.

'The cosmic web is a nickname for the way in which matter is distributed on the largest scales of millions of light-years,' explains Dr Lee to MailOnline.

'This pattern has been seen in the nearby universe when astronomers plot the positions of a large numbers of galaxies.

'In the nearby universe, we see the galaxies arranged along the web-like filaments that intersect in 'galaxy clusters'.

However, at greater distances it becomes progressively harder to measure large numbers of galaxy positions to do this kind of mapping, therefore our 'CT scan' instead uses the imprint of hydrogen gas, which also traces matter, to map out the cosmic web in 3D.

'The structures in our map represent the cosmic web at a much earlier stage of its growth, when the universe was merely a quarter its current age.'

This is made possible as the light from background galaxies passes through hydrogen gas in the universe.

In the map the lighter areas show regions of high-density matter where galaxies would ultimately form, while the black regions show ‘voids’ - the space between galaxies.

The astronomers used the Keck I telescope at the W. M. Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawaii to make the map.

In total they managed to observe the segment of space for four hours, although they had been hoping for longer.

However that was enough time to create the three-dimensional section of the universe almost 11 billion light-years away.

Speaking to MailOnline, Dr Xavier Prochaska from the University of California Santa Cruz, who was part of the research team, commented on the significance of the 3D map.

‘At the top level it’s a test of our current theory of cosmology,' he tells MailOnline.

'It shows us how the universe forms over cosmic time.'

He described the segment as a ‘pinhole through the universe’ or a ‘pencil beam’ showing its grand history.

Lead researcher Dr Lee, meanwhile, adds: ‘This is the first time people have used light to map the universe in such a way in 3D.

‘They have used it in the past, but previously it has always been to study the cosmic web in 1D, directionally along the line of sight.’

The segment, seen here, was 100 million light-years in length, 2.5 million light-years wide and six million light-years tall. It was made using the Keck I observatory and peering further and further into space. The results reveal the density of matter in this region of the universe, with brighter regions containing more

The astronomers used the Keck I telescope at the W. M. Keck Observatory (shown) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii to make the map. In total they managed to observe the segment of space for four hours, although they had been hoping for longer. In December this year they will attempt to make longer observations

This is also the first time the cosmic web has been mapped at such a vast distance.

Since observing to such immense distances is also looking back in time, the map reveals the early stages of cosmic structure formation when the universe was only a quarter of its current age.

This was during an era when the galaxies were undergoing a major ‘growth spurt’.

The map provides a tantalising glimpse of giant structures extending across millions of light-years, and paves the way for more extensive studies that should reveal not only the structure of the cosmic web, but also details of how it works.

This includes the ways that gas moved around the web into galaxies, providing the raw material for the growth of galaxies through the formation of stars and planets.

Dr Lee explains that the map should be able to predict the existence of these galaxies - and perhaps even some too small to see by other methods.

And he also says it could help us understand the physics that govern galaxy formation, and even understand the future of the universe.

‘An understanding of the past will help us better predict the future of the universe,’ he says.

The researchers add they will be hoping to repeat the experiment later this year, possibly in December, and map an even larger segment of the universe.

The resultant 3D map shows the distribution of matter in one region of space

@highlight

This cosmic web shows where matter is most densely concentrated 

@highlight

In this particular 'slice' of the universe it shows how such matter was distributed before the galaxies even formed

@highlight

This means it can be used to predict where galaxies should have formed, which can be confirmed through observational evidence

It is the first time the cosmic web has been mapped at such a vast distance - in this case 10.8 billion light-years from Earth

It could be used to help understand how the universe took shape
