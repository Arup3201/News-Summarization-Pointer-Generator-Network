Russian President Vladimir Putin said he earned 5.7 million rubles (£119,000) last year - but his spokesman earned almost double that.

According to Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov, he earned 11.1 million rubles (£233,000) in the last year - 5.4 million rubles more than President Putin.

Income declarations are a new obligation for Russian officials, which were introduced in 2012.

The declarations became mandatory for state officials after First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov's salary raised eyebrows.

Mr Shuvalov was forced him to make clear none of his interests infringed Russian law.

In
 the most recent salary declarations, Mr Shuvalov, the government's 
pointman on the economy, was the highest earner, with a family income of
 449.4 million rubles (£9.4million).

Data published by the Kremlin stated Putin's spokesman's salary was 5.4 million rubles higher than the president's

His high salary was around half of that earned by his wife, according to the Kremlin's website.

A spokesman for Shuvalov said the wealthy official was shifting his assets back to Russia from accounts and trusts held abroad.

His move was prompted by upcoming changes to Russian law banning officials from having accounts and assets abroad.

Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev earned 5.8 million rubles (£122,000) according to the Kremlin data, while his wife declared no income.
