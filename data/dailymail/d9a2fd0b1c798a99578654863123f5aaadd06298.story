Senior police are shocked at the actions of a father who carried his two-year-old son on a drunken nighttime motorbike ride through southwestern Sydney, without a helmet and without the lights on.

The 27-year-old Busby man was spotted by officers attached to Operation Talon - the state's gun crime squad -Â  traveling through the intersection of St Johns Road and South Liverpool Road at Heckenberg around 9:45pm on Saturday.

He was not wearing a helmet, his vehicle's lights were off and he appeared to be carrying a bag.

He attempted to flee police by riding onto a footpath, dropping the bike and attempting to run down nearby Karoola Street.

'Unbelieveable': A Sydney man was caught riding an unregistered motorbike without a helmet and carrying a 2-year-old

When police finally apprehended the man they discovered he was carrying a two-year-old boy, who has since been placed in the care of his mother.

Assistant Police Commissioner John Hartley described the incident as one of of 'the strangest and most dangerous acts of driving and endangering a child's life' he had encountered.

'It's unbelievable to put a two-year-old's life in jeopardy this way,' he told News Corp Australia.

The man failed a roadside breath-test and may face various charges including ride while disqualified, riding in a manner dangerous, riding an unregistered vehicle and hinder police.

'The charges have been prepared, they haven't been served on him but we're just about there,' Green Valley inspector Steve Corry told MailOnline.

'It's unbelievable that it's occured.'

Insp Corry said he was not aware of any explanations offered by the man for his alarming actions.

'I don't know if he was going on a joyride or if there was a purpose to his trip,' he said, adding that the vehicle was a trail bike.

Danger spot: Residents say the area around Karoola Street in Busby is notorious for dangerous motorbike activity

Residents near where the arrest was made have told MailOnline there is an increasing amount of worrying motorbike activity in the area.

Anne Carter, of Busby, said she saw a man on a red motorbike 'speeding' along Busby Road who prompted a police chase on Mother's Day.

'He didn't have a helmet on,' she said.

'I could see him out of the corner of my eye, I had to swerve...I've seen a lot of it lately, they're using our street as a thoroughfare.'

She said the driver fled through a reserve in south Busby called Bradshaw Park.

Margaret Daniels agreed: 'There's that many chases through the area and around Bradshaw Park you don't pay any attention anymore.

'None of (the riders) wear helmets, they're mad, idiots.'

Investigations into the incident continue.
