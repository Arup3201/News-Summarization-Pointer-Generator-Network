A John Lennon fan has become an internet sensation after his tattoo of the singer looked more like Harry Potter than the Beatles star.

The inking has been branded a 'tattoo fail' by Still Game actor Greg Hemphill who Tweeted: 'Imagine all the wizards*'.

The hilarious image was sent to a specialist Twitter account that deals with unfortunate tattoos before going viral.

Imagine there's no resemblance . . . it's very easy if you try: An un-named John Lennon fan wanted to get a tattoo featuring the image of the former Beatles star, right, but ended up with one looking like Harry Potter, left

Social media users began immediately sharing the image including their own acerbic comments on the artwork.

One Twitter user called Ahammersfan said: 'It looks like John Lennon after a stroke.'

A second, Lubo1967 added: 'Jesus H Christ looks like Harry Potter with a broken nose.'

It is unlikely that the artist intended drawing the popular fictional wizard after including the word 'Imagine' and a peace sign underneath the dubious portrait.

A charitable Matt McFarlane said the image resembled 'a young John Lennon', although another user suggested Harry Potter would be able to 'magic all the spots away'.

The tattoo is being widely lampooned on Twitter as it looks far more like Harry Potter than John Lennon

Blue, manager of the Into You tattoo studio in Clerkenwell, London said: 'Obviously this is the work of a very bad tattoo artist. It is unforgivable for a client to go in looking for an image of John Lennon and go home with Harry Potter.

'Before getting any tattoo a client should fully research the studio beforehand. There are very good studios with excellent artists. They will have extensive portfolios in the studio and in many cases online so you can assess the quality of this work.

'In cases such as this, it is possible to get the tattoo removed by laser although that is incredibly expensive. Maybe it would be cheaper for the person involved to buy a few Harry Potter books and become a fan.'
