Lee Cattermole has invited Roy Hodgson to the Stadium of Light – for the Sunderland enforcer believes he is the man to anchor England’s midfield.

There has been much debate over the merits of Arsenal’s Jack Wilshere in such a role and it is the one position in Hodgson’s team which appears up for grabs.

Cattermole’s former Black Cats team-mate Jack Colback – now at Newcastle – had been earmarked for a trial run in the holding berth until injury ruled him out of the recent matches with Norway and Switzerland.

But Sunderland’s in-form midfielder has urged Three Lions manager Hodgson to check on his progress having made huge strides under the tutorship of Gus Poyet on Wearside. 

Indeed, the Uruguayan boss says his own country would relish a Cattermole type at the heart of their engine-room.

And the 26-year-old said: ‘You see lads getting opportunities now and for me that has got to be a motivation.

‘In recent years, it is not something for me to be too interested in because of the names that were playing - the Gerrards and the Lampards. But you look at the boys who have got in and who are playing well and that is something that I am trying to achieve.

‘So yes, it has become a goal for me getting into the squad. England is going through that cycle of change right now.

‘We’ve got a few English players here – Jack Rodwell, Adam Johnson, Connor Wickham and me - and I’d like to think Roy Hodgson will come up (to see us play).’

Cattermole, of course, is hindered by a chequered disciplinary record, seven red cards having earned him the nickname ‘Lee Clattermole’.

But he has now enjoyed a run of 28 matches without seeing red – he previously averaged a dismissal every 26 games, a ratio only bettered by John Hartson and Vinnie Jones – and believes a calmer head is a by-product of Poyet’s faith.

‘I am in a good time in my career at the moment,’ he went on. ‘I feel I am not having to try as hard on the pitch and that helps.

‘That is a big thing for me. I am really comfortable about my game, very focussed every week now.

‘Gus Poyet sides have a big role for the defensive midfielder. Since the manager has come in I have adapted my game to what he wants and that is pure and simple, a defensive midfielder. I have learnt an unbelievable amount since he came here.’

Cattermole was capped at every level from Under-16 to Under-21 and admits he expected to progress to the seniors.

And the former Middlesbrough academy player makes no secret of his desire to once again pull on the white of his country.

‘My last game for the Under 21s was in the Euros final in Sweden against Germany. I could have played on the next season but Stuart Pearce told me it was time for the next generation,’ he said.

‘I probably did expect a senior call up at the time. So it would mean an awful lot to me to get a call-up now. Every English player would be lying if they said they were not looking to play for England.

‘The wider perception is that players don’t care but a lot of the time, it is just trying to be cool around each other, not letting on how much you really do care.’

Cattermole, meanwhile, believes there would be room for himself and North-East adversary Colback in the England set-up.

‘Jack has got in thanks to his performances for us last season and he has obviously had a good pre-season (at Newcastle),’ he said. ‘The manager obviously fancies him and fair play to him. I spoke to Jack last week and he really enjoyed his time with England. Now he is in that circle he has an opportunity to improve himself.’
