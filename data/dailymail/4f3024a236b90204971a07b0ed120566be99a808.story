Michigan authorities have released a sketch of the man suspected of snatching a young mother as she finished up her night shift at a gas station on Friday.

Jessica Heeringa, 25, who has a three-year-old son, vanished 15 minutes from the end of her shift at an Exxon gas station in North Shores. Her car and purse were found left behind at the scene.

The sketch of a wavy-haired man was based on an account given by a witness who saw a male drive away from the gas station - and police said they believe it will reinvigorate their investigation.

Do you know this man? Police have released this sketch, left, of a man seen driving away from the gas station in Michigan where young mother Jessica Heeringa, right, was last seen on Friday night

'With the sketch, now we are retracing some of our steps' Norton 
Shores Police Chief Daniel Shaw told WZZM. 'We are taking the sketch out to some 
of those individuals we've already talked to, and are showing them the 
sketch.

'Someone knows this person. That is a very good drawing. Someone is going to know who that is.'

Authorities have also released video, shot from the nearby Old Homestead Tavern, showing a minivan witnesses told police had been in the area around the same time that Heeringa went missing.

Norton Shores Police Chief Dan Shaw admitted that the video leaves much to be desired in terms of hard-hitting evidence, 
but they're hopeful that releasing it could help unlock the 
mystery.

Chief Shaw told WOOD-TV:
'I wish I had the technology like you see on TV where you can blow it 
up and I can see the driver inside, but that doesnâ€™t exist for me.'

He told the station that the vehicle appears to match the Town & Country minivan seen by witnesses in the area prior to Ms Heeringa's disappearance.

Authorities are now looking to question its driver, described as a 'heavyset' white male, between 30 and 40 years old.

Police suspect that she may have been familiar with her abductor.

'There is no sign of a struggle in the store, so it's possible she knew who the person was as a customer or as an acquaintance,' Chief Shaw told ABCNews.

Mystery: Heeringa has a three-year-old son, who family members said she would never leave behind

Authorities were alerted on Friday night when a worried customer called about the unattended gas station at 11:15pm.

That customer, Craig Harpster, said he came to the gas station like he normally does after work, and noticed that no one was there.

After looking around and finding no one, he told WOOD-TV that he had a 'gut feeling that something bad had happened' and called police.

Mr Harpster's 911 call was also released by authorities over the weekend.

In the call, he tells the dispatcher:
'There's nobody here. Um... it wouldn't allow me to pump gas. I just 
walked inside, there's nobody. There's a car here. There's another car 
out front. But it's just very suspicious why there's nobody here.'

Ms Heeringa made her last sale at 11pm.

The missing woman's family made a
heartfelt plea for information on Sunday as police reclassified her 
disappearance as an abduction.

In
a press conference on Sunday morning, Chief Shaw said officers were 
treating the case as abduction after examining evidence at the scene.

No money was stolen from the gas station and it appeared that Ms Heeringa had left cleaning supplies on the counter.

Police described Heeringa as a white female, 5'1 tall, approximately 110 lbs., with blonde shoulder length hair, and blue eyes.

Jessica is also known to wear wire rim glasses. She may be wearing a blue collared shirt saying 'Sternberg Exxon.'

The gas station has no surveillance cameras so police are relying on public information for help in the investigation.

'I'm sure she was abducted,' Ms Heeringa's mother told Michigan Live. '[There was] no struggle. She was cleaning a machine, she left her car keys, [and] no money was taken from the gas station.'

The
anguished family were praying for Jessica's safe return. 'She's loved 
by everyone,' her mother said. 'She has a 3-year-old boy who is missing 
his mom and wants her back.'

Hope: Liz Lunsford of Muskegon releases balloons across the street from the Exxon Mobil gas station

Derek Antol, a regular customer at the station, told Michigan Live, that he was 'dumbfounded' by the incident.

'I didn't know her, I didn't even know her name until this,' Antol said. 'But she was always very sweet, friendly gal.'

Antol said he is offering a reward of $500 for tips that lead to an arrest. 'I would hope if it was my kid people would show up here to support me,' he added. 'I am very surprised that people aren't here.'
