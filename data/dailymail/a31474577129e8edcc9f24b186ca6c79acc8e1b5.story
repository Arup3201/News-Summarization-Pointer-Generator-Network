Jailed: Imran Khawaja, 27, originally from west London, who posed with a severed head and spent six months in Syria, faces 12 years in prison

A British extremist who  faked his own death in Syria so he could return to Britain to recruit new jihadists has been jailed for 12 years today.

Imran Khawaja, 27, became a jihadi recruitment 'poster boy' and was filmed posing with severed heads and repeatedly encouraged other Muslims to join him in the war-torn country.

Khawaja  spent six months fighting in Syria last year but fled a terrorist training camp because of a lack of 'war booty'.

The Londoner, who was nicknamed 'Barbie' and has a extremely low IQ, complained about 'having enough' of jihad without cocoa butter, toothpaste, moisturiser, and toilet paper.

His family, who said he had shown no real commitment to Islam before he went to Syria, sent him pictures of them eating at Nandos chicken restaurant in the hope he would come home.

Today he was jailed for 12 years with a further five years on licence after that.

Judge Mr Justice Baker told him he poses 'a significant risk of serious harm' to the public and believes he was returning to the UK to recruit others.

Woolwich Crown Court heard he  received firearms training at a base run by associates of British fanatics affiliated to ISIS.

The bodybuilder entered the warzone after buying a flight to Kurdistan on January 26 last year.

Khawaja, also known as Abu Daigham al Baritani, was then reported as being killed in action on June 3 by the terrorist group Rayat al-Tawheed.

But it was a ruse and on the same day he was arrested after returning to Britain.

He had asked his taxi driver cousin Tahir Bhatti to drive to Bulgaria, pick him up and then drive him back to the UK, avoiding the well-worn jihadist route via flights to and from Turkey. 

While on his way back to Britain he spread rumours of his own death.

But Khawaja and Bhatti were arrested by police as they reached the UK port of Dover in Kent.

Khawaja admitted preparation of terrorist acts on or before January 26 last year as well as attending a terrorism training camp between January and June 4 last year.

Co-accused: Tahir Bhatti, the older cousin of Imran Khawaja, was given a 21-month sentence picking him up from Bulgariia, while friend Asim Ali, 33, got the same sentence after he admitted assisting and offender and funding terrorism respectively

He has also admitted receiving weapons training and possessing a firearm for terrorist use during a hearing at the Old Bailey. 

Asim Ali, 33, from Ealing, west London has pleaded guilty to making £300 available to Khawaja while knowing or having reason to suspect it might be used for the purposes of terrorism.

And Bhatti, 44, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty assisting an offender.

Ali was handed a 21-month custodial term for entering into a funding arrangement for the purposes of terrorism.  The judge said the offence was serious enough to warrant an immediate jail term, despite the £300 donation representing a relatively small sum.

Bhatti was also given a 21-month sentence for assisting an offender. His term was reduced to 95 days after time spent in custody awaiting the trial was taken into account.

Members of the defendants’ families gasped as the sentences were delivered.

Ruse: Khawaja's fake death was announced on the same day he arrived in Britain and was arrested

Conspiracy: Khawaja was arrested at Dover last June a short time after his militant group posted a bogus message claiming he had been killed in fighting

At an earlier hearing, prosecutor Mark Dawson said that by March 18 last year, Bhatti, who was referred to in a coded message as 'butterbean', was well aware Khawaja was in Syria and that he was clearly training with a view to fighting in Syria.

The court was shown three photographs from Khawaja's phone that allegedly reflected what Bhatti knew about his activities.

The first showed Khawaja in battlefield clothes and a balaclava sitting on a tank with a rifle.

Another showed him with a child sporting a very distinctive tassled hat - the same hat and clothing worn in a number of postings by a terrorist group.

The last photo showed the defendant at a training camp with an assault rifle, the court heard.

By June last year, Bhatti had convinced his cousin to return to the UK saying his parents were not well and he should come home.

The 27-year-old, pictured with a child recruit, spent six months among foreign fighters on the Syrian frontline and left just weeks before Jihadi John began his spree of hostage beheadings

The three men are expected to be handed jail sentences today.

The court was told Ali withdrew £300 two days before Khawaja left the UK. After promising - but never delivering - more money, Ali then received messages that Khawaja needed toiletries and toilet tissue while in Syria.

The court heard Ali sent a message to a friend saying Khawaja 'needs cocoa butter, toothpaste, soap and condoms for the war booty'.

Prosecutor Brian Altman said messages between Khawaja and Ali hinted that he was returning to the UK to help with fundraising as his friends back home had failed to do so.

Mr Altman said it was suggested by Khawaja that Ali would later return to Syria with him.

Former Serco immigration worker with IQ in lowest 12% of country turned into jihadi who posed with beheaded ISIS victims in Syria 

He was the bodybuilding frontman of a terror group designed to inspire and recruit impressionable young Britons by posing with dead bodies and the weaponry of war.

But in private, Imran Khawaja was a gentle family man with a very low IQ, nicknamed Barbie, whose brief time in Syria was blighted by his longing for toothpaste, toilet roll and moisturiser.

The 27-year-old had himself become indoctrinated in the years leading up to his departure for Syria in January 2014, having, his family said, demonstrated no previous serious commitment to Islam.

Khawaja in fact spent the majority of his spare time in the gym and would video himself doing so.

Change: Bodybuilder Imran Khawaja demonstrated no previous serious commitment to Islam but by January last year was in Syria appearing in propaganda films encouraging others to join him 

During his sentencing at Woolwich Crown Court, Khawaja looked on proudly as footage of him panting while sparring with a partner was played. It was one of the few films shown in the court which did not require a content warning from counsel.

Khawaja had spent five years working at a Serco immigration centre but became depressed in 2010 and appeared withdrawn.

It was a surprise to his family, the court heard, that Khawaja's foreign adventure was actually a well-planned trip to a terrorist training camp.

Covering his tracks with brief stints in continental Europe, Khawaja eventually made his way to Syria where he was considered the face of several videos for Rayat al-Tawheed, a group of insurgents designed to raise the profile of Islamic State.

He posed with the severed head of a fighter loyal to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, fired fully-automatic weapons and spoke of the sacrifices his brothers had made - although it was not suggested Khawaja had been responsible for any murders himself.

To his closest friends in the UK, however, he complained about a lack of toiletries. He also wanted condoms, "for the war booty".

Latching on to any hint of discontent, Khawaja's family - many of whom were in the public gallery to watch him get sentenced today - attempted to lure him back to the UK with images of them eating at Nandos chicken restaurant.

At one stage, his sister Azmeena threatened to fly out to Syria and fetch him if he did not return.

Eventually, his cousin Tahir Bhatti, 45, drove to Europe in a desperate last attempt to rescue him.

Bhatti, later jailed after he initially lied about the nature of the trip, told border staff his cousin always wanted to be a "real life GI Joe".

Yesterday, with his head bowed, Khawaja told the judge he was seduced by propaganda and begged young British Muslims not to follow his path - a path which today ended in a lengthy jail term.
