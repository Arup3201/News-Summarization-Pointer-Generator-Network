After a long ad grueling season that saw him go all the way in the Champions League and World Cup, Sami Khedira appears finally able to relax.

The former Stuttgart midfielder posted a picture on Instagram of him and his girlfriend, Lena Gercke, jumping in to their pool.

Real Madrid's players were back in training this week but the World Cup winner was still kicking back after an unprecedented year of success.

Most players can only dream of winning trophies like the Champions league or World Cup, but Khedirea won both in the space of a season.

The 27-year-old has been heavily linked with a move to Arsenal this summer after the arrival of Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez in the Spanish capital.

However, the German's wage demands have apparently caused negotiations to stall and Arsene Wenger has now admitted he may not sign another midfielder.

Chelsea were touted as another option for Khedira but Jose Mourinho recently announced that Chelsea had completed their transfer business for the summer.
