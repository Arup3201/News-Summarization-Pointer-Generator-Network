An Indian teenager manages to put on an incredibly brave face during a nightmare seven hours in the dentist's chair when he had an astonishing 232 teeth-like growths pulled from his mouth.

Unlucky Ashik Gavai, 17, was filmed having the unusual growths chiseled out of his mouth at the JJ Hospital in Mumbai after complaining about a swelling in his lower jaw.

Despite his harrowing ordeal, the youngster managed a faint smile and is seen flashing the peace sign after the surgery was successfully carried out.

Ordeal: Ashik Gavai, 17, with the 232 teeth removed from his jaw after undergoing surgery in Mumbai, India

Ashik was referred to the city's , where doctors found he was suffering from a condition known as complex odontoma.

Odontomas 
are haphazardly arranged tooth-like growths. They are composed of 
enamel, dentin (the yellowish tissue that makes up the bulk of all 
teeth) and pulp tissue (part in the centre of a tooth made up of living 
connective tissue).

They tend to occur in people in their teenage years, such as Mr Gavai.

Mr Gavai the growths removed earlier this week, in what the surgeons believe may be a world-record operation.

'We operated on Monday and it took us almost seven hours,' head of dentistry Sunanda Dhivare-Palwankar, told AFP.

'We
 thought it [would] be simple surgery but once we opened [him up] there 
were multiple pearl-like teeth inside the jaw bone,' she said.

After removing those the surgeons also found a larger 'marble-like' structure which they struggled to extract.

It eventually had to be 'chiselled out' and remove in fragments, Ms Dhivare-Palwankar added.

The teenager's father, Suresh Gavai, told the Mumbai Mirror newspaper he had feared the swelling was a cancerous growth.

Fortunately the surgeons managed to maintain teenager's jawbone structure, meaning it should heal without any deformities. Once removed, odontomas do not recur.
