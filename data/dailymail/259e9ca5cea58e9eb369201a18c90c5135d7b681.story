Michael Sam is no longer attached to an NFL team and none of them appear to want to pick him up because his sexual orientation causes too much distraction, claims a Buffalo Bills star.

Offensive lineman Eric Wood goes on, more specifically, to blame the media for focusing on the personal life of the NFL's first openly gay draft pick.

'Blame that on espn,' Wood tweeted in response to Sam's inability to find an NFL home. 'No one wants the distraction.'

Wood's comment came after sports 
commentator Ross Tucker publicly wondered on Twitter why 'Michael Sam 
performed much better than most expected and still isn't even on a 
practice squad?'

The comments also hark back to ESPN's report on Sam's locker room habits earlier this month and their subsequent apology.

Instead
 of focusing on the St. Louis Rams' first round of cuts, reporter Josina
 Anderson chose to feature Sam's shower etiquette.

'Another
 Rams defensive player told me that “Sam is respecting our space” and 
that, from his perspective, he seems to think that Michael Sam is kind 
of waiting to take a shower, as not to make his teammates feel 
uncomfortable,' Anderson said.

The reporter said she also asked other players about Sam's showering schedule.

After
 public outcry, ESPN spokesman Josh Krulewitz wrote in a statement that 
the network 'regrets the manner in which we presented our report.'

'Clearly,
 yesterday we collectively failed to meet the standards we have set in 
reporting on LGBT-related topics in sports,' he added.

While
 getting cut by the St. Louis Rams means Sam's dreams of becoming the 
first gay NFL player have now been placed on hold, he was undeterred.

He posted a message of positivity to his Twitter account over the weekend despite his obstacles.

'The most worthwhile things in life rarely come easy, this is a lesson I've always known. The journey continues,' he wrote.

His
 boyfriend, Vito Cammisano, also showed his support for Sam by tweeted a
 picture of the couple together, wearing shirts from the University of 
Missouri, where they both attended college.

Sam showed up for his face-to-face exit meeting with St. Louis Rams coach Jeff Fisher, a few hours after clearing waivers.

Sam
 arrived at Rams Park via through the media entrance Sunday afternoon 
still looking right at home clad in T-shirt, shorts and flip flips. He 
shook hands with two reporters and accepted well wishes but declined 
further comment before heading upstairs to see the coach who wasn't 
afraid to add the first openly gay player to the roster.

All 21 players released Saturday cleared waivers. Sam's future was a major topic on Twitter, some of it vitriol, some reasoned.

The Rams appeared unlikely to re-sign Sam to the 10-player practice squad because the defensive line is their strongest unit and they need help elsewhere.

The meeting with Sam meeting was postponed a day so he could attend Missouri's opening victory over South Dakota State.

The 7th-round draft pick has been outspoken and confident as his progress was watched as closely as any rookie in the league.

He has been cheered by athletes and celebrities.

In the end, the defensive end couldn't make a team stocked with pass-rushers.

The news was first reported by ESPN.

Sam still has a chance to get picked up by another team or to make the Rams' practice squad.

On Saturday, he attended Missouri's opener in Columbia, a 1 1/2-hour drive west on I-70 from Rams Park.

He was introduced to the crowd at the cut down deadline in the end zone alongside defensive E.J. Gaines, a sixth-round pick who made the team.

Sam blew a kiss and waved to the crowd, then walked back to the sideline.

He posed for a few pictures then started looking at his phone and headed for the locker room.

The Rams selected Sam, the SEC co-defensive player of the year at Missouri, with the 249th overall pick out of 256 overall during May's draft.

Sam came out following his final season at Missouri.

Rams coach Jeff Fisher was proud to have made the landmark pick, but he made clear from the start that he chose Sam because he thought he had the talent to make it.

The Rams selected Sam, the SEC co-defensive player of the year at Missouri, with the 249th overall pick out of 256 overall.

He kissed his boyfriend as a national television audience looked on, and arrived brimming with confidence and with a quick retort for anyone who contended he was in the NFL only because he came out.

The cameras followed, but the extra attention did not seem to faze Sam or his teammates.

Veteran defensive end Chris Long noted rosters are always made up of players from different backgrounds. One by one, players said Sam was now part of their family.

Coach Jeff Fisher called the draft pick a 'second historic moment' for a franchise that signed running back Kenny Washington in 1946 as the league's first black player in the modern era, but he was most interested in describing Sam as a way to upgrade the Rams' defense.

So was general manager Les Snead, who referred to Sam after the draft as a 'designated pass rusher'.

Sam recognized the challenge, so he shed weight to be faster for special teams duty, reporting at 257 pounds.

After the Rams' first preseason game, a 26-24 loss to New Orleans, Fisher said Sam played 'pretty well' but also made his share of mistakes.

Sam, who was credited with one tackle and one quarterback hit in the game, emerged with confidence.

'You know, I can play in this league,' Sam said.

'I can play in this league.'

Sam told his teammates at Missouri that he was gay before his senior year, and judging by the results it was no distraction at all.

Dreams on hold: Sam still has a chance of being picked up by another team, despite being cut by the Rams. The Rams may still choose him for practice squad

The Tigers made a seven-win improvement and tied the school record with 12 wins. Sam had 11 1/2 sacks and the lightly-regarded Tigers won the SEC Eastern Division, a huge step forward after going 5-7 during the first season in their new conference.

More than 100 coaches and players kept the revelation to themselves.

Sam came out in February.

'If you look at our season, it didn't hurt us at all,' recalled cornerback E.J. Gaines, a fellow rookie and former Missouri teammate.

'If anything, it brought us closer.'

Sam was lightly regarded out of Hitchcock, Texas, a town of about 7,000 along the Gulf Coast about 40 miles southeast of Houston.

His first two years at Missouri, Sam backed up Aldon Smith and Jacquies Smith, both of whom are in the NFL.

The Rams drafted Sam even though they didn't need help at defensive end, where they have a pair of first-round picks as starters.

The Rams were so well-stocked with picks, taking 11 players overall, they had leeway to take a shot.

Fisher said Sam's value as a player 'was off the charts'.

'I'm determined to be great,' Sam said at his introductory news conference, packed with reporters.

'I understand that right now you guys want to make a big deal of it.'

From the start, teammates seemed to like having Sam around.

His energy was infectious and, if there were problems, they stayed behind closed doors.

Publicly, Sam was just another late-round pick trying to make the Rams, which, like other NFL teams, held sensitivity training early in camp.

The Oprah Winfrey Network put off a planned documentary on Sam, saying it would allow him to focus on his dream of making the team.

At one point, Sam's Rams jersey was the No. 2 seller among rookies at NFLShop.com, trailing only Cleveland's Johnny Manziel, and Sam was among just 10 draftees selected by the NFL to be featured on commemorative coins.

Sam headed to the ESPY Awards to pick up the Arthur Ashe Courage award. He got a hug from Hall of Famer Jim Brown on his way to the stage and fought back tears throughout his speech.

'Great things can happen when you have the courage to be yourself,' he told the audience.
