Justice: Paula Barnes, 45, who fled Britain after killing a primary school teacher in a road crash. She has has finally been brought to justice, police said

The wife of a drugs 'Mr Big' who fled Britain after killing a primary school teacher in a road crash has finally been brought to justice, police said.

Paula Barnes, 45, of of Baydon, Wiltshire, fled to Holland more than two years ago after being charged with causing death by dangerous driving.

Her husband, David, is serving a 12-year jail term for smuggling £25million of cannabis into the UK from Holland in lorry loads of flowers.

The couple led a lavish lifestyle funded by Mr Barnes’s smuggling operation of importing thousands of kilos of cannabis.

Mrs Barnes was arrested in Holland earlier this month and extradited to the UK where today she admitted killing Diane Wright.

Mrs Wright was killed in a collision in Foxhill, Baydon, near Swindon in September 2010.

The mother-of-two, from Royal Wootton Bassett, worked as a teacher at St Nicholas School in Baydon.

Mrs Barnes, who police describe as a 'callous and manipulative woman', was charged with causing death by driving and bailed to appear at court the following April but failed to show.

She was at large until detectives tracked her down to Holland.

Today at Swindon Crown Court she pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and failing to surrender.

Mrs Barnes has been remanded in custody and is due to be sentenced on January 18.

Inspector Steve Cox, head of roads policing for Wiltshire Police, said: 'Paula Barnes has tried to evade justice by fleeing to Holland where she hoped to remain undetected.

'The fact she was caught, arrested, extradited and has now pleaded guilty to the charge of causing death by dangerous driving is testament to the hard work and dedication of my team.

Criminal: Her husband, David Barnes, is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence for importing cannabis worth £25m into the UK

He added: 'Barnes has proved to be a callous and manipulative woman who thought she was above the law.

'This has been a very long and complex operation which has been led by officers in the serious collision investigation team at Wiltshire Police.

'We hope that today, Dianne’s family can somehow feel that justice has been finally served and at last begin to put this ordeal behind them.'

Swindon Crown and County Court: Barnes will be sentenced in January. Police called her 'callous and manipulative'. File picture
