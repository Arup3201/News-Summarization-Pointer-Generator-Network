Although this stunning picture looks like it is from a holiday brochure for cruises to the sun-soaked Caribbean, it was actually taken in north east England earlier this morning.

The glorious picture was taken by photographer Owen 
Humphreys, who captured the MSC Magnifica cruise ship entering the mouth 
of the River Tyne at sunrise.

Today, the weather is expected to be dry and warm with sunny spells as early mist or fog clears.

Meanwhile, the dry weather provided perfect 
growing conditions for the 160 acres of plants at Vine House Farm in 
Spalding, Lincolnshire - one of the most northerly commercial sunflower 
farms in the world.

But these beautiful sunflowers will not be picked and find their way into someone's living room.

Instead the six billion seeds will be harvested and fed to the birds.

'The sunflowers have really enjoyed the sunny summer weather like us and we are expecting a very good crop,' said Lucy Watts, 35, manager of bird food at the 2,000 acre family-run farm.

'They had a difficult start as we had a cold May and June and they flowered around 10 days later than usual, but they have since flourished in the sun.

'We have had lots of comments from people saying how spectacular they look in the fields.'

Black sunflowers were first planted at the farm in 1998 and a new crop is grown every May.

Once they have flowered they are left to ripen in the fields before they are harvested when the heads turn brown in late September and October.

They are then added to red millet, white millet, naked oats and canary seed, which are also grown on the farm, to create a bird food mix.

It is sent by mail order to homes across the country.

'Black sunflower seeds are bigger and favoured by garden birds,' she added.

'Our bird seed is becoming more and more popular each year as people want to do their bit for the environment and help feed the birds.'

The farm, which offers walks around its sunflower fields now sells around 1,500 tonnes of bird seed a year for around £80,000.

Tonight, any showers across northern and western parts will soon fade leaving most places across the UK dry.

But low cloud, mist and fog is likely across southern parts of the UK. North east England and eastern Scotland will be cloudy with spots of rain.

Tomorrow, fog and low cloud will lift to leave most places dry with warm sunny spells developing especially by the afternoon. Patchy rain in the north east should gradually ease.

Meanwhile weakening bands of cloud and rain will sink south eastwards by Thursday and Friday, but there will be some brighter, warmer weather, especially in south east. It will feel breezy with showers in the north by Saturday and feeling fresh for most.
