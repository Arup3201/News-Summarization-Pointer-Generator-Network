Bayern Munich reject Xherdan Shaqiri looks set to snub Liverpool when he leaves the German giants next year.

The Switzerland midfielder has made only three league starts for Bayern this season, and has long been angling for a move away from the club. 

Liverpool have led the race to sign Shaqiri for over a year - and the player looked set for a move to Anfield in the summer before the Bundesliga champions blocked the move - but new reports suggest that the player is set to join  Wolfsburg.

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers will be disappointed with news of Shaqiri's potential move to Wolfsburg 

However, despite being persuaded to persevere at Bayern, the 23-year-old has still failed to break into the first team and he repeatedly claims to feel undervalued by Pep Guardiola. 'I felt that (former Bayern coach) Jupp Heynckes had more belief in me,' he said recently.

Guardiola himself stated last month that 'if someone wants to leave the club, they can'. Reports in November also revealed that Bayern would allow Shaqiri to leave in January, if a club was willing to pay the £16million asking price.

That may be within Liverpool's budget, but it is also a reasonable demand for Wolfsburg, who are funded almost exclusively by German car manufacturer Volkswagen. 

The links to Volkswagen also set Wolfsburg in good stead when it comes to transfer deals with Bayern, as the company's chairman Martin Winterkorn occupies a seat on the Munich board.

For Shaqiri, though, there is one reason above all why Wolfsburg may be more attractive than Liverpool. The Wolves are flying high in second place in the Bundesliga this season, and are on course for Champions League football next season. Judging by the current situation, it is unlikely Brendan Rodgers' side will be able to offer that perk come next summer.

Shaqiri could join fellow countryman Ricardo Rodriguez at the Volkswagen Arena

Under the clever guidance of coach Dieter Hecking and director of sport Klaus Allofs, Wolfsburg have freed themselves from the legacy of former boss, the Fulham flop Felix Magath, and begun to build a formidable looking side around the likes of Kevin de Bruyne, Ricardo Rodriguez and Ivica Olic.

The relationship between Bayern and Wolfsburg does have a tendency to spoil the transfer plans of Premier League clubs. 

Luiz Gustavo was set to move to Arsenal in 2013 before Wolfsburg swooped on the Brazilian midfielder. In 2011, the then Wolfsburg striker Mario Mandzukic had been linked with Chelsea and Tottenham before he was snapped up by Bayern.

It seems Liverpool may suffer the same fate, particularly if they can't convince Shaqiri that he will be playing Champions League football at Anfield next season.
