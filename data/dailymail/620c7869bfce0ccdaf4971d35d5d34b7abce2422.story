Not quite a cricket score at the home of Scottish rugby but, nonetheless, the kind of emphatic, seemingly effortless victory that Ronny Deila would have coveted so greatly as he made his ‘home’ bow as Celtic manager.

A new boss and an alien venue was a potentially lethal combination for Celtic as they attempted to move closer to a third successive qualification for the group stages. Yet this was as assured a performance as their supporters could have wished for under the circumstances. As a consequence, the new man on the bridge already has a degree of wind in his sails.

Sterner tests undoubtedly lie in wait for the Norwegian and his players in the coming weeks than a Reykjavik side that lacked any semblance of belief they would pull off a highly-improbable aggregate comeback. However, that shouldn’t detract from a proficient, ruthless display by the Scottish champions that hinted at much more to come.

Whether
 it’s Legia Warsaw or St Patrick’s who next roll up in Edinburgh, the 
Murrayfield experience will hold no fears now for Deila’s men. It might 
not be home but nor should it be seen as detrimental to their chances of
 reaching the group stages either.

Last
 night’s perfunctory victory was as much a psychological exercise as a 
physical one. The issue over the stadium and its hybrid surface will 
surely now barely be worthy of a mention when they regroup there in a 
fortnight’s time for what’s likely to be their last visit.

By
 the time they had eased their way into the third qualifying round by a 
combined five-goal margin, all concerns over the switch of venue 
suddenly seemed rather absurd.

Lingering
 worries over the change of manager will naturally remain until more 
arduous hurdles are cleared - but the positivity that has surrounded the
 former Stromgodset man from the first minute he landed in Scotland 
shows no sign of abating.

The
 4-2-3-1 formation his side shaped with a week ago was again in evidence
 and it permitted his side to control the match from the first whistle 
until the last with fluency and zest.

It
 wasn’t the first time Celtic had played a ‘home’ tie in Europe on alien
 territory, although few among the 36,000 crowd would have witnessed the
 famous slaying of Leeds at Hampden in the 1970 European Cup semi-final.

Test: Celtic boss Ronny Deila gets a feel for the pitch at Murrayfield ahead of the game

More
 than 136,000 had descended on Mount Florida that evening – a European 
record that will surely never be broken – and last night’s gathering in 
the east was never likely to attract more than a fraction of that 
number.

Celtic did their 
level best to replicate the feel of Parkhead in a stadium with 7,000 
more seats than their spiritual home. They made a decent fist of it with
 hundreds of latecomers rushing from the Murrayfield hostelries to 
applaud Deila as he took his place on the bench for the first time in a 
competitive game in Scotland as Celtic manager.

There
 would be no quibble with the welcome afforded by their hosts. The 
Scottish Rugby Union had promised a newly-laid surface fit for a 
Champions League qualifier and it was that and then some. A combination 
of grass and synthetic fibres, Murrayfield might well have made a late 
entry to host the lawn bowls at the Commonwealth Games.

It
 was tailor-made for the high-intensity, passing game championed by 
Deila. The wide expanses were a source of torment for a Reykjavik side 
who had just about kept themselves in the tie a week ago with a compact,
 diligent display on home soil.

The
 clicking of mobile phone cameras among the Icelandic players as they 
inspected the turf in their suits pre-match was a subtle indication that
 their ambitions didn’t stretch far beyond savouring the occasion.

Within
 half an hour, already three goals down on the night, you suspected the 
visitors had already had enough of sight-seeing in the capital.

Teemu
 Pukki ought to have beaten Stefan Magnusson when one-on-one inside five
 minutes but Virgil van Dijk’s six-minute brace – with both goals 
springing from corners - rendered that irrelevant.

Pukki’s
 second near thing of the evening was more down to the agility of the 
visiting keeper than the Finn’s shortcomings but commendably he was on 
hand to sweep home his side’s third moments later following Callum 
McGregor’s cut-back.

With 
the match over as a contest long before Latvian referee Andris Treimanis
 brought the first half to a close, there was a degree of inevitability 
about Deila’s men easing off a fraction in the second period.

Kris Commons twice menaced Magnusson with vicious efforts from distance that the KR keeper did well to parry.

On
 a night of seemingly boundless positives, Deila was able to hand both 
Beram Kayal and Adam Matthews half an hour each while Liam Henderson 
enjoyed the last 18.

Henderson
 oddly arrived on the scene to a chorus of good-natured boos – the 
reason being that Pukki was going the other way at the same time seconds
 after side-stepping Magnusson to clinically claim his second and his 
side’s fourth. You sense the naysayers might just forgive their new 
leader, however.
