If the simple slingshot is just not dangerous enough for you, an aerospace engineer from Texas has created one so powerful it can kill a wild animal.

The Standard Survival Slingshot is fitted with two mounting points and comes with 40 rounds of steel shot.

While the Archer model takes it up a notch, letting the user fire arrows from the foldable weapon.

The Survival Slingshot was designed by an aerospace engineer from Texas. The standard model is fitted with a compass and two standard mounting points that shoot metal slingshot balls for $49.95 (£30)

Its rail system allows it to hold an included flashlight, as well as a range of attachments such as a compass.

There is also a waterproof storage area to help deal with more challenging situations.

The company, whose motto is ‘bring a tool, not a toy,’ says the Survival Slingshot is configured for archery as well as night time hunting.

The ring mounted atop the slingshot is something known as a ‘whisker biscuit’.

A whisker biscuit is an arrow rest with synthetic bristles and a hole in the centre.

This particular one features bristles that point inwards to help guide and steady an arrow as it’s launched to hit larger targets.

The company adds that it can be removed for firing more traditional slingshot ammo like metal ball bearings.

The Archer Complete model costs $139.95 (£85) and can also shoot arrows.

The standard model, which fires slingshot balls, costs $49.95 (£30) and can be brought from the company’s website.
