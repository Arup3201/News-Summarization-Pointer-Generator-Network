Chelsea will be refereed by Mike Dean for the first time since Jose Mourinho blasted him after a defeat by Sunderland.

Dean will take charge of the Blues' testing trip to Manchester City, where they look to extend their lead at the top of the Premier League.

But there will be no love lost between Mourinho and Dean after Chelsea's 2-1 loss at the tail end of last season.

Dean awarded a penalty against Cesar Azpilicueta for a challenge on Jozy Altidore, with Fabio Borini tucking home from the spot to end Mourinho's unblemished home record.

He then sent Blues assistant boss Rui Faria to the stands after Faria protested the decision furiously.

Mourinho sarcastically congratulated the officials after the match, when at the time it looked like Liverpool would win the title.

Mourinho said aftet the April clash: ‘The first [point] is to congratulate my players. They did everything they could, playing from the first minute to the last seconds, and deserved that. Sometimes we praise the players when we win. I think it’s fair to praise my players after the defeat.

‘Secondly, congratulations to Sunderland. It doesn’t matter how, why or in which way they won, they won. They won three fantastic points. I think it’s also fair to congratulate them.

‘Third point, I want to congratulate again Mike Dean. I think his performance was unbelievable and I think when referees have unbelievable performances, I think it’s fair that as managers we give them praise. So, fantastic performance. He came here with one objective. To make a fantastic performance. And he did that.

‘And fourth, congratulations also to Mike Riley, the referees’ boss. What they are doing through the whole season is fantastic, especially in the last couple of months, and in teams involved in the title race. Absolutely fantastic.’

Mourinho was later fined £10,000 by the Football Association, but insists he has no issue with Dean, or referees’ chief Mike Riley.
