Foul play: Annette McCullough, 18, attacked a rival soccer play after she was tripped during a match in Lewisville, South Carolina

An amateur video shot by a spectator showed McCullough, who attends Lewisville High in Richburg, falling to the ground after it appeared she had her heels clipped by one of the opposition.

A woman at the side of park and another player run over to try to stop the frenzied attack by the teen girl.

McCullough was shown a red card by the referee and then escorted from the park.

Chester County Sheriff Richard Smith told WBTV that McCullough has been charged with third-degree assault and battery after they had watch the footage of the attack.

The Sheriff's report said the 
victim, who has not been identified, had several 'swollen knots behind her right ear' and a mark on 
her neck but was not bleeding.

The victim's mother said she would be taking her daughter for tests following the attack and believed McCullough should be prosecuted and banned from the school league.

Referee Alan Parker, who had to walk the enraged girl from the pitch, told WECT: 'Contact is a part of soccer, but when you retaliate like that, obviously, there is no place in the game for that.'
