Greg Dyke has branded England’s opening World Cup encounter with Italy as the game from hell for Roy Hodgson’s side.

While the FA chairman stopped short of publicly declaring that Hodgson’s job is safe whatever happens here in Brazil, he did stress how difficult a group England face.

At the draw last December Dyke memorably made a throat-cutting gesture when England found themselves in the same group as Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica, and he was reminded of that yesterday. VIDEO: Scroll down for FA chairman Greg Dyke makes a throat-slitting gesture

‘The gesture was a joke,’ he said. ‘But we sat there and said there were two things we didn’t want. We didn’t want Italy and we didn’t want Manaus, and we got both!’

In the past Dyke has said Hodgson’s job is safe irrespective of England’s results. That his contract runs until Euro 2016 in France and that he will continue in charge until then. Indeed Alex Horne, the FA general secretary, has said the same.

On Tuesday, Dyke would not quite commit to that position.

‘I’ve got a lot of time for Roy,’ he said. ‘I’m a big fan.’ 

But asked if Hodgson would remain England manager regardless of what happens, Dyke said: ‘Well who knows? He’s contracted to.

‘We wouldn’t want to discuss what happens to him afterwards because this is the moment when things should be going well. So it’s not appropriate to discuss that now. But I’m a big fan of Roy’s.

‘I would say we would obviously hope to get out of the group and then after that…

‘But it’s a tough group. I think one of the reasons we are coming here with less expectation is because it’s such a tough group. I was looking at the French group the other day. If the French don’t get out of their group I think they will be committing suicide.’

The French might not appreciate the sentiment and Dyke’s take on Brazil as hosts could offend the hosts. Even if what he said had a ring of truth about it. 

‘What I’m surprised about this city is the fact that you wouldn’t know there is a World Cup going on,’ he said. 

‘I’m told there’s all sorts of politics. There is real concern about the protesters. Some people don’t want Brazil to win because they don’t want the government to get re-elected.  

‘The only reason you’d know there’s a World Cup here is because half the people are on strike and you can’t get from the airport. 

‘The people I’ve been talking to are of the view that it’s very quiet. It does bring up the question for the future, because clearly there are a lot of people in this country who think too much money has been spent when there are extremes of poverty.’
