Rabbi Hyman Steinberg, 82, was fatally injured by driver Simon Martins, 24, who later pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving at Manchester Crown Court

Relatives of a grandfather killed by a speeding motorist have criticised celebrity lawyer Nick Freeman – better known as Mr Loophole – for saying the victim ought to have been wearing more brightly coloured clothes.

The 82-year-old Rabbi Hyman Steinberg was killed by motorist Simon Martins who had just sent a text message and had been doing 42mph in a 30mph zone.

But Martins escaped a prison sentence for killing the rabbi after Mr Freeman argued that the victim should ‘assume some responsibility’ because he was not wearing highly visible clothing.

Last night Rabbi Steinberg’s disgusted family said that it wouldn’t have made any difference if had been festooned in ‘pink, white and blue flashing lights’ because he was practically on the pavement when he was mown down.

Mr Freeman, a high-profile solicitor known as ‘Mr Loophole’, has won acquittals for celebrity clients including Sir Alex Ferguson, David Beckham, Jeremy Clarkson and Colin Montgomerie.

But he has been criticised for his ‘sharp practice’ by a High Court judge while other critics accuse him of exploiting gaps in the rules to help offenders escape justice.

Mr Freeman told the court Rabbi Steinberg would have been been ‘invisible’ on the rainy winter’s night due to his traditional all-black orthodox Jewish clothing.

He added that pedestrians like him would be safer if they wore ‘something reflective that would give them a visible presence, such as a vest, armbands or belt’.

Mr Freeman said: ‘Pedestrians along with motorists and cyclists all share road space, and in my view therefore must assume some responsibility to ensure their visibility.

‘Sadly, because he was “invisible”, Mr Steinberg has lost his life.’

However his comments were yesterday labelled ‘nonsense’ by the rabbi’s son-in-law, 63-year-old Cyril Rose, who added he had been shocked driver Simon Martins hadn’t been jailed.

‘What Mr Freeman has said is ridiculous and insensitive,’ said Mr Rose, who is himself a solicitor and witnessed the collision.

‘Had my father-in-law been wearing pink, white and blue flashing lights, it would not have made the slightest bit of difference because he was practically on the pavement and he still got hit. The driver was just driving carelessly.

‘I’m sure when Mr Freeman goes to court each day he wears a blue or black suit. Does he wear reflective clothing?’

Rabbi Steinberg had been walking to his local synagogue in Whitefield, Greater Manchester in December 2012 and had ‘almost got to the pavement’ when he was hit and flung into the air, Manchester Crown Court was told this week.

Martins, 24, had been doing up to 42mph on a 30mph road and had sent a text message from behind the wheel just minutes before he hit the rabbi, who had 54 grandchildren.

He claimed he had not seen Rabbi Steinberg in his black hat, black suit and black overcoat until it was too late, and was said to be ‘haunted’ by his death.

Martins – who had been blessed by Rabbi Steinberg’s brother as a baby - was given an eight-month suspended prison sentence and ordered to complete 300 hours’ community service, with a 15-month driving ban, after admitting causing death by careless driving.

Afterwards Mr Freeman said he wasn’t suggesting ‘everyone must wear a hi-viz jacket’ but that pedestrians could do more to protect themselves at night.Mr Rose added: ‘I expected the driver to go down for a few years as a deterrent for others, I am surprised by this sentence.’

Tributes have been paid to Rabbi Steinberg of Broughton by the area’s large Jewish community.

Lib Dem transport spokesman John Leech – MP for the Manchester constituency of Withington – is now calling for the sentence to be reviewed, saying it set a ‘dangerous precedent’.

And he criticised Mr Freeman’s comments, saying: ‘As well as being culturally insensitive, the incident was clearly the fault of the speeding driver.’

But the solicitor hit back, accusing the politician of political point-scoring and saying ministers should do more to encourage pedestrians to make themselves visible at night.

‘My comments are pertinent to men and women of all colours and creeds, and in case he is not aware I too am Jewish, so I’m hardly likely to denigrate my own culture,’ Mr Freeman added.
