Miley Cyrus is no stranger to straddling that fine line between good and bad taste... nor indeed to internet mockery.

But have you ever seen her astride a 
Russian space rocket, riding a dolphin or hitching a lift on Steve 
McQueen's motorcycle - completely naked but for a pair of Dr Martens boots?

The former Disney star, 20, has again become the source of fun for internet pranksters who have mocked up a series of pictures of her straddling a variety of animals and famous landmarks.

Scroll down for video.

Crest of a wave: Miley Cyrus has been the source of so many internet memes in recent months it is becoming increasingly difficult to switch on a computer and not be confronted by her face... or indeed some other body part

Eiffel taste! Internet pranksters have mocked up a series of pictures of her wearing nothing but a pair of Doctor Marten boots while straddling a variety of animals and objects, including Paris' iconic Eiffel Tower

The Great Escape: This mock up sees the former Disney starlet hitching a lift on the back of Steve McQueen's motorcycle as he attempts to flee a German prisoner of war camp in the film The Great Escape

The pictures, which have gone viral, were created using a still of her latest music video, Wrecking Ball, which sees the former Disney star writhing naked on a building site and licking a sledgehammer.

The pictures also include the controversial popstar riding a dolphin, the Eiffel Tower and the Statue of Liberty.

It comes days after the music video, directed by US photographer Terry Richardson, overtook that of One Direction's Best Song Ever to be crowned the most played video on Vevo in a single day.

In the first 24 hours of its release on Monday, the video was viewed a staggering 19.1million times. By the time of writing it had reached over 70 million views in four days.

The video comes after Miley's now infamous VMA performance, which saw her parade around in a bra and knickers, whilst twerking (again) and performing some other obscure movements with a foam finger.

In an an interview with MTV, the daughter of country singer Billy Ray Cyrus compared herself to Madonna and Britney Spears, who also made headlines when they locked lips during a passionate on air kiss 10 years ago at the 2003 VMAs, and she's likely to have some tricks under her belt for her first hosting gig in Saturday Night Live on October 5.

Miley confirmed she'll head up the landmark show and will also perform. Katy Perry will take the baton a week later on the 12th.

Miley - who is currently in Amsterdam - has been very busy in Europe promoting her fourth album, which is her first album with her new punk look and attitude, which is quite the 180 from the Country Bumpkin image she used to fuel her teenage career.

On Saturday she spanked a Twerking dwarf as she sang We Can't Stop on German TV.

Bangerz will be release on October 8 and the album will reportedly feature a collaboration between Miley and Britney Spears.
