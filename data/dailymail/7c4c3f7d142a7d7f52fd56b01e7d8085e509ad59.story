A 24-year-old woman has been arrested for buying the assault rifle used to murder two innocent firefighters on Christmas Eve, on behalf of the killer.

Dawn Nguyen of Rochester, New York, was a former neighbor of William Spengler, 62, who shot dead firefighters Michael Chiapperini and Tomasz Kaczowka in a shocking ambush as they responded to a house fire he started early Monday morning. Three other people were wounded before Spengler killed himself.

According to police, Nguyen purchased the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and a 12-gauge shotgun on behalf of Spengler, a convicted felon who was barred from possessing weapons, on June 6, 2010.Â 

Accessory: Dawn Nguyen, 24, pictured centre, is charged in connection with the guns used in the Christmas Eve ambush slaying of two volunteer firefighters

Spengler is believed to have picked out the weapons himself at a firearm store in Henrietta, New York.

The young woman faces a federal charge of knowingly making a false statement, U.S. Attorney William Hochul said, and is also charged with a state count of filing a falsified business record.

The gunman also had a .38-caliber revolver in his possession on the day of the shootings, but Nguyen is not connected to that gun. Police used the serial numbers on the weapons to trace them to Nguyen.

Killer: William Spengler had previously served 17 years in prison for killing his elderly grandmother

'She told the seller of these guns, Gander Mountain in Henrietta, N.Y., that she was to be the true owner and buyer of the guns instead of William Spengler,' Hochul said.

'It is absolutely against federal law to provide any materially false information related to the acquisition of firearms.'

During an interview late on Christmas Eve, Nguyen told police she had bought the guns for personal protection and that they were stolen from her vehicle, though she never reported the guns stolen.

The day after the shootings, however,
Nguyen texted an off-duty Monroe County Sheriff's deputy with 
references to the killings and later admitted to him that she bought the
guns for Spengler.

Police said that information was consistent with a suicide note found near Spengler's body after he killed himself.

The .223-caliber Bushmaster rifle, 
which had a combat-style flash suppressor, is similar to the one Adam 
Lanza used to shoot dead 20 children and six female staff at Sandy Hook 
Elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, earlier this month.

Nguyen and her mother, Dawn Welsher, 
lived next door to Spengler in 2008 - when Nguyen was just 20 years old.

On Wednesday and again on Friday, shortly before her arrest, she 
answered her cellphone and told The Associated Press that she didn't 
want to talk about Spengler.

Her brother, Steven Nguyen, told the 
Democrat and Chronicle newspaper of Rochester that Spengler stole the 
guns from Dawn Nguyen.

Spengler set a car on fire and 
touched off an inferno in his Webster home on a strip of land along the 
Lake Ontario shore, took up a sniper's position and opened fire on the 
first firefighters to arrive at about 5:30am on Christmas Eve, 
authorities said. He wounded two other firefighters and an off-duty 
police officer who was on his way to work.

A Webster police officer who had 
accompanied the firefighters shot back at Spengler with a rifle in a 
brief exchange of gunfire before the gunman killed himself.

Spengler spent 17 years in prison for
killing his grandmother in 1980. His neighbors said he confessed his 
criminal past within 15 minutes of them meeting, and even pointed to the
staircase where he committed the crime.

'He said, "I was on drugs and I 
wanted money for drugs and my grandmother wouldn't give it to me,"' Amy 
Warner, who bought the cottage next to Spengler's home with her 
boyfriend this summer, told New York Magazine.

She said they tore out the staircase 
'because it was creepy,' but didn't think twice about buying the house 
because Spengler had served his time. Her home was one of seven destroyed by the fire Spengler started.

Investigators still haven't released the identity of remains found in William Spengler's burned house. They have said they believe the remains are those of his 67-year-old sister, Cheryl Spengler, who also lived in the house near Rochester and has been unaccounted for since the killings.

The Spengler siblings had lived in the home with their mother, Arline Spengler, who died in October. Police found a rambling, typed letter laying out Spengler's intention to destroy his neighborhood and 'do what I like doing best, killing people.'

He had been released from parole in 2006 on the manslaughter conviction, and authorities said they had had no encounters with him since.

Nguyen faces a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, a fine of $250,000 or both.
