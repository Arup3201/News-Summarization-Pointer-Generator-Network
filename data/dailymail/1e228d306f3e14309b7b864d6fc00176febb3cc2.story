George Osborne faces calls to slash Capital Gains Tax as a report shows past increases have failed to create revenue.

Official figures examined by the Adam Smith Institute show putting up the tax in 2010 actually cost the Treasury income.

Its report finds people held on to assets – such as property or shares – rather than selling them, to avoid the higher tax rate.

Osborne raised CGT from 18 per cent to 28 per cent for most taxpayers in June 2010, nearly three months into the tax year. This unusual timing means the impact of the change can be easily measured.

Figures from HM Revenue & Customs show a 76 per cent drop in transactions that attract CGT, and a 64 per cent reduction in tax paid.

If the new regime had run for a full year the amount raised by the levy would have plunged from £6.9billion to £2.5billion.

‘Clearly, many people sought to realise 
gains before the rate increased, knowing that the Coalition Agreement 
committed the Government to a sharp increase in CGT rate,’ the report 
says.

‘CGT is effectively a voluntary tax, paid
only when people choose to dispose of assets. If they perceive rates to
be too high, they choose to keep assets.

Wales could bring in a lower tax band for the middle classes to attract business.

The Treasury is said to support calls for the Welsh Assembly to be able to vary tax rates.

Welsh Tories would use the powers to 
cut tax for the middle 40 per cent band - but they are unlikely to win 
control of the Labour and Plaid Cymru-dominated Assembly.

‘The Adam Smith Institute is urging the Government to slash CGT rates to pre-2010 levels, which would raise more revenue for the Treasury and also stimulate growth.’

While CGT receipts have increased since 2011, the think-tank insists they would be far higher if the rate had stayed the same.

The report fuelled calls by Tory MPs including Adam Afriyie and Brian Binley for the Chancellor to slash taxes in the Budget next month.

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘In 2010 the Government introduced a higher rate of Capital Gains Tax to reduce the incentives to substitute income for a capital gain to avoid income tax, a practice that was costing other taxpayers up to £1billion a year.’
