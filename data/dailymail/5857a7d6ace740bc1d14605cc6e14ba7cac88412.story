Anger: A photo by 'Sophie Wittams' was in fact of unsuspecting Charlene Tyler, from Lincolnshire

A Tory MP plans to make a formal complaint over allegations of 'entrapment' against a newspaper that forced Brooks Newmark to resign as a minister for sending an explicit photograph of himself. 

Mark Pritchard said the story could be a test case for the new press regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation.

Charities Minister Mr Newmark was forced to quit after allegedly sending a picture of himself wearing Paisley pyjamas to a journalist, masquerading as 'Sophie Wittams', via the instant messaging app Whatsapp.

Mr Newmark admitted: 'I have been a complete fool.'

However, lawyers and media commentators questioned whether there was a public interest in using subterfuge to get the Tory MP to exchange explicit images with an undercover reporter, who was working for the Sunday Mirror.

Some even suggested that the paper may have committed a criminal offence by ‘tricking’ Mr Newmark into sexual activity.  

A male journalist working for the Sunday Mirror set up a fake Twitter account in the name of Sophie Wittams, supposedly a pretty blonde in her 20s working in PR.

‘Sophie’ described herself as a ‘twenty-something Tory PR girl’ in London, and her flirty and flattering tweets attracted the attention of several Tory MPs – including married minister Mr Newmark. 

Fellow Tory MP, Mr Pritchard, said on Twitter he would be referring the story to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), which recently replaced the Press Complaints Commission.

He told his 3,200 Twitter followers: "Test case for IPSO Will be making formal complaint over attempted entrapment by Mirror."

Speaking to the BBC, he said: "It is in the public interest that their actions are fully investigated. This is the first real test as to whether the new body, Ipso, has any teeth."

Tthe Sunday Mirror said the story was in the public interest.

Alison Phillips, Mirror weekend editor, told the Guardian: "This investigation was brought to the Sunday Mirror by a freelance reporter.

'The investigation, which had a clear public interest, was carried out following information from a reliable source."

IPSO's code of practice states editors must justify intrusions into people’s private lives, including when using digital communications.

It adds: ‘Engaging in misrepresentation or subterfuge, including by agents or intermediaries, can generally be justified only in the public interest and then only when the material cannot be obtained by other means.’

Charlotte Harris, media lawyer at Mishcon de Reya, said: ‘I think many members of the public reading the Sunday Mirror story will consider that it does amount to entrapment – particularly if you look at when the story has been used.’

And criminal barrister Matthew Scott wrote on his blog yesterday: ‘What conceivable public interest was served by tricking Mr Newmark in this way?'

Lloyd Embley, editor-in-chief of the Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror, defended the story after former BBC journalist Sue Llewellyn claimed it was ‘unethical’. He tweeted: ‘1) it wasn’t a Mirror sting 2) there’s a nailed-on public interest.’ 

The pictures of ‘Sophie’ on the account appear to have simply been taken from the internet.

They show at least two different women – one an unsuspecting young woman from Lincolnshire and the other a blonde model from Sweden, who yesterday made furious claims she had been ‘exploited’. 

Although the name Sophie Wittams was selected for the account, it bears no connection to any real person with that name.

Alluring: This picture of 'Miss Wittam's' legs - actually Miss Tyler's - was used as the journalist encouraged Mr Newmark to send explicit images. Miss Tyler said the MP had nothing to be ashamed of and should not resign

However, the bogus profile was still enough to persuade the married Tory minister he was chatting to a young woman – a conversation which culminated in him sending an X-rated photo. The journalist also tried to charm a series of Conservative politicians as ‘Miss Wittams’ – and a number replied.

‘She’ described newly-elected Newark MP Robert Jenrick, 32, as a ‘fitty’, and called housing minister Brandon Lewis, 43, a ‘legend’.

The reporter also tried to flirt with Tory MP Charlie Elphicke, 43, after he posted a picture of himself with two dogs at a pet shop in his Dover constituency – although the MP simply acknowledged it with a polite reply.

Other Tory politicians lauded by ‘Miss Wittams’ included Dan Byles, 40, Mark Pritchard, 47, and Nick de Bois, 55.

The journalist also used the account to tweet about boozy work nights out, sunbathing and sport as well as Conservative policies. There is no suggestion that any MP apart from Mr Newmark behaved inappropriately or sent any explicit material.

The fake Twitter profile was set up in May and has now been deleted.

Its profile photograph was yesterday revealed to be Swedish model Malin Sahlen, 22, who last night said it was ‘offensive’ to use her image without permission. 

'‘I have had a lot of emails, texts and phonecalls from different countries about it. It feels unreal,’ she tells Aftonbladet.

‘I do not want to be used this way and that someone has used my picture this way feels so horrible, both for me and others involved in this.’

On her blog she writes: ‘I feel very confused right now and still can’t comprehend that what has happened has happened. I can blog more about this another day, but right now I can’t bare to talk about it.’  

Enticing: The Twitter profile picture of 'Sophie Wittams', who is really a Swedish model uninvolved in the sting. Malin Sahlen, 22, last night said it was ‘offensive’ to use her image without permission

‘This thing feels really unpleasant.’

The undercover reporter also used another enticing picture from a young British woman’s Twitter page as part of the deception.

During the summer heatwave, ‘Miss Wittams’ tweeted ‘Cheeky early finish on a Friday #lappingupthesun’.

It was illustrated with a selfie of a woman’s tanned legs, which was taken from a tweet sent the previous day by Charlene Tyler, 26, from Boston, Lincolnshire.

Miss Tyler told the Daily Telegraph she was upset that the Mirror had hijacked her photo for use in its sting. She said Mr Newmark had nothing to be ashamed of and should have felt no need to resign.

'I think grown adults can do whatever they like as long as both of them are over the age of consent,' she said, adding that she hoped Mr Newmark was okay and revealing she felt 'awful' about her unwitting role in his downfall.

Disgraced: Brooks Newmark with his wife Lucy, just after he was elected MP for Braintree in 2005

'The fact that a newspaper was stealing my photograph is quite wrong. The newspaper’s taken it too far,' she said of the Mirror reporter's use of her photograph.

The main focus of the journalist’s investigation appears to have been Mr Newmark, 56.

‘Miss Wittams’ retweeted several of his postings, which covered everything from a concert by The Eagles to a briefing by charities about their work in Rwanda.

She wrote ‘haha!’ when the MP complained about people phoning him during the Wimbledon men’s final in July.

When Mr Newmark posted a picture of himself with a dog called ‘Mrs Thatcher’ at a fete in his Braintree constituency, she commented: ‘Aww!’

Only one of Mr Newmark’s replies to ‘Miss Wittams’ survives. On June 15 he simply wrote: ‘delighted!’
