A kayaker held his nerve to capture the moment a 20ft minke whale came within arm's reach beneath the water.

Andrew Peacock, a doctor, was working on a three-week expedition on a yacht in the Antarctic Peninsula when he spotted the magnificent mammal gliding through the water below.

Later, while kayaking, Dr Peacock got a closer look when the creature swam up to inspect the red-bottomed hull of his vessel.

Dr Peacock, seen in Paradise Harbour in the Antarctic Peninsula, had spotted the whale earlier from his expedition's yacht

The quick-thinking medic grabbed his Canon DSLR camera from a bag on his chest harness to preserve the memory on film.

'I was awestruck to be in such close proximity to such a beautiful, elegant ocean mammal,' Dr Peacock said.

'Being in a kayak made the encounter seem that much more personal.

'Initially I didn't trust that the whale could detect the exact boundaries of my kayak.

'I was certainly feeling vulnerable and quite nervous that I could end up in the freezing water.'

The shots joined his collection of the icy scenery and wildlife from the Antarctic tour.

Antarctic minke whales are not known for being particularly social, keeping to small groups of about two to four.

The whale came close to the kayaks to inspect the colourful hulls, which was unusual behaviour for the breed

The doctor had a bag strapped to his chest harness with his camera equipment, allowing him to record sights from the view of his kayak

Despite weighing up to nine tonnes, 
they are considered small by whale standards. They use their beaks poke 
holes in the pack ice of the Antarctic.

'I took a simple but risky approach,' Dr Peacock said.

'With no waterproof protection for this expensive equipment I was as careful as possible.'

The 45-year-old said he often combines his love for rock climbing, mountaineering and kayaking with his medical skills as a tour guide.

The doctor, from Queensland, Australia, has practised medicine in ten countries and previously led kayak tours off the coast of San Francisco.

He said: 'One has to accept that you're only really useful in case of an emergency.

'I enjoy expedition medical trips best when I can play another role.'
