A supercar fanatic fed up with missing out on offers of dates from women who spotted him diriving his Ferrari F430 has launched an app that he hopes will be the key to revving up Britain's sex lives.

Marc Ackerley found himself swamped with date requests from attractive women who caught sight of him behind the wheel of his £170,000 Ferrarri.

Women were apparently so desperate to meet him that they contacted a local luxury car dealer to be put in touch with the owner.

Marc Ackerley (R) with Lawrence Cookson (L), who
 developed the app, was fed up with missing out on offers of dates so 
created a way of tracking someone down via their car registration

Fuelled by this new-found female attention and his worry that he was missing out on offers from women who had admired him (and his car) from afar but wouldn't think of contacting a car dealership, the businessman set up Platewave.

The app which allows admirers to contact any car owner in the country. All you do is sign up to the website or app and send a message or a 'wave' to any registration plate.

The recipient can only see it if they sign up to the app themselves and when they do, their messages will be waiting for them.

Marc, from Alderley Edge, Cheshire, said: 'I started getting phone calls from my car dealer, asking if I had been out that day in my Ferrari. He told me that he'd had a number of calls from ladies who had spotted me driving my car and wanted to go out for a drink with me.

Supercar heartthrob: Marc's car dealer was swamped with date requests from attractive women who spotted Marc driving around in his £170,000 Ferrarri F430 so he looked for a way to help them find him

'And it got me thinking, what were the chances that other people had spotted me but didn't know how to track me down, or didn't think to contact me through my dealer.

'Or what if I had only been in the area on business, and lived elsewhere. How would they find me?

'The odds are stacked against me ever getting those messages or those women ever finding me - so I started to think about how I could make it easier for people to get in touch. This is the 21st century, it shouldn't be that difficult.'

Motor-mad stud? Sign up for free and find love, says Marc of his new app

Light bulb moment: Fuelled by his new-found female attention and annoyance of always missing their offers, the entrepreneur set up Platewave

That's clever! The app allows admirers to contact any car owner in the country

So the 58-year-old entrepreneur launched the Platewave website, followed by mobile apps which allow people to connect with potential partners almost instantly.

Marc added: 'Every penny people spend on a car, over what they need, is a statement, a way of standing out from the crowd.

'No one needs a flashy car, but we buy them to attract attention and if it's a really nice car, then people will stop and take an extra look.

'People always go for the very best that is available to them - it's just a fact of life that money attracts people.

'But if I saw the world's fittest woman getting into a battered old fiesta, I would hardly care what car she was driving.

Not just for attracting love: Marc says there are many other uses for it, such as seeing a dog in distress in a hot car, and you want to text the owner to let them know

'Dating sites are renowned for people putting up old pictures, and it can always be a disappointment when you meet someone and they look nothing like that anymore.

'But if you have just seen someone getting into their car, you know exactly who you are messaging.'

And despite its obvious benefits as a tool for singletons to track down lovers, Marc insists the app can be used for a whole host of reasons.

He added: 'There are so many uses for it - it can be whatever you want it to be. The amazing thing about it is that it gives you a way to connect instantly with someone, you never know who you're going to see or what car they might be driving.

The new Tinder? Marx thinks dating sites are renowned for people putting up old pictures but his app won't disappoint, he promises

'But if something interesting happens, then Platewave gives you a way to get in touch.

'You might have seen someone driving a car you like, and want to get in touch. Or imagine it's a hot summer's day and you can see a dog in distress in a hot car, and you want to text the owner to let them know.

'I think it could be a really big thing - the possibilities are endless.'
