A massive wildfire burning out of 
control across south-east Australia has now become so fierce it is 
'creating its own weather', triggering lightning and 
spot fires.

The extreme 
heat and high winds fanned dozens of bushfires, prompting hundreds to 
flee their homes in some of the worst conditions seen since Black 
Saturday in 2009.

One person
 died in the Grampians bushland in the southeastern state of Victoria, 
about 300 km (186 miles) west of Melbourne, where bushfires are burning 
out of control amid temperatures which have hit above 40 degrees Celsius
 (104 degrees F), destroying or damaging houses.

Victoria Fire Services Commissioner 
Craig Lapsley said conditions were 'up there' as the worst since the 
Black Saturday fires that killed 173 people in 2009.

Lapsley
 said the 21,000-hectare (81-sq-mile) fire in the Grampians bushland was
 so intense it had 'created its own weather'.

Strong wind changes and thunderstorms forecast for later Friday could exacerbate conditions, he said.

Victoria
 was the hardest hit, with 70 bushfires burning out of control. Dozens 
of blazes are burning in South Australia, Western Australia and New 
South Wales.

Authorities
 have issued seven emergency warnings to severely affected areas, 
prompting hundreds of residents to flee their homes.

Yesterday, a maximum temperature of 46.4C was recorded in Roseworthy, a town on the outskirts of Adelaide - which itself hit 44C - according to the Bureau of Meteorology.

Meanwhile, temperatures in Melbourne could reach the 44C mark today, while Adelaide is expected to cool slightly. So far today, the maximum recorded temperature has been 42.3C.

The Black Saturday bushfires of February 2009 saw 173 people killed and 414 injured as a result of blazes.

Around 400 individual fires were recorded in the Victoria area of Australia on February 7.

The worst bushfire conditions on record were experienced as temperatures reached 46C.

This, combined with winds of more than 62mph, caused devastation.

Black Saturday took place after almost two months of little or no rain in the area.Some 173 people were killed – including 120 from one single blaze – and more than 2,000 houses and 3,500 structures were destroyed.

Residents in the path of more than 100 devastating bushfires in Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales were ordered to leave their homes immediately today - but at least one person, who stayed behind at their home in Wartook, Victoria, has died in the flames.

The death comes as more than 200 others have been admitted to hospitals in South Australia for heat-related conditions.

According
 to Adelaide Now, 90 people were admitted to hospitals in South 
Australia yesterday alone – including 65 in and around the city.

Although temperatures cooled slightly today, the Adelaide, Canberra and Melbourne areas were all expected to top 40C.

In Victoria, there are thought to be more than 40 fires burning out of control. In total, more than 70 have been recorded in the area.

In New South Wales, meanwhile, there are reported to be almost 50 blazes, with 12 out of control. In South Australia, there are 19 blazes, according to ABC.

In
 Victoria, the state has estimated that fire conditions could be the 
worst experienced since Black Saturday, when 173 people died in 2009.

Fire crews and police - who said 12 fires burning in South Australia had been deliberately lit - ordered those with a chance of escaping the flames to evacuate their homes immediately. Those who had left it too late were told to stay inside.

But many residents who were told there was still time to flee the flames said they would stay and try to defend their homes from the walls of fire and the burning embers that were flying from the blazes.

The biggest fears are for residents and homes in the Northern Grampians, a hilly wine-producing region west of Melbourne which is steeped in Aboriginal history.

Even though the Country Fire Authority warned that a 'fast moving and out-of-control' bushfire was heading to the Brimpaen area in the Grampians many residents decided to stay and try to tackle the fire.

Fire superintendent Graham Kent urged residents in the communities of Halls Gap and Dadswells Bridge to evacuate. 'The emergency services' primary mission is to preserve life,' he told a community meeting in Dadswells Bridge today.

Emergency text messages were being 
sent out to warn people of the approaching dangers, but not all the 
messages were getting through, said police, because of reception 
difficulties.

Motel 
owners Stephen and Peggy Odgers of Halls Gap said they would stay and 
defend the Kookaburra Motor Lodge which they have owned for three years.

The Adelaide heatwave has been affecting wildlife as well as humans, and nearly 100 flying foxes have been reported dead around the city’s botanic park.

And, according to ABC, experts have predicted that more of the bats, exhausted in the conditions, will die.

The 90 confirmed dead make up around a tenth of the colony in the area. Around 100 died of heat stress in Adelaide’s parklands.

Last week, around 100,000 bats died as a result of the heatwave in Queensland.

'All of our guests have left and bookings have been cancelled,' said Mr Odgers, 'but most of our neighbours will be ignoring the recommendation to evacuate.'

One fire in the Northern Grampians was over 11,000 hectares, swallowing up everything in its path.

Throughout the afternoon today warnings were issued to dozens of small communities in the path of the fires.

And health officials said that people living nowhere near bushland should not assume they were immune from ill-effects. Officials said that people living hundreds of miles from a bushfire could be affected by smoke, especially if they suffered from a pre-existing heart or lung condition.

The fires have erupted through a number of factors - the extreme heatwave striking the south east corner of Australia, lightning strikes and the cruel activities of arsonists.

A fire burning in Gippsland, a region to the east of Melbourne, could soon be covering more than 500,000 hectares, fire officials fear. The notorious 'bushfire season' in Australia has once again turned the sky red and sent plumes of black smoke over towns many miles away.

Water-bombing planes and helicopters flew over the blazes but it seemed an almost futile battle against the size of the roaring fires. The Adelaide area was hotter yesterday than 
Melbourne (41C), Canberra (37C) and Sydney and Brisbane (both 28C) as 
Australia proved the hottest place on earth.

Other
 top temperatures across the world were recorded in Mumbai (27C), India,
 Peruvian capital Lima (26C), Singapore (28C) and Los Angeles in the 
United States (28C).

Temperatures in Adelaide have barely dropped beneath 30C over the last few nights.

And in Melbourne, Australian Open tennis players and spectators alike were badly affected by the temperatures, which topped 40C.

With
 temperatures 2C higher than Wednesday, one player, Canadian Frank 
Dancevic, hallucinated the cartoon dog Snoopy before fainting during a 
match.

Yesterday a climate research group warned Australia it can expect even 
longer and hotter heat waves in the future than current one scorching large swathes of the country.

The
 privately run Climate Council, which includes former members of the 
country’s government-funded climate change watchdog shut by prime minister Tony Abbott's conservative government last year, warned in a 
report that Australia had only begun to feel the impact of climate 
change.

The heat wave, 
says the report's author, Will Steffen, follows the felling of a host of
 temperature records in 2013, including the hottest year on record.

'Australia has always had hot weather. 
However, climate change is loading the dice toward more extreme hot 
weather,’ Steffen said.

Hoping to avert climate change,
 Australia aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 5 per cent below 
2000 levels by 2020, a target that requires a cut of 431 million tonnes 
of CO2 between now and 2020.

The government released details of a 
$1.55billion (£0.8billion) Emissions Reduction Fund last month but some 
experts say design flaws and a lack of clarity mean it is unlikely to 
meet its climate targets.

Phil Cohn, co-founder of clean technology 
project developers Ramp Carbon, said the biggest problem with the ERF is
 that it sets no overall cap on emissions for Australia, meaning there 
would be no mechanism to ensure pollution doesn't spiral.

‘If we emit more in sectors that don't participate much in the ERF auctions, we are going to miss the target,’ he said.
