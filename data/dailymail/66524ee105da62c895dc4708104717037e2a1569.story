Raheem Sterling is confident that Liverpool have found the perfect player to 'fill the void' left by Luis Suarez's departure in new £16million signing Mario Balotelli.

Balotelli moved to Anfield from AC Milan last week and he is expected to form a strong attacking partnership with Daniel Sturridge.

And England winger Sterling is confident that manager Brendan Rodgers has signed the right man to replace Suarez, who left for Barcelona for £60m this summer.

Speaking to FourFourTwo, Sterling said of Balotelli: 'He's a massive player. The manager has brought him in and it's exciting times for Liverpool.

'This is a step forward after losing Luis at the start of the season. He (Balotelli) has come in to try and fill the void left by Luis and think he has the qualities to do so.

'I'm looking forward to working with him and I think he can be an important player for the club.'

When asked what Balotelli's major strengths were and what the striker could bring to Liverpool, Sterling replied: 'Goals. Obviously we lost a goalscorer in Luis so it's something we're going to need to replace.

'He'll also bring a presence on the pitch, especially up front, as part of our attack.'
