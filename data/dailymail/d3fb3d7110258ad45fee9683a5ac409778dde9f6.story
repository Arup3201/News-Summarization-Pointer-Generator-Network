For most people, swimming with whales is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity - but not if you've grown up like these children.

From as young age age four, these kids have grown up alongside the majestic mammals.

It all began when British underwater camera operator, Darren Rice, moved from the UK to Tonga to oversee the Matafonua resort with his wife, Nina.

For most people, swimming with humpback whales is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but not if you've grown up like the Rice children

Darren Rice and his wife Nine have raised their three children in Tonga and encouraged them to mingle with marine animals. Pictured: JJ (aged 9) and Lily (aged 6) swimming with humpback whales

It's there where his three children, JJ, aged nine, Abbie, aged eight and Lily, aged six, have had the opportunity to mingle with marine animals in water as shallow as 500m deep. 

While many parents would be reluctant to let their children swim with 40 tonne humpback whales, Darren insists that his kids are safe.

He said: 'The whales are very gentle and accommodating. I have noted over the years that they enjoy interacting with children, especially the mothers with young babies of their own. There is no danger.

'As a resort we specialise in taking people out everyday during the season to swim with the whales.'

And the whales are as gentle and accommodating as the children are! Here, the marine mammals get close to JJ during a swim in 2012

The resort that the Rice's operate specialises in taking visitors out to swim with whales, which Darren insists is perfectly safe

The proud dad wouldn't dream of putting his kids in danger and insists that the company takes about 500 people out per year to swim

'We are one of the few places in the world where this is permitted,' he added.

'I have been an underwater cameraman now for 20 years and wouldn't dream of placing my children in any danger.

'We take about 500 people a year to swim with the whales without incident.'

Each year the humpback whales return to waters surrounding Foa Island, where the resort is based, to mate and give birth.

And Darren's three children have been present in the ocean to witness such miraculous events.

The children have even formed a special bond with two of the whales, which they have nicknamed Narla and Geraldine.

When the children aren't playing with the majestic marine mammals, they are often spotted snorkelling in the clear waters. Pictured: Abbie (aged 8) swimming on Foa Island

Darren said: 'They have been here several times with newborn babies and they particularly enjoy the children's company.

'Last year Geraldine kept pushing her new baby boy over toward the children encouraging him to interact.

'We see lots of the same whales every year. Mothers with newborns tend to visit the same nursery areas to give birth and to nurse.'

The children have even been present for the birthing of whales, so it's no surprise they've formed a special bond with two of the mammals 

These children enjoy spending time engaging in a wide range of water activities, especially JJ who loves to go paddleboarding

Darren adds that while the children love to spend time with the whales, they always keep a safe distance because the babies can be 'clumsy'

But Darren and his young charges are always careful to give the mammals their much-needed space.

'We always maintain a safe distance from the whales not because they are a threat but the babies often only weeks old can be very clumsy and when a five tonne baby gets clumsy you don't want to be nearby.'
