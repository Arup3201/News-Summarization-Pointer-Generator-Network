Britain is facing gridlock this Easter weekend as engineering works on the railways will lead to long queues during the Bank Holiday getaway. 

As many as 16 million motorists are set to take to the roads over Easter, with four million travelling on Good Friday and 4.5 million on Easter Sunday.

Disruption to the train lines coupled with the gloomy weather forecast, has meant Britain's roads will be even busier than usual for the Easter break. 

Drivers could face travel misery this Easter as disruption to railways will see more people opt to use their cars

More people are planning to drive because of works on the rail network and a surge in people travelling abroad to seek sunshine

'The first spring bank holiday of the year traditionally heralds the start of busier weekends on the nation's roads,' said RAC head of external affairs Pete Williams.

He went on: 'This Easter is set to be a hectic one with 16 million of us getting behind the wheel for an Easter break, but at least we will benefit from the longer days and lighter evenings to complete our journeys.' 

Despite the surge in traffic, the Highways Agency (which becomes Highways England on April 1) is maintaining 55 sets of roadworks over the Bank Holiday weekend. 

Parts of the M1, M3, M4 and M6 likely to be hit by lane closures or speed restrictions.

However, the agency said that 62 other roadworks would be temporarily lifted to ease the congestion.  

The increase in the number of people planning to travel by car is thought to have been in part triggered by a significant shutdown of the rail network.

A string of engineering projects is expected to cause delays and overcrowding on some of Britain's busiest lines.

Work is planned on three key routes - the West Coast main line, First Great Western and Greater Anglia - forcing passengers to make diversions on slower trains or spend hours on the dreaded replacement coaches. 

Network Rail said engineering works were planned over the Easter holidays because passenger numbers fell by 20 per cent. 

A spokesman told MailOnline: 'More than 90 per cent of the rail network is unaffected by our improvement work but a few lines are significantly impacted and passengers should check our website before travelling.

'The work is designed to improve the railway delivering new facilities, new signalling, new bridges, new track and flyovers all to give passengers a better, more reliable railway.'

Last Christmas, thousands of passengers were crammed together outside Finsbury Park station, a small commuter stop in north London, in freezing conditions because Kings Cross had failed to reopen

In a move that has been described by an expert as 'adding insult to injury', Virgin Trains and London Midland have cancelled advanced cheap fares forcing passengers to purchase more expensive off-peak tickets. 

Both Virgin and London Midland say they cannot offer advance fares as the tickets would not be valid with other operators and replacement services. 

A trip from London to Manchester will cost £82 instead of the usual £15 advanced single ticket and take three hours, 53 minutes for a trip via Sheffield, compared to the usual two hours, eight minutes direct service. 

A journey from London to Liverpool will see passengers fork out £31.50 instead of £12 for a six-hour trip that involves four trains and a bus, instead of the normal direct service taking three hours, 16 minutes. 

Ian Baldry, of IBPTS consultants, told the Sunday Express: 'It's a rip-off. Paying more for journeys taking longer adds insult to injury. 

'Passengers should be entitled to reduced, not increased, fares when engineering works affect journeys.' 

A Virgin Trains spokesman said: 'All Easter weekend trains in and out of London Euston to all destinations have not had usual discounted advance fares made available. 

'Advance fares are only available on our services and due to the engineering works, there will not be any Virgin Trains services to travel on.'

London Midland said: 'We’re unable to offer usual advance fares from London through the Trent Valley, to Birmingham and Northampton from Good Friday; and from Saturday lunchtime also for journeys from Birmingham to Liverpool.

'Advance fares are for particular trains. Engineering work means there is no way to put advance purchase fares on buses or alternative operators’ services.' 

Terry Oliver, London Midland's Head of West Coast services, has even encouraged passengers to avoid travelling this Easter.

He said: 'London Midland will be running rail-replacement bus services over the Bank Holiday weekend, but journeys will involve changes and will take much longer than normal.'

A string of engineering projects is expected to cause delays and overcrowding on some of the busiest lines

Last Christmas, Mark Carne, the chief executive of Network Rail, was forced to forego his annual bonus worth up to £135,000 after chaos on the railways caused by over-running engineering projects.

Thousands of passengers were crammed together outside Finsbury Park station, a small commuter stop in north London, in freezing conditions because Kings Cross had failed to reopen.

Mr Carne said: 'Our improvement programme this Easter is focused on delivering a better service for passengers. 

'We are acutely conscious that many people want to use the railway during the holidays, which is why the vast majority of the network is running normally over the holiday period - but there will be disruption for some.

'I would like to apologise to any passengers whose plans are affected by our improvement work, but I hope they will understand that this is a quieter time on the railway and we want to minimise the overall impact of these vital projects on passengers.'   

The gloomy weather forecast this Bank Holiday weekend will increase the traffic on Britain's roads as travellers go abroad in search of sunshine. 

Figures from Gatwick airport show that more than two million passengers are expected to fly off for foreign holidays over the Easter break - a four per cent rise on the same period last year.

Almost 50,000 more people than last year have bought air tickets for travel over the Easter weekend compared with last year. Barcelona, Dublin and Malaga are the most popular destinations.
