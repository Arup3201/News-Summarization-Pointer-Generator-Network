Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney poked fun at Barack Obama's penchant for golf, Hillary Clinton's emails and even discussed One Direction on the Tonight Show. 

In the interview with Jimmy Fallon, Romney talked to his 'reflection' in the mirror and cracked jokes at the President's expense and at his own failed attempt to reach the White House.

Earlier this year Romney declared he would not be running for the presidency again, which gave him free rein in the interview.

In the interview with Jimmy Fallon on Tonight Show, Mitt Romney made jokes at President Obama's expense

In the 'Mitt in the Mirror' sketch, Romney pretended to talk to himself in the mirror with host Jimmy Fallon

Obama has played more than 200 rounds of golf as President - a point Romney joked about in the interview

Referring to his upcoming charity boxing bout against Evander Holyfield, Romney quipped: 'I guess it's not the first time we lose to a black guy'

Fallon, pretending to be Romney in the mirror, opened up by asking the real Romney whether he was ready for the big interview.  

'Well, actually I'm a little nervous,' Romney admitted. 'Jimmy is probably going to ask me why I didn't run for president. What should I say?'

'Just tell him you enjoy the freedom. You get to sit back, relax, golf all the time, go on vacation whenever you want,' Fallon said as Romney's reflection.

'Aka, be president?' Romney quipped. 

Obama - who was derided by basketball ace Michael Jordan as a 'hack' on the course - has played more than 200 rounds of golf since he entered the White House. 

Romney joked about Zayn leaving One Direction saying it was one of the 'important issues facing this nation'

Romney then went on to discuss his upcoming bout with former heavyweight boxing champion, Evander 'the Real Deal' Holyfield.

Romney's reflection wanted some assurance they were not crazy for taking to the ring with the four-time heavyweight champion. 

The real Romney replied: 'It's all in good fun. It's for charity, what's the worse that can happen?'

His reflection joked: 'That's true, I guess it's not the first time we lose to a black guy'. 

Romney will be squaring off against Holyfield - who famously had part of his ear bitten off by 'Iron' Mike Tyson in 1997 - for Charity Vision's 'Fight Night' in Salt Lake City on May 15. 

The pair clearly enjoyed the sketch, which mocked Hillary Clinton's emails and Obama's love of golf

Romney then delved into the world of showbiz to discuss Zayn Malik's departure from boy band One Direction. 

He said: 'There are important issues facing this great nation; turmoil in the Middle East, an immigration crisis here at home and now Zayn has quit One Direction. Thanks Obama.' 

Moving back to more familiar ground, the real Romney interrupted saying: 'I've got an email here. Hold on, let me take a look.'

Fallon, as Romney's reflection, asked: 'Is it work or personal?' 

To this, Romney quipped: 'Well, the email is from Hillary Clinton, so I guess it's both.' 

This joke comes in the wake of revelations that Mrs Clinton did not have a government email address from 2009 to 2013.  

The correspondence of federal officials is considered government records under federal law.

While there are exceptions for classified materials, most documents are kept for the use of journalists, congressional committees and historians. 

Following the controversy, Mrs Clinton said she had simply used private emails out of 'convenience' during her time as Secretary of State. 

In response to the attention, Clinton said she had in December 2014 handed over 55,000 pages of e-mails to the State Department following their request and now wanted them made public.

Romney joked about Mrs Clinton's emails - she did not have a government email address from 2009 to 2013

Referring to Zayn's split from One Direction, Romney remarked: 'There are important issues facing this great nation; turmoil in the Middle East, an immigration crisis here at home and now Zayn has quit One Direction'

Romney, a former Governor of Massachusetts, was defeated by Obama in the 2012 presidential election.

In January, he revealed he would not be running for the presidency again.

Mr Romney, 68, said he had decided it was 'best to give other leaders in the party the opportunity to become our next nominee'.

This week, Ted Cruz, the firebrand Texas senator, became the first Republican candidate to declare himself officially in the race before a crowd of thousands at Liberty University in Virginia.
