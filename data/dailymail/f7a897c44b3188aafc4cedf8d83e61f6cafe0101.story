They may be forged in a pina colada-fuelled, sun-drenched atmosphere but holiday friendships rarely last beyond the end of the trip, according to new research.

Some holidaymakers even give fake phone numbers to avoid being pestered by their newfound friends once back home, reveals the survey.

Of 2,000 people surveyed, 58 per cent said they regularly made friends when away but only 6 per cent managed to keep the friendships going for as long as a month after returning home.

Best friends forever? A new survey has revealed that while 58 per cent of holidaymakers regularly make friends when they're away, only 6 per cent keep in touch with them

Also, 59 per cent admitted to contacting their new friends just the once after the trip. Around 22 per cent gave out false phone numbers to deter further contact.

But 38 per cent said they went on holidays especially to form new friendships, with 1 per cent even eventually marrying their new friend.

Will they stay in touch? The survey also found that 59 per cent of holidaymakers admitted to contacting their new friends just the once after the trip

The poll showed Londoners are the most pally when on a trip, with 83 per cent making friends every time they go away. Next most-matey are the Welsh, followed by West Midlanders.

Those least likely to strike up friendships on holiday are people from South East England, found the survey by hotels.com.

Awkward: Around 22 per cent go as far as to give out false phone numbers to deter further contact with holiday friends
