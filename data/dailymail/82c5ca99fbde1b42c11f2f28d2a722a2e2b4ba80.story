The harrowing images of dead and emaciated concentration camp victims have long stood as testament to the appalling cruelty off the Nazi regime.

But now an Estonian newspaper has provoked worldwide outrage by publishing an advert for diet pills mocking the gaunt victims of Germany's largest death camp.

The astonishing picture of dozens of starving men is accompanied by the strapline: 'One, Two, Three… Dr Mengele slimming pills work wonders for you! There were no thickset people in Buchenwald!'

Outrage: The advert carries the strapline: 'One, Two, Three… Dr Mengele slimming pills work wonders for you! There were no thickset people in Buchenwald!'

Jewish organizations have denounced Eesti Ekspress for publishing the image which ran in the paper's humor section.

Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem called the mock advert in the Eesti Ekspress weekly a 'perverted attempt at humor at the expense of the Nazis' millions of victims'.

Alla Jakobson, spokeswoman for Estonia's Jewish community, said in newspaper Postimees that the incident shows Estonian society is experiencing 'major problems with moral and ethical values'.

More than 56,000 people are thought to have been killed in Buchenwald concentration camp, built by the Nazis near Weimar, Germany, in 1937.

Sulev Vedler, deputy editor of Eesti Ekspress, said the mock advert was poking fun at an Estonian gas company that recently used an image of Auschwitz to promote its services.

Harrowing: A photo, dated April 16, 1945, shows inmates of the German KZ Buchenwald inside their barrack, a few days after U.S troops of the 80th Division liberated this concentration camp near Weimar

Rescue: Inmates of the German concentration camp Buchenwald near Weimar, Germany, march to receive treatment at an American hospital after the camp is liberated by Gen. Patton's 3rd U.S. Army troops, in April 1945

But Vedler apologised for the offence caused, adding that it 'was not targeted against Jewish people'.

GasTerm Eesti recently caused a major backlash after it featured the infamous gates to Nazi death camp 
Auschwitz in an advert for its services.

Next to the inscription 'Arbeit macht frei,' or 'Work
makes you free', the caption of the photo read: 'Gas heating — 
flexible, convenient, and effective.'

Within a day the gas company had removed to image from the website and company director Sven Linros issued an apology.

According to the DzD.ee news site, he said, : 'Hitler killed himself because he 
got a gas bill… a lot of people laugh at this, but I do not.

'I visited 
Auschwitz with dread. I feel sorry for the victims and their families. 
The picture was intended for a narrow group of people.

'We wanted to 
clarify that the CH4 gas is not toxic and can be used to heat buildings,
even those with such a sad history.'
