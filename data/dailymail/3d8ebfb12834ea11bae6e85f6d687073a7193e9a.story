Real Madrid have reached a deal to sign midfielder Lucas Silva from Brazilian club Cruzeiro on a long-term contract.

Madrid said on Friday that Silva has signed a contract tying him to the European champions until June 30, 2020. 

Silva had been linked with a move to Arsenal, but instead opted to join the Spanish club rather than the Premier League. 

Lucas Silva has completed his move to Real Madrid, the club announced on Friday

The Cruzeiro defensive midfielder has joined Los Blancos for a fee reported to be £11.5m

Madrid said in a statement that the 21-year-old midfielder will be presented at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium on Monday 'after undergoing the relevant medical examination.'

Madrid did not disclose the transfer fee, but reports say the Champions League holders paid 15million euros (£11.5m) for the player.

The 21-year-old has been linked with a host of Premier League sides - including Arsenal - during the last few months.

He is considered to be one of Brazil's most promising young players and has represented his country at junior level. 

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has missed out on a player that he coveted highly
