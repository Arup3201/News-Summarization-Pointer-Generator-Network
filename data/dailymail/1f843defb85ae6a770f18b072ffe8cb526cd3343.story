After a difficult day where William attended the funeral of his beloved nanny and Kate was forced to do a solo engagement, the Royal couple were reunited last night.

They went to a party at the exclusive London private members club Loulou's in Mayfair with other guests including the Duchess of Cambridge's sister Pippa and the Duke's cousin Princess Eugenie.

They are very rarely seen out together other than at an official event but the pair decided to let their hair down - leaving the club at around midnight.

ends of the country Kate and William partied with friends at the 
exclusive Loulou's in Mayfair until midnight last night

They arrived unexpectedly - 'Nobody knew they were coming and then at 10pm they were swept in through a back door. They stayed for about couple of hours,' an insider told MailOnline.

Kate's sister Pippa was also at the event, and was seen leaving with a friend in a taxi at around 2.30am after a night catching up with her sibling.

Princess Eugenie was also seen smiling as she left Loulou's with her boyfriend Jack Brooksbank, and others also at the party included Jemima Khan and her brother - MP Zach Goldsmith.

Night out: The Royal couple were taken out of the club's back door and rushed to their car home

Long day: The Duchess was followed out of the door by her husband after what would have been a tough 24 hours for them

Relaxed: Kate was wearing a black coat and dress while William wore more casual trousers and a smart jacket

Loulou's is owned by Robin Birley, who is the son of Mark Birley who created the famous Annabel's club, named after the mother of Zach and Jemima - Lady Annabel Vane-Tempest-Stewart.

The exclusive Annabel's was frequented by the Prince of Wales, Camilla Parker-Bowles, Princess Anne, US President Richard Nixon and Frank Sinatra among many more.

It came as Kate returned from a successful trip 
to Newcastle where she wowed large crowds and even hugged a lucky young 
boy who was waiting to see her.

Cheeky ten-year-old Terry Campbell managed to get a full hug from the Duchess of Cambridge simply by holding his arms out wide for her.

Terry was among a group of children from a local school who were waiting excitedly outside Newcastle’s Civic Centre for a glimpse of Kate.

When she saw him gesturing she opened
her arms and asked: ‘Am I going to get a cuddle as well?’ Without a 
second thought she then leant over the steel barrier and embraced him.

Terry, wearing his school uniform 
under a green hoodie, went a brighter shade of red moments later and 
appeared almost lost for words when asked what it had been like to 
cuddle a real-life royal.

Prince William was attending the private funeral of his former
nanny while Kate visited the Newcastle Civic Centre.

Olga Powell died in September aged 
82, cared for Wiliam and his brother Harry for most of their childhood, including the difficult period when their parents’ marriage was breaking up in the early 1990s.

The former royal nanny, who was in her 80s and lived in Broxbourne, 
Hertfordshire, died last month after a heart attack. She had worked for 
the Prince and Princess of Wales from the 1980s until the early 1990s.

A royal spokesman said: 'Given
the significant role that Mrs. Powell played in the Princes' lives, The
Duke (Prince William) wished to pay his respects in person.'

Ben Goldsmith and his girlfriend were also at the event with Kate and William

As the Duchess of Cambridge arrived 
in Stockton yesterday afternoon she was greeted by hundreds of excited locals
who has been waiting for hours to catch a glimpse of the beautiful 
Royal.

Kate arrived to cheers from the 
crowds lining Prince Regent Street as she paid a special visit to the 
CRI Stockton Recovery Service.

And
the hundreds of people who waited patiently behind the barriers to 
catch a glimpse of the princess were not left disappointed as Kate 
worked her way down the line with a beaming smile on her face.

'She’s absolutely beautiful - she 
really is fantastic,' gushed Diane Holder, 64, from Ingleby Barwick, 
'She has beautiful hair - she is just a beautiful woman!'

Kate was in Stockton to pay a special
visit to The Stockton Recovery Service which supports people aged 18 
and over who are adicted to drugs.

As a patron of Action
on Addiction she was particularly moved to meet families involved in 
Action on Addiction’s Moving Parents and Children Together (M-PACT) 
programme.

The
CRI-run service in Stockton is one of the charity's licensed partners 
and the focus of this visit was to learn about their work with children 
living with parental substance misuse and addiction.

Hundreds of well wishers lined the streets waving Union Jack flags to welcome the Duchess

The Duchess of Cambridge greeted enthralled crowds outside Newcastle’s Civic Centre

Stockton was the third stop on the Duchess's packed itinerary on her first official visit to the North East.

Earlier in the day as she greeted 
crowds outside Newcastle’s Civic Centre she made her way along to a 
group of school children who had been waiting excitedly all morning for a
glimpse of the Royal.

Among them was 10-year-old Terry who had vowed to get a hug from the Duchess – even maybe a kiss.

And he was far from disappointed when his moment arrived.

As the Duchess made her way along to the cheeky youngster he immediately held his arms out wide. 

The Duchess then asked him: ‘Am I going to get a cuddle as well?’

Without a seconds thought she leant forward over the steel barrier and embraced the schoolboy.

‘It was good,’ he said, still 
slightly stunned by his first encounter with royalty. ‘I was hoping to 
get a hug from her when we came here this morning.

‘I never actually thought it would happen.  I can’t believe she hugged me back.

‘She was everything I thought she would be. She was really nice.’

A school friend interrupted: ‘The one thing he really wanted though was a kiss.’
