Cameroon's army has freed 24 of the 80 hostages kidnapped during a cross-border attack by bloodthirsty terrorists Boko Haram. 

The kidnapping took place in the north of Cameroon on
Sunday near the village of Mabass, with scores of children among those abducted.

Boko Haram has killed thousands of people and kidnapped hundreds in its bid to carve out an Islamic state in northern Nigeria, with this attack among the worst committed on Cameroonian soil.

Threat: Earlier this month the militant threatened Cameroon in a YouTube post, warning that the same fate would befall the country as neighbouring Nigeria

'The Cameroon army was able to free about 24 hostages taken
yesterday by Boko Haram in the far north. They were freed as
defence forces pursued the attackers who were heading back to
Nigeria,' ministry spokesman Colonel Didier Badjeck said.

The attack came as neighbouring nation Chad deployed troops to help
Cameroon in its efforts to tackle the Islamist insurgency in the area.

Yesterday government spokesman Issa Tchiroma condemned the attack, which killed three people.

'There was a Boko Haram attack on several localities in the Far North region,' he said.

'The assailants burnt down about 80 homes and kidnapped several inhabitants including women and very young children.'

In an attack that gained worldwide attention last year, Boko Haram fighters kidnapped more than 200 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok, in north-east Nigeria.

Destruction: Last week, it was estimated that 2,500 people were killed and more than 3,000 buildings were razed to the ground when Boko Haram attacked the towns of Baga and Doron Baga, northern Nigeria

The fanatics have stepped up attacks in the region as Nigeria prepares for a presidential election in less than a month.

In a video posted online earlier this month, a man claiming to be Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau threatened increase violence in neighbouring Cameroon unless it scraps its constitution and embraces Islam.

Faced with increased violence along the border, Yaounde has deployed thousands of additional troops, including elite soldiers, to the area. 

Boko Haram outraged the world last week when they indiscriminately murdered innocent men, women and children as they attacked the towns of Baga and Doron Baga.

The terrorist group slaughtered an estimated 2,500 people including a woman while she was in labour.

Daniel Eyre, Nigeria researcher for Amnesty International, said this was the 'largest and most destructive' Boko Haram assault his organisation has ever analysed.

He added: 'These detailed images show devastation of catastrophic proportions in two towns, one of which was almost wiped off the map in the space of four days.'

February 2014: The jihadist group raided the Nigerian village of Izghe in the north of the country and murdered dozens - before going door-to-door and killing anyone they came across.

April 2014: More than 200 schoolgirls are abducted from the town of Chibok, which Boko Haram burned to the ground.

August 2014: The terror group kidnapped at least 97 people during raids on villages in Borno State. They killed 28 boys and men.

November 2014: 120 people killed in a bomb attack on a central Mosque in Kano - the principal city of northern Nigeria.

January 4, 2015:  Boko Haram kidnaps 40 boys and young men, believed to be aged ten to 23, from a village in the  Nigerian state of Borno.

January 3-7, 2015: Boko Haram attacked the towns of Baga and Doron Baga in northern Nigeria, slaughtering an estimated 2,500, displacing around 35,000 and taking 500 women captive.
