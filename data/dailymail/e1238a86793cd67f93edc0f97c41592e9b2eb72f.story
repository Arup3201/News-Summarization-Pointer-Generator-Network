Teachers on a school trip to Spain repeatedly got drunk and fought in front of the children, it has been claimed.

Scared pupils from Stanley Park High sent frantic text messages to their parents complaining that staff were out of control.

Four teachers are alleged to have had regular drunken nights out in Lloret de Mar – one suffering a black eye in a foul-mouthed scrap with a colleague.

Teachers from Stanley Park High School (above) in Carshalton allegedly became involved in a drunken brawl wihle they were supposed to be looking after children on a trip to Spain

Another staff member has been accused 
of abandoning a sick child, leaving her without medication, to go out 
drinking in the resort.

Seventy-five
 boys and girls aged between 12 and 16 had paid £700 each to take part 
in seven-day sports tour, playing a series of football and netball 
matches on the Costa Brava during half term last month.

The
 pupils – from Carshalton in south London – visited the PortAventura 
theme park and Barcelona FC’s home ground.

News of the teachers’ 
late-night antics in the resort, known for excessive drinking and bad 
behaviour, reached school authorities only after the party arrived home.

Now parents have demanded that the school dismiss the teachers alleged to have been involved in the bad behaviour.

Claims: At least one teacher reportedly got injured in the fracas on the sports tour to Barcelona (pictured)

One,
 who asked not to be named, said last night: ‘My child sent me a text 
message saying how scared she was to go to sleep because there were 
drunk teachers fighting. 

‘She
 said they were all teachers and were calling each other very rude 
words. They hit each other and the students were very scared. One 
teacher came away with a black eye.

‘There
 was another girl who wasn’t very well on the trip and they couldn’t 
find the teacher who had their medication because they had gone 
drinking!

‘They should not 
be going out and getting drunk when they have 75 children in their care.
 As for the fighting, you think they would know better.’

Staff
 at the Samba Hotel in Lloret de Mar confirmed the teachers had been 
badly behaved. One worker told the Daily Mail: ‘The night staff know all
 about the goings-on.’

Another
 parent said: ‘This has come at a bad time for staff relations at the 
school. Teachers took part in the NUT strike recently and that caused a 
bit of friction with the head.’ The trip is believed to have been led by
 seven members of staff from the school’s performance department, which 
specialises in drama, dance, media, music and physical education.

Allegations of bad and inappropriate behaviour have been levelled at four of the seven.

The head of the department, Paul Stapleton, has declined to comment.

Mel
 Kermally, business manager at Stanley Park High, said: ‘The school has 
taken all matters very seriously and we have been conducting a thorough 
and detailed investigation upon the return trip into the allegations 
made.’

The school last night refused to confirm whether any members of staff had been suspended or sacked.

A state-funded mixed-sex comprehensive, Stanley Park has 1,093 pupils aged 11 to 19.

A
 damning Ofsted inspection last year found the school ‘requires 
improvement’, mainly because pupils had achieved lower than average GCSE
 grades year after year.

Inspectors highlighted concerns about teachers’ abilities, criticising marking and lesson planning.

The report concluded: ‘The progress made by students in English and mathematics in 2011 and 2012 was not good enough.’
