A Mother who posed as her 11-year-old daughter to trap an internet predator told last night of her shock after hearing he had walked free from court.

Matthew Jenart, 28, dodged jail after he admitted targeting the girl on Facebook and sending her messages asking for ‘naked fun’.

Yesterday the unemployed loner said he had ‘expected’ to go to jail for his actions, which can carry a maximum sentence of 14 years.

In a series of shocking messages, he 
posed as a local 15-year-old boy and asked for ‘naughty fun’, adding, 
‘try it you will like it’.

But despite knowing his intended 
target was only 11, Jenart was allowed to walk free after Teesside Crown
Court Recorder Robert Adams said he could not be sure of his 
intentions.

Jenart is now back at his home, which is within driving distance of his 
victim – and yesterday his Facebook page was still active.

The Mail has campaigned for ministers to create more stringent legislation to protect youngsters online.

The shocked mother's youngster told her about the messages (posed by model)

Last night, the girl’s mother hit out at the judge’s decision to spare 
Jenart from jail and said the exchange had left her feeling ‘physically 
sick’.

She said: ‘It’s very disappointing that he didn’t go to prison. I was 
hoping he would be behind bars where he can’t be a danger to any other 
young girls.

‘I’m surprised the judge said he wasn’t sure of his intentions. I was 
the one on the receiving end of his messages and they seemed pretty 
clear to me.

‘I had everything there in black and white, all the evidence the police 
needed and I hoped that would result in him going to prison.

‘What more do they need? Do they need a child to be molested or murdered before they take action?’

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, managed to trap Jenart
when he contacted her daughter on  Facebook in December.

The court heard how she had only allowed her daughter to use the social 
networking site on the condition she give her mother access to all her 
messages and ‘friend’ requests.

Posing as her daughter, the woman made it clear that she was just 11 – but Jenart still bombarded her with perverted messages.

The girl’s mother was so sickened by the conversation that she called 
police, who were then able to track Jenart down from his online profile.

After his arrest, the former hotel worker of Thornaby, Teesside, claimed
he would not have taken matters further and it had just been a joke.

Teesside Crown Court heard how the unemployed hotel worker claimed he was 15-years-old when he was online

When officers accessed his account, it was revealed he had also contacted other young girls online.

Mr Recorder Adams, a former serviceman who became a lawyer in 1993, called the behaviour ‘bizarre’ and ‘disgusting’.

However, he said: ‘In this case, it is not clear precisely what you were attempting to incite her to do.’

He sentenced Jenart to a three-year community order after he admitted attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity.

Jenart was also put on the sex offenders’ register for five years, 
ordered to undergo a treatment programme and will be banned from working
with children. Speaking to the Mail after the case, Jenart said: ‘I am 
sorry for what I did. I know I did wrong. I was expecting to go to jail,
I’m glad that didn’t happen.’

The case has alarming parallels with that
of Ashleigh Hall from nearby Darlington, Co Durham, who was 17 when she
was abducted and killed by online predator Peter Chapman.

The girl’s mother said it was that case that made her take the perverted
messages so seriously – as she knew he had contacted other girls in the
area.

Facebook only allows children over the age of 13 to have an account, but
many youngsters get around the rules by lying about their date of 
birth.

Last night the mother of the 11-year-old added: ‘Cases like these show 
why parents have to be so careful. In our family we insist on complete 
trust and honesty, which means there are no secrets.

‘I’m so glad that I was cautious, it’s terrifying to think what might have happened if I had not.

‘When my daughter asked to join Facebook I had some reservations about 
it, but like many parents in that situation I didn’t want her to feel 
excluded from her friends who were on it. More should be done by the 
Government to protect youngsters online, as it’s really hard for parents
to monitor them.

‘The Daily Mail’s campaign is a great idea, I give it 110 per cent of my support.’
