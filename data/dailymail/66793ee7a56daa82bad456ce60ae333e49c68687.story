Arsenal are willing to open the bidding for Everton midfielder James McCarthy at £16million.

The Republic of Ireland international has been pinpointed by Arsene Wenger and his coaching staff as a player who is ready made for their team and who will provide the defensive discipline they are lacking.

McCarthy only joined Everton from Wigan last year in a £13m deal and has continually caught the eye with the way he has marshalled their midfield alongside Gareth Barry and maintained a high level of consistency.

Everton are reluctant to sell any of their stars with pressure already coming from Chelsea for Seamus Coleman and several clubs monitoring Ross Barkley.

McCarthy is very much part of their plans and Arsenal’s offer is likely to be rejected but they are willing to go higher to test Everton’s resolve.

The 24-year-old McCarthy injured his hamstring against Wolfsburg on Thursday night and is out for at least around three weeks with a Grade One tear but that won’t deter Arsenal’s attempt.
