Politics is known as showbusiness for ugly people.

But MPs are hoping to look better on television after agreeing to a plan for cameras to capture them at more flattering angles.

New television cameras will be installed in the House of Commons chamber at eye-level in a bid to give more favourable views.

New cameras will capture MPs in the Commons chamber from more flattering angles after the election

At present, there are only eight high and fixed camera positions that MPs complain show off their bald spots and emphasise cleavage.

Female politicians have found that outfits that look acceptable from a normal angle look more revealing from above.

From after the general election, two extra cameras will capture MPs from eye-level. The new cameras will be installed behind the Speakers’ chair.

Sir Alan Haselhurst MP, chair of the Commons Administration Committee, said: ‘The Committee reviewed the trial footage and agreed that the new shots show Chamber proceedings in a way that will be more engaging, modern, and accessible to viewers.

‘The lower vantage points offer particular improvements when showing Members below the gangway, wheelchair users, and the front benches.’

Peter Knowles, controller of BBC Parliament, had previously told the committee that the current angles ‘are incredibly unflattering to the front benches’.

Cameras were first allowed into the Commons in 1989, despite fears from MPs that they could dumb down their debates.
