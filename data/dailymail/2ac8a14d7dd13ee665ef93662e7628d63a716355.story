Carol Vorderman is encouraging women to measure themselves as almost 1 in 2 women admit to wearing the wrong dress size.

New research released today shows 46 per cent of women polled wear clothes which are either too big or too small.

What's more, three quarters (73 per cent) of these women wear a garment that is a whole dress size out.

The study wascommissioned by isme.com and Manchester Metropolitan University

Carol, 52, who now has her own fashion collection at isme.com, has launched a natural body census with the brand.

Wearing an elegant knee-length grey and black dress, the stylish former Countdown star is pictured holding a tape around her waist to encourage women to get measuring.

Fashion fan Carol wants women across the country to measure their vital 
statistics in a bid to capture the current shape of the nation.

The campaign has been launched in response to the study commissioned by isme.com and Manchester Metropolitan University revealing how women viewed their body size.

Commenting
on the launch Carol said: 'I am delighted to be 
launching the first ever isme.com Body Census campaign.

Fashion fan Carol wants women across the country to measure their vital statistics

'To dress your body right, you have to know your shape and size, and what better way to do so than with a tape measure.

'I want ladies everywhere to get measuring, and, like me, discover their vital statistics.'

Julie Donnelly, head of womenswear for isme.com, added: 'We understand how important the perfect fit is in determining how good you look and feel.

'We're launching our new body census to ensure we continue to be an authority on body shapes.

'Throughout the years we've continually researched the changing female body shape to ensure we're delivering the best shape and fit.

'By asking the women of the UK to share their measurements with us and using the most up-to-date body scanning technology, we'll be able to paint an accurate picture of the female body today.'

Carol was announced as the new face of isme.com in February this year, and quickly increased popularity of the site with customers.

Speaking about her decision to sign up as the new face of the site, Carol said: 'For me being in your 50s is about trying something new. You can't say I'll do it in a few years' time, it doesn't work that way at this age, you do it now! Age is but a number and you should dress to suit your body shape and sense of style, not your age. And maybe you should try shocking your children every now and then. Life is too short not to after all.'

Jon Owen, retail director of isme said earlier this year: 'We knew she would be popular with our customers.'

The former Countdown star has always embraced her shapely physique and loves to wear fitted clothes.
