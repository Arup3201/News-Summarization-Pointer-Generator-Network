Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina has heaped praise on  Radamel Falcao, claiming his international team-mate can be an 'amazing player' for Manchester United.

The shot-stopper will be in Arsenal's FA Cup squad to face United on Monday night, and despite it being unclear whether he or Wojciech Szczesny will start in goal, Ospina will be making sure his team-mates are well aware of Falcao's threat.

'We haven't spoken about the match but we are in contact and I am absolutely convinced and can say with all confidence that Falcao is a player with a winning attitude, he has a strong mentality and is a great professional,' Ospina told the Evening Standard.

'He has demonstrated that in every team he has ever played in. When he has stability and continuity, he will come to the forefront and he is going to be an amazing player for Manchester United,' Ospina continued. 

'We will never underestimate him. He is an excellent forward and I will hope to stop him scoring any goals against us if I play.'

Ospina has been instrumental in Arsenal's recent run of form, nailing down the No 1 spot for Arsene Wenger's side.

Despite this, Szczesny was in goal for the Gunners' previous two FA Cup ties and has recovered from an illness which ruled him out of the previous match.

Whoever is given the nod is likely to face an out-of-sorts Falcao, who is running out of time to prove himself in the red of Manchester United.

The Colombian striker, who plays with Ospina for his country, joined United on deadline day last September in a loan move worth £6million, but is yet to secure a permanent contract.

It is believed that the club are as yet undecided on whether to trigger a permanent £43m deal, after Falcao's indifferent form has produced just four goals in 20 matches.
