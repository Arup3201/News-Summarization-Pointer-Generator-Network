Gabriel Barbosa Almeida, simply known by Gabriel, is the striker dubbed the 'new Neymar' who looks destined to follow in the Brazilian's footsteps from Santos to Barcelona.

The La Liga giants have preferential rights to buy the 18-year-old as part of their deal for former Santos striker Neymar from the Brazilian Serie A club last summer.

The forward, having made his professional debut as a 16-year-old, has also adapted the nickname 'Gabigol' due to his goalscoring prowess in Brazil.

Gabriel's current deal with Santos expires in 2015, and his agent Wagner Ribeiro is currently discussing an extension. In 14 games this year, Gabriel remains Santos's top goalscorer with five and three assists.

The move to Spain is a desired one, though, and Gabriel previously announced: 'Someday I hope to become a Barca player. I've dreamed of this since I was little, from the moment I started playing football.'

The bad news for Europe's elite clubs, however, is that Barcelona have the first option to make a move, and the Spanish side are understood to be keen to pounce sooner rather than later.
