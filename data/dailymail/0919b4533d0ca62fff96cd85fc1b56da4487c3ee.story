The New Hampshire parents whose son was shot dead by his best friend have vowed to offer the killer a home and a job once he's released from prison.

Donald St. Laurent II, 29, was shot in the head in 2011 by Christopher Bazar, who admitted to being drunk and high when he fired the shotgun.

Bazar, now 30, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to four to 10 years in prison.

His sentence was reduced, mostly because the victim's parents begged a judge for leniency. He was granted parole on Thursday and is expected to be released in a few weeks.

Now Bazar will move in with the victim's mother, Deborah St. Laurent, in her home in Nashua.

The victim's father, Donald St. Laurent, will give him a roofing job at his construction company.

'It's the end of a long road and the beginning of a new one,' Bazar said, according to WMUR. 

'It's a good day. It's a great day.' 

Deborah and Donald St. Laurent have long believed the shooting was an accident. 

Since Bazar's trial, the victim's parents have strongly defended Bazar and begged Judge Jacalyn Colburn for leniency because they never believed the shooting to have been intentional.

The two men had been 'close as brothers' and shared the apartment where the tragedy happened.

'He's my other son,' Deborah St. Laurent said in court, according to WMUR. 'My son loved him, and I love my son more than life.'

She added: 'My son loved him, and I know it was an accident.

'And I know that this is what my son would want me to do.'

In the minutes after the shooting, Bazar sobbed uncontrollably as he spoke to a 911 operator about what happened. He later said he had been drinking and smoking marijuana that night.

Bazar says he's worked through his drinking issues and is ready to be released.

'If I felt like I needed to drink, I’d just think of that night — and it thoroughly disgusts me,' he told the parole board, according to The Nashua Telegraph.

'Prison saved my life,' Bazar added. 'I’m very lucky, in an unlucky way.'

The victim's brother, Daniel St. Laurent, says Bazar has struggled  to cope with what he's done. 

'Killing your best friend is more of a punishment than the state of New Hampshire or anybody could ever give anybody,' says the the Army sergeant, who was serving in Afghanistan when the shooting happened. 

'And I don't want to lose another brother.'
