William Pooley, 29, was airlifted back to London after contracting the deadly virus while trying to save lives in Sierra Leone

Medics told yesterday of the stressful and desperate conditions in the makeshift ebola wards where the British victim worked.

Staff were too scared to come to work at Kenema government hospital where the floors were left splashed with blood.

The 350-bed hospital is a cluster of small cinder-block buildings in the centre of Kenema, the third largest city in Sierra Leone and a hot-spot for ebola.

The isolation units where the afflicted are taken are in temporary covered shelters with concrete floors, plastic sheeting for walls and tin roofs.

The doctors and nurses wear masks, goggles and impermeable Tyvek safety suits.

Nevertheless, 20 nurses and healthcare workers have died of ebola since the outbreak began. Loss of concentration brought on by the gruelling workload is blamed for them exposing themselves to the deadly virus.

Daniel Bausch, an American doctor and ebola expert who was at the hospital last month, said in one ward of 30 patients 'the floor was splashed with blood, vomit, faeces and urine'.

Ebola sufferers often fall out of bed, he said, creating a decontamination nightmare for medics, who would also have to haul the patients back into bed.

There were also staff shortages because nurses walked out after not receiving their £20 a week hazard pay.

One nurse who continued working, Sister Nancy Yoko, 36, said: 'No one wants to come close to us, the nurses in the general ward won't talk to us, even our families are scared they will catch the virus from us.' 

Ebola is new to Sierra Leone and there is much suspicion and mistrust about the hospital. There was even a rumour that locals wanted to burn down the Kenema site, which is in Sierra Leone's Eastern Province.

'They are angry with us, they don't believe we are trying to help,' said another nurse.

Robert Garry, an American professor of microbiology and immunology who has visited the hospital many times, said conditions were getting better.

Of the nurses' decision to strike, he said: 'It's not really surprising that some people made the judgement it's not worth their personal risk – no one could fault anyone for doing that.

'Some have set aside their own personal wellbeing and paid the ultimate price. We only wish the best for this young British nurse who put it all on the line.'

Professor Garry said the hospital was a decent multi-purpose facility by African standards but 'with not enough doctors, not enough nurses and not a whole lot of modern equipment'.

He added: 'Working in the ebola wards is very stressful. You are dealing with patients that are carrying a very dangerous virus – one mistake and you'll become infected yourself.

'If you are working long days, up to 18 hours, day after day, as no doubt this young British nurse did, you are more likely to make a mistake. Humans can only maintain that kind of intense concentration for so long.'

Colleagues who have returned from Kenema recently told him conditions were improving with more cleaners to do decontamination work. The hospital deals with 90 ebola cases a week.

A risk assessment published last month by Public Health England said the current outbreak could raise the danger for Britons working in humanitarian and healthcare delivery in affected areas.

However, the threat to tourists, visitors and expatriates was still considered 'very low if elementary precautions are followed'.
