Amanda Bynes has been placed under 51/50 psychiatric hold, TMZ reports.

However, worryingly, just hours before the news broke, the troubled star revealed that she has been in touch with Sam Lutfi, the controversial ex-manager of Britney Spears, who was blamed for the singer's 2008 meltdown.

'you feel like a brother to me @SamLutfi i mean it. Thank you luuuuv,' Amanda wrote to Sam, who did not respond to her directly.

Sam followed up Bynes' tweet, responding to Perez Hilton, saying: 'She's in good hands now. Many thanks to all those that helped along the way.'

And now Perez claims Bynes has told them: 'Last time I trusted Lutfi he put me in a conservatorship which ended in August I'm not stupid. 

'You are all listening to my brain…I can handle Sam, he just flew me back to LA and I'm going to meet some sick lawyers.' 

Lutfi has strenuously denied any claims that he was responsible for Britney's meltdown.

On his Twitter bio, he says he was 'FALSELY accused of doing horrible things by horrible people.' 

Britney's mother Lynne Spears blamed Lutfi for his involvement in her daughter's breakdown, when he managed her in 2007 and 2008.

Meanwhile, sources tell the TMZ that Amanda had a car service take her to The London Hotel, where her parents Lynne and Rick Bynes, as well as an attorney, persuaded her to go to hospital.

She is said to have then been taken to a hospital in Pasadena where her lawyer Tamar Armiak was waiting with doctors.  

The 51/50 hold authorizes a qualified officer or clinician to involuntarily confine a person suspected to have a mental disorder that makes him or her a danger to himself or herself.

She will be held at the hospital for 72 hours, but the hold can be extended for a further 14 days.

It is expected that her parents will try to get another conservatorship. 

The news comes after a source had told MailOnline that at 6am Friday morning that Amanda, 28, tried unsuccessfully to buy a ticket out of Manhattan.

According to the airport insider the actress then left the airport in a taxi cab hoping to be able to catch a flight out of JFK.

When contacted by the MailOnline the Port Authority confirmed Amanda had been at the airport but a spokesman said 'there were no summons and no arrests' made over the incident. 

The star was pictured by a fan inside the terminal buying food and was carrying multiple bags.

TMZ reports however, that the Easy A actress tried 'to force a ticket agent into re-routing a plane'.

The website said: 'Law enforcement sources say the shouting match was all because Amanda wanted a direct flight as soon as possible... and wouldn't listen to the agent explain that planes have a specific route.

'We're told things got so bad airport authorities had to step in to escort Bynes out of the building -- putting her into a cab outside to send Amanda on her way.'

Amanda has not been seen since, and it is not known if she was able to get a flight out of JFK airport.

With her whereabouts unknown, her parents Rick and Lynn are reportedly on their way into New York to try to get the actress into a mental health facility.

Ttroubled Amanda Bynes landed safely back in LAX on Friday, clearly having found a way out of her predicament of not being able to get a flight 

Wherever the star is, it is clear she has access to the internet or is not in the air as she spent most of Friday on Twitter.

Around lunchtime in New York, Amanda posted a serious of disturbing tweets accusing her father of sexually abusing her.

Explaining why she did not want to live with her father and mother in California - where she has been since been released from an inpatient psychiatric facility in December - the actress said on Twitter she could not be in the same house as her father.

The embattled star wrote: 'My dad was verbally and physically abuse to me as a child.

'He called me ugly as a child and then asked me if I wanted to have sex with him and I did not know how to respond and I said no and then... I was forced to live with my dad which was a total nightmare.'

Whereabouts unknown:The 28-year-old wore the same clothing as she did when she flew into the city last week, pictured, and was last seen headed to JFK airport

A few minutes later her tweets took an even more disturbing turn.

She wrote to her more than 3 million followers: 'My dad fondled himself in front of me so many times that I started recording him on my phone in hopes of catching him... saying or doing something inappropriate around me so I could get him arrested & put in jail for the rest of his perverted life.' 

Two hours later, Amanda recanted her statements and, in doing so, revealed the extent of her mental illness.

Taking the abusive comments back she said: 'My dad never did any of those things. The microchip in my brain made me say those things but he's the one that ordered them to microchip me.'

But the damage was already done with her mother Lynn issuing a statement saying she was 'heartbroken' over what her daughter had said.

While she took the comments back they had already done a lot of damage with the embattled star's mother Lynn telling Hollyscoop the family was heartbroken.

She said in a statement: 'I am heartbroken today for my husband of 47 years. Rick has been the best father and husband a family can ask for.

'He has never abused Amanda or our other children [Tommy and Julian] physically or sexually. These accusations are absolutely horrible and could not be further from the truth!'

Lynn said her daughter's mental illness is to blame for the claims.

'These allegations stem from Amanda's mental state at the moment. They have no basis in reality. It saddens me beyond belief that my husband's character could be slandered in such a way.' 

Disturbing turn: The 28-year-old went on to describe what she says her father did to her

Arminak also spoke to TMZ on the siblings' behalf, who defender their father.

Jillian O'Keefe and Tommy Bynes stated: 'We are disturbed beyond words that Amanda would come up with such a fabrication as a way to avoid getting much needed help or treatment.

'We are pained by [Amanda's] behavior but we absolutely give our full unconditional love and support to our wonderful parents.'

The 28-year was allegedly detained by store security but later released, according to TMZ.

Not well: The former child star, pictured October 6, has been seen out and about in New York acting bizarrely 

Amanda has been struggling with mental illness since last year and is believed to have taken a turn for the worse after she moved out of her parents' home in Thousand Oaks, California, as soon as their conservatorship of her ended August.

The troubled She's The Man actress was pulled over in the San Fernando Valley, just outside Los Angeles, on September 30 at 4 am and taken into custody, the California Highway Patrol confirmed with MailOnline.

She was cited for being under the influence of a controlled substance while driving her Mercedes-Benz. The 28-year-old star was released at 12 noon that same day on $15,000 bail.

The former child star is set to appear in court on October 23 in Van Nuys.
