Farmer Val Gunn was left horrified when she discovered Nelson the lamb after his ears had been hacked off by thugs

A farmer was left 'shocked and horrified' after a newborn lamb had its ears hacked off by cruel yobs.

Val Gunn, 71, discovered the injured baby sheep in a field when she went to check on her flock yesterday.

RSPCA investigators believe that thugs used a knife or scissors to deliberately chop off the animal's ears.

The little lamb, named Nelson, has been left deaf by the attack at Highthorn Farm near Gotham, Nottinghamshire, and has also been abandoned by its mother.

He is now being hand-rearerd by Val and her husband Kenneth, 73, but has been left in shock and is refusing to drink any milk.

Mrs Gunn said: 'We were looking around the farm and checking the sheep for any problems and we came across this poor lamb with no ears.

'We were completely shocked and horrified by it.

'There was no ragged bits or other tears on his body so it had obviously been done with a knife or scissors.

'He's not drinking any milk at all, he's just a little weak, sad thing.

'Nelson's body must have been in such shock, we're plodding on with him and we're hopeful he can pull through.

'He is completely deaf though - he only reacts when he sees you and doesn't hear you coming.

'He has started to eat a bit of hay now but he is still in a bad way.

'I would like to get hold of the people responsible for this and chop their ears off and see how they would like that.'

The RSPCA yesterday slammed the thugs who inflicted the 'horrific' attack on little Nelson.

Inspector Susan Hammond, who was called to attend the incident, said: 'This is absolutely horrific and I cannot believe that someone would deliberately cause such an awful injury to an innocent animal.

'Sadly as a result of the injury the mother abandoned the lamb.'

The attack took place in a remote field with no public right of way anyone with any information about the incident is asked to contact the RSPCA on 0300 123 8018.
