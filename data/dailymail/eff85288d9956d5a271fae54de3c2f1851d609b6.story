A vaccine against the human form of mad cow disease could be a step closer after scientists immunised deer against a similar illness.

The researchers say their breakthrough in the fight against chronic wasting disease (CWE), which affects captive deer across the U.S., could have wide implications for the medical world.

CWE and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), which has killed 177 Britons since 1995, are both fatal brain conditions which are thought to be caused by dangerous proteins known as prions.

Prions convert healthy proteins into a disease state which then affects the brain, causing a loss of balance, dementia and muscle twitching before vCJD patients die.

Led by experts at New York University's Langone Medical Centre, the team gave their experimental vaccine to five deer which were then exposed to prion-infected brain tissue.

They were housed together and monitored daily for signs of illness, including having biopsies taken of their tonsils and gut, while being given eight boosters over 11 months.

Eventually the deer started producing antibodies against the disease which could be detected in their saliva, blood and faeces, according to the study in the journal Vaccine.

Although four of the deer still developed the infection, it took 'significantly longer' than for a control group of six deer who were given a placebo.

The fifth deer which was given the vaccine remains infection-free, the scientists added.

To prepare the vaccine, the researchers inserted a prion-like protein into the genome of a neutralised salmonella bacterium.

The salmonella was then induced to produce an immune response in the gut, producing anti-prion antibodies.

They now claim their breakthrough could have two major implications.

The first would be to prevent CWE among captive deer in the U.S., where the disease also affects wild deer, elk, caribou and moose.

Vaccinating just a tenth of each herd could induce 'herd immunity' despite the disease being known to affect every animal where it breaks out, the researchers said.

The second implication - described as 'equally important' - would be to prevent human vCJD, where the vast majority of cases were recorded in Britain in the late 1990s and early 2000s. 

Professor Thomas Wisniewski, one of the study's leaders, said: 'Now that we have found that preventing prion infection is possible in animals, it's likely feasible in humans as well'.

Associate professor Fernando Goni added: 'Although our anti-prion vaccine experiments have so far been successful on mice and deer, we predict that the method and concept could become a widespread technique for not only preventing, but potentially treating many prion diseases.'

Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), better known as mad cow disease, broke out across Britain two decades ago and is believed to have led to the UK's 177 fatal cases of vCJD.

At its peak in 2000, 28 Britons died of the disease after eating beef products contaminated with brain or nervous tissue from cows infected with BSE.

After BSE was contained within cattle the number of human infections began to drop, and just one Briton has died of vCJD since the start of 2012.
