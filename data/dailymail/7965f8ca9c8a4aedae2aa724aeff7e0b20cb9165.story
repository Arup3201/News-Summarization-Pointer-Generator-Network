Podiatrist Steve Bloorwas told to leave his local Tesco store after a security guard stopped him entering

A podiatrist who walks everywhere in his bare feet was banned from his local branch of Tesco for refusing to wear shoes.

Steve Bloor, 48, believes walking without footwear is good for posture and general health and says shoes are unnecessary.

He has been walking everywhere barefoot for the last two years but was stunned when a security guard stopped him entering his local Tesco in Helston, Cornwall.

The manager intervened and explained the policy was in place in case anyone injured themselves walking around the shop.

But
father-of-four Mr Bloor criticised the rule: 'I should be able to be 
responsible enough to look after my bare feet as well as a guide dog 
does.

'It’s the healthiest way to walk and it strengthens your feet and connects you to the environment.

'I would like to see that there’s no discrimination and people are given the option of going barefoot.'

Mr Bloor is a qualified podiatrist of 27 years experience and runs the Run Right Step Free clinic in Helston.

He believes feet are much healthier without shoes and by going barefoot people can improve general health.

Mr
Bloor claims his foot hygiene is better than those who wear shoes and 
that people wearing flip-flops or high heels are more likely to have an 
accident.

He said his two boys, Elliot, 12 and Chris, 19, do not have a problem with going barefoot and often do it themselves, with Chris even going barefoot at University.

Mr Bloor said: 'When I first started 
going barefoot everyone thought I was mad, but now they have accepted it
and see it as acceptable as bare hands.

'People do not have to go around wearing gloves to cover up their hands so I don’t see why people should cover their feet.

'People are not offended if they see others wearing flip flops and that is just a piece of cord on their feet, but as soon as the feet are bare people generally do not like it.

'I have always thought that people needed to wear shoes as they can support your feet up to 80 per cent.

'However, then I read a book named Born To Run and it was about a barefoot runner.

After reading it I did a bit of research about barefoot walking and running and liked what I read.'

Amazingly, Mr Bloor said he has never had any injuries from going barefoot, and has only encountered a few splinters.

He has been shopping barefoot at the Tesco branch for years without incident but was suddenly blocked by a security guard on August 5.

Mr Bloor explained: 'When I got banned from Tesco I was pretty shocked, I had been going there for two years and spent hundreds of pounds.

'The security officer basically said there was glass everywhere and didn’t want me to end up suing Tesco.

'He went and got the manager - they 
were both very pleasant and agreed with me that it should not be an 
issue but they have a regional policy in case somebody claims against 
them for accidental damage.

'But
if you’re barefoot you’re more aware of your surroundings. I asked if 
they had a similar policy to ban guide dogs and they don’t ban toddlers 
from walking around with their hands on the floor.

'I think quite a lot of people in this part of the world go barefoot as there is a very outside way of life here.'

The father claims that people wearing flip-flops or high heels were more likely to have an accident, whereas he is more aware of his surroundings

However Mr Bloor, who also has two daughters Bethany, 15 and Lucy, 18, launched an appeal against the decision by Tesco.

After a ten-day period bosses agreed to make an exception to their barefoot policy and allow him back into the store.

A spokesman for Tesco said: 'We do tend to ask customers to put footwear on during the summer months, as a lot of them come straight from the beach and we want to stop sand spreading through the store.

'But we try to take a common sense approach and are happy to make an exception in Mr Bloor’s case.'

Mr Bloor said he would continue to campaign for anybody to be able to enter the store without shoes.
