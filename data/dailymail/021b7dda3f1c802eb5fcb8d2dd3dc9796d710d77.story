A Maryland mother is facing nearly a dozen charges after she forced her 14-year-old daughter to have sex with a man three times her age to settle a $5,000 debt.

Prosecutors say the woman, who hasn't been named, told the girl to perform sex acts with Bejarni Rivas, 44, between December 2012 and March 2013.

Each encounter allegedly wiped $100 off what she owed the Gaithersburg man. It's unclear what the debt was for.

According to court documents, the teen begged her mother not to make her go with Rivas.

But her mother responded: 'I've done bad things to make you have a good life. Go with him.'

The sexual abuse occurred more than once and allegedly took place at a property in Montgomery County.

It ended after the girl told another relative who alerted police, sparking the investigation.

The mother has been charged with 11 total counts, according to court documents. She claims that she did not know about the rape.

Jail: The mother remains in Montgomery County jail on a $275,000 bond while Rivas has posted bail. The daughter is safe with family members

Rivas has been indicted by a grand jury on 13 charges, including second degree rape, human trafficking and sexual abuse of a minor.

'These defendants are facing a long, long time behind bars,' said Ramon Korionoff from the Montgomery County State's Attorneys Office.

Officials say the girl, who hasn't been identified because she's the victim of sexual abuse, is now 15.

Attorney Walter Neighbors, who is listed in online court records as representing Rivas, said on Sunday that he did not have any comment on the case.

The mother remains in jail on a $275,000 bond while Rivas has posted bail. The daughter is safe with family members.
