Amanda Bynes has denied denied ever doing drugs after being charged in court for reckless endangerment.

She took to Twitter to plead her innocence hours after her turning up at a New York court in connection with claims she threw a marijuana bong out of her Manhattan apartment building.

The 27-year-old former child star, who looked dishevelled in a blonde wig and jogging bottoms, was arrested Thursday evening after building officials at her midtown apartment called police to complain she was rolling a joint and smoking cannabis in the lobby.

And while she made no formal plea at the appearance, she pleaded her innocence via her Twitter page and even reached for levity by making fun of her appearance.

The unpredictable former Nickelodeon favourite wrote: 'I only smoke tobacco I don't drink or do drugs. I've never had a bong in my life!

'I need to get another nose job after seeing my mugshot!'

However two shocking mug shots have since emerged of the former child star star.

She
 initially posed for a booking photo in her platinum blonde wig but was 
later forced to remove it - and reveal her shaved head - for her 
official police picture.

She scowled in both frames and appeared to have heavy bags under her eyes. Amanda announced she shaved half her 
head in April, claiming a hair stylist 'fried' it with bleach. It's unclear
 exactly when she cut off the rest of her long locks.

The officers went to her apartment on the 36th floor where they said they saw heavy smoke and a bong sitting on the kitchen counter. They said she tossed the bong out the window in front of them, prosecutors said.

A incident report quotes the officer as saying: 'I observed [Amanda] grab said bong, run to the westbound-facing window, and throw it out the window where numerous pedestrians were walking on the 8 Avenue and West 47 Street sidewalks below.'

She then said to police: 'It was just a vase,' according to Manhattan assistant district attorney Chikaelo Ibeabuchi.

Police returned to the apartment on Friday evening looking for more evidence and gathering witness statements, according to TMZ.

The night doorman and two other apartment building employees who were there when Bynes allegedly was smoking pot in the lobby gave statements to police.

Officers also went upstairs to the floor of Bynes' apartment seeking more witness statements.

With her lawyer: Her attorney says she absolutely denies the bong-toss incident

Bynes called authorities herself during the dramatic arrest, sources tell In Touch magazine.

'She called 911, saying cops were going to assault her,' an insider told the publication.

Her 
attorney for the arraignment Andrew Friedman told the court: 'My client completely denies illegally
 throwing anything out of her window.'

He claims she was illegally followed into her apartment by police.

The judge released her on her own recognizance and gave her a July 9 court date.

Friendly goodbye: She told the judge to 'have a nice day' after she was dismissed from court

Thursday, Bynes was held overnight at a
 police precinct. She pulled up to court Friday morning in a squad car 
where she was greeted by a crush of media. She was also charged with 
attempted tampering with evidence and unlawful possession of marijuana, 
all misdemeanors.

'I don't want any photos. No press are allowed in here,' she announced to the public courtroom.

Her lawyer said she had no record in 
New York, but the judge noted she had several out-of-state cases.

In 
California in December, the former Hairspray star resolved a 
misdemeanor hit-and-run case after entering into a civil settlement with
 other drivers.

Also in California, she was charged 
last fall with driving on a suspended license after it was temporarily 
taken away from her after two hit-and-run cases where she was accused of
 leaving the scene without providing proper information. She has also 
pleaded not guilty to drunken driving in a separate case.

Over: She was escorted out of the court house by police

Free to go: She left court alone in a taxi

Cover up: She used her fake hair to shield her face

Unkempt: Her pink fake nails were chipped off on some fingers

Hair-raising: Her wig was in quite a state as she headed home

Free to go: She was released without bail

In releasing her, Chief New York County Judge Neil Ross gave her a stern warning not to make trouble or miss any court dates.

'I do want to make sure you 
understand,' he said. 'If you get arrested again ... I'm going to be 
setting very, very significant bail.'

'OK,' she replied.

Back on twitter: After court, Amanda retweeted a fans pic of her with the acronym ILYSM (I love you so much)

'You're in a very, very challenging situation right now,' he said.

Assistant district attorney Ibeabuchi 
had asked for $1,000 bail. He said no bong was recovered from the street
 below - a sign, her attorney said, that Bynes was telling the truth.

'There was nothing recovered from the 
sidewalk, clearly a search was made for the bag,' said Friedman of the 
New York County Defender Services. He said she was followed illegally 
into her apartment and has made a complaint about police wrongfully 
entering.

Bowing her head: She hid her face as she arrived for the hearing

Trouble: The former child star was in handcuffs

As the judge dispensed with her case, she said, 'Thank you sir, have a nice day.'

The star then got into a waiting yellow cab ringed with photographers and TV cameras and left.

The former Nickelodeon star has
 been exhibiting erratic behaviour of late with some eyebrow-raising 
public outings and online postings.

Two men who claimed they attended an
 impromptu house party at Bynes' Manhattan apartment last month said 
they witnessed Bynes smoking marijuana atop a bare mattress in her 
bedroom.

The men told 
In Touch magazine in an article this week that Bynes' home was filthy 
and filled with marijuana, presenting photos to back up their claims.

The men said that Bynes' home was virtually unfurnished and windows were spray painted black.

Bynes 
jumped to her own defense on Wednesday night on Twitter. She posted a 
tweet saying: 'That’s not my bed! Those aren’t my toes! My toes are 
pedicured!'

In another strange incident, TMZ 
reported on Thursday that Bynes was stopped from boarding a private jet 
last weekend for not having correct identification.

Since her driver's license has been 
suspended and she had no other form of ID, the actress told the pilot to
 search her name on Google to prove her identity.

The pilot 
checked with the jet company, but they were adamant that no special 
treatment be given and Bynes was not allowed on the flight.

Her bizarre antics commenced with her retirement from acting and move last year to New York.

She is regularly on Twitter and has sent out some concerning 
tweets in which she asked Drake to 'murder her vagina' and posed topless
 while complaining about her weight.

TMZ reported 
earlier this year Amanda was evicted from her apartment for being a 
'building nuisance,' as neighbours complained about smelling marijuana 
smoke from her abode.

The 
Easy A actress moved to the Big Apple to become a fashion designer last 
year, but the fruits of her labour have yet to surface.

She also didn't have much luck with her 2007 clothing line, Dear, after retailer Steve & Barry's filed for bankruptcy.

Amanda's concerned parents are said to be trying to get her placed under a conservatorship.

Rick and Lynn Bynes have reportedly 
visited several lawyers in a bid to sign over all legal, medical and 
financial control of her affairs to an external party.

Her parents' attempts have been unsuccessful so far, however.

Movie star: Amanda starred in the 2003 film What A Girl Wants with Colin Firth

A source told RadarOnline.com: 'Rick 
and Lynn have met with several lawyers that handle conservatorships in 
the past month, because they want to get a conservatorship of their 
daughter. They have been advised that even as disturbing as Amanda's 
behaviour is, it's very unlikely that a judge would sign off on a 
temporary conservatorship.

'Conservatorships are very hard to 
get, and being mentally ill and addicted to drugs isn't enough. Amanda 
hasn't ever been to rehab or ever agreed to see a mental health 
professional. Her parents are absolutely powerless to do anything at 
this point.'

Bynes' unraveling is reminiscent of another former child star - Britney Spears, who also shaved her head in 2007.

The pop star's father was granted a court-ordered conservatorship following the public meltdown.
