Victim: Nanny Teresita Sison worked at a house near to where she was killed on Tuesday

Police could face an investigation by the independent watchdog after failing to place a cordon around a storm-damaged tree after a pedestrian was killed.

Nanny Teresita Sison died after the tree was uprooted opposite Knightsbridge Barracks, Kensington, during high winds caused by the remnants of Hurricane Gonzalo earlier this week.

The 58-year-old was killed on the spot when masonry was dislodged by a falling tree and collapsed on to the pavement on Kensington Road. 

The Metropolitan Police said that the incident was being reviewed by the Major Crime Unit, while the Independent Police Complaints Commission has also been contacted. 

Officers were called to reports of a partially fallen tree shortly after 11am on Tuesday, as winds of up to 108mph and heavy rain battered the UK.

Police said vehicle cordons were put in place to redirect traffic, but admitted that pedestrians were still able to access the pavement below. 

Around 30 minutes after officers arrived, a supporting wall collapsed and the tree slipped further - moving the brick that crushed Mrs Sison as she passed underneath.

Detectives are now asking for anyone who may have recorded mobile phone footage of the incident to get in touch.

A post-mortem examination is due to take place at Westminster Mortuary tomorrow.

Mrs Sison, originally from the Philippines, worked at a house near where she was killed. 

The nanny, who first came to the UK in the 1980s, also worked as a beautician and a cook alongside working for a family who lived close to the scene.

Probe: Police could now face an investigation after they failed to properly limit access to the scene on Tuesday

Yesterday, Mrs Sison's cousin Efiliciano Quimbao, 63, described her as the 'breadwinner' of the family, adding that her husband Roberto was 'really devastated' by her death.

Speaking at the scene of her death, Mr Quimbao said: 'She was such a lovely woman, she was a hard worker, she always wanted to provide for her family back home.

'She was the breadwinner, she worked for one family, cared for their children while they grew up and now they are at university, everyone will be sad.'

Clean-up: Emergency workers clear the scene where Mrs Sison was killed by the falling tree on Tuesday

Elsewhere a man was crushed to death underneath a van in Canvey, Essex, after a van fell on top of him. The victim, in his thirties, was underneath the van repairing it when a strong gust of wind caused it to fall off a car jack at 10.40am. 

Another man, 63, was killed after his car hit a bridge near Merseyside, Liverpool, on Tuesday. At the time of the crash the area was experiencing gusts of up to 35mph and heavy rain as the tail end of Hurricane Gonzalo blew ashore.

Police are now appealing for anyone with information on the circumstances surrounding Mrs Sison's death to come forward. 

Detective Inspector Dave Bolton, of Westminster Police's major crime unit, said: 'I would appeal to anyone with information to come forward as it may be vital to piece together what happened.

'There were many people in the area at the time and these witnesses could hold key information.'

Anyone with information is asked to call the police non-emergency line on 101. 

Admission: Police said that they had redirected traffic around the damaged tree, pictured, but had not cordoned off the pavement where Mrs Sison was later crushed to death
