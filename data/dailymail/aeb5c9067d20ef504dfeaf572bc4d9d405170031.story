Shocking failings in NHS care for diabetes patients are today exposed by figures revealing that 120 amputations take place every week.

Officials say GPs are not monitoring patients properly or giving them vital advice on how to keep their condition under control.

And each week, diabetes leads to a staggering 268 heart attacks, 325 strokes, 143 cases of kidney failure and 385 early deaths, according to other figures in the report.

Officials say GPs are not monitoring patients with diabetes properly or giving them vital advice on how to keep their condition under control, leading to 120 amputations being carried out every week

The number of Britons with the condition has doubled in 20 years mainly due to obesity, causing an increase in people developing type 2 diabetes, and today it affects 3.8million. One in seven patients in hospital has the illness, and it costs the NHS £14billion a year.

Nearly 90 per cent of patients with the condition have type 2 diabetes, which is usually caused by obesity. 

Yet the report by Public Health England warns that GP surgeries are not doing enough to help combat the condition.

On average, just 36 per cent of diabetes patients are keeping their blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol at safe levels.

All of this can be regulated by insulin injections, other medication or through simple lifestyle advice on weight loss, diet and exercise.

But in some areas – including  West Suffolk – the proportion of patients who have their diabetes under control falls to 28 per cent.

John Newton of Public Health England, the agency responsible for tackling health issues such as diabetes, said: ‘We need to create a sense of urgency in dealing with these future health problems which are facing our communities. Some practices are achieving good control but there is too much variation. ‘Practices are not being systematic enough about bringing patients in regularly and recording what investigations they’ve had done.’

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘We know that diabetes can have a devastating impact on people and we want everybody to get excellent care and support, regardless of where they live.’ 

They do not produce enough insulin and this causes their blood sugar to rise, leading to nerve damage.

This can result in foot sores and amputations, blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks and strokes. The report shows that last year diabetes led to 6,298 amputations, 13,947 heart attacks, 16,910 strokes and 7,447 patients needing kidney dialysis or transplant.

Barbara Young, chief executive of charity Diabetes UK, said: ‘This is just the latest in a long line of statistics that show that diabetes healthcare is hugely geographically variable and in many places is not good enough.

‘The public deserve more than politicians and NHS leaders wringing their hands about it but then failing to do anything meaningful to try to fix it.’

Martin McShane, of NHS England, which runs the health service, said: ‘A healthy lifestyle in adults at high risk of diabetes can halve the likelihood of suffering from the condition, but there is also a need for NHS England to support evidence-based treatment shaped to support individuals.’
