The scorer of the most important goal in Chelsea’s history is how Jose Mourinho described him this week and on Friday a deal was completed to bring him back to his spiritual football home. Didier Drogba is a Blue once more.

At 36 his powers may have diminished a little, but Drogba is someone who remains valuable to a man of Mourinho’s considerable ambition.

In a season when the Portuguese wants 
to guide Chelsea to a third Barclays Premier League title under his 
leadership, a player who was so central to the first two will certainly 
be useful to have around.

Clearly,
 Mourinho values Drogba in the same way Sir Alex Ferguson liked to have 
players such as Ryan Giggs at Old Trafford. Not just for his experience 
but for his desire to see the club succeed; a desire that the younger 
players can draw on.

In keeping with Chelsea’s policy for older players, Drogba has signed a one-year contract.

Mourinho,
 who revealed his desire to sign Drogba for a second time in Austria on 
Thursday, said on Friday: ‘He’s coming because he’s one of the best 
strikers in Europe.

'I 
know his personality very well and I know if he comes back he’s not 
protected by history or what he’s done for this club previously. He is 
coming with the mentality to make more history.’

A Chelsea statement  celebrated the return of a player voted the greatest in the club’s history by supporters in October 2012.

‘When
 he came to the end of his previous contract in 2012 it was only weeks 
after he had stroked the ball from the penalty spot into the Bayern 
Munich net to place Chelsea on top of the European summit for the first 
time,’ it read.

‘His earlier
 equalising header in that Champions League final was his 157th goal in 
341 appearances, a total placing him fourth in the club’s all-time 
highest-scorer list.’ On signing his contract, Drogba said: ‘It was an 
easy decision. I couldn’t turn down the opportunity to work with Jose 
again.

‘Everyone knows the special relationship I have with this club and it has always felt like home to me.

‘My
 desire to win is still the same and I look forward to the opportunity 
to help this team. I am excited for this next chapter of my career.’

Drogba
 will play the role of understudy to new signing Diego Costa but the 
Spain star is sure to be impressed by his new colleague’s record at 
Stamford Bridge — not least the 34 goals in European competition that 
remains a Chelsea record, and the nine strikes in nine cup finals.

In eight years he won three  Premier League titles, four FA Cups, two League Cups and the Champions League.

‘He
 returned to Chelsea last  season with Galatasaray in the Champions 
League, and was left in no doubt then of his enduring  popularity with 
the supporters.
