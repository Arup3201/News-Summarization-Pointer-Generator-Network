The short-term housing rental service Airbnb has paid back taxes that ran into the millions of dollars to the city of San Francisco, the company said yesterday.

The popular San Francisco-based company said in a statement that it has paid in full a back-tax bill. A spokesman declined to say how much the company paid.

City Treasurer Jose Cisneros ruled in 2012 that Airbnb owed back taxes. He  declined to reveal how much money he collected from Airbnb, saying local law mandates confidentiality on all tax matters.

Tourist hot spot: Airbnb is believed to have paid the city of San Francisco an estimated $25million to clear back hotel taxes that had threatened to undermine its support among local people and politicians

Officials had estimated that Airbnb owed the city as much as $25 million, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

The back-tax issue had threatened to unravel legislation that the supervisors passed last year legalizing short-term home rentals in the city. The law mandated that Airbnb pay the city's hotel tax going forward, but it didn't address issue of back taxes.

The law, which took effect February 1, allows only permanent residents to offer short-term rentals; it requires hosts register with the city and get a business license and permit; and it mandates the collection of hotel tax. 

It also limits entire-home rentals to 90 days per year, requires each listing to carry $500,000 in liability insurance, and establishes guidelines for enforcement by the Planning Department.

David Campos, a member of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors, who had campaigned on the back taxes issue, called the announcement 'a major victory'.

'We are glad they did this, but I don’t know if congratulations are in order for someone who paid their taxes three years late,' he told the San Francisco Chronicle.

But he said he and other critics of the Airbnb business model would continue to pressure the company over its impact on housing stock. They had worried the short-term rental marketplace was harming residential neighborhoods and subverting the city's rent controls.

San Francisco sights: Critics had complained that Airbnb-style rentals were turning city neighborhoods into de facto hotels, worsening a housing shortage by keeping badly needed rental homes off the market

Along with Uber and others, Airbnb has been a flagship of the so-called 'sharing economy', with some economists saying such 'peer to peer' models tap underused resources and encourage more people to become entrepreneurs.

But it has sparked complaints from the hotel sector, which argued it doesn't have to meet the same requirements for licensing, safety and insurance, making the competition unfair.

In San Francisco, critics had complained that Airbnb-style rentals were turning neighborhoods into de facto hotels, worsening a housing shortage by keeping badly needed rental homes off the market.

The same gripes are being felt coast to coast. Proponents and critics crowded a New York City Council hearing last month to argue over whether Airbnb saps housing affordability of helps it.

On one side were tenants who say landlords are illegally turning their homes into de facto hotels by renting apartments to high-paying tourists instead of full-time residents.

On the other were homeowners and tenants who say Airbnb provides crucial income in a city where even a studio apartment can easily top $2,000 a month.

The debate is perhaps most pointed in New York, where Mayor Bill de Blasio has made affordable housing a centerpiece of his agenda.

But his San Francisco counterpart, Mayor Ed Lee, seemed at least partly satisfied with Airbnb, saying it's back taxes payment showed the company 'embraces the values of its hometown and the importance of being a good corporate citizen.'

'This will mean millions of dollars today and going forward in revenue for the city to fund affordable housing, public safety and other vital city services,' he was quoted by the Chronicle as saying.
