A castle that was Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother’s beloved Highland hideaway is being rented out to paying guests — at the price of £50,000 for a long weekend.

It is the first time that a royal residence has ever been let out.

The Castle of Mey was the only residence directly owned by Queen Elizabeth.

Over the decades, she filled her holiday home with distinctive knick-knacks and personal flourishes.

Now, 12 years after her death, the castle in the north of Scotland is being let out to carefully-vetted guests.

The Mail on Sunday understands that for £50,000 up to a dozen people can spend a long weekend in the imposing 16th Century building where Prince Charles is still a regular visitor.

The Queen’s own party planner provides a full programme of events for guests to enjoy, including stalking and salmon fishing.

The one room guests cannot stay in - Her late Majesty's bedroom in the Castle of Mey, the most northerly castle in Britain

The Castle of Mey was first seen by Queen Elizabeth in 1952 when she was mourning the death of her husband HM King George VI. It was the only residence she privately owned

Guests can eat at the same dining table used by Queen Elizabeth, and sit in her favourite chair.

On the dining room walls are landscapes painted by Prince Philip.

The drawing room has a carpet that was given to Queen Elizabeth in 1990 by her daughter the Queen as a 90th birthday present.

Castle managing director Shirley Farquhar said: ‘As soon as you walk  in, you can feel the Queen Mother’s presence, as it was her home.’

The one part of the castle that is off limits is the late queen’s bedroom.

The weekends have been introduced as a fund-raising venture by the Queen Elizabeth Castle of Mey Trust – of which Prince Charles is President – which owns the castle and runs it in memory of his grandmother.

The ‘Mey Occasions’ (as the weekends are dubbed by the trust) are not advertised. Instead, invitations are extended to a small circle of wealthy business-people and philanthropists.

The trust plans just ‘two or three’ weekends a year. A trial weekend was run last October in which selected guests stayed for free.

Last month, the first paying guests were the family and friends of a foreign businessman, who re-booked for next year. The next guests – in October – are American.

Numbers are limited to no more than 12 guests, served by a staff of 20, some flown up from London.

The breaks are designed by Royal party planner Lady Elizabeth Anson, an honorary patron of the trust.

Amid the royal grandeur of the Castle of Mey, a curious selection of tacky knick-knacks are testament to the late Queen’s sense of fun and mischief.

Her delight in such novelties was well-known and her Private Secretary, Sir Martin Gilliat, would encourage guests, especially the young royals, to bring back unusual souvenirs for their hostess.

In the drawing room above a 16th Century Flemish tapestry, is a small Loch Ness monster cuddly toy in a tartan dress , while on the mantelpiece lies a porcelain figure of a drunken Scotswoman clinging to a lamppost.

Elsewhere, there’s a ceramic bagpiper (above right), a wooden axe-wielding clansman  and toy versions of a sheep (right), a Highland cow and a haggis.

Lady Elizabeth organised a dinner for 40 members of the Royal family  on the eve of the Duke and Duchess  of Cambridge’s wedding.

Sir Mick Jagger, President and Mrs Clinton and the late Baroness Thatcher have also asked her to organise parties.

Inside, the castle has had a £250,000 makeover, overseen by former Olympic skier Baron Piers Von Westenholz, a close friend of Prince Charles.

Ashe Windham, who served as the Queen Elizabeth’s equerry at the castle – and is now chairman of Mey Trust – said the venture would help the castle meet its running costs and was a fitting honour to the late queen.

He added: ‘A complete makeover was finished in April. This was long overdue, as the place was beginning  to take on a careworn air.’

Queen Elizabeth first saw what was then Barrogill Castle in 1952, while mourning her husband, King George VI.

Falling for its isolated charm, she bought the most northerly  castle on the British mainland, restored it and created beautiful walled gardens.

Queen Elizabeth, who died in March 2002, aged 101, enjoyed a low-key lifestyle there. Even the ancient refrigerator she refused to part with still works perfectly 60 years on.
