Police have revealed that the couple whose candle-lit marriage proposal was caught on a helicopter night vision camera from the sky are to marry.

The words ‘will you marry me’ were written in flames as the Metropolitan Police’s helicopter flew over a north-west London's Gladstone Park near midnight on Saturday.

Remarkably, even though it was pitch black, the helicopter’s heat sensitive camera captured the author of the message down on one knee - apparently proposing to his partner.
