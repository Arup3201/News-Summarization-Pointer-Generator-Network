Tragedy: Care worker Danielle Wrighton, 22, from North Wales, was killed instantly in a car crash when she smashed into a Tesco delivery van

A 'bubbly and popular' care worker has died after a head-on crash with a supermarket delivery van.

Danielle Wrighton was killed instantly when her Ford Focus hit a Mercedes Tesco truck near Llandegla, Denbighshire, 
North Wales on Sunday.

The 22-year-old had just completed her first year as a support worker for people with learning disabilities when the tragedy happened.

Friends and colleagues have paid moving tributes to 'caring and smiling' Danielle.

Heartbroken brother Sion Price said online: 'I would give the world to have my sister back, she's an angel in heaven now.

'She never did anything bad to anyone and I'm devastated - my right arm is missing.

'RIP Dani, I love you to bits.'

Local councillor and family friend Eryl Jones-Williams said: 'There is a dark cloud over the village at the loss of a bubbly and attractive young lady who always had the time to say hello.

'My sympathy that of the whole community go to her mother Iona, and all her family at this time.

'Danielle worked as a carer to make sure that the elderly and disabled who needed assistance were cared for.

'That showed what kind of young lady she was. The loss of someone so young is devastating.

'I have not spoken to Danielle's family, but I am sure they know that the thoughts of the whole community are with them at this time.'

Ann Lees, training manager at Treherne Care, said: 'Danielle was a very valued employee and we are all shocked at the tragic loss.

'She was very popular with staff and clients.'

Danielle's parents Iona and George were 'too distraught' to talk about their tragic loss and are being supported at home by police.

North Wales Police said Danielle lived with her parents in Dyffryn Ardudwy, Gwynedd, North Wales, and her brothers Haydn and Sion lived locally.

Firefighters used cutting gear to release a 'seriously injured' 22-year-old woman passenger in Danielle's car - and the Wales Air Ambulance flew her to hospital in Stoke.

A North Wales Police spokesman said the delivery van driver sustained minor injuries and was taken to Wrexham Maelor Hospital by ambulance.

He said a crash investigation was underway to discover the cause of the collision.
