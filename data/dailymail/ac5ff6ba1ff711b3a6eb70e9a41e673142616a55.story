The spectacular stately home given to Sir Christopher Wren as payment for designing St Paul's Cathedral has gone on sale for £4.25million.

The famed architect, who also designed Royal Naval College in Greenwich, was handed a 50-year lease on the Hampton property by Queen Anne in 1708, in lieu of salary arrears for building the world famous church that is due to be used for Margaret Thatcher's funeral next week.

Wren's former home has an English Heritage blue plaque dedicated to the architect, who was a Royal Surveyor for 49 years.

In 1706, he carried out an almost complete overhaul of the house, which is the only period home on Hampton Court Green other than Hampton Court Palace, with a garden stretching down to the Thames.

Matthew Abernethy, director of Savills in Richmond, which is selling the property, said: 'He was owed wages for designing St Paul's Cathedral so rather than paying his salary arrears they gave home a 50 year lease on this property.

The six-bedroom house has three bathrooms, three/four reception rooms, a kitchen/breakfast room, cellars, garage for at least two cars and a river mooring

The estate agent handling the sale said: 'You could not put a contemporary financial figure on it. Now you would say priceless'

Architecture wasn't the only discipline Oxford graduate and former Westminster School pupil Sir Christopher Wren put his powers to.

Wren was a pioneer across the scientific spectrum and responsible for several inventions.

After graduation, Wren worked on astronomy research and 
became a Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College in London and later 
at Oxford.

As an astronomer, he developed exceptional skills working 
with models and diagrams, experimenting with creative ideas, and 
engaging in scientific reasoning.

Wren built a transparent beehive to help study bees, invented a weather clock similar to a barometer, invented an instrument for writing in the dark and developed improvements in the telescope and the microscope.

He also experimented with injecting fluids into the veins of animals and laying the groundwork for successful blood transfusion and constructed a detailed model of the moon.

'Houses of this ilk are few and far 
between. I can see someone getting emotionally engaged by it, with all 
its fabulous historical features.'

He
said of the price for Wren's work on St Paul's: 'You could not put a 
contemporary financial figure on it. Now you would say priceless.'

The study, formerly the dining room, 
is panelled in wood by Wren himself, and also includes the same marble 
fireplace he put in for King William III in Hampton Court Palace.

Mr
Abernethy added: 'He immediately got to work designing and adding 
features. He obviously liked the fire place he built for King William 
because he straight away built one for himself.

'He did lots of bits and piece on the place and it remains a remarkable property.'

He would not say whether the firm had had any interest from well known names, such as the Beckhams, who were house hunting the area last year.

He said: 'We never disclose information of that sort. I do however think this property will appeal to a wide range of buyers, well a range of buyers who can afford to spend £4.25m on a property.

'There is a mooring at the bottom of the garden so whoever does buy it will be able to jump on their boat and totter up the Thames to work.'

The six-bedroom house has three bathrooms, three/four reception rooms, a kitchen/breakfast room, cellars, garage for at least two cars and a river mooring.
