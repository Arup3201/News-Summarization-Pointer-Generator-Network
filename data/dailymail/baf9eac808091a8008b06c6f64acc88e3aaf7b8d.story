Troubled Toronto mayor Rob Ford is being treated in a residential treatment program for substance abuse at a clinic in the US, his brother revealed Friday.

Councillor Doug Ford spoke at the end week of a chaotic week for the Ford camp and amid wild speculation about Mayor Ford’s whereabouts.

He told Canada’s CBC News that Ford checked in to the clinic on Thursday last week, a fact verified by a supervising doctor at the facility.

Treatment: Doug Ford told reporters that his brother, Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, checked into rehab on Thursday

The health care provider, speaking on consent from the mayor, told CBC News that Ford enrolled in an in-patient program and remains under their care.

Ford left the clinic last Saturday after a medical exam and was taken to hospital where he was admitted for four days before returning on May 7, to the same treatment facility.

The doctor revealed that while in hospital Ford received ‘concurrent care’ with the treatment facility.

‘I have every assurance and confidence he was nowhere else,’ the doctor said.

The confirmation that Mayor Ford is under going rehab comes amid a week of frenzied rumour and speculation, including several so called sightings of the mayor in the Toronto area.

‘Mayor Rob Ford has been under medical care 24-7 from the time he arrived in Canada, from Chicago, and he has been getting treatment,’ Councillor Doug Ford told CBC News Friday evening.

The location of the treatment facility is being kept secret out of consideration for the privacy and confidentiality of Ford and other patients and staff.

Doug says he hopes the move will quell speculation and stop some media organizations trying to spot Ford at the facility.

‘That would be a tragedy for 20 to 25 families that are there, trying to get help, trying to get treatment," said Ford.‘They don't want to disclose their locations or their identities. I think it would be a tragedy if the media swarmed in on a treatment centre and started taking pictures and started disclosing locations of other patients.’

Doug had promised to provide 'proof' that his brother was indeed going through treatment for alcoholism.

He kept media organisations, many camped out outside his City Hall office, waiting all day.

The information did not emerge until around 9pm Friday.

Out of control: In his latest embarrassment, Ford was videotaped stumbling around a bar and ranting about beating someone up

Doug made the statement as a new video emerged of his troubled brother where the mayor is seen stumbling around drunk in a bar and ranting: 'No one better f*** with me....I'm going to kick you in the f****** head.'

Meanwhile, his colleagues on city council have said they're doubtful he's in rehab.

Coun. Joe Mihevc has been one of the most vocal in calling for proof the mayor is getting treatment.

‘For that political redemption story to be born, he has to provide proof that it’s warranted,’ Mihevc said.‘I don’t know what that proof is. The onus is on him to provide that proof for Torontonians to believe him.’

Mayor Ford has not been seen for a week since taking a leave of absence to deal with his alcohol and crack-smoking addictions.

The new video, which was posted on the Toronto Sun's website, was reportedly shot in a Toronto bar on April 27 - in the same three-day period where videos also emerged of Ford making lewd, drunken remarks about a female politician in a bar and another of him smoking a purported crack pipe in his sister's basement.

Citizens of Canada's largest city have been dubious their mayor is where he says he is, with sightings of Ford around town reaching fevered levels as members of the public upload pictures to Twitter of lookalikes.

Doug had earlier said that allegations the mayor has been out of the supervision of healthcare professionals or has been seen in cars or coffee shops were completely false, maintaining he has not once been in public since he went into rehab last week.

'Since the day he went in, he has never been out in public,' he said.

Ever since he went in to seek help last week, Doug said the mayor has been taking it seriously.

'He has at all times been under the supervision of medical professionals and never once been alone one day in treatment,' he said.

Doug also denied claims that the mayor was away from rehab for three days this week — possibly in Muskoka, a small town north of Toronto.

In an interview earlier this week, Ford said: ‘there are two doctors here, a captain of industry and a professional athlete.’
