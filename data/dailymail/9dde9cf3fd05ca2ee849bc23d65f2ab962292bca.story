Taya Kyle, the widow of Chris Kyle, is revealing details from the couple's wedding - and the touching phrase he had inscribed inside her wedding ring.

'One of the lines in our wedding vows was, 'I will remind you who you are when you forget,' revealed Taya in an interview with People, which hits newsstands this Friday.

She then added that inside her wedding ring, Chris, the subject for the new film American Sniper, had inscribed; 'All of me. My love, my life.'

This after Taya says she spent most of the time her husband served overseas afraid he would not return home to her and their 

'I had so much practice of being afraid Chris was dead, hearing the gunfights on the phone when I called him overseas,' she explains.

That being said, he still amde time for romance, with Taya saying he would send emails that said; 'I just want to be home with you.' 

His commitment to his work also made life difficult for her and the couple's two children, with Taya admitting they sometimes 'felt like we were less important than the military.'

Things also became difficult when Chris returned home.

'There were times we did not think we were going to make it,' says Taya.

Now, Taya is at work on her own book, American Widow, and wishing that Chris were still around to see the response to Sniper, which was recently nominated for six Academy Awards, including nods for Best Picture and Best Actor for Bradley Cooper's portrayal of Chris. 

'It makes me emotional when i think about how he would react, because I want him here.'

And while Taya is sure Chris would be in awe of the film, she also feels her humble husband would feel a little weird as well with everyone talking about him.

'I can see him being uncomfortable with all the attention,' says Taya.

'All of me. My love, my life,' wrote Chris inside Taya's weddign ring (above with Cooper at the film's premiere)

The film tells the story of her husband who was raised in rural Texas and started out working as a cowboy.

He applied to join the SEALs but was turned down because a rodeo accident had left him with metal pins in his arms.

However, in the late Nineties, the unit relaxed its entrance requirements and Kyle was put through the fearsomely tough selection and training regime.

In 2003, he was deployed to Iraq where he made his first long-distance kills even though he had not been trained as sniper.

Spotting his obvious talent, the military sent him to SEAL sniper school, where he was taught how to perform warfare's loneliest and most controversial job.

In 2004, Kyle was posted to Fallujah, west of Baghdad and a major battleground of Iraqi insurgency, and it was during the battle for that city where he first made his mark.

However, it was in 2006 in Ramadi, a city in central Iraq, that Mr Kyle gained his nickname as 'The Legend' from his fellow SEALs.

One day, while positioned on a roof, Kyle watched a moped coming down a street. Riding it were two men, one of whom dropped a backpack into a pothole.

Realising that it contained an improvised explosive, Kyle took a shot at the speeding moped from a range of 150 yards. The bullet hit one of the riders, passed through him, and hit the other.

In 2009, after four tours of Iraq, Kyle retired. He had not only shot more of the enemy than any other American sniper but had also gained himself a chestful of medals, including three Silver Stars for gallantry.

In February 2013 he and a friend, Chad Littlefield, took 25-year old Eddie Ray Routh to a remote shooting range in Glen Rose, Texas.

Before they reached the range Routh, 25, shot both men dead and stole Kyle's customized pick up truck.

Routh's family claimed he was suffering from PTSD and had mental issues. His trial on two murder charges begins in February.
