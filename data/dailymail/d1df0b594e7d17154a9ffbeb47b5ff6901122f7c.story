Toni Kroos has leapt to team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo's defence after the forward came under scrutiny for going out partying just hours after Real Madrid's 4-0 derby defeat to Atletico on February 7. 

Ronaldo, who had turned 30 two days earlier, was pictured in a night-club, going ahead with his birthday celebrations despite his team's humbling result. 

He and other players, including James Rodriguez, Kevon Rodlan, Pepe, Marcelo and Sami Khedira were widely condemned by fans and the media alike after photographs from the festivities were leaked online.

But Kroos, has rejected the criticism and insisting the three-time Ballon d'Or winner is a model professional and that a lot of the hubub  is undeserved. 

'I can only say positive things about him. He has a very good character,' Kroos told Goal.com 

'There are certainly many people who would have slacked off after all of the success that Cristiano has enjoyed, but he did not. 

'He always wants to win. Cristiano is addicted to goals and victories.'

Since joining Real Madrid from Manchester United in 2009, Ronaldo has scored 288 goals in 279 appearances 

Toni Kroos says that strict disciplinarian Carlo Ancelotti would not allow his players to become 'divas'

Kroos was also keen to quash any perceptions that there was a growing celebrity culture at Real Madrid. 

'Our coach, Carlo Ancelotti, would never accept that,' he said, 'You would win nothing like that.'  

'To put it bluntly: with us, nobody takes themselves too seriously. There are no divas. We are a functioning family.

'In the dressing room, there are great people with big hearts and open ears. Nobody here thinks that they can do it all on their own.'

Kroos joined Real from Bayern Munich last summer for a reported £24 million fee and has so far made 36 appearances in his debut season for the club.
