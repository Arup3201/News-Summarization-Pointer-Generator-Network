A family’s £500,000 dream home has been demolished after it breached planning rules by being built 6ft too high by bungling builders.

The four-bedroom house, in East Dunbartonshire, Scotland, was flattened in just a day after it was built 6ft higher, 9ft longer and 4ft wider than originally applied for by car sales manager Andrew Murray and his wife Frances.

Mr Murray, 51, paid £164,000 for the building plot and spent a further £300,000 building the ‘dream home’ despite not having a permit or approved planning permission.

The four-bedroom house, in East Dunbartonshire, Scotland, was flattened in just a day after it was built 6ft higher, 9ft longer and 4ft wider than originally applied for by car sales manager Andrew Murray

The local council rejected Mr Murray's planning application because his house exceeded size guidelines

He splashed out on a fully-fitted 
designer kitchen at a cost of £27,000 and spent £25,000 putting four 
bathrooms into the property and hoped the council would grant planning 
permission retrospectively.

However,
 East Dunbartonshire Council ruled the house had to be demolished for 
breaching planning regulations and for not being in line with local plan
 policy.

Council planners said the property was built larger than the plans stated, had too many windows and an unapproved 13ft balcony.

The original plans for the house also stated it was to be only two floors high, but an unapproved third floor was later added.

Fences were erected around the house two weeks ago but the house was torn down today after a digger was brought in to flatten the building.

Neighbour John Houston, 76, welcomed the demolition and said the ‘eyesore’ had blighted the area since it was put up.

He added: ‘I’m so glad to see it gone. It was an absolute eyesore and blocked the sunlight getting into my house and my garden.

‘I woke up the other day and thought the bedroom light was on but it was just the sunlight coming in the window.

‘We haven’t had that for four or five years because it was blocked out by that building.

‘You would look out my windows at that side of the property and just see a wall which wasn’t good.

‘I have never seen the man who owned it anywhere near the house.

‘There is now a massive pile of rubble where the house was and I’ve been told that it has to stay there for three days before they start removing it and that will apparently take them into next week.

‘Nobody bothered about the neighbours when it was built and it has been empty ever since going up.

‘I’m delighted it’s gone and we can get things back to normal.’

Mr Murray, who currently lives with his wife, 53, and their family in Strathaven, Lanarkshire, was forced to pay £11,500 to have the property demolished.

It has been claimed the family will now have to sell their current £350,000 home to meet their debts.

Ahead of the demolition, Mr Murray said: 'It’s a disaster for us. We’ll be out on the street.

'I don’t blame the council. They have exhausted every other avenue.'

Mr Murray said that some of the interior fittings inside the property had been removed prior to its demolition and said it had been broken into and vandalised

The family blamed bungling builders for the incorrect measurements of the property, saying he left the project in the hands of architects and builders who ‘failed to follow the plans’.

In a letter to planners at East Dunbartonshire Council, the father-of-three wrote that he had put ‘trust and faith in the professionalism of our friend who we understood to be a reputable builder who would oversee the project on our behalf.’

He added: ‘However, it is now evident we were too trustworthy and that we did not give the project the attention that we should have.’

Diane Campbell, East Dunbartonshire Council’s director of governance and regulation, said: ‘Formal enforcement was agreed in September 2013 and work to bring the house down has now begun.’

Thomas Glen, the council’s head of development and enterprise, said the house differed ‘considerably’ from the initial planning application.

He said: 'The house as constructed differs considerably from a previously-approved scheme, is not in line with local plan policy and guidance, and raises considerable amenity and potential precedent issues.’

Mr Murray claims builders Textura and the architects told him the home would meet council regulations and planning consent would be given retrospectively.

But in the two years it took for the house to be built, neither planning permission nor a building warrant was successfully obtained.

The property also lacked an electricity supply, plumbing and a waste water system.

The builders have since gone bankrupt and it is thought subcontractors were not paid and stripped out fixtures and fittings.

The house was also broken into and vandalised before it was flattened.

Mr Murray said: 'The whole thing has had a terrible effect on my family. It is a financial catastrophe.

'To invest all this money in a new home and lose it, and lose my old home because of the huge debts is beyond a nightmare.

'We were never rich. But we worked hard to attain what we thought was a comfortable position. All of that is gone now and we don’t know where to turn.'

Mr Murray used Textura UK Ltd to build the house which used CRGP Ltd Architects and Surveyors to lodge the unsuccessful planning application with East Dunbartonshire Council.

According to company records, the building firm Textura UK Ltd is in 'voluntary creditors' liquidation' and not able to comment.

A spokesperson for the architect firm CRGP said: 'We cannot make any comment at this time.'

Fences were put up around the property two weeks ago and the roof was carefully removed ahead of today's demolition

Council officials objected to the large balcony at the rear or the property and claimed if they allowed it to remain it would set a precedent
