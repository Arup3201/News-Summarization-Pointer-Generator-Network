Convicted: Sheila Kearns, 58, was convicted in January of four felony counts, for showing students at Columbus' East High School in Ohio, the movie 'The ABCs of Death'

A former substitute teacher convicted of showing a high school class a movie featuring graphic scenes of sex and violence has been sentenced  to 90 days in jail.

Sheila Kearns, 58, was convicted in January of four felony counts, for showing students at Columbus' East High School in Ohio, the movie 'The ABCs of Death.'

During sentencing, Kearns apologized in court, saying she hadn't watched the violent movie before showing it to her Spanish class in April 2013.

Common Pleas Judge Charles A. Schneider said: 'This is what happens when you put a teacher in a class that she cannot teach.'

The film consisted of 26 chapters, each depicting some form of grisly death and representing a letter of the alphabet, such as 'E is for Exterminate,' 'O is for Orgasm' and 'T is for Toilet.'

Kearns, who showed the movie during five periods of the class, was convicted of disseminating matter harmful to juveniles.

The Columbus Dispatch reported that the judge placed her on probation for three years but made the jail time a condition of probation.

Kearns said repeatedly that she was unaware of the movie's content and her attorney argued she would never would have knowingly showed it.

The teacher had told a detective she had her back to the screen and never turned around to watch the movie as it played for five separate classes throughout the day.

Schneider told Kearns 'there's no way you'll persuade me that's what happened.'

Meanwhile a student testified otherwise saying Kearns had watched the 129-minute movie. 

The student said the movie was 'disturbing' and said everyone in the class went 'crazy' while watching it.

An assistant principal who saw the DVD movie playing in the classroom confiscated it.

Prosecutors said the movie's title should have tipped off Kearns that she should check it out before showing it to her students, who ranged in age from 14 to 18.

Jurors watched the movie, which rates 4.7 out of 10 stars on the IMDb website, before convicting Kearns. 

After the conviction, the jury foreman said it wasn't proved at trial that Kearns was aware of the movie's content the first time she showed it but she would have known by the second, third, fourth and fifth showings. 

Kearns gave out a handwritten statement to reporters that praised God and included a Bible quote from Galatians: 'Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.' 

The school district fired Kearns in June 2013. The Ohio Department of Education permanently revoked her substitute-teaching license after her conviction.
