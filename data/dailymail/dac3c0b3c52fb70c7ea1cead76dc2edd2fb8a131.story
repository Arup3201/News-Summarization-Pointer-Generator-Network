Prime Minister Tony Abbott has described stopping the boats as the 'most compassionate' thing his government could have done.

Mr Abbott was trumpeting the success of Operations Sovereign Borders at the Liberal National Party state conference in Brisbane on Saturday when he made the comment, adding that secure borders were a sign of a sovereign nation.

Stopping the boats meant an end to budget blowouts, saving billions in unnecessary future spending and ending deaths, the prime minister said.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott described stopping the boats as the 'most compassionate' thing his government could have done at the Liberal National Party at the Annual Convention in Brisbane on Saturday

'That's why the most decent and most compassionate thing this government has done is to ensure that for more than six months now there has been no successful people smuggling venture to our country,' Mr Abbott told the conference.

'I am not declaring victory, but my friends we are stopping those boats.'

The prime ministers comments come less than a week after the High Court prevented the government from handing 153 asylum seekers back to the Sri Lankan authorities by granting an interim injunction.

The action was handed out after a number barristers brought the claim before the High Court, with solicitor George Newhouse in particular speaking out against the risks asylum seekers face when being returned to their home countries where they face possible persecution.

'The [immigration] minister cannot simply intercept their vessel in the middle of the night and "disappear them",' Mr Newhouse told AAP in relation to a boat of 41 asylum seekers who face criminal investigation after the Australian government returned them to Sri Lanka.

A member of the security team pushes an anti-government protester outside the convention a short time before Mr Abbott was scheduled to speak

'The asylum seekers claim that they are fleeing persecution and that they're at risk of death, torture or significant harm at the hands of Sri Lankan authorities,' Mr Newhouse said. '[There's] a need for ongoing protection.'

The prime minister also made no mention of the 'compassionate' state of detention centres, in which claims emerged last week about nine mothers on Christmas Island who attempted self harm in the hope their children would by allowed to stay in the country.

Also contrasting the prime ministers words, dozens of people gathered outside the conference to protest against Operation Sovereign Borders and started yelling, 'Shame, Bishop, shame' when they heard Foreign Minister Julie Bishop had arrived.

A member of the security team was also photographed pushing at one of the activists.

But Ms Bishop said they should be supporting the government's humanitarian efforts.

'There is nothing humanitarian about encouraging criminal people to pay criminal syndicates to get on unseaworthy boats and take a dangerous journey to Australia,' Ms Bishop said.

In contrast of the prime ministers words, a number of people attended the event to protest some of the government's policies, including its treatment of refugees

'They should have been protesting when 1200 people died at sea under the previous government's policies.

'That was a disaster and we don't intend to have that happen under our watch.'

Mr Abbott also admitted at the conference, that it had been an 'interesting week' in the Senate, after the Palmer United Party's last minute antics put the kibosh on the government's plans to repeal the carbon tax by Thursday.

But instead on focusing on PUP leader Clive Palmer's involvement, he pointed to Labor's reluctance to to rid Australia of the tax.

'Sure Mr Palmer has three senators, but Mr Shorten has 25,' Mr Abbott said.

'And we know that Mr Palmer will change his mind by Monday, but Bill Shorten will still be there come Monday, come Tuesday, come next week, come next month, come next year, supporting putting your power prices up. Smiling every time your power bill increases.'
