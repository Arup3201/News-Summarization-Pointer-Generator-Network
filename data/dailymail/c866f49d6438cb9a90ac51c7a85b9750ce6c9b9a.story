She is the Queen’s representative in Australia and is supposed to be impartial on political matters.

But Quentin Bryce has become the first Governor-General to declare support for the country becoming a republic.

In a speech, Mrs Bryce, 70, said that she hoped Australia will become a land where ‘one day, one young girl or boy may even grow up to be our nation’s first head of state’.

The comments by Brisbane-born Mrs Bryce 
have reignited impassioned debate about ties with Britain. They also 
come just months ahead of a visit by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

The
speech, in which she also backed gay marriage, was immediately seized 
upon by pro-republicans as a ‘historic declaration’. 

However, 
supporters of the monarchy criticised the comments, saying they were 
inappropriate for someone who represents the Queen.

Australian 
Monarchist League national chairman Philip Benwell said: ‘I think it’s 
disgraceful that a Governor-General, who must always be impartial on 
matters such as this, has come out in this manner.’

Australians for 
Constitutional Monarchy national convenor David Flint added: ‘It’s 
probably best for the Governor-General not to express a view on this. I 
don’t think it’s appropriate at all,’

But Geoff Gallop, head of the 
Australian Republican Movement, said: ‘The Governor-General has served 
with distinction as the Queen’s representative, but imagine what a 
powerful message it would send about this great country that we all love
if we had a head of state who represented the Australian people. We 
will always be friends with Britain, but now we should be equals.’

Mrs
Bryce, who retires next month after five years in the job, is a hugely 
respected figure in the country and is an outspoken advocate of women’s 
rights.

She outlined her vision for the future of Australia in a speech 
on national radio yesterday.

Ironically, Australian prime minister, 
Tony Abbott, is a staunch monarchist and in recent years – following 
successful Royal tours – the issue has largely fallen off the political 
radar. Although the role of Governor-General is largely ceremonial, he 
or she performs exactly the same constitutional role as the monarch does
in the United Kingdom.

Last night Buckingham Palace declined to 
comment on Mrs Bryce’s remarks, saying: ‘This is a matter for her, and 
Buckingham Palace will not comment further.’

However, a spokesman 
added: ‘In response to any questions about the future of the Monarchy in
Australia, Buckingham Palace has always maintained that this is a 
matter for the people of Australia.’
