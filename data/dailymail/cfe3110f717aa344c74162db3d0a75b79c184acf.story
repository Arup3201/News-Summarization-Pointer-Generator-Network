Arsenal need to sign Real Madrid's Sami Khedira in January if they want to win the Premier League this season, according to former midfielder Robert Pires.

Pires knows what it takes to win the title having won the Premier League twice during his time with the Gunners.

And the Frenchman – who has just signed for Goa FC in the newly formed Indian Super League – believes Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger needs a dominant midfielder.

Sami Khedira could be the ideal signing for Arsenal, according to former midfielder Robert Pires 

Khedira helped Germany win the World Cup in Brazil this summer 

Pires told The Daily Telegraph: ‘He [Wenger] needs a big player in the middle, like (Patrick) Vieira, strong, tall, because this position is very important for the balance between attack and defence.

‘The quality is there but you need more, maybe [someone] like Yaya Toure. He reminds me of Patrick Vieira, maybe they have an opportunity with Khedira.

‘It is likely in the January window. He played very well with Germany. My advice is if he can buy Khedira he can be the [new] Vieira, more aggression in the middle.

‘He has a lot of experience. When you play in the middle you need experience, especially when your midfield is young like Arsenal's.’

Khedira's contract at Madrid runs out next year and Arsenal could snap up the World Cup winner for around £10million in January.

Arsenal have not won the Premier League since 2003-04 when Pires was part of the side that went the whole season unbeaten.

Wenger’s side are currently eighth in the table after seven games and are nine points behind leaders Chelsea.
