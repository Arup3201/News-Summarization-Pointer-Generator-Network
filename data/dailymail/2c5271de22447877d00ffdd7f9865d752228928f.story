The threat of national service hanging over Chelsea winger Mohamed Salah's football career has been lifted - after the Egyptian Prime Minister personally cancelled his potential military call-up.

Salah's registration to an educational programme allowed him to avoid national service and stay in England was rescinded - leaving the 22-year-old facing the very real problem of having to return home for a period of 12 months to three years.

But the former Basel winger has now been given the all-clear to continue his career after high-ranking talks involving Egytian Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab, the football website www.kingfut.com said.

Mahlab held a meeting with Egypt's national coach Shawky Gharib and their Minister for Higher Education - and after announcing Salah's fate he reportedly said the decision could have been 'threatening' to Egyptian football, according to kingfut.com.

Neither Chelsea nor Salah received any official communications informing the player that he would have to return to Egypt although the club are believed to have spoken to their January signing about the issue.

The pacy winger has got off to a decent start in London since his £11million move from Basel in January, scoring in games against Arsenal and Stoke at Stamford Bridge.

He also scored the equaliser in Chelsea's 3-2 friendly win against AFC Wimbledon on Saturday.
