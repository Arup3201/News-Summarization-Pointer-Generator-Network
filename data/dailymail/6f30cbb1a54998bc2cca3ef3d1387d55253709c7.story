Liverpool's season lurched to a new low when they suffered a 1-0 defeat to Basle that threatens their prospects in the Champions League.

Already struggling to keep pace in the Barclays Premier League, Brendan Rodgers needs to find an immediate remedy for the problems that are ailing Liverpool to prevent a campaign that promised so much from completely unravelling.

Here, MailOnline Sport identifies five key areas where things are going wrong for Liverpool. 

THE SOFT CENTRE

Whichever way you present the figures, there is no easy reading. One clean sheet in nine games since the beginning of the campaign – or eight shut-outs in 31 matches in all competitions during 2014 – means Liverpool are too easy to score against.

Confidence in the back line is being shredded and Rodgers cannot find the right blend to make his team difficult to beat. He has not had a settled partnership in the middle of his defence since Jamie Carragher and Daniel Agger were working in tandem at the end of 2012-13.

It is imperative that Rodgers gives Liverpool steel at the back because, at the minute, every time the opposition get a corner or a free-kick, you expect a ball into the penalty area to lead to a goal. Nobody, from goalkeeper to central defenders, is prepared to take charge of the situation.

‘Too soft and easy to beat,’ were the withering appraisals of Rodgers and Steven Gerrard as they trudged out of St Jakob Park. Nobody was inclined to disagree with them

THE LACK OF PUNCH

If the goals-against column is giving Rodgers headaches, so, too, will be the amount his team are scoring. Bar one dazzling performance at White Hart Lane, when they cut Tottenham to ribbons, the verve and dash of last season has been absent.

Without Luis Suarez – more on him later – and the injured Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool do not have the pace to get in behind teams and the experiment of making Mario Balotelli the spearhead of this unit is not working. He slows the team down and gives no intensity.

Liverpool never looked like getting Basle on the turn, bar one moment when Adam Lallana set Raheem Sterling free, but the same has been true for the last month; they created next to nothing against Aston Villa, Ludogorets and their play was often charmless against Middlesbrough.

THE OVER RELIANCE ON KEY PLAYERS

An outlay of more than £100million this summer should have been a sign for the creative responsibility to be shared between the squad but, so far, the same players are being asked to come up with results to save the team.

Take Sterling. Rodgers does not want to expose the 19-year-old to burnout but his quality means he has played 764 of the 840 minutes of Liverpool’s season so far. Next in the list are Gerrard and Jordan Henderson (720 minutes).

There is more to it than that, however. Sterling is also Liverpool’s chief creator of chances and their join-leading scorer with Gerrard. Rodgers needs other players to step forward to help the ease burden on two men at the opposite end of the age spectrum.

INJURIES

In fairness to Rodgers, he has been left without his main striker for a month through no fault of his own. Sturridge would almost certainly have had an impact on results during September, given his ratio for scoring goals, while Joe Allen’s energy and tenacity have been missed.

‘It has been frustrating at times but, day by day, we will be looking to get better,’ said Rodgers. ‘Joe Allen never gets mentioned, and other guys like Emre Can and Glen Johnson returning will makes us a much stronger squad. But we are nowhere near technically where we were last season.’

NO X-FACTOR

There is no point wasting energy mourning the fact Suarez is no longer at Anfield but it is impossible not to see that Liverpool are now easy to play against without him.

When Suarez was leading the line, Liverpool had intensity. He scrambled the minds of defenders, created space for other to cause havoc and his presence in the team dragged his colleagues up another level.

In his place, Balotelli has done nothing so far to show why he has been afforded such adulation by his new supporters. He arrived with a big reputation - not all of it good, by any means - but it has been hard to see why there has been such noise around him.

Liverpool began this campaign aiming to build on the 84 points they collected last year and they needed a special talent to come and take over from Suarez. What they did not require was someone who only wants to turn it on when it suits.

Somehow Rodgers has to unlock Balotelli's ability - and resolve the issues that are threatening to dash their dreams.
