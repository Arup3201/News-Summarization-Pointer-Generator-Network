A cop who set up a hidden camera to video the town police chief having sex in a public ambulance lost his job on Friday, while his boss kept his.

New Mexico officer Joshua Terrell tried to catch Jal police chief Larry Burns having sex inside and up against an ambulance on city property because he wanted to sabotage his run for magistrate.

Despite catching Burns on camera with a woman while wearing his gun and badge, the dastardly plan came back to haunt Terrell after he gave the footage to local television instead of Jal city manager, Bob Gallagher.

Reprieved: Larry Burns (pictured) kept his job despite being caught having sex in a town ambulance while  Joshua Terrell lost his job

Initially, Burns was suspended for two weeks without pay while an investigation was launched.

That discovered that Terrell planted the camera and led to his dismisal for violating eight different policies including using a key to access the ambulance bay when he was not authorized to be there.

And, because he did not keep the video evidence internal, he is not protected from the sack as a whistleblower, because he released it to the public.

'To try to destroy a person that he did not like – I thought we didn't need Terrell with a badge or a gun,' Mr Gallagher said to KRQE.

'It would have been very easy if he had just come in with the tape and said, 'Mr Gallagher, I think something is going wrong in the department'.'

Gallagher said that Burns did make an error of judgement, but that no evidence could be found that he committed a crime or was even on duty when the tape was filmed.

The police chief, Larry Burns, also serves as the town of Jal’s Emergency Medical Services Director.

'In this case there was no criminal activity whatsoever, there was no proof whatsoever that it was on duty when he should have been working, ' said Gallagher according to Opposing Views.

'I think it was lapse of judgment. Something that I don’t think will keep him from being able to perform his duties when he comes back.'
