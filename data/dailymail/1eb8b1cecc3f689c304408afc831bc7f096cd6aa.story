Last week, a Delaware cop gained a certain notoriety with a sassy rendition of Taylor Swift's 'Shake it Off' recorded on the dash-cam of his patrol car, and now, he's back.

On Monday night, the 19-year police veteran performed the song on a larger stage, at the annual Dancing With The Delaware Stars, an event benefiting single parents in the area, according to ABC News .

In the three-minute performance, Davis is seen wearing a black suit with a fuchsia dress shirt. First, the officer lip-syncs the song and dances in a chair as women wearing handcuffs dance around him.

Soon, Davis gets up from the chair and many of the benefit's guests join him in a the three-minute choreographed dance.
