A 45-year-old man has died after attempting to 'surf' on top of a New York City subway car while allegedly high on synthetic marijuana.

The 'subway surfer' smashed his head on a beam overhead as the train pulled into the station on Wednesday afternoon, witnesses say.

He saw the overhead metal bar coming and tried to climb down from the top of the car, but could not move in time.

The man hat climbed on top of a 6 train in Manhattan, New York. He died when an overhead beam bashed him in the head

He fell off and tumbled in between the train cars, though it does not appear he was run over.

Pablo Reyes told DNA Info that he was a friend of the dead man and that they stayed in the same homeless shelter.

Mr Reyes said the man, called 'Grump,' had just smoked synthetic marijuana, also called K2, when he decided to climb out of the train car and on top of it.

'He was hanging out getting high. I told him, "Stop getting high off that s***. It ainâ€™t no good for you." He probably was hallucinating,' Mr Reyes told the New York Daily News.

The man climbed atop the downtown 6-train as it was running between East 125th Street and East 96th Street along Lexington Avenue on Wednesday afternoon.

Officials said that the new trend of 'train surfing' was 'simply one of the dumbest things you could do'

Mr Reyes said he spread his arms out as he stood atop the train.

As the train pulled into the 96th Street Station - with the 45-year-old 'surfer' still on top - the man hit his head.

'I'm in shock. I've never seen anything like that. There was too much blood,' Mr Reyes said of his friend.

He was taken to the hospital, where he died less than an hour later.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Transit Authority told DNA Info that the the new trend of 'subway surfing' is 'simply one of the dumbest things you can do.'
