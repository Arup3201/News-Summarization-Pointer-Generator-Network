Public school pupils clashed with police after trashing a £2million house during an end-of-term party.

Officers spent two hours trying to disperse the teenagers, who are said to have caused £15,000 of damage to the property.

Sixth-formers from the £9,000-a-term Mill Hill school in north-west London had reportedly rented the house, in one of Britain’s wealthiest areas, to hold ‘a not-too-large party’.

The Sixth-form students were reportedly from the £9,000-a-term Mill Hill School (pictured)

But as more and more guests arrived, the celebration spilled out of control – and into the streets.

A resident who lives near the property
in Hampstead, north-west London, said: ‘It looked like there was a riot
going on outside. It was horrible.’

The 31-year-old householder described being woken by loud noises at around 1am.

‘You could hear the police trying to 
make them go home but they wouldn’t listen,’ she said. ‘Some of them got
into the faces of the police and were being quite aggressive. The 
police then called for back-up and more cars turned up. I’d say there 
were around 20 in total.

‘They cordoned the road off. Then you 
could hear the teenagers smashing car windows along the street. It all 
escalated really quickly.

‘It really kicked off when the police 
started to make arrests. They did a really great job in sorting it out 
quickly.’ A 61-year-old artist who also lives near the house said: 
‘Apart from the school run when it can get quite noisy, it is normally 
quite quiet.

‘It is a very, very, very rich area and this kind of thing just doesn’t happen around here.

Big bill: The owner of the property, pictured said she rented the house to the students believing it was for a small sleepover but claims they've caused up to £15,000 worth of damage

‘This is a very genteel area, the 
people are rich beyond your imagination. Stuff like this doesn’t happen 
here.’ He said of the party: ‘There was lots of screaming and shouting. 
The amount of police cars was unbelievable – there must have been 20 
vehicles.

‘There were more cops than there were people at one point. It was young people, and you could hear music and shouting.

‘One tall guy, he came running out and I believe he was then arrested. I believe he was the instigator.

‘There were a lot of cops saying “don’t worry about that, everything is under control, go back inside and keep away”.’

Another neighbour, Chris Fallows, 49, 
said: ‘There were about 40 or 50 kids, all well-dressed, and they were 
yelling right in the cops’ faces.

‘They were inches away from them, shouting, cursing and refusing to move. This went on until about 2am.

‘A lot of the kids had their mobiles 
out and they were thrusting them in the faces of the policemen, almost 
daring them to do something.’

Rich: It took police two hours to disperse the crowds from Arkwright Road, pictured, in Hampstead, which neighbours described as incredibly wealthy

It is believed that two boys from Mill Hill organised the party, which took place on a Thursday night last month.

A 17-year-old has been charged with a public order offence.

A 16-year-old and 17-year-old have been bailed pending further inquiries.

Chief inspector Steve Wright, who 
leads local neighbourhood policing teams, said: ‘Police were called to a
disturbance on June 6 at approximately 00.55 hours and officers made 
three arrests.

‘Enquiries are ongoing and the investigation continues.

‘One person has already been charged 
with a public order offence and it would be inappropriate to comment 
further at this stage.’

A Metropolitan Police spokesman added:
‘One teenager has been charged with a section five public order offence
for causing harassment, alarm or distress.

‘Another was arrested for assaulting a
police officer, and another under section four for using threatening 
behaviour. Both have been bailed.’
