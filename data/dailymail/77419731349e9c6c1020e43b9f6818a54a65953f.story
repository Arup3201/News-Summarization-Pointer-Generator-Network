The most senior EU official could be declared unfit for his post next week by European MPs over his alleged role in tax avoidance.

Jean-Claude Juncker, the arch-federalist president of the European Commission, faces a censure motion because of his alleged role in turning Luxembourg into Europe’s biggest tax haven when he was Prime Minister of the country.

Far-right and anti-EU MEPs have managed to collect enough support for a motion of censure, which must be debated and voted on, possibly as soon as next week.

Italian comedian-turned politician Beppe Grillo, right, is behind the attempt to censure Jean-Claude Junker over his alleged role in turning Luxembourg into one of Europe's biggest tax havens

The Five Star movement of Italian former stand-up comedian Beppe Grillo is behind the attempt to declare Juncker ‘intolerable’, claiming he has lost his credibility as president of the European Commission.

The plan also has the support of Nigel Farage’s Ukip.

But a lack of support for the censure motion from other parties, less than a month after the European Parliament endorsed the appointment of Juncker’s 28-strong executive team, makes it highly improbable that his critics will win the two-thirds majority required to force the Commission from office.

The European Parliament has no power to sanction individual members of the executive. An alliance of Eurosceptics, including Ukip and the French National Front gathered 76 signatures to meet the threshold of 10 percent of the 751-seat chamber to put the motion on the agenda.

It stated that Mr Juncker, who was Luxembourg’s Prime Minister for two decades until a year ago, was directly responsible for tax policies which are now under investigation by the Commission for unfairly attracting multinational businesses.

Eurozone countries have had to slash spending and hike taxes to counter government debt crises in the past few years, heightening public resentment of schemes that help wealthy individuals and companies to pay less tax.

Jean-Claude Junker, left, was Luxembourg's prime minister for two decades and was responsible for the country's controversial tax policies which are currently under investigation by the European Commission 

‘It is intolerable that a person who has been responsible for aggressive tax avoidance policies serves as president of the European Commission,’ the motion read.

Mr Juncker has said he wants a level playing field in corporate taxation. The censure motion, brought by parties that oppose EU oversight over states, said ‘tax sovereignty’ was vital for competition but Luxembourg’s policies were not fair competition.

Eurosceptics won a bigger voice in parliament at elections in May amid growing disillusionment with economic austerity and perceived failures of European Union administration.

They have complained of a ‘grand coalition’ of mainstream parties backing Mr Juncker and trying to suppress minority views in parliament.
