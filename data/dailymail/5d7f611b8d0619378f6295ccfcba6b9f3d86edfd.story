Controversial CNN anchor Don Lemon has raised more eyebrows after inviting a member of the Ku Klux Klan to speak on his show about alleged racist chants by a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma. 

The news host interviewed James Moore, also known as Imperial Kludd of the Loyal White Knights, on his programme about race relations in America.

The interview was conducted via Skype, with Moore in traditional KKK dress and sunglasses. 

CNN anchor Don Lemon interviewed a James Moore, also known as Imperial Kludd of the Loyal White Knights about race relations 

It came as Mr Lemon attempted to talk to the KKK member about the controversy surrounding racist chanting by a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma and ongoing tension in Ferguson, Missouri.

The exchange started with Moore claiming there were double standards when it came to race relations in unversities saying he had the right to freedom of association.

The KKK member said: 'We have a right to associate with whoever we want.

'Is it a crime to have all white fraternities like there are all black fraternities?'

However, when asked by Mr Lemon why he joined the KKK, he then attacked the news anchor, saying: 'By people like yourself who said I couldn't stand up for my people.'

The interview saw people criticise CNN and Mr Lemon on Twitter for giving a plaftform to an organisation with such views.

It is not the first time Mr Lemon has stoked controversy with his interviews on CNN. 

In November, he was forced to apologise after pressing an alleged rape victim of Bill Cosby on why she didn't use her teeth to avoid performing oral sex on the comedian.

Mr Lemon said he had never intended to offend during his interview with Cosby rape accuser Joan Tarshis, adding that he too was a victim of sexual assault.

The presenter said: 'As a victim myself I would never want to suggest that any victim could have prevented a rape.

'If my question struck anyone as insensitive, I’m sorry as that was not my intention.'

Meanwhile in August, rapper Talib Kweli stormed off an interview with the host live on air after he criticized the media's coverage of events - including Lemon's own network CNN- - of the shooting of black teenager Michael Brown.

The two ended up bickering over the coverage before the rapper walked away from the interview.
