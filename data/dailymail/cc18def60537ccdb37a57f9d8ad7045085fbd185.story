A wintry storm pushing through the western half of the country is bringing bitterly cold temperatures that prompted safety warnings for residents in the Rockies and threatened crops as far south as California.

The jet stream is much farther south than normal, allowing the cold air to push in from the Arctic and drop temperatures by 20 to 40 degrees below normal levels, AccuWeather meteorologist Tom Kines said on Tuesday.

Areas of Montana and the Dakotas were forecast to reach lows in the minus-20s, while parts of California could see the thermometer drop to the 20s.

The icy, 'Polar Express' blast was expected to be followed by another one later in the week, creating an extended period of cold weather that hasn't been seen since the late 1990s, meteorologists said.

Officials warned residents to protect themselves against frostbite if they are going to be outside for any length of time.

'When it gets this cold, you don't need 30, 40 mile-per-hour winds to get that wind chill down to dangerous levels. All it takes is a little breeze,' Kines said.Â

The storm hit the northern Rockies on Monday and Tuesday, dumping up to 2 feet of snow in the mountains and in Yellowstone National Park.

Snow and ice created hazardous driving conditions throughout the West, and were a factor in a four-vehicle crash in central Montana that killed 21-year-old Chelsea Stanfield of Great Falls. Authorities said Stanfield was driving too fast for the conditions.

The weather also closed a stretch of Interstate 90 on Tuesday between Sheridan and Buffalo, Wyoming.

In the Dakotas, cattle ranchers who 
lost thousands of animals in an October blizzard were bracing for the 
latest wintry weather, with wind chills of 40 degrees below zero 
expected by week's end.

Cattle
should be able to withstand the harsh conditions better than they did 
the October 4 blizzard, said Julie Ellingson, executive vice president 
of the North Dakota Stockmen's Association.

'Cattle are a hardy species; they can 
endure a lot,' she said. 'With that October storm, they didn't have 
their winter hair coat yet. They've acquired some of that extra hair 
that will help insulate them better.'

The
cold was expected to keep pushing south and bring near-record low 
temperatures to parts of California.

Citrus farmers in the Central 
Valley checked wind machines and ran water through their fields in 
anticipation of temperatures at or below freezing Tuesday night, 
followed by even colder weather on Saturday.

However, farmers should not panic, said Bob Blakely of California Citrus Mutual, a trade association. Cold weather can be good for the crops, he said.

'Trees and fruits need some of that cold weather to harden off and prepare for late December and January,' he said.

The system was pushing south, and Texans enjoying balmy 80-degree days should be seeing temperatures in the 40s by Thursday, Kines said.

The cold air is expected to linger until next week then move east, where it will bring less-drastic temperature changes, he said.
