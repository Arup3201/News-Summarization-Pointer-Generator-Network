Cadigan-Lettre then exited the room, spritzed her husband with hairspray and used an electronic control device on him while pounding him with a hammer, according to WTSP.

Lettre retreated down the hall to get away, but his wife tackled him in the entrance to the living room and then stabbed him with a knife and a screwdriver.  

Pinellas County deputies, notified by neighbors to a commotion, arrived to find the two struggling with each other and separated them. 

Lettre and his wife were both taken to a local hospital in Clearwater, Florida, for treatment for non-life-threatening injuries. Cadigan-Lettre was then arrested.
