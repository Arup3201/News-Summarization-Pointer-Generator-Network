A restaurant owned by Lady Gaga's parents has been panned by a top critic who branded the food 'unspeakably fatty' and the waiters 'clueless'.

Italian eatery 'Joanne Trattoria' was savaged by the New York Post's Steve Cuozzo for serving up 'calamari like leather' and 'shellfish pasta similar to airplane food'.

The press had been banned from the opening but the savage critic managed to get a place inside the restaurant.

The famously caustic Cuozzo tore into the menu, claiming that some of the food was, 'the worst I've had in a lifetime'.

Crowds gather outside Joanne Trattoria in Manhattan on Wednesday, during its grand opening. The restaurant was panned by top critic Steve Cuozzo

In an article entitled 'You'll Gag on the Food at Gaga's', Cuozzo slammed the waiters and the dishes.

'You don't expect a brand-new eatery to be running on all cylinders,' he wrote. 'But Joanne, owned by the pop superstar's parents, last night was running mainly on acrid-smelling burnt vinegar wafting intermittently through the raucous dining room.'

Cuozzo complained about the the 'unspeakably fatty veal osso bucco,' which he said was overpriced at $38 (£24), and he criticised the appetizers that took 50 minutes to arrive.

Despite boasting the highly rated TV 
chef Art Smith as it food chief, the Big Apple tabloid goes on to 
describe the service as 'plucked from the 'burbs' and 'clueless'.

The 25-year old singer's parents Joseph and Cynthia Germanotta will be hoping the review doesn't have a negative effect on bookings. 

Named after Gaga's aunt, Joanne, who died of lupus aged 19, the Grammy award winning pop star has often said the late painter was an inspiration to her.

With traditional New York home-style wooden furnishings which the New York Post found to be 'plain cramped' and 'loud as an avalanche', the restaurant is a far cry from Lady Gaga's crazy style.

And during last nights ill fated service it seemed that Lady Gaga's father Joseph himself was walking around the front of house.

This is the first time that he and his wife have dabbled in the restaurant business and Joseph, a former internet entrepreneur, is excited by the prospect.

'This has been a lifelong dream, and I couldn't be happier that it's finally happening,' he told New York's Daily News yesterday.

The Italian menu features recipes not just from Lady Gaga, but also Joseph and Gaga's grandmother.

Meals
at 'Joanne' include include Wood Fired Focaccia, Zucchini Fritters, 
Tomato Fennel Soup, Chopped Antipasti Salad, Papa Joe's Chicken, Grandma
Ronnie's Meatballs and Six Layer Lasagna.

The
menu was designed by Mr  Smith, who famously worked for talk show queen
Oprah Winfrey in 2007. He cooked for Gaga on the Oprah Show some years 
back.

'This is truly a collaborative effort, inspired by the Germanotta's family love of food and family,' Joseph told the Daily News.

'Everything from the menu to the decor has a bit of their family in it. It's why everything is so warm and approachable.'

The decor inside the establishment is the complete polar opposite to the singer's eccentric style.

The eatery features wooden tables, leather booths, open brick walls, and warm-coloured painted walls.

Portraits and photographs of the Germanotta family are dotted throughout, and guests can enjoy an open fireplace in the outside courtyard.

Meanwhile, the Poker Face cinger has revealed she wants a child but in her usual style has divulged a series of demands, including the father must be Italian and conception would be through artificial insemination.

Gaga is notoriously private about her love life, but earlier this week she told Spain's Radio Ibiza she was looking for a partner to have a child with, but they must share her Italian and Sicilian roots.

She said: 'I want a baby from an Italian - possibly Sicilian - donor.'

Lady Gaga's father Joseph originally comes from the village of Naso in Sicily.
