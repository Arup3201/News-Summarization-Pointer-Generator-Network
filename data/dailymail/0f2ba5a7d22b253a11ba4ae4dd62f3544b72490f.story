The world's most bling egg has been unveiled in time for Easter - but you'll need to be a billionaire to shell out for this extravagant one-off.

A cross between a Faberge egg and the Damien Hirst skull, the 'Mirage' is a unique gem that only the richest can afford.

The incredible ornament has more than 1,000 diamonds on the outside 'shell' - worth £1.5million alone - 100 of which are a unique cut.

18-carat gold

Unveiled in time for Easter, you would need to be a persuasive billionaire if you want to buy this expensive one-off

And the diamond-covered egg opens up to reveal an ornate globe, hand-crafted in 18-carat gold.

The globe's top shell raises to reveal a delicate rock crystal dove, perched on a gold olive branch.

The dove and olive branch were hand carved in gold and were included as symbols of world peace.

Mirage has taken three years to make, with work carried out by the world's elite craftsmen across three continents.

Manfred Wild is the main man in charge of Mirage's design and assembly. And with millions spent in labour costs alone, that's a heavy responsibility.

Vashi Dominguez, jeweller to the stars, has access to the private owner of this masterpiece, a mystery collector.

It was not going to be sold, but Mr Dominguez claims he is working on persuading the anonymous owner to place it on the market.

At £5 million, Mirage would cost the same price as a posh London home, though at present the owner has no plans to sell it

The egg's private owner had no intention of selling but Mr Dominguez believes if anyone did make an offer in the 'multiple millions' they might be able to strike a deal.

Diamond specialist Dominguez thinks Mirage is one of the most valuable jewels ever created.

He said: 'Mirage is, quite simply, one of the finest jewels ever created.

'The owner has said he has no intention of selling the wondrous piece, but if someone really wants it I can see if we can come to an agreement.

'The diamonds alone are worth more than £1.5 million while labour costs were around the same.'

At £5 million, Mirage would cost the same price as a very smart London home or 30 times the price of a Ferrari 458 Italia supercar.

Unveiled just in time for Easter, the Mirage is believed to be one of the most expensive jewels ever made

Every centimeter of the egg and the stand is covered in diamonds and beautifully constructed

If the average Briton saved their entire post-tax salary, it would take them 243 years before they could afford Mirage.

However, Mr Dominguez believes the owner would end up wanting more.

He added: 'The owner doesn't need to sell Mirage, but it is all about one-upmanship in the world of the billionaire and money does talk.

'Owning this special item would be a great coup for someone for whom money is no object.'
