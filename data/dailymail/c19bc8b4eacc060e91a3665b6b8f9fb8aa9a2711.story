Vladimir Putin was threatened with fresh sanctions yesterday if he did not rein in pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine.

The warning came a day after a Ukrainian military helicopter was shot down, killing nine.

Rebels are also said to have broken a ceasefire 44 times since it began on Friday.

Foreign Secretary William Hague and German chancellor Angela Merkel urged the Russian president to speed up his efforts to stabilise the situation following two months of fighting in which at least 420 people have been killed.

Mrs Merkel welcomed the surprise decision by Mr Putin to cancel a parliamentary resolution granted in spring authorising him to use Russian forces in Ukraine.

The
 US and EU have already imposed sanctions twice, freezing assets and 
banning travel for Mr Putin’s inner circle after Russia annexed Crimea.

Further sanctions are likely to penalise entire sectors of the Russian economy and be far more damaging.

Mr Hague said the downing of the helicopter was hard to reconcile with Mr Putin’s claims to favour peace.

He added: ‘We urge Russia to take the necessary actions to stop the flow of arms across the border, to stop supporting illegally-armed separatist groups in eastern Ukraine, because in absence of actions by Russia the case for stronger sanctions from EU nations will become stronger.’

President Putin wants Ukraine to extend the truce and hold talks with the rebels, while Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has promised to submit constitutional amendments offering broader powers to predominately rebel areas in the east.
