Normally, they are to be found pulling Santa’s sleigh over roof-tops to the delight of countless children. But this festive season, reindeer can be found in a much more mundane location — stacked in packs in the deli aisle of a budget High Street supermarket.

For Lidl, whose dramatic price-discounting has lured shoppers away from its rivals, is selling smoked reindeer meat this year among its Christmas delicacies. The packs are part of the German-owned chain’s ‘Deluxe’ range.

But are we British — brought up on stories of Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer — too sentimental to want a slice of Dasher, Dancer or Prancer with our Christmas lunch? And in any case, what does it taste like?

According to Lidl bosses, ‘reindeer resembles antelope in flavour and texture.’ But since most Britons will never have tasted antelope, this isn’t the most useful recommendation.

So I decided to test it for myself and found some of this ‘tender and flavoursome’ Scandinavian delicacy sitting in the chiller cabinet in Lidl’s store in Wood Green, North London, alongside other cured meats.

It comes from a company in Finland, with the meat originally from Russia. The animals are not kept in farms but are herded in the wild. Not surprisingly, the company that produces the meat has been accused by animal welfare groups of delivering ‘sick novelty for profit’ and making a mockery of the festive season.

Justin Kerswell, of the animal welfare and vegetarian group Viva!, is also concerned that wild predators of reindeer, such as wolves and bears, are shot to protect supplies for retailers.

He says: ‘What Lidl aren’t telling their customers is that to put reindeer meat on British shelves, other large wild animals are systematically hunted or trapped and shot.’

Lidl denies this claim.

A spokesman says the animals are slaughtered under EU guidelines and meet the firm’s ‘high standards of food safety, hygiene and animal welfare’.

She adds: ‘The smoked reindeer that we sell is from the Yamalo-Nenets autonomous region in Siberia. The reindeers pasture freely in the tundra year around, changing location on almost a weekly basis.’

In that area of Siberia, reindeer are vital to the livelihoods of tens of thousands of indigenous herders in Russia’s ‘High Latitudes’, where temperatures can drop to minus 50c.

The animals are used for meat, for skins to make clothes and tents, and to tow sledges.

According to the Russians, reindeer meat is ‘ecologically clean’.

Certainly, it is exceptionally lean — comparing favourably with fish for its high levels of health-boosting chemicals, such as omega-3 fatty acids, which protect against breast cancer and heart disease. Im a paper published last year, Ammar Eltayeb Ali Hassan, of the Arctic University of Norway said: ‘Reindeer meat is very healthy.

‘It contains more than double the values of some nutrients as other meats, and is comparable to chicken in fat. Reindeer meat also has more than twice as much vitamin B12 [which helps prevent anaemia] as veal or lamb.’

One of the reasons for its nutritious value is the animal’s diet, which, in the winter, is comprised mainly of lichens (which are rich in selenium, zinc and iron).

But reindeer meat is hardly known in the UK — and when Gordon Ramsay offered a recipe for reindeer stew on his TV series, Gordon Ramsay’s F Word, there was a strong reaction from viewers.

So what will consumers make of Lidl’s carpaccio-style 100g packs of Deluxe Smoked Cured Reindeer Steak?

The slices of meat are dark maroon in colour and smell overpoweringly smoky. My husband pronounced them ‘delicious’, but couldn’t resist asking: ‘Is this Donner, Blitzen, Prancer or Vixen?’

He said the steaks smelled ‘lovely, quite delicate . . . Like Italian salami, very smoky. A taste sensation, very salty. It’s less gamey tasting than venison. I definitely like it.’

However, food writer Rose Prince, who has a more professional palate, disagrees.

She agrees that reindeer meat, which is essentially venison, is a lean and healthy option, but says these cured slices have ‘a horrible strong flavour — salty and artificially smoky’.

She also points out that they are made from ‘reformed meat’, meaning they have been chopped to a mush then shaped into a salami.

When she tried them, she says: ‘They were sweaty when they came out of the pack, then began to dry out quickly.’

She concludes: ‘It is a very nasty product and a waste of good meat. I don’t think reindeer meat slices will find much of a market in Britain, not just because of the emotional reaction to them, but also because they taste disgusting.’

William Sitwell, MasterChef judge and editor of Waitrose Kitchen magazine, is not a fan either.

‘I like eating venison. I think it’s important to eat free-range game — a mostly happy life, a lean meat — so good for the tummy and soul,’ he says.

But he says the cured cuts ‘look awful’.

‘Why turn a wild product into something that looks cheaper than processed ham — the little roundels just cheapen its identity.

‘It’s shiny and gelatinous, which is not pleasant on the eye.’

HE ADDS: ‘Then there is the flavour. Any merit the meat might have had is overwhelmed by too much smoke and too much salt.

‘The only way to eat this would be buried in a bun with lashings of pickle and salad. It’s a shame, an opportunity missed to encourage people to eat more natural food.’

Reindeer are strong runners and are the most

energy efficient of all land animals

For its part, Lidl says its reindeer meat is selling well — particularly in the South-East.

Perhaps the last word should go to one of the chain’s checkout girls. As she packs my shopping, she says: ‘I’ve eaten venison. It’s very tasty.’

I ask her if she has tried the reindeer. She wrinkles her nose.

‘Not the reindeer,’ she says. ‘I think eating Rudolph would be a step too far for me.’
