The legalization of marijuana for recreational use in Colorado and Washington state has got local wedding planners gearing up for an influx of couples looking to spice up their nuptials with a weed-themed wedding.

The idea might sound ludicrous, but organizers are predicting that marijuana and marriages may very soon become a winning combination.

‘It’s the new wine. I think Colorado will see a lot more destination weddings for this reason,’ Jane West who runs Edible Events Co., a Denver-based company specializing in private BYOC (bring your own cannabis) events.

‘We’re going to start thinking of cannabis like alcohol, and we’re moving towards regulating cannabis like alcohol and normalizing its consumption,’ she told The Knot.

While she hasn’t had any bookings for marijuana marriages so far, she is working with some brides-to-be who want to incorporate weed into their bachelorette parties and bridal showers.

After attending a traditional Las Vegas bachelorette party, Jennifer Gargotto said she decided she ‘didn’t want a traditional bridal shower’.

A cannabis advocate, who runs Cannibase an online marketplace for cannabis along with her fiancé, she decided weed would be the prefect way for her guests to relax and get to know each other before her big day.

‘It’s a chance to demonstrate how classy it can be and hopefully calm some nerves and help people get to know each other before the wedding,’ she said.

Another bride to-be with ties to Colorado’s burgeoning weed-related industry in Christianna Lewis, who works for The Hemp Connoissuer magazine.

She told The Knot that she and her fiancé initially wanted cannabis to be a part of their wedding, but found it wasn’t currently that easy.

‘Initially my fiance wanted to have an area for vaporizing, but because of the venue we chose it won’t be at the actual wedding,’ said Christianna.

Both brides-to-do also spoke about not wishing to make guests who aren't cannabis uses feel uncomfortable and so neither is currently planning to serve marijuana at their weddings.

'We’re trying to be mindful and respectful of their feelings, even though they’re supportive of what we both do,' said Christianna.

Instead, she and her finance have decided to throw a joint (pardon the pun) bridal shower with a variety of weed sweets and edibles involved.

With smoking outlawed in many venues, marijuana-infused drinks and snacks may well be the best way for people to ingest their now legal high in the future.

Colorado's first retail marijuana stores opened Jan. 1 for sale to people 21 years and older.

Under federal law, marijuana is still an illegal drug. However, the Justice Department is not challenging state marijuana laws as long as they don't conflict with eight federal enforcement priorities.
