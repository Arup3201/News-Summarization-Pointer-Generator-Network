A man has told how he survived after getting sucked into wood chipper.

Frank Arce was attempting to dislodge some wood when the machine suddenly started up.

Metal spikes and claws that can shred a tree branch in seconds began pummeling his body.

He suffered seven broken ribs, a toe, his ankle and his pelvis.

Lucky to be alive: Frank Arce, 23, is recovering after he fell THROUGH a wood chipper this week. He was badly injured but escaped with his life

The chipper broke Mr Arce's ankle and toe - as well as cracking his ribs and pelvis

The 23-year-old also suffered an open fracture to his knee, numerous cuts and a collapsed lung.

He is recovering at Peace Health Southwest Medical Center in Vancouver, Washington, where he has undergone multiple surgeries since the accident.

Speaking about the accident he told KATU-TV: 'Basically I was praying for the best and preparing for the worst.

'In a situation like that, that's honestly all you could do.'

Mr Arce added: 'Actually going through the machine itself wasn't the worst part about it.

'What was the worst part (was) the not knowing what was going to happen.'

Mr Arce was conscious the entire time he was sucked into the machine and pushed out on to a conveyor belt.

He was working at the Swanson Bark and Wood Products company when the bark-stripping machine jammed.

Colleagues switched off the power as Mr Arce reached into the wood chipper.

He said he was satisfied all safety procedures had been followed and was confident the machine was off.

But health and safety investigators found the machine known as a porcupine was still switched on and started up pulling him inside.

The porcupine consists of six to seven-inch-long tines, which are curved that spin on shaft to break apart and fluff-up bark.

Mr Arce said the equipment left gashes in his hard hat.

He believes his slim frame also helped him survive.

Mr Arce landed on a conveyor belt about six feet below where he had been standing.

Coworkers shut down the machinery when they heard him scream. They applied compresses and kept Mr Arce calm and conscious while he waited for paramedics.

'They kept their cool enough to keep me calm,' Mr Arce said.

Frank Arce's ordeal is reminiscent of THAT gruesome scene from the 1996 Coen Brothers film 'Fargo' - though Mr Arce was far more fortunate

'Everything happened so fast. It's hard to put it in words. They handled it in the best way they possibly could, which I'm eternally grateful for.

'There was a thought (that I was going to die) but it was more like something was telling me I wasn't going to die that day,' he said.

'I felt I had a lot of angels out there with me that day a lot of people looking out for me.'

Keeping him calm help keep his heart rate down and slowed his blood loss, he said.

Paramedics took Mr Arce to St. John Medical, where he was stabilized and sent to PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center in Vancouver.

Mr Arce said doctors expect he'll remain hospitalized for at least three weeks, but heÂ  is bracing for a 'lengthy' recovery process.

'It's a long road ahead of him,' his mother, Brenda Arce.

'He could face some permanent nerve damage.'

The state Bureau of Labor and Industries is investigating the accident.
