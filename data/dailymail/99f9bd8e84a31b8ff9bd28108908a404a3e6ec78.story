A young Syrian boy has been hailed a hero after a video showing him running through sniper fire to save a girl emerged online.

The one-minute clip shows the boy running from the left side of the frame and coming under fire as he dashes towards a car-wreck.

As he runs shots are fired at him and he appears to fake being shot in the chest and falling over.

Stopped: More shots are fired as he runs and it looks like the young boy has been hit in the chest

Second of fear: The boy falls to the ground, and for a short moment, the men filming thinks he has been killed

A second later he gets up and disappears behind the car before emerging hand in hand with the terrified girl who has been hiding from fire.

He appears to struggle to convince her to run to safety, but the girl, dressed in pink, eventually runs with him as more shots are fired. 

The video has not been independently verified, but it is believed to be from Yabroud, a countryside town 50 miles from Damascus. 

Survivor: Seconds later, the boy gets up again, having fooled the snipers, and runs towards the car

Hero: The boy emerges from behind the car, holding the hands of a girl who has been hiding in fear

Bravery: The pair are being fired at, but the heroic boy convinces the girl to run

Success: The two children run out of sight, and appears to have made it across 

Yabroud was the last rebel stronghold held by the FSA on the Lebanese border before it fell to Assad's forces in March 2014 

The video, which was uploaded yesterday, has already had nearly 500,000 views.

It was later re-published on YouTube by Sham News Network, which is run by activists based in Damascus. 

Several YouTube comments claim the video is fake, but experts told The Telegraph they have no reason to doubt its authenticity.
