Russia's government has pushed the country into an economic crisis by not tackling its financial problems fast enough, former finance minister Alexei Kudrin has said

Russia's government has pushed the country into an economic crisis by not tackling its financial problems fast enough, former finance minister Alexei Kudrin has said. 

His comments came as the central bank bailed out its first victim of the collapsing currency and authorities announced a tax on grain exports to protect domestic stocks. A poll of 11 economists also predicted that Russia's gross domestic product would fall 3.6 per cent next year.

Russia has been hit by what Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev recently called a 'perfect storm' of plummeting oil prices, sanctions related to its military action in Ukraine, and a flight of investors' capital. A lack of structural reforms has compounded the problem, making the economy overwhelmingly dependent on oil revenues.  

Kudrin, one of few to criticise President Vladimir Putin, said he believed the decline in the rouble could be attributed primarily to the sanctions, imposed following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and its subsequent support for loyalist fighters in the east.

In a move to contain the ruble crisis, the government today instructed five of the country's biggest state-controlled exporters to reduce their foreign currency assets to October levels and to not raise them again until March. The companies targeted were gas giant Gazprom, oil companies Rosneft and Zarubezhneft and diamond producers Alrosa and Kristall.

Today the ruble was steady as it has been for the past few trading sessions, floating around the 55 mark against the dollar. That's certainly an improvement on last week when the ruble plunged at one point to near 80 against the dollar.

With retailers, particularly of imported products, looking to pass costs onto consumers in light of the ruble's fall, jittery consumers rushed to buy cars and emptied shelves at electronics and home appliances stores to pre-empt the price rises. Others besieged bank offices to withdraw their deposits and buy dollars or euros - the panic that raised the threat of a full-fledged banking crisis if it's not contained quickly.

In response to the falling ruble, Russia's central bank last week increased its key interest rate to a whopping 17 per cent. Though that may help ease the selling pressure on the ruble by encouraging traders to hold onto the currency in anticipation of big returns, it is going to hobble Russian businesses and households.

Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Russia's current economic difficulties were exacerbated by Western sanctions, 'There are hopes to turn Russia into a pariah and reduce it to lower ranks in the ratings. This will never happen.'

Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev promised that the interest rate will be reduced once the ruble stabilizes, but acknowledged that the country faces the risk of a 'deep recession.'

Medvedev said Russia's current economic difficulties were exacerbated by Western sanctions. He said the economy is in a worse place now than in the 2008 crisis because 'a number of countries are effectively hampering the development of our economy.'

He said: 'There are hopes to turn Russia into a pariah and reduce it to lower ranks in the ratings. This will never happen.' 

Putin discussed the Ukraine crisis with the leaders of Germany, France and Ukraine by telephone yesterday, the Kremlin said, noting that a ceasefire had largely held in eastern Ukraine in recent days.

It said the leaders had emphasised the importance of removing heavy weapons and exchanging prisoners, but gave no indication of whether a breakthrough had been reached.

Government officials have tried to minimise the impact of sanctions on the country and its currency, which plunged 80 per cent against the dollar last week despite a hike in interest rates to 17 per cent. Putin has claimed 'external factors' like oil were the key factor behind the country's 'tough times'.

Kudrin warned that Russia risked having its debt downgraded to junk status in 2015.

He said: 'We have entered or are entering a real, full-fledged economic crisis. Next year we will feel it clearly.

Putin, seen above during a Russian press conference last week, discussed the Ukraine crisis with the leaders of Germany, France and Ukraine by telephone yesterday, the Kremlin said. It said the leaders had emphasised the importance of removing heavy weapons and exchanging prisoners, but gave no indication of whether a breakthrough had been reached.

'The government has not been quick enough to address the situation ... I am yet to hear ... its clear assessment of the current situation.'

Kudrin quit in 2011 in protest at proposals to increase defence spending, although he and Putin are still believed to be close. 

Mounting evidence suggested that Russia's economic pain and isolation were starting to bite.

The country announced plans to impose a heavy tax on grain exports since rouble volatility and high global prices have caused exports to spike:

And Russia's central bank said it would have to bail out mid-sized Trust Bank with 30 billion roubles (£347 million) to stop it going bankrupt. 

The country's largest lender Sberbank was forced to deny a report from RIA news agency that it had suspended taking new requests for auto loans and mortgages.

Though Russia's biggest oil firm Rosneft partially eased some worries by saying it had made a £4.5 billion debt repayment from its own cash reserves - investors had been concerned it could default because the sanctions cut off its access to Western finance. It announced separately that a deal to acquire an oil trading business from Morgan Stanley had been terminated due to a refusal by regulators in the U.S. to clear it.

Russia has been hit by what Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev recently called a 'perfect storm' of plummeting oil prices, sanctions related to its military action in Ukraine, and a flight of investors' capital. A lack of structural reforms has compounded the problem, making the economy overwhelmingly dependent on oil revenues

The termination of the deal is another blow for Rosneft after its partners including ExxonMobil withdrew from projects to develop Arctic offshore oil deposits after the sanctions were introduced.

Kudrin forecast a series of defaults among both medium and large companies, though he said banks would probably be supported by the state which was likely to result in rating agencies downgrading Russia's debt to 'junk' status. 

The rouble firmed against the dollar yesterday, with exporters responding to Putin's urge to sell their foreign currency revenues on the market, and Brent crude prices stood close to £38 a barrel.

While the currency, down some 45 per cent against the dollar so far this year, may stabilise in the first quarter of next year, its decline will likely help to push inflation to a rate of 12-15 per cent in 2015, Kudrin said.

The central bank envisages next year's inflation at around 8 per cent. Economists have predicted it would be as high as 9.2 percent.

Kudrin said he believed that between 25 and 35 per cent of the decline in the rouble could be attributed to sanctions. The rest, he said, was down to a stronger dollar and investors' mistrust of Russian authorities and their actions.

His outlook for the economy next year was bleak: Even if the price of oil rose to £51 per barrel, gross domestic product was still likely to fall by more than 2 per cent in 2015, Kudrin said. At £38 per barrel GDP would decline by 4 per cent or more, he added, echoing the central bank's latest assessment, published last week.
