Baring her breasts and winking at the camera, ‘Nicole from Bournemouth’ today brought to an end speculation that Page 3 had been killed off.

It had been widely thought the controversial segment in The Sun newspaper had been dropped after 44 years - and Government ministers welcomed the move.

The newspaper had not published pictures of topless glamour models since last Friday, instead advising readers the pictures would be available on its website.

But under the headline ‘Clarifications and Corrections’ on page three today, the paper published a topless photograph of the 22-year-old model.

It stated: ‘Further to recent reports in all other media outlets, we would like to clarify that this is Page 3 and this is a picture of Nicole, 22, from Bournemouth.

‘We would like to apologise on behalf of the print and broadcast journalists who have spent the last two days talking and writing about us.’

The No To Page 3 campaign group, which had all but declared victory in their battle to have the feature axed, admitted that its war was not yet won.

A spokesman said on Twitter: ‘So it seems the fight might be back on. Thanks to The Sun newspaper for all the publicity they've given the campaign. See you tomorrow.’

After reports the paper had decided to quietly drop the feature, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan and Liberal Democrat women's and equalities minister Jo Swinson were among those to express their delight at the apparent change.

Despite claims earlier this week in The Times newspaper, owned by Rupert Murdoch who also owns The Sun, that the feature had been dropped, the tabloid had refused to confirm the move.

Its head of public relations Dylan Sharpe stated on Twitter last night: ‘I said that it was speculation and not to trust reports by people unconnected to The Sun.’

Rupert Murdoch: The News Corp boss signalled last year that he was considering dropping the feature

Writing on Twitter to the No More Page 3 group she said: ‘May I humbly suggest that you now put your time & effort into something that actually matters like campaigning against FGM...’

Page 3 girl Rhian Sugden, 28, said earlier this week: ‘It's only a matter of time before everything we do will be dictated by comfy shoe-wearing, no bra-wearing, man-haters.’

The Page 3 pin-ups were introduced by the Sun in 1970, less than a year after Rupert Murdoch bought the title.

But the News Corp boss signalled last year that he was considering dropping the feature.

He asked his Twitter followers: ‘Aren't beautiful young women more attractive in at least some fashionable clothes?’

Mr Murdoch went on: ‘Brit feminists bang on forever about Page 3. I bet never buy paper. I think old fashioned but readers seem to disagree.’

Sarah Vine wrote in the Daily Mail yesterday that the demise of Page 3 being celebrated by the likes of Harriet Harman and No More Page 3 movement founder Lucy-Anne Holmes was 'no victory for feminism'.

The columnist said: 'Twenty years ago, I might have joined these ladies in their chorus of celebration. But the truth is, in the 21st century it has almost no significance whatsoever.'
