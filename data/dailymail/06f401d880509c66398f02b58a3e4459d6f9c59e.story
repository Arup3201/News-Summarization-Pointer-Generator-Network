Liverpool Football Club have issued a handbook detailing words and phrases that are unacceptable in its stands at Anfield.

In an effort to stamp out discrimination, the club has highlighted common slurs against race, religion, sexual orientation, gender and disability.

Included on the list are insults such as ‘Don’t be a woman’, ‘Man up’ and ‘You play like a girl’.

Liverpool’s players receive their own guidance as part of a separate Premier League initiative.

This latest move forms part of a wide-ranging programme to help other club employees identify discriminatory language that may be used by supporters on match days.

Liverpool’s social inclusion officer Rishi Jain said: ‘This programme of awareness enables our employees to recognise inappropriate language and take the necessary steps to ensure Anfield is free from all forms of discrimination.

‘Liverpool …has been recognised externally for its contribution to helping tackle discrimination and promote Anfield as an inclusive and welcoming environment.

‘The club has already attained (anti-racism initiative) Kick It Out’s equality standard preliminary level and has recently submitted its application for the equality standard intermediate level demonstrating its continued commitment.’
