A teenager accused of raping and murdering his high school math teacher told police how he knocked her out with a 'karate chop' before slicing her neck two times with a box cutter, a court has heard.

Detective Sergeant Phil Tansey from Danvers, Massachusetts, police described to a jury at Essex Superior Court how Philip Chism, now 14, described the details of Collen Rizter's grisly death after he was arrested in October 2013.

The youngster, who was 14 at the time, allegedly helped investigators recover the body by pointing to the spot on a map of woods behind Danvers High School where he dumped her corpse.

Tansey told the court that Chism confessed to murdering the popular 24-year-old during police interviews, but denied sexually assaulting her with a stick which was found near her body. 

Authorities say surveillance video from October 22, 2013, shows Chism following Ritzer into a bathroom in Danvers High School, wearing gloves and a hood, then later walking out of the bathroom alone.

Philip Chism, 15, (pictured during an appearance at Essex Superior Court last week) told detectives he killed teacher Collen Ritzer with a box cutter by slicing it across a neck, a court has heard 

Tansey's  statements came as Chism's lawyers look to throw out confessions and other evidence seized from him the night he was detained tossed out as evidence before trial.

Superior Court Judge David Lowy made no ruling; the hearing is expected to continue later this month.

A short time later, the video shows Chism pulling a recycling barrel through the school and outside.

Ritzer's body was later found in nearby woods, naked from the waist down and with her throat slit and a note that read, 'I hate you all.'

A recycling barrel was found near Ritzer's body. Authorities said she was sexually assaulted with a stick.

Earlier Friday, prosecutors called on state Police Detective Lt. Norman Zuk, who testified that Chism said a 'trigger word' had set him off before the murder. Zuk did not say what that word was.

Defense lawyers, meanwhile, called on Dr. Thomas Grisso, a retired University of Massachusetts professor and expert in juvenile psychiatry.

He testified about the ability of juveniles to understand the implications of waiving their right to not speak with police.

Allegations: The court heard that Chism (pictured last week) helped authorities locate her body by pointing at a map of the woods behind Danvers High School in Massachusetts. However he has denied sexually assaulting her with a stick

Grisso said adolescents tend to make decision based on 'what will that get me know' and can be more easily swayed than adults by the prospect of short-term benefits, such as getting to go home, sleep or eat.

Defense lawyers say Chism was detained by police for more than three hours after he was picked up around 12:30 a.m. on Oct. 23.

They say he had been handcuffed for most of the time, was not allowed to make a phone call and had asked a number of times for food.

Chism has pleaded not guilty to murder and aggravated rape. He is being tried as an adult.

Chism's lawyers say police coerced his mother, Diana, to get her then-14-year-old son into waiving his rights and making detailed statements about the murder.

Prosecutors maintain Chism, who had recently moved to Massachusetts from Clarksville, Tennessee, and his mother never absolutely invoked their right to a lawyer.

At a hearing last week, prosecutors played audio from Diana Chism's interview with police.

The mother said her son was 'capable of snapping' under the recent stress of his parents' separation and that his family had a history of mental health issues.

Two local police officers also testified they found Chism carrying Ritzer's ID and credit cards, a bloody box cutter and women's underwear. Chism told the officers a woman was 'buried in the woods' and could not be helped.
