The mother of a five-year-old boy mauled to death by her friend's adopted pit bull has bravely spoken out for the first time.

Heartbroken Michelle Ryan, from Oregon, said the tragic death of Jordan Michael Ryan on September 27 'feels like a horrible nightmare'.

Jordan was playing in the backyard while Ryan sat inside the house having a drink with her friend when the dog attacked, leaving the boy with 'extensive injuries, which caused him to bleed to death'.

Devastating: Michelle Ryan said the mauling death of her five-year-old son Jordan by a pit bull 'feels like a horrible nightmare'

The dog - recently adopted from a rescue program by Ryan's friend - has been euthanized. The other children were not injured.

Ryan said she took her children to the babysitter's house before she went to work.

As the two women talked inside, one of the children ran into the house. 

'I really didn't know that there was anything going wrong until one of her children came running and said, 'mom, mom the baby's getting chewed, the baby's getting chewed',' Ryan told KTVB.

'I rushed, while on the phone with the 911 operator, to the back door and that's where I saw my little boy. And I just knew that, the way I seen him, it wasn't good.

'Unfortunately the worst case scenario did come true. It feels like it's a horrible nightmare.'

The kindergarten student died on the way to the hospital.

'I'm never going to see him ride his bike, and tell me how they called him 'Jumper' again,' Ryan said.

'Or how he's never going to beg me to bring him to grandma and grandpa's house and tell me that it's his time for grandpa time. And I think about it and I'm just like, my god, he's really gone.'

She said her son loved being with his family, playing with children in the neighborhood and looking after a white kitten named Lily.

'How do I pick up the pieces and put on a face to where people can think that I'm okay even though I'm dying inside? How can I pick up the pieces and make him proud,' Ryan said.

A public memorial to celebrate his short life was held a few days after his death outside the kindergarten he attended in a wing of Baker High School. His grieving father, Nathan Craig, also attended.

Police are investigating the fatal attack.

'Once the (police) investigation is complete I will review the case for potential criminal charges, or determine whether the case needs to be presented to the grand jury,' District Attorney Matt Shirtcliff told Baker City Herald.
