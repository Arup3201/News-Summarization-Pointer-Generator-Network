Diego Costa showed no signs of being bothered by his troublesome hamstring as he trained ahead of Spain's Euro 2016 qualifiers against Slovakia and Luxembourg.

The Chelsea forward was joined by club-mate Cesc Fabregas and fellow Premier League stars David Silva and David de Gea. 

Vicente del Bosque's team crushed Macedonia 5-1 in their opening qualifier and now turn their attention to Slovakia and Luxembourg.

Costa, who has scored nine times in nine matches for Chelsea this season, has struggled for goals when leading the line for Spain. He has failed to hit the back of the net in five games for his country but this is not an issue that worries his international team-mates.

'He has told me he is looking forward to scoring. At the moment they aren't coming but after the first then they will start to flow,' said Koke, Costa's former team-mate at Atletico Madrid.

'He is a goalscorer and it will work out with the national team. In England he is scoring from everywhere and it has worked out for him to go there.

'Diego has to fit in with us but also we have to find him when he has space and can get free. With his movement he has the ability to get one-on-one with the keeper.'

Spain's manager Vicente del Bosque says his team are going through a transitional period at the moment

Del Bosque, meanwhile, is unfazed by his team's disastrous performance at the World Cup in Brazil. 

The 63-year-old says the team is in transition, but is full of confidence despite the summer failure.

'We are going through a change,' he said.

'We need to forget Brazil because football doesn't stop and we now have fresh faces who are in high spirits and looking forward to a new start.'
