When it comes to adding friends on Facebook, some people are selective, while others are keen to add everyone they meet.

If you fall into the latter category, a new wristband could help make connecting with these people faster and easier.

The band has been created by a Belgian music festival and it sends friend requests to nearby people at the touch of a button.

The technology is built into the wristbands for the Tomorrowland festival in Belgium. Festival-goers register the band and connect it to their Facebook account and then, when at the event, can pair bands by pressing the heart button (illustration pictured)

Earlier this month, Barclays released 
its latest wristband that lets wearers pay for a morning coffee as well 
as their daily commute.

Wearers
 swipe the bPay bands, which can be worn 24 hours a day, over a terminal
 at a shop or pay point on the bus or station platform to make a 
purchase.

The rubberised 
waterproof bands, which contain a computer chip and micro-aerial to 
communicate with terminals, have the security benefit that they are less
 likely to be lost or stolen than a wallet or purse.

The technology has been incorporated into the wristbands for the Tomorrowland festival taking place later this month in Boom, Belgium.

Before the event, festival-goers are encouraged to register their band online and connect it to their Facebook account. 

At the event, if they meet someone they want to be friends on Facebook with, the two users have to press the heart button on the band at the same time.

This pairs the bands and sends the respective account details to each wearer.

However, it doesn’t automatically accept requests.
