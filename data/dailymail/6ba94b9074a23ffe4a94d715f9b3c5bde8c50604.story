Tensions between the UK and Spain over the sovereignty of Gibraltar increased today after Spanish jets forced the delay of a British Airways flight.

Angry government officials demanded the issue be raised at the highest levels after four fighter planes were accused of entering Gibraltar airspace during a military exercise in the area.

Officials in the British territory insist no warning was given prior to the incursion and that the commercial BA flight was subsequently forced to wait on the tarmac for 12 minutes.

The Gibraltar government has called on the UK to bring the matter up with Spain on the 'highest diplomatic and military levels' after four Spanish fighter planes allegedly entered its airspace

The alleged incursion delayed a British Airways flight to London by 12 minutes and 'no warning was given'

Incident may intensify the diplomatic row between Britain and Spain coming just days after David Cameron confronted his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rajoy (right) over Spanish police entering British waters

Eyewitnesses described seeing the 
jets pass very close to the Rock in an incident described by military 
personnel as 'being buzzed'.

'The Government of Gibraltar has called on the UK to take up the matter 
of this military incursion into the airspace of Gibraltar at the highest
 diplomatic and military levels,' said a government spokesman.

A foreign office official added: 'We have raised this with London and Madrid.'

The jets are understood to have come from a Spanish aircraft carrier, Juan Carlos I, based about 10 miles from the Rock.

Spanish Defence Ministry deny that Spanish fighter jets entered Gibraltar airspace.

A Gibraltar government spokesman said: 'At no time did the aircraft make
 contact with Gibraltar's air-traffic control and the Spanish air 
traffic authorities in Seville gave no warning of the aircrafts' 
approach.'

The incident comes just days after Prime Minister David Cameron 
complained to his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rajoy over an incident in 
which a British jet skier was allegedly shot at by Spanish police in the
 waters surrounding the Rock.

Britain was plunged into a diplomatic crisis over Gibraltar after Spanish police fired shots at British jet-skier Dale Villa, pictured, in waters around the Rock

It comes after Spanish police twice entered British waters once, in a public rebuke to British warnings not to do so.

Last week, the Foreign Office protested to the 
Spanish government after a boat from Spain’s Guardia Civil entered 
Gibraltan waters and took potshots at 32-year-old Dale Villa as he rode 
his jet-ski close to a popular beach.

Just three days later, a police boat was seen in British waters again.

Mr Cameron said: ‘I have raised this 
with the Spanish Prime Minister. I think this is a totally unacceptable 
episode and I made that clear.

‘I think it’s very important the 
people of Gibraltar know that we support them, we support their 
sovereignty, we will always stand up for them and stand by them.

‘I think it’s very important countries obey all the international rules, all the international laws.’

Spain's foreign ministry denied that 
any shots were fired, and accused the British Government of granting too
 much credibility to a 'rumour'.

But Mr Cameron made clear that he thought the Spanish police had breached international rules.

The PM added: ‘We need to find out 
more about exactly what happened but from all I've heard from the First 
Minister in Gibraltar it’s not acceptable and that's why I raised the 
issue and I think we can avoid these incidents in future.'

Worrying: The jet ski rider said he had been taking friends and family members on rides when he was chased by the Guardia Civil vessel

Father-of-three Mr 
Villa described how he had been fired at on two separate occasions as he
 tested his new jet-ski with family and friends on Sunday afternoon.

‘I was very shaken and furious,’ said the delivery driver.

‘When
 a huge boat is hurling after you and you hear gunshots it is very 
scary. There were three policemen on the boat and I actually saw one of 
them with a gun in his hand.

The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a major source of tension between the UK and Spain.

Both in 1967 and 2002, the people of Gibraltar rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty.

Yet, despite this, Spain still asserts a claim to the territory.

The tension began in 1704 when an Anglo-Dutch force captured Gibraltor from Spain during the war of the Spanish succession.

The territory was then ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713.

Historically, it has proved to be an important base for the Royal Navy.

Now, its economy is based on tourism, financial services and shipping.

Under the 2006 constitution of Gibraltar, the territory governs its own 
affairs although defence and foreign relations are still the 
responsibility of the UK Government.

Located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula, it is an area of 6.8 square kilometres.

‘I was just about to drop my friend 
off at West Beach when I heard the first shot. I don’t really think we 
took it seriously or believed it could be a gun, but clearly it was.

‘I
 jumped back on again and whizzed off before realising the boat was 
chasing after me and had soon fired three more shots at me.

‘I
 had only just taken my friend’s ten-year-old daughter out for a spin 
and was about to pick up her grandmother so we were not being 
threatening or doing anything wrong.

‘Maybe
 these guys were bored – it being a Sunday – but I really hope something
 is going to be done about it, as it is outrageous.’

Shots can be heard 
on a grainy video filmed by a witness.

British sources said it was 
thought the Spanish police fired rubber bullets at the man.

The UK’s charge d’affaires in Madrid was also despatched to make direct representations to ministers in the Spanish capital.

The
 incident is believed to have been witnessed by an off-duty officer from
 the Royal Gibraltar Police, which has launched a formal investigation.

But a spokesman for Spain’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said ‘no 
incident’ had taken place’ and ‘no shot fired’.

Britain was given Gibraltar in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, but Spain has said it will never renounce its claim to sovereignty.

British
 sources said Gibraltar suffered frequent illegal incursions into its 
waters by Spanish boats, including police and naval vessels. From 
December last year to April, officials recorded 176 illegal incursions 
by Spanish boats.
