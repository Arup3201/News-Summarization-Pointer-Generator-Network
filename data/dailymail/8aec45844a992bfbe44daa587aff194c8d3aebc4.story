The plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife Carolyn Bessette and her sister sparked a feud between the Kennedy family and the heartbroken mother of the Bessettes before the bodies were even found, it was claimed today.

Just two days after the plane flown by President John F. Kennedy's son went down in the Atlantic Ocean off Martha's Vineyard in 1999, the Kennedys met with Bessette's mother Ann Freeman and 'bullied her' over the final resting places of the three victims, according to revelations.

The accounts of the meeting were taken from JFK Jr.'s cousin - Robert F. Kennedy Jr. - and published in the New York Post. They come from RFK Jr.'s diary, which was given to the Post after they were found at his ex-wife Mary Kennedy's house following her suicide in 2012.

Tragic: John F. Kennedy Jr. - the son of President Kennedy - is seen here with wife Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy. The couple died when JFK Jr.'s plane crashed in 1999

Buried at sea: The remains of JFK Jr., his wife Carolyn and her sister Lauren were cremated and scattered at sea during a ceremony aboard the Navy destroyer USS Biscoe

RFK Jr. writes that on July 18 - before the bodies of JFK Jr. and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy and Lauren Bessette were recovered - Ann Bessette began asking that her two daughters be buried near her home in Greenwich, Connecticut.

'Ann wants them close by and is terrified that the K family might try to spirit them to Brookline,' RFK Jr. writes.

Several Kennedys are buried at Holyhood Cemetary in Brookline, Massachusetts - including patriarch and matriarch Joseph and Rose Kennedy - the parents of President Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Senator Ted Kennedy.

The revelations come from the diary of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

A meeting was set up between Ann Freeman and the Kennedys. JFK Jr.'s sister Caroline Kennedy was supposed to go to represent the Kennedy family.

She sent her husband Ed Schlossberg instead.

RFK Jr. writes: 'All the Bessette family knows that Ed hated Carolyn and did 
everything in his power to make her life miserable.

'He bullied,
bullied, bullied the shattered grieving mother.'

Schossberg's treatment of the Bessette family in the aftermath of the crash seemed to create a rift in the Kennedy family. 

At one point after the funerals, Carole Radziwill, the wife of Anthony Radziwill, JFK Jr.’s cousin and close friend, called RFK Jr. to complain about Schlossberg.

'She says she wants to start an "I hate Ed Club." There would be many, many members. John & Carolyn would have certainly applied,' RFK Jr. writes.

Ultimately, the arguments turned out to be much ado about nothing. The families decided to have the victims' remains cremated and buried at sea near where they died.

RFK Jr. recounts the beautiful scene from aboard the Navy destroyer USS Briscoe - which carried the grieving family out the sea.

'The water had more jellyfish in it than anyone had ever seen. When they let go of the ashes, the plume erupted and settled in the water and passed by in the green current like a ghost. We tossed flowers onto the ghosts,' he writes.

'Some of the girls tossed letters from a packet they’d assembled from John’s and Carolyn’s friends. It was a civil violation but the Coast Guard let it go.'

JFK Jr. and wife Carolyn were compared to President Kennedy and First Lady Jackie Kennedy because of their seemingly fairy tale romance
