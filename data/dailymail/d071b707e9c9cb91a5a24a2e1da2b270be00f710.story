A Labour MP was criticised yesterday after he posed for a picture with his son – who had blacked up for a fancy dress party.

Ian Lavery, 51, smiled for the camera with Ian Jnr, who was dressed as Michael Jackson in Thriller.

The picture which was then posted on Facebook incited racist comments from the 25-year-old’s friends.

One called him a ‘n*****’ and an immigrant, to which Lavery Jnr responded by saying his father must be proud of him.

His father, the MP for Wansbeck in Northumberland, held a pint as he appeared unperturbed by his son’s attire, which comprised of a wig, black face paint and him doing a ‘thumbs up’.

His presence in the picture sparked outrage among the MPs’ constituents who said they found it offensive and ‘racist’.

One said: ‘I was appalled and shocked when I saw these photos of Ian Lavery Jr.

‘These images show him dressed in an appalling racist costume, as well as this he has ‘liked’ every one of the racist comments posted next to the photo by his friends.

‘For the MP to have his photo taken with his son in this costume shows total disrespect.’

A Tory councillor said it was a ‘very public racist act’ and demonstrated the MP’s hypocrisy.

It is not the first time Lavery Jnr, whose Twitter reads ‘Never base your life on other people’s expectations’, has sparked controversy.

Last year he described Katie Price’s son Harvey, who is disabled, as a ‘vegetable’, while making a crude reference to the model.

While Lavery Jnr describes himself as a funky house DJ, from Ashington, Northumberland, his brother, Liam Lavery, 20, has followed in his father’s footsteps and is a town councillor.

Declined to comment: Mr Lavery is MP for Wansbeck in Northumberland

He posted the ‘racist’ photograph with the comment: ‘Me and the father’. His friends responded with offensive comments, including ones that he ‘liked’.

One wrote: ‘ha ha f****** mint your dads probably thinking whos the immagrant (sic).’ Another wrote: ‘haha, he must be so proud of u lank’, to which Lavery Jnr responded, ‘must b’.

One other Facebook friend wrote ‘lanky the n****’. The Facebook page has since been deleted.

Councillor Peter Jackson, leader of Northumberland Conservatives, said: ‘There is a total hypocrisy with this very public racist act.

‘It seems the comments that go with it confirm that it is a racist act.

‘Ian Lavery as an MP is a very vocal and is always trying to take the moral high ground, this is a demonstration of his total hypocrisy.

‘The Labour candidates up here seem to think they can get away with any type of behaviour and they can get away with it.’

At the time of his ‘vegetable’ comment on Twitter, Katie Price, 35, criticised Lavery Jnr and his father, who is patron of brain injury charity Headway.

She said: ‘This makes me sick to my stomach. Not just that someone could be so vile as to think such a thing, but also could think it clever to repeat to the world on Twitter?

‘What kind of father, what kind of MP, is Ian Lavery? He’s the patron of Headway - yet he brings his son up to think and act like this?

‘These disgusting comments aimed at Harvey all too often get aimed at other disabled children and the poor souls his father’s charity rightly campaigns for.

‘This is just as much a hate crime as racism and should be treated as such.’ Mr Lavery, 51, said at the time: ‘I’m absolutely appalled by it but I cannot police my kids and I have no intention to. They have to learn how to behave in the big wide world like I did.’

Lavery Jnr reacted angrily when initially confronted on Twitter. He said: ‘Does no f***** listen? Yes it was a sick joke that’s why it got deleted! Obviously some t*** managed to take a pic before it was deleted. Stop going on about it for f*** sake!’

But eventually he said he was ‘ashamed’ and apologised ‘unreservedly’ to Katie, adding: ‘I feel so stupid. I didn’t actually find it funny.’

Mr Lavery’s youngest son was yesterday very defensive about the photograph. He said he did not believe his brother or his father would want to comment about the picture. He said: ‘He didn’t post the comments on the picture.’

Mr Lavery and Mr Lavery Jnr declined to comment.
