First-time buyers are being priced out of the areas where they grew up by a North-South divide on property values.

Just one in 10 homes in parts of the south are within financial reach of people on average local wages trying to get on the property ladder.

But further north in areas like Hull, Middlesbrough and Bradford where up to 80 per cent of houses are within budget.

Divide: First-time buyers struggle to get on the property ladder in the south but many more homes are within their reach in the north, according to a survey

The survey by search engine Adzuna.co.uk showed that Chichester in West Sussex is the least affordable place in the UK.

Only 11 per cent of properties are considered affordable, assuming joint mortgage multiple of 2.75 times average salaries and a 25 per cent deposit.

With so few houses available to first-time buyers, many are forced to move to cheaper areas.

A couple earning an average wage in Chichester could afford more than half of properties in Portsmouth 30 miles away or 40 per cent of homes in Bournemouth, 60 miles down the road, the survey found.

Andrew Hunter, of Adzuna, said: ‘With rates of pay falling and property prices rising, it's clear that homes in Britain are becoming less affordable and that we are in a renters' not a buyers' market.’

The most affordable cities for house-hunters are almost exclusively in the North, with average prices of around £125,000 in Hull, Middlesbrough and Bradford, 2.2 times an average couple's earnings.

Chichester, Oxford and Guildford were found to be the least affordable places in the country, while properties in Ipswich, Cambridge and Wolverhampton have become more unaffordable in the past year than in any part of the UK.

Lending to first-time buyers has hit its largest quarterly total since 2007 with 68,200 purchasing their first home in the second quarter of 2013

House price increases were higher for people buying their first home than for those already on the property ladder

Young
buyers are crucial for a thriving housing market, with sales to this 
group acting as a trigger for purchases all the way up the property ladder.

However, house prices are rising faster for first-time buyers than for those people already on the property ladder.

In June 2013 prices were up 3.9 per cent year-on-year for first time buyers, but for existing owners they rose by 2.7 per cent.

Latest figures suggest the property market has burst into 
life with a 30 per cent surge in the number of first-time buyers who 
have been given mortgages.

Loans
to young buyers desperate to realise their home-owning dream are back 
up to the levels seen before the bank crash of 2007, new figures show.

At the same time house prices increased by 3.1 per cent in the 12 months to June, with most regions seeing rises.

Some 25,300 mortgages were advanced 
to first-time buyers in June, up from 19,400 in the same month last 
year, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML).

This took the total for the three months to the end of June to 68,500, which was the highest level in more than five years.
