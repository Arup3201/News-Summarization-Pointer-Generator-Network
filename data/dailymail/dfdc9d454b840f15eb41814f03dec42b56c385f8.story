The term 'you want the ground to swallow you up' was coined for THAT moment at White Hart Lane on Wednesday night.

Slumped on his knees, crestfallen on the floor, Roberto Soldado would happily have disappeared into the turf.

How on earth do you hit the crossbar from six yards? By the look on the Spaniard's face, not even he could tell you.

Spanish striker Soldado somehow manages to hit the bar from close-range when it appeared easier to score

With the goal gaping the 29-year-old could only hit the crossbar as he miss hit his effort

Tottenham - 59 apps, 15 goals

Valencia - 128 apps, 76 goals

Getafe - 60 apps, 29 goals

Osasuna - 30 apps, 11 goals 

But it's a feeling that has become all too familiar for Soldado.

Perhaps, not quite to the extent of his extraordinary miss against Burnley - but it is the lack of goals that has defined his Spurs career so far.

Fifteen goals in 18 months isn't an impressive return on a £26million outlay.

So, then, it's no surprise that manager Mauricio Pochettino is listening to offers for the striker this month.

It just hasn't happened for the former Valencia man.

Soldado has only managed to score four goals in all competitions this season

Having arrived in north london in 2013 as one of La Liga's most prolific marksman, Soldado's reputation has plummeted severely.

He's gone from being one of the most sought after players in Europe, to a major financial liability for Spurs.

Offloading Soldado will be easier said than done this month.

Spurs know they'll have to take a significant financial hit on the £26million they splashed on him.

Likewise, clubs prepared to match the player's £65,000-per-week wages are likely to be few and far between.

A return to Spain seems the most likely destination for the striker.

Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino is happy to persist with Soldado until the end of the season

Atletico Madrid have been linked with a move for the misfiring hitman, though there has also been an interest from Inter Milan.

Who knows, maybe even they are having second thoughts after watching his incredible miss on Wednesday night.

But it must be said that if a deal for Soldado to leave White Hart Lane this month isn't reached, then Pochettino is happy to persist with the Spaniard until the end of the season.

The striker is a popular member of the Spurs squad, and Pochettino has been impressed with the Spaniard's attitude - which is more than can be said with regards to another White Hart Lane striker.

His goalscoring apart, the other aspects of Soldado's play is certainly appreciated by his team-mates.

Soldado scored 24 league goals in his final season at Valencia before securing Spurs move

And in the face of criticism following his embarrassing miss against Burnley, his colleagues have rallied round in his defence.

'I felt for him. I have been in that position before where just nothing will go in for you,' said Andros Townsend.

'He played well but as a striker I think he just wanted that goal.

'I just ran over to him as we walked off at half time and tried to keep his spirits up. I just told him to forget about the miss and keep going.

'I said I would try to put another cross in for him and that if he kept getting into the positions then he would get a goal.

Andros Townsend said he offered some words of encouragement to Soldado at half time

'That didn’t happen sadly but five minutes into the second half he put in an assist for Danny Rose.

'Look Robbie is a fantastic character, he will pick himself up and dust himself down.

'He continued to look dangerous in the second half and I was delighted he played well. We have seen in Spain he is a fantastic striker. He just needs the service and the game time.

'Then once he gets one or two goals I am sure the goals will start flowing.'

Here's hoping, for Soldado's sake.
