The defender, who controversially joined Spurs via a spell at Standard Liege after leaving Manchester United, has been deemed surplus to requirements by Mauricio Pochettino.

Warnock has only signed fans' favourite Wilfied Zaha on a season-long loan since rejoining Palace last week.

Co-owner Steve Parish fell out with previous manager Tony Pulis over spending plans for the transfer window but with Palace currently in the bottom three without a win this season, new boss Warnock has highlighted the urgency of new blood on deadline day.
