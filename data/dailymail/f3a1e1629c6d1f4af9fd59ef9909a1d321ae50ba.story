A suspected burglar perched in a tree overhanging a railway line caused 17 hours of travel misery for commuters.

The strong-willed fugitive climbed the tree near Charlton station in south-east London in the early hours of yesterday, and refused to come down throughout the morning rush hour.

He had been chased by police after an alleged attempted burglary at a nearby retail park shortly before 2am, in a pursuit involving the Metropolitan Police helicopter.

Emergency services spent hours trying to coax the man, pictured left, out of the tree

Delays caused by the incident sparked fury among passengers with a number of London-bound trains diverted or delayed.

British Transport Police (BTP) sent specialist officers to try to persuade him to come down from the tree near Barney Close, but rail operator Southeastern was forced to close the track during the morning peak.

Chief Inspector Jenny Gilmer said: 'Shortly after 7pm on Wednesday 13 August, a man was talked down from a tree near to the rail line at Charlton.

'The man had been in the tree since the early hours of the morning and his return to the ground marked the end of a difficult and lengthy operation involving British Transport Police, Met Police, London Fire and Rescue, Network Rail and Southeastern Trains.

'The 32-year-old man was subsequently arrested on suspicion of burglary and obstruction of trains with intent and he remains in police custody.

'I'd like to thank all those who have worked tirelessly throughout the day to bring this operation to a safe conclusion and would also like to thank the local community and travelling public for their continuing patience and understanding during what was an extremely sensitive process.'

Southeastern said that the tree overhangs the London-bound track and so it was not safe to run services while the man refused to come down - although trains out of London were able to run normally after an initial closure.

London-bound services were diverted or delayed, and tickets were accepted on the Underground and buses.

But the delays angered passengers, many of whom took to Twitter to vent their frustration.

Adam Martin-Lawrence wrote: 'How many people does it take to drag a burglar out of a tree at Charlton - apparently many, but none of them can lay a finger on the guy.'

Another Twitter user, Jess Williams, posted: 'So just found out the reason my train was cancelled this morning was because a man running from the police was hiding up a tree at Charlton.

A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'Police were called to reports of an attempted burglary at a commercial unit on the Stone Lake Retail Park, SE7, at 1.50am on August 13.

'On arrival, officers identified a suspect and began a pursuit which also involved the Metropolitan Police's Air Support Unit, during which the man was observed running close to rail lines.

'The suspect subsequently climbed a tree next to the rail lines off Barney Close.'
