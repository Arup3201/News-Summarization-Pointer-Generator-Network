From the Pyramids at Giza to the ancient marvels on display at the British Museum, the world is full of wonders.

But while most of us can be relied upon to enjoy them responsibly, it would seem there are some who simply can't be trusted.

From the tourist who caught, cooked and ate one of the world's rarest sea creatures to the travellers who defiled one of Ireland's most spectacular beauty spots, www.cracked.com tracked down the visitors who definitely won't be invited back

Defaced: 14-year-old Ding Jinhao etched 'Ding Jinhao was here' on a 3,000-year-old temple in Luxor, Egypt

Magnificent: The spectacular Cliffs of Moher overlook the Atlantic Ocean on the west coast of County Clare

Ruined: But a pair of French 'artists' named 'Mama' and 'Dirty Edoir' decided they needed repainting

THE VANDAL

In May, a teenager named Ding Jinhao was found to have etched 'Ding Jinhao was here' on a 3,000 year old temple in Luxor, Egypt.

Discovered by a micro-blogger - who promptly posted his findings online - the teen's vandalising ways caused outrage across China and were widely condemned as disrespectful.

'We want to apologise to the Egyptian people and to people who have paid attention to this case across China,' Ding's mother told Nanjing paper, Modern Express.

Blogger Shen, who made the discovery, said: 'I felt embarrassed. It was my most unhappy moment in Egypt.'

14-year-old Ding isn't the only Chinese tourist to have caused outrage at home after putting doodles in the wrong place abroad.

In March 2009, a retired man from Changzhou infuriated his fellow countrymen after etching his name on a rock at Taiwan's Yehliu Geopark.

THE GRAFFITI ARTISTS

Towering 360ft above the Atlantic on the west coast of Country Clare, Ireland's Cliffs of Moher attract more than 860,000 visitors every year.

But in February, those visitors included a pair of French hitchhikers who chose to use their time at the Cliffs to create an 8ft tall mural on the rock near the spectacular Hag's Head.

The pair, who call themselves 'Mama' and 'Dirty Edoir', then uploaded a short film of them defacing the beauty spot on Vimeo.

According to the video, the duo are 
part of a group called Dirty EST, an arts collective based in Paris who 
focus on graffiti, painting, urban photography, sculpture and short 
film.

And not content with spray-painting the Cliffs of Moher, the pair then went on to deface other sites in Galway and Dublin.

'The Burren and Cliffs of Moher 
Geopark have a Leave No Trace policy and would strongly encourage all 
visitors to support this,' geologist Dr Eamon Doyle, told the BBC in the
wake of the visit from the French pair.

'As geologist for the Burren and 
Cliffs of Moher Geopark, my main concern is that this graffiti will lead
to other copycat graffiti in more public and vulnerable areas and will 
detract from the much more important story that lies within the rocks.'

Broken: Patrick Broderick, 56, from Connecticut snapped the finger off this statue while trying to measure it

Furious: The American curator was outraged and it is believed the tourist has apologised for his silly behaviour

THE STATUE SMASHER

Last
week, Patrick Broderick, 56, from New Fairfield, Connecticut sparked fury across 
Italy after breaking the little finger off a 600-year-old statue in 
Florence.

According to local reports, the man said he hadn't intended to break the finger and had instead been attempting to compare his finger to that on the marble sculpture.

The
sculpture, which was created in the late 15th century by artist 
Giovanni D'Ambrogio, is housed in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, which 
has now received an apology from the offending tourist.

The
museum's head, American Timothy Verdon, said: 'In a globalised world 
like ours, the fundamental rules for visiting a museum have been 
forgotten, that is, "Do not touch the works."'

THE MAN WHO MUNCHED AN ENDANGERED SQUID

Nothing beats a spot of fishing while on holiday but American tourist, Labros Hydras, found himself with more on his plate than he expected white on holiday in Greece.

During a snorkelling trip, Hydras unearthed a rare 'hexapus' - an extremely rare octopus with just six tentacles - but despite suspecting it might be something special, killed it and whisked it off to be cooked in a beachside taverna.

The hexapus killed by Mr Hydras was only the second ever discovered - a fact Mr Hydras only found out when he returned home and asked a marine biologist friend.

Catch: Labros Hydras his daughter Areti, ten, and son Arion, six admire the six legged octopus or hexapus which they found while on holiday in Greece

Fishing: The specimen was pulled from the sea by US citizen Labros Hydras as he went snorkelling in Greece

Hexapus: The chef refused to cook it for him but he fried it himself and served it with tomato and lemon

A repentant Mr Hydras said: â€˜It 
tasted just like a normal octopus but now I feel really bad. When we 
caught it, there was nothing to suggest it was any different or had been
damaged.

'I thought it had been born with six 
tentacles. We go to Greece every year and when we catch an octopus, we 
do the same thing so we just did not think about it.

'I wanted to find out more, but there
was no internet where we were. I then called my friend who is a 
biologist and he told me it was true and I was horrified.'

THE CALLOUS MEN WHO MANHANDLED A DYING DOLPHIN

For the majority of travellers, just catching a glimpse of a dolphin is thrill enough. But it would seem that not everyone agrees.

When a dolphin was hit by a boat and washed towards the shore in the Hainan province of China, far from attempting to help the stricken animal, a group of tourists decided to pose with it instead.

The dying creature was lifted up and manhandled, while the male travellers pulled muscleman poses around it.

When it finally died, reports in the local Shanghai Daily revealed that it had perished from 'excessive bleeding' - not helped by the antics of the men.

Fury: The shocking pictures caused outrage when they were posted on a Chinese social networking site

Cruel: These travellers decided to pose for pictures with a dying dolphin rather than helping it

The photos of the incident, which 
took place in June, were then posted on the Chinese social networking 
site, Sina Weibo, and caused fury among other users.

'When even the basic respect of life is lost, I just want to say, how can I be proud of you, China?' one user said.

'Dolphins, as highly evolved mammals,
have an IQ only a little lower than humans. But those people in the 
pictures are worse than pigs,' wrote another.
