Being kept up at night by the sound of neighbours or because you live on a busy road is not uncommon - but a French couple was left sleep deprived and depressed because of a noisy peacock next door.

The husband and wife, from Marseille in southern France, sued the town hall after they alleged that they had been left depressed and suffering from insomnia because of the animal's persistent squawking.

The couple said that they both had to resort to psychotherapy because of the noise.

The peacock was given to the local mayor
 in 2008 as a present. But the bird often escaped its pen and had been 
running loose in the 9th district of Marseille - next to the Maison Blanche park in the city.

In 2009, after the bird had escaped numerous times, council workers were sent out to the park to find the peacock but were unsuccessful in finding the perpetrator.

The peacock was eventually found and shipped off to a farm outside Marseille.

In court, medical documents were shown confirming that the couple had been suffering from insomnia and depression.

In 2012, the pair tried to sue the town hall but were awarded just £82 in compensation.

Outraged, they opened the case again this year and were paid out £1,658 in damages after a court concluded that the council had not done enough to control the bird.

After claiming legal costs, the couple received a total payout of £3,316.

Despite their beautiful appearance, peacocks are known for their shrill cries, similar to the sound of an old-fashioned horn being blasted. The cry is not dissimilar to a seagull.

To attract a partner, the bird makes a hooting noise and cocks its leg.
