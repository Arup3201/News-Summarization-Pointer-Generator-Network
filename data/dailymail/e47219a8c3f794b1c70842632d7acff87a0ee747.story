A cafe owner has outraged mothers and fathers after posting on social media that parents with badly-behaved children should steer clear of her cafe. 

On Monday The Little French Cafe in Broadmeadow, Newcastle, north of Sydney, asked customers to refrain from bringing their unruly offspring into the establishment in a Facebook post, which has since been removed.

But the cafe's owner Jodie Morris said despite some parents taking aim at her stance, the response had been overwhelming positive _ and she stands by the post.

'Everyone's said oh you're going to lose so much business but we're the busiest we've ever been,' Ms Morris told Daily Mail Australia.

Owner of The Little French Cafe Jodie Morris (pictured) wrote a message on Facebook warning customers to keep their unruly kids away from her cafe after being criticised for not being child-friendly

This post sparked controversy and debate among people, some who attacked the cafe owner for excluding parents

However Jodie Morris has stuck to her guns saying that she built the cafe on her own and has the right to dictate her clientele

In the post that kicked it all off the cafe owner said that she was not 'child-friendly' unless kids were willing to sit at the table without running around the cafe and disrupting other diners.

 'If you are looking for a cafe with a children’s menu, baby chinos, a play area, lounges for your children to jump on, vast space for your prams, an area for your children to run rampant, and annoy other customers, whilst you are oblivious to them - then the short answer is no we are not child friendly,' she wrote.

A mother herself, the owner stood by her comments in follow up posts declaring her rules had nothing to do with discrimination and everything to do with people being respectful.

The public declaration came after a customer gave her scathing one-star review, posing the question 'are you child friendly - because it doesn't seem like it'.

Jodie responded by saying that the cafe was situated in a prominent business area, and defended her position by stating that as the owner it was ultimately her decision to decide the clientele she wanted to attract.

Many people have come out in support of Jodie's decision, praising her honesty

The cafe owner insisted she wasn't discriminating as she has children of her own

Jodie said she was simply within her rights to remind people there's a time and a place for rowdy behaviour

However some people weren't too pleased with the stance, commenting that she should be able to take her kids anywhere

Others said it was excluding people and losing out on much of the market

'I built the cafe myself. It has my blood sweat and plenty of tears in it. It is beautifully decorated, old fireplaces, French furniture, and we use fine old china etc,' she wrote.

'I have been subjected to children emptying salt and pepper shakers into my fireplaces, parents changing nappies on my lounges, kids grinding their own food into my carpet, parents sitting babies in nappies in the middle of dining tables, kids running around the cafe like it's a formula 1 track, jumping on the furniture, screaming - just for fun - not pain, and encouraged by their parents, upsetting the rest of the customers and I'd really just had enough.

'And yes, I am a mother. A single mother at that. Instead of being a "burden" on society, I scrimped every last penny and put it into this cafe, and I'm very proud of it. When I have to stand there and watch people disrespect and damage MY belongings and property, it breaks a piece of my heart every time.

'Some will agree with my stance, some will not, but it's my stance for my business,' Jodie concluded.

And despite warnings from critics that defending what some parents called an 'attack' aimed at them would result in damage to the business, the cafe owner revealed that the controversy had the exact opposite effect. 

The cafe owner revealed in one of her social media posts she 'built the cafe myself. It has my blood sweat and plenty of tears in it'

She also said she would welcome children who are well-behaved and won't ruin the place

The decision has sparked a fierce debate leaving vocal parents divided on the issue

Many social media users thought the stance would attract more customers 

Some others criticised the parents of disruptive children

This person said they would make a special trip the cafe if they were even in the right state 

'It's definitely positive but there is also those out there that aren't happy .. I've never said no they can't come in I just said they have to be well-behaved ... Parents don't like to be told what to do with their kids.'

'If they came to my house and behaved like that they wouldn't come back so why should they come back to my cafe?,' Jodie told Daily Mail Australia.

'I am a parent, I understand there's a time and a place ... And somewhere where's there's tables and food and hot drinks is not the place.'

The comments on her latest Facebook post reflect this, with many people praising her decision to take a stand.

Robyn Gibson Borruso wrote: 'It is not a question of being 'child friendly' but more a question of being 'well-behaved child friendly'. I too am a mother of two children and have spent many years teaching my kids how to behave appropriately in restaurants.

'Those parents who jump on their high horse about our 'house rules' are generally those ones who ignore their manic offspring while they disturb everyone else around them. Good on you for taking a stand!!'

Some customers jumped to Jodie's defence saying they wished more eateries would take a similar stance

Jodie revealed despite warnings the comments might hurt her business the cafe is booming

This person said not having children was their choice and reveled in the fact there was a place to go 

While this user suggested a mass protest against Jodie

Emily agreed commending Jodie's honesty and openness.

'I wish more Cafe's, Restaurants, and places in general took this stance in regards to unruly children and ignorant parents. Good on you! I will be sure to pop in for a coffee next time i'm in that way.'

However not all the responses were positive, with young dad Josh Hardes commented saying he would not tolerate being asked to leave if his child was behaving badly.

'I have a 10 month old son and quite often enjoy going to cafes and restaurants with him and my wife.

My son may occasionally cry. Or be loud with his toys, but i do not tolerate someone telling me to leave, to keep him quiet, or try moving me to another area.

'I'm there paying for a meal, not your opinion or to be judged by you or your staff. Some kids may be sick, may be having an off day, it may be their first time out in a situation like this so they will be excitable, give the parents the benefit of doubt.

'Or you may just upset the wrong parent one day and the outcome may not be as expected,' Josh wrote.
