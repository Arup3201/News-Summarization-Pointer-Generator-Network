Couple: Becky Tait, 20, stepped in front of a train on the same stretch of tracks where her boyfriend Phil James, 19, did the same two months earlier

A heartbroken girlfriend killed herself at the same spot where her boyfriend committed suicide weeks earlier after struggling to come to terms with his death, an inquest heard today.

Becky Tait, 20, stepped in front of a speeding train on the same tracks where her boyfriend Phil James, 19, had stood two months earlier.

The care assistant from Stoke-on-Trent had been distraught after his death and was struggling to cope with her loss, Cannock Coroner’s Court in Staffordshire was told.

Miss Tait went to the tracks where she died last November - where her ‘soul mate’ Mr James had died in September.

Witnesses said she looked on ‘purposefully’ at the passenger train, which braked but struck her - causing multiple injuries. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

Miss Tait had already tried to kill herself a month after Mr James’s death by taking an overdose, the inquest was told.

She was kept in hospital for five days where she told mental health nurses she was unable to cope with the death of her boyfriend.

Miss Tait was discharged in October and put into the care of her grandparents, but she killed herself one month later. Margaret Jones, deputy assistant coroner for Staffordshire South, recorded a verdict of suicide.

She said: ‘Becky Tait was a very young lady who was clearly traumatised by the death of her boyfriend. She was a very unhappy lady.

‘She clearly had been since the death of her boyfriend some weeks ago in similar circumstances. She had made some progress since being discharged from hospital.'

She said that on the 9th of November she was went to the railway tracks and was seen by witnesses. 

She added: 'This was a tragic event and her death deeply affected a lot of her family and friends.’

A young witness, who cannot be named, said in a statement read out to the court: ‘This girl was hanging over the barriers and I just thought she was in a rush or something.

‘I could see that she squeezed through the barriers and onto the train lines. I thought she was in a rush and she was just going to walk through the train lines.

‘The train came closer and closer, but she stood in the middle of the tracks. She waited for the train to get too close and then it hit her.’

Police Constable Melanie Dodd, of British Transport Police, told the inquest that Miss Tait had a suitcase at the time, which contained clothes and personal items.

She added: ‘She moved on the tracks in front of the train, indicating a deliberate act. I am aware that her boyfriend did something similar weeks before.’

Flowers left at the scene of the double-tragedy in Staffordshire

Miss Tait, who was born in Darlington, County Durham, had been going out with Mr James for a number of months and had planned a holiday to Portugal.

Mr James was described as a huge fan of Robbie Williams and had a tattoo of the pop star’s name across his chest.

The Stoke-born singer even took to his personal blog to pay tribute to Mr James, saying: ‘Save me a pint in heaven youth. Gone too soon. We'll all miss you. Much love, Rob.’

Consultant clinical psychologist Jurai Daromgkamas said Miss Tait was treated by the crisis team at South Staffordshire and Shropshire NHS Trust.

She added: ‘The plan was to keep her safe and well until she was no longer feeling the suicide feelings. She was given some suggestions for coping strategies and was also told she was going to be monitored in the community.

‘She said she no longer had suicide thoughts and hence she was discharged from the ward.’

Later, Miss Tait’s grandmother Val James said she was in Spain at the time of the death - and had received a text from the care worker just before she took her own life.

She said: ‘The text said she can't cope anymore and that it would be okay and that she loved me. She was such a beautiful and fantastic girl. She was our world. We have done so much to remember her the way she was.’

Her friend Jade Johnson, 21, added: ‘She was usually the life of the party. She was the sort of person who would make sure people were enjoying themselves.

Another friend, Debra Blythe, 50, said: ‘She was such a lovely person and she had so many friends. She would do anything to cheer people up, including a funny dance. That's just who she was.’
