The retired Marine Corps general at the forefront of the U.S.-led coalition in the fight against ISIS told ABC News in an exclusive interview that the terror group 'is at an entirely different level than al Qaeda was.'

ISIS is 'better organized than al Qaeda. It's command and control is better,' John Allen, the Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS, told ABC.

When asked whether ISIS is a threat to the home front, Allen said 'we should take it very seriously.'

After ISIS appeared to burn Jordanian pilot Lt. Muath al-Kasasbeh alive in a new video, Allen said the country was helping the U.S. against ISIS more than ever.

Coalition forces are going up against what General Allen believes is a more formidable enemy than even al Qaeda.

Allen says that ISIS has adapted in a way that they are harder to find.

'You don't see the long convoys now with flags flying in broad daylight. But we have also adapted our targeting process, as well.'

Allen said the video released last week showing the Islamic State burning a Jordanian pilot alive 'absolutely' backfired on the group, as Jordan's King Abdullah II has vowed to fight back. 

'It's galvanized the coalition, united the coalition,' Allen said.

General Allen acknowledges this is a generational fight but that despite setbacks, ISIS as an enemy is not going away.

Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, delivered a grim assessment of the group's evolution in testimony to the House Armed Services Committee. He described how the group was surfacing in North Africa.

'With affiliates in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, the group is beginning to assemble a growing international footprint that includes ungoverned and under governed areas,' Stewart testified.

Defense secretary nominee Ashton Carter, who had his confirmation hearing Wednesday, also told Congress this past week he is aware of reports that ISIS may try to expand into Afghanistan.

Allen got some support for his argument from Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Judeh.

Judeh told ABC later in the show that ISIS is 'on the run,' but that certain victory 'will not be quick.'

'They are not gone yet,' he said. 'The air campaign has degraded their capabilities on the ground. They still control territories. They still have access to Syria's cash and funds and sophisticated weaponry… . But there is no doubt we shall prevail.'

Allen and Judeh's positive analysis was preceded Sunday by Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the former director of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, who says the United States' overarching strategy for combating Islamic extremist groups is not working.

'The counterterrorism component works just fine to go after the high-value targets and key leaders,' he told 'Fox News Sunday.' 'But we need a much broader strategy that recognizes that we're facing not just this tactical problem of ISIS in Iraq and Syria. … I think what I'm saying is the strategy that we have is not working, and it's clearly not working.'

He estimated the size of the enemy has doubled in the past 10 years and pointed to such hotspots as middle-central Asia, northern Africa and sub-Saharan Africa.
