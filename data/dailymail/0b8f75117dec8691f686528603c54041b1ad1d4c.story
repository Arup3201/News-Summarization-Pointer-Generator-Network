Pictured below is the 'bear selfie' craze - a trend so reckless officials have issued a safety warning pleading for it to stop.

Increasingly high numbers of visitors to South Lake Tahoe, California, are putting themselves at risk of an attack or mauling in order to get a share-able snap of themselves with a bear in the background.

The worrying trend of tourists squeezing into shots of wild bears has now become so commonplace officials in Sierra Nevada have issued a public safety warning to try it.

The U.S. Forest Service at Taylor Creek Visitor Center in South Lake Tahoe say visitors are risking their lives in the hunt for a unique profile picture by approaching the bears.

‘We've had mobs of people that are actually rushing toward the bears trying to get a “selfie” photo,’ Lisa Herron, spokesperson for the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit told Reno Gazette-Journal.

‘We are telling people they need to stay on the trails and they need to stay away from the bears.

‘If a bear has a mind to it can run very fast.’

Although bear attacks are rare, the risk of one taking place unsurprisingly increases if the animals are provoked by the presence of humans. In particular, female bears with cubs will charge if they perceive a threat on their cubs.

However, for the tourists at Taylor Creek, where the annual kokanee salmon ruin attracts many hungry bears, it seems nothing is too much for a risk for the right Instagram brag.

A recent visitor at the site said she saw dozens of people taking selfies with the bears, who were unafraid of the group.

‘There were like 30 people taking pictures of themselves with the bears,’ Manutsawee Buapet told ABC News.

‘They weren’t scared at all of the people and one bear cub came as close as two feet to the tourists.’
