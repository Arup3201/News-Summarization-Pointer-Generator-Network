Anyone with a sneaking feeling that London living is not all that it's cracked up to be might want to consider a rather more spacious alternative to living in a cramped city centre apartment.

Isola di Mal Ventre is one of the few remaining private islands available for sale in the Mediterranean, and will set you back just under £1.2million - cheaper than a semi-detached property in some areas of the capital.

Barely 130 miles from the fashionable resort of Porto Cervo where even the most modest of villas could set you back over £10 million, the island is located just a few miles off the coast of Sardinia and is completely uninhabited, with only the remains of a shepherd dwelling visible.

Blue paradise? The Isola di Mal Ventre is one of the few private islands for sale in the Mediterranean

Tranquillity: The island has crystal clear waters and numerous coves composing spheres of pure quartz

Proof if any were needed that you don't have to be Richard Branson to own an island, the 200 acre island on sale is around two kilometres long at its longest point and rises around 18 metres above sea level.

The agents selling the piece of land known as Isola di Mal Ventre, or roughly translated as 'the Island of the Sore Belly' has been inhabited on and off since Roman times with a watering well and buildings foundations still evident. 

These could be incorporated in the design of a modern villa and the agency selling it says it may be possible to construct a jetty from which trips to the mainland could be done in minutes by boat.

Located within a marine protected area, the island's current owners took it on in 1972

As far as the eye can see: The island's south east coast has some beautiful sandy beaches

The west coast of the island is quite exposed to the Mistral and is rugged as a result, whereas the south east coast has beautiful sandy beaches with crystal blue waters and numerous coves composing spheres of pure quartz.

The island itself is mainly granite covered in low vegetation with a wide variety of flora and fauna.

Situated within a marine protected area, the island has not been the subject of any planning application since its current owners took it on in 1972. 

It's cheaper than this.... the 'ice cube house' in Brixton, on the market for £1.5m

And this...David Cameron's former home in West London was valued at £1.5million recently

Local architects suggest that a low rise villa could easily be constructed around the remains of former buildings, while water could be drawn from the existing well. 

'This is one of the most unique properties in the Mediterranean, with potential revenue from holiday makers looking for sanctuary or something a little different,' said spokesperson Alexandra Hayward of the sale, which is advertised on real estate website debutesq.

Direct flights flights to Sardinia are available from London and many other major European cities
