US authorities searched luggage and pulled passengers off a plane in New York after a bag sparked a security scare because it had a logo that is similar to ISIS insignia.

Stunned passengers pulled out their cameras or mobile phones to film the unsettling moment when law enforcement personnel boarded the Sun Country Airlines aircraft on the tarmac at JFK International Airport on Thursday.

Travellers said local and federal officers went through luggage with a bomb-sniffing dog and detained around ten people before the flight was allowed to leave for Minneapolis around 90 minutes behind schedule.

Security scare: Authorities searched luggage with a bomb-sniffing dog and removed around ten passengers

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said the search occurred after someone noticed a logo that was similar to the insignia of the terror group ISIS.

It turns out the logo belongs to a travel agency that had given the bags to a tourist group, KARE 11 reported.

A federal source told WNBC that a passenger on the plane had a duffel bag that had the word 'ISIS' on it. 

Passenger Nathan Tylutki, of St Paul, Minnesota, filmed part of the incident and told the TV station he became concerned when he saw authorities questioning a specific group of travellers.

He said: ‘For me, there seemed to be some profiling going on. They say "a word on luggage", and I am getting this second-hand.

'I didn’t see luggage but there did seem to be some profiling going on because the people detained were wearing hijabs and clothing you see in the Middle East.’

Nothing was found during the search and the passengers were allowed to continue their journey.

Port Authority spokesman Joe Pentangelo said the passengers who were removed from the plane were questioned by police and FBI agents, KARE 11 reported.

He confirmed they booked their trip through an agency who provided bags with a logo that is similar to ISIS’ logo.

A Transportation Security Administration spokesperson said: ‘Upon landing at JFK, the flight crew requested that the airplane be screened for explosives. An explosive detection canine cleared the aircraft for continued operation.’
