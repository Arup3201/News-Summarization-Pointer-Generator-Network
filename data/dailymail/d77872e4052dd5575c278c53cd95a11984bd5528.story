It has been claimed that Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis had a long-running personal vendetta against Channel 7 and in particular their Sunrise program.

Monis spent six years lobbying the Australian media watchdog over what he perceived were breaches of broadcasting regulations involving Sunrise news segments. The hostage-taker died along with two of the 17 hostages he took in the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place just metres from Channel 7's Sunrise studio last week.

The attack took place so near 7's offices it prompted speculation the Sunrise studio was his target from the very beginning, but that his initial plans went awry. Fairfax revealed that the 50-year-old first complained in mid-2007 to the ACMA about a Sunrise program broadcast on July 4 of that year.

Monis' dispute with the ACMA and Seven back then apparently was not triggered by 7's current affairs expose of his anti-Afghan soldier letter-writing campaign and online videos in 2008, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Rather his perceived hatred for the channel and Sunrise was that he alleged a guest on the program had commented about the Glasgow terror attacks and had indirectly provided instructions for terrorism and had therefore breached terrorism laws.

Over the next six years he was obsessed with Sunrise and the area it was located in. During this time correspondence associated with the dispute about Seven and the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) that Monis sent to other authorities, contain numerous references to ‘Martin Place’ and ‘acts of terrorism’.

For years afterwards Monis made reference to the Sunrise program. Throughout 2012, he maintained a website on which he posted just one statement which said: ‘That from 2001 I was silent, I was dead.

‘Until 4th July 2007 I was in a deep sleep. Sunrise woke me up! God can awaken a person by many different means even by a terrorist broadcast from the program Sunrise on Channel Seven from the Australian TV!

I thank God and I won't give up until the Australian government condemns that broadcast which was instructing terrorism.’

Monis sent numerous ranting letters to authorities complaining about Sunrise's coverage

In later ranting letters to other authorities about the Channel 7 program he bemoaned the failure’ of it to investigate ‘terrorist acts at Martin Place, Sydney, Australia’.

A spokesman for Channel 7 said the station was making no comment on Monis while the siege investigation was ongoing.

Sunrise in its current format began in 2002. It’s presented by David Koch and Samantha Armytage and follows Seven Early News. Runing from 6am to 9am, it’s followed by The Morning Show.

Like most breakfast shows it delivers segments on news, views, entertainment and humour.
