A mortar attack on a beach near Donetsk has left children running for their lives as fighting in the pro-Russian rebel stronghold intensifies following the MH17 disaster.

The attack took place in the village of Avdiivka, about 15 miles north of the city, and saw the missile crash into a lake - narrowly missing families as they swam and sunbathed in the area.

Pro-Kiev troops have been blamed for the attack and it is understood they have since taken control of the village from rebels as part of a wider attempt to wrestle back possession of Donetsk itself.

Fear: The amateur footage show a mortar missile landing in the water at a lake near Avdiivka. Families swimming and sunbathing in the area were forced to flee the scene in panic

Panic: The mortar attack at the lake-side beach in Avdiivka was captured on amateur video and saw a terrified family, including young children, dashing for the relative safety of their car

The mortar attack at the lake-side beach in Avdiivka was captured on amateur video and saw a terrified family, including young children, dashing for the relative safety of their car.

The person taking the footage - which appears to have been filmed on either a mobile phone or a headset-mounted camera - is then seen fumbling with his car keys and shouting panicked instructions at his children in Russian while they cower behind the vehicle.

The incident has been blamed on pro-Kiev forces who are understood to have forced rebels out of several village in the suburbs north of Donetsk as part of a wider attempt to retake the city itself.

The Ukrainian government has denied sending its army in the area and says the villages were retaken by forces loyal to Kiev, but not under their control. 

The area in and around Donetsk is particularly tense following the death of 298 passengers on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 last week .

Yesterday fighting broke out near the railway station in Donetsk in what separatists said was an attempt by government forces to seize back the east Ukrainian city.

The government in Kiev denied sending the regular army into the centre of Donetsk, which the separatists captured in April, but said small 'self-organised' pro-Ukrainian groups were fighting the pro-Russian rebels in the city.

Four people were killed in clashes near the railway station and close to the airport outside Donetsk, local health officials said in the industrial city which was home to about one million people before many fled the fighting in the region.

Five days after a Malaysian airliner was brought down about 60 km (37 miles) away, rebels are jumpy in Donetsk, one of two cities they still hold after being ousted from several towns by the government forces this month.

When a rebel leader reported shooting at the railway station, dozens jumped into minibuses to join the fray and artillery fire sent plumes of smoke skywards.

But almost as quickly as the shelling started, it eased, leaving a control tower at the railway station with shattered windows.

By early afternoon, local authorities 
said the trains were running normally and the station had been only 
slightly damaged, but a Reuters witness could still hear shelling.

An electricity substation was partially destroyed and people with suitcases were leaving the area.

'It is dangerous near the railway station!' the Donetsk city council said in a statement on its website after the shooting began, asking residents in the area to stay indoors.

It said a nine-storey house had been damaged in the shelling and that transport had been halted in the area.

'In the morning there were explosions, people are extremely worried,' said a local resident who gave her name as Natalya.

Shelter: The incident has been blamed on pro-Kiev forces who are understood to have forced rebels out of several village in the suburbs north of Donetsk as part of a wider attempt to retake the city itself

Escape: The camera pans out across the lake, where smoke from the missile can still be seen in the air

Donetsk is central to the rebel uprising against rule by Kiev, and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has vowed to retake the city as part of what Kiev calls its 'anti-terrorist operation' against the separatists.

He has, however, instructed the army not to fight within a 40 km (25 mile) diameter of the site where Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 came down on Thursday, killing all 298 people on board. But that does not cover Donetsk.

A statement from the headquarters of the 'anti-terrorist operation' said the army had taken control over a suburb of Donetsk and the president said soldiers were 'freeing' the village of Dzerzhinsk, about 60 km north of Donetsk.

Tense: Pro-Russia separatists stand at a checkpoint near in the northern outskirts of Donetsk today. Terrified civilians fled as intense clashes between pro-Kiev troops and rebels left at least four people dead yesterday

Security Council spokesman Andriy 
Lysenko said work was under way around Donetsk on 'clearing approaches 
to the city, on destroying checkpoints of the terrorists.'

'If there are explosions in the middle of the city - then it is not Ukrainian soldiers,' he told a news conference.

'We have strict orders not to use air 
strikes and artillery in the city. If there is fighting in the city, we 
have information that there is a small self-organised group who are 
fighting with the terrorists,' Lysenko added.

The pro-Western authorities in Kiev accuse the rebel fighters of shooting down the airliner. The separatists deny they are to blame.
