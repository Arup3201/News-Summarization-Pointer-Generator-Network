The Malaysia Airlines website has been hacked by group calling themselves the 'Lizard Squad' leaving a message saying '404 Plane Not Found' and declaring it part of their 'cyber caliphate'

Users logging on to the site of Malaysia's national carrier earlier today were greeted with the picture of a lizard in a top hat, monocle and tuxedo, smoking a pipe.

The image was surrounded by the message '404 Plane Not Found', an apparent reference to the airlines' unexplained loss of flight MH370 last year with 239 people aboard.

The picture, which greeted people logging on to the Malaysia Airlines website earlier today after it was hacked by a group calling themselves the Lizard Squad 

The site also showed the message, 'Hacked by Lizard Squad - Official Cyber Caliphate', while a rap song played in the background.

Some people also reported that the hacked site carried the words 'ISIS will prevail'.

In a statement, Malaysia Airlines confirmed its Internet domain had been compromised and that they were redirecting users.

The statement said: 'At this stage, Malaysia Airlines' web servers are intact,' but added it could take nearly 24 hours to fully resolve the issue, which it had reported to Malaysian authorities.

They added: 'Malaysia Airlines assures customers and clients that its website was not hacked and this temporary glitch does not affect their bookings and that user data remains secured.'

It was not clear why the troubled airline was targeted but the hacking group said on its Twitter feed that it was 'Going to dump some loot found on malaysiaairlines.com servers soon.' 

They also tweeted claiming that Malaysia Airlines was lying about user data not being compromised. 

The Lizard Squad is a group of hackers that has caused havoc in the online world before, taking credit for attacks that took down the Sony PlayStation Network and Microsoft's Xbox Live network last month.

In August, it also tweeted to American Airlines that there might be explosives on a plane carrying the president of Sony Online Entertainment, which makes video games, forcing the flight to be diverted.

The extent of any links with the Islamic State, however, are not yet known.

How the Malaysia Airlines website usually looks. The carrier has since released a statement saying that user data has remained secure

The jihadist group has seized large swathes of Syria and Iraq in a brutal campaign and declared an independent Islamic 'caliphate'.

It also has used social media to recruit and spread its message. 

The group has prompted world revulsion with its video-taped executions of journalists and other foreigners.

On Sunday, it claimed to have beheaded a Japanese security contractor. A second Japanese captive has also been threatened with execution.

Concerns over ISIS have spiked in Malaysia after scores of its citizens were lured to the Syrian jihad.

Malaysian authorities last week said they have detained 120 people suspected of having ISIS sympathies or planning to travel to Syria.

The unexplained loss of MH370 and the airlines' poor crisis-handling in the aftermath of the disappearance severely damaged public confidence in the carrier, sending the business into a tailspin.

In July, flight MH17 was also shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 passengers and crew.

The airline has since been taken over by a Malaysian government investment fund.
