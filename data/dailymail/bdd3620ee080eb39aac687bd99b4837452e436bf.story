In the last clash of the swimming titans in London, Michael Phelps showed why he's the greatest Olympian of all time as he boosted his medal count to 20 in his final race against rival Ryan Lochte.

The 27-year-old Phelps picked up gold in the 200m individual medley, as Lochte, his friend and closest rival came in right behind him.

The Olympic swimming sensation has made no secret about the fact that he plans to retire after the London games.

The win - his first individual gold medal in London - was a historic trifecta for Phelps, who is now the only male athlete to win the same event in three-straight Olympics.

He led the field from beginning to end, and touched the wall first in a time of one minute, 54.27 seconds, just outside Lochte's world record of 1:54.00 that he set last year in the final at the Shanghai world championships.

Lochte, close to exhaustion after winning bronze in the 200 backstroke, held on to finish second, just 0.63 behind his teammate.

Phelps had only kind words for his compatriot.

'Ryan has probably been one of the toughest competitors I've swam against, all-around competitors,' Phelps said of Lochte. 'We're seeing a lot more competitors coming up.'

Posting on Twitter after the dramatic swim, Lochte said: 'Hell of a race with @TylerClary and @MichaelPhelps.'

The race also pushed the American medal count up to 37, three above China in overall Olympic hardware.

Rumours swirled today that Phelps may be heading to a career in television after the London games.

Though Phelps hasn't divulged post-retirement plans, America's top TV networks are reportedly falling over themselves hoping to land Teams USA's golden boy as a sports commentator.

TMZ reports that NBC, ESPN and ABC are preparing to capture Phelps as a future Olympics commentator with huge contracts that could be worth millions - in a possible bidding war.

While the networks try to woo Phelps 
with dollar signs, there was only one thing on the swimming champ's 
mind: His final race today with rival Lochte.

Their
 first showdown of the London Olympics went to Lochte in a runaway on 
the opening night of the swimming competition. This one was much closer.

'We love racing against each other,' Phelps said before the race. 'Neither one of us likes to lose. I like to say we bring out the best in one another.'

Hungary's Laszlo Cseh, who touched the wall after Lochte and picking up the bronze medal in a time of 1:56.22.

Cseh been the perennial also-ran in the last two Olympics, taking bronze behind Phelps at the 2004 Athens Games and silver four years ago in Beijing when Phelps won and Lochte was third.

Lochte had a busy schedule on another
 big day for American swimmers, winning a bronze medal in the 200m 
backstroke final - about a half hour before the 'duel in the pool' 
against Phelps. 

Though friends, the two have sparked a rivalry in the water, with many Americans split on who to root for.

But Phelps appeared to have one backer that Lochte does not - the leader of the free world.

Phelps, still reeling from the previous day's tweet, described the call as 'pretty cool'.

'I answered the phone and the voice said "Michael?" "Yes." "Please hold for the President of the United States,"' he told reporters today, after qualifying for the 100-meter butterfly semi-final.

'I was like, "wow."'

The president, he said, told Phelps the country was supporting him and proud of his performance.

The conversation took an awkward turn when the president said: 'Make sure you tell your mom I said hi'.'

Phelps' mother Debbie, who raised Phelps and his two sisters single-handedly, is considered to be a great contributor to his success, helping him with his hyperactivity, and egging him on from the stands at every meet.

The final Phelps-Lochte contest was the main event in another huge day for American swimmers.

Rebecca Soni won gold in the women’s 200m breast stroke final, shattering a world record. 

She clocked in at 2:19.59, breaking her own mark of 2:20.00 that she set in the semifinals.

Soni said: 'I'm so happy. I can't believe I did it.'

Jubilation: Tyler Clary won gold and set a new Olympic record with his performance in the men's 200m backstroke

Tyler Clary won gold and set a new Olympic record with his performance in the men's 200m backstroke.

After the race, he was in disbelief, saying: 'The fact that it just came to fruition is something that hasn't even processed in my mind yet.

'The fact that I'm now an Olympic champion and Olympic-record holder is something that is very humbling. It's also very motivating for the next four years.'

Yesterday, Nathan Adrian won the 100m freestyle and the team of Missy Franklin, Dana Vollmer, Shannon Vreeland and Allison Schmitt in the 4x200 free relay on Wednesday.

Adrian won a thrilling race that came down to the end. He got to the wall one-hundredth of a second ahead of James 'The Missile' Magnussen of Australia, becoming the first American to win the 100 free since Matt Biondi at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
