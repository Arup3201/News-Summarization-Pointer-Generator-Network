Women are big fans of the latest fitness fads to help us stay in shape, and now a new video has captured exercise trends from the an entire century in just 100 seconds. 

The YouTube film, starring an energetic professional dancer, showcases fitness fads and movements from the 1910s to the current day.

And the clip has already attracted almost 12,000 views since its launch five days ago.

Created by Benenden wellbeing services, the video is intended to shed light on the changeable nature of women's exercise. 

The UK fitness industry is worth £4 billion and growing, with a record 13.2 per cent of the population belonging to gyms, but the landscape of female fitness has dramatically changed from 100 years ago.

A new YouTube video showcases fitness fads and movements from the 1910s to the current day, starting with the gentle stretches of the 1910s which were used to improve the hips and even ease constipation

Ten years on and women had moved on to more dynamic stretches, often while wearing silk night gowns 

The Women's League of Health and Beauty aimed to bring fitness to the masses in the 1930s

Travelling through time, decade by decade, 100 Years of Fitness begins with a look at the gentle stretch exercises favoured in the 1910s and 1920s: a time when perspiration was seen as 'unfeminine.' 

The hula hoop and twister fads of the mid-20th century are also featured. The video ends with the biggest fitness movement of the millennium, Zumba.

The 1940s saw an early form of sit-up as a 'sweat reducing' excercise 

The hula hoop was an almighty craze in the mid century but also provided a form of exercise 

The Trim Twist was an exercise board popular among Sixties housewives and office workers 

Jazzercise was introduced to Seventies fitness fans by former Broadway star Judi Sheppard Missett

A spokesman for Benenden, says that we often unaware of how long the notion of keeping fit has been around: 'Keeping fit didn't begin with Lycra and aerobics classes. Both sexes have been keeping themselves in shape in different ways for centuries, so this showcase of the past 100 years is Benenden's own tribute to the passage of time.' 

Eighties-style aerobics is a high energy cardiovascular exercise that is still popular today

Tae Bo combined taekwondo and boxing and was popular ahead of the millennium 

Fitness through dance returned in the form of Street Dance in 2000s

Zumba has remained a favourite over the past five years for its fun approach to fitness

1910s: Women's main form of exercise was comprised of gentle stretches that were said to improve the hips and, believe it or not, ease constipation!

1920s: Fitness costumes included silk nightgowns.

1930s: The genteel Women's League of Health and Beauty aimed to bring fitness to the masses. Its motto: 'Movement Is Life.' Members attended group classes and wore black shorts and white satin vests.

1940s: Sweat-reducing exercises were the order of the day, including an early form of sit-up.

1950s: The hula hoop took centre stage, promoted as an exercise tool! Who knew you could have so much fun while burning calories?

1960s: The Trim Twist, a square of pressed board on top of a metal turning mechanism, was a hit with housewives and office workers alike.

1970s: Former Broadway star, Judi Sheppard Missett, introduced Jazzercise! This combination of aerobic exercise and jazz dancing was designed to slim and tone, and is still practised in 32 countries today.

1980s: Day-glo leotards and big hair dominated. High-energy aerobic routines and high kicks provided an intense cardiovascular workout.

1990s: Billy Blanks, an American taekwondo instructor, brought Tae Bo to the nation. His exercise trend combined taekwondo and boxing.

2000s: The decade in which fitness through dance returned. 'Street dance' passed through school yards and local neighbourhoods into dance studios and gyms.

2010s: Fitness is more fast-paced than ever. Zumba incorporates elements of hip-hop, soca, salsa, samba, merengue and mambo. It feels more like a trip to a nightclub with friends than an effort to get fit.
