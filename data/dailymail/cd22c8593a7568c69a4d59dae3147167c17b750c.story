The immaculate appearance of Kate and Pippa Middleton while they were schoolgirls was 'galling' to other families who felt 'hopeless' by comparison, according to the mother of one of their schoolmates.

The Duchess of Cambridge and her younger sister attended Marlborough College, a £31,350 per annum boarding school in Wiltshire, along with their brother James, and the anonymous mother's daughter was in the same house as the girls.

Speaking to Tatler, the parent said: 'There was always something slightly galling about having your child at school with the Middletons. It made other families feel rather hopeless.'

According to the mother, Carole Middleton always ensured her children - Kate, 31, Pippa, 29, and James, 26 - were perfectly turned-out, that their tennis racquets were the smartest, and that they threw the best picnics on school sports days.

She added that every item of the Middleton children's clothing came equipped with a 'beautifully sewn-in name tape... it was unthinkable that they would resort to a marker pen on labels'.
