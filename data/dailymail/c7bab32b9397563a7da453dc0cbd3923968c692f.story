Less than a month after their horsing around in Memphis, Princes William and Harry are at it again - but they had to be on their best behaviour.

Their real grandmother may not have been among the packed crowd at a charity polo match today, but her screen counterpart Dame Helen Mirren was there to watch.

The celebrated actress shared a joke with the princely pair as the Duke of Cambridge - fresh from a good luck visit to the England football team's locker room - teamed up with his newly-single brother for the match in Ascot, Berkshire.

But there was disappointment for the 
celebrities, who also included the actress Anna Friel, comedy star Nick 
Frost and explorer Ben Fogle - as the princes' team lost the 
nail-biting clash 5-4 in the last few minutes.

A gift? For me? Fresh from paying a good luck visit to the England football team, Prince William met his screen grandmother Dame Helen Mirren at a charity polo match

Sharing a joke: Dame Helen and Prince Harry wore broad smiles as they were accompanied by her husband, director of An Officer and a Gentleman Taylor Hackford

Charity: The annual event was in aid of three charities in which the princes hold senior roles and has raised more than Â£1.5million over the last 10 years

Horsing around: Princes William and Harry teamed up for a charity polo match in Ascot, Berkshire, in one of their first appearances together since Guy Pelly's wedding

Sporting: The princes' team lost 5-4 in the nail-biting last few minutes of the match. The day was in aid of three charities close to their hearts, including the Royal Marsden

In action: The invitation-only event featured around 300 people including film and TV actresses. Pictured, Prince Harry playing for the Audi Quattro team today

Brotherly day out: While their grandmother famously declines to wear a helmet when she is out riding, the faster-moving princes were more cautious

Horsing around: Prince Harry in full gear at the match today. He founded the Sentebale charity in Lesotho, which has the third-highest HIV infection rate in the world

Team sport: The polo match went on for an hour and was watched by an invitation-only crowd of more than 300 people. The princes' team lost at the last moment

The pair were playing today in the annual Audi Polo Challenge at the Coworth Park club in Ascot, Berkshire.

A
 two-day event, it was expected to raise tens of thousands of pounds for
 three charities close to the princes' hearts: the Royal Marsden cancer 
hospital in Chelsea, London, the youth training charity Skillforce and 
the HIV fund Sentebale.

Prince
 William is the president of the Royal Marsden and the Royal patron of 
Skillforce, while Harry founded Sentebale with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho.

The
 African nation has the third-highest HIV infection rate in the world - a
 third of its children are orphans and more than 37,000 children under 
14 are living with the disease.

So
 the princes' appearance was no surprise - and last year, it was the 
Duke's first public day out after the birth of Prince George.

The princes' appearance was no surprise. Last year it was the Duke's first public day out after the birth of Prince George, and he was rewarded with a baby mallet

Saddling up: The match is played every year and went on for around an hour, with the event expected to raise tens of thousands of pounds for charity

Coming home: It was a nail-biting finish for the princes, whose team lost 5-4 in the last few minutes of the match at the Coworth Park club in Ascot, Berkshire

Elite: The Princes met the invitation-only crowd, including their on-screen grandmother alongside Anna Friel, Nick Frost, Ben Fogle and Will Young

To mark the occasion last year, Audi's British director Martin Sander presented him with a baby polo mallet.

But
 while last year William's Audi Quattro team won a respectable 8-7 
against competitors Audi Ultra, this year the Royal team lost the 
hour-long match in the last few minutes.

The
 loss would have been particularly galling considering the unusual prize
 - some silver wine coolers in the shape of polo helmets.

The invitation-only event featured 300 people from the worlds of film, television, pop and journalism.

The
 queen may not have been there, but her most celebrated impersonator 
Dame Helen Mirren was, along with her husband Taylor Hackford, who 
directed An Officer and a Gentleman.

Other
 guests included the TV star Anna Friel, who appeared in the 2011 
Hollywood blockbuster Limitless and The Look of Love, a biopic of 
British top-shelf magazine owner Paul Raymond.

Also on the bill was Nick Frost, co-star with Simon Pegg in the hit Brit comedies Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead and Paul.

Pop singer Will Young joined radio 
presenter Nick Ferrari, while Life on Mars actor Dean Andrews appeared 
with his partner Helen Bowen-Green and TV presenter Zoe Hardman.

Among
 them were also W1A and Mr Sloane actress Ophelia Lovibond, Eastenders 
and Pramface star Emer Kenny and Channel 4 presenter Rick Edwards.

And
 they would need no tips on grace and poise, as Strictly Come Dancing's 
ballroom expert Brendan Cole was also among the guests.

It was one of the princes' first appearances together since attending friend Guy Pelly's wedding in Memphis earlier this month.

Guests
 said 29-year-old Harry was seen twerking on the dancefloor - though the
 brothers were a little more sedate during the day, paying homage to 
king of rock'n'roll Elvis Presley with a private tour of Graceland.
