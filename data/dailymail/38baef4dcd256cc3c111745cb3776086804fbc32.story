Two runaway teenage lovers who fled their £30,000-a-year public school  and flew to the Caribbean have finally been tracked down a week after going on the run.

Edward Bunyan and Indira Gainiyeva have been found 'safe and well' in the Dominican Republic and will now be taken home to Britain, Lancashire Police said today.

Detectives would not confirm the hotel they were staying in, but until yesterday they had been in the all-inclusive five-star Occidental hotel in Punta Cana, on the eastern edge of the island.

Having been spotted yesterday they fled again, but were tracked to a different hotel and it is believed Edward's mother is now with them.

Hunt is over: Edward Bunyan and Indira Gainiyeva, both pupils of Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, were traced to the Occidental Hotel, pictured, having fled to the Dominican Republic last week

Edward, 16, and Indira, who turned 17 last week, used their credit cards at the luxury resort, local police said.

The pair, who are said to have been dating for several months, sneaked out of the prestigious Stonyhurst College last Monday and jetted to the Dominican Republic, after telling friends they were sick of the rainy weather.

The school has refused to be drawn on whether the pair will be suspended or expelled.

Their vanishing act created an international media sensation, and pupils at the mixed-sex boarding school in Clitheroe, Lancashire, have nicknamed them Bonnie and Clyde.

But Lancashire Police said today the hunt for them was over.

'The students have thankfully been located safe and well at a hotel in the Punta Cana area of the Dominican Republic,' a spokesman said.

Plans are now being made for their safe return to the UK. They will be given a welfare debrief by police following their arrival back in this country.

'Our priority throughout this has been to ensure the safety and welfare of these students and after they have been spoken to on their return this will signal an end of police involvement in this matter.'

Runaways: Edward, 16, and Indira, who turned 17 last week have been nicknamed Bonnie and Clyde following their disappearing act.

Stonyhurst head Andrew Johnson said he was 'absolutely delighted' they were found.

He said there will be discussions with them and their families when they return but it was too early to speculate about their future.

In a statement he said: 'We are absolutely delighted to be able to report that the two missing pupils have been found safe and well by police in the Dominican Republic.

'They are currently in the care of the police and a family member.

'Staff and pupils at the College have been concerned in recent days for the safety of the two.

'We are really most grateful to parents and friends of Stonyhurst for their overwhelming support at this difficult time, and for their prayers for the safety of the two young people.

'Over the coming days we will be having discussions with the two young people and their families about what has happened and also what happens next.

'However, it is simply too early at the moment to speculate about the future.'

Edward – an experienced international 
traveller who previously attended schools in Spain and Canada – is  the 
Cheltenham-born son of a civil engineer, while Indira’s family are from 
oil-rich Kazakhstan.

The 
800-room Occidental hotel is used by British tour operator Thomson and described as
 a ‘Spanish-style all inclusive resort with impressive facilities, 
nestled on a beautiful beachfront with coconut palms dotted on the 
shoreline’.

It boasts three lagoon-style swimming 
pools, a spa, gym, tennis courts, nine themed restaurants, scuba diving 
facilities, seven bars and live nightly shows. The resort is about seven
 hours by car from the resort of Puerto Plata, which the pair were 
believed to have flown into.

A seven-night Thomson package holiday at the hotel costs £1,672 per person.

Indira appeared to have logged on to the Russian equivalent of Facebook yesterday, suggesting the pair are active online and may be aware of the police hunt and the media attention surrounding their disappearance.

Her parents had yesterday pleaded for her to send a text ‘or anything’ to show she is safe.

Staff at the £30,000-a-year Stonyhurst College in Clitheroe, Lancashire, realised they were missing only when they failed to turn up for school register

Indira’s father Ravil Gainiyev, a wealthy Kazakh businessman, said he had not heard from her since she left school at 3am and caught a taxi to Manchester Airport with her boyfriend.

He said: ‘I called her and sent her messages but she did not answer.’

Mr Gainiyev, 50, said he did not want to cancel her credit card because he was afraid it could mean she and Edward would be ‘forced to be tramps’.

Indira’s 46-year-old mother Firuza said from her home in Kyzylorda, southern Kazakhstan: ‘I beg and pray she is in good health. She knows that she and our other children mean  more than anything for myself and my husband.’
