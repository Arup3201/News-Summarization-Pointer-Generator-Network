The feuding in Labour’s high command intensified last night after Harriet Harman and Ed Balls were caught plotting against Ed Miliband’s embattled elections chief.

Party deputy Ms Harman and the Shadow Chancellor discussed criticism of Douglas Alexander in a close huddle outside Mr Balls’s Commons office on Wednesday.

According to a reliable eyewitness, Ms Harman said to Mr Balls: ‘The trouble with Douglas is that he just isn’t engaged at the moment.’ Mr Balls reportedly nodded in reply.

Feud: The feuding in the Labour party has intensified after Harman and Balls were caught plotting

Asked last night whether Ms Harman had called Mr Alexander ‘not engaged’, her spokeswoman replied: ‘We are not responding to this.’

The comment is the latest evidence of the bitter rift in Mr Miliband’s Shadow Cabinet that threatens to wreck his General Election strategy.

Mr Alexander is accused of blocking bids to persuade Mr Miliband to adopt radical new policies. He believes Labour should ‘play safe’ and rely on UKIP to split the Tory vote.

But a growing number of critics say the economic revival means Labour must do more to oust David Cameron.

Mr Alexander, Labour’s foreign affairs spokesman, has been the subject of an increasingly hostile campaign by Labour foes.

The row has united Ms Harman and Mr Balls, the most senior members of Mr Miliband’s team.

Ms Harman has complained privately that Mr Alexander ‘is keeping me out’ of vital discussions on Labour tactics.

Unpopular: According to a reliable eyewitness, Ms Harman said to Mr Balls: 'The trouble with Douglas is that he just isn't engaged at the moment.'

And Mr Balls and Mr Alexander loathe each other: as The Mail on Sunday reported earlier this year, they have come close to blows and had to be physically dragged apart by Tessa Jowell.

The schism has led to the worst Labour infighting since Mr Miliband beat older brother David to become leader in 2010.

And it has reignited personal squabbles that go back to the Blair-Brown era.

Critics of Mr Alexander accuse him of being ‘absurdly cautious’ and a ‘control freak’.

They blame his allies for the disclosure that Barack Obama election guru Arnie Graf, brought over from the US to advise Mr Miliband, did not have a work permit. Mr Alexander’s camp reject the claims. 

The Mail on Sunday revealed last week how Labour strategy chief Michael Dugher threatened to resign, telling Mr Miliband that Mr Alexander was ‘impossible’ to work with.

A senior Labour figure said: ‘Douglas thinks he is cleverer than everyone else and won’t talk to anyone. His personal communication skills are zero. He is out of step with nearly everyone around him and it is starting to destablilize the leader’s office.

‘He gives the impression he knows more about strategy than anyone else but he ran campaigns for Gordon Brown and David Miliband and made a mess of both of them. It doesn’t help that Ed Miliband doesn’t have the authority to knock heads together.’
