Killed by racists? Alfred Wright, 28, whose 
family have raised questions after his mutilated  body was found in an area of Texas notorious 
for its racism

The brother of an American Idol 
contestant whose mutilated body was found in brush in East Texas may have been the 
victim of a racist murder, his family claim.

Alfred
 Wright from Jasper, Texas, the brother of American Idol contestant 
Savion, was found dead last November with his eyes, several teeth, his left ear and his tongue missing.

Nevertheless, authorities concluded that he died from a drugs overdose.

A
 small town near the Louisiana border, Jasper is infamous as the site of
 the 1998 murder of James Byrd Jr, who was tied to the back of a pick up
 by white supremacists and dragged for three miles along an asphalt 
road.

Now suspicions have 
been raised that Mr Wright's death, like that of Mr Byrd's, was also a 
racist murder, after a claim that he was carrying on an affair with the 
relative of a white police officer.

A local source told Radar: 'Alfred was dating the white relative of someone in law enforcement.

'You can’t do that in East Texas. If you’re a black man, you’ll get killed.They still have cross burnings in that area!'

Further deepening the mystery surrounding Mr Wright's death, his wife claims that she found three charges he made at local hotels while she and their children were away in the month before he died.

And a private investigator hired by Mr Wright's family claims that local police knew that he had been in some kind of relationship, the nature of which is unclear, with a woman related to the sheriff.

'[They] knew about the rumours,' Chuck Foreman told Radar. 'That's what makes it interesting. [They] definitely knew.'

The
 body of Mr Wright, who was just 28 years old, was discovered by 
volunteers last November, in an area of thick East Texas underbrush that
 had been supposedly already scoured by Sabine County sheriff's 
deputies.

His family felt 
forced to act themselves to track down their son after the initial 
police search - which found some of his possessions and portions of his 
clothing - was called off after just four days.

Dressed
 in just underwear, a pair of spotless tennis shoes, and with one sock 
on his left foot, his body was badly disfigured - his eyes, left ear and
 several teeth were missing, and his tongue had apparently been torn 
out.

According to some reports, his throat also appeared to have been slashed.

is a suggestion that he had been having an affair with the relative of a
policeman, and his wife said she found he had made payments at a hotel shortly before his death

Mr Wright's father Douglas was one of 
the first to the scene where his son's body was discovered amid brambles
 on that rainy November night.

'He was just, if I might say, he was neatly laid. He was neatly laid,' he told CNN.

'What
 was weird about his sock,' the elder Mr Wright went on, was that it 
'was clean, and his sock was pulled up with his phone stuck in it as if 
he was in a Sunday school class. Neat. His tennis shoes was very clean.'

An
 official post-mortem investigation concluded that Mr Wright had died 
accidentally as a result of drug intoxication, and that his mutilations 
were the result of animal and insect activity.

But
 Dr Lee Ann Grossberg, a forensic pathologist hired by Wright's family, 
said her preliminary review made findings that were 'suspicious of 
homicidal violence'.

The questions Alfred Wright's have posed to the authorities include:

Dr 
Grossberg said she needs more photos and documents from the 
investigation to determine if tissue missing from Mr Wright's neck and 
face might have been caused before his death.

'For
 me, the most frustrating thing has been not knowing what happened,' 
said Lauren Wright, Alfred Wright's widow. 'We don't have closure.'

Mr
 Wright was last seen on November 7. He had been driving around, 
visiting his physical therapy patients, when his truck broke down at 
around dusk by grocery store in a rural area just south of Hemphill, 
about 170 miles north-east of Houston.

He called his wife in Jasper, who sent his parents to pick him up. When his parents arrived about an hour later, Mr Wright's truck was there but he had vanished.

Wright's wristwatch and pieces of the scrubs he had been wearing were found in a nearby pasture a day later.

The search was called off just after four days, with Sabine County Sheriff Thomas Maddox telling reporters all resources had been exhausted and he believed this was a missing person case.

Mutilated: Mr Wright was found dead last November with body parts, including his eyes, several teeth and tongue missing, and stripped to his underwear. But authorities claim he died from a drugs overdose

The U.S. Department of Justice this 
week took over the investigation into Mr Wright's death, which has been 
headed by Texas Rangers since the Sabine County Sheriff's Office handed 
it over in November.

Tom
 Vinger, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, which 
oversees the Texas Rangers, said his agency could not comment on details
 of the case because of the ongoing investigation.

Cade Bernsen, one of the attorneys for
 the Wright family, said that he thought the initial search for their 
son's remains had been 'incredibly ill-performed'.

'It's questionable how his body was not found when the sheriff said (they) ran dogs through there.' he added.

A
 toxicology report found drugs in Wright's body, including cocaine and 
methamphetamine. The autopsy report did not narrow down when Wright 
died.

'I don't feel (the drugs in his system) had anything to do with his demise,' Mrs Wright said.

Though
 Mr Wright had been facing a federal embezzlement charge in Tennessee, 
his wife said she doesn't believe that had anything to do with his 
disappearance.

Much to live for: A toxicology report found 
drugs in Wright's body, including cocaine and methamphetamine, but his 
wife said she can't believe that the drugs had anything to do with his untimely death

Mr Bernsen said the Texas Rangers have refused to provide additional information that Grossberg needs to finish her report. And
 while the attorney added that there is no evidence this was a hate 
crime, Mrs Wright, who is white, said she is not ruling out the 
possibility.

'We can't forget the history of the area because we're both from here,' she said.

She described her husband as a hard-working, dedicated father.

Eerie similarities: Mr Wright's death has awoken memories of the killing of James Byrd Jr, who was tied to a truck by white supremacists and dragged to his death along a rural road in the same area

Davilyn
 Walston, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern 
District of Texas, said her agency is reviewing the investigation but 
declined further comment.

J.
 Kevin Dutton, district attorney for Sabine and San Augustine counties, 
said in a statement he 'welcomes the investigation by the Justice 
Department as there are serious allegations being made that need to be 
resolved.']

Mr Wright's younger brother, Savion, was eliminated from American Idol last week after singing a song dedicated to his late brother.

Sheriff Maddox said on Friday that he could not comment on an open investigation.
