Jamaican rapper Shaggy has found an unlikely impersonator – in the form of a posh businessman from London.

And now his biggest fan – Oliver Goss – has found worldwide fame after grandstanding his talents in the men’s toilets of The Boogaloo pub in Highgate.

After his mates filmed him rapping along to the 2001 hit Angel featuring Rayvon, they uploaded the video to Facebook where it has been liked more than 115,000 times.

Blond Mr Goss, who is sporting a suit complete with pocket hanky, is introduced to the camera when another man says: ‘We’ve found the best Shaggy impression in London.’

Another pal joins him and after an initially shaky start where they mumble along to the lyrics, the duo pick up momentum before launching into a fully blown rendition of the Noughties hit.

When a man in a flat cap tries to enter the gents he stands no chance as the pair beatbox and cry out Shaggy’s trademark line ‘shabba’.

Mr Goss, who is a business consultant, has taken to Twitter to join in with the social media reaction.

His twitter feed includes pictures of people playing polo, a variety of different coloured chinos, and a video of Boris Johnson.

Despite some viewers being initially disappointed that the video was not an impersonation of Shaggy from the TV cartoon Scooby-Doo, the reaction was largely positive.

George Snowden wrote on Facebook: ‘That’s mint, almost as good as Scooby-Doo.’
