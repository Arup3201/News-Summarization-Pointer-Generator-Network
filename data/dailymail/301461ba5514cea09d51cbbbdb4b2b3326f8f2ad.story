Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes insists his team can't rely on Celtic crumbling in the Premiership title race.

The Dons could move four points clear of the reigning champions with an eighth straight victory when they take on St Mirren in Paisley on Saturday afternoon.

Yet McInnes has told his players that they shouldn't be looking to Ronny Deila's men showing any signs of strain.

Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes is targeting his eighth straight victory as the Dons face St Mirren on Saturday 

'I don't think Celtic see it as pressure,' he said. 'That's just part and parcel of being Celtic. They are expected to win things.'

Aberdeen's run of league wins, built in part on a sequence of seven clean sheets, needs to be extended just 90 minutes further to equal the series of victories achieved back in season 1988-89.

McInnes, recognising the importance of continuing to get results while his team are in flying form, admitted: 'From our point of view, I think nobody expected us to win seven games in a row.

Ronny Deila's Celtic are hot on the heels of Aberdeen in the race for the Scottish Premiership title 

'I get that, because we've not done that very often in our history. We've won that – and that has allowed us to get where we are. For that to continue is a big, big ask. But it's something we'll be striving to achieve.

'The next challenge is to win eight in a row. If we continue to win games, then we will be satisfied that we're improving as a team. I do see the improvement in us from last season and that's all I was looking for at the start of the season, regardless of where we finish in the league.

'I do believe that, while we've got this bit of momentum, it's important to try to channel it properly.'
