Who needs airport bartenders when there's a perfect pint pulling machine to do all the hard work? 

This genius automated beer dispenser is quite the draw in the All Nippon Airways Alliance Gold Lounge at Japan's Kansai International Airport (KIX). 

The Asahi machine works exactly like a fountain drinks dispenser but with one very important extra: it has a tilt feature to help drinkers get the right amount of head on their drink, without spilling a single drop.

Self-service: A man grabs a glass and prepares to use the automated draft beer dispenser

Thirsty travellers help themselves to a chilled pint glass and simply place it on the drinks stand, before pressing a button on the machine. 

With a soft, robotic whirr the back of the stand swiftly moves forward, gently tilting as golden liquid streams down from the overhead nozzle. 

Pour: The man places the glass in the machine and presses the buttons

Tilt: Moments later the machine tilts the glass at the required angle and pours in the beer

Head: The machine then straightens up the glass and a head is poured into the glass creating the perfect pint

As the pint glass gets filled, the stand reverts to its original position and a six-second spurt from the machine fills the rest of the glass with a perfect head. 

The perfectly poured suds are now ready to drink

The automated draft beer dispenser is one of only an estimated five in the country.

The machines have been around for quite some time but are uncommon outside of international departure lounges.
