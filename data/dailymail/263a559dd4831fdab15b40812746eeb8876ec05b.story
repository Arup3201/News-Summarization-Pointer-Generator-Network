More than 74 years after the Battle of Britain, aviation buffs will be able to take to the skies in the very same planes in which thousands of heroic RAF pilots fought for their country against the Luftwaffe.

Boultbee Flight Academy, based in Sussex, has become the first in the country to offer passenger flights inside Spitfires.

From £2,750, Britons can experience what it feels like to soar in one of two reconditioned fighter planes - which were seen as a key aircraft in Britain's survival during the Second Wold War.

Take to skies: Britons will be able to experience flying in reconditioned WWII spitfires

A 50-minute flight to the white cliffs of The Needles at Alum Bay, Isle of Wigh will cost £4,750, while a package for two - involving flying in formation, comes to £10,000. 

Passengers can enjoy a 30 or 50-minute flight in the two-seater planes, which has a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine and recorded speeds of up to 400mph.

Matt Jones, managing director of Boultbee Flight Academy, said: 'Flying on one of these iconic war birds is an exceptional experience that everyone should have the opportunity to try. 

Patriots: 1,878 RAF pilots participated in the Battle of Britain in 1940

The WWII air campaign by the German Air Force occurred over several months in 1940.

The UK suffered devastating aerial bombings as the Luftwaffe attempted to destroy Britain's air defences.

The RAF's efforts prevented Hitler's plans to invade Britain and was a crucial turning point in the war, marking Germany's first major defeat.

348 British pilots were killed during the campaign.

'Trust me when I say that it is the most emotional, historical and exhilarating experience available in aviation today, and we very much look forward to sharing the aircraft with everyone who comes to visit.'

The new offer, which sees the Spitfires take off from Goodwood Aerodrome in Chichester, West Sussex, is also being hailed as a way to conserve the Vickers Supermarine Spitfires for years to come.

Mark added: 'Their involvement will contribute significantly to ensuring Spitfires keep flying well into the future.'

Boultbee Academy is the only accredited Spitfire training school in the world. 

The full experience, including briefing and flight, lasts four hours and is available in morning and afternoon slots.
