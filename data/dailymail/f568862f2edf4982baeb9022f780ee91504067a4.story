A bystander who was hit round the head with a torch by an enraged Domino's Pizza driver has been offered compensation - in the form of £200 worth of pizza.

John Murray shouted at 25-year-old Guy Swansborough to slow down after he saw him driving fast towards two young men who were crossing a road in Caversham, Reading, Berkshire.

Swansborough shouted back at Mr Murray before grabbing a large torch from his car, stepping onto the pavement and whacking him over the head with it.

Now the pizza franchise's head office has offered Mr Murray £200 in vouchers as compensation.

But he told The Sun on Sunday he had broken his jaw and the offer caused him 'even more pain', adding: 'It's an insult'.

Reading magistrates heard Swansborough was wearing a Domino's Pizza uniform when he attacked 35-year-old Mr Murray, who was with his fiancée Julie Wilkes, on May 15.

The attack only stopped when Mr Murray ran at Swansborough and rugby tackled him to the ground, the court heard. 

Hurt: Mr Murray was accidentally given £200 in vouchers which all expired at the end of August

Claire French, prosecuting, said: 'Driving down the same road at speed and wheels screeching was the defendant who nearly lost control of the car, and as two young males crossed the road the car was driven very close to them, in Mr Murray's opinion it was at them.

'After telling Swansborough to "slow down, mate," Swansborough reacted by stating "You ******* talking to me mate?" with Mr Murray replying "Slow down there are kids about."'

The prosecutor said Mr Murray 'was left feeling dizzy and numbness to his hand' after the attack, while The Sun on Sunday reported Mr Murray had broken his jaw and could not eat solid food for a week.

Ms French added: 'He saw the man, who he had never seen before, coming at him again and he ran towards him and the pair toppled backwards onto the floor where they tussled before another man arrived at the scene to help.'

A Domino's Pizza spokesman Sarah McGhie said the gift of free pizza had been a 'gesture of goodwill'.

But the offer went sour when it emerged Mr Murray had only until the end of August to use all of his vouchers - which the firm admitted was an error and later rectified.

Ms McGhie told MailOnline: 'The driver was instantly dismissed. That is without a doubt behaviour we do not tolerate.

'After the driver was dismissed, one of the directors at head office gave Mr Murray a call to express that that's not how we expect Domino's drivers to act.

'He offered him some vouchers as a gesture of goodwill. It was nothing like "here, have some pizza and let's hear no more of it".

'Unfortunately those vouchers were short-dated to the end of August, which was an error. We hold our hands up over that and we changed when it was pointed out to us.

'The same director called Mr Murray over the mistake and he said it was okay and laughed about it.'

Swansborough, from Caversham, admitted assaulting Mr Murray and possessing of cannabis during a hearing at Reading Magistrates' Court.

In police interview he told officers he had been 'hot-headed' on the day of the attack.

Swansborough is due to be sentenced at Reading Magistrates' Court on August 11.
