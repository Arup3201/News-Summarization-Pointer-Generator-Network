Roy Cockrum had once vowed to lead a life of poverty - but a winning $259million Powerball ticket has changed everything for the former Tennessee monk. 

Cockrum, 58, of Knoxville, appeared at the Tennessee Lottery headquarters in Nashville Thursday to claim Tennessee's largest ever jackpot. He plans to accept a lump sum payment of $115million.

The 58-year-old former member of an Episcopal monastic order bought the ticket at a Kroger store in Knoxville June 11.

The winning numbers in the June 11 drawing were 14-18-25-33-49 plus a Powerball of 23.

Lottery officials say it's the largest prize ever won in Tennessee Lottery history.

The
 store where Cockrum purchased the lucky ticket received $25,000, but 
the owners of the business turned around and donated the entire sum to 
five charities in the Knoxville area.

A native of Knoxville, Roy Cockrum earned an acting degree from Northwestern University in Illinois and worked for 20 years as an actor and stage manager for theater and TV productions.

He later switched gears, becoming Brother Roy with the Society of Saint John the Evangelist, an Episcopal community in Massachusetts, the station WATE reported. 

‘I really believe the best way to prepare for this tsunami of cash has been to live under a vow of poverty for a number of years,’ Cockrum said. ‘It gives great perspective.’

Mr Cockrum left monastic life in 2009 and moved back to Knoxville to take care of his elderly parents. He is single and self-employed.

Speaking at a press conference at the Tennessee Lottery offices Thursday, a beaming Roy Cockrum described the heart-pounding moment when he realized that he hit the jackpot.

At first, he thought he only matched three numbers and was thrilled that he won $500.

‘But then -- wait a minute, wait a minute -- there’s another number, and finally I realized I hit the jackpot. It literally knocked me to my knees. My prayer was simple – “Lord have Mercy!” the former monk said.

Eventually he collected himself and went about his day, taking his mother to a medical appointment. All the while, the winning ticket was burning a hole in his pocket.

It took Cockrum a long three weeks to claim his prize. During that time, the Knoxville resident said that everywhere he went, people speculated about the identity of the mystery Powerball winner not knowing that he was in their midst.

After setting aside a portion of his fortune toward his pension fund, Cockrum is planning to use a large chunk of the money to start a foundation that will support performing arts organizations around the country.

The rest of the prize will go to a long list of religious organizations and local charities. Cockrum was quick to point out that he has already selected all the beneficiaries of his largesse.  

And it was not the first time that Lady Luck has smiled upon Roy Cockrum.

He revealed that years earlier, Publishers Clearing House Prize Patrol came knocking on his door with balloons and an oversize check.

‘I have no doubt that I am one of the luckiest people in the world. I am so grateful. I am so blessed,’ he said.
