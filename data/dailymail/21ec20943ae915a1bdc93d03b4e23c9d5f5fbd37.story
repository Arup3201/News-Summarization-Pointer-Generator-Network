An elderly bus passenger is thought to have caused a nine-vehicle pile up when he attacked the driver for refusing to stop and let him off.

Shocking video footage captured on a security camera shows the 83-year-old man punching the driver and attempting to wrench him from his seat on the still-moving bus in Tianjin, China.

Terrified passengers can be seen screaming and clinging on to overhead rails as the driver struggles to keep control of the bus, which lurches violently from side to side before colliding with several other vehicles.
