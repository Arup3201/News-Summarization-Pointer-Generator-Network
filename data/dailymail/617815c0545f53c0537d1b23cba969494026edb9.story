Bacary Sagna is expected to arrive at Manchester City on Monday to hold formal talks with the Barclays Premier League champions.

Just hours after attending Arsenal's trophy parade on the streets of Islington following their FA Cup final win over Hull, the France international could conclude his anticipated deal to City later on Monday.

Sportsmail revealed on Friday how Sagna would hold formal discussions with City chiefs this week.

Sagna meets up with France's World Cup party later this week and wants his future decided before the tournament to ensure he heads to Brazil with a clear head.

If everything goes according to plan, the right-back could even undergo his City medical on Monday ahead of agreeing to join Manuel Pellegrini's men.

It is understood Sagna will be offered a three-year deal worth around £150,000-per-week during today's discussions.

City look to have fought off late interest in Sagna from arch-rivals Manchester United.

Incoming Old Trafford boss Louis van Gaal wanted to hijack Pellegrini's move for Sagna having identified the right-back position as one he wants to strengthen.

But City's move for the Frenchman was already at an advanced stage and barring a collapse in negotiations, the Frenchman should become the Etihad Stadium club's first summer signing.

The news has been expected for sometime, with Sagna rejecting three contract extensions at Arsenal - the last one a three-year £80,000-per-week deal.

But the fact he looks set to become the latest Gunner to join City - following in the footsteps of Emmanuel Adebayor, Kolot Toure, Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy - will come as a major blow to Arsenal.

Arsenal fans at yesterday's parade made their feeling regarding Sagna crystal clear as they sang: 'We want you to stay'.

However, Sagna's anger at the way his contract situation has been handled by Arsenal has played an integral role in his decision to quit the club.
