There was hair-pulling, spitting, and fisticuffs at the school gates – and that was just the parents.

Two young mothers have been found guilty of assault after an unseemly brawl outside their children’s school in south London.

As Kelly Giles was waiting to pick up her child from Merton Abbey Primary School, she was confronted by Keyleigh Gore, who claimed she had called her 'fat' and insulted her daughter.

Gore, 25, pushed Miss Giles who fell back on to a low level wall and then started repeatedly punching her.

Fisher, who initially tried to break up the pair, then assaulted Miss Giles by pushing her in the shoulder and then hitting her in the face.

Miss Giles was left with extensive bruising to her lower back, arms and above her left eye as a result of the attack.

Both Keyleigh Gore and Sasha Fisher were hauled before magistrates today following the childish spat outside Merton Abbey Primary School on March 12 this year.

Gore, from Wimbledon, South London, admitted she had pushed Miss Giles in order to 'get her off her' after the two became embroiled in a hair-pulling tussle, she claimed.

Sasha Fisher, 21, claimed that she initially tried to break up the fight but later hit Miss Giles in the face in 'self defence'

Fisher, 21, who lives on the same estate as her accomplice, said she had broken up the two women and that she had later hit Miss Giles in the face with her palm only because she had feared for her safety.

After a three-hour trial, both were found guilty of assault by beating after their claims of self-defence were rejected by officials at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court.

John Brummell, chairman of the bench, said it was clear that the injuries suffered by Miss Giles were as a result of the two beatings dolled out by the other women.

He said: 'The issue in this case is self-defence.

'We found Miss Gore was the initial aggressor.

'She pushed Miss Giles on to a low wall and proceeded to punch Miss Giles.

'Miss Fisher initially intervened but then subsequently assaulted Miss Giles by punching her.

'The extensive injuries suffered were as a result of these two assaults.'
