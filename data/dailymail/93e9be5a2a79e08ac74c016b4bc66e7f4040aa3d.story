Graham Dwyer, 42, from Foxrock, south Dublin, was convicted by unanimous verdict of stabbing 36-year-old Elaine O'Hara to death in August 2012

A married architect with a fetish for stabbing women during sex has been found guilty of murdering a mentally ill childcare worker and dumping her body in the Dublin mountains. 

Following a harrowing nine week trial, Graham Dwyer, 42, from Foxrock, south Dublin, was convicted by unanimous verdict of stabbing 36-year-old Elaine O'Hara to death in August 2012.

The father-of-three, who was filmed knifing sexual partners and admitted having an affair with his vulnerable victim, faces a mandatory life sentence.

Dwyer was remanded in custody at the Central Criminal Court.  

Judge Tony Hunt told the court he '110% agreed' with the jury's decision based on the evidence - which on three occasions was so gruesome the public had to leave the courtroom. 

Ms O'Hara's family members were in tears and embraced when the guilty verdict was read out.

Dwyer closed his eyes and shook his head when he heard the verdict.  

The trial of the architect and family man was a graphic depiction of bloodlust and unnerving perversion. 

A huge swathe of evidence involved detail of BDSM sex, the 'Gorean' lifestyle of people living out a slave-master philosophy and a window into the life of a sexual deviant. 

Such was the shocking nature of some videos, photos and documents revealed in court that the media self-censored on occasions as well as the judge clearing the public galleries.  

In one, Ms O'Hara was bound, her feet in chains and her arms behind her back, while a gag muffled her screams as she was repeatedly stabbed her in the abdomen from behind.

'Now that wasn't bad, was it?,' Dwyer asked after he ejaculated on her. 

Thousands of disturbing text messages, backed-up on Ms O'Hara's laptop, revealed the unwavering control and power her 'Sir' (Dwyer) had over his Slave (O'Hara) and the mental torment she suffered throughout their sexual relationship.

Dwyer had also written vile and sickening first person accounts about him kidnapping, raping, torturing and murdering series of women, including American woman Darci Day who testified against him.

'I had always fantasised about killing ever since I was a teenager and I got hard every time I had a knife in my hand, wielding the power knowing that I could decide who lived and died, Just like my hero. God,' he wrote. 

In one text to Ms O'Hara he wrote: 'I want to stick my knife in flesh while I am sexually aroused. Blood turns me on and I’d like to stab a girl to death some time.'

Another said: 'My urge to rape, stab or kill is huge. You have to help me control or satisfy it.' 

Images and links from a phone Dwyer owned included women being stabbed, strangled or killed some of which came from a gore website.

The body of Ms O'Hara, from Stepaside, Co Dublin, was discovered by a dog walker in the Dublin mountains

Dwyer and his wife Gemma were both out celebrating their birthdays on Friday, September 13, 2013 when a dog walker found Ms O'Hara's skeletal remains in the Dublin mountains. 

The same week, an angler spotted something shiny in the shallow muddy waters in the Vartry Reservoir in Roundwood, Co Wicklow.

Within days, Ms O'Hara's keys, keys, clothing, two mobile phones, and her rucksack carrying a variety of sex toys - including ropes, cuffs, a gimp mask and restraints - had been retrieved. 

Despite the water damage, experts managed to lay bare the extent of the controlling relationship by accessing more than 200 text messages between the 'Master' and 'Slave'. 

It was revealed in court the chilling final text sent to Ms O'Hara read: 'Go down to shore and wait'. 

Ms O'Hara was last seen at the Shanganagh cemetery, where her mother is buried, and was never seen again

Her car was parked at Shangahagh Cemetery, south Dublin, where her mother is buried, and she was never seen again. Some, including her family, feared she had died by suicide.

When her remains and personal belongings were recovered a small missing person's case was upgraded to a murder probe.

Dwyer was charged in October 2013 with her murder. He had denied murdering Ms O'Hara and claimed she was suicidal when she went missing on August 22, 2012, hours after being discharged from hospital for psychiatric treatment. 

She had been admitted to hospital for depression some 14 times, self harmed, and tried to take her own life three times.

He was refused bail three times over the last 18 months. 

The trial had been pushed back for a day when the foreman of the jury had asked to clarify what exactly they were finding Dwyer guilty of.  

The prosecution has asked sentencing be adjourned to April 20 until the victim impact statements are prepared.
