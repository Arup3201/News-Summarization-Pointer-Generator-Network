Islamic State militants are planning the creation of a 'cyber caliphate' protected by their own encryption software - from behind which they will launch massive hacking attacks on the U.S. and the West.

Both Islamic State and Al Qaeda claim to be actively recruiting skilled hackers in a bid to create a team of jihadist computer experts capable of causing devastating cyber disruptions to Western institutions.

They are now boasting it is only a matter of time before their plan becomes a reality.

Junaid Hussain, who was jailed two years' ago for hacking personal information from Tony Blair, is thought to be spearheading the ISIS cyber team's activities from Syria where he fled to last year

Fox News reported the terror groups were using social media to attract more computer-savvy young recruits.

Thought to be among those working within the organisation's cyber team is British jihadist Junaid Hussain, who escaped to Syria while on police bail last year.

Hussain, 20, was jailed in 2012 for hacking into former Prime Minister Tony Blair's gmail account and posting the details online.

Steve Stalinsky, an executive director of the Middle East Media Research Institute, told Fox News: 'They are forward thinking and are experimenting with hacking. In the future, the jihadists' cyber army's activities will become a daily reality.'

It was reported the possible targets of the jihadists' cyber attacks will be the websites of U.S. government organisations, energy companies, transport systems and banks. 

Islamic State is noted for its use of advanced technology and social media on a scale unprecedented for such rebel groups.

Large numbers of Islamic State fighters are young, highly educated Westerners who are fighting the holy war with sophisticated backgrounds and training with digital technology.

Militants' use of Twitter and Facebook allows them to target an entire new generation of young possible recruits, while the beheading videos of James Foley and Steven Sotloff were created using skilled video and audio editing techniques.

Meanwhile, president Barack Obama has announced U.S. airstrikes on Islamic State targets will extend into Syria.

In a four-point plan laid out last night the U.S. leader announced coming airstrikes in both countries, additional support for Iraqi army units, counter-terrorism activities to hamstring ISIS, and renewed humanitarian aid for victims of ISIS militants.

'This counter-terrorism campaign will be waged through a steady, relentless effort to take out ISIL wherever they exist,' Obama vowed, referring to ISIS by its alternate name, 'using our air power and our support for partner forces on the ground.'

A senior Pentagon official confirmed that 'the U.S. military is ready to conduct direct action against ISIL targets in Syria.'

Britain has already drawn-up extensive plans to support the US that includes airstrikes and UK Special Forces forming ‘advisory’ training teams to instruct Kurdish fighters how to use heavy machine guns ‘gifted’ by Britain this week.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the advance of Islamic State poses a ‘clear and immediate’ threat to British national security.
