Nothing brings a smile to the Queen like some quality time with her favourite furry friends. So it's no wonder she was beaming on her recent visit to the Cotts Farm Equine Hospital in Narbeth, Wales.

A week into her 89th year, Her Royal Highness looked dazzling in a royal blue outfit with her diamond and pearl brooch and pearl earrings.

Neigh-ce to meet you: The Queen with horse Teaforthree and Rebecca Morris  of Cotts Farm Equine Hospital

The Queen left no-one out on her meet and greet at the hospital and even had a chance to wish the horses well from close quarters.

One cheeky stallion, Teaforthree, clearly hadn't been prepped on royal protocol and tried to have a nibble of Queen's royal garments -- much to the embarrassment of Cotts Farm's Rebecca Morris.

Accompanied by the centre's director Richard Coomer, she also visited the theatres where horses are operated on.

Playing for Her Majesty's pleasure was a video of equestrian surgery on a large projector.

The Queen's constant smile is another reminder of what an annus mirabilis it's been for The Queen.

With
 heir to the throne, Prince George, and Zara's baby Mia Grace to 
brighten up family life, Her Majesty has plenty to beam about.

The resounding success of The Cambridge's epic tour of Oz is another reason to lift her spirits. She can breath easy that the next generation are up
 to their royal duties.

Even little George, a sovereign in training, is shouldering his share of the workload by winning the public over with those super-cute smiles.

The Prince of Wales is now shouldering the more demanding engagements overseas and recently had a very successful debut standing in for the Sovereign at the trickiest Commonwealth summit in years. 

The Queen can now look forward to some of her favourite equestrian events of the year - the Royal Windsor Horse Show and Ascot.

The Cotts Equine is currently the only equine veterinary hospital in Wales. Their team of veterinary surgeons and assistants are highly specialised to treat all manor of ailments.

They have two full-time specialists, one in internal medicine and the other in surgery.

Things are looking up!: The Queen was full of cheer during her recent trip to Wales

The centre has thousands of patients registered in West Wales to whom they provide first opinion work and emergency services.

They also provide a 24 hour per day 365 days per year specialist referral service to patients from further afield.

The centre has helped horses from Southern Ireland and England as well as from Wales.

The hospital provides diagnostic services, treatment facilities including modern operating theatre suite an x-ray machine and safe stable housing.

They also have ambulatory vets on the road daily to bring routine and more urgent services to the yard.

They may not have known exactly who their latest visitor was, but we hope the royal visit will help the horses on the road to recovery.

For the centre the visit was a resounding success and lifted the spirits of horses, staff and nearby residents.
