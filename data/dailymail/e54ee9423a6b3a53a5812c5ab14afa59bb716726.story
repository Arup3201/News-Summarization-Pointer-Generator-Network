Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is set to see the disappearance of his constituency Sheffield Hallam but he may have the last laugh as the net result could be two new Liberal Democrat seats in the city

Liberal Democrats yesterday threatened to vote down plans to reduce the number of MPs, as it was revealed the changes could mean several of the party's highest-profile ministers  lose their seats.

Around a quarter of Lib Dems are affected by the redrawn constituency borders revealed by the Boundary Commission yesterday, compared with one in ten Labour MPs and a handful of Tories.

Lib Dem party president Tim Farron, Transport Minister Norman Baker and Energy Secretary Chris Huhne will all see their seats carved up or merged with others.

Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable – whose seat is also at risk in the shake-up – took aim at the proposals yesterday, even though his party had vowed to  support them as part of the Coalition deal.

Lord Tyler, the party’s constitutional affairs spokesman in the Lords, has indicated that Lib Dems will try to vote down the plans when they come to Parliament in 2013 following a two-year consultation.

The Government wants to cut the number of MPs from 650 to 600 and ensure constituencies have a similar number of voters – around 76,000 – so that everyone’s vote counts equally.

Despite Tory backing for the moves, David Cameron also faces a serious rebellion in his ranks from MPs who think the changes have been deliberately botched by the Boundary Commission to punish them for demanding such a radical shake-up.

MPs inundated their whips with complaints yesterday, warning they too may vote down the proposals.

Meanwhile Labour sources vowed to capitalise on the Lib Dem discontent and deliver a defeat to the Government.

Senior party figures including Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, his wife, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, and Olympics spokesman Tessa Jowell will all see their seats disappear.

Sources close to Nick Clegg made clear that the Deputy Prime Minister expects his Lib Dem MPs to vote for the changes, pointing out that the party’s election manifesto called for a reduction of 150 MPs in the Commons.

The source said: ‘There will be MPs of all sides who do not like  the Boundary Commission’s conclusions. They have two years to make their case to the Boundary Commission. But these plans are in the Coalition agreement.

‘We have more to lose than the Tories if we go around suggesting that things in the Coalition agreement are negotiable.’

But Dr Cable took a markedly different line yesterday, saying: ‘In order to get the right size of constituency, no account has been taken not just of borough boundaries, but any sense of identity. That will cause a lot of concern.’

The plans will see Dr Cable’s Twickenham seat making way for a new Richmond and Twickenham constituency spanning the Thames.That could force him into a  face-off for the new seat with  high-profile Tory Zac Goldsmith, the MP for Richmond.

Senior Tories reacted with fury to the Lib Dem complaints, pointing out that the party vowed to support the plans in exchange for holding last May’s referendum on the Alternative Vote.

Mr
Clegg, as forecast could see his Sheffield Hallam seat (current 
boundaries above) abolished and replaced with a new seat, Sheffield West
and Peniston (below)

Losers:
The most prominent Tory casualty is Tatton in Cheshire, represented by 
Chancellor George Osborne, left, and in the Labour ranks, shadow 
chancellor Ed Balls will see his Morley and Outwood seat condemned. 
Other senior figures facing serious disruption or disappearance of their
seats are Cabinet ministers Ken Clarke, far right, and Chris Huhne, 
second right. Iain Duncan Smith and Vince Cable will also be affected

Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude told the Mail: ‘It would be unprecedented for this to be voted down.

'The legislation that set up this completely independent process was voted through Parliament.

'It would be eccentric indeed to reject the results.’

Justice Secretary Ken Clarke, whose Nottingham seat will disappear, backed the plans.

He said: ‘At the moment your vote is far more important if you live in one of those places with small constituencies rather than one of those with big constituencies.

'It’s not really democratic.’

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman added: ‘It is for the boundary commissioners to decide where the constituency boundaries are drawn.’

But one Labour official said: ‘It’s just a series of ludicrous lines on a map.

'If Labour votes against these measures you would only need around 30 Lib Dems and a dozen Tories to rebel and the Government has a problem.’

A boundary change which would 'move' historic Gloucester Cathedral into the rural Forest of Dean Parliamentary constituency was condemned as 'madness' today.

The Boundary Commission wants to take the Westgate ward of Gloucester out of the city constituency and include it in the Forest of Dean to balance up the electorate when the number of MPs is reduced.

It would mean not just the 900-year-old cathedral but also Gloucester docks - the UK's most inland port -becoming part of the Forest constituency.

Gloucester's Tory MP Richard Graham said today: 'It's absolutely barking. To remove the Westgate ward from the city of Gloucester would be like Hamlet without the Prince. It's not Gloucester.'

Tony
Blair's former Sedgefield seat (above) could be snatched by the Tories 
under proposals for a new look Segefield and Yarm seat (below), which 
will take in chunks of the current Stockton South seat, including 
Eaglescliffe and Inglby, as well as Yarm

1. Why is the review being carried out?

The Government wants to make sure all constituencies have the same number of voters. At the moment people's votes can carry more or less weight depending on where they live

2. How are the boundaries worked out?

First
the electoral quota is calculated. This is the number of registered 
electors in the UK divided by the number of constituencies. The current 
electoral quota is 76,641. Every constituency in England – except two 
covering the Isle of Wight – must have a number of registered electors 
within 5 per cent of this figure.

Using this quota, the Boundary Commission allocates the specified number of constituencies among the nine regions of England

3. Can you comment on the proposals?

Yes.
All responses will be considered before the Boundary Commission decides
whether to publish revised proposals later in 2012, before making final
recommendations to the Secretary of State by 1 October 2013.

4. Will my MP or constituency be affected by the boundary changes?

The
new rules mean that there must be 600 constituencies in the UK, as 
opposed to 650 previously. This means the number of constituencies in 
England will be reduced by 31, from 533 to 502.

Both of these factors mean that there will be some changes to the majority of the existing constituencies. 

5. Will the boundary changes have an impact on my council tax, local services or insurance premiums?

No. The boundary changes only relate to Parliamentary constituencies.
