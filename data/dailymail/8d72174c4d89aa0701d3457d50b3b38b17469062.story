Roberto Martinez is determined rising star Ross Barkley won't have his head turned by the trappings of fame and fortune.

The 20-year-old has been exceptional for Everton over the past year and his manager has pledged to keep him on the straight and narrow for the good of club and country.

Barkley rounded off his breakthrough campaign with a call up into Roy Hodgson's England squad for the World Cup in Brazil and the midfielder, who has just signed a four-year contract, is set to have an even bigger impact in the season to come.

'Complete player': Roberto Martinez has praised Ross Barkley after the 20-year-old agreed a four-year contract at Everton this week and has promised to keep him on the right path 

Excellent: Barkley celebrates his goal against Manchester City at Goodison Park last season

In a summer when Jack Wilshere was caught smoking at a Las Vegas pool party and Ravel Morrison was charged with assault, Martinez says the next great English hope will not be led astray.

He told the Sunday Mirror: 'It is a problem we have in the modern game and society in general, so it is really important to make sure that we are there for him and and, when he needs support and guidance, we must commit ourselves to do that.

'He lives at home with his mum at the moment, but he has a good balance in his life. He loves playing football and being at home too.

'His lifestyle is pristine, he lives for the game and his family and wants to learn.

Call up: Barkley's reward for his fine season with Everton was a place in the England World Cup squad

Statement of intent: Everton have spent £28m on Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku, who had a brilliant season on loan at the club last year

'He is a young man, but he does everything in moderation, with the real focus of knowing that the next day he will be on the football pitch training.

'He has an incredible balance to his life, but I am sure he will be tested in the next few years and we have to make sure we are all around him to help whenever that is needed.

'But I have never seen a young man with things so clear in his mind, so humble and someone who won't have his heads turned by fame.'

Martinez describes Barkley as the 'complete footballer' and admits that he is building his team around him next season as Everton pursue qualification for the Champions League.

To that end, Martinez has splashed out £28m on Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku, who scored 16 goals in 30 appearances while on loan at Goodison Park last season.
