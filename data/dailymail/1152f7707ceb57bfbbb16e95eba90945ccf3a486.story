In his short life Jack Robinson's fight against an inoperable brain tumour inspired his heroes Gary Barlow and Matt Smith to help him complete his bucket list.

But the four-year-old's final 'unique' wish could only be fulfilled yesterday, when his family and friends said goodbye to him at his Star Wars themed funeral.

His parents Terence and Marie Robinson were determined to celebrate their son's life and passions, having his body carried in a Star Wars coffin on a white horse-drawn carriage surrounded by stormtroopers.

Tragedy: Jack Robinson died of a brain tumour after completing his bucket list which included meeting Gary Barlow - and his final wish was for a Star Wars funeral

Tribute: Jack was promised a 'unique' funeral by his parents, who paid tribute to their son and his mother Marie also recorded a version of his favourite son

His carriage was covered floral tributes, including one reading 
'Jedi' and wreaths in the shape of a lightsaber, Yoda and R2-D2.

Inside the church a brass band played the film's The
 Binary Sunset music - known as Luke Skywalker's theme - and the order 
of service read: 'Master Jack Robinson, joined the force 1st April 
2014'.

His father Terence said afterwards: 'Jack was a special boy, he was unique and brought everyone together.

'We needed to give him a unique send off, and the brilliant sunshine that came out for it was Jack looking down on us.

'I will always love you son.'

Guard of honour: Jack's bucket list inspired a number of celebrities to meet or contact him before he died

Much-loved: People lined the streets of his Hampshire village or walked with his coffin on his final journey

Final journey: The four-year-old's horse-drawn carriage was covered in floral tributes, including one reading 'Jedi' and another in the shape of a lightsaber

Moving: Jack was diagnosed with a brain tumour 
in January and surgeons tried to remove it but it was inoperable. After losing his fight last week family & friends requested stormtroopers for his final wish

Before his death last week Jack had 
several days he would never forget, especially when Take That singer 
Gary Barlow visited him in hospital.

Star
 Matt Smith also sent him personal video from the United States, and 
sang the Doctor Who theme tune for the boy he called the show's 'biggest
 fan in the world'.

He also got to ride in a fire engine and had an early birthday party.

Yesterday scores of people, including his identical twin brother Liam and three older sisters,  walked behind his coffin.

Others lined the streets of Denmead, Hampshire, as he was carried to his funeral at All Saints' church.

Mrs Robinson paid tribute to her son, whose diagnosis in January inspired fundraising across their community and touched the hearts of celebrities.

Passion: Jack loved Star Wars and even when her was ill in hospital he would play with toys and watch the films

Poignant: Traffic was stopped in the village as the funeral cortege slowly filed through Denmead on Thursday

A recording of her singing Ellie Goulding's How Long Will I Love You was played to around 60 mourners inside the church.

Mrs Robinson, a post office supervisor, said: 'Jack liked the song and I used to sing it with him.

'I had 10 weeks to think about the funeral and I wanted to do something different and special for him.

'I wanted Jack's funeral to have a twist, because he was so unique.

'I went to a recording studio and decided on Ellie Goulding's song because that's my message and words to Jack.

'It seemed quite fitting, and although no one likes to hear the sound of their own voice, I wanted to do it for Jack.

'Jack always had that cheeky grin on his face.

'Even when we were in hospital and I was sleeping next to him, he would poke me in the back with a lightsaber, then very quickly hit it and grin at me.

'In just four-and-a-half years, Jack achieved what many people spend a lifetime doing.

'He was only a little boy but he brought people together, from all over the world.'

Hero: Jack was described by Matt Smith as the 'world's biggest Doctor Who fan'

Magic moment: Doctor Who star Matt Smith sent 
Jack a personalised video message before he died, and even sang him the 
show's theme

Mrs Robinson had dialled 999 in January after spotting Jack's pupils were enlarged and he was having trouble breathing. A CT scan in hospital revealed a brain tumour.

Fluid was drained from his brain in a life-saving procedure, before surgeons revmoved 40 per cent of the tumour in a five-hour operation.

The rest of it was too dangerous and therefore became inoperable.

Jack was due to start a course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but his condition worsened.

His 'bucket list' of things to do before he died included meeting Mr Barlow.

Gary wrote: 'I'm on it' on Twitter after hearing of the challenge, then visited him at Southampton General Hospital, Hampshire.
