Power shift: The poll was commissioned after comments by Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont

The majority of Scots in favour of remaining part of the UK will be slashed by half if the economic revival leads to a major surge in David Cameron’s popularity, according to a new poll.

The boost for Scottish Nationalist leader Alex Salmond comes after a claim that he could use the ‘hated Tories’ to pull off a surprise victory in the independence referendum.

The Mail on Sunday has learned that Scottish Labour Party leader Johann Lamont told Ed Miliband last week that if Scots think the Tories will win the 2015 Election and be in power for ‘between five and 15 years’, they are more likely to vote to quit the UK.

A Survation poll in Scotland for The Mail on Sunday provides evidence to back up Ms Lamont’s argument.

The majority of 20 per cent in favour of a ‘No’ to independence vote falls to 14 if voters believe Mr Cameron will defeat Mr Miliband.

And the gap narrows to just nine if voters believe Labour will be out of power for longer. The result is a tonic for Mr Salmond, whose supporters have been dismayed by polls showing that as few as one in four Scots want to leave the UK.

But the recent upturn in the UK economy, which cut Mr Miliband’s lead over Mr Cameron to one per cent in one survey, could change that. According to Survation, if Britain’s economic fortunes and Tory ratings continue to rise, it will have an effect on the referendum result in September.

Verdict: The result of the poll on how Scots would change their vote for independence if the Tories win

Asked by Survation if they intended to vote ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to quitting the UK, 52 per of Scots said ‘No’, with 32 in favour of ‘Yes’ – broadly in line with recent trends.

However, when asked how they would vote if they believed Mr Cameron would win in 2015, the anti-independence majority slips. A total of 49 said they would vote ‘No’ with 35 in favour of ‘Yes.’

And when asked how they would vote if they thought the Tories would be in power for up to 15 years, the ‘No’ vote goes down to 47, with the ‘Yes’ vote catching up on 38.

The results reflect the deep unpopularity of the Conservatives in Scotland. They have only one MP in Westminster compared with 41 Labour MPs from Scottish seats.

The figures are bound to be seized 
upon by Mr Salmond to motivate supporters. The Mail on Sunday 
commissioned the survey after learning of the comments by Ms Lamont at a
 private meeting with Mr Miliband and his Shadow Cabinet in London last 
week.

She begged them to send more English Labour MPs to Scotland to tell the public they do not want Scotland to break away. There was a risk of a rise in support for the ‘Yes’ campaign if Scots believed the Tories would win the Election, she said.

A Labour insider said: ‘Lamont made a very powerful argument. She said Miliband and co have got to get off their backsides and go to Scotland to join the “No” campaign and convince Scots they can beat Cameron in 2015.’

The results pose a ‘Catch 22’-style dilemma for Mr Cameron. If his economic recovery plan stays on course, it will increase his chances of staying in No 10 – but it could make it harder for him to convince Scots not to cut ties with the UK.
