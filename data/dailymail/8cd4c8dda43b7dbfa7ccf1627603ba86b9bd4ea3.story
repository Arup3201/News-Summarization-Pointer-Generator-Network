The staff at a car dealership who decided to post a video in which they shame a pizza delivery man are now getting a taste of their own medicine.

Workers who have been identified as employees at F & R Auto Sales in Westport, Massachusetts, made a worker from Palace Pizza return and give them back their tip after they claimed that he just ran off with the money.

Making the entire thing even more cruel is the fact that they gave him two twenties and two fives on a bill of $42, making it seem clear that the extra money was for him - something he even confirmed with the workers.

Cruel: Workers who have been identified as employees at F & R Auto Sales in Westport, Massachusetts, made a worker from Palace Pizza return and give them back their tip

The Internet quickly responded, flooding their Yelp page with bad reviews and attacking them on social media 

The delivery driver has been identified as Jarrid Tansey according to Boston.com.

'It just doesn’t make sense why you’d hand me a bill that you were just gonna have me drive back here to give you back anyway,' Tansey says in the video. 

'I’m not mad, I just had to waste my resources coming back here.'

At this point, the ringleader of the group says to him; 'So listen: The manager apologized once for you. Do you want him to apologize again for you?'

Tansey decides to leave at this point, and as he does the woman in the office can be heard saying; 'Out the door before I put my foot in your ass.'

Another man in the office says; 'Get the f***ing owner and the manager on the phone, I want that motherf***er done.' 

He then adds, 'I want him fired.' 

'So listen: The manager apologized once for you. Do you want him to apologize again for you?' asked tghe man in blue in the bottom left

'Get the f***ing owner and the manager on the phone, I want that motherf***er done,' said another employee after the man left

After posting the video on YouTube, the dealership soon made it private as the Internet quickly and loudly responded to their cruel behavior, flooding their Facebook page with comments, as well as using Twitter to lash out and going on their Yelp page. 

People are also showing support for Tansey, with one person writing, 'The Internet has your back bro,' and a GoFundMe page for the delivery man already raising over $1,000.

'This isn’t the first time we have had problems with F&R Auto,' said Pizza Palace manager Adam Willoughby.

'I was the manager on that night, and today they came and spoke to me, profusely apologized. We both want to make things right between us. We don’t want any bad blood.'

The dealership has yet to publicly respond however, though they say the police are investigating the ongoing harassment against them.
