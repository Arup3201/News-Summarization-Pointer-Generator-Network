Horrifying photos have emerged which appear to show young children starving to death in Syria as a result of a nine-month seige of their town.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based group that 
collects information from a network of anti-regime activists in Syria, posted images of two young boys believed to have died at the weekend from marasmus, a type of severe malnutrition that can very quickly lead to 
death if not treated.

Although the clips have not been independently verified, one of the boy's is believed to be  Ibrahim Khalil, 4, from Mouadamiya, a rebel-held Damascus suburb.

Grim: Horrifying photos have emerged which appear to show young children starving to death in Syria

A video posted online shows him lying on a bed having his shirt cut off as a medical team give him oxygen while his chest moves up and down heavily.

A photo taken later appears to show him laid out in a mortuary on a white bed with a white silk cover.

The harrowing image depicts the true extent of his starvation showing his sunken cheekbones and tiny ribs protruding from his emaciated frame.

Posting the photos on its Facebook page the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights wrote that it 'urgently calls on the Syrian Red Crescent and the Red Cross, as well as all aid and relief organisations working in Syria, to work on immediately negotiation to break the siege and supply the tens of thousands of civilians in the besieged parts of Mou'adamiya the vital food and medical equipment.'

Opposition activist Ahmed Al-Muadami  said the town has been under siege by Syrian troops since last November.

'We ran out of food supplies and we cannot get anything into the town,' he told CNN.

Determined: 'The suffering of civilians in Syria has now reached unprecedented levels, and there appears to be no end in sight,' said Magne Barth, head of the ICRC¿s delegation in the country

Flee: Many Syrians are desperate to leave the country and today the head of the U.N. refugee agency in Syria says seven million Syrians, or almost one-third of the population, have been displaced by the country's civil war

'We haven't seen a piece of bread for six months now,' said another resident, Abu Alnour. 'We went through our food supplies, local produce and cattle.'

Mr Alnour said government checkpoints and snipers are blocking all the roads leading into the town and are not allowing anything in or out.

Last week the International Committee of the Red Cross reported severe shortages of vital medical supplies, food and water in a number of areas that have been sealed off for months and are not open to aid access.

'The suffering of civilians in Syria has now reached unprecedented levels, and there appears to be no end in sight,' said Magne Barth, head of the ICRC’s delegation in the country.

'Further escalation will likely trigger more displacement and add to humanitarian needs, which are already immense,' said Mr Barth.

'There are acute shortages of vital medical supplies, food and water in a number of areas that have been sealed off for months and to which the ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent have not been given access,' he said.

'In large parts of rural Damascus for example, people are dying because they lack medical supplies and because there are not enough medical personnel to attend to them. They also go hungry because aid can’t get through to them on a regular basis.'

Many Syrians are desperate to leave the country and today the head of the U.N. refugee agency in Syria says 7million Syrians - almost one-third of the population - have been displaced by the war.

Tarik Kurdi said that 5million of the displaced are still in Syria while about 2million have fled to neighboring countries. He says 2million children are among those directly affected by the war.

Kurdi says U.N. assistance has been a 'drop in the sea of humanitarian need' and that the funding gap is 'very, very wide.'

He says international donors have sent less than one-third of the money needed to help those displaced by the war.

More than 100,000 Syrians have been killed since an uprising against Syrian President Assad erupted in 2011.
