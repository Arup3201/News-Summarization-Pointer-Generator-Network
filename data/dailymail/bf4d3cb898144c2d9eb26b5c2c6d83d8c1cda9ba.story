This is the moment N-Dubz rapper Dappy sparked a mass brawl at a petrol station after two teenage girls turned down his advances.

The CCTV footage, which has been released after the singer was sentenced for assault and affray today, shows him approaching Grace Cochran and Serena Burton and asking them to come back to his studio.

The scene turns nasty when they turn him down and he becomes aggressive.

David 
Jenkins, who had been talking to the two 19-year-olds, steps in to protect 
them but is then spat at by Dappy before his friends Alfrd Miller and Kieran Vassell emerge and the fight breaks out.

Mr Jenkins was left with several broken
teeth while another man, Oliver Billson, suffered a 
swollen eye and a third, Christopher Gibson, suffered a broken nose.

Dappy broke down in tears and shouted 'Yes' when a judge spared him jail today as he was sentenced for his part in the incident today.

His lawyer Paul Greaney had pleaded with
judge Neil Stewart at Guildford Crown Court not to jail him claiming it would end his career in 
the music industry.

He also
argued the singer has already been punished enough because he can no 
longer travel to America to work due to his conviction.

The singer avoided an immediate jail term and was given a six-month sentence suspended for 18 months and ordered to do 150 hours community service.

He was also ordered to pay £4,500 compensation and £2,000 in costs.

The 25-year-old had faced up to three years in prison after being convicted for his part in a brawl at a petrol station in Guildford.

The court heard during a nine-day trial how the pop star had sparked the fight after becoming angry when two teenage girls 'disrespected' him by refusing to get into his car to go to a party at his recording studios.

Brian Stork, prosecuting, said 
Dappy called Grace Cochran and Serena Burton, both 19, 'sluts' after they refused his advances and called him 'boring'.

David 
Jenkins, who had been talking to the two women, stepped in to protect 
them but was spat at by Dappy.

When Mr Jenkins put Dappy in a 
headlock, his friends Kieran Vassell and Alfred Miller joined the fight.

Mr Jenkins was left with several broken
teeth while another man, Oliver Billson, suffered a 
swollen eye and a third, Christopher Gibson, suffered a broken nose.

Dappy denied attempting to pick up the two women and told the court that he only spoke to them to promote his single.

He
denied spitting at them and at Mr Jenkins and said his following 
actions were simply as self-defence to get out of the headlock.

Vassell denied affray and said he only acted to protect Dappy.

Jailed: Dappy's co-defendants Alfred Miller, left, and Kieran Vassell, right, were sent to prison for 19 months and 14 months respectively

During the trial, Dappy's lawyer argued that Miss Cochran and Miss Burton were 'unreliable witnesses' as they had sent Twitter and BlackBerry (BBM) messages saying they intended to sell their stories to the national newspapers.

Victim: David Jenkins told the court he suffered broken teeth after being punched during the fight

Miss Burton also sent a message saying that she could not remember what happened and that she would "b*******' when she gave evidence.

The court was told that Dappy had previous convictions for assault and possessing a bladed weapon.

Paul Greaney, defending Dappy, said a prison term would bring an end to his career as a singer.

He said: 'It is inevitable now that he will not be able to visit or work in America.

'Furthermore, as a result of the convictions, certain important radio stations will not play his records.

'His earning capacity now is extremely limited and those responsible for his management believe a period of custody will bring his career to an end.'

He added: 'People depend on Mr 
Contostavlos, I mention not only his family, his mother and brother and 
his partner and children but a number of people who work for him.

'He
is terrified, in particular, not of what will happen to him but that he
will not be able to provide financially for his family and others. That
is a genuine concern he has expressed to me.'

He
continued: 'These proceedings have had a quite massive impact on Mr 
Contostavlos and the court would be entitled to conclude that he has 
learned a very important lesson indeed and he has shown real insight 
into the impact on his victims of his behaviour that night.'

Relieved: The singer broke down in tears and shouted 'Yes' as he found out he would not be jailed

Pleading: Dappy's lawyer said if he was jailed his career as a rapper would be over

Praying as the verdict was announced, Dappy, wearing a white shirt and black tie, broke down in tears and shouted 'Yes' as Judge Neil Stewart announced that the prison term would be suspended.

He was ordered to pay compensation of £2,000 to Mr Jenkins, £1,500 to Mr Gibson and £1,500 to Mr Billson and was also ordered to pay £2,000 towards court costs.

Judge Stewart told Dappy he had spared him an immediate prison term because of his remorse at his actions.

He said: 'The report I have on you suggests you do not present overtly criminal attitudes and this offence has been a wake-up call for you.'

He added: 'Spitting at someone is a repulsive action and is more serious because you have done something similar in the past.

'Even on that aggravation, the offence would not be so serious as to merit a prison sentence.

'It is clear that this spitting triggered these events that culminated in the affray but was not part of the affray.'

The judge added: 'The sentence I have decided on is not affected by any consideration of whether a person is well-known to the public.'

Witnesses: The fight was sparked after Grace Cochran, right, and Serena Burton, left, refused Dappy's advances at a petrol station in Guildford

Brawl: The victims were left with facial injuries including missing teeth and a broken nose after the fight

Vassell, 25, of Hammersmith, west London, was also found guilty at trial of affray and was jailed for 14 months, ordered to pay £1,500 compensation and £500 costs.

Judge Stewart said his actions were so serious that they could only be punished by a prison sentence.

The court heard that Vassell had several previous convictions for supplying class A drugs and was also jailed for nine months in 2010 for theft of a car and dangerous driving.

Miller, 28, a songwriter, of Brentford, west London, pleaded guilty to affray and was sentenced to 19 months imprisonment and ordered to pay £4,500 compensation and £1,000 costs.

Sentencing Miller, Judge Stewart said: 'You used the greatest violence in the incident.

'Nothing other than an immediate period of custody can be justified'.

The court heard he had previous convictions for possessing an offensive weapon, burglary and racially aggravated harassment.

A fourth defendant, Kalonji Stewart, 32, of Harborne, Birmingham, was found not guilty at the trial of affray.

Speaking outside court Detective Constable Alex Boxall, of Surrey Police, said: 'I hope the sentencing today of Dino Costas Contostalvos demonstrates that he will be making amends in public for his actions nearly a year ago on the forecourt of a petrol station in Guildford which left three men suffering serious facial injuries.

'He is a popular rapper who commands a large following and as a high profile musician in the public eye, it is important that the public see that there are consequences for anyone who demonstrates this type of aggressive behaviour and the sentencing today follows a robust investigation to find those responsible and bring them to justice.'

Nigel Knight from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'This case involved a violent attack on three young men on a night out, who were admirably attempting to protect two girls they had just met.

'Anyone in the situation these victims found themselves in would have feared for their own safety. Unable to defend themselves, they were left with numerous injuries as a result of a gratuitous attack.'

Outside court Dappy, wearing a black and white baseball jacket, stopped to share a hug with tearful fans before he was driven away in a black BMW car with blackened windows.

As he drove off, one girl screamed: 'I love you Dappy'.
