Public health officials in Sacramento, California, are dealing with an Ebola scare today after a patient who had recently been to West Africa checked into a local hospital.

The University of California-Davis Medical Center says the patient is suffering from Ebola-like symptoms and that the hospital has activated its Ebola response team.

The patient checked in at Mercy General Hospital in Sacramento on Thursday complaining of 'symptoms consistent with Ebola infection.'

The first signs of Ebola infection often include a fever and vomiting. 

The patient was transferred from Mercy General to the UC-Davis Medical Center, which is one of four hospitals in California designated as an Ebola treatment site by the Centers for Disease Control. 

A hospital spokesman told KTXL-TV that officials would not ave activated the 'Ebola response team' unless that patient had been to a country with active cases of Ebola.

Mercy General closed its emergency room on Wednesday to give it a full scrub-down after the patient was there.

Health officials have emphasized that the patient is at low risk for Ebola. 

Health officials have categorized this Ebola scare as 'low risk'

The disease is still spreading through Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone - though infection rates have slowed in recent months. 

It could take several days before the results of the Ebola test are known. Test results sooner than that could result in a false-negative.

More than 8,800 people have died in the outbreak and 22,000 have been infected. 

Ten people have been treated for Ebola in the United States and two have died. Five Americans and a Sierra Leonian national have been flown to the US with Ebola. Four others were diagnosed in the country - including Liberian national Eric Garner and two nurses who treated him.
