Neymar was snapped posing on a motorbike as the Brazilian forward continued his recovery from injury.

The 22-year-old missed Barcelona's opening game of the season after picking up an ankle knock in training.

The former Santos star sustained a back injury in Brazil that ended his World Cup but he did make his return for Barcelona during their pre-season.

However, fans will have to wait a little longer before seeing Neymar linking up with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez, who returns from his suspension in October.

Barcelona beat Elche 3-0 in their opening game of the season. A Lionel Messi brace was intersected with a goal from youngster Munir El Haddadi, while Javier Mascherano was sent off.

That didn't stop Barcelona offering Mascherano a new contract though, with the 30-year-old now tied down until 2018.
