 An eco-friendly chip shop boss has used his loaf to come up with a novel way of cutting down on litter - by serving all of his meals in bread.

John Clarkson, 55, wanted to come up with 100 per cent recyclable, litter-free packaging after becoming tired of seeing paper trays flying around outside his shop.

And it was after punters kept asking for a bread bun with their chips that his  idea became a reality and he decided to make the packaging edible.

For £1 extra customers can eat the container their food is served in - a full half loaf of white bread - at Mister Eaters Eating Emporium in Preston, Lancs.

Now John and his customers are both happy as they get more food for their money and leave no mess afterwards.

The idea is said to be going down a treat at the popular chip shop with fish and chips, sausage and chips, and pie, chips and gravy all being gobbled from the loaves.

Mr Clarkson said he initially had the idea after a trip to Durban, South Africa, where he sampled bunny chow - a popular fast food consisting of a hollowed-out loaf of bread filled with curry.

So when he was looking for a recyclable alternative to the usual plastic trays and chips in newspaper, he had the perfect idea. 

Using your loaf: Mister Eaters chip shop in Preston, Lancashire, has come up with a novel way of cutting down on litter, by serving all of his meals in bread for an £1 extra.

 He said: 'People normally buy their meal and a barm which is an extra 55p, so for an extra £1 they're getting half a loaf.

'It's been quite funny to see people walking around in the street with a loaf of bread filled with chips, instead of a tray, but it's certainly meant less mess. It's that big a lot of people have been saying it's a 'bready meal for two'.'

'What's more, the cook says that if the meal proves too much for customers but they still miss the bin - it means peckish pigeons can grab a feast. It's eco-friendly and it's a bit of a novelty, so it's going down a storm.' 

The pioneering cook says his creation at Mister Eaters Eating Emporium in Preston, Lancashire is popular with customers and cuts down on rubbish outside his shop
