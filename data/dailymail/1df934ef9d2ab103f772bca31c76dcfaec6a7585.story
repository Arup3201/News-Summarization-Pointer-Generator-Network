The Manchester derby is one of the fiercest rivalries in world football.

Despite their struggles this season, City and United are among the biggest clubs in the country and there will be hundreds of millions of pounds worth of talent on show at the Etihad Stadium.

But who has the better players? Does red or blue come out on top when their stars are judged by Sportsmail's High Court?

The likely line-ups for Manchester City against United on Sunday

Goalkeeper:  Joe Hart vs David de Gea

The Manchester United goalkeeper has established himself as one of the best stoppers in the Barclays Premier League. He has transformed from the lightweight youngster who joined the club to a heavyweight of the side who is often relied upon to keep them in matches. Manchester City's Joe Hart, in comparison, is too prone to mistakes and his position in the team is all-too often questioned. 

VERDICT: Hart 8/10 De Gea 9

David de Gea has enjoyed a fine start to the season in goal for Manchester United

Right back: Pablo Zabaleta vs Rafael

Zabaleta is one of the best full backs in the world, tirelessly running up and down that flank all game. He is almost as important to City's attack as he is their defence. Rafael, however, is is a liability at right back for United.

VERDICT: Zabaleta 8 Rafael 6

Centre back: Vincent Kompany vs Chris Smalling 

Neither defence has covered themselves in glory this season, with City conceding too many soft goals, but United's centre of defence has been terrible for much of the season. Kompany is much better than Smalling, that's all there is to it.

VERDICT: Kompany 9 Smalling 6 

Vincent Kompany is the leader of City's defence, even if he is not quite at his imperious best

Centre back: Martin Demichelis vs Marcos Rojo

Demichelis was a liability for part of last season but rallied and is now seen as a safe option at the heart of City's defence. Rojo is a better full back than a centre half and seems to struggle with the physicality of the Premier League.

VERDICT: Demichelis 7 Rojo 6

Martin Demichelis (left) has turned his City career around but compatriot Marcos Rojo seems lightweight

Left back: Gael Clichy vs Luke Shaw

Shaw has had a troubled start to his career at United, struggling for fitness and with injury, but since he has got back into the side he is starting to find the form that made him the best young full back in the country. City's Gael Clichy has looked slow and off-the-pace recently, and lacks the ability of Shaw even when fully fit.

VERDICT: Clichy 7 Shaw 8 

Gael Clichy is beaten in the air by Sakho and has looked off the pace this season

Midfielder: Fernando vs Daley Blind 

Blind, at United, can seemingly play anywhere but is making a strong case for being a regular holding midfielder. He can screen the back four as well as join the attack to do damage to opponents. Fernando seems to have struggled a bit since his arrival at City.

VERDICT: Fernando 7 Blind 8

Fernando seems to have struggled since arriving at City but Daley Blind (right) is United's midfield screen

Midfielder: James Milner vs Michael Carrick

Milner has had a very good start to the season and has been rewarded with starts in the majority of City's matches. His energy is very useful to Pellegrini. This would be Carrick's first match of the season but when he's on form he makes United tick. 

VERDICT: Milner 7 Carrick 7

Midfielder: Yaya Toure vs Marouane Fellaini 

The battle of the big men in midfield. Even if he is well off his usual form this season, Toure is one of the league's powerhouses and there is always the potential for a goal from nowhere. Fellaini seems to have turned a corner after his goal at West Brom and lung-busting performance against Chelsea. Toure is still his better, however.

VERDICT: Toure 8 Fellaini 7 

Yaya Toure has been below par this season but can still dominate the midfield

Attacking midfielder: Samir Nasri vs Angel di Maria

The Argentine has been played on either flank for United and creates magic with that left foot. Although what he produces is no illusion – he can pick out a man with a pass or score from virtually anywhere and his pace can take him away from opponents. Nasri is more of a touch player and sometimes seems to go missing - but can also produce a goal or a pass from nothing.

VERDICT: Nasri 8 Di Maria 9  

Samir Nasri (right) is City's creative spark and will hope to unlock the United defence

Angel di Maria can create chances from set-pieces and in open play and will be vital for United

Striker: Edin Dzeko vs Robin van Persie

Both cost more than £25m but are their club's secondary striker. Neither centre forward has fired this season - Dzeko has scored just twice in the Premier League (although one was a beauty at Hull) and Van Persie has looked off-colour since the World Cup, although United will hope the last-gasp equaliser against Chelsea will galvanise the Dutchman.

VERDICT: Dzeko 7 Van Persie 8 

Edin Dzeko has failed to fire this season for City and was in the side that lost against Newcastle

Robin van Persie (right) slams in the equaliser against Chelsea and United hope there will be many more

Striker: Sergio Aguero vs Wayne Rooney

Now on to the talismanic centre forwards. Aguero's record this season speaks for itself: 11 goals in 13 games in all competitions, eight goals in his last seven, joint-top scorer in the Premier League with nine. Although less prolific this season, Rooney will be champing at the bit after his three-match suspension and will lead United's attack

VERDICT: Aguero 9 Rooney 8
