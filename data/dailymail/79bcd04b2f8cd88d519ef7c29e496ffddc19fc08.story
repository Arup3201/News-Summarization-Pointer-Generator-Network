His team mates probably love him during the geography round of a pub quiz... but you won't find his long-suffering wife sharing their enthusiasm.

Guinness Rishi, 70, from Delhi, is covered in the flags of 305 different countries, 185 country maps, 165 mini flags and 2,985 characters.

His wife, Bimla, finally persuaded him to stop after convincing Guinness that no one else would want to break his world record - which officially stands at his 2009 total of 220 flag tattoos.

'I've beaten my own record and will invite the adjudicators to come update their books, so that my new total is recognised through the years,' said Guinness, who changed his name from Har Prakash when he set out to break as many world records as possible five years ago.

Mr Rishi's commitment to breaking records means 
he might find it hard to resist having the most tattoo artists working 
on him at the same time

His 22 records include such singular feats as making the longest will in the world - a whopping 489 pages, delivering a pizza from New Delhi to San Francisco, and, of course, carrying the highest number of tattoos on his body.

Guinness's wife Bimla is so angered by her husband's attention-seeking that she refuses to go to the market or be seen in public with him.

'I want to be remembered after I die,' said Mr Rishi.

'But my wife is angry at me for getting so many tattoos and that is why she threatens to have nothing to do with me.

'I have not finished yet and am simply looking for a new record I can break.'

Mr Rishi now plans to break another record - as the world's worst political candidate. 

With hundreds of flags tattooed on his face and body and a scary mannequin head as his only assistant, Mr Rishi looks a strong contender for world's most unelectable politician. 

He is contesting local municipal elections in an attempt to create a world record by not receiving a single vote. 

But Mr Rishi's wife is so angered by her husband's attention-seeking that she has threatened to scupper his plans to win another world record, by voting FOR him.

Mr Rishi's other records include 'taking on the world's oldest adoptee', after he legally took custody of his 61-year-old brother-in-law, and building the tallest sugar cube tower in the world, which stood at 64 inches.

Incredibly, the committed record-breaker also had all his teeth extracted so he could fill his mouth with 750 straws.

'People call me a joker, a madman. It doesn't bother me,' said Guinness.

'My dream is to go around the world several times. I want the children of those countries to ask me, where is the flag of our country, spot it and then, in the process, become aware of my country and other countries as well.

'In fact, I am donating my body to the Ripley's Believe It Or Not museum, so that they preserve it and put in on display.'

To win support for his bid to preserve his body on public display Guinness even has a tattoo on his forehead bearing the legend, Ripley's Believe It Or Not.

And it seems his days of getting inked may not be completely over - Guinness simply confirms he has enough flags on his body.

His commitment to breaking records means he might find it hard to resist having the most tattoo artists working on him at the same time.

'The record is held by an American who in 1996 had 22 artists work on him,' he says. 'As a matter of fact, I did break the record in Pattaya last year when 25 artists etched 55 flags on me. But I was not familiar with the rules and forgot to make a video recording.'

While his forehead, head, arms, legs and chest are covered with tattoos, his back remains pristine clear.

'I am saving that for a dream project,' said Guinness. 'It's going to be the hall of fame for world record holding tattoo artists. I will have all their names and achievements tattooed on my back.'
