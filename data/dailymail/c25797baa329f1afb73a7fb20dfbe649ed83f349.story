A Brisbane mother-of-one’s hopes of ever having another child have been destroyed after she almost lost her life from being accidentally given a spoonful of oven cleaner.

Amanda Merrifield, from Runaway Bay in Queensland, has not eaten a meal in 15 months since coming out of a three-day-coma and enduring 37 operations to help clear her destroyed tongue, throat and oesophagus.

As if feeding through a tube for the rest of her life wasn’t enough – the 40-year-old also had to face the heartbreaking news that being fed commercial oven cleaner by mistake meant she can never have another child.

‘That was taken away from me – it wasn’t my choice it was somebody who ripped that away,’ she said about the night she ingested the corrosive substance at the Point Restaurant at Paradise Point on May 30 last year.

Ms Merrifield labelled the restaurant owner as a 'coward' for not apologising for ruining her life and she had also not received a cent from his insurance company

'Instantly, instantly I don't know how to explain it. If you've ever been shot it was like an instantaneous pain like you would not believe,' Mrs Merrifield told A Current Affair.

She said restaurant manager Paul Jeynes gave her the cleaning product, which he thought was vinegar, to help cure her hiccups.

'He gave it to me and said "here you go – down the hatch" and I hesitated a bit and then I was like oh ok you know, so I took it straight down - swallowed it all in one.'

She labelled Mr Jeynes as a 'coward' for not apologising for ruining her life and she had also not received a cent from his insurance company.

'I just think they're waiting for me to die – they are just pushing paper around,' she said.

'Everybody is shocked - they can't believe that essentially it's just, you know, business as usual.'

Mr Jeynes' insurance company, Lumley, has accepted indemnity on behalf of their client for this 'unfortunate event' and are working to 'settle as quickly as possible'.

Ms Merrifield said that her insides were so badly burned from the oven cleaner that doctors did not expect her to survive the night.

'It damaged everything — my tongue, my voice box, all the way down and stopped at the top of my stomach,' she said.

'I heard one of the doctors say to another "I heard it's really bad" and she said "it's catastrophic" and then said "72 hours".'

The 40-year-old has been forced to leave her career as a lawyer behind and fork out over $100,000 for her medical bills, while having to rely on a full-time carer for her three-year-old son

She has also been left unable to eat and relies on liquid bags of food that cost over $500 a week

'Instantly, instantly I don't know how to explain it. If you've ever been shot it was like an instantaneous pain like you would not believe,' Mrs Merrifield said

Ms Merrifield has been forced to leave her career as a lawyer behind and fork out at least $150,000 for her medical bills, while having to rely on a full-time carer for her three-year-old son.

But it was her son that pulled her out of the coma three days later.

'That’s when I was thinking of my little boy - I was thinking 'he needs me, he needs his mum', she said. 'I remember just mentally going – "you’ve just go to fight – you're not going to die like this'.'

However, choosing to live has cost her a lifetime of unbearable pain and a financial cost of $1,000 per week for medication and liquid food.

'You have to go to another place in your mind because the pain is so bad that you would do anything to get away from it,' she explained.

'I have the feeding tube so that is like my main back up nutrition – that’s what has kept me alive.'

The restaurant's insurance company is yet to pay out Mrs Merrifield's compensation claim despite the restaurant and it's owner, Paul Jeynes (pictured), admitting liability
