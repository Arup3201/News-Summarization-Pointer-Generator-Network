Rechargeable bulbs that use nothing but sunlight could help bring lighting to areas with little or no access to electricity.

Nokero's $15 (£9) Nokero N200 solar bulb recharges even in poor weather and lasts for six hours on a full charge.

It has been designed for areas where there is limited or no electricity, but can also be used for camping trips or during power cuts.

The bulb lasts for more than six hours following a day’s charge in low light, and this charging time drops to four-hours when used in bright sunlight

 The N200 is a follow-up to the Denver-based firm’s N100 bulb, and the second-generation model won the 2013 USPTO Patents for Humanity Awards.

Earlier this week, a Deutsche Bank study claimed solar prices are falling at a rate at which they will undercut prices for conventional energy sources such as coal and oil by 2016.

The study is based on the assumption that the US government will keep its 30 per cent tax credit for solar in place.

However, it added prices are likely to reach the lower level, even if this credit was dropped to 10 per cent.

The report added that because solar is a technology, not a fuel, its price will continue to fall as the technology is made more efficient. 

The awards are aimed at rewarding innovations that use patented technologies to address humanitarian needs.

Brightness-wise, the bulbs are not designed to replace electric versions, but instead are on par with kerosene lamps and similar devices used in poor areas.

On its highest setting, the N200 reaches 13.5 lumens, compared to 850 lumens for a 60-watt bulb.

It takes around a day to charge the N200 in low light, but this charging time drops to four hours in bright sunlight.

The waterproof N200 is slightly larger than a traditional bulb, and it is fitted to a chrome-plated steel loop.

This can be swivelled to face the sun using a single solar cell, and the power is distributed across four LEDs.

Solar power is stored in a  1,000 mAh Ni-MH battery, which the firm claims will last for two years, and can be replaced for $1 (63p). Each bulb costs $15 (£9).

A power-saving mode also means the bulb will only shine when light falls below 200 lux - the equivalent to lighting on a cloudy, stormy day.

Earlier this week, a Deutsche Bank study claimed solar prices are falling at a rate at which they will soon undercut prices for conventional energy sources such as coal and oil.

The study is based on the assumption that the US government will keep its 30 per cent tax credit for solar in place.
