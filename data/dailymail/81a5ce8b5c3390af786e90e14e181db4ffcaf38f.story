Nearly two weeks after a gunman killed six people in a
horrific Sikh temple shooting, authorities are exploring possible links between
the massacre and another pair of murders - more than 2,000 miles away.

Authorities are looking into the possibility that the shooting rampage at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin may be connected to the unsolved killing of two Sikhs in Elk Grove, California, last year.

Surinder Singh and Gurmej Atwal, friends who were both from
Punjab, India, were walking together in Elk Grove on March 4 when they were
shot by an unknown gunman.

Murdered: Surinder Singh and Gurmej Atwal were gunned down as they walked together in Elk Grove, California, on March 4, 2011

Connection?: Police in California are looking for a possible link between temple shooter Wade Michael Page, who played guitar in a band called End Apathy, and the California murders

Cops are looking for a gold or tan pickup truck in
connection to the killings, and a reward for any information leading to a
conviction in the case has reached $57,301.

While leads and other tips continue to pour in, police say
they are no closer to identifying a suspect or making an arrest in what was
classified as a possible hate crime.

That was until the senseless killing of six Sikh worshippers
at the temple in Cudahy, Wisconsin, when Wade Michael Page, neo-Nazi who played
guitar in a white-power band called End Apathy.

Elk Grove Police Detective Kevin Papineau told the
Sacramento Bee: 'I hope it produces the break we need.'

Gunman: Page was given a general 
discharge from the army in October 1998 and had been demoted from 
sergeant to specialist during his service. He was deemed ineligible for 
re-enlistment

Fears: Armed police investigate the Sikh Temple where it was initially believed that there was more than one gunman

Det Papineau admitted that the possibility that the cases
are linked seems remote, but ‘I haven’t ruled it out.’

Based on shell casings discovered at the scene of the Elk
Grove shooting, investigators determined that Singh and Atwal were shot by a
semi-automatic or assault weapon.

Page used a semi-automatic handgun in the Temple massacre,
but it is not yet known if Page had visited California last year.

Papineau told the Sacramento Bee that Elk Grove police are
working with authorities in Wisconsin, but 'obviously they've got their hands
full.'

Page killed himself after exchanging gunfire with heroic cop
Lt Brian Murphy, who was the first officer to the scene.

Response: After exchanging gunfire with a police officer, Page shot himself

Gunman: Page, a former soldier, was said
to be a frustrated neo-Nazi who had been the leader of a racist 
white-power band

Lt Murphy, who was shot eight times, is currently recovering
at a nearby hospital.

Page, who was kicked out of the army in 1998 when he worked
at Fort Bragg in Psychological Operations, gave an interview two years ago to
white supremacist website Label 56, telling them that he started the band End
Apathy because of his wish to 'figure out how to end people's apathetic ways
and start moving forward'.

The six victims - aged between 39 and 84 - have been
identified as Bhai Seeta Singh, 41, Bhai Parkash Singh, 39, Bhai Ranjit Singh,
49, Satwant Singh Kaleka, 62, Subegh Singh, 84, Parmjit Kaur Toor, 41.

Page was given a less-than-honourable discharge in October 1998
following a 'pattern of misconduct' including being drunk on duty and going
AWOL.

Victim: The president of the temple, Satwant Kaleka, was shot by the gunman as he tried to tackle him to the floor with a knife

Loss: Mohan Singh Khatra, who lost his uncle Subeg Singh Khatra, 84, right, in the Wisconsin Sikh shootings, speaks to the media outside the Sikh Cultural Society in Queens, New York

Loss: Siblings Harinder Kaur Rakhra, left, Amarjit Singh Kaleka, center, and Jaswinder Kaur pose with family photos of their brother Satwant Singh Kaleka, president of the gurdwara in Wisconsin
