A student who found $100,000 in the toilets he was cleaning at the offices of an Australian television headquarters has been allowed to keep most of the cash after a judge rewarded his honesty.

Chamindu Amarsinghe was working as a janitor in 2011 at the Nine Network's headquarters in Melbourne's Docklands when he discovered the cash while cleaning the ground floor toilets, the Herald Sun reported.

Mr Amarsinghe was unsure at first when he spotted a stash of the distinctive green and yellow Australian $100 and $50 notes in a bin in the bathroom.

Windfall: Chamindu Armasinghe found $100,00 in $50 and $100 notes stashed inside a toilet in an office where he was working as a cleaner. His honesty in reporting the cash find to his supervisor has paid off after a court awarded him the bulk of the money

Best policy: After a student working as a cleaner in the Nine Network's Melbourne Dockland headquarters (above) found a large stash of banknotes in the toilet and no-one claimed the money, a judge awarded him $80,000 which investigating police said was a just  reward for Chamindu Armarsinghe's honesty

'There was too much to count - I thought someone was playing a prank on me,' he said.'But when I touched the notes - all yellow and green - I realised it was real money.'

When Mr Amarsinghe reported his find to his supervisor, a plumber was called in and retrieved further notes worth $1200 from the pipes, making a total haul from the toilet worth $100,000.

Police were called in, and a man was charged with dealing with the proceeds of crime over the cash, but the charges were dropped.

On Thursday, a Melbourne magistrate ruled Mr Amarsinghe could keep $81,597 of the cash he found, with the balance going to the state, magistrate Michael Smith ruled, saying, 'There’s no reason why such honesty should go unrewarded.'Now an IT student studying in New Zealand, Mr Amarsinghe received a phone call this week telling him the cash was his.

He told the Herald Sun he was 'speechless' about the windfall.

Police approved of the reward. Investigating Detective Senior Constable Daniel Thorne said, 'All the guys in the office felt the same. He’s a struggling student who straight-up didn’t even think of pocketing it.'

Mr Amarsinghe, who is about to start a new life back in Australia, said he would give some of the money to help disabled people.'I’m really, really lucky. I’m not going to waste it,' he said.
