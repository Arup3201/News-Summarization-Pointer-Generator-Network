A lorry driver admitted killing a four-year-old girl when his 44-tonne lorry ploughed into the back of a family car in a motorway accident.

Robert Booth, 64, was driving his HGV at its maximum speed of 55mph seconds before he smashed into stationary traffic on the M6 motorway near Coleshill, Warwickshire.

His lorry collided with a Vauxhall Zafira, sending it careering across the road into a concrete barrier on the hard shoulder, leaving Priyanka Bhogal, of Coventry, West Midlands, with fatal head injuries.

Seven other people were also injured in the crash between Junctions 4a and 4 of the southbound M6 at 12:25am on November 27, 2011- which saw the motorway closed for more than six hours.

Booth, of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, initially denied causing death by dangerous driving, claiming he suffered from sleep apnea syndrome, which meant he was asleep at the time of the crash.

But he later changed his plea to guilty when he appeared at Warwick Crown Court.

The brightly-lit signs also instructed drivers to move from the inside lane to the middle lane in order to avoid the accident - which Booth also allegedly ignored.

Prosecutor Nigel Wilkins said he paid ‘no attention’ to the signs or the brake lights ahead of him.

He said: ‘It was night time and at the time Mr Booth was driving a heavy goods vehicle, it was an articulated lorry. Also on that stretch of motorway were Mr and Mrs Bhogal.

‘They were travelling in a Vauxhall Zafira, a people type carrier, and in that vehicle were their children including Priyanka. She was sitting in the rearmost near side seat.

Scene: Seven other people were also injured in the crash between Junctions 4a and 4 of the southbound M6 at 12:25am on November 27, 2011- which saw the motorway closed for more than six hours (file picture)

‘The defendant drove into the rear of that vehicle and as a result of him colliding with that vehicle it was pushed into a barrier at the side of the road.

‘And tragically the four-year-old child Priyanka, despite being taken to hospital with injuries, died later that same morning of effectively a serious head injury which was caused by that collision.

'Mr Booth did not take any action as a result of the gantry signs warning him of what was up ahead. We know the young girl died and the cause of death was the collision which the prosecution say Mr Booth caused'

Nigel Wilkins, prosecuting

‘Along that stretch of road on that day there had been another incident, I believe it was some sort of minor accident but it had caused a build up in the M6 itself.

‘Because of that incident the relevant gantries were being displayed to both control the speed of traffic and to warn traffic of the problem ahead.

‘There was a 40mph speed limit being shown to traffic and the gantries were showing that a lane ahead was closed and for traffic to move from lane one to lane two when safe to do so.

‘Mr Booth did not take any action as a result of the gantry signs warning him of what was up ahead. We know the young girl died and the cause of death was the collision which the prosecution say Mr Booth caused.’

Trial: Warwick Crown Court (pictured) heard Booth ignored several signs on overhead motorway gantries warning of a minor collision further ahead and ordering them to drive at a maximum of 40mph

The court heard the Bhogal family had been driving home to Coventry after a family member's 40th birthday party the day before in Walsall, West Midlands.

In a statement, Priyanka’s mother Baljit Bhogal, who was driving, said: ‘We left the party at about 11.30pm. I know Priyanka was wearing her seatbelt. Priyanka was sitting in her booster seat.

‘I looked up in my inside mirror and then
I heard a screeching from behind. I saw a lorry coming up very quickly 
behind me in lane two.

'I could see a bead of blood on her forehead and her eyes were partly open. She appeared to have no soul left in her'

Joginder Bhogal, father of Priyanka

‘I knew I needed to get away from it so I steered to the left to get away from the lorry.  Within seconds of seeing this lorry it hit our car from behind pushing our car off the road into the barrier.

‘I went to Priyanka first, I held her head for a bit and said Priyanka. She did not say anything, she just fell forward. I continued holding Priyanka's head through the back of the smashed window.

‘Two women came up to me and took me away from the scene. I was taken to hospital and the doctors told me Priyanka had died.’

Priyanka's father, Joginder Bhogal, added: ‘I could see a bead of blood on her forehead and her eyes were partly open. She appeared to have no soul left in her.’

Tachograph records from Booth's lorry were analysed and showed police he was travelling at his maximum speed of 55mph.

Booth was bailed and ordered to return to court on February 25 for sentencing
