Many scientists believe it’s only a matter of time before we find an Earth 2.0 – a theorised planet much like our own.

Now one astronomer has put a date on it. Dr Franck Marchis, who works for the SETI Institute, believes we may find a planet like our own by 2024.

His prediction is based on recent advances in technology that have allowed scientists to capture images of planets and their orbiting stars up to 63 light years away. 

Dr Franck Marchis, who works for the SETI Institute, believes we may find a planet like our own by 2024. Pictured here is  Kepler-20f exoplanet. This Earth-sized planet is found in the constellation Lyra

Namely, the Gemini Planet Imager, which last week took an image of a 10-million-year-old planet named Beta Pictorus b from 370 trillion miles away.

Gemini has been under development for nearly a decade, but this was the first image to be released by the instrument.

‘The search for Earth-like planets, the search for an Earth 2.0 is very close,’ said Dr Franck Marchis works for the SETI Institute in an interview with Brett Brownell from Mother Jones.

‘I think in 10 or 15 years we will have an Earth 2.0 candidate.’

Gemini Planet Imager's first light image of Beta Pictoris b, a planet orbiting the star Beta Pictoris. The star, Beta Pictoris, is blocked in this image by a mask so its light doesn't interfere with the light of the planet. Beta Pictoris b is a giant planet - several times larger than Jupiter - and is approximately ten million years old

The Gemini Planet Imager is the world's most advanced planet hunting instrument built for the Gemini Telescope in Chile.

It
 is designed to image extrasolar planets orbiting nearby stars. In 2011,
 the GPI Exoplanet Survey team was selected to carry out an 890-hour 
survey campaign from 2014 to 2016 to search and characterise exoplanets 
around 600 stars.

GPI, which is the size of a small car, 
detects infrared radiation from young Jupiter-like planets in wide 
orbits around other stars, equivalent to the giant planets in our own solar system not long after their formation.

It
 does this using silicon microchip deformable mirrors to remove 
atmospheric turbulence, and something known as coronagraphic masks - a 
telescopic attachment designed to block out the direct light from a star
 so that nearby objects.

Scientists claim Gemini is the most advanced such instrument to be deployed on one of the world’s biggest telescopes – the eight-metre Gemini South telescope in Chile.

‘Even these early first-light images are almost a factor of 10 better than the previous generation of instruments,’ said Bruce Macintosh of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who led the team that built the instrument.

‘This is the grail of modern astronomy,’ Dr Marchis told Mother Jones. ‘We're trying desperately now to image those planets because we know they exist.

‘When you observe a planet with [the now defunct telescope] Kepler, what you've been doing is basically detecting the transit - the attenuation of [the star's] light - due to the planet passing between us and the star.

‘Now with GPI, the Gemini Planet Imager, which is mounted at the eight meter class telescope in Chile we're going to be able to see the planet itself.’

Data from the Kepler telescope suggests that one in every five sun-like stars in the Milky Way may have an Earth-sized planet circling it in the Goldilocks zone - an area where liquid water could exist.

But researchers recently suggested the figure could be even higher. Scientists in Scotland last week announced that Earth-sized planets can support life at least ten times further away from stars than previously thought.

This means that cold rocky planets previously considered uninhabitable may be teeming with life beneath the surface.

Dr Marchis believes GPI will be able to provide a clearer picture of exactly which planets are habitable.

‘This is the first light data. So it's not perfect. It looks impressive but I'm telling you: in six months it's going to be even more impressive,’ said Dr Marchis.

He added that there are currently some issues with the instrument. It's new, and so has to be tuned to perform better.

‘Imagine one day, we're going to be able to see seasonal effects on these planets and be able to see if there is a biosphere,’ he said.
