A second baby fed with a contaminated hospital drip died today - although officials believe it may not have been poisoned.

The unnamed newborn was one of 22 babies being cared for amid fears they had or might developed blood poisoning at neonatal intensive care units in England.

Nine-day-old Yousef Al-Kharboush died on June 1 after contracting a bacterial infection at St Thomas' Hospital in London.

The 
contaminated products supplied by London-based pharmaceutical firm ITH 
Pharma had been sent to a total of 22 hospitals.

New tragedy: A second baby fed on a contaminated drip died today, ten days after nine-day-old Yousef Al-Kharboush died in the premature unit at St Thomas' Hospital in London

In
 a statement Public Health England, who is investigating, said: 'Another
 baby has sadly died but this does not appear to be related to the 
bacillus cereus infection'.

Details
 of the hospital the baby was in when the death occurred cannot be 
released for confidentiality reasons, a PHE spokesman said.

But it is 
known that cases have been recorded at 10 hospitals across England.

Speaking at a pre-inquest review last week, Yousef's father Raaid Hassan Sakkijha said: 'My son has just died. I don't want more children to.

'I was hoping to hear this product would be completely stopped from production until they make sure that ... no other babies are being contaminated.

'I won't have a baby in the next nine months but I hope other people who have babies will be safe.'

Affected hospitals include Chelsea and
 Westminster NHS Trust, The Whittington Hospital, Brighton & Sussex 
University Hospital NHS Trust and Stoke Mandeville Hospital.

The children were given a batch of a fluid called parenteral nutrition, which is supposed to deliver a variety of nutrients intravenously when a baby is unable to eat on its own.

Professor Mike Catchpole, PHE incident 
director, said investigations suggest liquids in the drips were 
contaminated in one day.

He also confirmed those liquid products are no 
longer in circulation.

'Investigations to date have suggested
 the source of the Bacillus cereus infection that has affected outbreak 
cases was the contamination of intravenous liquid products during a 
single day of production, which are no longer in circulation,' he said.

'PHE
 is continuing to work with the MHRA on this investigation and to ensure
 all possible lessons from this serious incident are identified.'

Upsetting: 11 hospitals in England were affected. The Rosie Hospital based at Addebrooke's in Cambridge now has three cases, a rise from the two investigators had previously linked to the contaminated drips

The PHE said there have been no new infections since June 2. Currently there are 18 confirmed cases of infection, and a further four possible cases.

The supplier of the fluid, London-based pharmaceutical firm ITH Pharma, said last week that the suspected contamination had been traced to a 'sourced' single raw material ingredient.

ITH Pharma managing director Karen Hamling said she was 'deeply saddened' by the death of Yousef Al-Kharboush and illness of other babies.

'As a mother, as a pharmacist , as someone who has worked for 30 years in healthcare, inside and outside the NHS, I am deeply saddened that one baby has died and others have fallen ill from septicaemia,' she said.
