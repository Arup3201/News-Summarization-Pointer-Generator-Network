CLICK HERE to find out why Europe captain Paul McGinley is worried about being favourites at Gleneagles

American Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson has admitted that he will be targeting Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter at Gleneagles next week and telling his team: ‘Take down the big dogs.’

Watson said he would be seeking to take a leaf out of the Europeans’ book, in the manner in which they always received a boost in past matches whenever Tiger Woods was beaten.

‘Of course it gives everyone a lift if players like Rory and Poulter are beaten, and I’ll be telling my players that,’ said the skipper.

Captain Tom Watson aims to go after Europe's 'big dogs' when the USA face Europe in the Ryder Cup

In his last public thoughts before his team leave for Scotland on Monday, Watson defended the format that will see his team travel without their best two players on current form.

Billy Horschel and Chris Kirk performed brilliantly to top the standings at the end of the four-tournament FedEx Cup play-off series on Sunday. McIlroy and Sergio Garcia were among those who expressed ‘relief’ that they would not be part of the opposition team.

But Watson said: ‘The last time I was captain in 1993 I made my picks six weeks before the match and now it is only three weeks, and I think that is about right.

‘Billy was on my radar back in February. I said to him back then: “Come on man, step it up”. But the bottom line is he didn’t perform well enough during the qualifying process.’

Watson also accepted Europe have the strongest team on paper but downplayed any idea his team were underdogs.

‘That’s not in my team’s mind at all,’ said Watson. ‘I believe in this team and I think they believe in themselves.’

Watson singled out McIlroy for particular praise. ‘He’s the best player in the world and that’s a huge plus for them.

‘But the beauty of the Ryder Cup is he can’t win it all by himself.’

As for his own side, he called Rickie Fowler his ‘young stud’ and veteran Jim Furyk a machine. ‘I only wish he could play in every match,’ said Watson of the 44-year-old, whose Ryder Cup record from his 27 matches reads: won 8, lost 15, halved 4.
