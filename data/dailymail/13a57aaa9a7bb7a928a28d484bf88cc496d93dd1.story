It’s one of the world’s most secretive states - and a source of intrigue for millions of outsiders.

Now we have been given an insight into the inner workings of North Korea after Google published a detailed map online - showing gulag labour camps, hotels, hospitals and train networks.

The map was put together by volunteer ‘citizen cartographers’ from outside the country who added road names and points of interest in the country on the Google Map Maker collaborative tool.

Before: This is how the secretive state of North Korea appeared on Google Maps online prior to yesterday

‘We know this map is not perfect,' Google Map Maker’s senior product manager Jayanth Mysore said in a blog post. ‘One of the exciting things about maps is that the world is a constantly changing place.

‘While many people around the globe are fascinated with North Korea, these maps are especially important for the citizens of South Korea who have ancestral connections or still have family there.’

The country had appeared on Google Maps as an almost-completely white space until yesterday, but now it even has train stops in the capital city of Pyongyang, as well as department stores and parks.

Google Maps created diagrams of once-unmapped Afghanistan and Burma with a similar method of volunteers collecting data which was fact-checked by other users, reported the Washington Post.

Many of them used data which was already available online, such as analogue maps and satellite images, volunteer cartographer Hwang Min-woo, 28, of Seoul, South Korea, told the newspaper.

The map gives an insight into the country’s labour camps, with the ‘Hwasong Gulag’ labelled in the North-East of the country, with a street called Gulag 16 Road cutting through the area.

Two train stations called Sangryongban and Ryongdong can be seen at one end of the road, although that is all that has been recorded in the area on Google’s map.

Mr Mysore added: 'Creating maps is a crucial first step towards helping people access more information about parts of the world that are unfamiliar to them.'

Google chairman Eric Schmidt recently visited North Korea and said it has an 'information blackout’.

The map’s publication came as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said North Korea's leader has acted provocatively but she still hopes he can be convinced not to conduct a nuclear test.

Mrs Clinton said the U.S. expected Kim Jong Un would allow more openness and improve the lives of North Koreans - and nations must work closely together on changing the country’s behaviour.
