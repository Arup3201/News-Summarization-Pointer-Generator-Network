The characters and catchphrases are old favourites. But it is a new troop of actors bringing them to the big screen.

Dad’s Army is being made into a feature film nearly 50 years after it first aired.

The roles of Captain Mainwaring and Sergeant Wilson – made famous by Arthur Lowe and John Le Mesurier – will be taken on by Toby Jones, who appeared in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, and Love Actually star Bill Nighy.

They will again be overseeing the motley platoon of volunteers of the Home Guard in the fictitious town of Walmington-on-Sea.

Among them veteran soldier Lance-Corporal Jones, wet Private Godfrey, doom-mongering Private Frazer and the young, deemed infirm Private Pike.

The TV series, which was first broadcast in 1968 and ran until 1977, pulled in 18million viewers at its peak – and two million still tune in to watch repeats.

Jimmy Perry, 90, who came up with the idea for the show and wrote it with David Croft, will be a producer on the film.

The film script has been written by Hamish McColl, who wrote the hit British films Jonny English Reborn and Mr Bean’s Holiday. Director Oliver Parker, who made the two St Trinian’s movies, has also been lined up for the project.

The main producer Damian Jones, whose credits include The Iron Lady and The History Boys, says it was Dad’s Army’s ‘universal appeal’ that had attracted him.

The longevity of the programme’s success has been attributed to the superb cast of supporting characters along with their catchphrases that have stood the test of time.

Jones, who was played by Clive Dunn, had regular lines such as ‘Don’t panic’ and ‘They don’t like it up ’em’, which have become synonymous with the show.

Stuart Wright, chairman of the Dad’s Army museum in Thetford, Norfolk, where the series was filmed, said tours of the town still attracted several thousand visitors a year.

Mr Wright added: ‘David Croft used to point out the jokes were 30 years out of date when the series went out so they have certainly stood the test of time.’ 

A number of the actors from the original series had experienced war. Arnold Ridley, who played Godfrey, had been wounded on the Somme in World War One.

Dunn had spent four years as a German prisoner of war, during the 1940s. The young Private Pike was based on Perry’s experiences as a young member of the Home Guard.

The character of the Scotsman Private Frazer was based partly on that of John  Laurie, the actor who played him. 

He once complained: ‘I have played every major Shakespeare role … And I end up becoming famous for this c**p.’
