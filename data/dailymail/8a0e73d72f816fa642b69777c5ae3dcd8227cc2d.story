A warrant was issued for Everton midfielder Steven Pienaar's arrest today - the day after he scored a dramatic equaliser against Manchester United in a remarkable 4-4 draw.

Premier League star Pienaar, 30, is wanted after his Aston Martin DBS was caught speeding twice on the same road in the space of 11 days.

The footballer failed to let the authorities know who was driving and today failed to appear at Chelmsford Magistrates Court.

A judge issued a warrant and said he should be bailed to appear on a date to be fixed so that he can be sentenced. The charge of failing to notify who was driving was proven in his absence.

Pienaar, on loan at Everton from Spurs, faces a possible driving ban as each offence carries a minimum six penalty points.

Under the totting up procedure anyone who reaches 12 points faces disqualification unless they can show that a ban would cause them exceptional hardship.

His car was caught doing 43mph and 38mph in a 30mph zone in Chigwell, Essex, on October 10 and 21 last year, the court was told.

At the time, Pienaar was playing his football at Tottenham.

As the defendant’s name was called, Chair of the bench, Ian Fuller asked : 'Is that the footballer?' and when told there was a difficulty obtaining driving record because they didn’t have his date of birth, he told the prosecution to 'Google it.'

Pienaar's address was given in court as Epping, Essex.

The footballer yesterday scored a dramatic equaliser for Everton as they came from behind to draw 4-4 at Manchester United - and throw the race for the Premier League title wide open.

Pienaar was given a 12-month ban from the roads in March 2010 after being caught drink-driving.

He was stopped by police after going through a red and was discovered to be almost twice the legal limit.
