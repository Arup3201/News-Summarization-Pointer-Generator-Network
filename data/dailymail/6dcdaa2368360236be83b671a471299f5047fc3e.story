The groom-to-be found himself blindfolded as he stood off a platform in order to perform a bungee jump off a bridge, or so he thought.

The footage shows a man named 'Yvo', from Netherlands, blindfolded during his bachelor party as his friends are egging on and trying to convince him into thinking he's hundreds of feet in the air.

But in reality, the man is standing on a platform just inches above a small pond, surrounded by grass, believed to be in a park.

The groom-to-be found himself blindfolded as he stood off a platform in order to perform a bungee jump off a bridge, or so he thought

As one of his friends  is seen tying the man's ankles together, another friend is grasping on his arm before they assist him to the edge of the ledge.

Yvo, who is wearing a grey t-shirt, denim jeans and brown boots, doesn't sound too impressed  as he is heard swearing while he is seen psyching himself up before the big dive.

While his other friends are heard in the background, yelling out 'bungee jumping' as they laugh that their buck is about to plunge into a pond.

The man in the black top and denim jeans starts yelling into the man's ear, saying: 'Yvo! Listen to me, good?' as Yvo responds 'yeah'.

His friends start building up tension as they take off his headphones while he prepares himself for the biggest jump of his life.

They unlock a metal handcuff from behind the man's back as two male friends are seen holding each of his arms out from his side.

Yvo wasn't given any opportunity to back out of his bungee jump by his so-called friends

Finally, they start a count down before his friends push him from the platform and he hits the water face-first just seconds later

The groom-to-be sees the funny side to the prank and he starts swimming laps around the shallow pond while his friends are still laughing

Yvo quickly takes off his mask as he looks around while his friends are heard laughing hysterically in the background.
