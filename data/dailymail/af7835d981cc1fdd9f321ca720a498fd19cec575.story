Discount designer fashion e-tailer The Outnet is celebrating its fifth birthday in serious style.

The website, which sells designer labels for a fraction of the price, is marking the occasion by giving shoppers the chance to get their hands on an exclusive collection of limited-edition styles without breaking the bank.

The site has worked with 17 of its favorite designers to create an exclusive collection of reissued, limited-edition pieces.

Looking good: To celebrate its fifth birthday, the Outnet has collaborated with its favourite designers to create some limited edition garments. Chanel Iman models a £377 Issa vintage kaftan

From the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite designer, Alexander McQueen, to Preen by Thornton Bregazzi and Balmain, the site say that these are pieces 'you won't be able to find anywhere else'. 

A blue and white printed maxi by Issa - another firm favourite of the Duchess of Cambridge - costs £377; dresses by the designer can often cost as much as £700.

A colourful Preen pencil skirt with on-trend pastel square prints will cost £276, but snapping one up in Harrods could set you back £400.

Who better to call on? The Outnet roped in Chanel Iman to showcase the range, left, Antonio Berradi dress, £383, right, Preen pencil skirt with iconic pastel square print, £276

Striking: Chanel, who is a long-standing Victoria's Secret model, wears £255 Chloé classic wedge sandal

Superstar: Chanel has turned her attentions towards television appearances and has been spotted on shows including America's Next Top Model. Here, she wears £107 Equipment shirt and, right, JW Anderson best-selling paisley print top, £341

And who better to model the high-end garments that supermodel Chanel Iman?

While only 23, Miss Iman is 
considered a veteran of the modelling world, having starred on the cover
 of Vogue and Teen Vogue by the age of 16. She served as a Victoria’s 
Secret Angel from 2010 to 2012.
