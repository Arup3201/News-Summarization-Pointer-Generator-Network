Wesley Sneijder has admitted it would be hard to turn down an offer from Louis van Gaal to join him at Manchester United next season.

Sneijder is currently on World Cup duty with Holland as part of Van Gaal's 23-man World Cup squad and has been heavily linked with a move to the Red Devils over the last few years.

The 30-year-old midfielder revealed he is currently happy with life at Turkish outfit Galatasaray but the lure of playing under Van Gaal could prove too tempting.

‘In the Netherlands, Van Gaal is something like the head teacher of a school. Not everyone is lucky enough to get into his good books,' he said.

‘He trains his players very hard and always expects the highest standards. I am happy at Galatasaray, I have established myself at the club and have settled in.

‘However, if Van Gaal were to make me an offer, I would have to at least consider it. Nobody from the Netherlands can simply reject Van Gaal.’

The former Real Madrid and Inter Milan playmaker starred in Holland's emphatic 5-1 win in their Group B opening win against Spain on Friday and is expected to start in the Dutch's clash against Australia on Wednesday.

Sneidjer's attacking qualities from midfield would be welcomed by the Old Trafford faithful who have been looking for a creative spark since Paul Scholes' retirement.
