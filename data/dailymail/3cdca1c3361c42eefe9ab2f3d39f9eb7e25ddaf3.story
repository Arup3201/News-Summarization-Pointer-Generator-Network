Nathan Lloyd posted an explicit image and video on his former girlfriend's Instagram page and then changed her account password

A jilted boyfriend took revenge on his ex-girlfriend by posting a photograph of her posing in her underwear on her own online account, and changed her password so she could not remove it.

Nathan Lloyd, 22, had been sent the picture of his girlfriend wearing racy underwear when they were still together.

But when she ended their relationship Lloyd logged into her Instagram account and uploaded the picture, and then changed her password. 

Lloyd, of Narberth, West Wales, also posted a video 'of a sexual nature' onto the page, Haverfordwest magistrates court heard. 

Prosecutor Peter Lloyd said: 'When they were together the defendant had access to the victim's Instagram account.

'Lloyd then changed the victim's Instagram password and posted the picture and later a video of a private sexual nature.'

Lloyd admitted breaking the Telecommunications Act by posting the image. He will be sentenced later at Haverfordwest Magistrates' Court.

He was given bail on the condition he did not use any social networking websites before his next court date.

The maximum sentence for the offence, which falls under section 127 of the Communications Act 2003, is six months in prison.

Lloyd's case comes as new legislation is expected to come into force next year that makes revenge porn - a specific offence which could carry a maximum sentence of two years. It is due to be made into law next year.

Yesterday the CPS launched new guidelines on tackling domestic abuse which will include using technology to inflict misery on former partners. Under the new guidance issued prosecutors will be encouraged to consider how revenge porn can be treated as a form of domestic abuse.  

Those convicted of revenge porn – the distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress – could face two years in prison under new laws.

It will be made a specific offence, covering the sharing of images both online and offline, in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, which is currently going through Parliament. 

It will mean that images posted to social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter will be caught by the offence, as well as those that are shared via text message. 

Luke King was jailed  for posting the explicit image

Images shared via email, on a website or the distribution of physical copies will also be caught.

Victims of revenge porn have previously found it difficult to have pictures removed from the internet.

Many sites where the images are hosted are based outside the UK, and requests to remove content are often ignored. In some cases, asking for removal results in more attention being brought to the images.

The move to clamp down on 'revenge porn' came after 149 cases, the vast majority of them involving women victims, were reported over two and a half years. Only six led to prosecutions.

However, the new rules do not affect the consensual 'sexting' of images by under-18s. This is already illegal – but police cannot monitor mobile photo messages. 

Earlier this year Luke King, 21, of Nottingham, became the first person to be jailed for revenge porn offences in the UK. After his three year relationship ended he posted a number of explicit images of his former partner, and changed his WhatsApp icon to one of the images. 

King was eventually prosecuted under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 after he ignored two police warnings not to share the X-rated images and was jailed for 12 weeks.
