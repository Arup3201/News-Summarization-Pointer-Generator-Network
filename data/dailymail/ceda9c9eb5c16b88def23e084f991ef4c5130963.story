Generous Scots are more likely to tip for services than anyone else in Britain – with those living in the North East named the most tight-fisted.

Waiters, taxi drivers, hairdressers and others can rely on a bit extra from customers north of the border but may go empty handed in other areas of the country, a survey revealed.

Only 13 per cent of Scots say they never tip - the lowest proportion of any region and less than half the stingy 35 per cent of Geordies who refuse to leave a gratuity.

The North East is the worst area for workers to get a bit extra from customers, said the survey of 2,000 adults by financial advice service Thinkmoney.

It is followed by exactly one in three in the West Midlands (33 per cent) and 32 per cent in the East Midlands who say they never tip.

But for Scotland it enhances their reputation for generosity fresh from the positive feedback the country got for the overwhelming success of hosting the Commonwealth Games.

49 per cent of Londoners tip 10 - 20 per cent for services with seven per cent leaving a great 20-40 per cent

North East - 35%   

West Mids - 33%

East Mids - 32%

Yorks/Humber - 32%

North West - 29%

East Anglia - 28%

N.Ireland - 27%

South East - 25%

South West - 23%

Wales - 22%

London - 16%

Scotland - 13%

While some areas are reluctant to put their hands in their pocket for low paid workers, just 16 per cent of Londoners refuse to leave a tip.

And the capital is the most generous with 49 per cent leaving between 10 and 20 per cent as a tip and seven per cent giving a massive 20 to 40 per cent.

This may be as a result of London's expensive cost of living where taxi drivers expect a decent tip and low paid workers need more just to afford to live in the capital.

Young people are more generous than older generations with their gratuities, with 88 per cent of 25-34 year olds always leaving a bit extra compared to 70 per cent of the over-55s.

 Those who work in professions where they receive tips are also most likely to give tips - almost half of taxi drivers, waiters and hair stylists always tip others.

Ian Williams of Thinkmoney said: 'A gesture of thanks need not break the bank if tipping is approached sensibly and people only tip what they can genuinely afford.

'But plenty are happy to admit they'd rather not tip at all.'
