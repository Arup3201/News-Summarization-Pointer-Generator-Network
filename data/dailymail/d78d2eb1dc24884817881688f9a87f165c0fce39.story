Charged: Enrique Alberto Machado, from Texas, has been charged with murder over the tragic death of his 13-month-old son, Carlos, on April 27

A baby boy has drowned in the bath tub after his drunken dad who was bathing him fell asleep on the floor, police said.

Enrique Alberto Machado, from Texas, has been charged with felony murder over the tragic death of his 13-month-old son, Carlos Enrique, on April 27.

The 36-year-old truck driver allegedly admitted to police that, before he bathed Carlos, he had driven at least 10 hours from Colorado to Houston, Texas and drank six beers with colleagues.

Machado's girlfriend, Cynthia Veliz, found their son floating face up in the tub at her Houston home and Machado fast asleep about 11am.

'He [Machado] loved his son. I know he really did love him and I really know he never would have wanted this to happen,' Veliz told Digital Journal.

'Nothing is going to take away the pain that I feel.'

Veliz said Machado came over to the house on Sunday morning to visit his son and offered to bathe him.

Veliz then went back to bed and woke up two hours later when the phone rang. When she went to the bathroom, she was horrified to see her little boy's lifeless body in the bath.

'I went in there and I found the father asleep on the little step in the restroom and the baby was floating under the water,' she said, according to Click2Houston.

Veliz pulled the infant out of the tub, woke up Machado and dialed 911. She says Machado tried giving his son CPR but it was too late.

Machado maintains he did not know what happened until his girlfriend woke him up.

Carlos was rushed to the Texas Children's Hospital - West Houston Campus where he was declared dead.

Machado was charged with felony murder after Carlos' death was ruled a homicide and appeared in court on Tuesday for a probable cause hearing.

Prosecutors alleged Machado, from El Salvador, is living illegally in the United States, but his lawyer argued the father is documented and has lived and worked in the Houston area for 20 years.

Bond was set at $100,000, according to Digital Journal.
