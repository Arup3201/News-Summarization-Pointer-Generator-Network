The contestants on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here feasted on ostrich anus and pig's penis casserole during the most dreaded bushtucker trial on this year's ITV show.

But while most of us watched with horror as they tucked into the jungle delicacies, one retailer is convinced we want to get in on the action and has launched a selection of the gruesome grub.

Hawkin's Bazaar is offering scorpion lollies, BBQ flavoured mealworms and salt and vinegar crickets on its website for £4 each.

The new kind of Christmas selection box? Hawkin's Bazaar are offering a £14 Bush Tucker trial set packed with creepy crawlies

For the more daring diner, there is a £14 set which contains a selection of bug lollies and chocolate covered critters.

While the thought of munching on the flavoured bugs may turn your stomach, the UN reports that ‘as a food source, insects are highly nutritious’.

Some species boast almost twice the protein of meat and fish, and in their larvae stage they tend to be rich in fat, vitamins and minerals.

In some cultures, they’re still prized as a delicacy. In Japan, they like to marinate the grubs of the longhorn beetle in soy sauce before grilling them. In Samoa, they feed them on coconut shavings for a few days, then roast them over charcoal wrapped in a banana leaf.

Shona Wilkinson at The Nutri Centre 
said: 'Eating insects is certainly popular in countries such as Thailand
where you can buy them from supermarkets and pick them up from 
road-side stalls. 

'They
are a great source of protein and naturally low in fat, as well as 
essential vitamins such as B1 and B2.

And while it's not something I 
could ever eat, they are thought to soon become the new super trendy 
food due to their nutrient value.

'There are certainly worse, more 
unhealthy things you could eat.'

Good for you? Some species boast almost twice the protein of mainstream meat and fish and are rich in minerals

New foodie trend? Housebites.com has created Mealworm Tacos and Cricket Pad Thai recipes with real edible insects. Both £9.99 and available at Firebox.com

battled it out on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here by eating ostrich 
testicles and creepy crawlies - and now you can do the same

More than 2bn people worldwide already supplement their diet with insects, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation

Bugs are low fat and low calorie: 100g of crickets have 121 calories compared to 288 in the same weight of beef

Common house crickets contain four times as much protein as the same weight of chicken

Cattle require 12 times more feed to produce the same amount of protein as crickets

The correct term for eating insects is entomophagy, from the Greek entomon, for insect, and phagein, to eat
