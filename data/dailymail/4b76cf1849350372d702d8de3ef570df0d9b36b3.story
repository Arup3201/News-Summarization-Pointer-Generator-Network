Garry Monk has promised Swansea will respond in the FA Cup at Blackburn following their Chelsea embarrassment last weekend.

Swansea suffered their worst home defeat for 24 years as Jose Mourinho's Barclays Premier League leaders ran riot to win 5-0 at the Liberty Stadium, but Monk says his players have been impatient for Saturday's fourth-round cup tie at Ewood Park to come around.

'I've been on the end of those results as a player and you can't wait for the next game to come - it doesn't matter if it's a friendly,' Monk said.

'You want to get out on the pitch and put things right.

'The players know the first 45 minutes against Chelsea was unacceptable but we can't make a massive meal about it.

'We've been fantastic this season and we just have to show what we have done in the majority of the games.

'I had a good chat with the players when they came back into training and we will respond at Blackburn.

'Everything we wanted to achieve at the start of the season is still there in our own hands and that's been the message to the players this week.'

Monk knows the value of a good cup run having been part of the Swansea squad which went all the way to Wembley in 2013 and lifted the Capital One Cup.

The former centre-half played the last half-hour as a substitute in the 5-0 final victory over Bradford and is now keen to experience that feeling as a manager.

'I've watched a lot of Blackburn in recent weeks and they're a very good side,' Monk said about opponents who are 10th in the Sky Bet Championship and 21 places below Swansea on the league ladder.

'They'll want to do well at home but we want to put last week right and go on a cup run ourselves.

'We've experienced that already and it's magic to go on a run like that because it creates confidence throughout the whole club and the city.'

Full-back Kyle Naughton could make his Swansea debut after completing his £5million move from Tottenham on Thursday and Monk seems set for a busy end to the January transfer window after confirming his interest in Norwich full-back Martin Olsson and Stuttgart midfielder Alexandru Maxim.

But he admits that he hopes to sort out any business well before the end of the transfer deadline on February 2.

'I like to get any business done and dusted because I don't like leaving it to the last minute - that's why I leave it to the chairman,' Monk said.

'We've spoken about targets and shortlisting them and we'll see whether it's right for the club.

'This period can be good or bad for the club.

'It was a great opportunity for us to sign Kyle but we don't want to lose important players like (Wilfried) Bony.

'It depends who walks in or who walks out whether you have enjoyed the transfer window.'
