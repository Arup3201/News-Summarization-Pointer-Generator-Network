Alberto Nisman (pictured) was discovered dead in his own apartment in January - a day before he was due to testify about his claims

Argentine investigators say they have found a second person's DNA in the apartment where prosecutor who had accused the country's president of a cover up was found dead.

Prosecutor Alberto Nisman had accused President Cristina Fernandez of covering up Iran's alleged role in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish centre in Buenos Aires that left 85 dead. 

Nisman's body was discovered in an apartment in January - a day before he was due to testify about his claim that Fernandez sought to whitewash his findings that Iran was behind the attack on the centre, run by the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association.

Following the DNA find today, Judge Fabiana Palmaghini is calling in a person who visited Nisman the day before his body was found.

The judge's office does not name the witness, but Nisman's aide Diego Lagomarsino has acknowledged visiting him on January 17.

Investigators say they don't yet know if Nisman committed suicide or was killed.

Last week, it was reported that investigators are trying to track down former intelligence chief Antonio Stiusso in connection with Nisman's death, but are unsure if he is even in the country. 

'He was not at any of the properties registered as his own,'
Oscar Parrilli, head of the Intelligence Secretariat (SI), told
reporters. 

Iran has vigorously denied involvement in the bombing and
Fernandez has dismissed Nisman's findings as absurd. 

She said
Nisman was duped by rogue agents involved in a power struggle 
and killed when he was no longer of value to them.

One of those spies was Stiusso, Fernandez's government has
said. Fired during a December shake-up of the SI, Stiusso had
helped Nisman with his investigation of the bombing.

'I have no doubts that Stiusso is behind all this, after the
decision of (President Fernandez) to fire him from the SIDE,'
Anibal Fernandez, the president's chief of staff, said on
Twitter on Tuesday, referring to the top spy agency by its 
former name.

Parrilli said secrecy laws would be lifted so thatinvestigators could grill Stiusso fully about the mysteriousevents leading up to Nisman's death. He said the presidentwanted 'the whole truth to be known.'

Stiusso's spy career spanned four decades. He was one of the
most feared men in the intelligence agency, which played an
important role in the military government's 'dirty war' against
suspected Marxist rebels, union leaders and other leftists in
the 1970s.

Since democracy was restored in 1983, successive governments
are widely believed to have continued to use the agency to snoop
on opponents. 

Stiusso, whose name is often spelled Stiuso in
Argentina, is believed to have been at the heart of its
wiretapping operations.

'(Stiusso) is a key man given his ties to Alberto Nisman,'
Gerardo Young, author of a book titled 'The Secret Argentina' on
the intelligence community, told television channel TN. 

'He knew
perfectly what Nisman had been working on and surely knew of his
state of mind.'

It remains unclear whether Nisman killed himself or was
murdered.

No arrests have been made since Fernandez's remark two weeks
ago that renegade spies were behind the prosecutor's death.

The scandal has dented the government's credibility ahead of
October's presidential election, polls show. Fernandez is barred
from running for a third term.
