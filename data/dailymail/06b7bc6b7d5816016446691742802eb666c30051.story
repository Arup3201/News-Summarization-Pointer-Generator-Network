A judge today backed a businessman who stabbed a burglar to death in self defence as he jailed the raider's accomplice for ten years.

Judge Mushtaq Khokhar said it had been 'natural' for Vincent Cooke 'to put up a fight' after he stabbed career criminal Raymond Jacob, 37, up to eight times following the raid in September last year.   

During the terrifying burglary at Mr Cooke's £350,000 four-bedroom house in Bramhall, near Stockport, Greater Manchester, Jacob held a knife to the businessman's throat before frogmarching him upstairs in search of jewellery and cash.

But when the victim’s wife Karen, 34, and 12-year old son Anthony returned home from a football tournament, Mr Cooke grabbed a carving knife and repeatedly stabbed Jacob during a violent struggle.

Mr Cooke, 39, who said he acted in lawful self defence, was questioned for 12 hours and later released without charge but was kept on bail for almost a month until he was told he would not be charged.

He and his family have since left their luxury home after suffering nightmares about the tragedy.

Yesterday full details of the raid emerged as Jacob’s accomplice Michael Thorpe, 33, of Heald Green, Manchester, was jailed for ten years after admitting aggravated burglary.

Passing sentence, Judge Mushtaq Khokhar told Thorpe: 'For anyone who lends themselves to an enterprise of this nature, it would be perfectly obvious that you would scare the victim with a knife by brandishing it and it was foreseeable that it might be used.

'It is natural to put up a fight, that 
is what happened in the kitchen, the complainant came upon a knife, not 
surprisingly in the kitchen, and sought to defend himself and his 
property and it was after that struggle between the two men that your 
accomplice was stabbed.'Judge Mushtaq Khokhar

'It is natural to put up a fight, that is what happened in the kitchen, the complainant came upon a knife, not surprisingly in the kitchen, and sought to defend himself and his property and it was after that struggle between the two men that your accomplice was stabbed.'

He added: 'It
was a sad loss of life but at the same time if you embark upon unlawful
enterprise with all the risks that are attached, serious injuries can 
occur.'

It also emerged the raiders had been given 
information about Mr Cooke’s safe from the victim’s uncle who helped him
run a transport storage firm.

Mr
Cooke had been at home watching TV when he answered a knock at the door
from a man in a high visibility jacket claiming to be from the gas 
board only for Jacob and Thorpe to burst in.

Mark Kellet, prosecuting said: 'One was holding a clipboard and paperwork which was part of the deception to gain entry.

'One shouted "you are being robbed" and were brandishing knives. One of the men shouts "upstairs, upstairs" and holds a knife to the face of Mr Cooke and frogmarched him upstairs to the study where the safe is.

'The relative and former business partner of Cooke was said to be the source of information that led to the house being targeted.'

Mr Kellet explained how the men then went downstairs to the kitchen when Mr Cooke's wife and son returned.

'The panic and confusion that followed caused Mr Cooke to grab the first thing that came to his hands and that was a knife from the knife block,' Mr Kellet said.

'Raymond Jacob lunged at him and the two collided and fell to the ground and it became a knife fight. Mr Cooke said "I felt like I was now fighting for my life, if I did not stab him first he would stab and kill me".'

Mr Cooke managed to break free but then heard screaming and saw Jacob fighting for his life and dialled 999.

Paramedics were unable to revive Jacob and he was declared dead at the scene. Thorpe was arrested later after a neighbour spotted him fleeing the scene in a Citroen Berlingo and made a note of the registration plate.

He later claimed he and Jacob had been invited into the house by Mr Cooke to discuss a business deal importing trainers, but a violent row broke out and Jacob was killed.

Mr Kellet said: 'In a victim impact statement from Karen it said stress and anxiety had been caused to the whole family caused by having men in the house.

'It had an effect in terms of mental health and a financial impact and impacted Anthony in particular and they had to move out of the area at a time when Anthony was involved in GCSE’s. Moving away from family and friends has a significant impact on him and what happened to his house.'

Jacob had dozens of convictions for burglary, robbery and theft. He once served an 18-month prison sentence for beating a man unconscious and leaving him looking 'like a piece of meat'.

In a statement issued at the time he was vindicated Mr Cooke said: 'I hope to now be able to get on with my life but will never forget the day that I had to fight for my life.

'I just want to get my life back on track. I’m still very traumatised by what happened. I’m still having nightmares every night about this incident.'

After the case, Senior Investigating Officer, Andy Tattersall, of Greater Manchester Police said: 'The fact that Thorpe was not armed that night and did not take part in the planning of the burglary is of little significance when you examine the tragic and unnecessary events that unfolded.

'One man lost his life, another, an innocent homeowner, lives with the knowledge that he took it, and a third will now spend several years behind bars. This incident has ended one life and destroyed two others.'

Mr Cooke was the third man in Greater Manchester in as many months to be vindicated after stabbing an intruder to death in self defence.

Peter Flanagan, 59, who stabbed an intruder armed with a machete to death at his Salford home, was told the following month that he would not be charged with any offence.

Then Cecil Coley, 72, was told he would not face any charges after he stabbed an armed robber to death during a raid at his florists shop in Old Trafford, Manchester.
