In an incredible act of generosity, a mother offered to act as a surrogate for her ex-husband’s new wife.

Julie Brackenbury, 34, offered to carry Rebecca Hankins’ baby after the 33-year-old was left infertile by cervical cancer treatment.

Julie, who had previously been married to Rebecca's husband, Scott, even went through gruelling IVF treatment to have the couple’s embryos implanted into her womb.

Rebecca told MailOnline: ‘Julie is a very motherly sort of person and we had grown quite close.

‘She understood my need to be a mum. But, despite this, I was mind-blown when she offered to be our surrogate.’

Rebecca, from Stamford in Lincolnshire, and her husband, Scott, had been trying for a baby for a year when she started to suffer bleeding after sex. 

The veterinary nurse, who was desperate for a child, visited her doctor who told her that she had a polyp which was probably responsible for the bleeding.

She had the polyp removed but, devastatingly, tests revealed it was cancerous.

At the age of just 27, Rebecca was diagnosed with cervical cancer.

At the age of 27 Rebecca was told she had cervical cancer and that the treatment would leave her unable to carry children. Before starting treatment she had some of her eggs harvested and had some embryos frozen

When Julie (pictured with her son Louis) heard about Rebecca's situation, she offered to act as a surrogate. She went through two rounds of IVF to have the frozen embryos implanted into her womb

She said: ‘I was devastated, but it was more the fact it would leave me childless, than the cancer itself, that worried me.’

Rebeccca had to have chemotherapy and radiotherapy as well as surgery to remove some of her lymph nodes.

As a result of the radiotherapy she was told she would not be able to carry a child and would go into early menopause.

She was desperate to have a baby so she delayed her treatment to allow her to harvest some of her eggs and freeze some embryos.

Tragically, both cycles of the treatment failed and Julie (pictured with her new partner, Luke) did not become pregnant with Rebecca's baby

She says 
that no one wanted her to do this as everyone, including her doctors, 
felt it would be better for her to start treatment immediately.

Despite this, she delayed her treatment for a month to enable her to have the procedure carried out.

She said: ‘For me there was so point having cancer treatment if I couldn’t have a baby so there was no question about it.’

Once Rebecca had recovered from her cancer treatment, she started to look into her fertility options.

Incredibly, at this point Julie, who has five of her own children, offered to be a surrogate.

She said: ‘Watching them go through cancer was hard and I got close to Rebecca.

‘The thought of them not being able to have a baby was awful and it was the thought of what I could give them at the end that made me want to do it.’

Julie, who lives in Peterborough, added that she wasn’t worried about the thought of having to hand the baby over once it was born as it wouldn’t be hers genetically and she had worked it out in her mind.

Eventually, in 2010, Julie went through two round of IVF during each of which she had two of Rebecca’s embryos implanted into her womb.

Tragically, neither of the IVF cycles worked and Julie didn't become pregnant.

Rebecca said: ‘It was devastating when the pregnancy test was negative.

‘I collapsed in a heap the second time as I knew I had no more frozen eggs to try.

‘I was grateful for everything she had done.’

Julie added: ‘It was dreadful, it was awful – it really was heart-breaking.

‘She took it hard but she was strong with it.

‘I felt really responsible and I felt I was letting her down.’

She added: ‘It didn’t really matter that the father would have been my ex-husband – it did raise a few eyebrows though.’

Rebecca and Julie are still friends and Rebecca has now been given the five year all clear from her cervical cancer.

However, sadly, her marriage to Scott broke down as she wanted to look into adoption and he didn’t.

She now has a new partner, Mark, and the pair are considering adoption.

Rebecca said: ‘A baby would be the ideal situation as I would like the experience of having a baby but we would consider a child of any age.

‘I would love to have two eventually.’

Rebecca is holding a Night In fundraising event to raise money for Macmillan Cancer Support as the charity supported her when she was ill.

The charity’s Night In idea sees people have friends round for an evening and they each donate what they would have spent on a night out.

Rebecca said: ‘I want to give something back to the charity that helped me.

‘A lot of women don’t talk about female cancer and Macmillan gave me useful advice and emotional support.’

Rebecca will be hosting a Night In for Macmillan on Friday 16th May. The event is simply about having friends round for a catch up, a laugh and something to eat and drink.

A Macmillan spokesperson said: 'The beauty of it is that you don’t have to train, get sweaty or even have to hassle people to sponsor you.

'Everyone just gives what they’d have spent on a night out and the money goes to help people keep on living life during and after cancer.'
