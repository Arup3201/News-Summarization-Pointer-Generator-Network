Take a bow England. That was an outstanding win and a perfect way to start a huge year. To make light of their injuries, to come to Wales on a Friday night and stay so cool and composed when they went 10-0 down was exceptional.

It was one of the very best performances of the Stuart Lancaster era.

I really enjoyed the contribution of the young Bath trio behind the scrum with Anthony Watson, Jonathan Joseph and George Ford all stepping up. This was a big night for them and they all delivered.

It was a huge second-half performance generally by England as they took the game by the scruff of the neck and bossed it in exactly the way you would hope from a team with genuine World Cup hopes.

The physicality was excellent but very controlled and disciplined and James Haskell overcame a nervous start – his missed tackle contributed to Wales’ first try – to produce probably his best England display. He was aggressive and relentless and took the battle to Wales in the way he does every week for Wasps.

All the England pack went well – I expected nothing less despite injuries in the second row – and although I was worried for a few minutes when Lancaster started emptying the bench when England were picking up momentum, everybody came through. Billy Twlevetrees was tackling like a man possessed at the end there.

Behind the scrum again just about everybody put their hand up with the Bath trio looking hungry and happy to take centre stage. There was an excitement and vitality to the England performance, not to mention a couple of very classy moments which really excited me going forward because this was a high-pressure match.

I can’t remember a bigger start to the Six Nations tournament and it was a real taster for the World Cup where every match will feel this big and important. The atmosphere was fantastic, inspiring, but we always knew it would be – roof open or not.

How the Six Nations table looks after Friday's result

Friday night was all about doing the right thing at the right time and doing it exceptionally well. And for the most part, it was a red-letter day for England

Test rugby is about world-class play under intense pressure, getting it right when it counts most. We saw that with the first-half tries – Rhys Webb for Wales and Watson for England. It was my old favourite TCUP – Thinking Clearly Under Pressure.

For the Wales try, England had seemingly rescued the situation with a powerful scrum on the Welsh put-in that sent the Wales pack travelling back at a rate of knots but Toby Faletau had the presence of mind to reach in and rescue the ball. In fact you could even argue that was handling in the scrum, he almost plucked it in the front row as the scrum disintegrated.

But Faletau showed great athleticism and skill. He attacked from a standing start, exploded out of the blocks, handed off the defence and released Webb perfectly. Haskell, making his one mistake of the night, hesitated just for a second, went too high and got shrugged off. That’s all it takes at this level.

And then again with England’s first try. England’s scrum had won a penalty and set up the field positon when Chris Robshaw’s pass went awry which often unsettles a defence. Mike Brown reacted superbly and put the ball on to his natural left foot to thread the grubber through. It was just about the only good option available and he took it. Watson read the play very well and showed real try-scoring instincts in getting the touchdown under pressure. That was world class at a time when England had to score next.

Watson was right at home – taking high ball, coming off his wing, working well with Brown. He was unlucky in the first half when he timed his ‘take’ perfectly so as not to take the ball into his 22 yet when Brown cleared 60 yards downfield he was brought back. Wrong call.

That decision-making ability under pressure is key in defence and it was making the wrong decisions that cost England those two early penalties which is something they can and must work on.

Wide out in the tramlines near the halfway line there was no reason for Jonny May to prevent release while Dan Cole was caught handling in a ruck needlessly 45 metres out. You just don’t do that when the opposition have a Leigh Halfpenny in their team. There was no danger in either situation for penalty but the mistakes resulted in England coughing up six points.

Come the second half, we saw ice in the veins when Joseph took his try so well. There was just a half-chance there and although the Wales defence wasn’t the best the Bath centre did very well with his step and swivel. And at the death Ford absolutely buried that long penalty – it could have been Jonny Wilkinson slotting the ball over.

Taking about pressure, that was definitely what caused the stand-off in the tunnel before the game. These unscripted things happen in sport. They are not choreographed; they just come from the dynamic tensions of the moment.

It happened with us in Ireland in 2005 when Martin Johnson stood his ground and declined to move across to the other side of the halfway line for the anthems. It’s all part of the game, it’s all good fun but Chris Robshaw wasn’t going to move until he got an assurance that Wales would be following soon behind and I quite like that.
