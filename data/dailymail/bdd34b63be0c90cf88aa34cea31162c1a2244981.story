It's quite simple... if you want goals, watch Newcastle vs Liverpool on Saturday afternoon. The clash produced one of the best ever top flight games in 1996, and has provided us with the most goals of any Premier League game.

A total of 129 goals in 40 games, that's 3.2 goals a game, helped by some high-scoring thrillers either side of the turn of the century.

In second is Liverpool vs Tottenham, with 2.8 goals a game, Arsenal vs Tottenham, Everton vs Manchester United and Newcastle United vs Tottenham also up there.

But the two sides aren't exactly firing on all cylinders. Liverpool have the joint-worst goals for record in the the top half of the table.

Meanwhile, Newcastle have scored just 10 goals this term, but are enjoying a mini revival with seven points from a possible nine, but more importantly for the neutrals, have conceded 15 goals already this season. 

What will Saturday provide? Here's a look at five of the best clashes.

Newcastle 0-6 Liverpool (2012-13)

An end-of-season trouncing at St James' Park gave us a taste of what Liverpool and Daniel Sturridge would provide for us the next season. This was Luis Suarez's first suspended game after biting Branislav Ivanovic.

Sturridge scored twice for the Reds, with Henderson also grabbing a brace.

Newcastle 3-1 Liverpool (2010-11)

Alan Pardew's first game as Liverpool boss after Chris Hughton left St James' Park, and two goals in the final 10 minutes from Joey Barton and Andy Carroll sealed it against Roy Hodgson's side. He left a month later.

Kenny Dalglish must have been impressed by Carroll, signing him for £35million shortly after.

Newcastle 1-4 Liverpool (1998-99) 

A match made memorable for Michael Owen's hands. The England star, fresh from a sintilizing World Cup in France, scored a hat-trick for the Reds, his third a superb show of his electric pace by taking on two defenders. 

He rubbed his hands together with a cheeky grin, a celebration shown over and over since.

Liverpool 4-3 Newcastle (1996-97)

The classic after the classic. 

Liverpool raced into a three-goal first-half lead through Steve McManaman, Patrik Berger and Robbie Fowler, but Newcastle found their way back.

Three goals in 17 minutes, the third coming in the 88th minute, brought them level, but Fowler went up the other end for the winner. Heartbreak. Especially after...

... Liverpool 4-3 Newcastle (1995-96) 

Routinely voted the best Premier League game of all time. 

Newcastle were three points off Manchester United at the top with two games in hand and eight games remaining.

And so it went: 1-0 Liverpool, 1-1, 2-1 Newcastle, 2-2, 3-2 Newcastle, 3-3 and then 4-3 Liverpool in the 92nd minute.

Stan Collymore's thunderous strike made boss Kevin Keegan bow his head in gut-wrenching fashion. United eventually won the league, predictably.
