'Attack': Mark Newman, 49, allegedly punched colleague Karen Woosman up to six times when she ended their relationship

A male nurse punched his lover up to six times when she ended their workplace romance, a disciplinary hearing was told.

Mark Newman, 49, also hid his history of violent attacks from his employers at the University Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff, before the attack.

The father-of-three allegedly hit Karen Woosman, 43, in the back of the head 'four, five or six times' when she asked him to leave after an argument about a text message on her phone.

The divorcee mother-of-one had embarked on a 'casual and fun fling' with Newman, her colleague in the surgical short stay unit, the Nursing and Midwifery Council was told.

But during their relationship she felt 'intimidated' by Newman who would leave flowers and chocolates on her car, the panel was told.

She accused him of 'acting like a 13-year-old boy rather than a 40-something father' and proudly telling colleagues they were seeing each other.

The mother told the hearing that she decided to end the fling when the text message was brought up.

She said: 'Mark was going berserk - he was calling me all the names under the sun.

'I told him to leave the house but he said he wouldn’t. I pushed him firmly in the chest to tell him to get out. He started to punch me at full force with a closed first in the back of the head.

'From the way he was attacking me I felt sure he would not have stopped until I was lying on the floor.

'It all happened in a blur, I didn’t expect him to ever hit me, I fell to the ground, I was in shock, I was frightened. The next morning I was stiff and I had shooting pains in my neck.'

Newman had three previous convictions for
violent behaviour between 1984 and 2010 which he did not reveal to 
management when he was given his job.

Miss Woosman said she was initially attracted to the father, from Cardiff, because he was 'funny and charming'.

She added: 'We were seeing each other outside work against my better judgment because I had just got divorced and wasn’t in the best state of mind.

'But I found him funny and charming. I naively thought we could maintain a professional relationship.

'I told him not to tell anyone but he started talking about me to people at work.

'Mark then became very possessive, he told me he would make my life difficult if I stopped seeing him.'

Miss Woosnam claims she tried to sever contact with Newman who was suspended after the incident.

From behind a screen at the hearing she told Newman: 'I never loved you. You would say you loved me all the time and I had to say it back.

'You knew from day one it was casual and just a bit of fun, but you became very serious after a while and I didn’t want to do it any more.

'You used to put things on my car like lots of flowers and chocolates, I felt intimidated by you. You were telling people around work about us. I don’t know what you were hoping to achieve by that.'

Newman denies hitting Miss Woosnam and claims she fabricated the attack.

He told her: 'I can assure you that if I had punched you, or another person, four times with a closed fist you would had to have gone to an A&E department.'

Employers: Newman failed to declare his previous convictions to bosses at the University Hospital of Wales, the tribunal heard

Newman admits failing to disclose three convictions when he applied for his job as a nurse at the 1,000-bed teaching hospital in the Welsh capital.

He was convicted of criminal damage in 2010 and received 100 hours unpaid community work. He was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and criminal damage in 1985.

And in 1984 he was convicted of using threatening, abusive, insulting words or behaviour contrary to the Public Order Act.

Newman, a nurse since 1994, denies dishonesty and claims his fitness to practice is not impaired.

Presenting officer James Edenborough told the hearing: 'The registrant had these convictions but did not disclose them. The charges deal with different matters but they are related in type.'

Newman denies an allegation of accessing a different woman’s medical records for no clinical reason.

He is also accused of calling a consultant 'incompetent' and 'useless' in front of a patient which he also denies. The hearing in Cardiff continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
