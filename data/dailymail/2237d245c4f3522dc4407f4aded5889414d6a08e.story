A 16th century mansion set in a 51 acre estate which was re-modelled by one of Britain's greatest ever architects has gone on the market with a guide price of £8million.

The eight bedroom home, now known as Warren Mere in Surrey, boasts three lakes, a paddock, a stable block, a pool, a tennis court and a guest cottage with four bedrooms.

It was remodelled in 1897 by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the architect best-known for designing the Cenotaph in Whitehall as well as the city of New Dehli in India and several landmarks in the city of London.

Warren Mere, the eight bedroom home in Surrey, which was built in the 16th century but remodelled by Sir Edwin Lutyens, one of Britain's greatest ever architects 

The property on sale with a guide price of £8million is set in 51 acres and as well as the main house also has a guest home with four bedrooms, which it is suggested could be used as staff quarters 

The grounds of the property were designed by celebrated horticulturalist Gertrude Jekyll with the estate having three separate lakes 

Sir Edwin was asked to remodel the house, which dates back to the 1700s, into an arts and crafts style mansion before he made his name as an architect.

Soon after he was commissioned to design several houses and churches before gaining the job of creating the city of New Dehli, India's imperial capital.

Before the end of the First World War he was one of three architects appointed by the war graves commission to create memorials to the war dead.

He then created the Cenotaph in central London, which took him just six hours to design.

To remodel Warren Mere, he teamed up with celebrated horticulturalist Gertrude Jekyll who remodelled the property's grounds.

The main house is approached by a long driveway with wrought iron gates which opens up into grounds with brick paths.

Inside there are four reception rooms, including a family room, an orangery, a dining room and a formal sitting room.

It also boasts eight bedrooms as well as a sauna, extensive outbuildings as well as a guest cottage with four bedrooms, which it has been suggested could be used for staff quarters.

Exposed beams run along the roof of the main house, which has been put up for sale and is being marketed by agents Hampton International

Sir Edwin Lutyens, who is often referred to as Britain's greatest ever architect, who remodelled Warren Mere in 1897. He is best known for designing the Cenotaph in central London 

Sir Edwin Landseer Lutyens has been referred to as 'the greatest British architect'.

He designed the Grade I listed Cenotaph that stands in Whitehall, London.

It was erected in 1919 for the Allied Victory Parade and was intended to commemorate the victims of the First World War.

But it is now used to remember all of the dead in all wars in which British servicemen and women have fought.

He is known for having an instrumental role in designing and building a section of the metropolis of Delhi, known as New Delhi.

In collaboration with Sir Herbert Baker, he was also the main architect of several monuments including the India Gate in Delhi.

He also designed Viceroy's House, which is now known as the Rashtrapati Bhavan.

It is regarded as his most important building and combined aspects of classical architecture with Indian decoration.

In 1924 he completed the supervision of the construction of what is perhaps his most popular design: Queen Mary's Dolls' House.

This four-storey Palladian villa was built in 1/12 scale and is now a permanent exhibit in the public area of Windsor Castle.

He married Emily Lytton, daughter of a Viceroy of India, in 1897.

After World War I Lutyens became architect to the Imperial War Graves Commission, for which he designed the Cenotaph, the Great War Stone and military cemeteries in France.

His vast project for the Roman Catholic cathedral at Liverpool was incomplete at his death.

He also designed the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme, which remembers 72,195 British and South African men who died in the Battles of the Somme.

It is the largest British battle memorial in the world and was built between 1928 and 1932.
