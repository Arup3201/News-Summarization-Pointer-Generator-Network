Top players often try to find a way to avoid difficult questions from the press, but Daniel Alves has found a more inventive method than most.

The Barcelona full back was hounded by journalists while travelling home from a few days off over the international break.

Alves has been linked with a move away from the Nou Camp when his contract expires this summer, and he was repeatedly asked where he would be going. 

After being pressed about his future at Barcelona, Daniel Alves started singing at journalists

Despite Alves wearing headphones and giving every indication that he had no interest in talking to the press, the questions kept coming.

Eventually, when directly asked about a reported agreement with Paris St Germain, the Brazil defender lost patience, grabbing the microphone off one of the reporters and bursting into song, blasting out a few bars of Bazilian singer-songwriter Xande de Pilares  

Fortunately Alves is a better footballer than a singer, and despite not featuring during this international break, and being allowed to leave Barcelona, is not without suitors amongst Europe's elite.
