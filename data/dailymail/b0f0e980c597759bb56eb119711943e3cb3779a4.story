Cruel: Natalie Armitage (pictured), 20, admitted four animal welfare charges when she appeared before magistrates

A pet owner has been banned from keeping animals after she starved her cat so badly he broke into a hamster's cage and ate the animal inside.

Jeffrey the cat was only allowed to drink water from the toilet and eat stale dog biscuits so in desperation he mauled the rodent, a court heard.

Natalie Armitage, 20, has admitted four animal welfare charges and has been banned from keeping animals for five years.

Calderdale Magistrates Court heard that RSPCA inspectors repeatedly called at her address in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, in October last year because of welfare concerns.

The police were called to gain access to the house, which was in darkness.

'In the living room the hamster cage was broken into pieces and there was no sign of the hamster,' said Tanya Forrest, prosecuting.

Eventually, Armitage answered the door to an inspector and was asked 'where is the hamster?' to which she replied: 'I think the cat has eaten it.'

Ms Forrest said: 'I think that is evidenced by the cage - the cat broke into it.

'Regrettably, the consequence was the hamster met its fate.'

Armitage, who was not represented, said she went to Crewe for dental treatment but her son was taken ill and she was away longer than expected.

She had fallen out with her mum and sister and had no-one to access the property.

Armitage said she thought she was away for around six nights.

Hungry: Jeffrey the cat (pictured) was so starved of suitable food and water that he destroyed the cage of the terrified animal and gobbled him up, a court heard

Scene: The RSPCA found that the hamster's cage had been broken open so the cat could find a meal

Chairman of the bench, Andrew Entwistle, told her: 'You left the cat for longer than you like to admit. The cat did suffer. The hamster is no more.'

The charges she admitted covered not providing a suitable environment for Jeffrey, not ensuring his need for a suitable diet including water, failing to protect Jeffrey from pain, suffering, injury and disease, and not protecting the hamster from pain, suffering, injury and disease.

Armitage, who is on benefits, was fined £50 with £200 costs and a £15 pounds victim surcharge, and was disqualified from keeping animals for five years.

A deprivation order was made to take Jeffrey, currently in boarding, off her.

Carnage: Jeffrey was only able to crink toilet water and eat dry dog biscuits, but he is now re-homed

After the case, an RSPCA spokesperson said: 'This is a very sad situation for  both the cat and the hamster. Both were left to fend for themselves for nearly  a whole week.

'It is not the cat's fault that he found himself drawn, through hunger, to seek out his only option for sustenance. But on the other hand, one can only imagine the hamster's terror as his cage was broken apart.

'It is an offence to leave your pets without arranging for their basic welfare needs to be taken care of.'
