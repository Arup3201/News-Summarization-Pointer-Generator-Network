Police forces are to have their crime statistics examined every year after senior officers admitted the figures are routinely fiddled. 

HM Inspectorate of Constabulary is being given an extra £9.4 million to fund force inspections on core policing, which includes crime recording.

It is also to publish a one-off report which will expose more of the tricks used by police to keep crime rates down.

The Chief Inspector of Constabulary, Tom Winsor, admitted: ‘I have no doubt we will find a degree of fiddling of the figures.' 

The Home Office is also changing how police report clear-up rates, to stop them 'chasing targets to gain easy detections' or avoiding recording crimes they could never solve.

A more detailed range of crime outcomes will be published with some categories – such as recording an offence as ‘undetected’ – being scrapped, Policing Minister Damian Green said.

As the Mail on Sunday revealed, police told a parliamentary inquiry that victims are often disbelieved in a bid to keep crimes off the books, while serious incidents are downgraded and offenders encouraged to admit extra offences.

Police chiefs told MPs how serious 
offences including rape, child abuse and robberies were 'disappearing in
 a puff of smoke' as officers manipulated figures.

Forces were accused of downgrading the nature of crimes to make them seem less serious or erasing them from data altogether.

One analyst claimed hundreds of burglaries 'disappeared' in a matter of weeks at the Met after managers intervened.

The claims were made at a hearing of Parliament’s Public Administration Committee in November.

Mr Winsor added: 'The accuracy and integrity of police recorded crime data is extremely important.

'HMIC is already carrying out a 43-force inspection of police crime recording policies and practices, and an interim report is scheduled for April 2014. 

'In addition, in 2014/15 HMIC will begin a new annual programme of all-force inspections of core policing work, and that will include crime recording.'
