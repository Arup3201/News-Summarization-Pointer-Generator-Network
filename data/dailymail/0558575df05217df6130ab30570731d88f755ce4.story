Chelsea striker Didier Drogba is known for his leadership qualities within the Stamford Bridge squad.

The 36-year-old posed on his Instagram account with what he hailed the ‘Drog gang!’ as the Chelsea players wrapped up in hats and snoods during a freezing training session in Surrey.

Brazilians Ramires and Willian joined Drogba in the picture as members of the squad carried out duties for Chelsea TV ahead of hosting Everton at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday evening.

The former Ivory Coast talisman has been busy on Instagram over the weekend, watching eagerly on Sunday night as his national side prevailed against Ghana to win the Africa Cup of Nations.

Watching with a group of friends and family, Drogba posted a video on his Instagram account celebrating the tense 9-8 victory on penalties.

The veteran striker, who retired from international duty in August 2014, erupted in celebration after Ivory Coast keeper Boubacar Barry’s winning spot-kick, seen jumping on his sofa after the final whistle.
