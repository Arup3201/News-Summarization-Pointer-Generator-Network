Killer: Imran Hussain, 27, has been found guilty of stabbing an 18-year-old gap year student to death in Manchester

A smiling assassin who stabbed a ‘caring and quiet’ teenager to death in an unprovoked attack has been found guilty of murder.

Gap-year student Kieran Crump-Raiswell, 18, was handing out his CV in the hope of finding a job when he was knifed to death in broad daylight.

Imran Hussain, 27, walked up to the teenager and ‘without warning’ stabbed him four times in the chest because he ‘simply wanted to see what it’s like to kill someone’, a court was told.

Witnesses said engineering student Hussain appeared to be ‘laughing’ and ‘sniggering’ as he walked away.

Hussain had denied murder but admitted manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility following evidence that it was ‘highly likely’ he suffers from paranoid schizophrenia.

But a jury at Manchester Crown Court rejected his defence and found him guilty of murder yesterday after they heard that he wanted the power to choose ‘who lived and who died’.

Kieran’s family described the murder as ‘senseless’ and said they felt his loss ‘all the time’.

Kieran lived with his father Roland Crump, 54, mother Christine Raiswell, 45, sister Anna, 17, and brother Paddy, 14, in Chorlton, Greater Manchester.

Mrs Raiswell, a public health programme manager, said: ‘It is so completely senseless.

Random: Gap year student Kieran Crump-Raiswell was walking to a bus stop in Chorlton when he was attacked

‘He was just walking along enjoying 
himself and somebody has attacked him. He did not have a chance to do 
anything. There was no motive.

'It was just a random, violent assault. It
has been very difficult as a family. It is very, very hard because we 
feel his loss all the time, and that will continue.’

The killing was the second of two 
street assaults committed by Hussain on strangers within 12 days in 
January.

On January 4, mature student Hussain drove from his flat in 
Coventry to Nottingham where he punched probation worker Paul Kershaw in
the face before running off.

On January 16, Hussain travelled to Manchester before attacking keen sportsman Kieran on the streets of Whalley Range.

Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, said: 
‘Fortified by the apparent ease at which a stranger could be attacked, 
this time he travelled to Manchester armed with a knife and intending to
kill someone.’

Victim: This CCTV footage showed Kieran Crump Raiswell taken moments before he was stabbed to death in January

Heartbreaking: The 'caring and quiet' teenager was out looking for a job when he was stabbed to death in the street

Hussain drove around Whalley Range and
Chorlton in the city for an hour in the early afternoon before spotting
Kieran walking along the road listening to music on his headphones.

He began to circle him, passing him 
five times in his black Ford KA before parking up and waiting for him.

Kieran was carrying his rucksack containing copies of his CV that he 
intended to hand to shops and businesses.

The jury was shown shocking CCTV 
footage of the attack, with Kieran, who was planning to read history at 
Sheffield Hallam University, being stabbed before collapsing to the 
ground.

Random: The attack was Hussain's second street assault on total strangers in 12 days

Callous: Hussain was heard to be 'sniggering' and 'laughing' as he ran from the scene

Mr Wright added: ‘The cold stark truth
is that . . . (Hussain) decided to see if he could get away with 
killing someone. He could exercise power of life and death; he could 
choose who lived and who died.’

Witness Roy Rankin said: ‘He took his headphones off and fell forward to the ground. He had blood around the mouth and nostrils.

‘I started crying – the lad looked so innocent, not streetwise like the man that had run off.

‘The other man had a big snigger, a smirk, a laugh.’

Hussain walked calmly to his car 
before driving back to his rented flat where he ‘hid the knife and 
carried on with his studies’.

Hussain will be sentenced today.

Heartbreak: Kieran was about to get the bus in to Manchester city centre to look for a job - he was carrying his CV and passport in a backpack

Investigation: The police complaints watchdog is looking into Nottingham Police's response to Hussain's earlier assault - 12 days before he killed Kieran, pictured with his mother Christine

Charlotte Rimmer, District Crown Prosecutor at CPS North West, said: 'As a result of the verdict reached today, Imran Hussain has been found guilty of the senseless and brutal murder of Kieran Crump Raiswell. It was an unprovoked attack on a young man who had his whole life ahead of him.

'Throughout the investigation and the court case, Imran Hussain has refused to accept full responsibility for his actions, instead choosing to hide behind the defence of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility.

'Nevertheless, the CPS has been determined to bring him to justice and we have worked hard to piece together the evidence and build a strong case against him for the more serious charge of murder.

'Consequently, the jury have rejected his version of events and accepted the prosecution’s case that Imran Hussain was in fact fully in control of his actions when he travelled to Manchester and stabbed Kieran to death in full view of passing members of the public.

'At the heart of this truly saddening case in the tragic loss of an innocent man’s life and I would like to offer my sincere condolences to Kieran’s family and friends.

'Although today’s outcome will not bring Kieran back, I hope that it goes some way towards helping them come to terms with their loss.'

The family of Kieran Crump-Raiswell have said his murder was 'completely senseless'.

The 18-year-old was stabbed to death in the street in Whalley Range, Manchester, by total stranger Imran Hussain, 27, in January.

The youngster was on a gap year ahead of his acceptance to study history at Sheffield Hallam University later this year.

The Manchester City fan had just returned from the United States where he was on a three-month football coaching course in Virginia.

He lived in Chorlton with father Roland Crump, 54, mother Christine Raiswell, 45, his sister Anna, 17, and brother Paddy, 14.

He was heading into Manchester city centre to find a job when he was attacked without warning in broad daylight in front of stunned witnesses.

His father said: 'Kieran had been into Manchester the previous day with his CVs in his bag and had been handing them out.

'He headed out into town again. He left the house and I was the last one to see him. He just said that he was going into town.

'Kieran was quiet. He never had a bad word for anyone. No one ever had a bad word for him. Five hundred people turned up to the funeral. The response from the wider community was just fantastic and we want to say thank you.'

'Mature': Kieran's mother said he was 'caring' and was just 'turning into a man' when he knifed to death at the age of 18

Mr Crump, who works as an interpreter
and translator, added: 'He had his whole life in front of him and was 
planning for the future. He was quite a mature person for his age.

'He was very family-orientated. He spent a lot of time with his family and he enjoyed his family. He would really look after Paddy and Anna.

'It is such a big loss for our other two children that they have not got him here. He was a caring big brother.'

Mrs Raiswell, a public health programme manager for Manchester City Council, said: 'It is so completely senseless. People have said things like he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but he wasn’t.

'He was just walking along enjoying himself and somebody has attacked him. He did not have a chance to do anything. There was no motive. It was just a random, violent assault.

'It has been very difficult as a family. We have got two other fantastic children and we do not want the impact on their lives to be worse than it has been. It is very, very hard because we feel his loss all the time, and that will continue.

'I think of him everyday and I am going to miss him everyday. People ask all the time and say they cannot imagine how we feel.

'It feels a bit like you have lost a leg. You will never be the same again and it will always be very apparent, but you learn to adapt.'

She continued: 'He was never in any trouble. He did well at his exams and he was very reliable. He played for the same football team for 10 years and was incredibly loyal to his friends and his family.

'He was 18 and he was turning into a man. He had a real social conscience and did not like to see injustice. He would give his change to homeless people and he had done some voluntary work for FareShare, a food supply organisation for the vulnerable, homeless and needy.

'It was just before Christmas and he was helping fill the hampers with food and goods for the needy.

'He felt very strongly about those sorts of issues. He was quiet, but he had those great strengths.'

Mr Crump also told how he has now moved seats at the Etihad Stadium as he watched Manchester City with sons Paddy and Kieran, who played for Sale Cricket Club and football for FC Bluestar in Didsbury.

Mr Crump said: 'At football it is just me and Paddy now who watch City. We did have three seats in the family stand. Thanks to City we have been moved to another part of the ground because it is not the same.

'This is something that is not going to go away.'
