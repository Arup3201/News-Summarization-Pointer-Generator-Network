Dozens of police officers paid a solemn tribute to one of their K-9 officers who had to be put down after developing terminal cancer. 

Oviedo Police Department in Florida paid an emotional tribute to Nero, a six year old German Shepherd, who had to be put to sleep. 

More than a dozen police cars, showing their blue flashing lights followed Nero as he made his final journey with Officer David Capetillo to the vet.

The flashing light tribute is normally reserved for fallen officers. 

Fellow dog handlers waited for Officer Capetillo to arrive and held a guard of honour as Nero was led into the surgery. 

The Last Post was also played.  

According to a statement by the City of Oviedo: 'It is with heavy hearts we report that one of our K-9 officers will be laid to rest today at 3pm. Recently, Nero was diagnosed with terminal cancer and for humane reasons will be laid to rest today.

'Nero has been a part of the Oviedo Police Department for the past four years, and along with his handler, Officer David Capetillo, has been responsible for a number of drug detections, with tracking numerous criminal suspects, lost children and missing endangered adults.'

He also performed at demonstrations in local schools.
