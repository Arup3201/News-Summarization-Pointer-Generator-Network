Special measures: Tameside Hospital in Manchester was one of 11 NHS Trusts ordered to undergo the ‘improvement’ process in July 2013

Death rates at an NHS hospital have risen despite it being placed in special measures in an effort to bring them down.

Tameside Hospital in Manchester was one of 11 NHS Trusts ordered to undergo the ‘improvement’ process in July 2013 by NHS England medical director Sir Bruce Keogh.

But according to a shock report to be published today, mortality rates have actually increased, with about 35 more patients dying there in 2013 than was expected.

Rates at a second hospital – Medway Maritime in Kent – which was also placed in special measures, have remained stubbornly high.

Despite the news, the special measures programme has been deemed a success as death rates fell significantly at eight out of 11 hospitals – saving about 450 lives.

The figures are disclosed in a report today by healthcare analysts Dr Foster – and the results matter politically because the special measures programme was ordered personally by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt.

Last night, grieving relative Frank Lynch said he watched his 89-year-old mother Phyllis Hutchings turn into a ‘bag of bones’ before her death at Medway last August.

He believes his mother, who suffered from dementia, died of malnutrition because nurses failed to feed her.

A Tameside Hospital spokesman suggested that ‘data quality issues’ might explain in part why death rates had gone up.

A spokesman for Medway Maritime said a ‘targeted programme of work’ was being put into place.
