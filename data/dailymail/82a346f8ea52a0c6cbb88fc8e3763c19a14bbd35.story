Tahira Bano has been banned from owning a dog for 15 years after dumping her starving, dying puppy on a roadside in Rochdale

A mother who dumped her starved, dying puppy on the road in Rochdale was today banned from keeping dogs for 15 years.

Tahira Bano's Staffordshire Bull Terrier was so emaciated and dehydrated she had to be put down just hours after rescuers found her. As a result of hypothermia the dog's heart beat could hardly be measured. 

RSPCA investigators were alerted after Bano phoned police claiming she had found the female dog wrapped in a blanket.

An officer attended and found the puppy weighed just 18.7lb, almost half the 33lb normal weight for a breed of her size. The dog was believed to be between six and eight weeks old, the Manchester Evening News reported. 

After an appeal to the public for information, Bano was identified as the dog's owner. 

The 37-year-old lives on Cronkeyshaw Road in Rochdale, close to where the dog was found shortly before midnight on October 16, 2013. 

Bano insisted that the puppy was not hers and denied causing unnecessary suffering to it.

But the mother-of-one was today found guilty at the Bury magistrates court and was sentenced to 18 weeks jail, suspended for two years. Bano was also ordered to do 100 hours of unpaid work and pay £2,000 in costs. 

The RSPCA had previously visited Bano on three occasions in 2011 and 2012 after complaints from the public about the welfare of a dog at her address, Kyra Badman, prosecuting said.

Chairman of the bench Malcolm Bywater said Bano had neglected the puppy over a 'prolonged period', despite receiving advice form the RSPCA. 

Steven North, defending, said Bano, who works in a salon in Rochdale, continued to maintain her innocence and was considering an appeal.

 Bano continues to maintain the puppy was not hers, and claims she simply found the dog on the road

He said: 'It's difficult to mitigate in circumstances like this where someone still doesn't accept responsibility for their actions.

'However, she has no previous convictions and has never been before the courts before.'

Speaking after the case, RSPCA Inspector Jason Bowles said: 'The aggravating feature here is that she denied that this was her dog, which to me is despicable.

'We rely on information given to us by the public.'
