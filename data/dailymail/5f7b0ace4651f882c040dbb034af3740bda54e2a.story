England Under 19s hammered hosts Luxembourg 8-0 on Sunday to all but ensure their progression from the first qualifying round for the 2015 European Championship.

Braces from Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Patrick Roberts and Brandon Barker, as well as goals from Charlie Colkett and Bradley Fewster, saw England followed up their opening win over Belarus with another victory.

Sean O'Driscoll's side have now scored 11 goals in two games without reply and face Belgium on Wednesday in their final Group 1 game, knowing they have almost ensured progression to the tournament in Greece next year.

Ruben Loftus-Cheek, pictured playing against Ukraine in May, scored twice in England Under 19s' 8-0 win

ENGLAND UNDER 19s: Smith, Aina (C), Burke, Galloway (Dickie 46), Roberts, Colkett, Fewster, Smith-Brown, Loftus-Cheek (Morris 67), Winks, Barker (Kiwomya 46)

Goals: Loftus-Cheek (7, 50), Colkett (13), Barker (pen 21, 43), Roberts (pen 21, 90), Fewster (88)

The Three Lions started the match at the Stade rue Henri Dunant in Luxembourg City quickly and were ahead inside seven minutes.

Chelsea's Loftus-Cheek exchanged some neat passes with Fulham's Roberts before smashing home.

And just six minutes later England were two up. Manchester City winger Barker put in an exquisite cross for Chelsea's Colkett who prodded home.

It was then Barker's turn to provide for himself as he converted an unstoppable penalty after being tripped in the box after 21 minutes.

A second penalty soon arrived too as Roberts was felled and, after being forced to re-take the spot kick, he coolly slotted the ball the opposite way to the goalkeeper.

Barker then ensured it was 5-0 at half-time when he curled a magnificent free-kick from the edge of the area into the top corner.

The second half did not get much better for the hosts either, as Loftus-Cheek broke clear five minutes after the restart to slot in England's sixth.

But then Luxembourg did enjoy their best chance of the game - after 66 minutes Cedric Sacras shot and the ball took a wicked deflection off Colkett and on to the crossbar.

England added two further goals in the final moments through Middlesbrough forward Fewster and Roberts to put some added gloss on the scoreline in what was an emphatic victory.
