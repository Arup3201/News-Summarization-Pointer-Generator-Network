These shocking photos reveal why a father on his way home to join his wife and their seven-month-old son stood no hope when a 20-ton container fell off a lorry and flattened his car.

Maoj Masih, 32, had just phoned his wife Rachel, 22, to say he was on his way home to join her, their son and his father when the accident happened.

The vehicle, which had been waiting at lights in Sydney while the truck turned left beside him, was flattened to a height of about 18 inches where Mr Masih was sitting.

Firefighters and police were said to be in 'disbelief' when they arrived at the scene of the accident, pictured, which happened at traffic lights in Sydney

Police, firemen and ambulance officers were stunned when they arrived at the scene, staring in disbelief at the crushed vehicle.

Motorist Mark Young, who had watched in horror as the huge container crashed down on Mr Masih's small car, ran to the vehicle to see if he could help.

'I couldn't see much at all,' said Mr Young. 'His torso was covered in metal but his hand was sticking out. I called out "Mate, are you all right?" but there was no response.'

He said he had noticed a children's toy 
on the back seat of the mangled car and his heart sank as he realised 
there might have been a child in the car.

But Mr Masih's baby son was at home in western Sydney with his wife - and it was she who had become increasingly concerned when she tried to call his mobile and there was no answer.

Sarah Elnoz, was hanging out the washing on her balcony when she saw the lorry tip over, throwing the container onto the car that was waiting at the lights.

'Then all you could hear was the car it landed on - its horn was going continuously for ages,' she said.

'I just thought to myself "Oh my God, someone is in that car."'

A family friend, Mr Jai Kumar David, said Mr Masih had celebrated the christening of his son, Jason, just three months ago.

'He had invited family from India, cooked a wonderful meal and bought gifts for all the guests because he wanted this to be a wonderful ceremony,' said Mr David.

Mr Masih arrived in Australia from the Punjab six years ago to start a new life and was described as being a valued member of the Indian and Christian communities in the Fairfield area of western Sydney.

Mr Masih's father, who is visiting from India, and his wife were in shock today as police interviewed the 46-year-old lorry driver.
