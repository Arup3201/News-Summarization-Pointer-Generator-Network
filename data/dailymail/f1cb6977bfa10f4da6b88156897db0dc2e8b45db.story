The troubled son of Dynasty star Kate O’Mara hanged himself after she asked him to move out of her home, an inquest heard yesterday.

It is thought Dickon O’Mara had been dead for up to three weeks  when his body was discovered on  New Year’s Eve, just days before his 50th birthday.

He had spiralled into a life of drink and drug abuse after suffering brain damage when he was run over three years earlier, the court heard.

In a final text to his mother he wrote: ‘I wish the car that hit me was going faster.’

The inquest heard he appeared to have been sleeping in the garage of his mother’s home after she asked him to leave her cottage two months earlier because she could no longer cope with his behaviour.

By then, the 73-year-old actress had been hospitalised with pneumonia. She was still too ill to attend yesterday’s inquest.

The unemployed theatre technician had been hit by a car in January 2010 and suffered brain injuries which affected his balance and left him unable to work.

Miss O’Mara later bought a property in Long Marston, Warwickshire, in the hope her son could obtain work at the Royal Shakespeare Company in nearby Stratford-upon-Avon. But he struggled to find a job.

Detective Constable Philip Hewish told the court that Mr O’Mara ‘struggled to cope’ with his mother’s diagnosis of pneumonia in September ‘and his drinking became worse’.

Police were called to an argument between the pair at her cottage in October, which led to her renting a home for him in Stratford.

The following month, a friend of Mr O’Mara’s contacted police after he texted her with the message: ‘It’s time to die.’

He was found ‘safe and well’ in the town by police, the hearing at the Warwickshire Justice Centre in Leamington Spa was told.

His final contact with his mother came in a flurry of texts he sent in December. One said: ‘I hope you are OK? I can text or email. Write to me if you so wish. XX’.

Another simply said: ‘Get better, get well XX,’ while in a third he revealed he was staying in a hostel for a night.

The final message, on December 8, hinted at Mr O’Mara’s state of mind. He wrote: ‘I wish the ******* car that hit me was going faster.’

He was discovered hanged from a beam in his mother’s garage by a neighbour.

It appeared he had been living there secretly and he had made himself a makeshift bed from workbenches and a mattress.

Sean McGovern, coroner for Coventry and Warwickshire, said he suspected that Mr O’Mara died a short time  after he sent his final text to his mother.

Patricia Purkiss, Mr O’Mara’s godmother and a close friend of  his mother for more than 40 years,  said Miss O’Mara had been texting her son after that message ‘but there was no response’.

She said: ‘His mother loved him dearly and she fought like a tiger for him but in the end she was too ill to fight.’

Miss O’Mara’s sister, Belinda Cochrane, told the coroner her nephew was a ‘lovely person’ but had been a ‘very troubled soul for a very long time’ and had ‘wasted’ his talent.

Mrs Cochrane said she was certain he had committed suicide because he had ‘threatened it so much, for so long’.

The inquest heard Mr O’Mara had attempted suicide twice before – once by hanging in 1994 and again in 2003 when he attempted to gas himself.

There was no evidence of drink or drugs in his system when he died. The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide.
