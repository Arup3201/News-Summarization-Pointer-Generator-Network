When Carol Jumper was diagnosed with cancer last month, she broke the news to her employer - but instead of sympathy and support she received a letter announcing her immediate termination.

The handwritten note from Pennsylvania oral surgeon Dr George Visnich to his long-time employee, 51-year-old Ms Jumper, of Hopewell, sparked a firestorm this week after it was shared on social media.

The letter, written on Visnich's office stationary and dated August 11, opened with the line: 'You are currently engaged in a battle against cancer that will be demanding physically, mentally, and emotionally.’

Unceremoniously dismissed: Carol Jumper, 51, received this note from her employer, Dr George Visnich, telling her that she was being let go because of her cancer diagnosis

Dr Visnich then explained to Ms Jumper that her symptoms, medications and side effects of chemotherapy will distract her from functioning in his office 'at the level required.'

'Because of this, I am laying you off without pay as of August 11, 2014,' the dental specialist concluded. 

Office veteran: Jumper has worked for Visnich for more than 12 years, until last month when she learned that she was suffering from a cancer impacting her liver, ovaries and pancreas

He closed the termination letter with the words: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with you as you fight this horrible disease... I hope your battle is swift, smooth and successful!!'

Dennis Smerigan, Carol Jumper's fiance, told the Beaver Countian that she is suffering from a cancer that affects her pancreas, liver, and ovaries.

She was diagnosed with the potentially deadly illness last month after going to a doctor complaining of stomach pains.

Jumper has worked for Visnich for more than 12 years, but you wouldn't know it from the apparent lack of sympathy he has shown the woman in her hour of need, according to Smerigan .

'He didn't even call her, he hasn't called her once since she got sick,' the fiance told the paper.

But according to the lawyer hired by the oral surgeon, it was all a big misunderstanding caused by what was intended as an act of kindness on Visnich’s part.

Attorney Larry Kelly told the Beaver County Times Visnich laid off Jumper so she could collect unemployment benefits while undergoing cancer treatment, ‘with the understanding that when she is feeling better, she can come back to work.’

The lawyer said his client has found the public outcry over his letter 'very troubling' because he was being vilified for trying to perform a 'humanitarian' act.

Jumper's friend John Barkovich told the Times that she now wants to put the entire episode behind her and focus on the fight for her life.

Jumper's supporters have created a Facebook group called Bumper's Buddies to help raise money for her medical expenses by selling T-shirts and hosting charity events.

Big misunderstanding: A lawyer representing Visnich, who owns this practice in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, insisted that the doctor temporarily laid off Jumper so she could collect unemployment benefits
