What is it about the British and treasure hunts? Hint at something shiny, add an air of mystery — and we reach for our spades.

That’s what’s happening on Folkestone’s Outer Harbour beach this week, where wily German artist Michael Sailstorfer has tapped deep into the British national character by hiding 30 miniature 24-carat gold bars beneath the sand.

He has upped the romance of it all by burying the bullion, worth £10,000, between the high and low tidelines. Cue dozens of people rushing down to the shore whenever the sea goes out.

National obsession: Hundreds flocked to Folkestone's Outer Harbour beach in search of bullion this week

So far, just a handful of the bars are thought to have been discovered, with those successful including a trio from Canterbury — Kevin Wood, Kirsty Henderson and her sister Megan — and a local family. There’s still plenty of gold in them thar sands.

And the Folkestone hoard, part of an arts festival, isn’t the only treasure around.

In Cheltenham, a jeweller is staging a diamond hunt to raise money for cancer charity Maggie’s. Ten genuine, if small, diamonds — worth £10,000 in total — have been hidden in obscure spots around the town. Participants buy maps and clues to track them down, and the winners can have the stones made into their own unique piece of jewellery.

In June this year, U.S. property millionaire Jason Buzi was even more ambitious in the scale of his hunt, hiding cash in cities around the world and posting clues online. What he called ‘a fun game that brings people together’ caused such a fever that a park in California was ripped apart — the fences torn down by fortune seekers.

The reaction was also intense in London, where crowds descended on Kensington Gardens in search of envelopes containing £50 each.

Success: Kirsty Henderson, 26, and Kevin Wood, 28, from Canterbury, were among the lucky ones in Kent

Even writers are getting in on the act. U.S. author James Frey is offering £300,000 to the first reader who can crack the hidden code in his book The Calling, published in the UK next month.

So, why does treasure hunting exert such a magnetic pull on us?

There’s the money, of course. But it’s more than that. These latest stunts play on a long history of real and fictional trails that have excited the British for more than 150 years.

The most famous of all — and still the most influential — is that featured in Treasure Island, written in 1883 by Robert Louis Stevenson.

The original treasure hunt: Treasure Island had it all - one-legged seamen and an X that marked the spot

His novel established many of the crucial elements of the traditional buried treasure adventure: Caribbean islands, one-legged seamen and — most importantly — a map with an X that marks the spot. It begins with the young hero Jim Hawkins (as in ‘Arr, Jim Lad!’) sifting through the contents of an old sailor’s sea chest and finding a map of a faraway isle where the loot is hidden. The battle to find the haul is on.

There had been other desert island stories before it, chief among them Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, published in 1719, which told of a castaway stranded on a South American island for decades.

There had been treasure stories, too, notably Edgar Allan Poe’s The Gold-Bug, in 1843. In it, a man is bitten by a gold-coloured insect and becomes obsessed with finding treasure. Deciphering a secret message, he ends up doing exactly that.

Stevenson’s genius was to combine these different elements into the ultimate tale of fortune-hunting.

Yet it wasn’t just fiction that inspired him and sparked off our national obsession. Real pirates such as William Kidd, who is mentioned in Treasure Island, did in fact bury their loot. (Kidd’s booty, hidden on Gardiners Island in East Hampton, New York, was dug up by the authorities.)

The discoveries of the lost Roman cities of Herculaneum, in 1738, and Pompeii, in 1748, and the valuables they held, also gripped the public imagination — as did the excavation of Tutankhamun’s gold-filled tomb in Egypt in 1922.

Indeed, much of early archaeology was driven by the search for lost riches. In the late 19th century, Heinrich Schliemann, the German who excavated the ancient Greek cities of Troy and Mycenae, caused a stir by claiming to have dug up the gold mask of Greek hero Agamemnon and jewels belonging to Helen of Troy. In all likelihood, the treasure belonged to an even earlier civilisation.

Elusive: The gold bars hidden in Folkestone. But why is Britain so obsessed with the idea of hidden plunder?

Sometimes the riches haven’t been hidden so much as mislaid. Ships loaded with precious cargo, have been sinking to the bottom of the ocean since man first took to the sea, and pirates, chancers and looters have been trying to retrieve it ever since.

Stevenson’s novel refers to a famous real-life salvaged wreck: the Spanish Treasure Fleet, sunk off the coast of Florida in 1715 and later picked apart by pirates and opportunists. Among them was a privateer (a kind of government-approved mercenary) called Henry Jennings, who made off with 350,000 pieces of eight.

There are still prizes to be found. The greatest discovery of modern times is the Mary Rose, Henry VIII’s warship, which sank in the Solent in 1545 while fighting the French. In 1982, her hull and 26,000 precious artefacts were raised from the seabed — not by pirates, but a charitable trust.

The appetite for obscure clues has been around for a long time, too, with some still unsolved after centuries.

In 1820, prospector Thomas Jefferson Beale buried gold and silver in Virginia for safekeeping. He then gave three coded messages to a bar owner and promised to return with the key — but never did.

The bar owner, in turn, left the messages to a friend on his death. That friend deciphered one of them but found none of the treasure, thought to be worth £40 million today. People are still burrowing into the Virginian hills in search of it.

More recently, artist Kit Williams used elaborate pictures in his 1979 book Masquerade to give clues to the whereabouts of a hare-shaped jewel. After three years of frantic searching — during which time the book became a best-seller — it was discovered by a man called Ken Thomas.

He rushed down to its hiding place in Bedfordshire, the nation heard, to find a pile of earth dug up by two rivals who were agonisingly close to reaching the jewel — and whisked it from under their noses.

Thomas, however, turned out to be one Dugald Thompson, who knew Williams’s ex-girlfriend. She had accidentally revealed the rough location of the prize. Despite not finding it in the expected way, he got to keep the hare, which was later sold at auction by Sotheby’s for £31,900.

Today we are still a country packed with treasure-hunters, but they’re now aided by modern technology. In recent years, some staggering finds have been made, going back to the earliest British civilisations. In 2009, the Staffordshire Hoard — the largest haul of Anglo-Saxon gold and silver ever discovered — was dug up in a field near the village of Hammerwich.

Sensational: The Staffordshire Hoard, found in 2009, was the largest ever haul of Anglo-Saxon gold and silver

The 3,500 pieces, reckoned to be from the seventh or eighth century AD, are thought to have been buried by their owner with the intention of returning to claim them one day. There they lay until they were discovered by a metal-detector enthusiast searching a freshly-ploughed field.

The following year, an exceptional Roman antiquity, a rare copper alloy helmet with a griffin crest, was unturfed by another metal detective in Crosby Garrett, Cumbria. It’s thought the helmet had been hidden away in a stone box by an owner who, again, failed to return.

These ancient treasures are far more valuable than the gold bars buried at Folkestone. That Roman helmet was sold for £2.3 million, and the Staffordshire Hoard has been valued at close to £3.3 million.

The message is clear. If you want to track down a fortune, the only way forwards is backwards — start digging into the past.
