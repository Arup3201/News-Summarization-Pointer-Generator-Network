David Cameron has been accused of wasting taxpayers’ money after he used an RAF jet to fly back from his summer holiday after just one day abroad.

The Prime Minister flew to Portugal with his wife and three children on Saturday where they are enjoying a 10-day break staying in a villa.

But after just a few hours in the sun, he was yesterday flown home by the Royal Squadron so he could attend the closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games.

Jet-setting: David Cameron has been accused of wasting taxpayers' money after he used an RAF jet to fly back from his summer holiday in Portugal to attend the closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games

He will today use the RAF plane to fly to France and Belgium for the First World War commemorations before flying back to Portugal on a commercial flight at his own expense.

The Prime Minister has been criticised for not postponing his holiday for just a few days, which would have saved taxpayers thousands of pounds.

Mr Cameron’s extraordinary travel plan will see him rack up around 3,700 air miles in just three days.

Labour MP Thomas Docherty said: ‘Why couldn’t he just have booked his holiday for after these events, rather than blowing thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money jetting backwards and forwards?

Fellow colleague Steve Pound added: ‘It’s not like he didn’t know these events were happening - we’ve known the date of the First World War anniversary for 100 years.’

Mr Cameron, who has previously been accused of being too good at ‘chillaxing’, had an Easter break with his family in Lanzarote.

He and his wife will also take their traditional break to Cornwall later this summer with their children Nancy, eight, Arthur, six, and Florence, 23 months.

Last year, Mr Cameron was criticised for taking four summer holidays to Scotland, Portugal, Ibiza and Cornwall.

But he argued that he checked his BlackBerry and remained in charge of the country and ready to ‘spring into action’ no matter where he was.

Ed Miliband is set to spend a fortnight in the French countryside on holiday. His summer reading list is said to include a detective thriller by JK Rowling, a 1994 true-crime story set in the Deep South and a work by Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary.

Meanwhile Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, has already spent a week in Spain visiting his wife Miriam’s family.

He has returned to Westminster to stand in for Mr Cameron during his break, but will fly back to Spain later this month.

Downing Street said the Prime Minister is entitled to use the Royal Squadron for official business.
