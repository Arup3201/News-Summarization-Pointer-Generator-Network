Millions of Britons regularly worry that they have forgotten to switch off electrical appliances when they leave home, according to a survey.

A third of us fret at least once a week that we have left things on when rushing out the door, the study found.

Leaving the heating on (32 per cent) tops the list of the things we are anxious about, followed by hair straighteners (24), lights (23), the oven (22) and the television (19).

Millions of Britons regularly worry that they have forgotten to switch off electrical appliances when they leave home, according to a survey

The research – carried out by technology and manufacturing company Honeywell – asked 2,000 Britons about their household electronic items.

It found women worry 52 times a year about leaving something on while out of the house – three more than men, who stress 49 times.

Jeremy Peterson, general manager of Honeywell’s home comfort and energy systems division, says everyone has felt uncertain about whether they have left a gadget on.

The company behind the research said worrying about leaving appliances switched on was something 'we've all experienced'; other items people worry about are computers and electronics being left on charge

He said: ‘We’ve all experienced that feeling of being out of control and the uncertainty about whether we have left on an appliance or gadget.’

Other items we worry about include computers (18 per cent), electronics on charge (17), the iron (17), radio (6) and games consoles (5).
