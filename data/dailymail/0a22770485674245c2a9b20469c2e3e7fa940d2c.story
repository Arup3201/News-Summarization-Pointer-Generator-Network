Out late shoveling snow one night, former Nova Scotia lawmaker Charlie Parker spotted a dark object that seemed out of place in the storm.

The strange mass struggling through the snow appeared to Parker to be a seal, but when he approached it, he found a 73-year-old man in mittens and a hat with ear flaps in need of assistance.

'On behalf of all seals, I'd like to thank him for his interest,' Gerald Whitman told the BBC. 'If he hadn't been as strong as he was, I think we still would be there.'

Local hero: Former Nova Scotia lawmaker Charlie Parker thought he saw a seal struggling through a snow storm, which turned out to be Gerald Whitman attempting to escape a disabled car

'I made a wrong turn somewhere' driving to the hospital for dialysis, Whitman said, and ended up becoming trapped in the snow.

Deciding to brave the elements rather than wait in the disabled car, he squirmed out of the passenger door and started walking towards a home in the distance.

The snow was deep. Whitman's arthritic knees began to feel the toll of the weather and forced him to sit down to rest.

When he tried to stand again, his knees wouldn't let him, so he decided to crawl towards help, contemplating 'what would happen if he fell asleep.'

After an hour straining against the snow, Whitman felt he couldn't go any farther.

'I made peace with the Lord and said "If it be your will, so be it." And I just stopped,' Whitman said. 'Apparently it wasn't his will.'

Not a seal: Whitman was on his way to the hospital when his car got stuck and went out in search of help in mittens and a cap with flaps

Rescue: Parker was shoveling the driveway to make way for his son, who was returning from a night shift in the storm

It was just at that moment Whitman says Parker appeared, on an aborted seal rescue mission, and helped him to safety. 

Parker, who was out shoveling for his son returning from a night shift, took Whitman into his home, spooning coffee into his mouth because his hands couldn't hold a mug, according to the CBC. 

A plow was dispatched to clear a path for an ambulance, which took 45 minutes to make it through the storm to pick up Whitman, who was shaking uncontrollably. 

'I'm sure I didn't do anything different than anyone else would have,' Parker said.
