A suggestive letter from an inmate and a box of condoms allegedly prompted a Pennsylvania man to murder his wife and flee with his two sons Thursday, it was revealed today. 

Police say Keith Belajonas, 32, from Drexel Hill, Delaware County, shot and stabbed 28-year-old Christina Corrigan-Belajonas at their home before jumping into his car with their two sons in tow.

The husband and father later killed himself after dropping the children off with his brother.

Murdered: The body of Christina Corrigan-Belajonas, seen here with husband Keith Belajonas, was found at the couple's home in Drexel Hill with a gunshot to the head and multiple stab wounds

On Friday,
 New York Daily News reported that it was the discovery of a note from 
an inmate asking his wife for her nude pictures that he found inside her
 purse that likely sparked the bloody tragedy.

Superintendent
 Michael Chitwood of the Upper Darby indicated that it all started when 
one of the couple's young sons found a box of condoms in his mother's bag.

Belajonas then took a peek inside and came upon the racy letter from an unnamed inmate.

According to Daily News, Belajonas took to Facebook after slaying his wife and wrote: 'Had an argument. She was cheating on me. I won.'

Belajonas dragged his two sons - aged four and five - from the house, with a neighbor telling investigators they heard one of the children say: 'Is mommy dead?'

Fearing for the safety of the two boys, an Amber Alert was issued for Belajonas' gray Nissan Pathfinder about 4.30am, Pennsylvania license plate number JDH7477, setting off a three-state manhunt.

Then about 6.30am, a man matching Belajonas' description held up the CVS pharmacy along Victory Boulevard in Staten Island, about 100 miles from the crime scene.

His brother worked at the store, the Daily News reported.

Belajonas left his two children at the pharmacy, stole a case of Bud Light and some cigarettes and drove off.

About 7.30am, police surrounded Belajonas' SUV in a Staten Island street. Inside the car they found him dead.

Held up: Belajonas drove about two hours from his Pennsylvania to this CVS in Staten Island, New York, where a relative works. He robbed the pharmacy and left without his two sons

The children were taken to a hospital as a precaution, Superintended Chitwood said. They have since been released into the care of their 83-year-old great-grandfather on their mother's side.

‘Apparently
 the older of the two is telling everybody about 'Daddy killed Mommy' 
type thing. So obviously that's very traumatic for them,’ Chitwood said.

Chitwood
 said the couple married in 2011 and had lived in the house for two 
years, though neighbors indicated the Belajonases hadn't been there that
 long.

The
 husband had no criminal record in Pennsylvania and local police had 
never been called to the house for any kind of domestic incident, 
Chitwood said.

Suicide: The body of Keith Belajonas was found inside his car dead, apparently of a self-inflected gunshot wound

But he described the apartment as a 'pigpen,' with garbage and clothes strewn everywhere.‘I don't know how anybody lived in that place,’ Chitwood said.

Joe Ryan, who has lived across the street for about 40 years, said the Belajonases had generally been a quiet family who didn't socialize with anyone on the block.

But in recent days, Ryan said, loud arguments had come from their apartment, which has a balcony facing his house. He heard another commotion early Thursday that ‘sounded serious,’ but then went to bed after hearing laughter.

‘They didn't ever do anything appearing to be violent or anything like that,’ Ryan said. ‘He seemed very mild-mannered, and so did she.’
