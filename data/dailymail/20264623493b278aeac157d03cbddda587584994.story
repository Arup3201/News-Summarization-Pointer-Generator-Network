A couple of self-confessed geeks have tied the knot Seven Kingdoms of Westeros-style during a wedding ceremony based on the hit TV show Game of Thrones.

Mandie, 28, and Julian Norman, 33, who met while playing online computer games, share a love of anything fantasy-themed so decided to theme their big day around the epic series.

At a wedding ceremony at Lobo castle in Aguera Hills, California, the couple indulged their love of the HBO show in front of around 80 costumed guests.

And my sword: The couple met while playing Final Fantasy XI online and say that fantasy has always been a big part of their relationship

One ring: For the ceremony Mandie wore a tiara similar to that worn by Cate Blanchett in Lord of the Rings, along with elfin tips on her ears (left) while castle Lobo's turret and battlements made for the perfect fantasy backdrop (right)

Julian, a Coder for an online beauty and skincare company, and Mandie, a sales rep in the fashion industry decided their TV show would be a 'natural fit' for their big day.

The SyFy channel followed the couple on their romantic journey through the grim, dark and sexy world of Game of Thrones for their show My Big Fat Geek Wedding.

Groom Julian said: 'The whole Medieval and fantasy theme has always been a big part of our relationship. We met playing Final Fantasy XI online when we were both living in New York City.

'A Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings theme seemed like a natural fit for us. Mandie is a huge fan of both series and we wanted to incorporate our geek passions into the wedding.'

The bridesmaids' dresses came with a colour coordinated dragon's egg for each of them to hold - based on the eggs given to Daenerys Targaryen at her wedding in the first seasons of Game of Thrones

Some of the guests also wore bracelets themed around Drogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal - Daenerys' three dragons from the HBO show

Dracharys: An actress dressed as Emilia Clarke's character Daenerys even made an appearance at the wedding, alongside one of her fully-grown monsters

Iron Throne: The festivities even featured a replica model of the royal seat from Game of Thrones that characters compete to rule from

The bride, who wore a stunning figure hugging white gown, said the day was 'intense' but full of surprises.

Mandie said: 'The day itself was quite hectic, a wedding day is always stressful so having a film and production crew there to make sure they got the correct shots was intense.

'The day was full of surprises, Julian's fight with Khal Drogo and Legolas was a complete surprise - as was the dragon. We're both so grateful that all our friends dressed up for the event.

'It really helped to make the wedding feel immersive and like we were all party of a medieval adventure to together. I wish we had gotten more time to enjoy the day, it went by super fast. But thankfully we have the show to relive it as often as we like.'

Royal banquet: Food plays a big part in the Game of Thrones books, so it was only appropriate that Julian and Mandie were treated to a banquet of their own

In the light of the seven: After exchanging vows guests sat down to a Game of Thrones themed meal - though hopefully with less gore and murder than at wedding feasts from the show

Julian and Madie were apparently happy to get married Game of Thrones-style, despite two wedding from the TV show resulting in death and slaughter

Game of Thrones is based on author George R.R. Martin's book A Song of Ice and Fire series of books, the first of which was published in 1996.

It chronicles the members of several noble houses locked in a bitter civil war for control of the Iron Thorne and the Seven Kingdoms.

The TV show, which attracts millions of viewers each week has won several high profile awards including an Emmy Award for star Peter Dinklage, who plays Tyrion Lannister.

The day also featured a fight between Khal Drogo -from Game of Thrones and Legolas - from Lord of the Rings

In the HBO show, Drogo is a feared horse lord leading a marauding army who has never lost a duel, while Legolas is an elf warrior who takes part in some of Middle Earth's greatest battles in JRR Tolkien's novel

Julian and Mandie are obsessed with anything medieval themed, and true to form the wedding day also featured a falconry display

Lobo castle in California - reminiscent of King's Landing in Game of Thrones or Rivendell in Lord of the Rings - provided the perfect backdrop to the fantasy-themed day
