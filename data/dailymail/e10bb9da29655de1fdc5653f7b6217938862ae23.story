Hard-working joiner Dave Miller is finally hanging up his tools after refusing to take a day off sick - in almost 50 years.

Dave, 64, started work as apprentice when he was 16 in 1964 - and after suffering German measles during his training he has had a 100 per cent attendance record ever since.

The joiner started work straight after leaving school and did various joinery jobs before joining Tameside Council's maintenance team in 1980.

Hard worker: Dave Miller, 64, is retiring after 48 years without a day off sick. he started his working life aged 16 straight after leaving school

He joined the New Charter Building Company when it took over work on local authority housing. in 2000.

As the grandfather was due to retire from his job at a housing company, he said yesterday: 'Some of the days in the job haven't always been good, but I think as long as you can smile through work you haven't done too badly.

'My dad was a stickler for hard work and commitment and I learnt a lot from him - especially when it came to turning up for work.

'He used to say if you got up in the morning and have a sniffle you should just ignore it and go straight off out to work.

'I remember what he said when I left 
school. On the Friday of leaving I asked him if I would get any time off
before starting work. He said, "yes, you've got Saturday and Sunday".'

In his current role he repairs tenants' homes and carries out emergency building work.

Dave,
from Hyde, Greater Manchester, said: 'I could write a book on some of 
the things I've seen. I've met lots of different characters over the 
years.

'But it has never 
really been part of my nature to take a day off sick. It's not a 
question of being hard working - it's just taking a pride in your work. 
It's something we should all aspire to.

'I don't know what I'm going to do when I retire but I certainly won't be sitting around doing nothing.

'I just want to thank all of the 
people I've worked with on the job for all of their help over the years.
We've had some right laughs together.'

Supervisor
Paul Woodcock said: 'Whoever takes over from Dave will have very big 
boots to fill. He's one of those types of people who no job is too big 
or too small. We all wish him the best for the future.'

Director
of the New Charter Building Company John Corr said: 'Dave has made a 
fantastic contribution to our business, his attendance, quality of work 
and commitment in meeting and exceeding customers' needs have been 
superb.

'We wish him and his family all the best for a long and happy retirement.'
