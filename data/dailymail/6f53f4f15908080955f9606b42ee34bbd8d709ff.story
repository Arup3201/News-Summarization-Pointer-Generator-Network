A gang of Asian men who groomed vulnerable white girls for sex has been jailed for more than 50 years.

Police say up to 100 girls could have fallen victim to the gang led by brothers Ahdel Ali, 25, and Mubarek Ali, 29, of Wellington, Shropshire.

Over a three-year period between 2006 and 2009, the men targeted schoolgirls to control as child prostitutes by giving them alcohol, food and money.

The Ali brothers were found guilty of numerous offences against four girls aged from 13 to 17, including rape, sexual activity with a child, inciting and controlling child prostitution and trafficking children for sex.

Both married and of Pakistani heritage, they had described their victims as worthless ‘whores’, ‘slags’ and ‘sluts’.

As the major police operation came to a
 close today, police praised the victims, aged 13 to 16, for giving 
evidence at a series of court hearings, including an original trial 
which collapsed at Stafford Crown Court in September 2011.

During
 the Ali brothers’ trial, Stafford Crown Court heard the pair groomed 
two girls, aged 15 and 16, for sex before persuading them to work as 
prostitutes for them in 2008.

The
 pair were found guilty a total of 24 offences, 
including controlling child prostitution, people trafficking and sexual 
exploitation.

Ahdel Ali, was sentenced to 18 years in prison, while 
his older brother was given a 14-year jail term at Worcester Crown Court 
last October.

Five other men
 from the Telford area pleaded guilty to charges they faced prior to the
 start of their trials and were jailed for between two-and-a-half and 
seven years.

Police work: The Ali brother's sentencing at Worcester Crown Court were only part of a large criminal operation carried out by West Mercia Police to break up the child prostitution ring which saw five other men convicted

The convictions of the seven men at separate hearings have previously been reported separately, but could not be officially linked together until today’s final court hearing.

'Operation Chalice' has been one of the largest investigations in West Mercia Police history, with a team of up to 50 officers working on the inquiry to bring the men to justice.

Speaking after today's final court hearing, Detective Chief Inspector Neil Jamieson said the teenage victims were targeted because of their vulnerability.

Mr Jamieson said: ‘We are pleased with the convictions we have achieved as a result of this operation - an operation that is among the most complex West Mercia Police has ever undertaken.

‘After years of being exploited the girls then went through a huge amount during the course of this investigation, and the trials themselves were then a real ordeal for those that gave evidence.’

The officer added: ‘I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the strength and character shown by all of the victims who came and gave evidence and also thank their families for the support they have shown during what has been a truly horrible time.

‘It has been very challenging for these young women to come forward and give their evidence and I hope that these convictions will go some way to help them move on with their future lives.’
