A man was arrested Wednesday after climbing a fence at the Phoenix airport on Christmas Day and running out to a plane that had just landed.

Police say Robert Edward Bump, 49, got onto the taxiway around 5:30 p.m. and started banging on the engine of a Southwest Airlines plane.

The shocking breach was one of two that occurred Christmas day at major American airports that have made multimillion dollar perimeter upgrades in the years of heightened security concerns since September 11.

It was also the fourth such breach in ten years at the Phoenix airport, according to KPHO.

No injuries were reported, and Phoenix police Officer James Holmes said passengers were never in danger.

Police announced the breach one day after Siyah Bryant, 24, of Jersey City, New Jersey made headlines after allegedly stumbling through security a Newark International Airport while dressed in women's clothing after a 'bad date' despite the hub's reported $300 perimeter upgrade.

According to the New York Post, Bryant said he felt unsafe and left his date when the man called a friend to bring them gasoline.

Workers in the Phoenix airport's tower had spotted a man climbing the fence and running onto the tarmac and then the taxiway near Terminal 3. The pilot was alerted of the man's presence and turned off the engines before he reached the aircraft.

Surveillance video shows the man being surrounded by airport security vehicles as he wandered away from the plane with his arms outstretched as if he were flying. A police officer arrived soon after and arrested him.

Bump showed signs of drug and alcohol impairment and was booked on a misdemeanor charge of entering a restricted area at the airport, said Holmes, adding that the man didn't explain to authorities during questioning why he did it.

'He didn't really say anything that made any sense,' Holmes said.

It wasn't immediately clear whether Bump has an attorney. Police said he is homeless.

Security on the airport's runway system has been breached in the past.

In November 2012, a woman rammed through a partially open gate at the Phoenix airport and drove on the runway with her infant son in the car.

Also, Sky Harbor spent $10 million to upgrade its perimeter security and access gates after a man being chased by police in 2005 crashed a stolen pickup through a gate and drove onto the runways, passing several jets on a taxiway.

It's not known whether the airport has a perimeter intrusion detection system consisting of ground and motion sensors and closed-circuit cameras.Â 

Sky Harbor officials declined to comment on the security breach and referred questions to Phoenix police, who said they won't talk specifics about the airport's security.

A $300million dollar security system is supposed to detect any breaches on the Newark Liberty International Airport grounds

Jeff Price, an aviation professor at the Metropolitan State University of Denver and former assistant security director at Denver International Airport, said perimeter intrusion detection systems might be needed at the nation's larger airports as an extra layer, given their prominence and volume of passengers.

Still, installing such a detection system is no guarantee that breaches will be avoided. "There's no such thing as airtight security," Price said.

Price said it looked as though people working in the airport tower did as they were supposed to by responding quickly. While perimeter fences are a key part of airport security, Price said an airport relies on many layers of security, including workers required to challenge and report people on air fields who don't have security badges.
