Secret sex tapes have been handed over to a judge that allegedly contain recordings of a restaurant tycoon demanding sex from his housekeeper.

CEO of Waffle House restaurant chain Joe Rogers Jr has admitted to having an affair with his housekeeper but denies any wrongdoing against the woman.

A judge took custody of several DVDS on Wednesday in the Georgia courtroom at the request
of Rogers' lawyers, who say the woman has been trying to blackmail 
him.

The lawsuit stems from accusations made by Rogers' former employee, who cannot be identified, who says she was forced into sex. Attorneys were sorting out whether any copies of the recordings had been made on computer servers.

The former employee filed a police report saying Rogers demanded she perform sexual acts to keep her job.

Rogers said they had a consensual sexual relationship and that the woman is attempting extortion.

He told WSBTV outside court on Wednesday that he had done 'stupid things' as his wife stood by him.

Rogers said: 'I was a dumb***' to which his wife added: 'I second 
that...''

The 43-year-old woman told Atlanta 
police last month that Rogers demanded she perform sexual acts in 
exchange for keeping her job and that he also tried to force her to have
sex with him despite her repeated protests.

Accusations: Rogers' housekeeper, who cannot be identified, worked for the businessman for almost a decade before handing in her notice in June

She said that he touched 
her breasts, tried to remove her clothes, made lewd comments, appeared 
naked before her and insisted she perform sex acts on him at least once 
or twice a month.

She said this occurred for nearly a decade, from 2003 through June of this year until she handed in her resignation.Â 

Rogers identified the woman as his former housekeeper, and said she is not telling the truth.

In
a statement released on Tuesday, the restaurant tycoon said: 'I am a 
victim of my own stupidity, but I am not going to be a victim of a crime
- extortion.

'Over an 
almost eight-year period when I was separated, single and re-married, I 
had a series of infrequent, consensual sexual encounters with my 
housekeeper.

He said the woman worked for 15 hours
a week from 2003 until she was let go in 2008. He said she later was 
rehired as his house manager and quit her job in June.

'Shortly
thereafter, on July 16, 2012, I received a letter from her attorney 
containing false allegations and strong threats,' Rogers said. 
'According to her attorneys, she now wants millions of dollars from me.'

Rogers said he shared the letter from
the woman's attorney with his wife and they hired lawyers to look into 
the situation. Rogers and the woman sued each other, but documents in 
those cases were sealed.

Rogers'
attorney, Robert Ingram, said a Cobb County judge lifted a gag order in
Rogers' lawsuit Tuesday 'so Joe could get his version of the story 
out'.

Ingram said the woman made intimate videotapes involving Rogers.

Claims: The 43-year-old housekeeper told Atlanta police last month that the Waffle House CEO demanded she perform sexual acts in exchange for keeping her job

'They were tapes that [she] recorded, which is a crime in the state of Georgia to record somebody when that person had an expectation of privacy and doesn't consent to the recording,' Ingram said.

David Cohen, the woman's attorney, said: 'We understand he's obviously trying to spin his wrongful actions in some positive light.

'We believe attempting to attack the victim will only make matters worse and that the parties just need to let a jury decide the issues. Our position and facts as they have evolved thus far are stated in our verified counterclaim filed in the courthouse, which is part of the record unsealed by the court today.'

In the police report, the woman identified herself as a single mother. She said she stayed in the job and submitted to Rogers because she couldn't find other employment with comparable pay.

She said she gave Rogers a letter of resignation in June after her son secured a full college scholarship.

Rogers said he was wrong to have sex with the woman during a period when he was separated and later remarried.

'That was wrong of me and I am very sorry for the pain and embarrassment I've caused my wife and family. There is no excuse for what I have done,' he said.

He added, 'As personally embarrassing as this situation is for me, I am committed to the legal and law enforcement process to expose the motives of my former housekeeper and her attorneys.'

Rogers' opened his first waffle house in Atlanta in 1955, growing the company into a major chain of 1,500 restaurants throughout the South.
