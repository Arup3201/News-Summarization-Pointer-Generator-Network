A former police community support officer was arrested yesterday over an alleged plot to carry out a major terrorist attack, possibly during the Olympics.

Jahangir Alom, 26, who spent two years working for the Metropolitan Police, was among six people detained over an alleged plan to cause an atrocity in the UK.

The former 'Blunkett bobby' and his two younger brothers were arrested at 4am at their family home half a mile from the Olympic Park in Stratford, East London.

A white Muslim convert, Richard Dart, 
29, who once worked as a BBC security guard, was among three other 
suspects taken into custody elsewhere.

In April last year Dart, using the 
name Salahuddin Al Britani, appeared in an internet video uploaded by a 
Muslim group, which vowed to disrupt the wedding of Prince William and 
Kate Middleton.

A woman aged 30 and man of 21 were 
arrested at separate homes in West London yesterday, on suspicion of 
being part of the terrorist plot.

Last night the suspects' alleged 
targets were unclear, as was how it is alleged they planned to strike.

But security sources described the arrests 'as very significant' and 
counter-terrorism chiefs are convinced they have thwarted a major 
attack.

Yesterday's developments followed 
months of surveillance and a recent, worrying increase in intelligence 
'chatter', prompting fears of an attack to coincide with the Olympics 
and Paralympics.

It is not thought that the suspects 
were intending to target Games' venues or spectators.

But detectives 
fear Islamic radicals will try to maximise publicity with an attack – 
anywhere in Britain – during the next two months.

Terror alert: Two police officers on duty outside the property in Stratford

Jahangir Alom and his brothers Moybur 
Alom, 18, and Alomgir Alom, 24, were arrested at the semi-detached 
council home they share with their mother in Abbey Road, Stratford, East
London.

One of the men was Tasered as dozens 
of armed officers threw 'flash bang' grenades and stormed into their 
family home. Neighbours screamed as police dressed in black 
paramilitary-style clothing smashed down doors and smoke poured from the
windows.

One said: 'I asked one police officer what was going on and he said it was an Olympic exercise.'

Terror threat: During the Games the Olympic Park will be protected by the biggest peacetime security operation ever seen in Britain. The arrests were not linked to the games

All three brothers are British nationals from a large Bangladeshi family and attended the local Rokerby High School.

Their father, Sheikh Alkas Ali, a chef, is understood to have returned to Bangladesh, where he and his wife were both born.

The arrested men's brother-in-law 
Salim Ahmed said they had once been acquaintances of radical preacher 
Anjem Choudary. Jahangir also appeared in a Channel 4 documentary, My 
Brother The Islamist, in which he drove several men to a meeting at a 
mosque in Leeds.

Jahangir spent two years working as a 
Metropolitan Police community support officer in East London, before 
leaving the force in May 2009.

In a nine-minute interview posted on 
YouTube, Jahangir – using the name Abu Khalid – said he once harboured 
ambitions to become a chief inspector but later quit the police.

His arrest was part of a London-wide 
terrorist operation that saw Dart detained in the street and a man and 
woman held at their home in Ealing, West London.

Dart is a Muslim convert who 
criticised Britain on TV while claiming benefits to live rent-free. He 
also appeared in the documentary My Brother The Islamist, alongside 
Jahangir Alom.

A total of eight homes across London were being searched last night as officers looked for evidence of a plot.

Scotland Yard said five men and one 
woman were arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation or 
instigation of acts of terrorism under the Terrorism Act 2000.

'Public 
safety remains our overriding concern. Today's operation in London is 
not linked to the Olympic and Paralympic games,' a spokesman added.

The suspects can be detained for 14 days before officers must charge or release them.
