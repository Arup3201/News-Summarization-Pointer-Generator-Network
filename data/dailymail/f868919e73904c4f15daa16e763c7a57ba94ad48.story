They were the two best friends who decided - after finding themselves single at the same time -  to date for 40 days to see what happened.

But whatever happened to Jessica Walsh, 28, and Timothy Goodman, 34, whose story went viral in 2013 - did they find their happily ever after?

Well, Jessica certainly did, only the bad news for Timothy is, it was with another man!

Best friends Jessica Walsh and Timothy Goodman dated for 40 days in 2013. The pair blogged about their experience and wrote a book, 40 Days Of Dating which is out now

New York-based designers Jessica and Timothy decided to embark upon their 40 day experiment two years ago after finding themselves partner-less. 

The couple, who described themselves as complete opposites - she's the hopeless romantic and he's a charming lothario - would then share their experiences in a series of blogs. 

However, despite the fact that there was clearly some chemistry between the two and they even ended up sleeping together (on day 25) their relationship didn't work out.   

In fact just one month after their time together Jessica met her husband, cinematographer Zac Mulligan.

But while she and Timothy might not have gone the distance some good did come out of their 40 days together.

They have now turned their story into a book to be released this month named 40 Days Of Dating: The Experiment and it's already been optioned for a movie.

Just a month after her 40 days was up  Jessica met cinematographer Zac Mulligan, who she went on to marry

Speaking of the experience, which both Jessica and Timothy have previously described as a positive one, Jessica said the pair had wanted to iron out their relationship issues.  

'Tim was a commitment-phobe and I was a hopeless romantic,' Jessica told news.com.au.

'I had just gotten out of a relationship and was heartbroken. Tim had the exact opposite issue where he was dating five girls at once and couldn't commit. We were like, 'What's wrong with us? How can we fix this?'

The couple decided to date for 40 days. As part of the agreement they'd  see each other every day and even take a weekend break together. They also decided that they wouldn't date anyone else while taking part.

They now admit that they had definitely been attracted to one another and that their pals had been worried about what might happen to their friendship.

Tim said: 'When we told our friends about it they were really against it, because we did have a great friendship and they were worried that we could ruin our friendship and end up hating each other.

'Now when we look back on it there was definitely a part of us that was attracted to each other, but we were too afraid to admit that to each other because we were such good friends.'

And Jessica says the experiment changed her for the better and that her new husband - who happily allowed Tim to come to their wedding - doesn't mind that the two once dated. 

'I learned to just be myself and not worry so much,' said Jessica. 'After the experiment I was in a really good mindset and just having fun with it all. 

'I told him [her husband] about what Tim and I had done. At that point the blog wasn’t live yet. He’s a creative person too and he thought it was a really cool idea.'

Tim is still single but says he's now a lot more 'open and vulnerable'.
