Dave Whelan’s future as the chairman of Wigan Athletic was shrouded in uncertainty on Friday night after he accepted an FA misconduct charge for his comments about the Chinese and Jewish communities.

Whelan said he would resign if found guilty by the governing body and some form of punishment for his comments is sure to follow after he submitted a detailed response ahead Friday’s deadline.

In trying to justify his controversial appointment of Malky Mackay as manager, at a time when Mackay remains the subject of an FA investigation into an exchange of racist, homophobic and sexist messages, Whelan is alleged to have made insulting remarks about the Chinese and Jews in a newspaper interview.

The 78-year-old was quoted saying ‘Jewish people do chase money more than everybody else’ while also arguing there was ‘nothing’ offensive about the term ‘chink’.

Whelan will now have to appear before an independent FA disciplinary commission, but the fact that he has admitted to the charge would leave him open to accusations of hypocrisy if he does not now stand down as chairman.

Last month he said he would resign, with his grandson David Sharpe expected to take over.

Whelan said: ‘If the FA look into my affairs — and they were to find me guilty, which I hope they don’t and I don’t see anything like that happening because I’m absolutely anti-racist, always have been, always will be — however, if they have any questions I’m willing to answer it and, should they even suggest I’m guilty, I would immediately resign from my position as chairman of Wigan Athletic.’

On Friday night, Whelan was unavailable for comment, while the club’s media officer said Wigan would not be saying anything on the matter. The FA also declined to comment.

But the situation only puts Mackay under more pressure after an already difficult start.

If he now loses the man who appointed him at a time when he could yet be facing an FA charge, it will only create further difficulties for the former Cardiff manager.

Whelan could be hit with a ban as well as a heavy fine.

If Mackay, who along with his former Cardiff colleague Iain Moody is still the subject of an FA investigation, is also charged and then banned, it could also cause huge embarrassment to Wigan. Cardiff owner Vincent Tan has already spoken of a ‘racist chairman hiring a racist manager’.
