In an age of overpaid, badly-behaved sporting stars, amateur cricket has long remained a reassuringly calm oasis.

So the sight of four players sitting 
on their own bowler to physically restrain him after a furious clash 
with the batsman had spectators aghast.

The shocking incident – at the club 
where a big-hitting young Andrew Flintoff made his name by peppering 
nearby rooftops – saw the umpires take the drastic step of abandoning 
the match.

Just not cricket: St Annes was the scene of unsightly behaviour during a match recently

But after filing a report on the 
appalling scenes, the highly experienced pair were astonished to be told
it was they who were being suspended – a decision one described as 
‘Stalinist’.

It left the Lancashire-based Northern
League – also graced by the likes of Javed Miandad, Jimmy Adams and 
Stuart MacGill over the years – facing a boycott by its officials next 
summer.

The clash took place during a 
meaningless but bad-tempered end-of-season match between St Annes and Preston second XIs on September 10.

Tempers were already bubbling over 
when Preston bowler Yasin Patel – believed to be the son of the club 
chairman – barged into an opposing batsman.

‘The bowler just lost the plot,’ said
one witness. ‘He tore his shirt off and came stalking down the pitch 
and began threatening the batsman.’

Umpires Ken Shenton and Steve Godfrey
– both former public school teachers – felt they had no choice but to 
abandon the match, the first time this had happened in the league’s 
60-year history.

But after sending a report to 
Northern League officials, they were notified by its secretary that they
were being suspended indefinitely.

Yesterday Mr Shenton, who has umpired
for 35 years, said he had been astounded by the ruling – which wasn’t 
within the league’s powers in any case.

'The whole thing's been like a Stalinist show trial'

‘It was the worst behaviour I’ve ever
seen on a cricket field,’ said the 63-year-old. ‘With hindsight, we 
should have called the police and let them deal with it.

‘The whole thing’s been like a 
Stalinist show trial. We weren’t told action was being taken against us,
and we haven’t been given reasons for our suspension.’

Last night, however, the chairman of 
the league, Norman Poole, who also headed the disciplinary panel, 
informed the umpires they weren’t suspended after all.

Promising they had his ‘full 
respect’, he emailed both, asking: ‘Please accept my apologies if the 
incorrect impressions have emerged in this matter.’

But Tommy Wilson, chairman of the Northern League Cricket Umpires Federation, said: 'It's all very unsatisfactory.

'The secretary should apologise and resign, otherwise we'll have to take further action.'

Preston Cricket Club said Patel had been suspended but would not say for how long.
