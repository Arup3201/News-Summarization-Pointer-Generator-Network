Former neighbourhood watch captain George Zimmerman's attorney says a website created to raise money for his legal defense has raised more than $200,000 in donations.

Mark O'Mara said on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 Thursday night that he learned about the money on Wednesday and will inform a judge at a Friday hearing.

Zimmerman, who has been charged with second-degree murder in the February 26 shooting of Trayvon Martin, was released from jail this week after paying 10 percent of $150,000 bail.

Sprung: George Zimmerman is now in hiding after his release from jail in Seminole County, Florida, after he posted bail

Lawyer: Zimmerman's attorney Mark O'Mara told CNN on Thursday night that his client has informed him that a website he set up collected more than $200,000 for his legal defence fund

O'Mara says the bail amount may have been higher if the judge knew Zimmerman had raised $200,000.

The website used to raise the money has since been shut down, but O'Mara said he'll likely start a new defense fund for Zimmerman.

O'Mara did not immediately return a Thursday evening phone message by The Associated Press.

Zimmerman was released from jail shortly after midnight on Sunday.

His current whereabouts are being kept secret for his safety and he is very likely outside of Florida.

Defence: George Zimmerman has set up this website to raise funds for his legal costs and living expenses. It was later shut down, but not before it collected more than $200,000

Out: It's not known where Zimmerman will stay 
until his trial in the murder of Trayvon Martin

Judge
Lester said at a hearing Friday he cannot have any guns and must 
observe a 7pm-to-6am curfew. Zimmerman also surrendered his passport.

Zimmerman had to put up 10 per cent, or $15,000, to make bail. His father had indicated he might take out a second mortgage.

He worked at a mortgage risk-management company at the time of the shooting and his wife Shellie is in nursing school.

Bail is not unheard of in second-degree 
murder cases, and legal experts had predicted it would be granted for 
Zimmerman because of his ties to the community, because he turned 
himself in after he was charged last week, and because he has never been
convicted of a serious crime.

Walking out: Zimmerman's ultimate destination is being kept secret for his safety and it is very likely outside of Florida

Speaking at his bail hearing last week, Zimmerman, 28, apologised to Trayvon's parents, coming face-to-face
with the victim's family for the first time.

He said: 'I am sorry for 
the loss of your sonâ€¦ I did not know if he was armed or not.'

Addressing Trayvon Martin's family directly Zimmerman said: 'I did not know how old he was. I thought he was a little bit older than I was'.

The 28-year-old is charged with second degree murder for the February 26 killing of the 17-year-old Martin.

Zimmerman told cops that he spotted Martin while on patrol in his neighbourhood, which had been plagued by burglaries in vandalism in recent months, and called 911 to report a suspicious 
person.

Victim: Zimmerman insists that he was acting in self-defence after Trayvon attacked him

'This guy looks like he is up to no good. He is on drugs or something,' Zimmerman told the dispatcher from his sport utility vehicle.

He added that the teen had his hand in his waistband and was walking around looking at homes.

'These a*******. They always get away,' Zimmerman was heard saying on the 911 call.

But Trayvon was not armed. He was returning from a convenience store with an iced tea for himself and a bag of skittles for his little brother.

A neighbour said there had been 
several break-ins in the community in the past year, including one in 
which burglars took a TV and laptops.

A
dispatcher told Zimmerman to stay in his sport utility vehicle and that
an officer would be there momentarily, but Zimmerman - for unknown 
reasons - got out.

March: Thousands have protested over Trayvon's killing, which many see as racially motivated

Zimmerman told police he lost sight of the teenager and was walking back to his vehicle when he was suddenly attacked.

He claims he shot the teen in self-defence.

Zimmerman's case may have improved 
slightly with the release of a new photograph, showing the back of 
Zimmerman's bleeding head following the incident.

The photo, obtained and released exclusively by ABC News, shows blood 
trickling from the crown of Zimmerman's head. ABC News notes that the 
blood is likely coming from two gashes.

The police report from the night of February 26 also noted that Zimmerman was bleeding from his nose.

However, Zimmerman was not sent to the hospital, nor did he receive 
stitches. Rather, he was treated by paramedics and brought in for 
questioning.
