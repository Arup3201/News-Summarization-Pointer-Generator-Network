A top Tory has been secretly recorded dismissing 'dog-end voters' in the north who want higher taxes on the rich.

Former banker Mark Garnier said appealing to poor families in 'the outlying regions of the country' risked damaging the economy.

Mr Garnier - a member of the powerful Commons Treasury Committee – made the shock remarks during a meeting in Westminster.

Tory MP Mark Garnier referred to some voters as 'dog end'

A tape the sneering remarks was recorded and passed to The Sun newspaper.

It comes after Plebgate Tory Andrew Mitchell was found guilty of launching a foul-mouthed tirade at Downing Street police officers.

Ex cabinet minister David Mellor was also recorded ranting at a taxi driver just days after Labour's shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry was sacked for sending a 'sneering' tweet about a white van owner with England flags.

Mr Garnier was speaking at the Institute of Economic Affairs debating taxes on the rich.

The 51-year-old MP for Wyre Forest said businessmen were being put off by government's hiking their taxes to appeal to poorer voters.

Mr Garnier said entrepreneurs were 'worried about what is going to happen to their own personal rates of tax'.

He added: 'We need to be giving a much clearer message to them that they don't have to worry about politicians mucking around with tax rates in order to try and attract a few, sort, of dog-end voters in the outlying regions of the country.'

He then added: 'Not that they are not important – but what is important, what is important, is that businesses can feel surety in what is happening within tax rates.'

Labour said remarks revealed the 'true face' of the Conservative party.

Former Conservative cabinet minister David Mellor called a taxi driver a 'sweaty, stupid little s***'

Jon Ashworth said: 'Today's latest embarrassment from a Tory MP exposes the reality that the 'nasty party' never really changed.

'The truth is that David Cameron's claims to lead a compassionate Conservative Party are now as robust as his deficit reduction timetable.

'He has failed to modernise his party, just as he has failed to deliver his pledge to balance the nation's finances.'

'I hope Mr Garnier can now explain to thousands upon thousands of our hardworking constituents why he considers them 'dog-end voters'?

'I fear the truth is the Tories' economic failure and this high-handed dismissal of working people are intrinsically linked. Recent outbursts from Lord Freud, David Mellor, Andrew Mitchell and now Mark Garnier show just how out of touch David Cameron's party has become.'

Mr Ashworth added: 'If the Tories understood hardworking Britain, if they understood that the people holding down multiple jobs to make ends meet are not the 'dog end' but the engines of our economy, this wouldn't be their record in government.

'When George Osborne stands up tomorrow we know that he will seek to mask a record of economic failure that is now all too apparent for everyone to see.

'But what he will not be able to escape is that the mask is slipping on a Tory Party who stands up for a privileged few because they simply don't understand hardworking Britain.'

Mr Garnier issued a full grovelling apology last night. He said: "If I used slack language in order to make a point, I am sorry if I caused any offence to anybody.

"Certainly no offence is intended. I believe every voter is important everywhere."
