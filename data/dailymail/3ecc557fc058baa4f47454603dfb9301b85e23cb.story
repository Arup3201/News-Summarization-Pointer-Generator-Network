Marissa, Marissa, Marissa: Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer's looks may be one explanation as to why her career has been so successful

In Marissa Mayer's first year as the head of Yahoo, the company saw a stock price boost of 74.6 per cent. While some may point to Mayer's leadership skills or many years at rival Google as reasons for the company' s recent boom, there's always another explanation to consider: her looks. 

Ever since Richard Nixon lost to John Kennedy in their televised presidential debates, scholars have been pondering whether attraction has something to do with success - an academic field of study called Pulchrinomics.

The New Yorker references a working paper released by researchers at the University of Wisconsin last month which seems to bolster the idea that pretty people have it easier.The Wisconsin researchers studied the 677 CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, and how stock prices were impacted for the five days after their appointments were announced.

The CEO's headshots were run through a program that calculates attraction based on seventeen facial criteria, and for each point of attraction on a ten-point scale, the CEOs' companies noticed a once per cent boost in stock price. Those results seem to confirm an earlier study published in 1994 by Daniel Hamermesh - the father of pulchrinomics - and economist Jeff Biddle.

Skyrocketed: In the year after Mayer's appointment to the position of CEO at Yahoo, prices in the company went up 74.6 per cent. Scholars of Pulchrinomics would say her attractiveness helped boost the company's stock value

For the 1994 study, Hamermesh and Biddle evaluated data on thousands of U.S. and Canadian workers from the late 1970s.

Each worker was given an attraction rating, and researchers found that workers who were rated above average for attraction earned a five per cent premium over just average-rated workers.

That difference translated to the average-rated workers who made 10 per cent more than the below-average attractive workers.

Researchers also discovered that the above-average attractive workers tended to have jobs which capitalized off their looks in some way.

Pretty people win: Ever since Nixon 'lost' to Kennedy in the 1960 televised presidential debates, scholars have been wondering about the connection between attractiveness and success

The problem with beautiful people making more money is that it goes against the American idea that all you need to do is work hard to achieve success. 

But that's still true in one important way. While Hamermesh believes attraction does have a positive impact on earnings, there's still one great equalizer that trumps a pretty face: education.

Hamermesh says that 'each additional year of education represents a ten per cent increase in earning potential'.

It's true - those with a master's degree earn on average 400,000 more in a lifetime than those with just a bachelor's degree.

So if you're not a looker, just keep your head in the books.
