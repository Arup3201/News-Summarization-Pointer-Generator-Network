He was livid, spinning towards Kevin Friend and telling the fourth official exactly why Diafra Sakho shouldn’t have been able to crash home the late winner. Dick Advocaat then grumpily crossed his arms in acceptance. Referees are going to get to know this man over the next two months.

On his first public outing in England, Advocaat was nothing if not eccentric, incapable of remaining still for longer than a few seconds. His gesticulations were constant, nervous energy overt. Staying slumped in his cushy Upton Park dug out just wasn’t an option for the Sunderland coach.

Keeping Sunderland up looks like being the pensioner’s toughest job in a long managerial career and — despite an understated entrance to the Premier League in which no photographer deemed it necessary to capture an image of him before kick-off — Advocaat felt the need to show those loyal band of travelling supporters in the Sir Trevor Brooking stand that he means business.

Dick Advocaat was left disappointed as Sunderland fell to a 1-0 defeat at West Ham in his first game in charge

The Dutchman may only have the job for nine matches but he is insistent on stamping his authority on a rag-tag squad who would not fight for previous incumbent Gus Poyet.

The signs are positive for the struggling club and Advocaat must surely have left east London with a sense of satisfaction that his message has been heeded in a matter of days, even if his team failed to hold out.

Advocaat is acutely aware that his body language resonates with those wearing the club’s colours before him. Even at 67, the basics still enthuse him.

Jordi Gomez, normally little more than a luxury midfielder, was one shining example of the difference between Poyet and now.

Advocaat almost leapt in celebration when Gomez left his central station to shut down Aaron Cresswell during what appeared an innocuous patch of play. For him, that epitomised tangible change amid the serious problems he inherited. First battle won. The second, of course, is finding someone who can actually stick the ball in the net. 

One goal in seven games, dating back to February 7, is laughably abysmal. So it was understandable that Advocaat opted for three up front in Connor Wickham, Steven Fletcher and Jermain Defoe. Less cautious than fellow countryman Louis van Gaal but every bit as passionate, he clasped his ears in frustration at Defoe’s galling, first-half miss.

Advocaat looked as if he was living on the edge, a characteristic typified by introducing Adam Johnson with 17 minutes remaining. The winger, recalled from suspension, was booed and subjected to a volley of disparaging chants, but that matters little to his manager. 

Results are paramount from now until May 24. Advocaat will try to earn those wins while hopping about on the touchline.

Advocaat faces a difficult challenge to keep Sunderland in the Premier League and has eight games to do it
