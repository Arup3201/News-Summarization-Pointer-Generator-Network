A newly released police interview video shows George Zimmerman's girlfriend describing in detail how the former neighborhood watch volunteer pointed a shotgun at her face and choked her last month.

Weeks later, Samantha Scheibe recanted her story, saying she felt intimidated by police and coerced into saying that Zimmerman threatened her. Prosecutors subsequently declined to charge Zimmerman and the couple were seen retrieving his guns together, smiling. 

But on November 19, as Ms Scheibe sat with a Sanford, Florida, police detective, she calmly said that Zimmerman retrieved his pump-action shotgun from a weapons bag and pointed at it from just a few feet away when she threatened to call police.

The 27-year-old blonde also told a story, with no prompting, about how Zimmerman choked her during a fight a week and a half earlier - wrapping his hands around her throat until she had trouble breathing and her voice became hoarse.

Happy together? Weeks after the interview, Ms Scheibe recanted her story. She was seen walking with Zimmerman outside the Sanford, Florida, police station after prosecutors announced he would not be charged

When asked why she didn't call the police that time, Ms Scheibe responded: 'Because I feel like he always gets off, to be honest.'

Zimmerman, 30, has been in the public eye since February 2012, when he shot and killed unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin. He was acquitted of all charged this summer after claiming acted in self defense.

In the interview, Ms Scheibe describes how the couple began to fight after she told Zimmerman she was kicking him out of her house. He began to pack his things, including two firearms, an AR15 assault rifle and a Kel-Tec pump shotgun.

'As I started to move his stuff out, he got agitated. He went to the rifle bag, he unlocked it, immediate pulled out the first gun in the bag, which is on top, which is the Kel-Tec,' she told the detective.

'He pointed it at me for a second and said 'Do you really want to do this?' Because I'd told him that I'd call the cops.

'He was trying to scare me out of not calling.'

In the interview, Scheibe said Zimmerman pointed his Kel-Tec shotgun (pictured) at her. She wasn't sure whether it was loaded or not

At the request of the detective, she took and demonstrated with her hands how Zimmerman pointed the weapon at her. She said she didn't know whether it was loaded and estimates he was about four feet from her at the time.

The interview reveals a tumultuous relationship between Zimmerman and Ms Scheibe, who have been seeing each other since August. She says this wasn't the first time she had threatened the kick Zimmerman out of her house.

In September, Zimmerman's wife Shellie - who stood by his side and hid out with him during the Trayvon Martin trial - announced that she was divorcing Zimmerman. Also in September, he was detained by police after an altercation with Shellie in which she claimed he threatened her and her father with a gun.

He was not charged, though, because he allegedly smashed her iPad, which contained video of the incident.

Ms Scheibe says the fight started because Zimmerman was jealous of her ex-boyfriend.

'He was jealous over my ex,' she told the detective.

'Because (the ex-boyfriend) had been texting me and I'd been responding because he's not biologically the father of my daughter, but he's been dad to her for ten years. We were together eight year.'

In his fury, she says, Zimmerman used the butt of the shotgun to smash her glass coffee table and her sunglasses, which her ex-boyfriend had given to her.

He then pointed the shotgun at her a second time and shoved her out the front door of her own house, slammed the door and locked out her, she said.

When the detective asked whether Ms Scheibe felt afraid of Zimmerman, she responded: 'Yes and no.

Strained: Scheibe said she had previously threatened to kick Zimmerman out of her house - but never actually went through with it

Ms Scheibe, a 27-year-old single mother, has been dating Zimmerman since August

Zimmerman and wife Shellie are in the process of divorcing. She announced she was leaving him in September - though he's been seeing Scheibe since August

'No because he's locked up right now.

'Yes because he just lost the only person that had his back so he's got nothing to lose.'

In the end of the interview, after the detective leaves the room, Ms Scheibe can be heard telling a victim advocate, 'I feel like I've been through this a hundred times and I get so scared that I'm leavign something out.'

Days after the interview, Zimmerman's lawyer filed an affidavit signed by Ms Scheibe.

In it, she says, 'I do not want George Zimmerman charged.'

'When I was being questioned by police I felt very intimidated...I believe that the police misinterpreted me and that I may have misspoken about certain facts in my statement to police.'

She said that Zimmerman never threatened her or pointed a gun at her. She adds that she 'wants to be with' him.

Prosecutors subsequently announced that they would not file charges against Zimmerman.

The pair are believed to still be together.
