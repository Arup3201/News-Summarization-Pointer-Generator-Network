The Florida man accused of murdering former NFL star Sean Taylor during a botched 2007 robbery told jurors Monday he was coerced by police into confessing – that he’s not a killer.

Eric Rivera, 17-years-old when the footballer was shot dead in his Miami Home, argued he never left the SUV his friends took to the home. He had no idea anyone had been shot until the band of thieves rushed back to the SUV and sped away, he claimed.

This shocking insistence comes after he admitted to police that he shot Mr Taylor and tossed the gun in the Everglades on the way home, the Miami Herald reported, detailing the accused killer’s testimony.

'I didn't do it': Eric Rivera takes the stand in his own defense during his murder trial

Mr Rivera, on the stand testifying in his own defense, denied knowing why the group took the drive from Fort Myers, on Florida’s west coast, to Miami, where Mr Taylor lived.

Mr Taylor played for the University of Miami prior to joining the NFL’s Washington Redskins.‘Did I know we were going to Sean Taylor’s house? No,’ Mr Rivera asserted.

The 24-year-old then told jurors he only learned of the plot as the SUV sped across Alligator Alley. Vowing he wanted no money from the caper, he never left the vehicle, Mr Rivera added.

Mr Rivera maintained that he only learned of the shooting after his three friends raced back to the truck, and claimed Venjah Hunte was the shooter.

Mr Hunt has already pleaded guilty for his part in the robbery gone wrong, the paper noted.

Due to face what is expected to be a tough cross-examination Tuesday, Mr Rivera’s testimony was an effort to prove he pressed by police to falsely confess, according to the paper.

Mr Taylor died as a result of massive blood loss after being shot in the leg, a murder that horrified football fans and non-fans alike.

Authorities have long asserted Mr Rivera is the one who fired the bullet into Mr Taylor’s leg, a claim he now denies.

Investigators taped a confession that showed Mr Rivera admitting to the killing, and to tossing the murder weapon into the Everglades, a vast expanse of Florida swampland.

Officials pieced together a scenario that has Mr Rivera and company ambushing the football player in his home – they did not expect him to be there.

Mr Taylor grabbed a machete to protect his infant daughter and girlfriend, leading to him being shot, said investigators.

Initially confessing to the crime, Mr Rivera now says he did it only under intense pressure from police.

‘I was concerned about my moms. I was concerned about my family,’ Rivera testified. ‘It was to the point that I felt like it wasn’t going to stop.’

Police disputed those accusations.

The trial resumed Tuesday and is expected to last at least a few more days.
