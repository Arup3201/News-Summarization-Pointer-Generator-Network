It is regarded as one of the world's most beautiful and valuable sports cars.

And in honour of the legendary Jaguar D-Type - which won Le Mans in 1956 and 1957 - the British car maker has today unveiled this impressive new 186mph car.

The single-seat Jaguar Project 7, which was inspired by the firm's legendary Le Mans winners, has  incredibly gone from a sketchpad to the racetrack in just four months.

Respected: The Jaguar D-Type is regarded as one of the world's most beautiful and valuable sports cars. It won Le Mans between 1956 and 1957. It is the inspiration behind the British car maker's new vehicle

Based on the new F-Type, engineers have modified the bodywork, giving it a number of lightweight and aerodynamic adjustments, including a 'fairing' behind the driver - a famous feature on the iconic D-Type.

Project 7, which acknowledges Jaguar's seven Le Mans victories between 1951 and 1990, also shares the D-Types' paint job.

But there is no room for a passenger's seat either, with this removed and replaced with a special space for the driver's race helmet.

Under the bonnet is a 5-litre, supercharged V8 engine which boasts a whopping 540bhp.

Power
fed to the car's massive 20-inch wheels comes through an eight-speed gearbox.

This gives the sports car a 0-62mph time of 4.1 seconds and an 
electronically-limited top speed of 186mph.

The team at Jaguar were under pressure to design and build Project 7 with the one-off motor completed in just four months under the guidance of Ian Callum, the design boss.

Mr Callum, who has been behind some of the greatest recent British cars, today described Project 7 as being the 'kind of racing-inspired form that designers dream about'.

He added: 'It has one purpose: to be driven fast and enjoyed. Jaguar sports cars are known for exceptional performance and clean design. Project 7 captures that spirit in its purest form.'

Project 7, which is a concept for now, will make its debut at this weekend's Goodwood Festival of Speed in Sussex.

It started off as an experimental sketch by designer Cesar Pieri, with Callum giving it the thumbs up to take it further.

Four months' later, Mike Cross, chief engineer at Jaguar, is preparing to drive it at Goodwood.

Mr Cross said: 'The overriding dynamic aim when developing F-Type was ensuring connected feel; it's a true, driver-focused sports car; agile, immediate, fast and, of course, fun.

'Having achieved that for the road, Project 7 has given us a unique opportunity to go that little bit further.

Reality: Project 7 started off as an experimental sketch

'It is visceral in every sense - its 
response, its sound and its sheer performance. I'm very much looking 
forward to driving it at Goodwood.'

Mr Callum added: 'When you look at this car, it has got an enormous amount of appeal. It's just full of desire - you can see that its sole purpose is to be enjoyed.

'Project 7 is a very special car - not just because it's a one-off, but because of its purity of purpose. It is pure Jaguar.'
