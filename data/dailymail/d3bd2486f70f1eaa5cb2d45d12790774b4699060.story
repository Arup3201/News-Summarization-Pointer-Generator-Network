Google Australia has joined an international campaign to honour Phillip Hughes, who died  after being knocked out by a bouncer in a game in Sydney on Tuesday.

The search engine has decorated its home page with a simple image of a bat leaning against a wall, a nod towards the '#putoutyourbats' social media campaign in honour of the cricketer.

The touching tribute comes as cricket fans all over the world have come together to remember Phillip Hughes by placing out their bat and cricket cap out the front of their homes as a sign of respect. 

Mourners from as far as the US, Europe and the Middle East have united in posting pictures of their tributes to social media with the hashtag #putoutyourbats.

Around Australia, families, cricket legends, celebrities, universities, companies and media organisations have set up touching tributes to the 25-year-old batsman, who died in a Sydney hospital on Thursday surrounded by families, friends and team-mates.

The simple tribute was thought up by dad and IT worker Paul Taylor, who posted a poignant image of his bat out the front of his home on social media.

'#putoutyourbats isn't about me,' Taylor said, after the tribute took off. 'It's just a way for all cricketers to show their respects to Phillip Hughes. 

'We've all played cricket in one way or another. Backyard or beach cricket, no matter what level, we've all grown up with a bat and ball.

'This is our way to connect and show our sadness. Thoughts also must go to Sean Abbott. Thank you.'   

Among the most poignant tributes included a lone bat, which was placed out the front of Sydney Cricket Ground, featuring the simple inscription:  'RIP P. Hughes 63 not out forever'.

Cricket Australia has lined 63 bats in the windows of its headquarters - the number of runs Hughes had on the board when he tragically collapsed to the ground on Thursday. 

Fans overseas joined in, including in Massachusetts in the US (pictured), Europe and the Middle East

Pictures have been posted to Twitter and Instagram from all over Australia.

Others placed their bats out in the snow in Massachusetts and Illinois in the US, or made do with Cricket Australia stubbie holders if they were lacking a cricket bat overseas.

Legends of the cricketing world, including Ian Chappell, Sachin Tendulkar, Ian Botham, Shane Warne and Adam Gilchrist have paid tribute to the opener whose guts and determination defined his all-too-brief, yet spectacular, career. 

'Just an absolute tragedy that Hughesy is no longer with us. He was such an awesome young man, RIP buddy, shattered...' came the tweet from spin-king Shane Warne.

Fast bowler and long-time team-mate Brett Lee said: 'No words can describe the loss'. 

A devastated David Warner posted a photograph of himself embracing Hughes with the words: 'RIP my little man. You will always be with me when I walk out onto the field. Not just a mate but a loved one to us all big man. Forever in my heart brother for life. Miss you buddy.'
