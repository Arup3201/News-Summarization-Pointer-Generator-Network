Controversial: Britain's top military academy, Sandhurst, has come under fire for renaming a sports hall commemorating a First World War battle after the King of Bahrain. British soldiers are pictured at Mons

Britain’s top military academy, Sandhurst, has come under fire for renaming a sports hall commemorating a First World War battle after the King of Bahrain.

The Mons Hall – named after the 1914 battle where thousands died  – will have its name changed to  honour the Bahraini monarch who has given millions in funding to the Army’s officer training college.

The building will now be called King Hamad Hall and will reopen next month after being refurbished thanks to a £3 million donation from the king, who is the patron of the Sandhurst Foundation but is known for brutally repressing demonstrators at home.

Sandhurst has also accepted a  £15 million donation from the United Arab Emirates to build a new accommodation block, raising questions about the college’s links with authoritarian Gulf states accused of human rights abuses.

Critics say the Army is betraying the soldiers who gave their lives and that Bahrain and the UAE are trying to avert criticism of their regimes by buying silence with donations.

The 1914 Battle of Mons was the first major battle of the war. Against  overwhelming odds, the British Army inflicted 5,000 casualties on the Germans. At least 1,600 British troops were killed.

The Mons Hall is due to be reopened next month. King Hamad has been invited and a plaque will be unveiled with the inscription: ‘King Hamad Hall. This building, the former Mons Hall, was refurbished in 2013 with a generous gift from the Kingdom of Bahrain.’

Last night, MP Jeremy Corbyn said: ‘There’s something deeply ironic in renaming a hall that was in memory of soldiers who died in a tragic battle in the First World War in honour of a king who is routinely committing human rights abuses, including the shooting of demonstrators. I’m appalled.

'We should not be accepting money from such people. It’s simply wrong. They are in effect trying to buy our silence.’

And MP Andy Slaughter, Labour’s chairman of the Democracy In Bahrain all-party parliamentary group, said: ‘To change the name of something which commemorates a very tragic episode in British military history and an example of courage and heroism of British soldiers  simply because they’re getting a sum of money from a rather dubious source is appalling.

‘It reflects the appalling double standards the British Government and institutions have in relation to the Bahraini regime, which is guilty of all sorts of human rights abuses and fundamentally undemocratic.’

Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Bahrain last week on the second anniversary of the Gulf state’s pro-democracy uprising and on Thursday a 16-year-old boy was shot dead.

It is thought that more than 50 people have been killed since the uprising began.

The Mail on Sunday has learned that Sandhurst has also accepted a £15 million donation from the UAE, despite repeated criticism of the regime’s human rights record.

The money was used to build a new accommodation block for officers, named the Zayhed Building, after the first UAE president. The Crown Prince of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who was trained at Sandhurst, opened it in November.

Amnesty International says that about 90 political prisoners are currently detained in the UAE. A 2006 parliamentary report described the UAE as having a ‘serious democratic deficit’.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘All donations to Sandhurst are in compliance with the UK’s domestic and international legal obligations and our values as a nation.

‘Providing defence training and education to overseas cadets at the same high standards used by UK Armed Forces helps to save lives and raise awareness of human rights.’
