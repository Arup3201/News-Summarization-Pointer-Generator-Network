Sir Alex Ferguson has described golfer Rory McIlroy as the 'best in the world' after he led Europe to their third successive victory in the Ryder Cup.

World number one McIlroy was in imperious form as the hosts beat their American counterparts 16 ½ - 11 ½ at Gleneagles  in Scotland.

McIlroy collected three out of a possible five points for Europe at the weekend, with the highlight being his commanding performance against Rickie Fowler in Sunday's singles 5&4 victory.

‘Rory McIlroy delivered in a fashion that great players can do,' Ferguson, who delivered an inspirational speech to the European team ahead of the tournament, told Sky Sports News.

'That's why he's the best in the world. He won four out of the first five (holes) and it was cruise control after that.

‘The fans played a fantastic part because the players didn't want to let him down. It's creates an expectation that they want to live up to.’
