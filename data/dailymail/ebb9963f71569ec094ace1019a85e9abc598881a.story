Spain got its first taste of what the World Cup in Brazil has in store after nearly 1,000 people braved the cold to watch the reigning World and double European champions on Tuesday.

It is their first contact with the public since arriving at their training base at local club Atletico Paranaense on Sunday.

The crowd waited for hours to access the free session, with some onlookers climbing nearby rooftops to get a peek at one of the tournament favourites.

Among them the seemingly Chelsea-bound duo of Diego Costa and Cesc Fabrgeas, with Jose Mourinho confident he will capture the latter from Barcelona to replace Frank Lampard, as revealed by Sportsmail on Tuesday.

Mourinho is hoping a deal can be announced before Spain face Holland in their opening World Cup game on Friday.

Back at Spain's training base and Rodrigo Chiamulera, 27, who was accompanied by his 7-year-old nephew Eduardo, said: 'It's really something to be proud about, to have the World champions here training in our city, and especially at the club I support. I hope Brazil doesn't have to face them.'
