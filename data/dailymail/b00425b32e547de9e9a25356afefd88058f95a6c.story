A heartbroken family has paid tribute to a teenager who died after becoming the first young person in Britain ever diagnosed with a rare form of cancer.

Saffron Pedroche, 17, developed goblet cell carcinoma, an aggressive form of lymphatic cancer that normally only affects the elderly.

Doctors said they only knew of eight previous cases in the world where the killer disease had struck someone so young.

Heartbreak: Saffron Pedroche, 17, has died after becoming the first young person in Britain ever diagnosed with a rare form of cancer

Saffron and her boyfriend Dan. The teenager was told at the end of September she had just two weeks to live, but fought on until last month

Despite being told last September she only had two weeks to live, Saffron, a student, bravely held on and fought for four months after being given the terrible news.

She died last month with her mother and sister at her bedsideand over 300 people attended her funeral in her home city of Bristol.

Saffron had been a normal, healthy 
teenager until last August when she went to the doctors with a swollen leg 
after fluid started mysteriously collecting.

A series of tests came back with the 
devastating news that she was in advanced stages of the cancer which had
 spread from her stomach to the rest of her body,

At the end of September she was given just two weeks to live.

In the elderly, the cancer spreads 
slowly, and turns into an easily operable tumour, but because Saffron 
was so young, her body tried to fight the disease by creating a mass of 
fluid.

The painful fluid build-up actually gave the cancer chance to spread to her other organs which resulted in her death. 

Saffron's mother Donna Sidoli, 48, said: 'She was so strong and brave. When they told us she had incurable cancer I was really shocked and devastated, but Saff just seemed to know her fate.

'The doctors said she was the first young person in the Britain to get this cancer.

'It usually affects the elderly and doctors said they only knew eight other teenagers in the world that had got it and they were in America.

'They didn't know how to treat her - they did their best, but there was no real method for treating an old cancer in a young body.'

Ms Sidoli, a cleaner and artist, added that her daughter always had a smile on her face, right up until the end.

Worried: Saffron went to her GP after she developed a build-up of fluid in her leg in August. She was diagnosed with an aggressive form of lymphatic cancer that normally only afflicts the elderly

'Always smiling and happy': Saffron's  mother Donna, sister Jade and nephew Danny paid tribute to her

She said: 'She always cheered people up. In every photo she had a smile on her face and she even had a smile on her face when she died.

Goblet cells line the internal organs and make mucus.

The name refers to the fact they are shaped like miniature wine goblets when examined under a microscope.

Goblet cell carcinomas start in the appendix and are a type of neuroendocrine tumour (NET). They typically affect people over the age of 50.

The first symptom is appendicitis, or sometimes prolonged pain and an unusual lump in the lower right side of the abdomen.

Around 75 per cent of people diagnosed with a goblet cell tumor are alive five years after their diagnosis, highlighting how aggressive Saffron's case was.

An important predictor of survival is the initial  size of the tumour and whether or not cells have spread from its original location to other parts of the body.

'She was always looking out for others and was always happy.'

Saffron's sister Jade Hackwell, 25, added: 'She was one of life's natural beauties.

'She was so brave through all the messing and treatment. She really did have the right attitude.'

Saffron underwent two rounds of chemotherapy but her third course of radiotherapy had to be cancelled because a massive amount of fluid had built up in her body.

Her sister added: 'She was carrying so much fluid she looked like she was pregnant - it was so hard around her stomach and legs it felt like wood.

'Her skin was tight and she was quite clearly uncomfortable, but she never complained.

'They put a line into her stomach through her back and drained ten litres of fluid - and did the same from her lungs as well.'

Ms Sidoli added:
 'She was a dancer and used to do break dancing, liked DJing and used to
 do a lot of rapping. She was a very spiritual person.

'She had a boyfriend called Dan who stuck by her all the way through.

'Most 16-year-old boys you wouldn't trust to stick around through thick and thin, but Dan was brilliant.'

Saffron spent her final weeks at St 
Peter's Hospice in Brentry, Bristol,  before returning to her home in 
Clifton, where she died. 

Her mother added: 'She was a dancer and used to do break dancing, liked DJing and used to do a lot of rapping. She was a very spiritual person'

Goblet cell carcinoid, also known as crypt cell carcinoma, is a rare stomach tumour that ravages the lymphatic system of sufferers.

It is a very aggressive form of cancer and usually treated with surgery but because Saffron was so young, the cancer had not formed into a visible lump.

Ms Sidoli is now planning to set up a charity to help young cancer sufferers.

Saffron's father Juan Pedroche has applied for permission to have a memorial bench for Saffron on picturesque Brandon Hill, which overlooks Bristol.
