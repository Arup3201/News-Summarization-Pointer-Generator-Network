A team of Range Rover drivers has completed the first ever hybrid expedition across the 'Silk Trail' - covering a staggering 10,500 miles from England to India.

Land Rover wanted to come up with a gruelling way of testing out its new eco-friendly prototype, so set drivers the challenge of completing the epic trip from Solihull in the Midlands to Mumbai.

The trail saw the cars traversing 13 countries along the way, encountering miles of mud and gravel tracks on the route which was designed to connect Asia to Europe for trading over 2,000 years ago.

The new Range Rover Hybrid prototypes take on the 10,500-mile journey from England to India, travelling through 13 different countries along the way

The team of three Range Rover hybrids and four support cars travelled through 13 countries on the route which was designed to connect Asia to Europe for trading over 2,000 years ago

The team took 53 days to complete the journey which saw them encounter temperatures of up to 43C and dangerously high altitudes

Cattle grids, river passings and mountain-edge trails were some of the challenges drivers faced 
throughout the trip which took 53 days to complete.

The convoy of three Range Rovers and four support cars, drove through Europe before travelling through Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, China, Nepal and finally India.

For seven consecutive days, the team drove at altitudes between 11,000 and 17,648 feet - a location where air is reduced significantly - making it more difficult for humans and combustion engines.

But the Range Rover prototypes, which have a 3-litre diesel engine as well as an electric motor, battled through the difficult conditions and averaged around 37mpg.

The new hybrid powertrain features three driver-selectable modes and combines Land Rover¿s 3-litre SDV6 diesel engine with a 35kW electric motor

The hybrid coped well with mud and gravel trails thrown its way as well as other conditions which were deemed 'impassable' for other cars

In electric mode, the hybrid off-roader can travel at speeds of up to 30mph for one mile before the diesel engine kicks in

A total of 15 punctures were suffered 
en route while four wheels were damaged by deep potholes, and four 
windscreens cracked by stones thrown-up on loose surfaces.

The
hybrid powertrain features three driver-selectable modes and combines 
Land Rover’s 3-litre SDV6 diesel engine with a 35kW electric motor 
integrated with the 8-speed ZF automatic transmission.

Emissions
are slashed by 26 per cent and the hybrids are capable of around 44mpg,
with the hybrid system weighing less than 120kg.

In electric mode, the hybrid off-roader can travel at speeds of up to 30mph for one mile before the diesel engine kicks in.

The hybrid model, which will be on British roads next year, was unveiled in August as the car giant looks to increase sales which continue to impress.

Jaguar Land Rover announced last week it had its best ever September performance, selling 43,181 vehicles - up 17 per cent.

In 2012, Jaguar Land Rover sold 357,773 vehicles, up 30 per cent. Of that, Jaguar sold 53,847 vehicles and Land Rover sold 303,926 vehicles.

In the 12 months to 31 March 2013, Jaguar Land Rover generated profit before tax of #1.675 billion with revenues of #15.8 billion.

Peter Richings, JLR Hybrids and Electrification Director described the expedition as 'remarkable' as the prototypes took 'all conditions in their stride'

The epic journey took drivers from the Midlands, through Europe, Russia, China and India among other countries on its mammoth route

The team of Range Rover drivers are the first to complete a hybrid expedition across the 'Silk Trail' to Mumbai

Wet-city streets in China and jaw-dropping mountain-edge trails were some of the terrain drivers faced along the 10, 472-mile journey from England to India

Peter Richings, JLR Hybrids and Electrification Director, said: 'The world’s first diesel hybrid expedition along the Silk Trail pioneered an ambitious route across Europe and Asia that would have been impassable to most other types of vehicle - but no matter how hostile the conditions, the Range Rover Hybrid prototypes took it all in their stride.

'In developing the hybrid-powered Range Rover, our objective was to gain hybrid’s fuel economy and carbon emissions advantages without compromising the Range Rover’s go-anywhere capabilities, its cabin space or its refinement.

'The success of this remarkable expedition clearly demonstrates we have achieved that.'

Two adventurers today set a new world record by driving from London to Cape Town in just ten days.

Robert Belcher, 58, and Stephen Cooper, 53, made the 10,000-mile journey in a British-built Land Rover Discovery, setting off at 5am on October 4.

From London's Royal Automobile Club, they went through France, Italy, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia and Botswana.

Getting there: Mr Belcher and Mr Cooper did the journey in ten days, three hours and 16 minutes. Here, they are pictured crossing the border into Sudan from Egypt

Largely unmodified: The vehicle was driven almost 24 hours a day on the epic drive and suffered just one problem when the brake light came on after hitting a bump

The former rally drivers arrived at the Mount Nelson Hotel in the South African capital at 9.15am local time (8.15am BST) today.

Mr
Belcher, from Bix, Oxfordshire, and Mr Cooper, from Lewes, East Sussex,
did the journey in ten days, three hours and 16 minutes.

The
duo, driving a 2005 Discovery 3, powered by a 2.7 TDV6 diesel engine, 
smashed the record set earlier this year by more than ten hours.

As
they passed through Africa, they endured thunderstorms, tense border 
crossings, giant potholes and a dangerously low fuel tank.

The
largely-unmodified vehicle was driven almost 24 hours a day and 
suffered just one problem when the brake light came on after hitting a 
bump.

Their attempt was sponsored by Warranty Direct with the hope of raising money and awareness for the Farm Africa charity.

Mr
Belcher said: ‘What a journey. We're exhausted but absolutely elated to
have broken the record and to have done it so safely and smoothly - if 
you don't count the hundreds of miles of potholes through central Africa
that is.

‘Despite the 
complexities of crossing so many borders we had relatively easy passage 
through each country and the friendly faces along the way made it all so
worthwhile.

‘After seeing 
changing scenery like we have over the last ten days, and sometimes 
going hours without seeing another vehicle, I think we will both 
struggle returning to the morning commute.’

The
duo join a small group of automotive adventurers who have set new 
records for the London-Cape Town journey over the last eight decades.

The first attempt at the drive from London to Cape Town was undertaken 80 years ago in 1933 in a Morris Eight convertible driven by Britons Cameron Gilg and Walter Kay.

The pair took a whopping 158 days to navigate a 13,000-mile route, which started in Liverpool and included a treacherous Sahara crossing.

Subsequent attempts at setting new records have been achieved on the 30th, 50th and 80th anniversaries of that first run.

The former record for the journey was set earlier this year in February by Philip Young and Paul Brace in an 875cc Fiat Panda, driving from Cape Town to London. It took them ten days, 13 hours and 28 minutes.

Transported: Their attempt was sponsored by Warranty Direct. Their vehicle is pictured left on a ferry on Lake Nasser, crossing from Egypt to Sudan

Teamwork: They passed through France, Italy, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia and Botswana en route to South Africa
