Paul Scholes believes Raheem Sterling and Jack Wilshere should follow the lead of Juan Mata and play in next summer's European Under 21 Championship, should England qualify.

Gareth Southgate's Young Lions take on Croatia in the first leg of their play-off at Molineux on Friday night and head into the match in fine form having won nine of their 10 group games.

But former England and Manchester United midfielder Scholes writes in his Independent column that there needs to be a culture change if England are to succeed at Under 21 level.

'There are too many young players who, having made a senior debut, see a move to the Under 21s as a demotion,' Scholes argues.

'Calum Chambers is a prime example. He went from the Under 19s to the senior team. Then he was in the Under 21s squad this week until the injury to John Stones meant that he returned to the seniors.

'I have no reason to doubt that Chambers would have taken the Under 21s seriously. But if any player needs a reminder, they only have to look as far as Juan Mata. He was part of the Spain squad that won the World Cup in 2010 in South Africa and then went back to the Under-21s the following summer and won the European Championship.

Scholes says that Calum Chambers (above) should not consider an Under 21s call-up a demotion

'If it is good enough for Mata, why not English lads, too? Should Southgate’s team make it to the tournament, I would advocate taking Raheem Sterling and Jack Wilshere to the tournament next summer, even though they are well-established in the senior team.'

Scholes highlights the counter-argument to his point; namely that dropping players who had played in qualifiers for those who haven't would be inherently unfair.

But he retorts: 'Does the Football Association want to win something? If the answer is 'Yes', then it is time to be ruthless about getting the best team on the pitch.'
