Pictures which V. Stiviano claims are proof she was assaulted in New York City have been released on the same day a 40-year-old man was charged with attacking the 31-year-old who caused the downfall of LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling.

Provided exclusively to MailOnline by her attorney Mac Nehoray, the images allegedly show extensive bruising across the right side of the 31-year-old's face.

In one photograph, taken after Sunday's alleged assault outside the Gansevoort Hotel, a stunned looking Stiviano has what appears to be a huge florid mark burgeoning from her eye down to her chin.

In the other, which was presumably taken the day after, Stiviano's face seems to be painfully swollen, especially around her cheek.

Shocking: These two images - taken on Sunday night and the next day - reveal what appears to be serious bruising and swelling suffered by V.Stiviano in the alleged racially motivated assault she suffered over the weekend in Manhattan

Dominick Diorio, 40, of Old Bethpage, New York, was originally charged with third-degree assault as a hate crime, assault, harassment and aggravated harassment

The 40-year-old was arrested in connection with the incident involving V. Stiviano outside the Gansevoort Hotel, New York police said

Even though she is wearing make-up in one of the photographs, the effects of the alleged attack appear to be visible.

Nehoray said Stiviano had been examined by a doctor after the incident, but found to be 'banged up but OK.'

These
 images were released on the same day that Dominick Diorio, 40, was 
arrested at his home in Old Bethpage, New York, and charged with assault
 as a hate crime, aggravated harassment and harassment for punching 
Stiviano in the face outside the Gansevoort Hotel on Sunday.

He 
and another man allegedly hurled racist abuse during the attack, including the N-word, at 
Stiviano after she left a restaurant with friends at around 6.40pm. The 
second man has not been arrested.

They apparently recognized Stiviano from her role in the recent NBA race scandal, which caused Sterling to sell the Clippers after she recorded him making bigoted comments about black people.

New York Police Department Detective Brian Sessa told reporters that the investigation is still ongoing.

Diorio, who was in the city with his friend to celebrate his 40th birthday, allegedly became involved in an argument with Stiviano inside Revel restaurant, which is near to the Gansevoort.

According to Stiviano's legal team, she was struck by the two men while they screamed racist abuse as they left.

'Ms. V. Stiviano was attacked outside of Gansevoort Hotel by two white males,' a statement released by the law firm said.  

'As Ms. Stiviano was getting inside a cab, one of the assailants punched her in the face, calling her a f**** n**** b****.

'Moments later, Ms. Stiviano was punched again by the same person while he was yelling 'I am going to slaughter you'.

'As the assault on Ms. Stiviano continued, some by-standers attacked the assailant.

'Ms. Stiviano was rushed away from the scene and was seen by a private physician upon her return to the hotel.

'She is badly bruised and swollen on the right side of her face and has some difficulty with her speech.'

Reported: Stiviano spoke to detectives on Monday and told them the assault happened outside the Gansevoort Hotel in Manhattan's Meatpacking District on Sunday night

'Punched': Stiviano, who recorded the racist rant that was leaked and led to Sterling's ejection from professional basketball, was allegedly attacked

Diorio was reportedly injured by the passersby who jumped to Stiviano's aid and according to The New York Post was found by police sprawled on the floor, bleeding from a wound.

They took him to hospital to treat his injuries on Sunday night, unaware at the time he was the man who allegedly struck Stiviano.

NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton had said yesterday his officers had not received any reports of an alleged attack against Stiviano.

Because Stiviano and her lawyer Mac Nehoray had not filed a police report, officers had not been investigating the fight.

But on Monday Stiviano filed a complaint with the NYPD and on the same day Diorio turned himself into police.

He was identified in surveillance footage by police and then put in a lineup and picked out by Stiviano on Tuesday.

Diroio currently lives with his parents and his father told The New York Post of his shock.

'Wow, I'am not going to tell my wife about this. That'll just upset her. I don't know what to do.'

Stiviano's attorneys Alaleh Kamran and Mac Nehoray expressed their gratitude to the NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force on Tuesday evening and said that their client met with the Assistant District Attorney and answered additional questions.

 in New York to appear on Anderson Cooper's CNN show on Monday night

Recorded: Donald Sterling was recorded making racist remarks that resulted in an NBA ban in April and a fight over ownership of the Clippers

Earlier her attorneys said they are examining surveillance video of the alleged attack.

'We understand that there are now two videos of the assault that have been located,' her lawyer's office said in a statement.

'In addition, several witnesses have come forward with relevant and critical information regarding the facts surrounding the incident and the identity of the assailants.'

Stiviano recorded the racist rant that was leaked and led to Sterling's ejection from professional basketball.

He then handed control of team to his wife Shelly before a $2 billion deal to sell the franchise was agreed with former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.

It came just days before an NBA panel was due to meet to discuss revoking Sterling's ownership over the team in light of the racism scandal last month.

However the deal has yet to go through as it has to be approved by the NBA and Sterling is believed to be fighting it.

Sterling had bought the Clippers for $12.5 million in 1981.
