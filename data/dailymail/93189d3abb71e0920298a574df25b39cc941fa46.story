Missing: Durham School deputy headmaster Mark Bushnell has not been seen since yesterday morning

Fears were mounting today over the deputy head of a £25,000-a-year boarding school who went missing yesterday morning.

Police said they are 'growing increasingly concerned' for the safety of Mark Bushnell, 50, who has worked at 600-year-old Durham School for more than 20 years.

The school's headmaster today described Mr Bushnell as 'a highly respected colleague and friend' and urged members of the public to look out for him.

Mr Bushnell was last seen at 11.30am yesterday, when he drove away from his home in Durham.

Officers described the teacher as being around 5ft10, slim, with closely-shaved grey hair. He may have been wearing a checked shirt and brown or blue jeans.

His car, a grey Citroën C3, was found by police at a picnic site near the sea.

Officers tracked down the vehicle at Blackhall Rocks, Peterlee, around half an hour's drive from Durham.

Officers and search parties, including a police helicopter, were seen scouring the area today in the hope of finding signs of Mr Bushnell.

Teesdale Mountain Rescue were scrambled to the scene, the coastguard has been informed and a police helicopter could be seen hovering over the sea.

Today Martin George, the headmaster of Durham School, whose alumni include actor Alexander Armstrong and British Lions player Geoff Parling, spoke of the school's 'deep concern' over Mr Bushnell's disappearance.

He said: 'Mark is a highly respected colleague and friend at Durham School, as deputy head he constantly works for the benefit of pupils.

'The whole school community is deeply concerned for his welfare and would urge him to contact his family as a matter of urgency.

'We would also ask any members of the public who may have seen Mark to contact police immediately.'

Prestigious: Mr Bushnell teaches the prestigious Durham School, which has fees of as much as £25,000 a year

Chief Inspector Andy Huddleston of Durham Constabulary said: 'We are growing increasingly concerned for Mr Bushnell and need to trace him as soon as possible.

'Mr Bushnell is deputy head of Durham School and a well-respected member of staff.

'Anyone who may know of his whereabouts is asked to contact police as soon as possible.'

Mr Bushnell worked for the Bank of England for a year after graduating before retraining as an economics teacher. He has worked at Durham school, a co-educational day and boarding school, since 1993 and was made deputy headmaster in 2012.

Anyone with information on Mr Bushnell’s whereabouts or anyone who may have seen him is asked to contact police on 101.
