A quickly draining battery can be a pain for many iPhone users.

But it turns out one of the most popular apps might be to blame.

A former Apple Store Genius has unearthed evidence that the Facebook app is eating away at your phone’s juice.

Is Facebook draining your battery? A former Apple Store employee has discovered that the popular third-party app runs processes in the battery that can decrease your phone's juice

According to Scotty Loveless from Overthought.org: 'I just got the iPhone 5s about two weeks ago, and thought my battery was draining a little too quickly.

‘Being the nerd that I am, I decided to run the app Instruments from Xcode, Apple’s developer tool, in order to see what the problem was.

‘During this testing, Facebook kept jumping up on the process list even thought I wasn’t using it.

‘So I tried disabling Location Services and Background App Refresh for Facbook.'

Doing this, Loveless noticed that his battery percentage increased from 12% to 17%.

Disable Background App Refresh for apps other than Facebook.

Turn off push email.

Stop push notifications from apps you don't use frequently.

Turn on airplane mode when you haven't got a signal anyway.

Stop closing apps, as your phone uses more battery each time it opens them again.

‘I have confirmed this behaviour on multiple iPhones with the same result,’ continues Loveless.

‘Bad, Facebook, bad.’

Fortunately, as Loveless points out, there is an easy fix.

Navigating to Settings > Privacy > Location Services will enable you to turn off Location Services for Facebook.

Then go to Settings > General > Background App Refresh to turn that functionality off for Facebook.

One of the reasons for this might be that Facebook is introducing more features as it bids to become your number one communications service.

This isn’t the first time Facebook has been caught causing phone users trouble, though

Previously in January MailOnline reported that the app was reading your texts, which the company claims is required for security reasons.

You can turn off Location Services for Facebook within the iOS Settings menu to save battery life

Heading into your settings will also allow you to turn off 'Background App Refresh' for Facebook, saving more battery life but at the expense of not getting constant updates
