Burj Khalifa occupies a floor area of 3,331,100 square feet.

It takes in Dubai’s many landmarks, 
including the iconic Burj Al Arab hotel, the world’s biggest mall, the 
Dubai Mall and the Meydan Racecourse and shows the remarkable growth of a
city still on a fast track to developing as a business hub and tourist 
destination.

'This is the first time we’ve 
captured a skyscraper on Street View—making Google Maps even more 
comprehensive,' Google explained.

'The imagery was collected over three 
days using the Street View Trekker and Trolley, capturing 
high-resolution 360-degree panoramic imagery of several indoor and 
outdoor locations of the building.'

Speedy: The building¿s elevators, reach the 160th floor at speeds of some 10 metres per second. It has the most stories and highest occupied floor of any building in the world, and ranks as the world's tallest structure

Higher and higher: Construction of the $1.5billion tower began in 2004, with its official opening in January 2010. Initially called the Burj Dubai, its name was changed to honour Abu Dhabi leader Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahayan after he bailed out indebted Dubai to the tune of $10billion

Packed in: It boasts the world's first Armani hotel on the bottom floors, houses 900 Dubai residences, 37 floors of office space, a fine dining restaurant and an observation deck

'In addition to the breathtaking views
from the world’s tallest observation deck on the 124th floor, you can 
also see what it feels like to hang off one of the building’s 
maintenance units on the 80th floor, normally used for cleaning 
windows!'

The Trekker was created a year ago by Google explained  Pascal Malite, Street View programme manager.

'It allows you to go to all the places you want to go where no other device will.'

Pascal used the window cleaning apparatus to capture the stunning images.

'It was amazing to be able to stand outside the building and see the beautiful Dubai,' she said.

Interior: A device called the 'Trolley' was used to capture the interior images
