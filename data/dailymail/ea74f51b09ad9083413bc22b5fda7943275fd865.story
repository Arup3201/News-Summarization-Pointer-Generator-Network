The world's oldest Ford motor car is expected to fetch more than £300,000 when it comes up for auction next month.

Not only is it 109 years old, but the vehicle - known as Chassis 30 - can also be credited with having saved the fledgling firm from bankruptcy.

The 'Model A' was Ford's first design, and Chassis 30 was the third of 1,750 units rolled out between 1903 and 1904. With its two predecessors consigned to the scrapheap, the vehicle takes the title of the oldest surviving Ford.

Unique opportunity: The oldest surviving Ford 'Model A' was the third car ever to be built by the company

Preserved: The vintage vehicle stayed in the same family for nearly fifty years, and has been lovingly preserved by every one of its owners. It is expected to fetch upwards of £300,000 when it comes to auction in October

The US giant has since sold more than 350 million cars around the world, and is more popular in the UK than any other manufacturer.

But if it wasn’t for this particular vehicle, then the company might have gone bust before it had even got off the ground.

In July 1903 the newly-established Ford Motor Company was in dire straits with cash reserves of just $223.65.

Deposits received on Chassis 30 and two other Model As helped see it through to the end of the month.

With a 1668cc, two-cylinder engine, the four-seat Model A put out a mere 8bhp to give it a top speed of 28mph.

Chassis 30 was bought new in 1903 by butter maker Herbert L McNary, and stayed within the same family until 1950.

Advanced for its time: The Model A's 8bhp engine could propel it to a top speed of 28mph

Despite its age it has had just five owners in 109-years and underwent a full restoration in 2007.

The antique automobile will go under the hammer at RM Auctions’ Hershey sale in Pennsylvania, USA on October 11.

It is being offered with an estimate of between $300,000 and $500,000 (£186,000 - £310,000).

Lifeline: The deposit on Chassis 30 saved the 
fledgling Ford Motor Company from bankruptcy and ensured Detroit would 
become a centre of automobile manufacturing

A statement from RM Auctions, which is handling the sale, said: 'It is impossible to overstate the importance of chassis number 30.

'It is accompanied by extensive documentation, detailing its extraordinary history, and its condition is exemplary.

'No automobile manufacturer has had anywhere close to the impact of the Ford Motor Company.

Setting a precedent: Ford would go on to sell over 350 million vehicles worldwide since 1903

'Without Herbert L. McNary’s $170 cheque, modern day motorists might be driving Popes or Flanders or Maxwells, and might speak of Hartford or Tarrytown in the same way they speak of Detroit.

'Chassis number 30 is one of three Fords sold on the first day the Ford Motor Companyrecorded orders.

'It is the only survivor of the three, has had only five owners in the nearly 110 years since it was built, has been carefully maintained and restored, and its history and provenance are impeccable.'
