A six-day-old boy who was wounded by a hunter's stray bullet is expected to survive but will be blind.

Mother Stefanie Iverson said that her son Shayne's life was spared when the bullet exited through the orbital area - or eye socket - of his skull rather than hitting his brain during the tragic accident in Pennsylvania.

The boy's father, Jeremie, was holding the baby on September 25 when the bullet came through a window of the family's home near Saltsburg, about 35 miles east of Pittsburgh, and struck the baby's skull.

Shayne Iverson was hit by a hunter's stray bullet when he was just six days old and in his father's arms at his home in Pennsylvania. He survived but has been left blind

The Iverson family have set up a GoFundMe page where they released a picture of baby Shayne with his big brother Caden, nine, and two-year-old sister Gabi when he was a day old

Indiana County District Attorney Pat Dougherty said the hunter had an agricultural deer control permit when he fired the shot that wounded the boy about 7pm that day. 

The shooting was likely accidental, but questions remain about whether the hunter followed state regulations.

The Iversons have two older children, nine-year-old son Caden and Gabi, aged two. 

On a GoFundMe page set up by his aunt Kayln Ivey, she wrote: 'He's been such a strong little fighter, fighting for his new life he had just begun, in the ICU sedated. 

'This fundraiser is to help with all the medical expenses as the family fight through this tragedy.'

Almost $6,000 dollars has already been donated by well-wishers towards the baby's medical costs. 

The family are consulting with multiple surgeons while they wait for Shayne's brain swelling to go down.

The boy's father met with the state police and game commissioner on Tuesday, he wrote on Facebook, adding that his wife refused to leave Shayne's side in the ICU. 

According to TribLive, it won't be decided if the hunter will face any charges until forensics are completed in several weeks. 

The hunter was 300 yards from the home and using a .308 hunting rifle on private farm opposite the Iversons' home, the news site reported.
