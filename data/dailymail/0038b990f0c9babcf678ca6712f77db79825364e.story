Six rugby players have drowned after being swept out to sea by freak currents in South Africa.

One body has been found and five others are presumed drowned after players from Motherwell Rugby Club were caught up in strong rip tides on Port Elizabeth's Bluewater Bay beach on Sunday.

Officials said the players had gone for a swim in the water to cool off after a training session when powerful currents took hold.

Sea rescuers said the rugby stars were among a group of 21 bathers caught up in the strong currents at midday on Sunday.

National Sea Rescue Institute station commander Ian Gray said although 15 people were rescued after the tragedy, one has been confirmed dead and five are missing presumed drowned.

Mr Gray said rescuers launched an extensive search for the missing rugby players but were forced to suspend the hunt at dusk.

Mr Gray added: 'An extensive search by three NSRI sea rescue craft, a rescue rubber-duck and rescue jet-ski and the emergency services helicopter has revealed no sign of the five missing men.

'All are believed to be aged in their early 20's and all five missing are believed to be members of the Motherwell Rugby Club.

'An SA Air Force 15 Squadron Charlie Flight helicopter, carrying two Port Elizabeth NSRI rescue swimmers, has joined since first light in an ongoing search operation.'

Some of the rescue team today described a scene of 'hell' as the swimmers were swept into the open water.

Lifesaver Brendon Helm told South Africa's News24 website he felt helpless as he and eight colleagues realised they would be unable to save everyone.

He said: 'It is something I will always remember.

'Only eight of us and 21 desperate people with wide open eyes begging to come out.

'Some of us took out two or three at a time and almost got into trouble ourselves.'

The Motherwell Rugby Club today confirmed six of its players had died and said the men's families were still being informed.

The team's manager Mcdisi Mazamba told how he had taken his players for their weekly training session at Port Elizabeth's Bluewater Bay beach, which lies on the Indian Ocean and is famous for its clean sand and safe swimming.

The shaken coach said the athletes were enjoying a swim when strong currents dragged them out to sea.

He added: 'Everything was peaceful, the sea was calm and they were up to their chests in the water.

'The next moment we just saw arms and hands in the air as the current swept them away.'

Tragedy: Motherwell Rugby Club confirmed the news about their players on its Facebook page today

Rescuers said yesterday's tragedy happened after the rugby players became sucked up in a freak dangerous rip tide.

The athletes, who were training for a national competition next month, were dragged away from the shore alongside several other swimmers.

The 15 people who were pulled alive from the waves were treated on the beach for shock and near-drowning symptoms.

Police confirmed an inquest had been opened into the tragedy and said the dead man's body had been sent for forensic examination by pathologists.

The South African Rugby Union today described the incident as a 'devastating tragedy'.

The organisation's president Oregan Hoskins said: 'These young men were preparing to compete in a Saru Easter Tournament in Cape Town in a fortnight and were enjoying a carefree day on the beach with their team-mates.

'To have their afternoon turned into a day of tragedy is shocking for the whole rugby community and our thoughts and prayers go out to their families.'
