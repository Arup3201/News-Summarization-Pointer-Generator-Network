Most of her Made In Chelsea co-stars have turned their hand to designing fashion ranges and it seems that Fran Newman-Young was keen to jump on the bandwagon, too.

The reality TV star, who lives with Binky Felstead, has unveiled and modelled her debut range for Daisystreet.co.uk and says it's a dream come true.

Speaking to MailOnline about the launch as she gives us an exclusive sneak peek of her designs, the 26-year-old said: 'I am immensely excited. I've always dreamed of having my own fashion line. 

'Back at school, my books were covered in doodles of outfits and I've made dozens of scrapbooks filled with magazine cuttings. That’s why creating this range has been such an amazing experience; I've learnt so much from their team.'

From party dresses to daytime attire, Fran promises that there's something for everyone in the collection and says each piece, which is no more than £50, is 'really affordable'. 

When it came to garnering inspiration for the range, the English graduate, who describes her personal style as 'Bohemian Grunge', looked to music icons.

She said: 'A lot of my inspiration comes from Debbie Harry and Gwen Stefani - especially from her earlier years of No Doubt. There are also hints of Stevie Nicks' boho chic in there.

'I love vintage, throwback type pieces but with a bit of an edge. I think that’s really reflected in the collection. In particular with the fedoras, faux fur gilets and relaxed knits.'

Citing Kate Moss as her ultimate style crush, Fran was extremely complimentary about her co-stars' wardrobe choices. 

'Everyone on Made In Chelsea has their own unique style, but I would love to raid Rosie's wardrobe. I've always admired Oliver Proudlock's style too,' she said.

She would love to give Simon Cowell a makeover. 'He's a smart, powerful man who's overshadowed by jokes about his waistband,' she laughed.

While Fran has fashion covered, her younger sister Olivia, who recently left the E4 show, is a talented make-up artist. 

Speaking about her sister's work, she said: 'Olivia is the best makeup artist I know. She gives me loads of tips. Her YouTube tutorials are really useful too, especially the one on how to create the perfect liquid liner flick. 

'She knows how I like my skin dewy and fresh with minimal coverage. Unfortunately, she doesn't do my makeup as much as I would like her too.'

Boho babe: Fran has given FEMAIL an exclusive sneak peek of the new range and she hopes it will provide some Christmas party wardrobe inspiration 

Big plans: Fran says she would love to continue with her own fashion line with the e-tailer and says her head is already filled with ideas for SS15 

The pair are extremely close and are even working together on a Christmas cooking series for The Tasty Tenner called Cocktails and Canapes. 

So passionate is she about cooking that Fran has got her sights set on her own show.

Speaking about her ambitions, she said: 'I would love to have my own cooking show which teaches young people how to cook delicious, healthy meals within a budget. Healthy food is so expensive and there are so many conflicting nutritional guides. 

'I would also love to continue with my own fashion line with Daisystreet.co.uk - my head is already filled with ideas for SS15! I’d love to create more accessories too. I'm an accessories junky.' 

Despite rumours that she and Cheska Hull  threatened to quit Made In Chelsea after being sent home from New York City in the middle of filming the reality show's spin-off series, Fran confirmed to MailOnline that she is still filming with the show. 

Set for success: Fran has showcased her bubbly personality on the E4 show and looks set for a bright future
