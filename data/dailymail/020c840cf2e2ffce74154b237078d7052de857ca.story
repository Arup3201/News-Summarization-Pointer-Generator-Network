University dropout: James Middleton insisted he has been successful because of his hard graft

He lives in a million-pound flat bought for him by his parents and works in the family business, while his brother-in-law happens to be second in line to the throne.

But James Middleton, who's big sister is the Duchess of Cambridge, has insisted that his business success is down to his own efforts and that 'nothing is handed to anyone on a plate'.

The 24-year-old, who is the younger brother of the Duchess of Cambridge, said hard-graft, not Royal connections, is the secret behind his achievements.

Mr Middleton, who was educated at the £30,000-per-year Marlborough College, has launched four companies after dropping out of Edinburgh University just a year into his four-year course.

They are all linked to his parents' successful Party Pieces company and are registered to the same Berkshire address.

But he insisted he has not done well because of his parents wealth or his sister marrying Prince William.

His first business was the Cake Kit Company - and after it began making a profit he launched three more companies which are Nice Cakes, Nice Wine and Nice Group London.

Mr Middleton, who lives in a £1million Chelsea flat - bought by his parents - with his sister Pippa, commutes daily to Bucklebury, Berkshire, along the M4 in his Range Rover to where the family business is based.

He said: 'I've won awards for my own efforts because I am young and good in my 
own right.

'It's not just because of my family that I've been getting 
attention. I want to be known for my own contribution, not for being a "relative of" - that's boring,'  he told the Sunday Times News Review.

The Middleton family have been accused of cashing in on their royal connections - and were plugging a range of street party products on their website before Kate's wedding.

Now they are selling a range of party kits for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.

James Middleton is dyslexic and as a result had to memorise the reading he gave at his sister's wedding a year ago.

Despite his family's business success - and the £500,000 that the Middletons spent on school fees for their three children - James said there is no reason why others cannot launch their own comapnies like him.

He added: 'Nothing is handed to anyone on a plate. There are possibilities for 
everyone; there's no one who can't do something. You can start up a 
business on next to nothing.'

A week ago he took part in a cross country ski event in Sweden with his sister Pippa.

Mr Middleton says he has turned down thousands of interview requests since Kate's wedding to Prince William last April.

But breaking his silence, James admitted he was 'lucky' to be able to turn to his parents Michael and Carole for advice as he started up his own enterprises.

He spends three-hours commuting each day and has revealed in previous interviews how he often works for 14 hours a day.

His Cake Kit Company was formed after he spent months experimenting with ingredients for home-made cake sets.

He said cakes were the 'focal point' of any celebration - even during a recession.

The business idea formed as he flew back from Edinburgh University in 2007. He quit his four-year environmental resources management course after just a year.

The kits have various themes for childrens' birthdays - including football, rockets, fairies and handbags.

All the kits contain the ingredients, candles and a throwaway baking tray.

James has written on his website: 'I believe baking may be the most alluring kitchen activity for children.

'I have great childhood memories of my mother baking and I was always a willing participant, especially if it meant I could re-varnish the kitchen floor with treacle!'
