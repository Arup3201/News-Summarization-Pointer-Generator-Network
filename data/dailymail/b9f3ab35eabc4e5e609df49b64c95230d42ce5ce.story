A 'sovereign citizen' who claimed an Ohio family's home while they visited a dying relative has filed deeds for another 11 properties.

Ohio's Robert Carr applied for the 'quiet titles' after claiming the owners gave up their ownership rights when they left the property.

'When you abandon a property, bam, walk 
away from it, ‘I ain’t never coming back. I don’t want nothing to do 
with it’ right? Somebody can come in, ‘Oh mine',' he told WLWT.

'Sovereign citizen'; Robert Carr filed 'quiet titles' on 12 'abandoned' properties

Under new owners: This is just one of the $130,000 homes that Robert Carr has possessed under his 'sovereign' rights and used a 'quiet title'

As a member of the sovereign citizens movement, Carr believes he can handpick which laws to follow.

The movement is premised on the idea that current local, state, and federal governments are 'illegal' and have veered away from the founding fathers’ original intent.

In relation to property, Carr claims home owners forfeit their ownership rights when they leave a property, even for a weekend.

He doesn't expect to pay anything for the homes. 

A Springdale, Ohio family is currently challenging Carr's deed on their home, which they had owned for 21 years. 

The unidentified family say they were locked out of their own home after visiting relatives out-of-town.

Carr showed them a document he filed with the County Court.

'What he's looking for is full title and ownership of the home,' the family's attorney, Alison Warner, said.

'He's in their home. They don't know when he's there. He can be there now.'

The family say they feel violated.

'I'm very scared, you 
know, because I never know if somebody's going to be here,' the 
homeowner said.

WLWT uncovered 11 other instances where Carr filed the same paperwork. Seven of the cases were filed on the same day.

'I have a team of people who go out and I say make sure the house is empty. If it's empty, change the locks,' Carr said. 'Anybody can do it.'

locks and emptied the house

 the area

Carr has been charged with breaking and entering in one case of disputed ownership, but he is fighting that charge.

Quiet title actions are used to determine who legally holds the title to property, because real estate may sometimes change hands frequently, and the lawsuits can help remove clouds over claims of ownership.

The anti-government 'sovereign citizens' movement has grown in recent years and is rooted in the anti-Semitic, anti-black and anti-tax Posse Comitatus movement of the 1970s and 1980s.

Most recent recruits to the sovereign citizens movement found themselves in desperate situations, often due to the economy or foreclosure, and are drawn to the idea of easy money or living free of legal consequences.

Sovereign citizens are becoming well-known by the courts for filing astronomical liens against banks, attorneys and government employees.

While these are usually unsuccessful, they can be expensive to fight and take a long time to resolve.

The FBI has been informed about the case but won't comment on the specifics.
