Adrian Lewis began his quest for a third world title with a comfortable win over David Pallett in just 23 minutes Alexandra Palace on Tuesday.

The 2011 and 2012 champion brushed his opponent aside in three sets and recorded a three-dart average of 101.9, the highest of the tournament so far.

Lewis hit four 180s and only dropped three legs on Tuesday night in a statement that he means business in north London this year.

Jackpot was far too strong for his opponent David Pallett in their first-round match at Alexandra Palace

He said: 'I wanted to send out a warning shot to the rest of the field tonight and I think I did that.

'After that first set when I come off the stage and saw I was on 126 average I fancied having a go at the record, but I missed a few doubles in the second set and it slipped away.

'No tournament really gives me a buzz like this one does, I've put a lot of work in over the last few weeks and I'll be practising more over Christmas as well because this is the one I want to win.'

Tuesday was the final day of first-round action at Ally Pally before the three-day Christmas break, and there was another upset as German teenager Max Hopp beat Mervyn King.

King, a former semi-finalist at the World Darts Championship, appeared to be struggling with a bad back as he crashed out of the tournament.

Hopp prevailed in a final set tie-break, and he admitted: 'I didn't expect to win the match.'

The German continued: 'He's a brilliant player in the tournament but I just had a little feeling that I could do well. And when I had that 161 I just had a feeling it was going to go in, so I thought just go for it and when I did it was just amazing, I don't really have words for it.

'I can't wait to go and enjoy this now with my family, then we'll fly home to Germany and I can enjoy Christmas with them before coming back to the second round.'
