Luke Shaw has completed a £31.5million switch to Manchester United and has signed a four-year deal at Old Trafford.

The England defender successfully completed a routine medical at United's Carrington training complex and has been informed he will be manager Louis van Gaal's first-choice left-back.

It is understood that he has been 
assured that he will start and 
33-year-old Patrice Evra, who will remain with United, is expected to 
have a reduced role at the club.

The former Southampton starlet has signed a four-year contract with an option to extend for a further year and revealed his delight at joining the 13-time Premier League champions.

The Saints will receive £27million up front rising to the full figure.

He said: 'I am thrilled and excited to be joining Manchester United. I have been at Southampton since I was eight years old and I would like to thank them and the fans for everything they have done for me.

'I want to continue to progress my career and joining United is the ideal place for me to do that.

'I am looking forward to this new chapter in my life and also looking forward to learning from the world-class players and management at the club.'

With Van Gaal taking charge of Holland's World Cup campaign, his No 2 club legend Ryan Giggs earmarked the new signing for success at United.

'Luke is a very talented young left-back with great potential. He has developed immensely during his time at Southampton and has all the attributes to become a top player,' said Giggs.

'I am delighted he has joined 
Manchester United as I believe this is the right club for him to 
continue his development as a young player and eventually fulfil that 
promise.'  

Shaw's former club Southampton insisted they will use the money from the transfer to rebuild their squad.

Executive director Les Reed said: 'While we are sad to see Luke depart the club, we fought to ensure that we got the right deal for a player in whom we have invested a great deal of work over the past decade.

'Luke joined us at the age of eight, and our academy staff and coaches have helped him to progress into a top-class player. He will leave our club and carry forward our top-class pedigree, as others have done before.

'This deal is a good one for Southampton Football Club, and hopefully sends a clear message to other clubs wishing to bid for our players.

Green light: Louis van Gaal has given his blessing for the deal to go ahead to bring in Luke Shaw

'Luke’s transfer fee will be 
reinvested into the team as our new manager, Ronald Koeman, builds for 
the new season and for years to come.'

Sportsmail revealed on Thursday
 that the England international met United officials at the club's 
training ground, where he was given a personal tour ahead of his medical
 on Friday morning.

He will then head
 away on holiday before returning to meet his new team-mates for 
pre-season.

Sportsmail understands that his holiday plans have been 
scheduled to ensure that he is back in time for United’s pre-season of 
the United States in July.

Shaw
 is understood to have informed Southampton of his desire to leave the 
club at the end of May and a wage package in excess of £100,000 has been
 agreed in principle between United and the player for some time.

Former Old Trafford boss David Moyes did some of the groundwork in persuading Shaw to make the move, as United overcame interest from Chelsea to secure their man with a salary that blew the London club out of the water.

It is understood that new boss Van 
Gaal has given his blessing for the deal to go ahead. The Dutchman has 
been in regular contact with executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and he 
is understood to be delighted with the progress the club have made in 
the transfer market.

United cooled their interest in recent weeks to ensure that Shaw was fully focused on his involvement at the World Cup but as Sportsmail revealed on Monday morning, Ed Woodward intended to accelerate the pursuit once England returned from Brazil on Wednesday afternoon.

Shaw disembarked at Luton airport to see his family before heading up to the North-West to become Van Gaal's second signing, after Ander Herrera completed his transfer to the club on Thursday.

Sportsmail also understands that assistant
 manager Ryan Giggs has returned from St Georges Park to welcome Shaw, 
where he was undergoing his practical assessment for the Pro License 
coaching course on Thursday afternoon.

In the absence of Van Gaal and Giggs, Sir Bobby Charlton greeted Herrera at Carrington.

The fee for Shaw is somewhat higher than United may have initially hoped for, with Southampton's resistance increasing following Shaw's involvement in the World Cup and the arrival of Dutch manager Ronald Koeman, who has sanctioned the sale.

United were initially confident of securing a £27.5m swoop but Southampton have managed to push the overall fee beyond the £30m mark.

Shaw becomes the most expensive teenager in world football and he is the second most expensive signing in United's history, behind January recruit Juan Mata, who arrived for a £37m fee from Chelsea.

Shaw and Herrera are yet to be allocated squad numbers by United and it is believed that the club are waiting to offload a few players before allowing the two new signings to choose.
