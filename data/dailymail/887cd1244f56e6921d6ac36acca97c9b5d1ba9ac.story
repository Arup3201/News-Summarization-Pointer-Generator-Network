A police officer involved in a 12-hour armed siege only realised he had been shot when he discovered the 'bullet' in his mouth.

Lincolnshire Police said the officer was 'very lucky' and said it was 'quite amazing' that he survived the incident after disabled man Barry Horspool, 61, opened fire.

The officer, who has not been named, only discovered that the ammunition was there as he was being examined in hospital.

Siege: Armed police are involved in a stand-off with Barry Horspool in Sutton St James, Lincolnshire, after he opened fire on an officer

Police are still carrying out tests to work out what weapon was fired at the officer - although a spokesman said it was believed to be a 'bullet' and not an airgun or shotgun pellet.

After the stand-off, Horspool was found dead upstairs in the property in Sutton St James, Lincolnshire, last Tuesday.

The married former farm labourer, who
is believed to have a grown-up daughter, is believed to have had his 
gun licence under review.

He may have reacted angrily after officers tried to seize his weapons.

The pensioner, who carried an oxygen canister and used a mobility scooter.

He was known to have a number of guns, which he used for shooting game – usually pigeons and partridges.

Officers clad in black balaclavas had 
video cameras and lights trained on the house as negotiators tried to 
contact Horspool through a loudspeaker.

Nearby families were warned to stay in their homes until the danger was cleared.

Police attempted to negotiate with the grandfather but stormed the property after the stand-off and found him dead.

The cause of death has not yet been confirmed and police are still trying to piece together what caused the incident.

Scene: The siege took place in the Chapelgate area of Lincolnshire village Sutton St James

A Lincolnshire Police spokesman said: 'Initially it was assumed that the officer’s injuries were caused by a fragment of glass from the car window.

'It was not until the officer got to hospital that a bullet was found lodged in his mouth.

'It’s quite amazing that he has walked away from this. He is clearly very luckily.

'The bullet has been sent off to ballistics specialists and is being forensically analysed to see if it is linked to a particular weapon.

'Investigations are otherwise ongoing.'

It was unclear where his wife Barbara
was during the stand-off. But Lincolnshire Police confirmed 'no 
hostages' were involved in the siege.

on a police car - and hit an officer in the mouth. Remarkably he escaped with minor injuries
