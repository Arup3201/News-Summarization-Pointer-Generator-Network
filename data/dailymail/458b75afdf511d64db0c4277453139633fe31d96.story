Dinamo Bucharest midfielder Stefan Barboianu played in his side's derby against bitter rivals Steaua despite losing his son just hours before. 

The 26-year-old Dinamo vice-captain was informed on Friday that his three-day old infant son, who was born more than three months premature, had died in hospital following complications.

Barboianu, capped 18 times by the Romanian under-21 team, told Dinamo coach Flavius Stoican prior to the 157th Eternal Derby that he was prepared to play despite his personal tragedy.

Stoican said it was an inappropriate time to discuss Barboianu's situation.

'I don't want to comment on Barboianu's family, it's not easy,' Stoican told reporters. 'I have great confidence in him.'

Romanian media outlets were full of praise for the courageous Barboianu. 

'A true professional and a character,' wrote digisport.ro with fans using internet forums and social media to offer their condolences. 

On the field, goals from Lukasz Szukala, Paul Papp and Claudiu Keseru gave the 1986 European Cup winners Steaua a well-deserved 3-0 win in a cracking atmosphere at the National Arena.

Steaua are top of the league on 31 points from 13 matches, five points ahead of CFR Cluj, who play Brasov on Monday. Dinamo are fifth on 22.
