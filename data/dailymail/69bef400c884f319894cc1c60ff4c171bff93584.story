A group of Oxford University students are on their way to stardom after their a cappella cover of a Shakira hit went viral - when it was tweeted by the pop star herself.

The choir - called Out Of The Blue - has racked up nearly 700,000 views after their debut music video for Hips Don’t Lie was posted on YouTube.

The short clip features 15 students wearing suits and shaking their hips to the tune in the historic grounds of the university.

Hips Don't Lie: Oxford University students perform Shakira's hit with choir Out of the Blue

They have now gone viral after Shakira heard about the video and tweeted a link to her 26 million followers and a message to the boys.

She wrote: ‘Hey @ootboxford, we LOVE you’re a capella Shak medly!’

Club president Josh Barr, 20, who studies English Literature, said: ‘We thought it was a really iconic and classic song.

‘For our first charity single, we wanted to pick a song that everybody recognises, but would also be fun.

Hands in the air: Oxford University students perform Shakira's hit to raise money for charity

The Oxford University choir's single was re-tweeted by Shakira to her 26 million followers

Pop star Shakira said that she loved the students' a capella cover of her hit video Hips Don't Lie

‘You can see from the video just how much fun we had making it, and I think that’s important too.

‘We try to appeal to as many people as possible. Shakira is such a global artist people have been watching our video from all over the world.

‘We can’t believe the overwhelmingly positive response we’ve had to it.’

The society is raising money for Helen & Douglas House, a children’s hospice in Oxford.

Mr Barr, who has been singing with the group for two years, said: ‘The work they do there is so uplifting to families in times of crises, that we want to help them out whichever way we can.

‘We love singing so we thought it would be a good idea to release a charity single, with all proceeds going to them.’

Their video has had nearly 700,000 hits on YouTube after Shakira tweeted it to her millions of followers

Main tenor Ollie Nicholls, 20, who also studies English Literature, performs one of the solos in the song.

He told student newspaper The Tab: ‘We chose to do a Shakira mash-up because it was the first song that we learned together as a group and it’s quite special to us.

‘It is also one of our most upbeat numbers so we thought it would be more fun to make the video.

‘It is quite unpredictable to have all the boys dressed up in suits, shaking our hips and dancing to Shakira.

‘We were going for the unexpected vibe.’

The boys still have a long way to go before they match their idol, however, as Shakira’s original video has been viewed more than 181 million times.
