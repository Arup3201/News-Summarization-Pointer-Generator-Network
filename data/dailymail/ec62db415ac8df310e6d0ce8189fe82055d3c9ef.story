Leonardo DiCaprio's niece who was 'abducted' by her criminal parents is now in the care of her grandfather, the actor's father George DiCaprio, after being found in Texas last Thursday.

Six-year-old Normandie Farrar is the daughter of DiCaprio's older step-brother Adam Farrar, 43, who was arrested on January 24 in Collin County, Texas on drug charges. Farrar's girlfriend Charity Moore, 38, was arrested just a week before on similar charges.

Because of their criminal histories, daughter Normandie was a dependent of the court in California and should not have been taken outside the state by her parents when they moved to Texas this summer.

Following his arrest, the Los Angeles Police Department accused Farrar of 'concealing' Normandie out of state.

 his home in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, according to X17online.com.

DiCaprio, currently up for an Academy Award for his role in the Wolf of Wall Street, grew up with Farrar after his dad married Farrar's mother Peggy when he was young.Dicaprio's mother Iremlin DiCpario divorced George when her son was still a baby.

DiCaprio and Farrar used to be close and 
the pair were seen attending Los Angeles Lakers games together and hitting 
the Hollywood party scene – although in recent years it’s thought their 
relationship has turned sour. 

Sources told RadarOnline that Farrar 
and his Oscar nominee step-brother 'have had zero contact in recent 
years and do not get along.'

It
 is widely reported that DiCaprio was inspired to go into acting after 
he saw his step-brother carve a career for himself in commercials, 
movies and TV in the 1980s.

Farrar is best known for his roles in the science fiction series Battlestar Galactica and the ABC comedy-drama Eight is Enough.

Farrar was detained in Collin 
County on January 24 on 'two Class A Misdemeanors...for possession of a 
dangerous drug and theft'.

According
 to the website, both charges were outstanding warrants issued in Los 
Angeles. He was also reportedly charged with phone harassment.

If convicted, the 43-year-old faces a lengthy prison sentence.

In an interview with MailOnline yesterday, Rachell Costin, a younger sister of Charity, had said the family knew where the girl was, but refused to reveal her whereabouts.

Asked if the Normandie was with a relative, Rachell, 28, from Garland, Texas, said: 'I can't tell anyone that information, I wish I could, but I definitely want to let you know she is safe, so that way you don't report maybe she's still missing and report wrong information.

Rachell, who has an eight-month-old son herself, claimed her sister was a good mom.

She said: 'Charity loves her daughter so much. I can tell you that, I can tell you that Charity does love her daughter a lot and she definitely would never want her to be in an unsafe place or anything. I'm sure she does (know Normandie is in a safe place), I haven't talked to her though about that.'

Asked about the drug allegations against her sister, Rachell said: 'I know nothing about Charity and her alleged drug use, I know nothing about that.

'I don't want to even comment on the drug use, I've just known her to be the same Charity my whole life, I don't want to say whether yes or no. She really loves, her daughter, She's a good mum to her daughter.'

She added that as far as she was aware Normandie was not subject to a missing person search.

Rachell said: 'As far as I know, police here are not and police in LA shouldn't be either. I guess when they first got arrested maybe they were then, but I can let you know now she's safe. It's nobody else's business about what's going on with her.'

Trouble with the law: Farrar's girlfriend Charity Moore was also arrested nearly a week before him on a number of charges. Both were said to have been hiding out in Texas beyond the reach of LA social workers

Lengthy:
 Her charges include two counts of possession of a dangerous drug, theft
 and a misdemeanor involving a parent contributing to the child's 
failure to attend school'

Back in the day: DiCaprio and his brother used to be close, pictured attending a basketball game together in LA in 2010

Since
 2010, Farrar has been in and out of courts on charges of harassment, 
possession of controlled substances, driving without a license and 
domestic violence. 

In 2000, as DiCaprio was riding the 
success of his blockbuster Titanic, Farrar was arrested on charges that 
he attempted to kill his then-girlfriend and made terroristic threats.

At the time, Peggy DiCaprio said of her troubled son: 'Adam is one of the most nonviolent people I know,’ according to New York Daily News.

Farrar was released within 48 hours of his March 2000 arrest, and the charges against him were eventually dropped.

People Magazine
 reported that two years earlier, the struggling actor landed in trouble
 with the law after allegedly assaulting a photographer who was pursuing
 his superstar sibling. Charges were never filed in that case.
