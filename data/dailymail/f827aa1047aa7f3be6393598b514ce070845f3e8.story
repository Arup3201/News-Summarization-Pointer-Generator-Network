A group of New York artist may have created the weirdest take on the Rylstone and District Women's Institute naked calendar. 

Since the Yorkshire matrons stripped off for charity in 1999, there have been no shortage of nude calendars.

We've seen a string of naked firemen, semi-clad sports teams, stripped vets and even bare technology wizards, but this  has to rank as one of the most bizarre.

Artists from Art F City have posed naked as pandas for their calendar in a bid to raise funds to keep their blog going

Artists from Art F City have posed naked as pandas for their calendar in a bid to raise funds to keep their blog running.  

Entitled 'Artists as Pandas in the Nude,' and photographed by Rachel Stern,  it is said to feature notable artists, dealers and writers. 

The saucy shoot was reportedly inspired by the switching off of the popular 'panda cam' at  Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington, US.

The live feed of the zoo's famous resident, Mei Xiang, went down just days after she delivered her cub Bao Bao, due to a US Government shut down last year.

In a bid to beat the blackout the artists performed panda related activities 24-hours-a-day, which they then streamed live on their website.

'The whole thing was so absurd, so we decided to livestream ourselves blogging while dressed like pandas,' Paddy Johnson, AFC's founder and editor, told the LA Times. 

This inspired the nude calender that is priced £31 ($50) dollars from the Art F City website.
