Alex Cejka claimed his maiden PGA Tour title as he triumphed following a five-man play-off to win the Puerto Rico Open in Rio Grande.

The German posted a final-round score of 69 thanks to birdies on four of the first six holes, with a bogey on the 11th the only blemish on his scorecard as he finished level on seven under par alongside Emiliano Grillo, Tim Petrovic, Sam Saunders and Jon Curran.

The 44-year-old then went on to win the play-off with a birdie on the first extra hole and celebrate his first title on the PGA Tour.

American quartet Will MacKenzie, Will Wilcox, Boo Weekley and Scott Pinckney ended the day tied one shot off the pace on six under par.

Scott Brown and Chris Smith shared a one-shot lead going into the final round on six under par, ahead of their American compatriot Curran and Argentinian Grillo.

Brown struggled with a double bogey on the first hole but struck back to claim an eagle on the second to level matters before he picked up a birdie on the fifth, but two bogeys on the back nine saw him finish with 73 for the round to leave him in a six-way tie for 10th on five under.

Smith also finished in that group after carding the same score after hitting four bogeys and three birdies.
