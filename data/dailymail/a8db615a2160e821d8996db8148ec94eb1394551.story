This curious young reindeer looks as if he is ready for his close-up as he inspects a camera in the Norwegian wilderness.

Wildlife photographer Paul Goldstein was setting up for a shot of the animals in Spitsbergen, Norway, when the inquisitive creatures ambled over for a look.

Mr Goldstein, who had been lying on the ground with a long lens at a sensitive distance from the wild animals, had to freeze as they came within a few feet of him.

One of the deers then appeared to actively pose for a close-up self-portrait.

Mr Goldstein, a Wimbledon-based guide, was leading a trip to find polar bears for London travel company Exodus when he and his group came across the reindeer.

The group got off their ice breaker to get a closer view, before a couple of the curious animals made their way over to the photographer.

Mr Goldstein said: 'With any animals it is essential to be quiet, be down wind and be as still as possible.

'These reindeer were just curious initially and as they got closer I switched from a long lens to a tiny one, then just put my head down, hanging onto my camera for "deer" life and enjoyed what was a very intimate moment.

Mr Goldstein said: 'Spitsbergen is special, I love it in the land of 24 hour daylight, which is why I have been guiding special charters up here for ten years'

'They did not rush off, if it had been a bad-tempered male with a big rack it could have cost me deer.

Mr Goldstein said the trip reminded him of an encounter in Kenya's Masai Mara when a young lion appeared to pose for another's camera.

'Remarkably one young male managed to erect the tripod before setting up the shot,' he recalls.
