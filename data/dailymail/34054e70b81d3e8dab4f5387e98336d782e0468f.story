A mother and daughter have been banned from owning animals after 45 cats and dogs and a squirrel were found living in squalid conditions in their council house.

Kindred Hummer, 47, and her daughter Lauren Stead, 23, were arrested during a raid by RSPCA inspectors on their home in Beverley, East Yorkshire, in August last year.

Inside, horrified inspectors discovered 41 cats kept in just six cages in bedrooms. Four of the animals were in such terrible shape they had to be put down.

Elsewhere in the house were found four desperately ill dogs and a grey squirrel, Alfie, kept in a dark cage in the attic.

One dog, named Jenny, had to be put down by a vet, while a cream and black pug called Alfie had conjunctivitis and a prolapsed eyeball, causing him to go blind. A vet recommended both of his eyeballs be surgically removed.

A third dog, Phoebe, was found with a chronic skin condition and severely infected ears and needed four months of treatment.

At Beverley Magistrates' Court yesterday, Hummer and Stead were yesterday disqualified from owning animals indefinitely and sentenced to ten weeks imprisonment, suspended for a year

The court heard details of the appalling conditions and suffering endured by the animals living in the house.

Prosecutor Philip Brown revealed how RSPCA inspectors found 36 cats kept in five large cages and five 'exceptionally thin' cats suffering from diarrhoea in a cage in a second upstairs room.

He said: 'The sheer number of cats contained in the manner described shocked the inspector and vet.

'The failure to provide constant access to a supply of drinking water was detrimental to welfare.

'The method of housing these cats together meant they were not kept in a suitable environment and prevented from exhibiting normal behaviour patterns expected of cats.'

Tim Bishop, mitigating, said Hummer and Stead, who have since moved to Hull, were remorseful.

He said: 'While it is apparent that animals have suffered as a result of the actions or inaction of the defendants, these two individuals are not, at heart, bad people.

'They didn't set out to cause these animals harm - it's something that has arisen from the personal circumstances of the defendants, combined with simple ignorance.

'Both appear to show genuine remorse for their actions.'

As well as the 41 cats, inspectors also found four desperately ill dogs - one of whom had to be put down - and a grey squirrel kept in a dark cage in the attic

Sentencing Hummer and Stead, who each pleaded guilty to 12 charges relating to animal cruelty, magistrates chairman Lesley Wood stressed that 'a number of these animals were neglected for some time'.

The pair admitted charges including failing to provide a constant supply of fresh drinking water for 45 cats and not addressing the poor condition and weight loss of various cats.

Hummer and Stead each received a ten-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, and were ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work.

They were disqualified from owning animals indefinitely, for a minimum of five years, and ordered to pay Â£2,500 costs.

A total of 21 cats found at the home were passed to RSPCA, which will find them new homes.
