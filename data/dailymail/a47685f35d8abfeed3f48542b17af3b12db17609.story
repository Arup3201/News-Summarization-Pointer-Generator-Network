Waitrose is considering legal action to stop its internet delivery partner teaming up with Morrisons.

Ocado yesterday signed a £200million deal with the supermarket group, which charges less for groceries than upmarket Waitrose.

Bosses at Waitrose will now fear that customers could switch to Morrisons, which had been the only major chain not to offer home delivery.

They have consulted lawyers to see if they can scupper the new partnership on grounds of breach of contract.

Done deal: Morrisons' products will be delivered to customers' homes from later this year but Waitrose believes it has an exclusive deal with Ocadao.

A Waitrose spokesman said: ‘Once we’ve done that, we’ll decide what appropriate action to take.’

Morrisons has agreed a 25-year 
partnership with Ocado, which should allow the internet delivery 
business to start turning a profit.

Both firms tried to placate Waitrose 
by arguing the deal would not interfere with its delivery arrangement, 
which runs to 2020. Groceries ordered via the Morrisons website will be 
delivered in Morrisons vans.

Dalton Philips, chief executive at 
the chain, said: ‘From a standing start, Morrisons will be competing in 
the fast-growing online channel by the end of this year with a really 
compelling proposition.

‘The customer gets our affordable fresh food delivered by Ocado’s state-of-the-art distribution system.’

However he stressed: ‘This is a 
Morrisons website, it’s Morrisons food, in a Morrisons van, with a 
Morrisons driver, it’s Morrisons the whole way through.

‘It’s a very different arrangement from the sourcing arrangement Ocado has, where they source Waitrose food.’

New strategy: The deliveries will be made by a Morrisons-liveried fleet, although operations will be run by Ocado

A survey yesterday confirmed that Morrisons is cheaper than Waitrose on a range of standard products.

It charges £3.72 for a regular 
chicken compared with £5.49 at Waitrose. Cathedral City Cheddar is £4.50
 at Waitrose, more than double the offer price of £1.95 at Morrisons. 
And a 200g jar of Nescafé Gold Blend is £6.48 at Waitrose compared with 
just £4 at its rival.

Morrisons’ online operation will be 
run from Ocado’s recently opened Dordon distribution centre in 
Warwickshire. Morrisons will make an initial payment of £170million to 
Ocado to buy the site and its equipment along with a licence and 
integration fee.

It will pay service costs, a 
contribution to Ocado’s research and development programme and a share 
of earnings at Morrisons online.

The tie-up is significant because 
Britain’s online food market is growing at around 16 per cent a year and
 is set to almost double in value over the next five years to 
£11billion.

Moving forward: Morrisons chief executive Dalton Philips called the deal a 'significant strategic step' for the supermarket chain

Tom Ewing, of Fidelity, an investment
 house with a stake in Ocado, said: ‘The deal with Morrisons announced 
today is incredibly positive for Ocado.

‘It demonstrates that Morrisons agree
 with our view that online will be the primary driver of future growth 
in grocery retail in the UK and around the world.’

Mr Ewing said Ocado’s potential has been consistently underestimated by City investors.

‘This deal could mark the beginning 
of a significant shift in the market’s perception of the company and a 
recognition of the extraordinary economic value in its intellectual 
property,’ he added.

Ocado shares jumped 32 per cent yesterday to 266 pence, valuing the company at £1.54billion.

The shares have had a rollercoaster ride since the company listed at 180p in 2010. At one point they fell as low as 54p.

Ocado’s warehouses have robots that 
fetch goods from towering shelves before placing them on a maze of 
high-speed conveyor belts.

The conveyor belts whisk the products
 to attendants who follow on-screen instructions to put the right items 
into customers’ shopping bags.

A series of scales and detectors can tell when the wrong item has been put in a bag.

A computer programme then maps the most effective way to delivery groceries to 100,000 customers a week.

Waitrose has its own in-house delivery service on top of the deal with Ocado.
