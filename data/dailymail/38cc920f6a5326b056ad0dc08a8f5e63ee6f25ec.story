A toddler is said to be fighting for her life after plunging around 65ft from a fifth-floor flat.

The 16-month-old girl was rushed to hospital after the shocking incident, which shook residents in a quiet housing estate.

The incident happened around 8.30am on Saturday morning in Plymouth, Devon, and the little girl was rushed to nearby Derriford Hospital where her condition is described as stable.

It is thought the child is to be transferred to a specialist unit in Bristol.

Horror plunge: The block of flats in Plymouth, Devon, where a 16-month-old baby fell from the fifth story and survived

A resident, who did not wish to be named, said: 'It's a miracle she's survived so far, it's a long way down.

'I heard she crawled off the balcony but I'm not sure. From what I've heard, she's fighting for her life now.'

Police say the little girl sustained serious internal injuries in the huge fall, and are currently investigating the cause of the incident.

The estate contains a number of six-storey blocks of flats, some of which have concrete balconies that jut out of the side of the concrete buildings.

A resident who lives in a block 
opposite said: 'The poor little girl's mum is extremely upset. Since she
came back from the hospital, she's had people saying all sorts about 
what happened.

'I gather she
was in the kitchen at the time, so she wasn't to know how it happened. 
Unfortunately, kids are kids. The little one is in a bad way, but I 
think we're all thankful it hasn't been any worse.

'Her mum is really upset. I'm good friends with her and I've just spoken to her. She doesn't want to speak or see anyone.

'This could have happened to anyone and she was just unlucky it happened to her. The little one apparently took a turn for the worse this morning in hospital so she's not in a good way at all.'

Another concerned neighbour said: 'The mum is in pieces about it all. She needs to be left to deal with it by herself, I think.'

The block of concrete flats is one of around 14 blocks on a small street in the Barne Barton area of the city.

The balcony in which the child fell from was five floors from the ground and appears to have a glass safety barrier.

There was no police presence last night, but many residents and children were gathered outside the ground floor flat of the block of flats.
