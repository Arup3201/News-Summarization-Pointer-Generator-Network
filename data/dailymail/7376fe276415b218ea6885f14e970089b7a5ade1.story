Barcelona striker Neymar is refusing to be distracted by the impending El Clasico and Real Madrid - instead insisting that victory over Ajax in the Champions League is of paramount importance.

The Brazil striker scored in Barcelona's  3-2 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes Stadium last month, and believes hitting back with a victory in Europe's elite competition would be perfect preparation for Madrid.

'Tuesday we have a match we have to win, and only after that we will start thinking about El Clasico. What is more important for me - scoring tomorrow or scoring at the Santiago Bernabeu? Both,' Neymar said in a press conference.

Neymar considers Tuesday's game against Ajax as important as Real Madrid on Saturday for Barcelona

Luis Enrique's side were defeated 3-2 by Paris Saint-Germain in their last Champions League game 

'It will be a very difficult and a very important match against Ajax. We always play to win but I believe Ajax to be a great team both in defence and in attack. We will have to work hard to win.'

Barcelona's defeat to PSG is their only loss under manager Luis Enrique, who took over from Gerardo Martino in the summer, and the Catalan side will want to reassert their status in Group F. 

It is also the last Champions League match where Barcelona will be without striker Luis Suarez, who is set to return from his suspension and make his debut against Madrid.

Neymar is excited at the prospect of forming a three-pronged attack alongside the Uruguayan and Lionel Messi.

'For me Messi is the best player in the world, and I am happy to play with him. But Luis Suarez is there among the best too and I am sure he will bring many good things to our team.'
