A dying nurse who was suffering from terminal cancer staged her own wake called 'rave to the grave' because she wanted to see who would come to her funeral.

Grandmother Karil Harrington, of Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales, organised the party just weeks before she died so she could say goodbye to her family and friends.

More than 400 people turned up to the wake, which Mrs Harrington had been planning since being diagnosed with an inoperable liver tumour and given six months to live.

The party was held at the Dowlais Catholic Club in Merthyr Tydfil where the 65-year-old's wedding reception was held 41 years earlier, with her family helping to decorate the room with balloons and streamers.

She also banned those attending the party from crying and told anybody who started blubbing: 'Take those tears elsewhere.'

She told those at the party: 'Looking around the room fills me with the most overwhelming feeling of comfort.

'I am so grateful for this opportunity to thank you all for everything you have done for me.

More than 400 people turned up to the wake, which she organised with the help of her family and friends 

Mrs Harrington picked her favourite music by The Supremes and Aretha Franklin for the disco at the party and the food was supplied by a local takeaway 

'This could well be the last time some of you see me, but know this - life is short you've got to make the most of it.

'Life is for living every last minute.

'I'm not going to sit around moping - life is short and now mine is even shorter.

'I'm the luckiest woman on earth - to see my kids grow up and have kids of their own is a dream come true.'

Mrs Harrington chose her favourite music of The Supremes and Aretha Franklin for the disco and the food was supplied by a local takeaway who turned up with 400 portions of fish and chips.

Her daughter Llynwen, 36, said: 'She liked the idea of a party, with lots of laughter, dancing and memories.

'But she told us all: "Why should I miss out on the fun? It doesn’t seem fair after I’ve planned most of it!"

'She wanted to see all her loved ones in the same room before she passed away.

'Mum had the time of her life - she laughed and sang and partied with all her closest pals.

'She managed to get out of her wheelchair to have a dance and as I scanned the room I saw nothing but happy smiling faces.

'People had worried whether a dying woman’s party would be all doom and gloom but that wasn’t mum at all.

'There were private goodbyes and tears but they were mostly tears of joy and closure.'

At the end of the night Llynwen and her brothers Richard, 39, and Philip, 36, thanked everyone for coming and told funny stories their mother.

Mrs Harrington died with her close family around her weeks later - and cherishing the memories of her own loving send-off.

Llynwen said: 'We will always remember the party - mum really went out in style.'
