A jailed rapist launched a High Court battle claiming that sharing a cell with a smoker breached his human rights in a case costing the taxpayer thousands of pounds, it was revealed today.

Solomon Smith raped one prostitute and indecently assaulted another in 2000, and was jailed for nine-and-a-half years at Wolverhampton Crown Court two years later after being convicted.

The 52-year-old said he was forced to breathe in second-hand smoke in the cells while serving his sentence at HMP Birmingham, which damaged his health and violated his human rights.

Smith, of Hanley, Staffordshire, launched a legal battle from behind bars using taxpayers’ cash - because he could not afford his own costs - to try to claim compensation from the Government.

He claimed being made to share with the smoker for one week in March 2012 was a ‘unjustified interference’ with his right to a private and family life.

The publicly-funded case against prison operator G4S and the Ministry of Justice was dismissed at the High Court - but he then appealed the decision.

Yesterday, this was also thrown out by three senior judges at the Court of Appeal. Mr Justice Mostyn said: ‘We do not think this appeal gets off the ground - we are not impressed.’

Smith was forced to share a cell with a smoker after being moved to another part of the prison because he and other sex offenders were being bullied, the court heard.

G4S official Scott Matthewson told the court: ‘This was unfortunate but could not be avoided, given the practical and safety considerations. There were limited cells available in the prison, which was overcrowded.

‘In order to protect Smith from abusive or violent conduct from other prisoners, for a short time he had to share a cell with a vulnerable prisoner who was a smoker.’

Jonathan Hall, representing Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, said Smith’s accommodation was an operational decision for the prison.

He added: ‘Temporary exposure to second-hand smoke did not amount to an interference with the right to a private life.’

Smith had also called on the Justice Secretary to ban smoking in prison cells to ‘protect’ the country’s 85,000 prisoners, but this was also rejected.

Smoking is still allowed in Britain’s prisons despite a national smoking ban in public places being in force for six years.

Challenging the ruling, Smith’s barrister Hugh Southey QC said: ‘Prisoners are not in the position where they have some freedom of choice about how to protect their health.

‘If I feel strongly about smoking, I can take steps to avoid it.  What this case demonstrates is that prisoners are not necessarily in that position.'

Habit: The 2007 smoking ban in public places did not apply to prison cells (file picture)

Some 80 per cent of the 84,300 Prison Service inmates smoke - and tobacco is a valuable currency that is traded on the wings.

Some jails already ban the habit for bad behaviour - and 'well-behaved’ inmates look forward to their cigarette breaks out in the yard to help them through the boredom of their sentences.

But staff have long objected to breathing in the second-hand smoke of inmates, and there are fears that the Prison Service could face compensation claims from officers who claim that they are victims of passive smoking.

The 2007 smoking ban designed to protect people from the effects of second-hand smoke in public places did not apply to prison cells.

Last September, it was reported that a pilot was to be launched in some prisons that would ban inmates from smoking in all parts of the jails – including exercise yards.

But a Prison Service spokesman said there are no plans to ban smoking in jails at the moment.
