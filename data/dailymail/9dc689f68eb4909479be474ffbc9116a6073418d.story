Arsenal have been left sweating on the fitness of Olivier Giroud  after the striker was sent for a second ankle scan.

Manager Arsene Wenger may be forced to revive his interest in Loic Remy or scrap the £10million sale of Lukas Podolski if the French international striker is ruled out for any length of time.

Sportsmail understands that Giroud, who sustained the injury during the closing stages of Saturday’s 2-2 draw against Everton,  will miss at least the next two weeks and there are even fears he has suffered a broken foot, which would rule him out for months rather than weeks.

Crocked: Olivier Giroud went down against Everton and he will have a second scan on his injured ankle

Ecstasy to agony: Giroud had equalised with a bullet header moments before suffering the injury

Reinforcements: Arsene Wenger may make a move for Loic Remy to replace the injured Giroud 

Giroud originally believed he could be fit for Wednesday’s make-or-break Champions League qualifier against Besiktas, but he is now set to miss the second leg against Slaven Bilic's side. 

An initial scan failed to clear up the extent of the damage and Giroud was sent for a second examination after the inflammation of the joint had fully subsided.

A long term lay-off for Giroud, the club’s first-choice striker, would leave the club desperately short of centre-forward options and force Wenger’s hand in the transfer market.

Back of the net: The French striker scored  for Arsenal against Everton but may have broken his foot

If the Frenchman is sidelined for a sustained period of time, then Wenger could revive their interest in Queens Park Rangers striker Loic Remy.

The striker was close to joining the Gunners earlier this summer, with the north London club willing to meet his £8.5million release clause.

But Arsenal’s refusal to match his £90,000-per-week wage demands saw the deal fall through.

Giroud’s injury could also force the club into a rethink over Lukas Podolski’s future.

On his way? Lukas Podolski (right) was thought to be leaving Arsenal, but an injury to Giroud could see him stay

The Germany international wanted to leave the club in search of first-team football, and Wenger has given him the green light to depart so long as a club meets his £10million asking price.

But a serious injury to Giroud could yet see Podolski, who is wanted by Juventus, Wolfsburg and Galatasary, stay at the Emirates Stadium.

The club were faced with a similar scenario last season when dealing with Jack Wilshere’s broken foot.

Following a 50/50 challenge with Daniel Agger while playing for England in March, the midfielder was given the all clear during an initial scan on his ankle.

But a second scan showed up a hairline fracture to his left foot.

Desperate times: Wenger has been reluctant to buy another striker, but he may now be forced to do so

And the club will wait for clarification on Giroud’s second scan before fully disclosing the details of his injury.

Arsene Wenger will address the issue at Tuesday’s pre-match press conference ahead of Wednesday's Besiktas clash.

Giroud’s fitness isn’t the only selection headache for Wenger, who will also be without the suspended Aaron Ramsey following his red card in the first leg, and captain Mikel Arteta who is still suffering with an ankle injury.

Arteta is expected to be available for the Barclays Premier League showdown against Manchester City on September 13, while Yaya Sanogo is expected to return to the squad for the clash against Besiktas after a hamstring problem.

But it is Giroud’s injury that is causing Wenger the biggest concern.
