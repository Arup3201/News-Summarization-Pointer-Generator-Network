Dog lovers afraid of taking their pets for walkies in the wet and windy weather can now exercise their pooches while staying dry as a bone.

Britain's first indoor pet-walking centre has opened in Cardiff - where a former steel warehouse has been turned into 20,000sq ft park.

The city's pet owners are used to getting drenched with Cardiff topping a list of average rainfall by the Met Office, coming in with 115 centimetres a year, ahead of Glasgow and Preston. 

But now, for just £4.50 a session, dogs and owners can enjoy themselves away from the rain with features akin to soft play centres which are designed for children.

Shelley Redding said she decided to follow the American idea of indoor walkies with her Action Petz park.

Shelley, 37, said: 'It has been very popular because it is dry and safe in here for people and their pets.

'It does rain a lot unfortunately and it gets dark very early in the evenings at this time of year - so people are really enjoying bringing in their pets.'

The former dietician opened her indoor dog park three months ago with more than 600 people already paying £30 a month or £4.50 for timed sessions.

It includes toys, jumps, tunnels, sleep areas and a fly-ball play zone - and has artificial grass, park benches, plants and trees to create a natural environment for dogs to run and play.

Shelley invested £35,000  to build her indoor park at Tremorfa.

'We absolutely promise that you won't get rained on in our park, and as for mud - well there isn't any'

It has an outside zone for any dogs to cock their legs - and it kept clean if there any accidents.

Dog owner Penny Thomas, 26, said: 'I've brought my little Pug here and she loves it. I love staying dry out of the rain too.

'She gets so wet and muddy this time of the year that it is great for her to stay clean.

'Yes there are times when you want to get loads of fresh air and run around - but when you have to do walkies every day, sometimes you just want a bit of comfort!'

And Peter Simonski, 42, takes his labradoodle for an hour twice a week for the rain-free walkies.

He said: 'Sometimes you have to grit your teeth to take your dog out in the driving rain. But here it is with a smile on your face.

'I don't known how often I will be here in the summer but in the winter it is a perfect place for our family - and that includes our dog.'
