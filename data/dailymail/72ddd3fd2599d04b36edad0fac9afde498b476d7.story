Accused killer: Thomas Holland is accused of giving his young son a fatal cocktail of cocaine, codeine and acetaminophen

A Maryland father has been charged with giving his toddler son a fatal dose of cocaine earlier this year.

Thomas Holland, 38, of Palmer Park, was arrested Thursday after toxicology results from the mysterious January death of his three-year-old son showed the boy to be high on a cocktail of drugs at the time.

Investigators found toxic levels of cocaine, codeine and acetaminophen in his body, the Prince George’s County Sheriff’s Office announced.

Police said they were first made aware of the father and son January 26 after Holland drove the unresponsive boy to a local hospital.

Holland arrived that morning with the boy claiming he needed help. He was pronounced dead shortly after.

It took until testing showed drugs in the child’s system for the Office of the Medical Examiner to rule the death a homicide, police said.

Testing also showed that the dosage levels were far too high to have been ingested accidentally, cops said.

Deputies were granted an arrest warrant Thursday for the accused killer and took him into custody without incident.

The U.S. Air Force computer systems analyst, who worked at the Pentagon as recently as 2011, was charged with first-degree child abuse and manslaughter.

He is being held in the county jail.
