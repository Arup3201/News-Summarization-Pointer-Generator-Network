Appeal: Paul Lamb accompanied by daughter Lauren, left and campaigner Jane Nicklinson at the High Court in London

The decision on whether to allow two men to end their lives with medical help will not be based on sympathy for their desperate plight but on legal principles alone, the country’s most senior judge declared yesterday.

Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice, was speaking at the opening of a test case that will rule on whether those with extreme physical conditions should be able to call on doctors, family or friends to help them die.

Two men have gone to the Appeal Court to win the right to end their lives. One, Paul Lamb, 57, a former builder paralysed in a road accident 23 years ago, wants a doctor to kill him, preferably by lethal injection.

He is asking the court to guarantee that any doctor who kills him will not be charged with murder.

The second is a man with locked-in syndrome known only as Martin, who wants current legal guidelines on assisted suicide to be loosened to allow a medical professional to help him kill himself.

In a statement, Mr Lamb said: ‘I am in pain every single hour of every single day. I have lived with these conditions for a lot of years and have given it my best shot. Now I feel worn out and I am genuinely fed up with my life. I feel I cannot and do not want to keep living.

‘I feel trapped by the situation and have no way out. I am fed up of going through the motions of life rather than living it. I feel enough is enough.’

Right to die: Paul Lamb, 58, is paralysed from the neck down

Paul Bowen QC, appearing for Mr Lamb, said: ‘He feels that he is trapped in his body, that he cannot enjoy or endure a life that is so monotonous and painful and lacking in autonomy. He wishes a doctor to end his life.’

Both men say Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to privacy and family life, should give them the right to decide how their lives should end.

Lord Judge, who is sitting with the Master of the Rolls, Lord Dyson, and Lord Justice Elias, told the court: ‘We are acutely aware of the desperate situation in which these appellants find themselves, and we are very sympathetic.’

But, he added, ‘we cannot decide this case as a matter of personal sympathy’. It must be decided ‘on the basis of principles of law’.

The case comes as the former Labour Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer prepares to launch a Bill in the House of Lords tomorrow that could lead to a law allowing a doctor to end the life of a person with a terminal illness who is expected to live for less than six months.

Semantics: Lord Alex Carlile QC, left, said the terms of Lord Falconer's, right, bill are based on 'euphemisms' and criticised an attempt to call doctors helping a patient to die as 'assisted dying' rather than 'assisted suicide'

Critics say he is trying to push a right-to-die law through Parliament on the back of heart-rending court cases, and a prominent peer, Lord Carlile, has condemned him for using ‘Orwellian spin’.

Mr Lamb, a father of two, joined the case after the death last year of locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson days after the High Court rejected his plea for a doctor to kill him. Mr Nicklinson’s widow Jane is continuing his case before the Appeal Court judges.

The High Court ruled that voluntary euthanasia is murder and that it is up to Parliament, not the courts, to change the law.

Mr Lamb said outside the court yesterday that simply having the legal right to die ‘would give me peace of mind enough to prolong my life’. He added: ‘Otherwise I am constantly looking, if I want a way out, how on earth can I do it, without getting someone into trouble. I just want my wishes to be respected.’

However, he said he was ‘not confident because I’ve seen the legal system. It’s already failed people.’The hearing continues.
