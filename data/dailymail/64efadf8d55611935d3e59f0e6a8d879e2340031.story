If you'd just fallen through a ceiling at work, you might expect a little help.

But none was forthcoming for hapless shop worker Ryan Veltkamp, whose colleague appeared completely unconcerned at his plight.

Despite coming crashing down surrounded by debris, the assistant at Baneberry Golf and Resort in Tennessee was met with indifference from his co-worker and a customer browsing the store.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

'That hurt': Ryan Veltkamp lies on the floor after coming crashing through the ceiling at the shop at Baneberry Golf and Resort in Tennessee, in scenes captured on the shop's CCTV cameras on December 30

A remarkable video shows the moment Mr Veltkamp came plummetting from the loft of the shop on December 30.

At
 first, all seems quiet in the golfing supplies retailer, its 
surveillance camera looking out on a peaceful and apparently average 
day.

Then, about 20 seconds 
into the clip, a crunching, cracking sound is heard and, just a second 
later, Mr Veltkamp drops onto the shop floor, surrounded by debris.

He lands apparently quite heavily on his upper back, and just lies there.

At this point, his colleague saunters over and says: 'Hey Ryan.'

'Hey Billy,' Mr Veltkamp replies. 'That hurt.'

'Alright, don't move a muscle,' his colleague tells him.

Another man, apparently a customer, then walks over and asks, incredibly: 'Why is there a hole in the ceiling?'

'Hey Ryan': Mr Veltkamp's colleague doesn't seem overly concerned at the catastrophic mishap

'Why is there a hole in the ceiling?' A customer shows off a complete lack of any kind of powers of deduction

Despite claiming to be okay and trying to get up, Mr Veltkamp eventually thinks better of it and chooses to just stay lying where he has fallen.

Trevor Tam of Warrior Custom Golf, the company which manages the shop, told Golf.com that Mr Veltkamp had been in the attic, ironically searching for the wires that eventually captured his fall.

Thankfully, according to Mr Tam, Mr Veltkamp was 'completely unharmed' in the accident and, after a few days, they were 'able to see the comedy of it all' and made the video public.
