A senior Labour MP has triggered a new immigration storm by saying Gordon Brown was right to brand Gillian Duffy – the voter who famously challenged him – ‘a bigoted woman’.

Alex Cunningham, the MP for Stockton North, suggested to colleagues that the former Prime Minister was right to rail against Mrs Duffy on the campaign trail four years ago.

When a former Labour official brought up the incident, Mr Cunningham said he felt that Mr Brown had been ‘too grovelling and apologetic’.

Damaging: The gaffe overshadowed the 2010 campaign

He added: ‘She was a bigoted woman and that’s all there is to it'.

On a calamitous day just a week before the 2010 general election, Mrs Duffy, a retired council worker, had an impromptu chat with Mr Brown as he visited her hometown of Rochdale.

But in a gaffe which would overshadow the campaign, he left his microphone on his lapel as he was driven away. He was heard telling aides: ‘That was a disaster. You should never have put me with that woman’.

When asked by one of his staff what she had said, he replied: ‘Everything. She is just a sort of bigoted woman, she said she used to be Labour.’

Mrs Duffy, a lifelong Labour voter, had quizzed Mr Brown about the state of the public finances, how her grandchildren could afford to go to university and why her pension was being taxed.

She then moved on to immigration, telling him: ‘You can’t say anything about the immigrants….all these Eastern Europeans what are coming in — where are they flocking from?’

The grandmother said it was ‘drummed in’ to her as a child the need to help vulnerable people, but said ‘there’s too many people now’.

When his comments were made public Mr Brown went to her home to deliver a profuse apology and told journalists: ‘I don’t think she is that [bigoted].’ He said he was ‘mortified’ and claimed he had misunderstood what she had said.

Ed Miliband has insisted Labour has now been ‘on a journey’ about immigration and told an audience in Essex this week that people concerned about its impact are not prejudiced.

But at a £100-a-head fundraising dinner for MPs and supporters at a smart London hotel this month where the incident was discussed, Mr Cunningham, 59,  - a former PR executive and aide to shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan - did not take the same stance.

'I am deeply sorry. What I said was wrong and cannot be excused. I will be writing to Mrs Duffy to offer a sincere and personal apology.'

When the subject was raised at the event called ‘Labour the Media’, Mr Cunningham was recorded telling colleagues: ‘She was a bigoted woman and that’s all there is to it’.

Yesterday he issued a statement saying: ‘I am deeply sorry.  What I said was wrong and cannot be excused.  I will be writing to Mrs Duffy to offer a sincere and personal apology.’

He had been speaking after one of the panelists at the event said: ‘With the Gordon Brown incident…my personal opinion was the woman said ‘these people’ talking about eastern Europeans.

‘She also said where do these people, these eastern Europeans come from? They come from eastern Europe don’t they?

Alex Cunningham, MP for Stockton North, was recorded saying: 'Wasn't he too apologetic and grovelling to that woman? In my opinion he was.'

‘So my point is shouldn’t Gordon have said ‘she seems to me to be slightly bigoted, I only had a brief moment with her, if I offended her in any way I apologise.’

He added: ‘Wasn’t he [Brown] too apologetic and grovelling to that woman? In my opinion he was.’

The event was held two weeks ago, just ahead of the local elections in which Labour lost council seats to Ukip, which also topped the poll at the European elections.

Mrs Duffy, 69, who has said in the past she was deeply hurt by Mr Brown’s comments, did not wish to speak last night.

A widow since her husband Richard, a painter and decorator, died of cancer eight years ago, she worked with disabled children for three decades, and lives alone in the town.

In her exchange with Mr Brown, who she spotted on a campaign visit as she headed to the shops, she said: ‘My family have voted Labour all their lives. My father, even, when he was in his teens, went to Free Trade Hall, to sing the Red Flag. And now I’m absolutely ashamed of saying I’m Labour’.

Simon Danczuk, who was elected MP for Rochdale in 2010 and was with Mr Brown on the day, said he was ‘surprised’ by his colleague’s remarks.

He said: ‘Gordon was right to apologise for his comments, I think the vast majority of the public believe that. He clearly overstepped the mark. I’ve spent a lot of time with Gillian Duffy, she’s not racist she just has a concern about immigration.

‘I’m surprised there are Labour MPs who still think she was bigoted and I’m pretty disappointed. People were concerned about immigration then, and they are concerned about it now.

‘The sad thing is there’s this unhealthy consensus within the mainstream political parties that immigration is always a good thing. Sometimes it’s a bad thing and can adversely affect hard working people. It’s time to have a straight and honest debate about it.’

Tory MP Priti Patel said last night:  ‘Behind the phony public statements, this shows nothing has changed when it comes to Labour’s attitude to immigration.

'Labour opened the door to uncontrolled immigration with no thought to its impacts on communities, and as Peter Mandelson admitted, were even sending out search parties for migrants.

‘It’s the Conservatives who are building an immigration system that is fair to British citizens and legitimate migrants and tough on those who abuse the system or flout the law’.
