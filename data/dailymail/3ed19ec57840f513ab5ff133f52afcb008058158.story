A man has totally transformed his life after losing an astonishing 15st and, in the process, found love.

Rhys Jones joined a slimming club to tackle his dangerous size, losing the weight in just 20 months, and met Clare Jones, now his wife. 

Rhys, 40, weighed in at 27st 3lb and had a 50in waist at the start of his journey but has managed to reach 12st 1lb, with a 32in waistline through willpower alone.

When Rhys first began his weight loss journey his waist measured 50in

Newly slim Rhys, of Gwersyllt, Wrexham, celebrated his 40th birthday on Friday and then, in one of the happiest weeks of his life, got engaged on Saturday.

He said: 'The weight loss has changed my life. I feel fantastic.

'I suppose it all came about after my friend wanted to go to Slimming World but she didn't want to go by herself, so I went along with her.

'I used to eat everything and anything unhealthy; takeaways, burgers, pizza, and I was addicted to chocolate.

'I would just eat and eat and eat to be honest.

'I've always been a happy-chappy type so being large didn't affect me too much but obviously I wasn't very happy about it.'

Rhys shunned fad diets or surgery, instead reverting to the classic weight loss solution. 

He said: 'Healthy eating and exercise have played a key part in my weight loss but it has also taken sheer determination and willpower. It has been a case of 'just do it' really.'

Despite working hard to shed the stone, Rhys said he doesn't deny himself a good time.

He said: 'I still have a beer with the lads every now and then and enjoy myself. It isn't about just denying yourself - that's not fun.'

Rhys said walking and swimming are his main ways of keeping active, as well as biking to and from work. Rhys works as a fishmonger at Tesco in Wrexham.

Rhys is a shadow of his former self, and says it is all down to gentle exercise and moderate diet 

Last week, Rhys and Clare enjoyed a walking getaway.

He said: 'We walked about 70 miles during our time away. It was excellent.

'We spur each other on, we support one another which helps.'

Rhys said Clare has lost nearly 3st since joining the group.

On Saturday afternoon, Rhys popped the question while on a walk with Clare in Bradley.

He said: 'As a group, Slimming World members do a lot of walks together, and the first walk we went on together with them was in Bradley. So I thought I'd take us back to where we started, I'm an old romantic really.

Rhys and Clare, now engaged, enjoy walking together and Clare has even lost 3st just through following Rhys's diet and exercise regime 

'I'm just delighted she said 'yes'. As well as my achievement, I've got my gorgeous woman too.'

As well as sticking to a healthy regime, Rhys said the support of loved ones has helped him.

'Of course Clare's been brilliant but so have my family. They've been amazing and they're really proud of me which is great,' he said. 

'My housemate Becky has been smashing too. She's come along on walks with me and has been generally fantastic. I've got to say a big thank you to her.

'My Slimming World consultant Beth Jones has also been amazing, this is the first time she's given out a 15st award too.

'I just feel amazing, I feel lucky too to have these great people around me. I'm going to carry on leading a healthy lifestyle.'
