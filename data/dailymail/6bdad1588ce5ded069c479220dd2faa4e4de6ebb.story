Recent studies show that many American women have too little iodine and if pregnant, is a deficiency that may affect their child's brain development.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday, iodine is essential to babies' brain development and a lack of it can hinder a child's ability to live to his or her full potential.

NBC reports that in the past, the iodine problem was solved by adding iodine to table salt.

Iodine deficiencies in the U.S. due to the popularity of processed foods is leaving some women with a lack of the mineral that can lower their child's IQ

Unfortunately, iodine is no longer a part of the common American diet as most of the salt consumed in the U.S. comes from processed foods, said pediatrician Dr.Jerome Paulson.

Women who are vegan and who don't eat fish are also likely to have an iodine deficiency.

Even though an iodine deficiency affects a child's brain, it isn't likely that it will cause a learning disability.

'The brain development issues are very subtle and are not likely to be noticed in an individual child,' Paulson explained.

'It's an issue for society as a whole when you have a large number of children who are not reaching their full potential.'

Paulson said that children will appear to be normal but that they may not be the greatest they could be.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, iodine is essential to babies' brain development and taking anywhere from 150- 290 micrograms per day can higher a child's IQ

According to the New York Daily News, Whether or not a woman has an iodine deficiency doesn't dictate whether or not she should take a supplement.

In fact, all pregnant mothers and women of child bearing age are urged to take a dose of the mineral.

Pregnant woman should take 220 micrograms a day and breastfeeding moms should take up to 290 micrograms

In addition to taking iodine, women should also take vitamin D in their prenatal vitamin regimen.

'I think the main thing is that the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] should make sure that prenatal vitamins contain all the essential nutrients,' Garibaldi said.

'It's very important that vitamins such as Vitamin D which is useful in calcifying bones, and elements such as iodine be part of prenatal vitamins.'

Pediatricians say an iodine deficiency can also increase a mother and her baby's vulnerability to tobacco and certain chemicals in drinking water.Â
