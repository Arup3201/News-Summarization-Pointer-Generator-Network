Shamed former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn 'was fully aware' that young girls at orgies were being paid to have sex with him, a prostitute has told a court in France.

The disgraced economist came face-to-face with the 30-year-old Belgian call girl during a pre-trial hearing into accusations he was part of a global vice network.

Strauss-Kahn, 64, insists he only ever had sex with 'willing young women' at sleazy swingers parties around the world.

But the hooker named Jade told a judge in the French town of Douai on Thursday that the man once tipped as a future president of France KNEW the girls were prostitutes.

Strauss-Kahn is appealing a decision to send him to trial on charges of 'aggravated pimping as part of an organised gang', when he faces a maximum of 20 years in prison.

His latest court appearance was aimed at discovering if he genuinely believed that young women in their 20s were having sex with him for free.

According to a judicial source quoted in French newspapers today, Jade told the court: 'He was fully aware we were prostitutes being paid to have sex.'

The same prostitute revealed last year how she was flown to Washington DC, where she had sex with Strauss-Kahn at the city's four-star W Hotel.

Then the next day, the International Monetary Fund boss even took her to his office at the institution where he managed the stability of the world's finances.

But Jade also praised Strauss-Kahn for his 'courtesy and respect' during the sleazy swingers' parties.

In an interview with France's Nord-Eclair newspaper in March 2012, she told how hookers at an orgy in Paris waited for Strauss-Kahn 'like the arrival of the Messiah'.

She added: 'When he turned up, everyone was very admiring of him. He always had a certain charisma about him, an aura.

'I must say, I found DSK to be very pleasant and overly polite.

'Each encounter with him was mutually respectful. I have always ensured I am seen as a woman and not an object.'

Strauss-Kahn is one of four Frenchmen charged with conspiring with pimps to procure girls for orgies in Paris, Lille, New York and Washington DC.

He is also accused of knowing fraudulently obtained money was being used to fund the vice network based in the northern French city of Lille.

The looming trial in France is the last in a catalogue of sex scandals that began when Strauss-Kahn was arrested for trying to rape a New York hotel chambermaid in May 2011.

After being held in New York's notorious Ryker's Island prison, criminal charges were dropped and he recently paid hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo four million pounds in a civil settlement.

He returned to France last year only to face similar accusations of sexually abusing a young French writer.

When those allegations were also dropped, he was then confronted with the latest claims he used knowingly used hookers supplied by the Lille vice network.

His lawyer Richard Malka has described Strauss-Kahn as 'simple swinger' whose only crime was giving in to his 'lustful urges'.

Mr Malka said his client intended to appeal every decision to send him to trial, branding the charges 'as false as they are absurd'.

Strauss-Kahn remains under 'judicial control' on Â£85,000 bail until a new date is set for his appeal hearing in the French Cour de Cassation.

The hugely experienced economist has meanwhile made a discreet return to public life, giving a speech on the global finances in China and advising the Greek government on their massive debts.
