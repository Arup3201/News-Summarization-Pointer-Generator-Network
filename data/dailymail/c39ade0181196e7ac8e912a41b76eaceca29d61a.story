It was carefully restored only two years ago and takes pride of place in a primary school’s assembly hall.

But now a mural featuring a golliwog is at the centre of a remarkable police investigation after a parent made an official complaint.

Margaret Rocha, 43, contacted police, councillors and MSPs after spotting the image during a visit to Wardie Primary School in Edinburgh, as she considered applying for a place for her son.

The mural, which was painted in 1936 by RH Westwater and features scenes from Alice in Wonderland across nine panels, features a golliwog

She said she was astonished to see the mural, which was painted in 1936 by RH Westwater and features scenes from Alice in Wonderland across nine panels.

It was restored in 2011 with a £17,600 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF).

Police Scotland is now investigating the ‘hate incident’ – with the HLF also reviewing the situation.

Council bosses have resisted pressure to remove or cover up the artwork at the school in the north of the city – but have introduced extra anti-racism lessons.

Mrs Rocha said she found the image ‘deeply offensive’ and would now look for a different school for her son.

She added: ‘I raised it with the headteacher and she shrugged her shoulders and didn’t seem to think it was an issue. It’s an inappropriate image for a primary school hall.

‘It’s one thing if it was a museum piece or an exhibition, where you might explain what a swastika was or a Ku Klux Klan outfit.

‘It goes back to the American Black Sambo – the blacked-up face.’

In the mural, the golliwog is sitting on an alcove ledge above the Alice in Wonderland figure in the central panel.

The mural and Wardie’s distinctive architecture are well-known in academic circles. The school is part of the international Decorated School project set up to study the art and architecture of school buildings, funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council.

Experts said they were unclear as to why the golliwog was included in the  first place as it does not feature in Lewis Carroll’s story.

They have speculated that it may have been added to promote Robertson’s jam, which used to feature a golliwog character named Golly on its logo.

A Police Scotland spokesman said: ‘Police in Edinburgh have received a complaint in relation to a mural at a primary school in the Trinity area. Officers are now liaising with the City of Edinburgh Council’s education department with regards to this matter.

‘Police Scotland treats all reports relating to hate incidents extremely seriously and will thoroughly investigate whenever a report of this nature is made.’

The HLF admitted it was unlikely its staff had inspected the mural, since the grant was a small sum awarded under its fast-track scheme.

Colin McLean, head of HLF Scotland, said: ‘The Heritage Lottery Fund supported the restoration of a historic mural based on scenes from Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland at  Wardie Primary School.

‘We will be discussing this issue with the school over the coming week.’

The council refused to consider covering up the image but said it would now use additional teaching packs at the school from campaign group Show Racism the Red Card.

A spokesman insisted that the council and school take diversity and anti-racism extremely seriously.

She said: ‘The mural is of both historical and artistic importance.

‘While we understand the offensiveness of the image, it is in no way indicative of the attitudes of either the school or the council.

‘Our equalities policies and approaches are robustly multicultural and anti-racist.’

Jeremy Howard, a co-ordinator of the Decorated School project from the University of St Andrews, said: ‘This is history. If you start painting it out or get rid of it you’re deceiving people about what views were prevalent in the 1930s.

‘I think once children are being taught about issues of race, social issues and human rights – especially as they get to Primary 6 or Primary 7 – that could definitely be the time to introduce it.

‘It seems to me to be a perfect tool for that, saying that in the past the establishment didn’t even blink an eye at having this here, but we do now.’

Councillor Allan Jackson said: ‘I have seen this mural before and appreciate this is an awkward one.

‘I can understand people being offended given the subject matter. However, it’s complicated by the fact it’s a part of the history of the school.

‘I will raise this with parents. There is an argument for using it to educate pupils as to views of the past. Then again, at  primary age this might not be the most appropriate time.’

Alan McKenzie of the Scottish Secondary Teachers’ Association added: ‘If a  parent has expressed genuine concern over such an image, then clearly this needs to be reviewed.’
