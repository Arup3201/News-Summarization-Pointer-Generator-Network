This three-bedroom property in Clerkenwell, now on the market at £3 million, comes with its own little piece of gastronomic history. It's where Jamie Oliver first launched his TV career in the original series of The Naked Chef. 

If you cast your mind back to 1999 you might remember the spiral staircase which featured in the opening credits, the cobbled street on which Jamie parked his moped, and the kitchen where he’d whip up his unique brand of ‘pukka tukka’.

Unsurprisingly, 15 years later, the well-used kitchen has since been refurbished.

Jamie lived in the house with his wife Jools during the filming of the first two series of the show, courtesy of the BBC.

In 2001 team Oliver moved up the property ladder to a new home and the move featured in the first episode of season three.

At the time, filming a cooking series in the chef’s home rather than in a traditional chef’s kitchen was an exciting new concept.

Each week Jamie would rustle something up in the kitchen and then share his creations with friends or family.

Jamie was often seen speeding up the cobbled street on his moped

So potential buyers can rest assured that the property has been tried and tested for both cooking and entertaining. 

Since Jamie and Jools moved out of the little house in Chequer Street, the property has been updated to include fibre-optic mood lighting, a bespoke spa bathroom (including waterproof plasma screen), and an en suite in both bedrooms with a rain-fall shower. 

But there’s no indication on estate agent, Stirling Ackroyd’s website of the house’s famous past, apart from a subtle reference to it being a ‘special home’.

The luxury pad is now also fitted with a top of the line computer system, which controls the lighting, blinds, air conditioning, TVs, security cameras and alarm. 

John Athanasiou, Clerkenwell Sales Manager for Stirling Ackroyd, says, ‘When you go up the spiral staircase in this particular property, people can’t help but be impressed with the bright and beautifully space.

‘Advice we always give potential vendors is to maximise the kitchen and reception room when trying to sell a property, as it is often these rooms that buyers fall in love with, and can picture themselves living in.’

So if you can picture yourself stepping into Jamie and Jools’s shoes, all you need is £2,995,000.
