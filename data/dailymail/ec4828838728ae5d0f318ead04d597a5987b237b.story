A smiling Adelene Leong flashes peace signs into the camera as she enjoys her time at the Royal Adelaide Show, not knowing her day was about to take a fatal turn.

On Friday about 12.30pm, the eight-year-old - who was holidaying with family from Malaysia - was thrown from the Air Maxx 360 ride as her mother watched on in horror.

Adelene was rushed to hospital with critical injuries but died a short time later.

Five days later, South Australia police have released a photo of the girl from the same day of her terrible death, hoping it will trigger new witnesses to come forward with more information as they investigate how the tragedy happened.

Adelene Leong's mother has publicly paid tribute to her eight-year-old daughter

The photo was handpicked by her mother who was believed to be with Adelene at the time of the incident.

Along with the photo, Adelene's mother paid tribute to her eight-year-old in a statement, describing her as 'my lovely beautiful….wonderful little angel of my heart'.

Police hope the photograph will prompt showgoers to recognise her.

'In particular we are keen to hear from anyone who may have taken photographs or video footage of the ride involved – the Airmaxx 360 – in action at the Showgrounds on Friday,' Chief Inspector Selena Dinning, from the Sturt Local Service Area, said.

'We are also keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time of this tragic incident or anyone who experienced anything unusual on the ride.

'Even a small detail may be the crucial information which leads to a clear understanding of what took place.'

The child was in a critical condition after the terrifying fall

So far, police have spoken with 30 to 40 people in relation to the show ride.

Chief Insp Dinning said the ride had a minimum height requirement of 120cm, which Adelene exceeded.

'The ride has been seized by SafeWork SA and at this time remains in situ,' she added.

'Police are continuing to work with SafeWork SA to fully investigate the cause of this tragic incident and are preparing a report for the coroner.'

Following Adelene's death, a second ride, the Traffic Jam, was shut down the following day when a height restriction breach was identified.

SafeWork SA officers also increased the number of inspections and compliance checks at the show.

The girl was taken by ambulance to the Women's and Children's Hospital

Previously, the agency has said an investigation into Adelene's death was expected to take some time, given the nature of the incident, the number of witnesses involved and the technical expertise required.

Witnesses reportedly saw the girl being thrown from the seat and 'landing extremely far away'.

On the day of the accident, Malinda Dunwoodie, 17, told The Advertiser the girl's safety harness was still down but it looked as if she slipped out of her seat.

'She was hanging by her legs off the ride, trying to block herself. She went flying through the air about 10-15 metres up in the air and I started sprinting towards her,' she said.

'I was shaking so much, she looked like a doll flying through the air.

'It was so shocking. It was like a horror movie.'
