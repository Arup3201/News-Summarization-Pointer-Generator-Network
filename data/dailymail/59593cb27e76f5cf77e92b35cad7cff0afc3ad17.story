The Premier League is back and with it comes the usual array of compelling sub-plots and unanswered questions.

Will Radamel Falcao come good? What next for Newcastle? Is Roberto Martinez able to build a defence as well as an attack? Are Diego Costa’s hamstrings an accident waiting to happen and what would that do to Chelsea, the runaway leaders?

So, is Sterling still tired?

We may be just seven games into the new season, but Raheem Sterling is already complaining of being fatigued. So much so, he asked Roy Hodgson to leave him out of the starting XI for England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia on Sunday. 

The Three Lions manager is expected to meet up with Sterling when Liverpool travel to Queens Park Rangers on Sunday. Reports he has bought Sterling a pillow for the long journey back to Anfield are said to be wide of the mark.

Falcao finding his feet  

We’ve had the revelation that he’s part Yorkshireman but what Manchester United fans would far prefer is a reminder of Radamel Falcao’s striking ability.

His pre-United goals-to-games ratio of 200:305 is simply incredible and he is arguably the best finisher in football. But he only has one goal in four for United and that is not good enough.

Is he over that terrible knee injury he suffered last season? Is he still adapting to the Premier League? Answers to these questions ought to reveal themselves over the next couple of months, starting with Monday’s trip to West Brom.

Can Man City close the gap at the top in early kick-off?

Giving Jose Mourinho an early advantage does not seem like the smartest idea. But that is what Manchester City have done, falling five points behind after seven games. 

Their inferior goal difference (+7 versus Chelsea’s +14) effectively makes that a six-point gap and also highlights that they need more goals. 

City need to address that gap quickly and start with a tricky home fixture against Tottenham on Saturday. Spurs’ dire record against top-four sides however, will count in the champions' favour.

Can Palace repeat last season’s shock by beating Chelsea?

March 29 – Palace 1 Chelsea 0. It was one of the most stunning results of the season, playing a huge role in Palace’s survival and Chelsea’s failure to win the title.

Palace are not facing the same struggles in the early part of this season as last, but it would be a monumental upset if Chelsea lost on Saturday.

What will happen to Costa’s mysterious hamstrings?

He has been the missing link. Jose Mourinho did plenty of moaning last season about his striking options and Costa has proven just how useful an in-form predator can be.

His tally for the season is a stunning nine in seven Premier League games, which goes a fair distance to explaining their early dominance. 

But he is operating under a cloud, with Mourinho frequently citing the fragility of his hamstrings. They have been problematic for him in the past, though Arsene Wenger recently smirked when asked if he thought Mourinho’s regular mentions of problems were a smokescreen. If they are an issue, it would surely have a drastic effect on Chelsea’s season.

Life after Luis

It’s lost on very few that Liverpool have 10 points and sit ninth compared with 16 points and top spot at this time last season.

One worrying truth is that Liverpool’s fast start last season owed little to Luis Suarez, who was serving another of his biting bans. His impact was felt from roughly this time of year and onwards, so it will be fascinating to see how they go from here on in. They play at QPR on Sunday.

Sack race – who will go next?

So far only Neil Warnock has come in during the campaign, which is fairly standard as historically this unsavoury aspect of a season doesn’t tend to get going until November.

There are suggestions that Harry Redknapp’s position is under threat, with Tim Sherwood reportedly lined up to step into his role. And Alan Pardew is the subject of near constant speculation, either from the stands or smoking porches of Soho pubs.

Sam Allardyce is forever considered to be in range of a boot to the backside, but West Ham’s fine start ought to have allayed those suspicions.

Martinez has to prove he can build a defence

Roberto Martinez has often faced questions on his ability to build a defence as capable as his attacks. It is often cited that his exciting team at Wigan had the firepower to continue defying the odds by staying up, but were undermined too much by a leaky backline. 

Now his Everton side are sitting 17th with the worst record for goals conceded in the division – 16. To make the issue even more clear, they have scored 13, which is bettered only by Chelsea and Manchester City. So it is obvious where the problem lies. And it is down to Martinez to prove what he can do at both ends of the pitch.

Pardew and the Newcastle situation

Will he walk away? Will Mike Ashley swallow the cost of paying off the remainder of his contract and sack him? Will he get the best out of these players and end the discussion? 

Certainly, there is trouble in the north. Hefty chunks of the support are neither behind the board nor the manager and the team sit in the bottom three. Something needs to change.

The Koeman effect

It turns out that reports of Southampton’s demise were greatly exaggerated, to adapt a cliche. Ronald Koeman has had a stunning effect since taking over, with this club continuing to prove its survival skills. It was expected to perish after Nigel Adkins left, when Nicola Cortese left, when Mauricio Pochettino left… But still Southampton are going strong.

Their squad acknowledge that Christmas was a tricky patch for them last season, but they have a good run of fixtures coming up and will need to build up steam ahead of another tough festive schedule.

Southampton are third in the table having lost just one of their opening seven matches of the new campaign
