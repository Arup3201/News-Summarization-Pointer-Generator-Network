The newly crown Miss Teen USA has now come forward with new details of the moment a hacker revealed himself and tried to extort her with nude photos he took using her own computer's webcam.

Without her knowledge, the hacker could watch and photograph Cassidy Wolf, a 19-year-old who took the Miss Teen USA crown in early August. He contacted Wolf and threatened to go public with the photos unless she gave him a special 'performance.'

Now the college freshman is speaking out against so-called 'sextortion' in order to spread the word and teach other young women how to avoid it.

Revealed: Cyber crime victim and Miss Teen USA Cassidy Wolf gave new details on Today about her alleged 'sextortion'

'I was terrified,' she said Thursday in an interview with Today. 'I started screaming, bawling my eyes out. I was on the phone with my mom, and I felt helpless because I wasn't sure what to do, so it was a very terrifying moment.'

Through an anonymous email address, the cyber stalker attempted to extort Wolf for sexual favors, hence the term 'sextortion.'

'You would never think somebody would be watching you in your room and this guy had been,' Wolf said. 'The thought of that just gave me nightmares.'

These are the first details the beauty queen has released on her experience since she revealed she was the victim of cyber crime just after she was crowned.

But the incident actually occurred four months before Wolf won her current title.

'It happened to me when I was a normal girl and it can happen to anybody,' she said. 'The message is to tell somebody.'

Wolf immediately called her mom, who reported the incident to police.

The FBI is now on the case.

Instructive: Wolf told Today that she's trying her best to turn the negative experience into a learning experience she can share with others

The Temecula, California native now travels the country to tell her story and warn other teenagers about cyber-crime.

'The longer it goes on, the worse it will get, so if you can get the word out,' she urged. 'Talk to the authorities.'

Shock: Cassidy Wolf, from California, was crowned as Miss Teen USA 2013 in the Bahamas

Winner: She hopes to use her year-long reign to raise awareness of cyber-crimes after her own experience

Speaking to Today.com,
 Wolf initially revealed the crime just after she beat 51 other young 
women to take the Miss Teen USA title at a pageant in the
 Bahamas.

'I was just a normal girl in high 
school,' she said.

Around four months ago, she was notified that someone had tried to log into her Facebook account from a different state, Today.com reported.

She then received an anonymous email from a stranger saying he had photographs of her in her room that were taken when her computer's webcam was hacked.

'I wasn't aware that somebody was 
watching me [on my webcam],' she said. 'The light [on the camera]
didn't even go on, so I had no idea.'

She would not provide further details of the nature of the photographs, citing the ongoing federal investigation, but told Fox that they captured things you would do 'in the privacy of your own room'.

She added the stranger tried to extort her, saying that the photos would then not be leaked.

'You just need to be so extremely careful with what you do online nowadays because you never know what people can be doing to you online,' she told Fox.

After she was named Miss California, Miss Wolf traveled to schools near her home in Temecula to talk with students about how to protect themselves from cyber-crimes.

During her one-year reign, she hopes to spread her story as a warning to others.

'This next year I’m just so excited to be able to share my story 
and raise awareness in young teens about what can happen,' she said.

Warning: She now visits local schools to warn others of her story and to give tips in online safety

She said that people can protect themselves by changing their passwords frequently and deleting browsing history regularly. She also suggested putting a sticker over the webcam when it's not being used.

Wolf, an avid dancer since the age of two, plans on continuing this work even when she begins classes at the New York Film Academy this year.

She said she was 'shocked and overwhelmed' to win the pageant on Saturday after just two years of competing in contests.

'I don't remember how I was feeling,' she said. 'I was crying, I was so happy.'
