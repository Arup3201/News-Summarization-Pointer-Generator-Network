A mother plans to breastfeed her premature baby while continuing to smoke marijuana -  against the advice of the doctors who delivered her child.

Crystal Cain gave birth to her daughter Karrisma eight weeks early last Wednesday at Oregon Health and Sciences University in Portland.

Because her premature baby's immune system was already fragile, she planned to breastfeed but says doctors refused.

Doctors at OHSU in Portland, Oregon kept a mother from breastfeeding her newborn after they discovered she was smoking marijuana. The eventually allowed the insistent mother after having her sign a form that acknowledges all the risks

While baby Karrisma is doing fine and has been taken off breathing machines, Cain disagrees with the doctor's advice.

'There are several studies that indicate that it doesn't, it can't transfer through your milk ducts.  Your body automatically kind of filters it,' Cain told KATU.

Cain says she smoked marijuana throughout her pregnancy because her midwife said it would alleviate her nausea and anxiety.

While the effects of marijuana on breastfed children has not been thoroughly studied since the drug is illegal in most states, the American Academy of Pediatrics advises against the practice.

Some studies say children who consume breast milk from a marijuana-smoking mother are at higher risk of sudden infant death syndrome and that it may impact development.

In the end, doctors at OHSU compromised with Cain by allowing her to breastfeed as long as she signed a form saying she understands the risks involved.

'We do understand the benefits of mothers' milk,' Dr Charles Kilo, OHSU's chief medical officer, said. 'We also don't want to be caught in a situation where a mother continues to use and says that we never gave her information on it, never informed about the risks, and so it's really a way of documenting that the parents acknowledge the risks. And we can't stop her from using it.'

With recreational marijuana legalized in neighboring Washington, and medical marijuana in widespread use in Oregon, Cain believes more and more mothers are going to be demanding to breastfeed their children while taking the drug.

Cain hopes this will lead to more research being done on the effects of breastfeeding while smoking marijuana.

Oregon mothers breastfeed their children more than women in any other state, at an overwhelming 90 per cent rate.
