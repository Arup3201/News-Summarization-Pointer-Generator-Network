Floyd Mayweather continues his preparation and training for the Fight of the Century against Manny Pacquiao as the pair prepare for a $300m face-off on May 2 in Las Vegas.

The unbeaten 38-year-old has once again shared some images from inside his training camp, this time including some skipping and pad work with his father Floyd Mayweather Sr.

Mayweather has previously shared pictures and videos with the boxing universe, including one workout with Phil Collins playing in the background.

Pacquiao, meanwhile, has also posted videos on Instagram of his group run. 

The pair's preparation continued as it was announced that they had agreed that their mega-fight would be conducted under the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) testing program.

The Las Vegas showdown will observe the rules established under the World Anti-Doping Code (Code), the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Prohibited List and the USADA Protocol for Olympic and Paralympic Movement Testing.

Both fighters have agreed to unannounced blood and urine testing without reservation and will be tested out of competition prior to the fight and in competition after the fight.

The inspector called at the house, where Pacquiao was relaxing with members of his team between work-outs with master trainer Freddie Roach at the fabled Wild Card Gym.

The PacMan readily complied with tests for both blood – a process about which he had previously expressed his dislike – and urine.

‘No problem,’ he told the medic, with a smile.
