Samir Nasri’s girlfriend leapt to the Manchester City player’s
defence as he faced a social media backlash after posting a picture of a crude salute from inside a nightclub.

Despite inspiring Manuel Pellegrini’s side to Premier League
glory last season, the 27-year-old was incredibly overlooked by France boss Didier
Deschamps for the World Cup in Brazil.

And as his compatriots prepare for their crunch
quarter-final clash against Germany on Friday afternoon, Nasri began the day
courting controversy with his Instagram snap that showed him displaying a crude
one-figure gesture with an accompanying message: 'Tell a hater I say... F**k
you, F**k you, F**k you'.

Nasri’s crass words are believed to be taken from song
lyrics, but his model girlfriend Anara Atanes was forced to defend him as he
came under fire from fans, who appeared more concerned about where the picture
was taken, rather than the offensive salute itself.

The Muslim midfielder was slammed for posting a picture of
himself at a nightclub during the holy month of Ramadan.

The picture is understood to be taken from Nasri’s holiday
in Las Vegas earlier this summer and there was no suggestion that the player
was involved in anything untoward his religious beliefs.

But Brighton-born model Atanes was quick to defend her man
from any criticism as she posted: ‘Yes hes [sic] fasting! Even on his holiday!’

Atanes was involved in a social media storm earlier this
summer when she hit out at Deschamps for not picking the former Arsenal ace to
go to Brazil.

Deschamps threatened to file a civil law suit against her
after she wrote ‘F*** France and f*** Deschamps’

Atanes has since set her account to private after it caused
a stir with Deschamps, but her comments defending Nasri were visible for all to
read.

Nasri is due to return back to pre-season training next week
and is understood to be set to sign a new, improved long-term deal at the
Etihad Stadium.
