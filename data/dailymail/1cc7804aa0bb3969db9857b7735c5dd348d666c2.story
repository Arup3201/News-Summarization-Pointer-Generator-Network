Socialite Lady Victoria Hervey has sparked fury for tweeting a picture of bruising she suffered on a bobsleigh and claiming she was rocking the 'battered housewife look'.

The photo shows her posing in front of a bathroom mirror and revealing bruising on the underside of her arm which she sustained while training for the upcoming series of reality TV show The Jump.

In the caption underneath the photo, the 38-year-old wrote: 'Rocking the battered housewife look. New war wounds from bobsleigh, can we please get an arnica sponsor asap!'

But her apparent suggestion the bruising was comparable to injuries suffered by victims of domestic violence has been branded 'vile'.

One Twitter user said Lady Victoria's pictured and accompanying comment disgusted her

Victims counsellor Kel Ashley said: 'It's just the sort of comment I'd expect the privileged elite to come out with,' The Mirror reported.

She added: 'No one "rocks the battered wife look". They endure being a being a battered wife and hope it never happens to them again.'

It also provoked anger online, with one Twitter user writing that it proved how 'utterly trivially' domestic violence was treated.

They added: 'It needs to change. It's not a joke. Ever.'

Training for the second season of Channel 4's The Jump is currently taking place in Austria, with celebrities including Joey Essex, Ashley Roberts and Mike Tindall competing across a range of winter sports.

Lady Victoria has previously tweeted about the rough and tumble required for the series - on January 7, she wrote: 'Feeling really beaten up from the skeleton. Wrist and ankle. Can't wait till that bit is over. #TheJump #Innsbruck.'

Nor is it the first time contestants on the show have been injured - Sally Bercow and Ola Jordan were both replaced after sustaining injuries.

Bercow, 45, was forced to pull out after breaking two ribs while training in Austria, while Jordan, 32, suffered a serious leg injury. 

MailOnline has requested comment from Lady Victoria's publicist.

Lady Victoria also hit the headlines last week after she revealed the extraordinary request made to ensure she remains relaxed during The Jump – she insisted that producers pay for her new puppy to be flown out to be with her wherever the show is filmed.

Her six-month-old Norfolk terrier, D’Artagnan, will go back and forth from Los Angeles, where she lives, to Britain, Germany and Austria, covering 17,500 miles.

She said: ‘That was part of the agreement. I got it in my contract. The training is very difficult, so when we have had a long day he acts as a bit of a stress reliever for everyone.’

Lady Victoria had just bought the puppy in October from a breeder in Stafford when she was approached for the series.

She was so anxious about leaving him that she asked for a special contract clause guaranteeing his air travel costs would be covered.

Before Christmas, he flew with her from London to LA, at a cost of £1,000, for two weeks. Then he flew back to join Lady Victoria for training at an indoor ski slope in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire.
