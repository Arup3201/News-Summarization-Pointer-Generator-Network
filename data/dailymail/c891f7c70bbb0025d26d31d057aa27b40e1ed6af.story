Two Oklahoma men suspected in a Good Friday shooting rampage that left three people dead and terrorised Tulsa's African-American community appeared in court today and had bond set at more than $9 million each.

Jake England, 19, and Alvin Watts, 32, appeared via closed-circuit television from jail. Both are being held on suspicion of three counts of first-degree murder, two counts of shooting with the intent to kill and one count of possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony. They will be formally charged at a later date.

Neither man had an attorney present on Monday. The judge set bond at $9.16 million apiece and scheduled their next appearance for April 16.

Police have identified both suspects 
as white, while all five victims in the early Friday shootings were 
black. Police and the FBI cautioned that it was too early to say whether
the attacks in Tulsa's predominantly black north side were racially 
motivated.

Police spokesman Jason Willingham said that based on Facebook
postings attributed to England, a wish to avenge the death of his 
father Carl England might have been a factor.

On Thursday, two years after Carl England was killed, England took to Facebook to rage about the 
'f****** n*****' who shot his father to death.

England 
wrote on his Facebook wall: 'Today is two years that my dad has been 
gone shot by a f****** n****** it's hard not to go off.'

He also mentioned Sheran Wilde, 24, his girlfriend and the mother of his young son, who committed suicide in January.

'between
that and sheran I'm gone in the head. RIP. Dad and sheran I. Love and 
miss u. I think about both of u every second of the day,' he wrote on 
his public Facebook profile.

Later that night, England and Watts drove
through black neighborhoods in northern Tulsa in a white pickup truck 
and gunned down five strangers near the spot where England's father 
died, according to police.

'It's apparent from the posting on 
the Facebook page that he had an ax to grind, and that was possibly part
of the motive,' Willingham said. 'If you read the Facebook post and see
what he's accused of doing, you can see there's link between the two of
them.'

Racist tirade: The day before the Good Friday shootings, Jake England against the 'f****** n*****' who shot and killed his father Carl England

The Facebook page had been taken down by Sunday afternoon.

A family friend, Susan Sevenstar, 
told The Associated Press that England was 'a good kid' and 'a good, 
hard worker,' who 'was not in his right mind' after losing his father 
and his fianc√©e.

'If anybody is trying to say this is a
racial situation, they've got things confused,' said Sevenstar, who 
described England as Cherokee Indian. 'He didn't care what your colour 
was. It wasn't a racist thing.'

The Tulsa World reported that 
England's father, Carl, was shot in the chest during a scuffle with a 
man who had tried to break into his daughter's apartment. The man charged in the shooting is serving a six-year sentence on a
weapons charge, according to Department of Corrections records.

On April 5, 2010, Carl England, 47, 
showed up at the apartment complex where his daughter lived with her 
boyfriend. The boyfriend had gotten into a fight with Pernell Jefferson, 40, 
and had hit him with a baseball bat, the Tulsa World reported at the 
time.

Jefferson, who had been in prison on 
drug and weapons charges, then tried to break into the couple's 
apartment but left, saying he planned to 'settle the dispute.'

England
and his daughter's boyfriend went looking for Jefferson at the 
apartment complex. When the found him, England hit him with a stick and 
knocked him to the ground.

Jefferson pulled out a gun and shot England in the chest, the World reported, killing him.

Carl
England was killed at 3608 N. Quaker Ave. in northern Tulsa. All of the
Good Friday shootings occurred within four miles of the apartment 
complex where he died. Most were much closer.

On Sunday, acting on an anonymous tip and backed
by a helicopter, police followed England and Watts from the home they 
shared in Turley, just north of Tulsa, and arrested them without incident, police 
said.

Task force commander Maj. Walter 
Evans said investigators recovered a weapon but that it was not clear 
who fired the shots. They also found a truck that had been burned.

The Rev. Warren Blakney Sr., 
president of the Tulsa NAACP, said the arrests came as a relief.

'The community once again can go about its business without fear of there being a shooter on the streets,' Blakney said.

Police Chief Chuck Jordan said the 
gunmen appeared to have chosen their victims at random. Four shooting victims were found in yards and the fifth in a street. Police 
identified those killed as Dannaer Fields, 49, Bobby Clark, 54, and 
William Allen, 31.

Fields was found wounded about 1am 
Friday, Clarke was found in a street about an hour later, and Allen was 
discovered in the yard of a funeral home about 8.30am.

Minutes after Fields was found, 
police found two men with gunshot wounds in another yard two blocks 
away. They were taken to hospitals in critical condition but expected to
survive, police said. Their names have not been released.

The shootings come at a fraught 
moment for black Americans. In late February, an unarmed black teen, 
Trayvon Martin, was fatally shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer in 
Sanford, Florida, raising questions about racial profiling and touching 
off protests across the nation.

While Tulsa police were reluctant to describe the shootings there as racially motivated, City Councilman Jack Henderson was not.

'Being an NAACP president for seven 
years, I think that somebody that committed these crimes (was) very 
upset with black people,' Henderson said. 'That person happened to be a 
white person, the people they happened to kill and shoot are black 
people. That fits the bill for me.'

Black community leaders met on Friday as fears mounted about the attacks to calm unrest and promote safety.

NAACP Tulsa president, the Rev. Warren
Blakney Sr., told the World that the shooter appeared to be 'targeting 
black people to shoot.'

'I'm on edge for my people,' Blakney said as he argued that the crime was clearly racially motivated.

Close proximity: The five shooting victims were found at four locations within four miles of the apartment complex where Jake England's father was killed two years ago

Troubled: Jake England (left) made posts on his Facebook page that showed he struggled with the deaths of his father and of the mother of his young son. His friend, Watts, is also his accomplice, according to police

'When there are reports that someone systematically shot black folk, what is one left to believe?' he told reporters.

On Saturday, police chief Chuck Jordan 
described the shootings as 'vicious and cowardly' as he warned the 
gunmen: 'We're coming for you.'

England's
Facebook wall posts show a troubled, angry young man struggling to 
raise his young son and cope with the loss of his father and his 
girlfriend.

After the 
shootings, he wrote: 'People talking s*** on me for some s*** I didn't 
do... I do believer (sic) it just mite be the time to call it quits... 
if something does happen tonite be ready for another funeral later.'

Police are waiting for the results of forensic 
tests to determine scientific links between the shootings.

Police Capt. Steve Odom said in his 
30 years with the police department, he'd never seen so many shootings 
happen in such a short time.

Crime scene: William Allen, 31, was found in the yard of this funeral home many hours after he was gunned down. His wife says he was walking home from his brother's house

Walker said detectives interviewed people Friday afternoon in the neighborhoods where the shootings happened and believe a white man driving a white pickup truck may have been involved.

At least one victim said a shooter stopped his target to ask for directions before opening fire.

Allen, who was walking home from his brother's house, had narrowly avoided death once, when he was badly injured in a car crash. His family never expected his life to end violently.

'Why? Why did this happen? What was the reason? What was the motive?" his wife Jeanette, asked the World.

'He was sweet, caring... my lover. He always tried to make people laugh.'

Tulsa City Councilor Jack Henderson urged people to be cautious but not let 'some crazy, deranged person mess up their weekend.'

'There's no need to become a vigilante,' Henderson said, adding that he has been assured police are working on the case as a '24/7 round-the-clock deal.'
