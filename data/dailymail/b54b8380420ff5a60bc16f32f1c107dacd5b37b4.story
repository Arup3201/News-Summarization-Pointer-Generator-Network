A rogue monk who shunned his Buddhist vows in favor of private jets, expensive cars and Louis Vuitton luggage is now wanted by Thai police for rape.

Luang Pu Nenkham, better known as the 'jet-set monk,' gained notority when a viral video appeared on YouTube two months ago showing him accessorizing his traditional dress with golden Aviator sunglasses and a Louis Vuitton bag aboard a private jet.

Thailand's Department of Special Investigation have now uncovered a mind-boggling list of assets belonging to the 34-year old, who claimed to be the reincarnation of a respected monk who lived several decades ago, including at least 83 cars, a long list of properties and millions upon millions of dollars.

The lavish lifestyle is believed to 
have been funded by donations over the past decade, from poor supporters
 as well as rich donors.

On Wednesday, Thai authorities issued an arrest
 warrant for the monk who has now stripped of his religious leadership, 
and according to CNN, rape is among the charges he is facing.

Nenkham, who also goes by the name 
Weerapol Sukpol, also faces charges of violating Thailand's computer 
crime act by posting 'deceitful information' and having sex with a 
minor, authorities told CNN.

A
 female plaintiff claimed Nenkham had sex with her when she was just 14 
years old. She has submitted a request for a DNA test for her 11-year 
old son, Tharit Pengdit, Director General of the Department of Special 
Investigation, told the station. The results are still pending.

Nenkham's
 bank accounts are also under investigation after at least 300 million 
baht, or nearly $10 million, disappeared from the former holy man's 
accounts in recent days.

Under investigation: The video clip received complaints from Buddhists across the globe, prompting a probe into the monks' behaviour

A source told the DSI that the jet-set monk is in the United States, holed 
up at a Buddhist retreat he owns some 75 miles south of Los Angeles.

On
 Thursday, CNN went to the retreat but one resident monk said Nenkham 
had not been seen at the property in three months while a second said 
he'd been gone for a year.

In
 an effort to catch the fugitive, Thailand's DSI told CNN it has 
requested 114 financial institutions, land and transport departments to 
seize all of his assets. Authorities from the south east Asian country 
have also requested U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement revoke 
Nenkham's visa and, if they catch him, will ask U.S. authorities to 
arrest and remand him into Thai custody.

The monk provoked outrage when he was filmed carrying a designer Louis Vuitton bag while on board a private jet.

Nenkham attracted global attention when the video clip of him was posted on YouTube, with his high-flying image starkly at odds with the quiet life of reflection and meditative study synonymous with his religion.

He has been accused of being married, and having relationships with seven other women in a probe by Thailand's Department of Special Investigations.

Shocking behaviour: The allegations surrounding Pu Nenkham have shocked Thailand, which is home to the world's largest Buddhist population

According to the department, Nenkham,
 who is abbot of the Khantitham Forest Monastery in north eastern 
Thailand, is allegedly married to a woman called Yupinpraethong 
Janthawa.

He has also been 
accused by a fellow monk of being a fake, and wearing the religious 
robes despite not being entitled to do so - a criminal offense in Thailand.

Luang Pu Buddha Isara, the abbot at another monastery, filed the complaint against Nenkham  to Bangkok's Criminal Court.

The allegations surrounding Nenkham have shocked Thailand, which is home to the largest number of Buddhists in the world.

He is now being investigated by the Department of Special Investigations, and the Office of National Buddhism, which monitors the 200,000 monks in Thailand, according to the Daily Telegraph.

The investigation was launched following numerous complaints from Buddhists around the world after the two minute and 47 second long clip was posted on YouTube.

The video showed monks, one of them Nenkham, sporting fashionable mirrored shades and using wireless headphones on board the private plane.

The clip also prompted the Office of National Buddhism's 
director-general Nopparat Benjawatananun to warn the monks not to repeat the lavish behavior, and there are plans for the watchdog to begin monitoring monks across Thailand.

Nenkham
 is also the focus of a money-laundering investigation, with a police 
colonel, Pong-in Intarakhao claiming that the abbot, along with others, 
had 41 bank accounts filled with cash from public donations to his monastery, with the accounts mostly in his name.

The abbot was initially believed to be in Europe, and was been ordered to return to his home country within the next 30 days by  Mr Benjawatananun. But it is now thought he is in America.

Thailand has attempted to help 
Buddha's 2,600-year-old doctrine stand the test of time through a 
variety of means, including imposing a ban on the sale of alcohol on 
religious holidays.

The efforts, however, are sometimes tainted by the monks themselves.

Last
 year, about 300 out of 61,416 Buddhist monks and novices in Thailand 
were reprimanded - in several cases removed from the monkhood - because 
of their misconduct, ranging from alcohol consumption, having sex with 
women, to extortion.

The office also received complaints about monks driving cars, and scams and false claims of black magic uses by monks.

Mr Nopparat has said the monks 
in the video were acting 'inappropriately, not composed and not adhering
 to Buddha's teachings of simplicity and self-restraint'.

Monruedee
 Bantoengsuk, an administrative officer at Khantitham Temple in Sisaket 
province, confirmed that the monks on the private plane lived at the 
temple but refused to give details about the trip.

The
 images from the video contrasted with the abbot's message on the 
temple's homepage that read: 'The true core of those who preach Buddha's
 teachings is to not to own any objects at all'.

Mr Nopparat said: 'When
 Lord Buddha was alive, there wasn't anything like this. There were no 
cars, smart phones or cameras, so the rules were much simpler.

'While the 
monks need to keep themselves abreast of new knowledge, current events 
and technology, they are restrained to choose the appropriate tools.'

He said one way to prevent the monks from misbehaving is for followers not to spoil them with valuable objects or vices.

'In
 many cases, it was the followers who gave the monks the luxury. Some 
bought them sports cars. This is by no means necessary.'
