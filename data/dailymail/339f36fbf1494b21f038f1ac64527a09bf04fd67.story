A French politician has reacted furiously to the German Chancellor's accusations that France and Italy have not done enough to trim their budgets.

Angela Merkel's calls for the countries to make further cuts was met negatively by Jean-Luc Melenchon, who tweeted in German: 'Shut your trap, Miss Merkel! France is free!'

The former Presidential candidate added she should concern herself more with the poor people in her country, and its 'ruined equipment'.

Mr Melenchon's reaction mirrored that of his President, Francois Hollande, as he tries to claw back support from left-wing voters.

Angry: French politician, Jean-Luc Melenchon, took to his Twitter account to vent his disapproval. He wrote: 'Shut your trap, Mrs Merkel! France is free. Occupy yourself with your poor and your ruined equipment.'

The president is reportedly shying away from radical reforms to France's faltering economy demanded by Germany and Brussels.

France had pledged to bring its deficit down the EU-imposed limit of 3 per cent by 2013, but has since acknowledged that it will not reach that threshold until 2017.

Mrs Merkel has warned the two countries to carry out 'deficit-reducing measures' by March, when the European Commission will decide whether their budgets are in line with the bloc's deficit rules.

If further steps are not taken, France risks being fined by the Commission, and Italy could be placed under a disciplinary process because of its extreme levels of debt.

Mrs Merkel told her conservative party's congress that Germany was not being 'fussy' in wanting to keep to the EU's Growth and Stability Pact.

'The Commission has made clear that what has been put on the table so far is insufficient. I would agree with this,' she said.

'If, in the end, we fail to adhere to what we resolved to do in this crisis, then we would gamble away confidence. And that would not be good for Europe.' 

In a television appearance shortly after he remarks were made public, France's Prime Minister announced the country was losing its enthusiasm for financial reform imposed by Brussels.

A senior Italian official also hit back at Mrs Merkel - describing her comments as 'regrettable'. 

Sandro Gozi, Italy's undersecretary for EU affairs said: 'The Italian government has never permitted itself to hand out marks to a European Union member countries and we ask Germany for the same respect.

'Maybe Chancellor Merkel should focus on Germany's domestic demand, on its lack of investments, or on its balance-of-payments imbalances.

'It would be an important contribution that Europe has been waiting on Berlin to make for a long time and which so far has not happened.'

Last year, the European Commission won new powers to assess national budgets to ensure they are in line with EU agreements. But sanctioning countries for failing to meet budget plans remains a highly sensitive issue.

Chancellor Merkel's spokesman confirmed on Monday that she had to interrupt a television interview after suffering a 'dizzy spell', but carried on to finish it.

She was in the middle of an interview with ZDF television, one of a series of media interviews before her party's congress meeting, when she suddenly felt unwell.  

Mrs Merkel, 60, who's in her 10th year as chancellor, later took part in the annual get-together with the media after finishing her series of interviews.

Mrs Merkel was meanwhile resoundingly elected to a new two-year term as leader of her Christian Democratic Union today. Some 96.7 of delegates at the convention voted for the 60-year-old.
