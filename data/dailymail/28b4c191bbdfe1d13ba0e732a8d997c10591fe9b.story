If seeing GIFs across the web isn’t enough to satisfy your need for the short moving clips, you can now buy a machine that plays them without the need for electricity or an internet connection.

Called a Giphoscope, the custom-built machine turns GIFs, short video clips and vines into a series of images that are printed onto the flip pages of the device.

Users crank the handle on the side of the Giphoscope to move these pages and the images appear to play, similar to images in a flip book.

Brooklyn-based designers Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx recently created a company called Gifpop!

It aims to print animated GIFs onto lenticular film.

Lenticular film, which shows pitted, prismatic plastic pictures, used to be popular in childhood stickers and notebooks.

The image in lenticular film appears to move as the viewer moves, with its animation looping through a short number of frames.

The technology dates back to World War II.

It is the brainchild of Italian designers Marco Calabrese and Alessandro Scali, and the idea is based on the 19th century Mutoscope players. 

The Mutoscope was an early motion picture device developed by Herman Casler in 1894.

It worked in a similar way to flip books and was seen as the follow-up to Thomas Edison’s Kinetoscope.

On the Mutoscope, images were slotted into flexible see-through cards and rotated around a central wheel. 

The machines were traditionally built at eye height so the average person could stand and watch the images, and the Giphscope is a modern-day, desktop version of this.

Each Giphoscope is custom-built in Italy and costs €300 (£251) to make, plus shipping costs.  

The images are rotated around an aluminium core fitted to a wooden base that can be stuck to any surface using glue pads.The crank turns using ball bearings. 

Once a customer has sent a digital copy of their GIF the designers match the colour of the metal, handle and base to complement the images.

Each model takes between seven and ten days to make.

It isn't the first time a company has created an offline version of the popular moving images.

Brooklyn-based designers Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx recently created a company called Gifpop!

It aims to print animated GIFs onto lenticular film.

Lenticular film, which shows pitted, prismatic plastic pictures, used to be popular in childhood stickers and notebooks.

The image in lenticular film appears to move as the viewer moves, with its animation looping through a short number of frames.

The technology dates back to World War II.

Hwang and Binx launched their Kickstarter campaign for Gifpop! with the aim of making this a reality. The project was almost immediately funded.

As well as the custom GIFs, the designers hope to be running off limited batches of works by three GIF artists, including Mr Div, 89-A, and Davidope.
