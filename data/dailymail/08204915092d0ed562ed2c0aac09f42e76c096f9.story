They lost the World Cup Final by the narrowest of margins - on penalty kicks - but the U.S. women's soccer squad returned home to a heroines' welcome.

Thousands greeted the players in mid-Manhattan in New York yesterday, about 24 hours after they had been defeated by Japan on spot kicks after the scores were locked at 2-2 following extra time at the Commerzbank Arena, Frankfurt.

And earlier today, while being interviewed on the Today programme, Abby Wambach said that if they couldn't win, then it was just that the Japanese, who have suffered so much since the earthquake and tsunami struck in March, were victorious.

The 31-year-old, who plays for 
MagicJack in America, said this morning: 'Maybe it is best for the 
Japanese people [to win]. It's obviously hard for us as we wanted to 
win.

'But if our sacrifice in not winning 
is going to uplift an entire nation, in terms of what they have gone 
through in the last few months with the disasters, then we are proud to 
have been on the other side of the field.'

Stars and 
stripes flags were waved yesterday in New York and players kindly posed for photographs with 
the fans, despite the heartache they must have been feeling from the 
dramatic loss in Germany on Sunday.

'I didn't expect to pull into Times Square and have this kind of reception,' midfielder Heather O'Reilly said while forward Miss Wambach called the scene 'really humbling' and added: 'Truthfully, it brought my spirits up more than anything.

'I'm so disappointed for myself, our team and our country, because I felt we had it.'

When she was asked about her future the veteran forward said: 'I just want to spend some time with my team-mates. This has been an emotional roller-coaster.'

Similarly Carli Lloyd said: 'It's just unfortunate, just a bummer. But there's another World Cup in four years.'

Alex
Morgan had given America the initial lead in the 68th minute, while Aya
Miyama scored Japan's first goal of the game 10 mintes before the end 
of normal time.

Miss 
Wambach then scored for the U.S. in the 104th minute and, with just 
three minutes remaining, Homare Sawa netted another equaliser for the 
Japanese.

Japan then won the resulting penalty shoot-out 3-1 to claim their first such title.

Incredibly, the final - in which 
Japan twice came from behind to win - sparked the most tweets per second
ever on popular social networking site Twitter.

The figure, 7,196, was more than the marriage of Prince William and Kate Middleton and news of the death of Osama bin Laden.

In
addition, the match ranked second on the all-time list most watched 
women's soccer games in America, with some 7.4 per cent of households 
tuning in.

Although 
the post-World Cup euphoria will continue for some time - Miss Wambach 
and goalkeeper Hope Solo, who has become something of a sex symbol 
though her performances in the tournament, are scheduled to appear on 
Late Show with David Letterman tonight - the players are looking ahead 
to next summer's Olympics in London.

Miss Wambach, who missed the 2008 
Olympics with a broken leg, said: 'As soon as I got into the locker 
room, I started to think about 2012.'

Captain Christie Rampone, team 
captain and veteran of the World Cup winning 1999 team, also indicated 
that she would like to play in the Olympics, though conceded that she 
would not be likely to play in another World Cup.

The
veteran, accompanied by her two daughters who were wearing 
star-spangled skirts, said: 'It was the biggest event I've been part of 
for 14 years on the team. Once I'm done, I'll have to find another 
career.'

The 29-year-old goalkeeper Miss Hope said she continues to replay the final over in her head and 'I'll be doing that for quite some time' before she added: 'Part of me wanted to make sense of it all and say it was all Japan's fate.'

Meanwhile in Tokyo thousands of joyous, flag-waving fans greeted the Japan women's soccer team as the players arrived home yesterday morning.

Two fire trucks shot out celebratory arches of water over the team's plane as it approached the terminal at Tokyo's Narita Airport.

Throngs of fans wearing the team's dark blue colours greeted the players as they made their way into the terminal.

A nation reeling from months of tragedy, following the March earthquake, tsunami and the resulting nuclear fall-out at the Fukishima plant, has been united in joyous celebration after its team became the first from Asia to win the biggest prize in women's soccer.

Prime Minister Naoto Kan called the victory the 'greatest gift' to the nation, especially to the residents of the northeast coast most devastated by the March 11 natural disasters.

The twin disasters left nearly 23,000 people dead or missing and caused partial meltdowns at a nuclear power plant that added to the tragedy.

Defense Minister Toshimi Kitazawa said the victory will encourage those working to help Japan bounce back.

'The team showed great perseverance and sent a good message toward recovery from the major disaster,' Mr Kitazawa said.
