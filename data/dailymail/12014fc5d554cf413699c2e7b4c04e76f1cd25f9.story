A record number of convicts escaped from secure mental health units in the last three years, with a 35 per cent rise recorded.

Last year, 153 mentally disordered offenders - including dangerous convicted murderers - escaped from prisons and four who escaped before 2010 are still at large today.

Tory MP Philip Davies, who has campaigned against Britain's 'soft-touch' system and an outspoken critic of judges, said far more needed to be done to protect the public.

He told MailOnline: 'The public are right to be concerned and clearly the system is not good enough. It is broken and needs fixing. Some of these people are extremely dangerous and should be in secure accommodation, but that accommodation is not particularly secure at the moment.

'It's the equivalent of an open prison, where people are given the opportunity to simply walk out of the grounds and that cannot be acceptable, but too often that's happening.

'Protecting the public should be the main priority, but in many cases, it is important to protect these criminals from themselves.

'They should never be given the opportunity to repeat their crimes they have been convicted of. The system is too lax and the rights of criminals seems to come above the safety of the public.'

Adam Pemberton, Assistant Chief Executive of Victim Support, told MailOnline: 'Victims need to be able to have confidence that dangerous offenders will be held securely.

'Without this, it can be difficult for people to move on from crime. If any dangerous offenders do escape or abscond, it is essential that the authorities keep victims informed.'

The number of people breaking out of mental health units from 113 in 2010, to 120 in 2011, to 146 in 2012, to a record 153 last year, the Sun said.

So-called restricted patients are offenders with mental disorders who have been sent to secure or medium-secure hospitals for help. 

In recent years, a number of convicted killers have managed to escape from secure units. 

In July 2013, Ian McLean, who is serving a life sentence for repeatedly stabbing his girlfriend, was able to flee abroad after he walked out of a mental health facility in Littlemore, Oxfordshire and boarded a Eurostar train to Belgium.

He spent more than an hour in Brussels before anyone noticed he was missing.  

The career criminal then travelled to Berlin before moving on to the Polish seaside resort of Kolobrzeg.

Abscond - where patient is given authorised leave but don't come back at the scheduled time

Escape - where patient leaves the premises without being granted leave 

2010 - 113 (106 absconds, 7 escapes)

2011 - 120 (104 absconds, 16 escapes)

2012 - 146 (135 absconds, 11 escapes)

2013 - 153 (142 absconds, 11 escapes)  

His escape forced police officers to place Michelle Storer – the ex-lover he stabbed – in protective custody.

McLean was finally arrested in Kolobrzeg, 300 miles north-west of Warsaw, after nine days on the run.

The next month, Daniel Rosenthal,  who murdered his mother and chopped her body into pieces with a hacksaw, escaped for a day from a mental health unit in Totton, on the edge of the New Forest in Hampshire.

Rosenthal, dubbed the 'mad scientist', who has paranoid schizophrenia, escaped when he went on a 'routine, unsupervised walk' around the gardens of the hospital.  

In October 2013, Lerone Boye, 28 — who was convicted of stabbing a teenager to death at a club — went missing from a mental health unit. He was eventually found in January hiding under a bed in Chigwell, Essex. 

When asked whether his escape was worth it, he replied: 'Best three months of my life.'

In June this year, Samuel Lee, who was jailed for life for subjecting a disabled woman to an hour-long rape ordeal, absconded from  the same place, the John Howard mental hospital in Hackney. 

He had previously been jailed for manslaughter in 1989, for stabbing a man to death.  

He was found in the Sussex seaside town of Eastbourne four days later.

The Department of Health  said: He said: 'It's vital mental health units have robust security processes in place to stop patients who have committed a serious offence from escaping.'
