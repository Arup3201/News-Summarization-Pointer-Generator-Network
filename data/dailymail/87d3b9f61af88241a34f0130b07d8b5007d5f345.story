Trainer Mick Channon is targeting the Prix Marcel Boussac for Malabar after witnessing his premier filly finish a close fourth on her Group One debut at The Curragh on Sunday.

The daughter of Raven’s Pass was only a length and a quarter behind winner Cursory Glance in the Moyglare Stakes and her handler believes she is capable of making her mark in Paris on l’Arc de Triomphe day early next month.

Channon said:'We will have to see how Malabar come out of Sunday’s race of course, but if she is well then the Marcel Boussac on Arc day (October 5) looks the perfect race for her.

'She ran a career best in Ireland and made up over a length on Cursory Glance on their running at Ascot despite the winner getting first run on us.

'We had to go through horses from quite a long way back, but that was just the way the race panned out and we were very pleased with the run.

'Hopefully, she is in similar shape come the end of the month, but if she isn’t we could wrap her up for the year as she is a very good filly and one for next year.' As reported in Monday's Daily Mail, the Queen’s Estimate will not make the trip to Australia to contest the Emirates Melbourne Cup in November.

John Warren, Royal bloodstock and racing advisor, confirmed in a statement that the recent Doncaster Cup winner will have one more outing at Ascot or Longchamp before being retired to embark on a career as a broodmare.
