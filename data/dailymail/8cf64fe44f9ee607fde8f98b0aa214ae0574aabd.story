Victim: United Airlines flight attendant DeCarol Deloney-Cain, pictured, was murdered and dumped in the trunk of her own car where she was discovered on Monday

A woman whose body was found in a car trunk in Gary, Illinois, has been identified as a missing United Airlines flight attendant.

Lake County Deputy Coroner George Deliopoulos said 54-year-old DeCarol Deloney-Cain of Crown Point was positively identified through serial numbers on her breast implants.

An autopsy determined she died from blunt force trauma to her head and multiple stab wounds to her chest and the manner of death was ruled a homicide.

The mother of two adult sons and a teenage daughter was in the midst of a divorce that was due to be finalized August 14, court documents show.

Her body was found Monday wrapped in material in the trunk of her car in a wooded area in Gary, 12 miles north of Crown Point.

Deliopoulos said Gary detectives and Lake County crime scene investigators executed a search warrant and retrieved evidence at the victim's home on Wednesday. Authorities have not identified any suspects.

Deloney-Cain's son, Blake Deloney, told The Times that United Airlines contacted him Sunday when his mother didn't report for work.

An airline spokesman says Deloney-Cain served as a flight attendant on international flights out of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. She'd worked for the airline for 28 years.

The air hostess was often gone for days at a time because of her job.

As such, her family thought nothing of her absence, the Chicago-Sun Times reported.

Officers discovered the woman's body in her car trunk after responding to a call about a vehicle left on a gravel road.

There were numerous stab wounds and blunt force trauma to the head.

Her brother Todd Deloney said no one had heard from his sister since July 3, but no one suspected anything because the she often flew international flights.

He told the Sun Times that Deloney-Cain had lived in Crown Point since 2005.

'She was a very vivacious woman,' Deloney said. 'She had a quest for traveling. She was very devoted to her children and her immediate family. When you met the girl you were never a stranger.'
