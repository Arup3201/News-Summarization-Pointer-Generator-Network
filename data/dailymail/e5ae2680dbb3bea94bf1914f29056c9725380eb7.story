The horrific gas explosion in East Village on Thursday brought Manhattan to a standstill and left a lingering fear about the city-wide, never-ending building works. 

Photographer Nathan Blaney, who captured the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, was sat feet away in Bull McCabe's bar when the now-destroyed sushi restaurant exploded.

Sprinting out the door, he grabbed his camera and documented the scene in a poignant collection of images.

This is the moment emergency services rushed to a gas explosion which blew three East Village buildings into oblivion on Thursday

Poignant: Photographer Nathan Blaney, who captured the 9/11 attacks, was around the corner and documented the scene

Fears: A residents kneels and anxiously clings to an escape ladder as the buildings around her disintegrate

Workers from Con Edison reportedly visited the building for about 45 minutes. After they left, the owner of the sushi bar smelled gas

Onlookers gather and tend to people on the ground as the entire front of the restaurant collapsed onto the sidewalk

Like his shots of the Twin Towers in 2001, the black smoke pouring out of the East Village cafes and apartments is eerily still in Blaney's photographs.

People are seen walking past covering their faces as an acrid smell permeated the streets.

Helping everybody out: An off-duty firefighter climbs down the escape route of building 121 after rushing to help. The building is one of three that is now destroyed

Ripped apart: The front of the building came clean off, exposing bedrooms and offices which later crumbled

Workers can be seen climbing out of the restaurant as the smell of gas lingered

The entire block has been shut off by authorities since Thursday as teams worked around the clock to wade through the rubble

New Yorkers covered their faces as an acrid smell permeated the streets as far as five blocks away

Emergency: Eventually, the fire service blocked off the route and officers flooded the area to search for trapped victims

Panic: In the first few minutes, people were shouting 'bomb' and NYPD detectives were scrambling to handle the situation

The smoke and fire continued to pour into the sky until the early hours of Friday morning

'In those first moments, people were saying "bomb" rather than "gas explosion" but either way, I had a sense of what images I was looking for. As the scene evolved, I tried to document the events as they unfolded', Blaney told Mashable.

He said that, since 9/11, he is never without a camera. 

'I was happy that those who were injured were getting plenty of immediate appropriate attention, and I heard at least one person identify themselves as a doctor, so although conflicted, I was okay with sticking to my role in documenting the event,' he told the site.

On Sunday night, authorities identified one of the bodies as 23-year-old Nicholas Figueroa, a former model for Hollister who had been on a second date at Sushi Park with his Bowlmor Lanes colleague. 

His date, 22-year-old Theresa Galarza, was pictured at the scene being fitted with a neck brace after she was reportedly hurled across the street by the force of the suspected gas explosion. 

Fearful: People on the ground shout up to a woman who stands, looking terrified, about 20 feet above the ground

Helped down: A man climbs up the ladder, which appears to be dented by the blast, to help the woman

Destroyed: Bikes, chairs, walls, cabinets, clothes and curtains lie in a slump on the ground

Lingering smoke: Like his 9/11 photographs, Blaney's images are poignant and still

Crest-fallen: Pedestrians bow their heads in shock walking past the wreckage

Disbelief: Craning their necks, the crowd appears still as they survey the building

A man sits on the tarmac, shoeless, looking exhausted and staring into the distant as the impact sets in 

She was later admitted to Bellevue Hospital with a broken nose and punctured lung. 

It is believed Figueroa was standing with 26-year-old busboy Moises Locon when the building exploded.

Locon has yet to be accounted for as officers work to identify the second body found among the debris. 

Four of the 22 people injured remain in critical condition. Eighteen of the 22 suffered non-life threatening injuries.

Workers from Con Edison reportedly visited the building (121) for about 45 minutes, the Times reports. After the workers left, the owner of the sushi bar reported smelling gas to the building's owner.

The explosion occurred 15 minutes later as workers went to look in the basement.
