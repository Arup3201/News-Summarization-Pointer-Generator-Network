A manhunt has been launched four 'black widows' planning to suicide bomb the Winter Olympics.

Officers are scouring Sochi, where the games begin next month, with wanted posters featuring Ruzan Ibragimova, 22, whose husband was killed by Russian security forces last year.

The suspect, from Dagestan - a city notorious for its use of 'black widows' - is believed to be plotting an attack with three other women.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Wanted: Ruzan Ibragimov, whose husband was an Islamist militant killed by Russian security forces last year, is one of the 'black widow' terrorists who may be in Sochi plotting an attack

Changeable: Islamists in Caucasus are notorious for their use of 'black widows' as they can use make-up to change their appearance and usually go unsuspected. Ibramigova, pictured, is described as having a limp and a scar

She is described as having a limp, a scar on her cheek, and that her left arm does not bend at the elbow.

The posters say that Russian authorities believe she left Dagestan, a Russian republic in the Caucasus, earlier this month, and may be headed for the Olympic city.

The hunt follows the release of a video showing two young men who are believed to have been bombers in the December 2013 Volgograd attacks.

Posted by group Ansar al Sunah on a militant Chechen site, the two men warned that as long as President Vladimir Putin occupies the North Caucasus region near Sochi, Russians and Olympic visitors alike will not be safe, ABC News reported.

'We'll have a surprise package for you,' one of the men said in the video, according to the ABC report. 'And those tourists that will come to you, for them, too, we have a surprise. If it happens [the Olympics], we'll have a surprise for you.

The two men in the video, seen here, warn their 'surprise package' will be 'for all the Muslim blood that is shed every day around the world, be it in Afghanistan, Somalia, Syria, all around the world'

U.S. officials are investigating whether the two men in the video, seen here, are tied to the December Volgograd bombings

'This is for all the Muslim blood that is shed every day around the world, be it in Afghanistan, Somalia, Syria, all around the world. This will be our revenge.'

U.S. authorities are examining the video -- but an official told USA Today that 'there was no definitive evidence' to indicate whether the men shown in the video were actually tied to the Volgograd bombings, which killed more than 30 people.

Russian and US authorities are also thought to be looking for as many as four 'black widows' who they believe may attempt to carry out terrorist attacks close to the Winter Olympics.

Militant groups in the Caucasus have 
been known to use 'black widows' because they can easily alter their 
appearance with makeup and different clothes, and do not fit the typical
 profile of an Islamist bomber.

Russian president Vladimir Putin, seen in this file photo, told ABC that Russia will do 'whatever it takes' to make the Sochi Games secure. An expected 80,000 troops are to be on guard

Officials are also allegedly concerned that Russians are not fully cooperating with American security, according to ABC.

Other extremists linked to Muslim separatist leader Doku Umarov have threatened to upset the Games, according to The New York Times.Â 

U.S. lawmakers are worried about security at the upcoming Winter Olympics. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich) told CNN's Candy Crowley he was 'very concerned.'

The U.S., meanwhile, reportedly has only sent 40 FBI personnel to Russia -- compared to more than 100 staff sent to previous Games held in China, Italy and Greece, according to The Wall Street Journal.
