Mario Balotelli has praised Liverpool fans for their support and promised them that better performances and goals are set to come.

The 24-year-old took to Instagram on Saturday to thank the Anfield faithful for the banner that they have displayed in his honour, and assure them that he will repay them soon.

The banner, written in Balotelli's native Italian tongue, translates into English as 'I have nothing to declare except my genius'.

And Balotelli replied to the gesture on Instagram on Saturday, saying: 'I have nothing to declare except my genius? Wow thanks to whoever did this. 

'I know all of you expect more from me .. More goals especially and more "genius" but give me time and I'll show it's true.'

Balotelli has had a somewhat indifferent start to his Liverpool career, scoring just once in his eight appearances in all competitions so far.

Balotelli has just one goal in eight games for Liverpool so far

That sole goal was the opener in their 2-1 Champions League victory over Bulgarian minnows Ludogerets last month.

His lack of form has also seen him left out of the last two Italy boss Antonio Conte's last two squads.
