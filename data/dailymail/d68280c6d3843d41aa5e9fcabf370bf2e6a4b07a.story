Fears have been raised that a batch of supermarket pasta could be contaminated with weevils after two customers discovered infestations.

Mary Randall, 60, was about to start cooking dinner when she found a swarm of the black beetles inside her unopened bag of fusilli pasta.

Mrs Randall, from Ringwood, Hampshire, purchased the 500g bag from a branch of Tesco in Salisbury on Saturday.

She is the second person in two weeks to find her 'Cook Italian' pasta bag from a Tesco store infested

She is the second person in as many weeks to have discovered a swarm of bugs in the Cook Italian pasta packets.

The first infested bag was found by Hayley O’Shea, 39, who purchased a 500g bag from a Tesco store around 30 miles from Salisbury in Bournemouth, Dorset, on 12 October.

She was cooking a tuna pasta bake for her two young children when she made the discovery.

There are now concerns that other packets on the shelves of the supermarket giant could contain the creatures.

Mrs Randall, who suffers from ME, has not yet complained to Tesco or returned the pasta because of her ill-health.

She said: 'I’m not the first person this has happened to, but I want to make sure other people are aware this is happening because it’s really disgusting.

'The whole packet of pasta was alive with hundreds of horrible black bugs crawling around, some of the creatures are half an inch long, so they are very noticeable.

'I have no idea how they got inside, but it really makes my skin crawl.

She added: 'I’m not impressed that they have managed to get through the packaging.'

Mrs O'Shea, an account manager at a marketing company, found the weevils in her bag two weeks ago

Mrs O’Shea, an account manager at a marketing company, said: 'If there are eggs in the pasta hatching into live insects there could be more packets out there like this.

'There could be more people out there finding weevils in their pasta - I knew I couldn’t have been the only one.

'Tesco gave me my money back but that’s not what I wanted. I wanted them to look into it.'

A weevil is a type of beetle which is usually less than six millimetres (0.24 in) long.

There
are more than 60,000 species in several families and can often be 
found  in dry foods including nuts and seeds, cereal and grain products,
such as pancake mix.

In the domestic setting, they are most likely to be found when a bag of flour is opened.

Their presence is often indicated by the granules of the infested item sticking together in strings, as if caught in a cobweb.

Despite both women discovering their pasta bags to be infested with the insects, food manufacturer Cook Italian does not believe the whole batch is contaminated.

'There is not a contaminated batch of pasta, and weevils are not a big issue in the food industry,' a spokesman said.

'Most products that are dried like flour, rice and pasta, have tiny holes in the packets that we cannot see, otherwise moisture cannot escape and you would have soggy food.

'Weevils can come from any country and can even find their way into totally sealed food bags.

'They cannot survive the temperature at which our pasta dough is created, and we of course carry out frequent and extensive checks and control procedures.'

They added: 'We are completely 
confident that they have not originated at source, but have come into 
contact with the pasta bag after it left the production unit.

'If we had an infestation, we would expect to see weevils in hundreds of bags, including our retained control samples.'

A
Tesco spokesman said of the second discovery: 'As soon as the item is 
returned to store we will conduct a thorough investigation with the 
supplier.

'We will keep the customer updated with the findings.'
