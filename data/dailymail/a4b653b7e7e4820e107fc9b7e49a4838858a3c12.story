Romanian crime syndicates are flooding London with hundreds of pickpockets, prostitutes and beggars ahead of the Olympics.

Coachloads of penniless migrants are arriving in the capital every day, many already armed with maps directing them to the best patches, which they have been ordered to defend from rivals.

Council workers are already having to clear around 60 Romanian nationals sleeping rough on the streets around Marble Arch and Oxford Street every night and they fear the situation is getting worse.

Police recently discovered 50 women believed to have been trafficked into the area to work as prostitutes and arrested four female beggars using babies as young as three weeks old.

Westminster crime reduction officer Claire Hardy said the foreign crooks were being allocated patches prior to leaving their country.

She told the Daily Express: 'We suspect that we may be witnessing the first pro-active entrepreneurial endeavours by organised criminal enterprise ahead of the Olympics.'

Police have seen a steady increase in the activity of Romanian criminal syndicates since the country joined the EU in 2007.

The tightly knit gangs are believed to be behind nine in ten cashpoint robberies in the capital netting over £30million a year.

Much of the money is funneled back into Romania where gangsters can live a life of luxury on their criminal profits.

Nickie Aiken, Westminster Council’s cabinet member for community protection, said officials were struggling to cope with the increasing numbers of migrants arriving by the day.

She told the paper: 'We have always had an issue with eastern Europeans coming here. But the last three weeks have seen them coming in an intensity we have never witnessed before.

'We haven’t got the resources to deal with this. We give them tickets back to Romania but it’s like a revolving door.

'They have the right to enter the country. They could stop in Germany or France but they come here because we have the reputation of providing benefits and accommodation.

'They are conned into coming here with the promise of a better future, but quickly end up jobless and homeless.

'This is being systematically organised from Romania and those running this cynical racket are the only ones who profit from it.'
