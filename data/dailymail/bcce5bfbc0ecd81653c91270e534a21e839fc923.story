In Rio, they smile - while New Yorkers will tilt their head to capture their best angle.

A new study into the science of the selfie has revealed how different cities take snaps of themselves.

Researchers analysed 656,000 Instagram pics from New York, Moscow, Berlin, Bangkok, and Sao Paulo to come to their conclusions.

 • Women take more selfies than men.

• Women strike more extreme poses in selfies (especially in São Paulo).

• The younger a person is, the more likely he or she is to take selfies. Selfie takers skew youngest in Bangkok (21), and oldest in New York City (25.3).

• People are happiest in Bangkok and São Paulo, and more miserable in Moscow.

Once they had their 656,000 Instagram photos from New York, Bangkok, Moscow, Sao Paolo, and Berlin taken between December 4 and December 12, 2013, the team fed the photos to workers hired through Amazon's Mechanical Turk marketplace.

They identified which of these photos were selfies, and made best guesses as to the age and gender of the person who took them, before analysing the images.

'People take less selfies than often assumed,' the project's site claimed.

'Depending on the city, only 3-5% of images we analysed were actually selfies.'

However, they found that everywhere in the world, it was females taking selfies.

'In every city we analyzed, there are significantly more women selfies than men selfies (from 1.3 times as many in Bangkok to 1.9 times more in Berlin).

'Moscow is a strong outlier - here, we have 4.6 times more female than male selfies!'

Each city, the researchers say, has its own selfie style.

Mood analysis revealed that you can find lots of smiling faces in Bangkok (0.68 average smile score) and Sao Paulo (0.64). People taking selfies in Moscow smile the least (only 0.53 on the smile score scale).

Women's selfies show more expressive poses; for instance, the average amount of head tilt is 150% higher than for men: (12.3° vs. 8.2°). Sao Paulo is most extreme - there, the average head tilt for females is 16.9°

The females of New York, meanwhile, appear to prefer the subtle head turn (just a hint of profile) over the dramatic ear-to-shoulder head tilt favoured in Brazil.

The team also found just 4% of instagram pictures were selfies

'Women strike more extreme poses, especially in Sao Paulo,' the team reported.

Alise Tifentale ofThe City University of New York (CUNY), who worked on the project said selfies are changing the way we communicate.

'Selfies make us aware about a particular method of self-fashioning and communication  that is historically time-specific in the sense that it could materialize only in the moment when  several technologies have reached a certain level of development and accessibility.

'Since November 19, 2013 when Oxford Dictionaries announced selfie as 'the international Word of the Year'  this hybrid phenomenon of vernacular photography and social media has created quite a bit of media hype.

The Selfiecity project also created these collages of selfies to promote the project, which they say was inspired by selfie being named as 'word of the year' in 2013
