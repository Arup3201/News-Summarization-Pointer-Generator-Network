The Tory MEPs were entertained by the world-renowned cellist Ana Rucner

Tory MEPs were accused of hypocrisy last night after spending tens of thousands of pounds of  taxpayers’ money on a week-long junket to the popular holiday destination of Croatia.

It comes after they campaigned  to cut wasteful spending by the EU in last month’s European elections.

Fourteen Tory MEPs – some accompanied by spouses – spent an estimated £30,000 on flights, rooms at a five-star hotel and sumptuous local cuisine.

The group even included two politicians who lost their seats in last month’s European elections.

Astonishingly, the trip took place before the new European Parliament has even met following the elections.

Last night, UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: ‘Tory MEPs are dripping with hypocrisy. They may criticise the EU’s waste of taxpayers’ money by press release, but in reality no one does it better than they do. It’s outrageous.’

Officially, the purpose of the trip was to hold ‘study days’ with fellow right-of-centre MEPs in the European Conservatives and Reformists group to develop priorities for reforming the EU.

The Tory contingent included its former European Parliament leader Martin Callanan and Marta Andreasen, both of whom lost their seats last month.

North West MEP Sir Robert Atkins, 68, who is standing down at the end of this month, was also on the trip.

Syed Kamall, 47, the Tories’ new Brussels group leader and head of the ECR, was also present.

Fellow MEPs Timothy Kirkhope, Geoffrey Van Orden and Ashley Fox all took their wives, while Anthea McIntyre attended with her husband.

Other MEPs on the trip were David Campbell Bannerman, Jacqueline Foster, Richard Ashworth, Emma McClarkin, Ian Duncan and Vicky Ford.

An estimated six Tory group officials were also present.

The five-day jaunt started on Monday when the politicians checked into the Hilton Imperial hotel in Dubrovnik, where rooms cost £200 a night.

One of the highlights was a trip to the pretty island of Korcula. Six of  the MEPs were ferried there by privately hired boats, before enjoying lunch at a hotel.

Earlier in the week, the MEPs dined at a restaurant outside Dubrovnik where they were served champagne, before tucking into £19.50 meat platters and £23 home-smoked trout.

And on Tuesday, the MEPs – who earn around £80,000 a year, £13,000 more than their Westminster counterparts – enjoyed a private performance by internationally acclaimed cellist Ana Rucner.

Asked by The Mail on Sunday to justify the trip, the Tories said they had been invited there by fellow ECR MEP Ruza Tomasic who has a home on Korcula, and insisted it was a working trip.

But when challenged some refused to discuss it, while others were prepared to defend the trip.

East of England MEP Mr Campbell Bannerman, 54, said: ‘It’s very important to cement the ECR group and the UK delegation.’

But challenged that the Korcula day trip looked like a holiday, he admitted: ‘There’s an element of that.’

Miss Andreasen, 59, a former UKIP MEP, said that it was a ‘sign  of friendliness’ to organise the event away from Brussels.

But Vicky Ford and fellow East of England MEP Geoffrey Van Orden, refused to discuss the trip.

A Tory ECR spokesman defended the visit, saying the MEPs had been ‘able to gain a better understanding of the political situation in Croatia, including issues that affect the UK’.

The spokesman said the MEPs’ accommodation was funded by their daily £243 allowance when on official business. He insisted that hotel and travel costs for spouses ‘were paid by spouses themselves’.

And he defended defeated MEPs being present, saying they remained members of the Parliament until it reconvened next month.
