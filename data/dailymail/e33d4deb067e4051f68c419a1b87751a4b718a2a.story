Lord Sugar can't admit when he has 'done something wrong' and won't ever be seen to back down, a tribunal was told yesterday.

The claim was made during the employment tribunal of former Apprentice winner Stella English, 34, who is suing him for constructive dismissal.

Ms English, from Whitstable, 
Kent, claims she was treated as an 'overpaid lackey' after being handed a
Â£100,000 contract for winning series six of the BBC1 show in 2010.

Lord Sugar told the East 
London Tribunal Centre he has no case to answer but Ms English's lawyer 
told the court he just can't admit he may be in the wrong.

Philippa Jackson, representing Ms 
English, said: 'He's not going to be seen to be backing down.

'He doesn't think much of employees running off and complaining - they should get on with it.

'What's more, he doesn't like it when people cross him. That became evident in the course of his evidence.

'He doesn't even attempt to countenance he might have committed a breach and done something wrong.'

She said as Ms English was Lord Sugar's 
apprentice, she had the right to expect 'a degree of mentoring' during 
her time working for him - something she alleges was lacking.

For there to be 'a relationship of trust
and confidence' between an employer and employee, both sides must 
consider the job to be 'a genuine occupation', added Ms Jackson.

Addressing the fact that Ms English did 
not make any complaints about the way she claims to have been treated 
before resigning, Ms Jackson said: 'She was clearly in a difficult 
situation. She was overpaid. She's come into an established company in 
very unusual circumstances.

'All that is relevant in understanding why she did not raise any issues.'

Row: Lord Alan Sugar, pictured left, said 
that his former employee, pictured right, was is a 'headline-grabber' deliberately 'courting' the media to try and ruin his reputation

Lord Sugar met his former employee Stella English (second from left, front row) on the series that was aired in 2010 - but now she is suing him

But Lord Sugars' representative Seamus Sweeney argued Ms English was 'courting' the media to ruin the tycoon's reputation and compared her to the wife of Chris Huhne.

He said: 'The claimant has, in the 
eyes of Lord Sugar, deliberately courted the media with a view of 
damaging his reputation.'

He told how Ms English had 'sold her 
story' to the press several times and accused her of being a 'headline-grabber', deliberately sensationalising aspects of her 
evidence.

Referring to yesterday's sentencing of
former Lib Dem cabinet member Chris Huhne, Mr Sweeney said Lord Justice
Sweeney - who is no relation to him - described how Vicky Pryce using 
the media as a weapon.

He told the tribunal the same was true
of Ms English, adding: 'Using the media, in this case, was a weapon of 
choice... It was a first weapon of choice.

'On the contrary, Lord Sugar has maintained his position, his dignity, until he comes here.

'He can be forgiven in these circumstances for reacting passionately in his cross-examination because he feels wronged.'

The hearing has finished and the tribunal will make its decision within a month.

If there is to be a remedy hearing, depending on the verdict, it will take place on April 22.

Lord Sugar did not comment as he left the hearing in his Rolls- Royce, which has a personalised number plate.
