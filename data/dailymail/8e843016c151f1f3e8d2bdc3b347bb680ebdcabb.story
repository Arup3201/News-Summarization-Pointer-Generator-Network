It is the game which, ultimately, could define the success or otherwise of Martin O’Neill and Roy Keane’s expensive Republic of Ireland tenure. 

Installed amid much fanfare 18 months ago, £1million-per-year O’Neill and his assistant Keane, with a £600,000 salary, were given a remit of qualification for Euro 2016, a task made easier by the expansion to a 24-team format. 

Defeat against Poland at the Aviva Stadium on Sunday evening, however, would all but end hope of automatic progression to the finals in France, leaving Ireland to do battle with Scotland for the play-off berth. The mood here is not optimistic.

An inquest, you feel, awaits O’Neill and his regime should they fail to beat the group leaders. One newspaper described their manager as ‘bookish and vaguely befuddled’, and noted the ‘carnage’ which follows Keane. 

There has been a definite effort to play down the chaos around Keane this week and the No 2 gave an untypically subdued and low-key performance in front of the press. O’Neill ignored the opinion pieces which have called into question his impact since he arrived and kept all talk to football. 

He said: ‘The importance of the occasion should not be missed. Defeat would be a big dent in our hopes of automatic qualification. It might not decide everything, but it is very significant. We have to try to win. 

If the Republic of Ireland fail to beat Poland, their hopes of automatic qualification will be all but over

‘I’ve said all along that the home games will shape our destiny. This is the first of that group. We have to make them count. 

‘We can change all of that (negative talk) with one result and one fantastic performance. We will not get very far with a pessimistic approach and I’m not overly concerned with what people say before the game. 

‘We have given ourselves a chance (of qualification) but we will have to be right on top of our game to win this match.’ 

One criticism of O’Neill is that he does not know his preferred XI or, indeed, formation. He said this week that players could win a starting place should they impress at their coastal training base in Malahide.

One player not guaranteed to start is captain Robbie Keane. He was dropped for the morale-shattering 1-0 defeat in Scotland in November. The LA Galaxy striker, 34, said: ‘That’s up to the manager (if I play). 

‘I’ll be ready whether that’s from the bench or starting. I’m the captain, I have to set an example. 

‘But I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t think I could make a difference. I still want to be the best. I have that hunger.’ 

Keane, sensing the air of negativity, added: ‘It’s up to us to make this a turning point. Victory would give this squad and country a huge confidence boost.’ 

Lose and it could prove an awfully long three months for O’Neill before they host Scotland. Win, and that £1m salary would look like a shrewd investment.
