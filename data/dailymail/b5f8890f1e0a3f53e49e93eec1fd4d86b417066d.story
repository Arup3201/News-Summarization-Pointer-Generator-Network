Israel’s ruling coalition has finally fallen apart, paving the way for an election in March – two years ahead of schedule.

The country’s MPs yesterday overwhelmingly approved a motion to dissolve the parliament, or Knesset, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to iron out differences with coalition partners and called for a poll.

Further votes are due next week that will officially disband the parliament. The government, which took office in early 2013, will be one of the shortest in the country’s history.

On Tuesday, Mr Netanyahu fired two rebellious ministers. His fractious centre-right cabinet has been bickering for weeks over the budget and a bill that would enshrine into law Israel’s status as a Jewish state.

Rising violence between Palestinians and Israelis has also been an issue, as have the Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
