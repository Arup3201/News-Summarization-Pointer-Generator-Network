FEMEN activists this morning staged a bare-chested protest in Berlin ahead of a planned speech in the city by Barack Obama.

Two women dressed only in denim hotpants struggled with riot police in the German capital's Tiergarten district, near to where the President will speak this afternoon.

Across their breasts and bellies was written the slogan: 'Obama help.'

Don't look! German riot police appear to avert 
their eyes as they detain a FEMEN activist near the Brandenburg Gate in 
Berlin's Tiergarten district this morning, ahead of a speech by U.S. 
president Barack Obama

Obama help! In a statement issued to MailOnline,
 FEMEN explained that the protest was a call to President Obama to 
intervene over the jailing of three of the group's activists over a 
topless protest in Tunisia last month

In a statement emailed to the 
MailOnline, FEMEN explained that the protest was a call for Obama to 
intervene to free activists held in Tunisia and help advance the 
emancipation of women in the Middle East.

'FEMEN
 appeal to the leader of world democracy the president of USA Barack 
Obama about the violation of human rights in the Middle East and ask to 
contribute to the release of Tunisian prisoners of FEMEN,' it said.

'Obama help FEMEN!'

Pictures showed the two German 
activists struggling with heavily armoured riot police officers near the
 Brandenburg Gate, where Obama will appear this afternoon.

They
 appeared to scream and fight with the officers, who took care to grip 
them only by their arms as they led them away from crowds of astonished 
onlookers.

Careful now... German police appear to take care to hold this FEMEN protester by her arms as they cuff her

Modus operandi: The group, which has its origins in the Ukraine, is famous for its topless protests

Three of the group's activists were sentenced to four months in prison last week after staging a topless protest in the country's capital demanding the release of a Tunisian FEMEN activist.

Marguerite Stern and Pauline Hillier, from France, and Josephine Markmann, from Germany, were arrested on 29 May as they protested bare-chested in front of the Tunis Court building.

The trio had approached the entrance to the ministry wearing coats which they took off, revealing naked torsos scrawled with 'Breasts Feed Revolution'.

Wearing just jean shorts, the women chanted in English 'Free Amina' and 'Women's spring is coming' as people in the crowd attempted to cover them.

The women then climbed up on the gates of the Justice Ministry until police pulled them down and hustled them shouting into the building as an angry crowd gathered.

Supporters: Tunisian security arrest French Femen activist Pauline Hillier for taking part in a topless protest outside the
 Ministry of Justice in the capital Tunis against the earlier arrest of fellow activist 
Amina Tyler

Baring all: From left, Hillier, German activist Josephine Markmann and Marguerite Stern, from France. The trio were last week sentenced to four months and one day in jail for charges relating to the protest

They were protesting in support of Amina Tyler, 19, who was arrested days earlier.

She
 had sparked outrage in the conservative country by posting topless 
pictures of herself to Facebook wearing the slogan 'My body belongs to 
me' in Arabic across her bare chest.

She
 was taken into hiding by her family after conservative preachers issued
 death threats against her, including one who called for her to be 
stoned to death.

But she later attempted another protest on May 19 in the religious centre of Kairouan, where she was arrested.

Amnesty
 International has condemned the convictions for public indecency, 
undermining public morals, and making noise disturbing peace as 'an 
unacceptable restriction on freedom of expression'.

The naked truth: Amina Tyler, 19, caused outrage
 in her native Tunisia when she posted topless photos of 
herself wearing the slogan 'My body belongs to me' on her Facebook page in a protest over women's rights

Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, deputy Middle East and North Africa programme director at Amnesty, last week said: 'Imprisoning people for expression is inherently disproportionate.

'Even if some may consider the three women's protest offensive or counter-productive, this cannot justify placing them behind bars.

'If the Tunisian authorities are serious about respecting their international human rights obligations, they should release the three women.'

FEMEN today confirmed to MailOnline that two of its activists had been arrested in Berlin and were being held in police custody.

The group, which has its origins in the Ukraine, is fast becoming famous for its topless protests.

President Obama's speech at the Brandenburg Gate this afternoon is expected to revive proposals for nuclear weapons disarmament.
