McLaren racing director Eric Boullier declared himself satisfied despite a difficult opening day on Honda's official return to Formula One.

After 20 years being powered by Mercedes, the Woking-based marque are now reunited with Honda, rekindling memories of their glory days together in the late 1980s.

On the first day of the new partnership at a two-day post-season test in Abu Dhabi, Honda naturally encountered teething problems with their version of the 1.6-litre V6 turbo-charged power units that were used over the past season by rivals Mercedes, Ferrari and Renault.

Stoffel Vandoorne was the first to drive the new Honda powered McLaren at the Abu Dhabi test

McLaren have reunited with Honda but teething problems meant Vandoorne could only complete three laps

Problems with fuel/data exchange meant Honda's first run only lasted three laps before grinding to a halt out on the circuit which brought out a red flag and required the car to be brought back to the pits

1988: Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna (WC)  199 points, 1st in constructors' championship

1989: Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost (WC)  141 points, 1st in constructors' championship

1990: Ayrton Senna (WC) and Gerhard Berger  121 points, 1st in constructors' championship

1991: Ayrton Senna (WC) and Gerhard Berger  138 points, 1st in constructors' championship 

1992: Ayrton Senna and Gerhard Berger          99 points, 2nd in constructors' championship

(WC) = world champion

An electronics issue meant the car spent the morning in the garage, and although it broke cover after lunch it managed only three laps in the afternoon.

On two occasions there were issues with the fuel/data exchange, the second of which brought out a red flag leaving driver Stoffel Vandoorne stranded on the circuit.

But with the two days designed to iron out problems ahead of the first pre-season test of next year in early February in Jerez, Boullier was happy enough.

'Running a modern Formula One car is a very complicated procedure,' said Boullier.

'This week's test is all about how the departments at Sakura, Milton Keynes (Honda's bases in Japan and the UK) and Woking learn to work with the operational hub at the circuit.

McLaren and Honda hope to bring back the glory days of the late 1980s and early 1990s when drivers such as Ayrton Senna helped the duo dominate Formula One as a team

McLaren have ended a 20-year partnership with Mercedes which included highlights such as Lewis Hamilton's first championship win in 2008

'This test is an opportunity for us to build up that operational strength, to get McLaren and Honda working together under the same roof.

'We encountered a number of issues, including a lengthy check of electrical installations this morning.

'But it's satisfying to see we got the engine fired up, the car out of the garage and some laps on the board in the afternoon.

'We're not chasing laptimes this week, it's about gradually expanding our knowledge.

'Tomorrow will hopefully be all about conducting longer runs as we learn about different parts of the engine, and run through each separate system.'
