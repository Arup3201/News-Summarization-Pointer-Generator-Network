Airlines have cancelled nearly 14,000 flights for today and tomorrow with more cancellations expected as Hurricane Sandy barrels up the Atlantic coast of the United States.

The massive storm threatens to bring a near halt to air travel for at least two days in a key region for both domestic and international flights.

Flight-tracking service FlightAware reported cancellations by major carriers including American Airlines, United and Delta into and out of three area airports in New York, the nation's busiest airspace.

Tens of thousands of stranded passengers are now waiting out the storm across the world, in travel hubs including London, Paris, Tokyo and Hong Kong.

Cancellations: All flights out of New York's three airports, including JFK (pictured), have been grounded

Airports in the metropolitan New York City area are open, but air carriers are not operating.

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said today that travelers should not even try to go to Kennedy, Newark Liberty, LaGuardia and Stewart airports.

Both Philadelphia International Airport and Newark International Airport, a hub for United Airlines, each had more than 1,300 cancellations for last night and 6,814 cancelled as of 9am on Monday.

Amtrak says it has canceled all Tuesday service in the Northeast due to high winds and heavy rain from Hurricane Sandy.

The railroad said passenger service between Boston and Raleigh, North Carolina, and between the East Coast and Chicago, New Orleans and Florida will be suspended for the second day in a row.

Cancellations include Acela Express, Northeast Regional, Keystone and Shuttle service, among other trains.

Passengers were urged to follow developments on Amtrak.com and Facebook and Twitter sites. No decision has yet been made on when service will be resumed.

Amtrak said passengers who have paid but who didn't travel because of the service disruption can receive a refund or a voucher for future travel.

Stranded: Tens of thousands of passengers, including these tired travellers at JFK, face further delays today

She's coming: A satellite image taken Sunday morning by the National Hurricane Center shows Sandy heading north

Businessman Alan 
Shrem was trying to return home to Boca Raton, Florida this morning, but
 his Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong to New York's Kennedy airport 
was canceled.

He was told he 
could be stuck in Hong Kong for nearly a week because the next available
 seat was November 4. He was put on a waiting list for seats that could 
become available earlier.

'They
 just say: Yeah, it's a pretty big waiting list,' said Shrem, throwing 
up his hands. In the meantime, he will have to pay $400 a night to stay 
at a nearby hotel. The airline will not pay for accommodation for 
stranded passengers if delays are weather related.

Air travel in the Northeast began having
 problems last night, when passengers were reporting delays of hours at 
airline call centers.

Eileen Merberg, 50, was booked on a United flight from her home in Rochester, N.Y. to New Orleans, connecting at Washington D.C.'s Dulles airport.

She received an email saying the Washington flight was canceled. United rebooked her first on a flight through Newark and, when that flight was also canceled, on another flight through Chicago.

By that point, she
 had told the higher education conference that she was scheduled to 
speak at that she would not be coming. She tried to cancel her flight 
over the phone but waiting times were so long she could not get through.

FlightAware said it expects the number of flight cancellations to 'rise considerably.'

A
 spokesman for United Airlines parent United Continental Holdings Inc. 
said the carrier has suspended an unspecified number of flights to New 
York and Washington-area airports from last night, with plans to
 resume on Tuesday if conditions permit.

JetBlue 
Airways Corp., which flies out of JFK, said it has canceled more than 
1,000 flights from Sunday through Wednesday morning.

While other airlines will most likely
 follow United in paring down their confirmed flight schedules, carriers
 can point to last year's Hurricane Irene as a precedent of likely 
action they will take.

The New York Stock Exchange floor will be closed today as Hurricane Sandy churns up the coastline

During
 a four-day period in August 2011, as Irene approached the Eastern 
Seaboard, 14,000 flights were halted as the hurricane traveled over 
major hubs such as Philadelphia, Newark and JFK airports.

Every
 major airline in the U.S. has at one hub or 'center city' and some, 
such as United (Newark and Washington Dulles) and US Airways 
(Philadelphia and Washington National), have two.

Even a slight disruption to one of these airports would affect thousands of flights and tens of thousands of passengers.

If
 the flight cancellations continue, it could lead to havoc which would 
create gridlock in the U.S. aviation system and create a backlog of 
stranded passengers.

However, Sandy is expected to remain in 
the area for at least 48 hours and disruption to flights is expected to 
be far greater than that experienced during Irene.

Prepared: The NYSE opened a day after Hurricane Irene reached NYC last year but that storm hit on a Sunday rather than the start of the business week

Stay home: Along with the NYSE most New York transportation is on hold and schools are closed as the city waits for Sandy

Forecasters say Sandy is about 310 miles
 (505 kilometers) southeast of New York City, and the center of the 
storm is expected to be near the mid-Atlantic coast tonight.

The
 National Hurricane Center said early today that the storm has top 
sustained winds of 85 mph (140 kph), with higher gusts, and is on 
track to collide with a wintry storm moving in from the west and cold 
air streaming down from the Arctic.

Every airline has issued a flexible travel policy that allows customers 
to make changes to their reservations with no penalty and passengers have been told to contact their carrier.

New York is bracing for the storm, with the mass transit system shut down last night, as the city waits for Sandy.

The New York Stock
 
Exchange's trading floor will be closed Monday and Tuesday as Hurricane Sandy bears 
down on the East Coast, but Big Board trading will continue 
electronically.

NYSE Euronext said Sunday that it 
is putting in place its contingency plans beginning today and will 
announce later when the trading floor will reopen.

Trading
has rarely stopped for weather: a blizzard led to a late start and an 
early close on January 8, 1996, according to the exchange's parent company,
NYSE Euronext. The NYSE shut down on March 27, 1985 for Hurricane 
Gloria.

The 
longest suspension in trading at the NYSE since the Great Depression occurred following the attacks on 
the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, when the exchange closed for 
four days.
