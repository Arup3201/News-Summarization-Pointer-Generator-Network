Christmas was cut dramatically short for residents of a famous New York apartment building after its facade collapsed onto the sidewalk - forcing them to flee into the night.

The drama unfolded after part of a structural wall belonging to the O'Neill Building, on Sixth Avenue, crumbled as many of its occupants tucked into Christmas dinner on Tuesday evening.

Local authorities immediately evacuated the block amid fears the former department store - the city's first when built in 1887 - might buckle.

'We were given a few minutes to 
collect medication or anything we needed' before being ushered out,' 
resident Anna Backer told WNYW-Fox 5 TV.

By Boxing Day, the building was still on lockdown, with residents on the West 20th Street side told to find somewhere else to spend the rest of the festive period while builders worked to repair the damaged wall.

No one was injured, but the building was evacuated, the fire department said.

The evacuation was ordered as a 
precaution after officials saw some small cracks in the wall where the 
facade fell, Fire Chief Tom McCarthy told reporters.

'It caused some concern on our part,' 
he said. He said engineering inspections Wednesday would determine how 
soon residents would be allowed to return.

Resident Eva Laboz told reporters she'd seen a crack in the wall some days before.

'They put the yellow tape over, but I didn't know it was going to be that serious,' she said.

He husband Maurice, 75, who has lived 
in the building’s penthouse for five years, said: 'The building won’t fall. They don’t build buildings like this 
anymore.'

Historic: The seven-story building on Sixth Avenue, between and West 20th and West 21st streets, was built in 1887 as a department store called O'Neill's

A city Buildings Department spokesman didn't immediately respond to phone and email messages asking about the collapse. The phone rang unanswered at the building's management company.

The seven-story building on Sixth Avenue, between and West 20th and West 21st streets, was built in 1887 as a department store called O'Neill's.

The building was converted into 49 condominiums in recent years. A recent real estate listing offers a two-bedroom apartment for sale at $3.7 million.

Buildings Department records show the facade was inspected in February and declared safe.

Records show some sprinkler system work and first-floor restaurant renovations have been under way in recent months.
