Dragons' Den star Peter Jones has relaunched camera chain Jessops - two months after it was forced from the High Street.

Two Jessops stores will open today in London's Oxford Street and Birmingham, with four others opening over the Easter weekend in Manchester, Aberdeen, High Wycombe and St Albans.

Up to 30 more Jessops stores are due to re-open in April, as part of a £5 million investment.

Jessops called in administrators PwC in January, leading to the closure of all 187 Jessops stores and the loss of almost 1,500 jobs.

Later that month Mr Jones and other investors bought the brand and certain assets. The entrepreneur is the sole owner of the relaunched camera store chain.

The company has pledged to create 500 jobs with its relaunch - with the majority going to former Jessops staff who lost their jobs when the chain collapsed.

Mr Jones, who appears as an investor on the BBC reality TV series about entrepreneurs, will take the role of chief executive and chairman.

He said: 'I believe Jessops is an iconic British brand which can lead the retail resurgence on Britain's high streets, powered by new innovations and world-leading, expert staff.

'Image is everything, and even in the mobile and tablet era, there's no substitute for a quality camera when it comes to taking the perfect picture.'

Mr Jones opened the Oxford Street store today with TV comic James Corden.

The
relaunched company is forecasting sales of at least £80 million in its 
first year, which it said will give it 15 per cent of the DSLR camera 
market in the UK. Jessops also promised greater integration with its 
online presence, including an option to collect internet orders at 
store.

The camera giant was
the first high-profile retail casualty of 2013, after suffering from 
online competition and a boom in camera phones in recent years, which 
hit demand for digital cameras.

At its appointment, PwC said the company's core market had seen a 'significant decline' in 2012, while forecast profits over Christmas did not materialise, squeezing its funding.

Jessops had struggled since 2007, when it underwent a major overhaul with a swathe of store closures.

The firm began life in 1935 when Frank Jessop opened his first shop in Leicester.

Writing in The Sun today, Mr Jones said while 'so-called experts' say the High Street no future, he believes 'the facts say otherwise'.

Mr Jones said shopper numbers on the High Street were up by 2.7 per cent last month compared to the previous year, according to the British Retail Consortium.

He said while the business could have been relaunched online, he knew there was a desire for a 'proper shopping experience'.

He said: 'I also think it's time we snapped out of our negativity about the economy, and got behind the great British brands and institutions that can lead the recovery.

'That's why I've declared myself "in" to what I think will be the first step in the revival of our high streets.'

He added things were looking up for British shoppers, with Blockbuster also set to re-open in the near future.

The High Street has seen some turbulent times in recent years, but the latest development could be a sign of changing fortunes.
