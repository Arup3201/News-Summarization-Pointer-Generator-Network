A retired stockbroker who mowed down a woman after mistaking the brake of his classic Mercedes for the accelerator at 50mph has been jailed for 18 months.

Geoffrey Lederman, 83, had careered onto the pavement and ploughed into Desreen Brooks and only narrowly missed her son, as her horrified husband looked on.

The 33-year-old mother, from South London, was killed and a young woman suffered brain damage and lost an eye in the crash, a court heard.

Witnesses described seeing Lederman's 1982 Mercedes 380SL 'screaming' along West End Lane in upmarket West Hampstead, north London, amid a cloud of smoke before hurtling along the footpath at speed, the court heard.

Ms Brooks had been walking with her husband, Ben Brooks-Dutton, a director for PR agency Freuds, who managed to push their son Jackson's pram clear, but was unable to save his wife, who died of her injuries.

The family of the Ms Brooks have since been praised for their 'courage'.

Blackfriars Crown Court heard following the crash Lederman's doctor had bizarrely recommended he get back on the road as soon as possible.

The doctor suggested this would help Lederman, who has had a suicide attempt, recover his 'state of mind.'

The collision, which happened on 10 November 2012, also left Amy Werner, a 23-year-old student at the University of Westminster originally from Vermont, seriously injured.

Ms Werner fell into a three-week coma and now suffers from chronic cerebral damage, as well as the permanent loss of sight in one of her eyes.

Lederman, who was driving at up to 54mph, kept his foot on the accelerator of the 3.8 litre V8 Mercedes for '19 to twenty seconds' before running into a brick wall.

He suffered a fractured sternum and had to be cut out of the car, Blackfriars Crown Court heard.

Lederman, who had impaired eyesight and have previously suffered a stroke, had failed to spot pedestrians on the pavement as he tried to stop his runaway car by smashing into a garden wall.

Christopher Donellan QC, in mitigation, said his client was genuinely remorseful for what had happened. 

'For each individual, it is so devastating. We fully understand the hurt and pain experienced by Mr Brooks-Dutton.

'What we have is a very elderly man and an episode has taken place during his drive that he was unable to sort out.

'He doesn't know (that he should not have been driving). We don't have a system in this country which properly assesses people. He was on a three-year licence renewal and his doctor didn't ever suggest he shouldn't drive.' 

Jailing Lederman, Judge Peter Clarke QC said: 'It is clear to me that you made the cardinal error of mistaking the accelerator for the brake. 

'I should make it clear that I am entirely satisfied that you were fatigued after playing several hours of contract bridge, your powerful car slipped out of gear... and in your tiredness you put the car back in gear when the accelerator was deeply depressed.' 

Judge Clarke noted Lederman's previously flawless record, and noted that he had been driving for 50 years - 32 with the Mercedes.

'I recognise that you have said to doctors that it was you rather than those young women who should have suffered and died, for you have had a long life and theirs has been ended and blighted,' Judge Clarke continued.

'The sentence I am about to pass is not in order to make an example of you, but it must be understood that old age cannot be seen as as any excuse of mitigation for dangerous or even careless driving.

'An elderly driver who knows or should acknowledge that he or she is losing his or her faculties is no less a danger than a drunken driver who knows the same.

'Your lifetime of blameless driving is of no comfort to the Brooks-Dutton family.'

Lederman, who had impaired eyesight and had previously suffered a stroke, was excused from attending the trial.

He was unanimously convicted in his absence of causing death by dangerous driving but acquitted of causing grievous bodily harm to Ms Werner. 

Mr Brooks-Dutton, who attended the entire trial with his grieving parents-in-law, wept and visibly shook as the verdict was announced.

The family of the Ms Brooks have since been praised for their 'courage'  by police in the face of Lederman's refusal to plead guilty'

The family have been praised for their 'courage' by police in the face of Lederman's refusal to plead guilty.'

Detective Sergeant Cheryl Frost, of the Met's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: 'This case highlights how a momentary mistake resulted in a tragic death of a mother and caused life changing injuries to another young woman.

'It is important for motorists to regularly monitor their driver behaviour and that of their elderly relatives to ensure that the roads are safe for all road users.

'Lederman confused the pedals of the car and instead of braking as he approached a bend too fast he accelerated into a group of pedestrians causing horrific injuries to Desreen Brooks who died at the scene.

'I would like to pay tribute to Desreen's family as well as Amy Werner and her family for the courage they have shown during this time, prolonged by Lederman's refusal to plead guilty and take responsibility for his actions.'

Judge Clarke earlier said Lederman had been 'an in-patient following a suicide attempt' and there were fears about his state of mind.

Defence barrister, Christopher Donnellan QC, said in his mitigation that he was 'not in any way trying to minimise the consequences of what happened..'

'In doing so [mitigating] we are acutely conscious that Mr Brooks-Dutton, his son, his family, have sat throughout the the trial and have suffered in the way none of us can properly understand,' Mr Donnellan said.

'In addressing these matters we are making absolutely no excuses.'

Mr Donnellan said it was an 'awful thing' that there isn't a system in place in this country that assesses the faculties of elderly people and their ability to drive.

He said that tragically Lederman was unaware of his own deteriorating faculties.

He added that he was left 'aghast' when Lederman's doctor suggested the defendant get out on the road again as soon as possible.

The court then heard Lederman was suffering from a pre-dementia condition, and that his health - including a weak heart - is likely to detereorate inside prison.

Jurors were shown harrowing CCTV footage of the blue Mercedes travelling at high speed before crossing onto the wrong side of the road, onto the path and into the women, at around 8.30pm.

The defence maintained throughout that Lederman had suffered a 'medical aberration'.

Dr Dominic Heaney, a consultant neurologist, told the court the pensioner looked 'confused about his accelerator and his environment' before the smash.

He said Lederman's apparent amnesia after the crash could have been another symptom of a neurological episode.

But, according to the prosecution, the elderly driver 'deliberately steered' his car onto the pavement in a bid to stop it.

Lederman, of from Maida Vale, in London, was convicted of causing death by dangerous driving but acquitted of causing grievous bodily harm. He was sentenced to 18 months in jail.

Speaking after Lederman's conviction, Mr Dutton-Brooks said: 'The inability of an 83-year-old driver to distinguish the accelerator from the brake of a car that he had been driving for over 30 years is the reason why my son will grow up without his mother.

'Perhaps it is time for us to question how fit certain individuals are to be on the road.

'I appeal to anyone who might be concerned that it is time for their elderly or infirm friends or relatives to stop driving not to delay. Do something before it's too late.'

Mr Brooks-Dutton added he could not forgive the legal manoeuvres by Lederman's lawyers - attempts 'to avoid this case being heard in a timely fashion' or have it thrown out entirely.

'What happened was a tragedy for all parties and no result could ever have remedied the pain felt by its many victims. We have all suffered.

'At no time have my family and I been shown any true signs of remorse or consideration through the defendant's approach to this trial.'
