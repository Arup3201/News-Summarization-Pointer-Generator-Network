The wife of former Atlanta Braves star Andruw Jones has filed for divorce from her husband a week after he allegedly grabbed her neck and said he wanted to kill her, according to court documents.

Nicole Jones said their ten-year marriage was 'irretrievably broken', according to the divorce complaint filed in a suburban Atlanta court on Monday.

The filing does not mention the Christmas morning fight that prompted Nicole Jones to call police and led to Andruw Jones' arrest on a battery charge.

Fight: Police say they were called to Andruw Jones' home in a wealthy suburb of Atlanta and found him fighting with his wife of ten years, Nicole Derick Jones, who has not filed for divorce

Nicole Jones' lawyer, John Mayoue, 
declined to comment on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear whether 
Andruw Jones had a lawyer.

Nicole Jones is seeking joint legal and primary custody of the couple's nine-year-old son, the complaint said.

She is asking for child support, 
alimony and half of the couple's property. She also wants a judge to 
declare their prenuptial agreement null and void.

The couple fought around 1:30am on 
December 25 after Nicole Jones asked her husband to help prepare their 
home for Christmas morning, a Gwinnett County police report said.

She tried to go upstairs, but her husband grabbed her by the ankle and dragged her down some stairs, the report said.

He got on top of her and said: 'I want to kill you,' according to the report.

She was able to push him away because he was drunk and then she went to her parents' house, the report said.

Police said they found injuries on her neck, which they photographed for evidence.

Big league star: Jones played for the Atlanta Braves from 1996 until 2007, where he won ten consecutive Golden Glove awards for his skill as an outfielder. He played last season with the New York Yankees

When officers arrived at the Jones 
residence in the Sugarloaf Country Club in Duluth and approached him in a
bedroom, they said he appeared to have passed out in his clothes and 
was confused about what had happened.

Gwinnett County jail records showed Andruw Jones was freed on bond after his arrest.

Jones earlier this month signed a 
$3.5 million, one-year contract with the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles of
Japan's Pacific League.

Nicole said she asked her husband to 
put together a computer desk with her in the garage, during which time 
he became more and more belligerent, according to the police report, and
they got into an argument that became 'pretty heated'.

She
said that Jones grabbed her arm, and dragged her across the floor of 
the garage until she slipped out of his grip and went back into the 
house.

But Jones quickly followed and allegedly grabbed her ankle as she climbed up some stairs in the house, dragging her back down.

According to his wife, he put his hands around her neck and said: 'I want to kill you, I want to f***ing kill you.'

Cops said in their report that Nicole Jones suffered visible injuries on her neck as a result of the altercation.

Once a premier player in the big 
leagues, Jones broke into the majors with the Atlanta Braves in 1996 and
won 10 consecutive Gold Gloves from 1998-07 as their center fielder.

He has 434 career home runs over 17 seasons in the majors.

Mostly recently, he played for the New York Yankees last season in 2012 and was released as a free agent.

In 2001, he testified in the prostitution case against an Atlanta strip club owner. While Jones was never charged, he said that he was invited to the Gold Club and that he was propositioned for sex by two strippers.

He testified under oath that he had sex with both the women in front of the club's owner and six other men.
