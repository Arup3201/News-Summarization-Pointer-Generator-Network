A food distributor that provides produce to countless Asian restaurants throughout the East Coast and into the Midwest has been hit with a long list of disgusting health code violations.

The New Yung Wah Trading Co. is a Brooklyn-based company with a warehouse in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, which the Food and Drug Administration paid a visit to in October.

A letter sent to the company's owners earlier this month details the horrific scenes discovered at the warehouse including 'a rodent's nest with multiple rodents in a plastic-lined box in a cooler that had thawing rib meat on top of melons' and 'a pallet of pineapples in boxes gnawed on by rodents, an apparent nest they made and rodent feces'.

The letter, posted on the U.S Department of Health and Human Service's website, also detailed the presence of dead rodents, 'birds flying throughout the warehouse,' bags of MSG contaminated with rodent urine and feces, and 'workers smoking while handling food being prepared for distribution.'

FDA inspectors also identified issues including 'puddles of standing water' due to a faulty drain and noted how rodent poison had been used in the warehouse without the correct precautions taken to keep it from contaminating food.

'This rodenticide was placed on plastic plates next to stored food products along the exterior walls of the facility,' the FDA said.

The entire warehouse was so densely packed with bags of food, the FDA said, that those working there couldn't inspect for rodents.

'Pallets storing food products were stacked approximately two high and six to eight deep, covering an area of approximately 3000 square feet. The pallets were stacked directly against one another, which did not allow adequate spacing to inspect or observe possible rodent activity,' said the FDA.

New Yung Wah's website states that it is 'currently under construction' and the company hasn't responded to the FDA's findings.

Among the violations reported by the FDA was rodent feces, urine and nests in and around bags of monosodium glutamate (stock image)

Among the findings in the inspection of the company's warehouse were:

The company sells meat/poultry, produce, frozen products, canned products, dry products, packaging/disposable products, seafood products, and noodles/skins.

The list of restaurants which has recently receiving goods from New Yung Wah isn't know although it is believed to be extensive as the company served both wholesalers, retailers and restaurants throughout the East Coast. 

The company was founded in 1993 and is based in Brooklyn, New York with facilities located in New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. 

This isn't New Yung Wah has been in trouble over issues of health code violations.

Earlier this year, an Ohio-bound delivery truck with 150 pounds of spoiled food headed for Chinese and Japanese restaurants was intercepted by police.

The fish, chicken and pork was allegedly at unsafe temperatures, between 58 degrees and 68 degrees, and dripping onto other food causing cross contamination, reports Daily Finance.

The FDA's correspondence to the company also notes that while they received a letter from New Yung Wah in November stating that they had 'aggressively addressed' the violations, no proof has yet to be provided.
