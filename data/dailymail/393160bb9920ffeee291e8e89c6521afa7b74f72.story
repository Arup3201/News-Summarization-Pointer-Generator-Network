Shaun Akanbi was stabbed to death and found dead in his flat in Kilburn in December

A fashion designer was stabbed through the heart by a man he befriended and asked round to his north London flat, the Old Bailey has heard.

The body of Shaun Akanbi, 26, who dressed the likes of Ms.Dynamite and Tinie Tempah, was found in his locked bedroom at the flat he shared with others in Exeter Road, Kilburn, in December.

Police broke down the door after police and family said they were concerned no-one had seen him for three days. He had been stabbed five times.

Achraf Jandara, 20, is accused of murdering Mr Akanbi before ransacking his flat and fleeing wearing clothes from the victim's label Billy Boyce.

The Moroccan was captured on CCTV walking
 off with a rucksack and trolley bag and dressed in a jacket bearing the
Billy Boyce logo.

The court was told that Mr Akanbi and 
Jandara had previously swapped messages over Facebook and Mr Finnigan 
said the 'apparent purpose of the meeting was connected to proposed or 
actual sexual activity.'

Peter Finnigan, QC, prosecuting told the court: 'The motive for the killing was very probably robbery. Items were stolen from the flat.

'[Mr Akanbi] had already attained a fair amount of success. He was talented. He was reasonably well-off. He was also sociable and well-loved.'

Jandara, 20, of Camberwell, south London, denies murder.

The jurors were told Jandara was claiming someone else murdered Mr Akanbi and that he was the first to come across the body.

Fans of the Billy Boyce brand, named after Mr Akanbi’s father, include Brit award winner Miss Dynamite and Fazer from grime trio N-Dubz.

Mr Akanbi founded the label while studying at the London College of Fashion in 2009.

He was last seen alive by a pizza delivery driver who dropped off food at the victim's flat at about 10.40pm on the night he died.

The driver later told police he saw the 
victim with a white man with a distinctive long face and long skinny 
nose, although he was unable to identify Jandara.

Mr Finnigan told the court that Jandara's footprint was found in Mr Akanbi's flat and his DNA was on a mug in the bedroom.

He said he stumbled across the body of Mr Akanbi.

Mr Finnigan said: ‘The new defence is 
the murderer slipped in and out of the building unobserved by CCTV, 
conveniently leaving the door open for the defendant to find the body.

'You will have to consider why he did not call the police or emergency services. Instead he stripped the flat of as many of Shaun Akanbi’s possessions as he could bodily carry out of the flat.

‘He even had on Shaun’s clothes which he got from a rack on the flat.

‘Shaun had his own special unique line of clothes with his own logo - you can see it on the CCTV.’

Mr Akanbi’s Macbook laptop was sold by Jandara’s cousin two days after the murder for £160, the court heard.

Jurors heard the murder weapon has not been found.

The trial has been adjourned until tomorrow.
