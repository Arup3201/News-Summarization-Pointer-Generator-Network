Best friends who were days away from dying of a deadly lung disease have been saved after receiving life saving transplants on the same day.

Kirstie Tancock, 24, and Katie Gammon, 15, both from Devon, both suffer from cystic fibrosis.

The pair were so ill that their families were preparing for the worst - and Katie had even been transferred to a hospice.

Waiting: The girls, who were days away from dying of a deadly lung disease, were saved after receiving life saving transplants on the same day

But remarkably, on the same day in August this year, both girls were told that donors had been found.

The pair are now fighting fit, and are looking forward to Christmas with their families.

Kirstie said: 'I couldn’t believe how lucky I had been to find another donor match but for Katie to get her wish too and on the same day - it was the best day of our lives.'

Doctors told Kirstie that she was being transferred to a hospice after her first transplant from 2011 began failing.

Kirstie added: 'I went from being told I was going to die to doctors putting me on the transplant list and miraculously receiving a second transplant.'

Her friend Katie Gammon, 15, had been on the waiting list for a lung transplant for 14 months when a match was finally found.

Change: Katie at Christmas last year, when she was waiting for a transplant. Both girls had successful operations and have recovered well

They had both even planned their own funerals because they had become so unwell.

Kirstie said: 'I didn’t want to make the situation any worse for my husband and family so I thought planning my funeral myself would help them.'

The friends first met on social networking site Facebook through a CF communitysupport page.

Katie said: 'I met Kirstie online and we instantly became friends as we had so much in common because of our condition.

'She is not only my best friend but an inspiration to many as her journey of survival is incredible.

'We never thought in a million years that we would both get a transplant on the same day.'

Katie said: 'Kirstie had supported me through my journey and we’d become great friends - I couldn’t wait to tell her the news.'

Both girls were diagnosed with CF from birth - the condition causes a sticky mucas to line some organs such as lungs and pancreas.

Despite her excitement, Kirstie had to keep the lung donor news to herself until doctors confirmed everything.

Kirstie said: 'I wrote a status on Facebook that read "I have an exciting secret but I can’t tell you what it is yet" and Katie messaged me straight away to ask if it was lungs.

Moving on: Kirstie and her husband, Stu, have just moved into their first house together - something they never thought would happen due to her ill health

'I felt bad knowing that I was going to receive a second lung transplant when she hadn’t got her first match yet.'

However, Katie, who was struggling to breathe so much so that she was on constant oxygen, also received a lifesaving call that day.

Katie said: 'I went straight onto Facebook to tell Kirstie that I was getting some new lungs too. I couldn’t believe it was happening to us both on the same day.'

Recovered: Katie has now been able to return to school

Her mother, Angie Hart,46, said: 'It was such an emotional time, we were obviously all so relieved but at the same time really nervous as it’s such a big operation.'

Luckily the operations went well and both girls are now looking forward to the future and Christmas.

Katie said: 'I have been able to go back to school now which is great as I missed out on so much when my breathing got really bad.'

Kirstie and her husband, Stu, have just moved into their first house together - something they never thought would happen.

She said: 'I have so much life left in me - I wasn’t ready to die. Because this is my second transplant I have been able to give Katie advice each step of the way.'

Ed Owen, Chief Executive at the Cystic Fibrosis Trust said: 'While life expectancy for people with cystic fibrosis is rising with the introduction of new drugs and treatments, for some a transplant is their only hope.

'It is remarkable that Katie and Kirstie received their transplants on the same day and I hope that like many people who have had a transplant, the results will transform their lives.

'Sadly, one in three people with CF who need a lung transplant will die on the waiting list.

'The Trust is campaigning to ensure everyone who needs a lung transplant will receive one.'
