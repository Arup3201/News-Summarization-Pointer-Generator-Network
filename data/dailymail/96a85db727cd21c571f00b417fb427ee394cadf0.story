Doubt may have been cast over Radamel Falcao's future at Manchester United but the Colombian striker appeared in good spirits after training on Wednesday.

The 28-year-old pulled a double thumbs-up pose for a picture with a United fan and then retweeted the image after it was posted by the youngster on Twitter.

Falcao also retweeted @jackfootball's following post, which exclaimed: 'Can't believe falcao looked more happier than me' accompanied by a crying with laughter emoticon.

The Colombia international was said to be stunned when he was axed from United’s 18-man squad to face Southampton on Sunday after starting the previous five games, and held talks with Van Gaal at Carrington on Monday. 

It has raised serious doubts over United’s intention to go through with a permanent £52million deal, with Falcao’s agent Jorge Mendes admitting that the 28-year-old might have to go elsewhere for regular first-team football. 

‘I don’t know (if he will stay),’ said Mendes. ‘He is a fantastic player and I think it’s very difficult for Manchester United fans. They have an absolutely brilliant player, one of the very best in the world, who would without any doubt play 90 minutes, every time, with any other club.

‘The truth is, now, we don’t know what will happen. What we do know is that he will play for one of the very best clubs in the world next season, whether that is Manchester United or not. I am 100 per cent sure of that. But you know how football works, we’ll see what happens.’

The former Atletico Madrid hitman should be included in United's squad to face QPR at the weekend with Robin van Persie sidelined by an ankle injury, although Falcao will have to make an immediate impression with the Dutchman only expected to be out for one game.
