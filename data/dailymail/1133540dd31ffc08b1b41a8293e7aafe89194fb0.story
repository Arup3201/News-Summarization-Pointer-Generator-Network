The cost of the PPI mis-selling scandal is now more than double that of the Olympic Games, after Lloyds became the latest bank to announce it is putting more cash aside to deal with compensation claims.

Consumer group Which? claimed a 'staggering' £18.4 billion has now been set aside across the industry to tackle the ongoing surge in PPI complaints, eclipsing the £8.9 billion cost of the Olympics.

Lloyds has put aside another £450 million to cover compensation for mis-selling, bringing its total bill to £7.3 billion.

Antonio Horta-Osorio, group chief executive, said the bank is working to 'ensure our customers' complaints are addressed efficiently and fairly'.

However, Which? raised concerns over a 'noticeable drop' in uphold rates of PPI-related complaints made to Lloyds Banking Group by consumers.

Less than half (43 per cent) of these types of complaint were upheld across the group in the second half of 2012, compared with 87 per cent in the same period a year earlier.

The Financial Ombudsman Service, which resolves disputes when customers are unable to come to an agreement with their bank, upheld 86 per cent of PPI-related complaints made about Lloyds TSB in the second half of last year.

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd 
said: 'It is staggering that the cost of the PPI mis-selling scandal now
stands at more than double the cost of the Olympic Games.

'We have repeatedly raised concerns with
the banks, regulators and Financial Ombudsman Service about the 
worrying variation in quality of PPI complaint handling.'

PPI is the insurance sold alongside credit cards, loans and other finance agreements to insure payments are made if the borrower is unable to make them due to sickness or unemployment.

But high numbers of policyholders found that the insurance was useless to them because they are illegible to claim, for example if they are self-employed or over 65 years of age.

Critics claimed the banking industry began aggressively selling PPI to customers after realising that the policies were highly profitable.

The Financial Services Authority said sorting out PPI was one of its priorities in 2005 when it took over the task of regulating the general insurance industry.

The FSA began imposing fines for PPI mis-selling in 2006 before banning one of the worst types of PPI in 2009 – 'single premium' – which was sold to mortgage-buyers and added to their total loan at the start.

The Office for Fair Trading became involved in 2007 and referred PPI to the Competition Commission.

The PPI scandal escalated in 2008, after Which? reported that one in three PPI customers had been sold 'worthless' insurance.

Thousands of consumers then tried to claim compensation for being mis-sold the insurance but the majority were protected.

The FSA then brought in stricter rules for PPI sales. The banking industry tried to argue these standards couldn't be imposed retrospectively but lost its High Court battle.

Banks have now set aside millions to cover compensation for PPI mis-selling claims.

Lloyds customers who have seen their 
PPI claims rejected were recently urged by consumer campaigners to fight
on for compensation after an undercover investigation into the bank by 
The Times found evidence of failures in processing complaints.

Lloyds said at the time that it had taken immediate action and it believed the comments noted by the newspaper to be isolated.

Lloyds said today that PPI complaints now account for a smaller proportion of complaints received by the group.

Some 81 per cent of complaints it receives are about PPI, edging down from 86 per cent in the second half of last year.

It said in a statement: 'The group continues to proactively manage the issue of PPI complaints in order that customers can receive redress if they have been mis-sold.

'This is an ongoing process and we will continue to review all claims in an in-depth manner that produces fair outcomes for customers.'

Last month, chief ombudsman Natalie Ceeney said signs of bad practice in PPI complaints handling procedures were adding to 'an atmosphere of universal suspicion and distrust' among consumers.

She said: 'It will undoubtedly affect our ability to handle complaints as quickly and as smoothly as we would like.'

PPI is the most complained-about financial product that the financial ombudsman has ever seen and it recently took on an extra 1,000 case workers to help it deal with the claims.

The ombudsman deals with complaints about a range of financial products and services, but PPI is the issue where it is most likely to uphold a complaint in consumers' favour.

Almost four-fifths (78 per cent) of PPI complaints made against the industry generally were upheld by the ombudsman in the first quarter of this year.

Banks have blamed claims management firms acting on behalf of consumers for slowing the process down and making it harder for them to weed out genuine claims from bogus ones.
