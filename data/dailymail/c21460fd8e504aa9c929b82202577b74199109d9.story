They have been painstakingly restored and hidden from the public for the past 33 years, but now the gilded bronze doors of the Porta del Paradiso are ready to draw crowds once again.

They were created by Lorenzo Ghiberti in 1452, but after six centuries exposed to the elements, a decision was taken to remove them in 1990 and start the restoration process.

Lasers and chemical baths were used to remove the grime and oxidisation. which had built up over the years, threatening the future of the  awe-inspiring masterpiece. 

Lovingly restored: A photo released by the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo showing the detail of one of the glories of early Renaissance Italian art, Lorenzo Ghiberti's Gate of Paradise for the Florence Baptistery, after the completion restoration project

Labour of love: The Gate, whose famed gilding has been burnished with painstaking care and cutting-edge techniques, will be put on show at the the Museum of the Duomo in Florence from 08 September

The 6ft tall, nine-ton gateway took Ghiberti 27 years to complete and is considered in the art world as seminal work of the early Renaissance for its naturalism and innovative use of perspective.

On seeing the gates in  Florence's main piazza, artist Michelangelo immediately dubbed them the Gate of Paradise and said they could grace the entrance to heaven.

Ghiberti himself said they were 'the most singular work that I have ever made.'
