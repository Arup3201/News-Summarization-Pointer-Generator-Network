Once, when Rihanna wore a bikini, all eyes were on her impressive figure.

These days, those eyes are likely to be somewhat distracted - by her huge collection of tattoos.

The 25-year-old singer has 19 inkings in total, many of which can be seen in the photograph below.

In the last year alone she has had large inkings on her hand and ribcage, which were particularly noticable during a photoshoot in her native Barbados this week.

By contrast, the front of her body looked relatively unmarked when she was on holiday in Hawaii early last year.

Rihanna has become a self-confessed tattoo addict since having her first one in 2006.

She once revealed she likes 'hanging out in tattoo shops', adding: 'I am so intrigued by tattoos. It's an entire culture.'
