A drunk Qantas passenger on a Sydney-bound flight was so desperate for another drink that he busted free from four sets of handcuffs after being restrained by two undercover federal police.

The man's unruly behaviour on the flight from Bangkok caused it to make an unscheduled landing at Cairns in Queensland.

It is believed the passenger, 34, was trying to pilfer whisky from a service area on QF24.

A drunk man believed to be in his 20s was arrested on a Qantas flight and broke out of handcuffs four times

He reportedly shouted intermittently for hours and yelled 'turn off the f***ing light c***', according to Fairfax Media.

The flight landed an hour and half later than expected at 9.10am on Sunday.

A statement from Qantas confirmed the incident and said a diversion was caused by 'an intoxicated passenger'.

'Australian Federal Police met the aircraft on arrival into Cairns and escorted the passenger off the aircraft,' the statement said.

'Qantas has a zero tolerance approach to anti-social behaviour on our aircraft.

'The aircraft has since landed in Sydney.' 

A Qantas spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia it would be inappropriate to comment further on the matter as it was now with the police.

The man has been charged with behaving in an offensive and disorderly manner on an aircraft and will appear on Monday in Cairns Magistrates Court. 

'[Officers] boarded the plane when it landed at Cairns Airport and removed the passenger without incident,' an AFP spokesman told Daily Mail Australia.

It comes almost two months after a pair of drunk women - believed to be in their 20s - forced two Canadian fighter jets to escort a Cuban-bound flight back to Toronto after they made threats against Sunwing Flight 656.

The two passengers downed a large amount of duty-free alcohol in the toilet before setting off the smoke alarms by lighting a cigarette and then got into a fight.

They ended up making threats against the plane, which were 'considered non-credible given their condition'.
