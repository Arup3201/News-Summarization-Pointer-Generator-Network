The head of a Christian lobby group has claimed Tom Daley, right, is homosexual, because his father Robert, left, died

The head of a Christian charity has today provoked outrage by reportedly claiming Olympic diver Tom Daley is homosexual because his father died.

Andrea Minichiello Williams, the founder of lobby group Christian Concern, has been accused of exacerbating suicidal thoughts among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people across the world.

It comes as LGBT campaigners within the Church of England brand her unchristian and her comments 'deeply damaging to the Christian faith and the Church'.

She is said to have rejected the notion that homosexuality is inborn, blaming the 'lack of the father' and 'sometimes a level of abuse' for creating homosexual thoughts, the Independent reported.

Drawing an example, Mrs Williams, who was speaking at a conference in Jamaica, pointed to the case of Olympic diver Tom Daley, who came out in a YouTube selfie video last month.

She blamed the death of Daley's father Robert in 2011 as being the catalyst for his homosexual feelings.

She said Daley had been 'loved by all the girls and had girlfriends', but had 'lost his father to cancer just a few years ago'.

Mrs Williams, who is an elected member of the Church of England General Synod - the body which passes measures which once approved by Parliament become law - was visiting the Caribbean island to lobby against moves to change the law, which currently bans sex between men.

An 1864 Jamaican law prohibits sex between men. But in June Javed Jaghai, a gay right's activist, appeared in court on the island in an effort to bring constitutional change.

She said: 'Might it be that Jamaica says to the United States of America, says to Europe; "Enough! You cannot come in and attack our families. We will not accept aid or promotion tied to an agenda that is against God and destroys our families,' reported US website Buzzfeed.

Pro Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and 
Transgender (LGBT) groups have today condemned Mrs Williams' claims, 
branding her 'unchristian' and accusing her of 'damaging the Church of 
England'.

Reverend Colin Coward, director of Changing Attitude, a network of LGBT members of the Church of England campaigning for full inclusion, said

'Andrea Minichiello Williams is repeating the familiar myth that is repeatedly used by those campaigning against full inclusion of LGBT Christians in the church both in the UK and the US.

'They rely on out-of-date, flawed research and authors to support this.

'Those who are reasonably content with being gay, the huge majority know that this (the lack of a father) has no relationship with being gay.

'Being gay is a personal identity, it is my identity and Mrs Williams is simply trying to perpetuate an anti-gay theology.

'What she is doing is unchristian and against the teaching of the Church of England, which has repeatedly stated it fully welcomes and accepts lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.

'I think she (Mrs Williams) may be naive but what she is doing something that is deeply damaging to the Christian faith as well as to the people who are naturally gay and whose gender and sexual identity is different to the majority.

'In doing so she exacerbates feelings of depression and suicidal thoughts of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Christians across the world.'

Echoing Rev Coward's criticism of Mrs Williams, the LGBT charity Stonewall said her comments were 'sad'.

Sam Dick, the charity's head of policy, said: ‘It’s sad that, during the season of peace and love, these campaigners are supporting the prosecution of gay people simply for how they were born.

'We’re sure many Christians would believe that the more Christian course of action would be to spend their time fighting issues like poverty and disease.’

Yesterday Martin Warner, the Bishop of Chichester, where Mrs Williams was elected to the General Synod in 2011, condemned the comments.

He told the Independent that they had 'no sanction in the Church of England' and that they 'should be rejected as offensive and unacceptable'.

When approached by the MailOnline Christian Concern said Mrs Williams is not currently available for comment.
