A Missouri lawyer has been accused of posting nude pictures of a Virginia prosecutor to Twitter after they broke up.

Denise Lunsford, the elected prosecutor for Albermarle County, has filed for a retraining order against David Cosgrove, claiming that the St Louis lawyer harassed her after they split in August.

Lunsford, who has been in a lengthy relationship with another man despite her illicit meetings with Cosgrove over an 11-month period, claimed she did not even know the images had been taken.

Cosgrove has countered that she not only knew the photographs had been taken, but she even went through the pictures to delete the most unflattering and keep the best ones.

In court: Missouri lawyer David Cosgrove, left, allegedly posted nude images of Virginia prosecutor Denise Lunsford on Twitter after they broke up earlier this year. She is filing for a restraining order

She has asked that Cosgrove be 
required to stay away from her, stop communicating with her and stop 
posting her image or name on social media. A hearing is scheduled for 
October 3.

In her complaint,
Lunsford said she and Cosgrove dated in the late 1980s while attending 
Washington & Lee School of Law and rekindled the relationship last 
September.

After the relationship began again, they had
a dozen romantic rendezvous in various cities including Louisville, 
Lexington, Washington, D.C., and on Captiva Island, Florida.

NBC 29 reported that the meetings came even though she is in a 'longstanding relationship' with another man in Virginia. The couple is not married.

Lunsford said that when the most 
recent relationship ended, Cosgrove posted nude photos of her on his 
Twitter account, which have since been removed. They were not included 
in court documents.

Lunsford, 49, said she was unaware that most of the photos had been taken.

Accused: Cosgrove allegedly shared the images on Twitter, but they have since been deleted. Lunsford said she was not even aware of them being taken but Cosgrove has argued that she edited them

She added that Cosgrove phoned, texted and emailed her so much after their relationship ended that she had to change her phone number.

Her St. Louis County attorney, Susan Roach, said he also started posting other disturbing images such as one of a bloodied female figure.

Questionable: Cosgrove accused Lunsford of staying friends with Albemarle County supervisor Chris Dumler after he'd been charged with forcible sodomy

'I can't think of anything too much more unsettling,' Roach said. 'I think it's very disturbing.'

Neither Cosgrove nor his attorney, Michael Downey, responded to phone messages left Wednesday seeking comment. But in his response to the Lunsford's filing, Cosgrove called the allegations baseless and said he would seek sanctions against her and Roach.

Cosgrove said in his response that Lunsford knew he took the nude and semi-nude photos of her that he posted online and even went through the images to delete the most unflattering ones.

He accuses Lunsford of abusing the protective order process by trying to use it to punish him and to protect her political ambitions.

The documents from Cosgrove also accuse his former flame of continuing a friendship with former Albemarle County supervisor Chris Dumler after he'd been charged with forcible sodomy.

He claims that Lunsford even invited Dumler and his girlfriend to her home, where they watched an R-rated movie with Lunsford and her children - calling into question her professional ethics, he said.

Cosgrove was once former Governor Bob Holden's chief legal counsel.

He was also an assistant attorney general in Missouri from 1993 to 1999, then worked for three years as chief consumer protection prosecutor for the Massachusetts Attorney General's office, according to his law firm's website.

Lunsford was elected Albemarle County Commonwealth's attorney in 2007 and re-elected in 2011. The county, which includes Charlottesville, is about 115 miles southwest of Washington, D.C.
