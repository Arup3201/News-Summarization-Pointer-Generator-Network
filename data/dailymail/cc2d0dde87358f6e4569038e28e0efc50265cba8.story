A huge recovery mission was underway tonight after a Cambodian air force helicopter crashed into a flooded rice field, killing all on board.

Two generals who led the force's helicopter unit and two pilots died in the crash, which happened in a village around six miles south of the capital Phnom Penh this morning.

Cambodia's defence minister Tea Banh, who rushed to 
the crash site in a muddy lake surrounded by rural land and rice fields, said a fifth person
who had been on board the aircraft was seriously injured.

General
 Um Phy, deputy chief of staff of Cambodia's air force, confirmed the 
casualty count and said the aircraft was a Chinese-made Z-9 helicopter. 
Authorities had previously said five people were killed.

It
 was not immediately clear what caused the accident, which police said had occurred during a training mission for new pilots.

More than six hours after the 
crash, only two bodies had been recovered, and divers were still
 looking for the other two.

According to Phnom Penh deputy police chief Chuon Nari, one of the dead men was a major general while the other was a  brigadier general.

An incident report filed by police at the scene said the generals were the commander and deputy commander of the helicopter unit, and the other two men were pilots. Military officials confirmed the men's ranks, but not their positions. The survivor has not yet been identified.

Defense Ministry Secretary of State Moeung Samphan said 300 military personnel were sent to take part in the recovery operation.

Chhay Bunna, chief of police at Phnom Penh's nearby international airport, said the flight had been a training exercise, while Tea Banh said the area where the crash took place has been used for similar purposes for several years without incident.

One witness said she saw helicopters flying the same route almost every day, but the doomed flight seemed to be flying lower than usual, and had almost struck her house in Prey Sar village.

Ath Neang, 48, who lives just a few yards from the small lake, said that as one of the craft's rotor blades hit the bank, one man jumped out into the water.

At about the same time, she heard what sounded like an explosion from the aircraft, which then sank in the murky water.
