Tom Daley will return to England later on Tuesday after his unexpected grounding in Russia.

The English diver was returning from an event in Shanghai ahead of the Commonwealth Games when he and his partner were among 301 people who were forced to land in the Siberian city of Irkutsk.

Their Virgin Atlantic Airbus A340 had a 'technical issue' which Daley made known when he tweeted about it to his 2.5 million followers.
