Snapchat’s founders have quietly announced that they have settled a long-standing lawsuit with a former colleague, while all eyes were on the launch of Apple’s iPhone 6.

Chief Executive Evan Spiegel and Chief Technology Officer Robert Murphy acknowledged that their former fraternity brother, Frank Reginald Brown IV, was integral to the birth of their popular app, where 700 million disappearing messages are sent every day.

The settlement comes just a fortnight after Snapchat was valued at £6 billion ($10 billion).

Negotiations have been going on for a year-and-a-half.

Mr Brown originally came up with the idea for Snapchat – which sends disappearing photos – in 2011 when the three men were at Stanford University.

‘He then collaborated with Spiegel and Murphy on the development of Snapchat during its early and most formative days,’ a statement issued by Snapchat explains. 

But Mr Brown was later ousted and has been pushing for a favourable settlement.

The final settlement resolves all disputes between the former students and is confidential, but a statement put out by Snapchat acknowledges that Mr Brown came up with the concept for the app.

‘Reggie Brown originally came up with the idea of creating an application for sending disappearing picture messages while he was a student at Stanford University,’ the statement reads.

Instagram recently launched a new ephemeral messaging app called Bolt to compete with Snapchat

The app, which functions in a similar way to Snapchat, allows users to quickly share self destructing photos or videos with a friend.

Like Snapchat, the user can tap on a friend's face to instantly send a photo, or hold their finger down to send a video.

However, Bolt only allows you to send messages to one person at a time, which makes it frustrating if you’re looking to distribute photos or videos to a group of friends.

The favourites bar at the bottom of the app also only contains four friends, though you can apparently add up to 20 contacts in total.

Bolt is currently only available in New Zealand, Singapore, and South Africa.

Mr Spiegel said: ‘We are pleased that we have been able to resolve this matter in a manner that is satisfactory to Mr Brown and the Company.

‘We acknowledge Reggie’s contribution to the creation of Snapchat and appreciate his work in getting the application off the ground.’

In August last year, Mr Brown unearthed photos, emails and other 'evidence' in a bid to prove he was an integral part of Snapchat's success, but the other founders claimed he had 'no equity' in the venture.

It was reported at the time that he was suing the company for a third of its $800 million (£496 million) valuation.

Only the individuals involved know the financial outcome of the settlement, so it is impossible to speculate whether Mr Brown received this figure, something lower, or a much higher settlement based on the company's soaring valuation.

Mr Brown claimed he came up with the ghost logo and the original name, Picaboo, which the trio used in the launch of July that year.

But the friends are said to have fallen out a month before Snapchat launched, arguably making Mr Brown's role in the success of the final product slightly ambiguous.

Last year Snapchat turned down a £1.8 billion ($3 billion) offer from Facebook, and while some doubted the app could grow further, the company was valued at a staggering £6 billion (£10 billion) two weeks ago.

In a recent round of funding, investors promised millions to the company, including Venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byer, leading to the huge valuation, The Wall Street Journal reported.

The venture-capital firm had committed to invest up to £12 million ($20 million) in Snapchat in May, the Journal cited one source as saying.

If the deal goes through, Snapchat would join a select club of tech startups with valuations of £6 billion ($10 billion) or more, including car-ride service Uber and rooms-to-let startup AirBnB.

Snapchat is expected to soon begin offering advertising or branch out into additional services, which may include the ability to send instant money transfers to other users. It has also been rumoured that it may feature some sort of news service.

This week it has debuted a new feature for New York Fashion Week, featuring 'a live story' with material from the Marc Jacobs and Pamella Roland shows and street style photographers.

Though Snapchat and other similar mobile messaging apps don't have established business models yet, their rapid user growth and perceptions of advertising potential have aroused intense investor interest over the past year or so.

While
 the final settlement, which resolves all disputes between the former 
students, is confidential, a statement put out by Snapchat acknowledges 
that Brown came up with the concept for the app.

Snapchat's humble beginnings began in a home in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles in 2011, Business Insider reported in the summer of last year.

Mr Brown, an English major, decided to spend the summer there at the home of Mr Spiegel, his friend from Stanford University.

That is where Mr Brown is said to have come up with the idea for the disappearing photo app.

In the spring of 2013, Snapchat now admits in the suit, Mr Brown came up with the idea of a disappearing photo app. But that's where the two parties' stories part ways.

Mr Brown said that he and Mr Spigel looked for someone to write the code for their idea and chose Mr Murphy.

'From spring of 2011 and into the summer,' reads Brown's filing, '[Brown] and Spiegel and Murphy lived, worked, developed and launched the Application together.'

A saved text conversation between Mr Brown and Mr Spiegel seems to back the claim and suggests that Mr Brown helped to secure the company's first patent, while another suggests the would-be app was a three man startup.

In the summer of 2011, things went sour between Mr Spiegel, Mr Murphy and Mr Brown, when the now famous startup founders reportedly changed the passwords to shut Mr Brown out.

Last year, Mr Brown claimed that he came up with the ghost logo and the original name, Picaboo, which the trio used in the launch of July that year.
