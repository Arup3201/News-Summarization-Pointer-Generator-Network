Last summer, for a party at home in Devon, we thought it would be fun to make an earth oven where you dig a hole in the garden, light a fire and cook meat — in this case, lamb — in the ground.

But by 7pm, it was clear the meat wasn’t cooking quickly enough. Already, the children were starting to go rogue. I had lots of mouths to feed, but nothing to put on plates. If my guests weren’t going to go home hungry, I’d have to do something quickly.

I rushed to my larder and breathed a sigh of relief. There on the shelves were enough ingredients to feed the five thousand. Indeed, my sister Sofie always jokes that we could survive a nuclear winter with the contents of my larder.

Kirstie Allsopp (pictured) says her well-stocked larder is the pride of her home, and even had a bespoke larder specially made after discovering her second home didn't come with one already built-in

I’m not saying it was something Jamie Oliver would have been proud to put his name to, but from a range of foods that included tomatoes, flour, milk, cheese, pine nuts and chilli oil, I made three types of sauces and served them with pasta. No one went hungry. My larder had saved the day.

According to research, the larder has come back in from the cold. John Lewis say that half of their customers shopping for new kitchens want to integrate a larder into their design.

Last week, David Cameron was photographed preparing a meal in his kitchen at Downing Street. Next to his super-huge fridge was a modest but perfectly formed larder, stocked with everything from Marmite to mango chutney.

Some say the resurgence is thanks to Downton Abbey, with inspirational scenes of Mrs Patmore and assistant cook Daisy in their larder.

Indeed, the very word ‘larder’ makes you think of the cavernous cold rooms found in stately homes such as Highclere Castle (where Downton is filmed), which traditionally were bursting with salted meat, pickles, preserves and fresh bread.

But you’ve never had to be a lord to own a larder. In the Fifties, even the most modest new-build would have had a walk-in space at the back of the kitchen where food was stored.

There was wall-to-floor shelving and often a marble shelf to keep food such as butter and cheese as chilled as possible.

Kitchen suppliers and property agents have reported that more buyers are now looking for built-in larders like Kirstie's (pictured). 'A good larder can even add value to a property,' says the TV presenter

It was the arrival of the fridge in the mid-Fifties that dampened our ardour for the larder. Though the first ones cost the equivalent of £4,500 in today’s money, as prices came down and more people were able to afford one, larders went out of fashion.

And that’s a shame. In the U.S., where summers are baking hot, I can see why the fridge is a necessity. But in our damp, cold climate, do we really need quite so much of our food kept at temperatures close to freezing?

The simple answer is ‘No’. Unless we’re in the middle of a heatwave, most food can be kept for several days in the dark, cool climate of a larder.

Eggs, for instance, should keep beautifully fresh for several weeks in a cool larder. Tomatoes taste infinitely better straight from the larder, as do avocados, bananas, apples and oranges.

I don’t keep any of my jams, pickles or sauces in the fridge: I don’t want chilled jam on my toast.

I don’t even keep my cheese in the fridge, particularly runny French varieties.

Health and safety would say I’m endangering the health of my family — but I haven’t poisoned anyone yet.

To be honest, my larder is one of my favourite things in our home.

There was already a larder in our house in Devon, so when we moved into our second house in West London nine years ago, I had one built into the kitchen.

It’s 5ft by 6ft, with four deep shelves around three of the walls. It has a wine rack and spice rack, as well as a free-standing rack for veg. True to tradition, there’s a marble shelf and a small window, which we keep open.

My partner Ben hated it and wanted me to knock it down as soon as he saw it. I stood my ground, and he now admits it’s one of the great triumphs in the house.

To start with, I confess, my use of the shelves was pretty chaotic. But a few years ago, while we were on holiday, our super-organised nanny Heather rearranged all the shelves.

She bought dozens of containers and jars from Lakeland and transformed that little room.

Now, I’m a slave to its military precision. Sometimes, I’ll go in and just stand there, admiring the neatly lined-up packets and jars. I took a picture of it at its tidiest and attached it to the door, with a note: ‘PLEASE KEEP THE LARDER THIS WAY!’

As we only have two cupboards in our entire kitchen, it’s not just food that we keep in the larder. Our medicines, alcohol, mixers, Tupperware, picnic stuff and Thermos flasks are stored there, too.

Kirstie reveals that she now only has two storage cupboards in her kitchen (pictured), instead storing everything from spices and sauces to alcohol, medicines, Tupperwear and picnic sets in her beloved larder

The only things we don’t keep in it are chemicals for cleaning and washing.

We do own a fridge. In fact, we recently got our first new fridge. (Ben is a property developer, so we’ve always had hand-me-down fridges.) But while most people’s fridges are bursting at the seams, if you open the door to ours, it looks as if we haven’t shopped for a month.

So, why do I love my larder so much? Well, not only does food taste better, there’s also far less waste.

We’re a shockingly profligate nation, throwing a third of the fresh food we buy. I wonder how much of this is due to our groceries getting ‘lost’ at the back of a crammed fridge?

It’s so much more convenient to walk into a single small area and see exactly what items you have at a glance.

'Unless we’re in the middle of a heatwave, most food can be kept for several days in the dark, cool climate of a larder,' says Kirstie (pictured in her kitchen) 

My TV colleague Phil Spencer says he’s noticed an increase in buyers asking for a larder when searching for property. That doesn’t surprise me. There’s something about a larder that appeals to our emotions to do with providing for our family.

Though I’m not a hoarder when it comes to things like clothes, there’s something reassuring about seeing enough pasta, rice and even medicines on the shelves to know that if the shops all shut tomorrow, and civilisation collapsed, I could feed my family for a while longer.

A larder is more ecological, too. These awful American monolith fridges use an extortionate amount of energy, while even the average fridge uses two units of electric power per hour — enough to run a small TV for 20 hours.

But a larder, well, apart from a light switch, it’s energy free. What’s more, it adds value to the house — though it’s hard to say precisely how much.

But this isn’t about money. I’ve always said that a house only works if the kitchen works — and for me, the larder is the secret of a truly successful kitchen. I wouldn’t be without mine.

Love It Or List It, presented by Kirstie Allsopp & Phil Spencer, starts on Channel 4 in April.
