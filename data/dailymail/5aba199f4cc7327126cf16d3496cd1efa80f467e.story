At the blood-soaked Iowa crime scene of the Copper Dollar Ranch murders on March 3, 1983, investigators described the unconscionable slayings of Steven Fisher, 20, and his girlfriend Melisa Gregory, 17, 'a crime of passion'.

Bludgeoned to death with a claw hammer, the bodies of the couple were so badly disfigured police initially thought they had been repeatedly shot in the head.

But the case remained cold until now, 31 years to the day, with Fisher's estranged wife, Theresa 'Terri' Supino, 53, charged with the double homicide.

Police are said to have knocked down the door of Supino's home in the Des Moines suburb of Altoona and charged her with two counts of first-degree murder on March 3 - the anniversary of the killings.

Officials have refused to reveal the new break that lead to Supino's arrest, only saying that it came after hundreds of interviews and the continued process of evidence.

According to WHOtv.com, a national TV show that investigates cold cases was taping in the town a few weeks ago.

A reporter at the network also said she had recently moved out of her Altoona apartment and quit her job at the buffet restaurant Pizza Ranch.

Supino and Fisher had two children together and were still married at the time of his death, however they had separated.

Fisher had started stating Gregory, who he worked with at the at the Copper Dollar Ranch, a horse ranch about four miles northwest of Newton.

On March 2, 1983, the pair had spent the night together at the ranch in a trailer Fisher had been living in.

The next day a co-worker found their brutally-beaten bodies just before 8am.

Fisher was found lying face down near the barn, wearing only blue jeans.

Gregory was inside the trailer about 50 meters away.

Terri Supino was married to 20-year-old Steven Fisher though they were separated. Fisher and his girlfriend, 17-year-old Melisa Gregory,were found dead on March 3, 1983 at the ranch were Fisher worked in Jasper County. Supino has now been charged with their murders

The gruesome murders rocked the tiny town, however police said that while they had a suspect, there was not enough evidence to arrest them.

An FBI profiler called in to help with the investigation called the case a 'crime of passion' that was 'up close and personal' and done by someone 'who was angry'.

According to BethBardner.com, with all the time that has passed, many people, including family members of Melisa Gregory, had long ago decided Supino was innocent.

Today Fox News reported that, in a written statement, Jasper County Sheriff John Halferty their investigation was still far from over and urged people with additional information to come forward.

'In the 31 years since the deaths of Steven and Melisa, the deputies, officers, agents, criminalists and many others have remained dedicated to assuring this case was never forgotten,' he said.

Halferty told the Newton Daily News he started looking into the cold case in 2003.

He said he knew Gregory from junior high school and that her murder had always been in the back of his mind.

He started 'digging into' the case when he was in a position to do so.

'I was new to junior high and I just remember how friendly she was to me,' Halferty said at a vigil last year.

'I live with that memory, and Iâ€™m in a position now where I think it is time.

'There are people locally that can help us with this case, and weâ€™re asking you to come forward and talk to us.'

Supino was being held at the Jasper County Jail in Newton on a $400,000 bond.
