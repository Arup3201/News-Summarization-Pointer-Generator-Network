A 17-year-old was able to safely escape from his car after a collision sent the vehicle teetering over the edge of a bridge - but he couldn't get out of a traffic citation.

Colin Malone was driving over the Sagamore Bridge in Nashua, New Hampshire around 3.30pm on Saturday when he lost control of his Honda Accord and hit a snowbank on the shoulder of the highway.

The collision sent the car flying into the air before it landed on the guardrail above the Merrimack River, according to a statement from New Hampshire State Police.

The car landed on the guardrail above the Merrimack River, it's rear hanging over the 75ft drop. Malone was able to escape the car safely, but was cited by police for failing to keep his car within roadway markings

Malone was given a highway markings citation after police determined he had failed to keep his car within roadway markings.
