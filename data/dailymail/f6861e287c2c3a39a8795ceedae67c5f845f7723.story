There would be no more symbolic sight than Moeen Ali walking down the pavilion steps at Lord’s next month to make his Test debut for England. It would be a triumph for modern society as well as this hugely talented cricketer.

Moeen knows that if that day comes — and there is every chance England will pick him to be their all-rounder against Sri Lanka — he will initially gain as much attention for his physical appearance as his wristy batting and attacking off-spin.

That is fine by him. For, with his luxuriant beard to the fore, he wants to be a role model not just for the Muslim community but any young cricketer treading the same path that he did growing up in multi-cultural Birmingham. We have returned to the area in the east of England’s second city where Moeen emerged from a quite extra-ordinary British Asian family. We are here for a StreetChance coaching session and the kids are hanging on his every word.

Foot in the door: Moeen Ali hopes to make his Test debut for England against Sri Lanka next month

A tape-ball (a tennis ball wrapped in tape to give it more weight) is used in the playground of the Hodge Hill Sports and Enterprise College, just as it was in the back garden arena that his father and uncle, twins who married sisters, set up for him and his cricketing brothers and cousins. This is about showing that anyone from any background can enjoy cricket.

‘We all played in my family and cricket has always been in the blood,’ said Moeen before joining up with the England Twenty20 squad for their match against Sri Lanka at The Kia Oval on Tuesday. 

‘We didn’t really worry about education because we all thought we would end up playing cricket. I think my dad always believed I would play for  England, probably more than I believed it, but it never crossed our minds that we weren’t going to make it.’ 

The aspiration was always to play for England. Moeen is as proud to come from Birmingham, as he is of following Islam. ‘A lot of Asians I’ve met have said, “Why don’t you play for Pakistan?”, but for me it was always about playing for England,’ he said.

'My job as a Muslim is to change all the negativity about Islam'

‘This is my country, this is where I was born. I was saying to (England captain) Alastair Cook the other day that as soon as I land or drive into Birmingham I feel at home. No matter where I’ve been in the world. It’s really special. I like to see the kids in my area wearing England shirts, not Pakistan or India ones. A lot of it comes from the older generations but it’s changing slowly, especially if people like myself and Ravi Bopara are playing for England. I would like to see that change a bit more.’ 

The beard that is an outward sign of his faith is as important to him as his background. ‘I wear the beard as a label,’ he said. ‘Religion is very important to me. One of my aims is to try to show that you can have faith and play cricket. There can be a lot of negativity and misunderstanding of Islam. 

‘I feel my job as a Muslim is to change that and show people what my faith is really like. A lot of what is said and written is ridiculous but that’s life. I just get on with it and try to be as positive as I can.’

In the swing: Ali in action for Worcestershire

Those aims stretch to encouraging British Asians to be more inclusive themselves. For Moeen, who named his son born last year Abu Bakr in honour of the first man to accept Islam, believes that they can be as much at fault as traditional English clubs for sometimes not opening their doors to all races.

‘A kid came up to me and said, “Can you recommend a club where I won’t experience racism?”. I told him, “Every club”. People use race and religion as an excuse. I can honestly say there are no barriers if you work hard.

‘I don’t think there’s any prejudice. My club, Moseley Ashfield, welcomed us with open arms and was a great place for a young player to go and learn. It can work both ways. A lot of Asians need to be a bit more open to going out there and giving it a crack rather than having some sort of problem joining a club. They can perhaps presume  prejudice when it isn’t there.’ 

Moeen insists he has never experienced racism during his career with Warwickshire, Worcestershire and now England. ‘People outside cricket might be surprised just how accommodating every team I’ve played in have been,’ he said. ‘I was really surprised how nice and understanding everyone is. Worcestershire have been unbelievable, which is one of the reasons why I signed long-term. When it’s time to pray they let me and when I need to do stuff, I do it.

‘I’ve never once experienced racism from any other player. You experience ignorance but that’s not the same thing at all and I’m always willing to discuss things. If that helps people learn that there’s nothing to fear from Islam that’s great. I can show these kids here today that you don’t have to change to fit in.’ 

The predominantly Asian children taking part in the StreetChance session love every minute of their time with Moeen.

Values: Ali's beard is a sign that he is very religious and he wants to change views on Islam

‘My aim is just to try to inspire them to play, even if it is just one kid out there — to try to get them to push themselves and to show them it’s not impossible to do very well at the game.

‘Even when you see someone on TV it’s not quite the same as seeing them in the flesh at something like this. I can meet people and tell them that I came from exactly the same background and did exactly the same things as them at school. I remember Warwickshire’s Asif Din coming to my school and I thought, “This is what I want to do. I want to play cricket”. That’s the message I want to get across.’ 

It is a message he can get across even more if he plays at Lord’s on June 12. If he does, then watch out for the new mystery spin delivery he has been working on with Saeed Ajmal, a master of the art, at New Road.

‘Saeed is teaching me a few tricks,’ he said. ‘I’ve been working with him and soon I will be ready to show my skills. I’d like to be the first England player to bowl the doosra (a delivery that spins in the opposite direction to the off-break, the off-spinner’s default ball). I’m not far away. I just need to reach the point where I know exactly what’s going to happen when I bowl it. It’s coming out nicely.’

In a spin: Pakistan's Saeed Ajmal, pictured playing for Worcestershire, has helped Ali with his bowling

Moeen, who, at nearly 27, has learnt his craft in county cricket, believes there is as much suspicion in England about mystery spin as about Islam.

‘Everybody is bowling it now apart from us but every young off-spinner in this country should be taught how to bowl a doosra,’ said Moeen. ‘It’s happened in other countries for a long time now but we always seem to have a problem with it and somehow feel it’s going to destroy our spinners. We never seem open to these kind of things but we will have to be and I think we are slowly realising that people can’t just bowl orthodox off-spin any more. 

‘Our batsmen always struggle against mystery — everybody does — and you have to have it these days or you’re not going to last too long.

‘There are so many different actions out there with people who have kinks and I don’t see why I can’t get away with it. I have asked a lot of people and 95 per cent who have watched me have said they think my action is legal when I bowl it. I’m going to do it anyway and if the umpires call me for throwing they will call me. We shouldn’t be scared of it any more.’ 

He is an inspiring figure in more ways than one.

Moeen Ali was coaching at a ‘StreetChance supported by Barclays Spaces for Sports’ session. Barclays supports programmes such as StreetChance as part of its 5 Million Young Futures commitment to provide the next generation with the skills they need to fulfil their potential.
