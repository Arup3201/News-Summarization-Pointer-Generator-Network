With new phones being released almost monthly, signing up to a 24-month contract for one particular handset can be a gamble, and getting out of contracts can work out more expensive than buying a brand new handset out right.

To tackle this problem, network operator EE has launched its Swap scheme that lets customers upgrade to a new device just six months into an 18-month or two-year contract, and pay just a one-off fee.

Swap is available to customers already on 4GEE, Orange and T-Mobile plans and after six months they can return their device and get an upgrade to a brand new phone on a 24-month contract on 4GEE.

Britain's first 4G network, run by EE, launches today -but has come under fire for its high prices

Then, if within the next six months a better phone comes out, they can swap again.

The amount a customer pays as a one-off fee depends on which contract they are on.

For example, people who currently have a £51 per month 4GEE contract will pay just £49 to break the contract and upgrade to a new phone and plan.

If the same customer, on a 24-month plan, had to pay off the rest of their contract after six months they would pay £918.

The most expensive example given by EE was for customers on a £36 per month 4GEE.

To upgrade through the Swap scheme they would have to pay £249, compared to buying out their contract for £648.

EE's Swap scheme applies to existing 4GEE, Orange and T-Mobile customers.

Plans can be upgraded after six months for a one-off fee.

If within the next six months a better phone comes out, they can swap again.

The amount a customer pays as a one-off fee depends on which contract they are on.

On Phones4U Jump, the customer pays one monthly amount for the handset and services, called the Jump payment, and a separate monthly amount for the 'network airtime agreement'.

The Jump agreement can be upgraded after six months.

The amount a customer will pay to Jump varies by handset and contract.

O2's Refresh service lets existing customers upgrade their handsets before the end of their contract.

Refresh contracts are split in two and customers pay a phone plan and a network plan.

Customers can upgrade at any time.

Then when it comes to upgrading, O2 lets customers pay off just their phone plan, and not their airtime plan.

According to the terms and conditions, customers must already have a device on an eligible plan.

The phone must also be 'in good working order, with no significant dents, scratches, or cracks on the screen.'

EE's Swap scheme is similar to Phones4U's Jump tariff that splits contract agreements into two.

The customer pays one monthly amount for the handset and services, called the Jump payment, and then a separate monthly amount for the 'network airtime agreement'.

With Apple poised to launch a new handset, customers with the iPhone 5, pictured, could upgrade after just six months with EE Swap

They can then upgrade their Jump agreement after six months, while the network agreement stays the same.

The amount a customer will pay to Jump varies by handset and contract. 

Network provider O2's Refresh service also lets customers upgrade their handsets before the end of their contract and similarly splits the agreement into two.

However, on O2 Refresh customers can upgrade at any point.

When the time comes to upgrade, O2 lets customers then pay off just their phone plan, and not their airtime plan.

For example, after five months of a two-year, £32-a-month O2 Refresh contract the customer pays £285 to upgrade, rather than £608 with other operators.

Ernest Doku, mobiles expert at uSwitch.com, told MailOnline: 'Being able to move into the mobile fast lane for a one-off fee could be the offer many consumers need to make the switch.

'Buying your way out of a contract has never been easy or cheap, but this scheme keeps things straightforward.

'However, tying the one-off fee into the tariff type could prove to be a blessing and a curse.

'Customers looking to move just six months into a 24-month contract will be the winners, whereas those in sight of the finish line may feel hard done by.

'But it’s hard to keep everyone happy, and what EE has done is simplify the process and 'swap' could give those EE customers with a phone in good condition the chance to enjoy 4G without the hefty outlay they may have feared.'
