Admission: Clive Goodman (pictured today) said he had hacked the royals while working at the tabloid

Disgraced former royal reporter Clive 
Goodman hacked Kate Middleton’s phones 155 times in eight months, he 
admitted for the first time yesterday.

The former News of the World royal 
editor hacked Miss Middleton – now the Duchess of Cambridge – on an 
almost daily basis, including on Christmas Day.

He also frequently intercepted the voicemails of Princes William and Harry.

Goodman, who was jailed for hacking 
mobiles belonging to royal aides in 2007, said he had not previously 
told police or prosecutors about the true extent of his hacking because 
he was never asked about it.

The 56-year-old told the phone hacking
 trial he targeted the young royals in 2005 and 2006 and continued to 
hack Miss Middleton until the day before his arrest in August 2006.

He hacked Prince William 35 times and 
Prince Harry nine times and also targeted royal aides, including the 
Duchess of York’s press aide Kate Waddington and Prince Charles’s former
 valet Michael Fawcett.

He insisted he would have told police about the full extent of the hacking operation if he had been asked.

Goodman, a married father of one, was
 jailed for four months in 2007 after he admitted his part in hacking 
William and Harry’s PA Helen Asprey, their private secretary Jamie 
Lowther- Pinkerton and their Press aide Paddy Harverson.

Private detective Glenn Mulcaire was jailed for six months.

Goodman said the editor of the News of
 the World at the time, Andy Coulson, knew about the hacking and 
sanctioned £500-a-week payments to Mulcaire to target the royals.

Timothy Langdale QC, for Coulson, 
confronted Goodman with phone data which showed he had personally hacked
 William, Kate and Harry.

Goodman said: ‘I am not on trial for 
phone hacking. I completely agree I hacked these people’s phones.

Allegations: Kate Middleton and Prince William on the day of their graduation at St Andrew's University in June 2005. The Duchess was said in court to have been first hacked in December that year by Goodman

'I have
 never been asked by any inquiry or investigation about this.

'Now you’re asking me about them, I’m quite happy to answer and get everything out in the open.’

The jury has previously heard that the
 Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into phone hacking at the
 News of the World after the Royal Household raised the alarm.

Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC, told the 
jurors the 2006 investigation was more limited than the later police 
inquiry, Operation Weeting, launched in 2011.

Goodman, of Addlestone, Surrey, said 
he first targeted Miss Middleton amid speculation her relationship with 
Prince William was becoming more serious, and that Mulcaire had provided
 her phone details.

He told the Old Bailey: ‘I’m really 
not the slightest bit proud of this.

Trial: Goodman returned to the hacking trial of former editors Rebekah Brooks (left), Andy Coulson (right) and five others to finish giving his evidence after he fell ill on March 21. All seven defendants deny the charges

'I don’t want anyone to think I’m 
not ashamed of what we did but the fact of the matter was we did it and 
I’m trying to tell the truth about it.’

The journalist said Mulcaire’s role at
 the News of the World was well known at the paper, adding: ‘Virtually 
every story that went through the paper was ground through Glenn 
Mulcaire’s phone hacking mill.’

Coulson, 45, and Goodman both deny conspiracy to commit misconduct by paying public officials for Palace phone directories.

Coulson and former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks both deny conspiracy to hack phones.

The trial continues.
