England full-back Ben Foden enjoyed the perfect preparation for this year's Aviva Premiership season, relaxing with his family at a luxury resort in Jamaica.

Foden, who is married to Saturdays star Una, has played all five of Northampton's games this season, scoring one try as the Saints have raced to the top of the table.

But he proved, over the off-season, that he is as accomplished in the kareoke booth as on the pitch, wowing his pop-star wife with a rendition of John Legend's 'All of Me'.

Una, writing in the Mail on Sunday, has spoken all about the luxury holiday which the couple took with their daughter Aoife, including Ben's 'really good' singing performance. 

'When it came to karaoke night, it was perhaps inevitable that I was encouraged to get up and perform. I managed to resist,' she wrote. 'Ben, however, needed no second invitation.'

'One night, after enjoying a few drinks, he headed towards the stage and sang John Legend’s All Of Me. Before he started, he told the crowd: "This one’s for Una!" I was cringeing but I have to say he did a really good job.'
