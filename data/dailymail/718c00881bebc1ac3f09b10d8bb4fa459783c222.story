With her glossy, chestnut ponytail swishing to and fro, I spotted her furtively racing down the sparkling new ALDI shopping aisles, her slim, manicured hands greedily fumbling towards the coffee pods and water crackers. 

Here was the undisputed yummy-mummy queen of my son's little local public school, trying to go unnoticed.

With a look as determined and stealthy as the engine of her $70,000 Volvo XC90 parked outside, this was clearly a 'shop-but-for-god's-sake-don't-be-seen' mission.

Lucie Morris-Marr put the new ALDI store in Melbourne to the test and it came up trumphs, saving more than $20 compared with the same shop at Coles

ALDI opened it's latest $6 million store in one of Melbourne's most exclusive beach suburbs, Cheltenham

Around 200 shoppers burst through the doors of the brand new purpose built ALDI store on Wednesday morning in the exclusive area of Bayside, Melbourne

Like the 200 shoppers who burst through the doors of this brand new purpose built ALDI store that opened at 8.30am on Wednesday morning in the exclusive area of Bayside, Melbourne, this middle-class Australian mother is very excited about this unstoppable German supermarket giant.

In their on-going bid to boldly wade into a market dominated so long and loudly by Coles and Woolworths, ALDI are purposing wooing more and more middle-class Australians through their doors.

And it's working.

(SAVINGS OVER A YEAR SHOPPING FOR A WHOLE YEAR AT ALDI INSTEAD OF COLES :$1,177.28)

After only entering Australia 13 years ago, the chain now has more than 10.3 per cent of the grocery market on the eastern ­seaboard, with more than 350 stores and annual sales of $5.3 billion. 

Yes, you read it right - that's $5.3 billion for a supermarket so weird and wonderful that somehow you can easily emerge with a $6 hula-hoop for your pre-schooler when all you went in for was a sandwich loaf.

But what was remarkable was how by 9.20am this morning each one of the 136 parking spaces were filled outside the new store on Bay Road, Cheltenham, near the uber-wealthy neighbouring suburbs of Sandringham, Hampton and Brighton.

Putting ALDI'S latest shopping experience to the test, Daily Mail Australia sent me to do a shop here to see if this new store will get me hooked, knowing that I can be a snobby beast when it comes to food shopping.

The new Aldi store in Cheltenham was reviewed by Lucie Morris Marr

Bananas were $1.81/kg cheaper at ALDI compared with Coles

But some basic items at ALDI were a little more expensive including long grain rice which was $2.99 for a 2kg bag while at Coles it was $2.29

Because, I have to be honest, my previous experiences of ALDI stores haven't always been a delight. Far from it.

For a start there are no free carrier bags, no brands that I've known and loved all my life (e.g Heinz and Fairy Liquid) and you are most definitely not allowed to pack your shopping at the check out. Don't even think about it!

In the past, it's at this point I usually weep silently, wishing I'd just re-mortgaged the house and shopped at Thomas Dux where you float off feeling like a better person - not a mother slipping towards the edge of sanity.

But the first thing that strikes me as I walk into the doors of this flagship new store, is the sense of space. Yes, ALDI have gone all trendy here with a hint of minimalist at last. Whisper it quietly, it's almost IKEA-like.

These were the products at the ALDI store that were price matched. The ALDI total came in at more than $20 less compared with the same shop at Coles

After doing a shop of 26 daily basic daily items at ALDI totalling $74.13, Lucie then drove two kilometres up the road to the nearest Coles at Southland, Cheltenham, where the exact same items came to a whopping $96.77 in comparison

'The store say they are able to offer cheap prices by cutting down on overheads, using reusable crates and not giving out free plastic bags,' said Lucie

You can see what their game is, in their bid to get fussy mums like me onside, with their organic ranges, exposed pale wood beams, jaunty metal tubes on the tall ceilings and most importantly space between the food and those famously bizarre 'Special Buys.'

Well done ALDI, for once the proximity between your cheap camping gear and boogie boards, are far enough away for me to safely manoeuvre towards the bananas without running anyone down. Let this be your future.

And of course for savvy middle-class shoppers, feeling the strain of the increasing costs of housing and basic utilities, it's all about the cheaper price points they boast about. But are their claims really true? It is, as it turns out.

After doing a shop of 26 daily basic daily items at ALDI totalling $74.13, I then drove two kilometres up the road to the nearest Coles at Southland, Cheltenham, where the exact same items came to a whopping $96.77 in comparison - by only using either their own brands or the cheapest on offer. 

'Well done ALDI, for once the proximity between your cheap camping gear and boogie boards, are far enough away for me to safely manoeuvre towards the bananas without running anyone down,' said Lucie

Most fresh fruit came in cheaper at ALDI when compared to Coles

While some items such as plain flour, bread, milk and tins of baked beans were in some cases exactly the same as ALDI, it was in the meat and cheese aisles where ALDI won handsomely.

Infact, there was a total saving of $22.64 by getting my basic items from ALDI which is a saving of a huge $1.117.28 over a whole year. That's a decent mini-break in a luxury hotel in my book. Take that Mr Dux!

It's not surprising ALDI plans to continue to try and take over the world, with their 9,600 stores in 18 countries.

They are investing between $400 million and $450 million in Western Australia and between $200 million and $300 million in South Australia over the next few years with the first stores in the states to open in 2016.

'Everything we do is designed to enable Australian shoppers to live richer lives for less,' an ALDI Australia spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.

'Yes, ALDI have gone all trendy here with a hint of minimalist at last,' said Lucie

Lucie Morris-Marr found that it was more than $20 cheaper to shop at ALDI compared to Coles for the same items

'In their bid to get fussy mums like me onside, with their organic ranges, exposed pale wood beams, jaunty metal tubes on the tall ceilings and most importantly space between the food and those famously bizarre 'Special Buys,' said Lucie

'Australians have come to love the business model of ALDI, now they have had a taste of what we can offer.'

The store say they are able to offer cheap prices by cutting down on overheads, using reusable crates and not giving out free plastic bags.

OK so yes, Coles and Woolworths stores are full of famous brands and they pack your bags for you. (Which is life-saving if your toddler is crying.) And you don't get tempted to buy a laptop with your washing up liquid.

But as I spied the school yummy mummy speeding off in her Volvo from ALDI, I knew one thing for certain. She may try to deny it. But she'll be back for the cheap free range chicken at least. And so will I.
