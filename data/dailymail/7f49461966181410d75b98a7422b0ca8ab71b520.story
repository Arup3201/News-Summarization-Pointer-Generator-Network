The keen eye of Nasa’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has spotted the Curiosity rover meandering towards a giant Martian mountain.

Its tracks can be seen in two separate images taken by the spacecraft’s High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on December 11 2013.

The images show where the rover has zigzagged around obstacles on its route toward the lower slopes of Mount Sharp, its next major destination.

The Curiosity Mars rover and tracks left by its driving appear in this portion of a December 11, 2013, image. The rover is near the lower-left corner of this view. For scale, the two parallel lines of the wheel tracks are about 3 metres (10 feet) apart

HiRISE first imaged the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft while it was descending on a parachute to place Curiosity on Mars 17 months ago.

Since then, it has provided updated views of the one-tonne rover's traverse, as seen from orbit.

In the first image, the rover is near the lower-left corner of this view. For scale, the two parallel lines of the wheel tracks are about 10 feet (3m) apart.

Two parallel tracks left by the wheels of the Curiosity Mars rover cross rugged ground. The image was taken by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter

The central panel of this graphic is a view from orbit that includes tracks of drives made by Nasa's Curiosity Mars rover in October to December of 2013.  The six images at left and right are rover's-eye views at the locations marked with yellow letters A through F on the central panel.  mage A is from Curiosity's rear Hazard-Avoidance Camera, Image C from the rover's Navigation Camera, images B, D, E and F from the rover's Mast Camera

Mount Sharp, also called Aeolis Mons, is a layered mound in the centre of Mars' Gale Crater, which rises more than 5km (3 miles).

The mountain exposes many layers where scientists anticipate finding evidence
 about how the ancient Martian environment changed and evolved.

Mission
 scientists want the Curiosity to climb up the mountain's lower reaches,
 reading a record of the red planet's changing environmental conditions 
as it goes.

A second image shows the Curiosity rover's tracks as seen by the orbiter spacecraft, but not the rover itself.

Curiosity arrived inside Mars' huge Gale Crater in late in 2012 with a mission to determine if the red planet could ever have supported life.

The mission has since accomplished its goal, when it uncovered an area near its landing site called Yellowknife Bay which was found to be habitable billions of years ago.

In July 2013, Curiosity rover left Yellowknife Bay and began heading for the base of Mount Sharp, which is about 5km (3 miles).

Mount Sharp, in the middle of Gale Crater, exposes many layers where scientists anticipate finding evidence about how the ancient Martian environment changed and evolved.

Scientists want the Curiosity to climb up the mountain's lower reaches, reading a record of the red planet's changing environmental on its way.

Curiosity is due to reach the Mount Sharp's foothills — which are around 8.6km (5.3 miles) from Yellowknife Bay — around the middle of this year.
