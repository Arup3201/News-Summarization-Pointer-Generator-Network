New images have emerged appearing to show the injuries a reality TV star has accused a tech tycoon of inflicting on her after she spent a weekend with him at the Sundance Film Festival.

Ariane Bellamar, known as one of the high-maintenance moms on now-cancelled reality show Beverly Hills Nannies, told Radar Online that Patrick Henry, the 51-year-old CEO of Entropic Communications, beat her up in a drunken fight following the festival in Park City, Utah.

The new images appear to show Bellamar with heavy bruising to her arms, legs and buttocks, and cuts to her left hand and lower back.

Bellamar says she met Henry after separating 
from real estate mogul Barry Pettitt in November. She entered the online
 dating pool and connected with the executive on MillionaireMatch.com.

When he asked her to be his date to Sundance, she agreed because 'he seemed normal' and mutual friends vouched for him.

She seemed to be having a great time when she posted a picture of the view from Utah on January 22. 'Park City is amazing!' she wrote.

But things allegedly took a turn on their second night out.

'He
 started doing shots...and became very jealous of the attention his 
friends were paying me,' Bellamar told Radar. 'I told him I wanted to 
leave [but] he did not. I took a cab back to the cabin, inadvertently 
locked the door behind me and went to bed.'

Happy start: On January 22, Bellamar posted a picture from Park City on her Facebook page. She says she agreed to go to the film festival with Henry even though she never met him in person

Took a turn: But just four days later she posted a more ominous message on her Facebook

The
 next thing she says she remembers is being woken up by Henry, dragging her by 
the hair into the garage. She claims he screamed at her and accused her of
 purposefully locking him out even though he had a key.

'He then proceeded to throw me multiple times into the concrete walls of the garage,' she said. 'I am bloodied and bruised all up and down my left side of my body and… right side. It was terrifying.'

Bellamar provided pictures of her injuries to Radar which show bruises covering her left arm, thigh and backside with scabs on her hands and broken nails. 

'After three tosses, I just laid 
freezing on the garage floor, begging him to allow me into the house ,' 
Bellamar said. 'I thought that I was going to freeze to death. I was 
still in my cocktail attire from the evening. He looked crazy.'

'As
 I was laying bloody on his garage floor, I thought “Oh my God, I’m 
going to die here.” This is what you see on TV. I am not that person,' 
she added to MailOnline.

Eventually Henry agreed to let her back in, and Bellamar says she then went to sit on the couch where she started crying, curled up in the fetal position.

Henry yelled at her to stop crying, picking her up and throwing her back into bed.

Bellamar continued to cry and shake 'uncontrollably', prompting Henry to rip off the covers and tell her to leave.

Bellamar says she was in so much pain and shock, she didn't even respond so Henry called the police saying she wouldn't leave.

She said the experience has been 'traumatizing' and 
that she cannot understand the domestic abuse 'as a woman or as a mother'. 

Abused: After returning from Utah, Bellamar went to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a 'stress reaction to a recent assault'

Four days after posting the picture from Henry's Park City home, she wrote a somber status on Facebook.

'Brutality against women never goes unpunished - never. You can run and/or try to hide, but it will catch up with you - always ... xo Peace Over Violence.'

Back in her home of Santa Barbara, Bellamar went to the hospital where discharge records show she was diagnosed with a 'stress reation to a recent assault' and that she suffered 'multiple strain, contusions and abrasions' including hand and shoulder sprains.

MailOnline's calls to the Summit County Sheriff's office were not immediately returned Tuesday afternoon, but Captain Justin Martinez told Radar that they were investigating the allegations but that no charges have been pressed.

Why? Bellamar told Radar she's having a hard time understanding the attack 'as a woman or as a mother'. Pictured with daughter Emma above.

After receiving requests for comment from Radar, Henry sent Bellamar two threatening text messages.

First he wrote: 'I got an email from RadarOnline about the incident at my home in Utah last week. I plan to ignore the inquiry. If you want to discuss, please let me know. As far as I'm concerned it is private. Let me know your thoughts. I can forward the email if you want.'

A few hours later, he sent yet another text: 'Keep in mind if you publicly disparage me, I will reveal the facts of the situation in defense of myself.'

MailOnline reached out to Henry's company for comment, but has not received a reply.

Following the attack, Bellamar is having trouble sleeping at night and has started seeing a therapist. 

She says her husband has been 'extraordinarily supportive' despite their separation.

Another challenge is explaining her injuries to her 5-year-old daughter.

'I
 tell her you’ve got to be careful about who you’re around and not to talk 
to strangers. At my age, I should have listened to my own advice,' she said.
