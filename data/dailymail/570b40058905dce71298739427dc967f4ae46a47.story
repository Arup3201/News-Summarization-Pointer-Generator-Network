For many men December is the worst time of year because it means one thing: Christmas shopping.

And this Christmas, Britain’s 12 million married men will waste up to 193 years of precious time if they decide to join spouses on shopping trips, waiting diligently outside changing rooms as wives turn the Christmas shop into an opportunity to treat themselves to some new clothes or shoes.

And according to the latest survey, an average woman takes one hour and 41 minutes to make up their mind before buying a pair of shoes or item of clothing.

Wasted time: Britain's 12 million married men will waste up to 193 years of precious time if they decide to join spouses on shopping trips

In December that equates to 1.7 million hours of so-called Lost Football Time (LFT) or 1.2 million 90-minute football matches.

With the busiest shopping day of the year forecast for 23 December, the survey calculated that 60,000 man hours will be lost by bored, bag-carrying men that day.

If men think it is bad enough joining their other halves on just one shopping trip a month, spare a thought for the partners of the fifth of women who admit they shop for clothes twice a month.

And it appears that the fruits of men's labours go to waste anyway, as more than half of women admit to
never wearing an average of six items of clothing and three pairs of 
shoes that are in their wardrobes.

That equates to a whopping 87 million items of clothing remaining unworn in the wardrobes of Britain’s 28.5 million women. 

The average purchase price of women's clothing is £25, which means an eye watering £2.1 billion is wasted on clothes.

Loaye Agabani, co-founder of 
MyHigh.St, who commissioned the study, said: 'Every day men sacrifice 
countless hours waiting for their partners to browse, select and make a 
purchase.

'Men could be doing much more productive things - or watching 
football.'

  The average women...
