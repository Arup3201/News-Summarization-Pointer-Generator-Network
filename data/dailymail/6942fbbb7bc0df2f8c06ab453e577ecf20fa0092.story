Frustrated police still have no firm leads in their investigation into the disappearance of toddler William Tyrell, six weeks after the three-year-old disappeared from his grandmother's front yard.

Detectives have spoken to every person they could locate who was in Kendall on the mid-north coast of NSW on September 12, when William, dressed in his favourite Spiderman costume, was last seen. 

The investigation into William's disappearance passed the six-week mark on Friday, as followers of a Facebook page set up to help find the little boy who loved fire engines topped 17,000.

Strike Force Rosann detectives are now collating information including hundreds of calls from the public, a police spokeswoman said. 'There is nothing new, unfortunately,' the spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia. 'It is very frustrating for police.' 

Detectives, who found no trace of William during an intense nine-day search and are concentrating their investigation on the theory William was abducted, have previously described the case as 'astonishing'.

William disappeared from his grandmother's yard in Benaroon Drive, Kendall, about 10.30am on September 12, five minutes after he was last seen by his grandmother and mother. He had been playing with his four-year-old sister.

A huge search of surrounding properties and bushland failed to find a trace of the boy. One lead police have investigated is a report of a 'well-dressed, well-spoken' man who reportedly asked a local shopkeeper for directions to Batar Creek Road, which leads to Benaroon Drive, on the morning William disappeared.

Earlier this month, Strike Force Rosann commander Acting Superintendent Tony Joice said police wanted to interview every person who was in Kendall on September 12 to determine what they were doing and why they were there. He described the case as 'astonishing'.  

'If you were in the Kendall area, we need to know what you were doing, who you were visiting, what car you were driving, what you were doing there,' Acting Superintendent Joice told The Telegraph. 'It’s about putting the pieces together.'

That task is now complete, a police spokeswoman said.

The search for William included police from the dog squad, officers on horseback and on trail bikes, divers, Forensic Services Group members and a helicopter.

Volunteers from the State Emergency Service, Rural Fire Service, Surf Life Saving, and local citizens scoured the main search area for nine days without finding any trace of the boy. 

After five days police conceded the boy could not have survived in bushland alone. Some ground was searched more than 10 times.

Police interviewed William's sister but she was unable to provide any information about his disappearance. 

William's family have remained out of public view but a friend, Nicole, has made several appeals for help. She said while William enjoyed being outdoors he had no tendency to wander off. 

'He is a happy, cheeky, adventurous little boy who doesn’t wander off,' Nicole said. 'William is pretty much always happy. He was happy to play in the garden and be with his family.'

 'Someone, somewhere' knows something about the disappearance of William Tyler, says Superintendent Paul Fehon

Mid-North Coast local area commander Superintendent Paul Fehon has said 'someone, somewhere' must know something about William's disappearance. 

William's family thanked searchers for their hard work. 'Thank you does not seem like the right sort of word to express our gratitude and heartfelt warmth we feel towards each and every one of you,' a statement from the family said.

'We have been completely overwhelmed with the way the public, SES, Surf Life Saving, RFS and the Police have rallied together to find our little Spiderman William.'

Anyone with any information about William's disappearance is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
