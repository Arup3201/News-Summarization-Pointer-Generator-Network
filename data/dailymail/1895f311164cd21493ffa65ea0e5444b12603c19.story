A mysterious swarm of stingless jellyfish said to look and feel like breast implants has washed up on a New Zealand beach.

The black-lined jellyfish 'the size of a teacup and maybe the size of a saucer' is apparently harmless, after a swimmer on New Zealand's Nelson Bay area was seen weighing one up in each hand.

John Midgley, said he spotted them from the roadside and on closer inspection realised it was the first time he had seen the species in the ten years he had been holidaying in the area.

'There were swarms of them. They're almost clear with a black ring around them,' he told Stuff.co.nz

'They look like a standard jellyfish but with an odd colour. They've very definitely got a black rim, and there are hundreds in each swarm, he added.

The most common species of jelly in New Zealand is the stinging lion's-mane jellyfish (Cyanea species) and the moon jelly (Aurelia species).

Nelson's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) said swarms of various species are common for this time of year.

Dennis Gordon, NIWA principal scientist 
and jellyfish expert in Wellington, said that without seeing the 
jellyfish himself it was difficult to identify the species but the dark radials extending out from its centre, suggest it could be hydroid medusa.

He described them as looking like 'breast implants which had been badly handled'.

They grows up to 175mm wide, are saucer-shaped and are fat in the middle and gradually thin out towards the edge.

They were last seen in New Zealand in 2010 when the sea's temperature was warmer than average.

Andy Horton, editor of British Marine Life said: 'It could be one of thousands of species.

'What's more, they change in appearance throughout their one year life cycle as they grow.

'The tend to come to the end of their lives in autumn, so that is probably why they have been spotted on New Zealand's beaches.'
