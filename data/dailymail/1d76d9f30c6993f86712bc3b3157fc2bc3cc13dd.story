At an hour on Sunday when civilised people are untopping the sherry decanter after Matins, that spongy-wet curate Nick Clegg stepped in front of a gathering in York. ‘Rally’ was not quite the word.

Sunday school was more the level.

The modernist Barbican centre offered the Deputy Prime Minister a smallish space.

Word has it that his Whitehall office may be bigger than this venue.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg used his speech to his party conference in York to insist he loves Britain

The back wall was tinged orange, although the faces of his worried, earnest audience were closer to car-sick green.

Lucky devils, they had been given a warm-up speech by Lorely Burt MP.

The slogan ‘#whyIamIN’ decorated the scenery flats behind Mr Clegg. Did they mean ‘#whyIamNICK’?

It may make sense as a Twitter hashtag (whatever that might be) but as a conference-platform motto it jolted the eye.

Since last autumn, Mr Clegg has been describing the Lib Dems as ‘the party of IN’, in reference to his party’s pro-Europe stance.

It only ever reminds me of Monty Python and ‘the knights who say NI’.

‘Since I became Deputy Prime Minister,’ he began, just to make sure that we realised this was all about him.

Mr Clegg said the Liberal Democrats must remain in government after the next election to ensure that Britain is not dragged backwards by the Tories or Labour

He described how he had been round the world, representing us.

The US, South Korea, Mexico, Colombia, Ethiopia: all these places had been visited by our hero. I am sure they were amazed.

‘I love Britain,’ he said. Brace yourselves, team – patriotic guff incoming. ‘I love it for all its contradictions.

I love that we are as modest as we are proud.

I love that we insist on queuing when we go abroad, even when the locals don’t.’ Pause. ‘I love Miriam telling me that the feeling of freedom you get in Britain simply doesn’t exist anywhere else.’

The castanet clacker, since you ask, was not in attendance.

Mr Clegg has never been the most inventive orator. David Cameron has done this sort of ‘I love Britain’ spiel.

Hugh Grant did it when he played a PM on screen. Me-too Cleggy was late to the game.

He loved the shipping forecast, Private Eye, the Premier League, the European Convention on Human Rights.

Eh? Are we sure about that last one?

Best of British? A pair of flip-flips, one of the items on a list of things Nick Clegg likes about the UK

One of his grandfathers stood on the roof of Westminster Abbey at the end of the Great War and watched the troops returning from the Western Front.

‘He passionately believed that to be a British soldier, defending our values of liberty and peace was the most noble thing you could be,’ said the Europhile Clegg.

‘Smart, funny, compassionate Britain,’ said the half-Dutch Cleggster.

Following which, he segued into a passage about the rise of ‘extremist parties’ in Europe: Hungary’s Jobbik party, Bulgaria’s Ataka, Holland’s PVV party.

All that stood between us and these parties of anti-Brussels barbarianism was Maestro Clegg.

One fairly reliable rule of politics is that the truth is the opposite of what a party leader says in speeches to conferences.

In a speech in York Mr Clegg listed what he likes about modern Britain

Thus, when Mr Clegg said yesterday that ‘the Liberal Democrats are now Britain’s only party of in’, he was in fact talking baloney. Labour are wildly pro-Brussels.

The Tories, though sceptical, still currently think we should be in the EU (although they would give us a referendum). The Greens are pro-Europe, big time. So the Lib Dems are by no means the ‘only party of in’.

Mr Clegg, attacking Eurosceptics, deplored ‘stuffy parochialism dressed up as patriotism’.

But the radicalism of those who would give the voters a referendum on Europe is surely not ‘stuffy’.

Is it not more drearily Establishment to want to leave the EU as it is? Mr Clegg knocked the ‘ungenerous, backwards-looking politics’ of Eurosceptics.

Yet is it not ‘backwards’ to resist any thought of greater national liberty? 

Someone he doesn't like: Mr Clegg took aim at rivals, including Ukip leader Nigel Farage (pictured) as the pint-drinking, smiling face of an 'ungenerous, backwards-looking politics'

And hang on. Why attack UKIP? They are the best bet that the Left has of beating the Tories. Clegg should be loving UKIP! 

He ended by throwing out a few words: ‘The future not the past. Forward not back. Hope not fear.’

Such platitudes are uttered by the leaders of political parties everywhere – possibly even South Korea, Mexico, Colombia or Ethiopia. As a slogan they were no more convincing than ‘#whyIamIN’.
