Just in time for Halloween, Titan has put on a ghostly show near its north and south poles.

Saturn's moon produced a strange glow from massive emissions of two trace gases that moved along its dawn-dusk line.

These regions are curiously shifted to the east or west, so that dawn is breaking over the southern region while dusk is falling over the northern one.

High in the atmosphere of Titan, large patches of two trace gases glow near the north pole, on the dusk side of the moon, and near the south pole, on the dawn side. Brighter colors indicate stronger signals from the two gases, HNC (left) and HC3N (right); red hues indicate less pronounced signals

Researchers are baffled as to why these gases have moved off the poles – a phenomenon that conflicts with how scientists believe Titan's atmosphere behaves.

The pair of patches was spotted by a Nasa while investigating the chemical make-up of Titan's atmosphere.

It has stumped scientists because they believed that concentrated pockets of gas such as this could not exist in the moon's upper atmosphere due to its ferocious winds.

'This is an unexpected and potentially ground-breaking discovery,' said Martin Cordiner, an astrochemist at Nasa.

'These kinds of east-to-west variations have never been seen before in Titan's atmospheric gases. Explaining their origin presents us with a fascinating new problem.'

With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere

The mapping comes from observations made by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (Alma), a network of high-precision antennas in Chile. 

Researchers were able to obtain spatial maps of chemicals in Titan's atmosphere from a 'snapshot' observation that lasted less than three minutes.

With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere.

Because Titan is smaller than Earth, its gravity doesn’t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly, so the atmosphere extends 370 miles (595 kilometres) into space.

As on Earth, the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons, although the seasons on Titan are about seven Earth years long.

Titan's ‘water’ is liquid methane, CH4, better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is -180°C (-292°F).

With Titan's low gravity and dense atmosphere, methane raindrops could grow twice as large as Earth's raindrops. As well as this, they would fall more slowly, drifting down like snowflakes.

But scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades.

Titan's atmosphere has long been of interest because it acts as a chemical factory, using energy from the sun and Saturn's magnetic field to produce a wide range of organic, or carbon-based, molecules.

In this study, the researchers focused on two organic molecules, hydrogen isocyanide (HNC) and cyanoacetylene (HC3N) that are formed in Titan's atmosphere.

At lower altitudes, the HC3N appears concentrated above Titan's north and south poles.

But the highest altitudes, the gas pockets appeared to be shifted away from the poles.

These off-pole locations are unexpected because the fast-moving winds in Titan's middle atmosphere move in an east–west direction, forming zones similar to Jupiter's bands, though much less pronounced.

Within each zone, the atmospheric gases should, for the most part, be thoroughly mixed - not distinct as is seen in these gases.

The researchers do not have an explanation for their findings yet.

'It seems incredible that chemical mechanisms could be operating on rapid enough timescales to cause enhanced 'pockets' in the observed molecules,' said Conor Nixon, a planetary scientist at Nasa.

'We would expect the molecules to be quickly mixed around the globe by Titan's winds.'

At the moment, the scientists are considering a number of potential explanations, including thermal effects, previously unknown patterns of atmospheric circulation, or the influence of Saturn's powerful magnetic field, which extends far enough to engulf Titan.

Further observations are expected to improve the understanding of the atmosphere and ongoing processes on Titan and other objects throughout the solar system.

Studying this complex chemistry may provide insights into the properties of Earth's very early atmosphere, which may have shared chemical characteristics with present-day Titan.
