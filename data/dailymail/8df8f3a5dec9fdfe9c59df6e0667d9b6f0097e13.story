They were eliminated last night after serving up undercooked steak and runny crème brulee.

And now My Kitchen Rules favourites Harry and Christo have confessed that their cooking was often less than perfect because they were more focused on chatting up their fellow contestants.

The flirtatious friends from Melbourne appeared on TV and radio on Wednesday where they stayed coy about romance rumours involving 25-year-old Harry and 21-year-old Tasmanian contestant Bianca.

Christo, 26, also hinted at bad blood between the boys and twins Helena and Vikki.

Harry and Christo fought through a tough sudden death elimination against the twins but ultimately lost on Tuesday night's episode.

Christo appeared on NovaFM on Wednesday morning where he was asked what he would miss most about the MKR kitchen.

'I'd say definitely the flirting - the cooking comes second,' he told Fitzy and Wippa.

Christo also appeared on WaveFM's Hot Breakfast where he stayed coy about romance rumours between Harry and Tasmanian student Bianca.

'Did they get it on?' asked radio host Travis.

'Look I'm unaware of anything that went down...' Christo said, before he was interrupted by Travis.

'Mate you are full of crap. Come on Christo,' he said.

Christo responded by saying: 'Look I'm just going to tell you what I've told everybody. As far as I know we're just good mates and Harry and Bianca... good friends.'

The former MKR cook also suggested that there were tensions between the boys and twins Vikki and Helena who knocked them out of the competition.

'I don't not like Helena and Vikki, but me and the way I'd go about the competition I wouldn’t sit there and go "We all know Harry and Christo can't cook and they're the people we want to cook against,”’ he said.

‘It's just not me so I just can’t relate to them.

'I like them, they’re nothing but polite, but I guess just I can’t relate to them as people.'

Christo and best friend Harry also appeared on Channel Seven morning show Sunrise, where they admitted they did not have any food-related plans for the future.

'We'll come back to you on that one. Because it's been a pretty tough road so far, we're not that crash hot,' Harry told hosts David Koch and Samantha Armytage.

'We could get into food, we don't know. We don't want to hurt the public anymore with…'

Christo then cut in to finish his mate's sentence: 'With our delicious dishes!'

Christo also spoke about his smooch from 'good kisser' Manu, which he received for perfectly cooking Bearnaise sauce during last night's elimination round.

'Oh he's amazing. I'll tell you what, he's sensational and I feel like I got a special kiss because he usually gives the double kiss and I only got one,' he said.

'So I feel like maybe I'm unique to Manu, I'm not sure.'

The friends won over fans both at home and within the competition with their boyish charm and flirtatious ways.

Contestant Bianca – who has been romantically linked to Harry off-screen – appeared the most upset by their elimination on Tuesday night's show as she threw her arms around Harry for one last goodbye.

Bianca couldn't help but shed a tear when it was announced the boys fell had fallen short in the sudden death challenge.

'We're really, really going to miss Harry and Christo,' she said, 'I don't want to say goodbye!'

Harry told The West Australian that he is still in contact with Bianca and her partner Thalia, as well as other contestants Josh and Danielle, Uel and Shannelle and Chloe and Kelly.
