A champion showjumper died of a heart condition brought on by her anorexia, an inquest has heard.

Laura Ferguson, 26, had struggled with an eating disorder since the sudden death of her mother on Christmas Day in 2008, but her relatives believed she had 'got over' the illness.  

However, in September last year she was found dead at her home in Burnley by her father Joe.  

Tragic: Laura Ferguson died of a heart condition related to her ongoing struggle with anorexia

Passion: Miss Ferguson was a champion showjumper who had represented England in international contests

Family: The 26-year-old struggled to cope with the death of her mother Anne, right, on Christmas Day in 2008 

Miss Ferguson worked as a carer and had represented England at pony-jumping, winning a gold medal in an international competition, Burnley Coroner's Court heard yesterday.  

Her father told the inquest that she had struggled to cope with her mother's death from a heart attack, and subsequently developed anorexia.  

'Laura was very close to her mother and was very significantly affected by that,' Mr Ferguson said.  

'For the next few months she wasn't eating properly. She tried to disguise it with baggy clothes.'  

Discovery: Miss Ferguson's father Joe found her dead in her bedroom on September 23 last year 

Loss: Miss Ferguson was thought to be recovering from her eating disorder at the time of her death

Miss Ferguson consulted her GP about her eating disorder, and was referred to two clinics including the Priory Centre in Bury.  

'She spent some time there but when she came out her appetite had returned,' her father said. 'She had responded to treatment.  

'She seemed absolutely fine and was quite happy with herself. She had everything to look forward to. 

'We had booked a holiday to Egypt in September. She had been out buying new clothes - she was excited.' 

Mr Ferguson said that his daughter, whom he described as 'fit and active', complained of a headache when she returned from work on September 22.

Devastated: Mr Ferguson thought that his daughter was sleeping but discovered she was 'unresponsive'

Harrowing: Miss Ferguson had posted a series of photos of her emaciated leg on Facebook

He thought she was asleep when he checked her bedroom at 8am the next day, but when he looked again at midday she was 'unresponsive'.  

Pathologist Abdul Al-Dawoud, who carried out a port-mortem examination, said the 'most likely' cause of death was an inflammation of the heart called myocarditis, commonly brought on by viral infections.  

He said: 'There is nothing to suggest that this is anything other than a natural cause of death. This medical cause of death is not uncommon.'  

Coroner Richard Taylor concluded that Miss Ferguson died of natural causes, saying: 'There was a problem with her heart. From what the doctor has told me, it cannot be anything else.'
