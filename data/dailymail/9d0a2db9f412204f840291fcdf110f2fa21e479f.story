French first lady Valerie Trierweiler tried to ban the media from showing a photo of her wearing a bikini, it emerged today.

In an astonishing legal move, the 47-year-old employed a team of lawyers to issue warnings and threats about possible court action.

This is despite the fact that Ms Trierweiler remains a staff writer for Paris Match, France's leading glossy celebrity magazine.

Challenge: Match is full of pictures of public figures on the beach every week, but Ms Trierweiler objected to other publications capturing a swim she enjoyed with her president boyfriend earlier this month

Match is full of pictures of public 
figures on the beach every week, but Ms Trierweiler objected to other 
publications capturing a swim she enjoyed with her president boyfriend 
earlier this month.

Criticism: Ms Trierweiler is a staff writer for glossy celebrity magazine Paris Match. The publication printed photos of former First Lady Carla Bruni in her bikini while pregnant on holiday with Nicolas Sarkozy

'She didn't like the pictures so wanted them banned,' said a Paris legal source close to the case.

'Faxes were sent to editors, with lawyers threatening all kinds of measures for non-compliance.'

At the time many believed that 
Francois Hollande, 58, had staged the 'shorts and bikini' photo-shoot to
prove that was still 'very much in love' with his controversial 
girlfriend.

Waiting 
photographers were astonished to see the portly couple splashing around 
on a beach close to the palatial Fort Bregancon, on the French Riviera.

The
couple have been trying to play down speculation that Mr Hollande had 
threatened to dump his live-in lover after she tried to wreck his 
ex-girlfriend's political career.

Ms
Trierweiler tweeted her support for a candidate standing in 
parliamentary elections against Segolene Royal, the mother of the 
president's four children.

Ms Royal went on to lose the election, widely blaming Ms Trierweiler for stabbing her in the back.

The
scandal led Prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault to tell Ms Trierweiler 
that she should 'know her place', while Mr Hollande's eldest son, Thomas
Hollande, said the tweet had destroyed his father's 'Mr Normal' image.

Elysee Palace sources also said the President was furious with his girlfriend, who is nicknamed Valerie 'Rottweiler'.

Mr Hollande and Ms Royal lived together for more than 30 years before he left her for Ms Trierweiler in 2005.

Ms Trierweiler later indicated that she regretted the tweet - saying she would 'count to 10' before sending another - but never actually apologised to Ms Royal - prompting speculation that Mr Hollande would leave her.

The beach photo shoot appeared on the front page of a number of Paris magazines, including VSD, which later carried an editorial confirmed Ms Trierweiler's legal 'intervention'.

All the publications affected, including Voici, have pledged to fight any attempts by Ms Trierweiler to muzzle the media.

Ms Trierweiler has not commented on the scandal, but has made it clear that she wants to carry on writing for Paris Match.
