With his big brown eyes and adorable quiff of light brown hair, Prince George is wasting no time in wowing the crowds Down Under.

But it is hardly surprising that the young Prince is such a bonny baby with such two photogenic parents.

And baby pictures of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge reveal that George has picked up his share of attributes from both.

Princely looks: George looked happy and alert as he touched down in New Zealand and doesn't he look like his dad when he was the same age?

Pictures taken of the young Princes at the same age show a striking resemblance between them.

The eight-month old has the same hair colour and style as his father, Prince William sported at the same age, together with his cute button nose and chubby cheeks.

Both babies showed a lively and cheerful nature, with the boys showing a relaxed attitude towards being the centre of attention.

Such a beautiful baby - and Prince George is the perfect combination of his parents' good looks

Looks familiar? Those chubby cheeks, that button nose - even the young Prince William's outfit looks similar

Photoshoots at Kensington Palace, where Prince William lived as a child and where he now lives with his wife and son, show a happy, smiling baby who is being gradually prepared for a life in the public eye.

While Prince George has inherited his hair colour and cute nose from his father, his chubby cheeks and cute chin can be said to hail from the Middleton side of the family, with Kate's baby pictures showing his mother with a determined look and a mop of dark hair.

Although he is just eight months old, Prince George has already had his share of public appearances, most notably outside the the hospital where he had been born just the day before.

The young Prince has also been photographed in the garden of his maternal grandparents' house and for official portraits during his christening. 

Now his journey to New Zealand and Australia while yield a whole new range of pictures of Prince George as they did for his father on a trip Down Under when he was just ten months old.

He's back in New Zealand but Prince William first went there in May 1983 when he was 10 months old, pictured here in the the grounds of Government House in Auckland.

In spite of a lengthy flight halfway 
around the world, plus a brief stopover in Sydney, the little prince 
showed himself impervious to the ravages of long-haul travelling.

He
 behaved himself beautifully while being carried down the steps of the 
scheduled Qantas flight by his mother to greet waiting dignitaries 
including the New Zealand prime minister John Key.

George wore a cream cardigan over a white shirt, matching shorts and soft leather shoes and socks - ideal for a baby who has just started crawling.

The outfit was a modern version of the smocked top and peach bloomer style shorts that William wore when he visited the country at the same age.

His mother looked equally refreshed and particularly elegant in a pillar-box red coat by Catherine Walker, a British designer favoured by William’s late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and a pillbox hat by Gina Foster.

Good looks are in the family: Prince George's mother Kate may have had darker hair than her eight-month-old son but the resemblance is clear to see in this image of Kate, being held by her grandmother Dorothy Goldsmith at her christening in 1982

She was also wearing a diamond and platinum silver fern brooch, on loan from the Queen.
