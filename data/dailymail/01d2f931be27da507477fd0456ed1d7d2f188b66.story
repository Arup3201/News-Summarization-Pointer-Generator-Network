Whether I’m glammed up for a night out or sitting at home on the sofa, I wouldn’t dream of going without lipstick. The reason? My natural lip colour is very pale and without a touch of lippy I look positively cadaverous. For this reason I have worn lipstick or gloss every day since I was 13.

This vanity costs me a small fortune — almost £50 — as I get through two or three products every month. I’m always on the lookout for the holy grail of lipsticks, one which goes on and jolly well stays put. So, when I heard about the new Rouge Edition Velvet by Bourjois and the company’s claim that it lasts for a full day without smudging off, I could hardly contain myself.

Can this be true? The boffins at Bourjois may have tested it scientifically, but I decided to put it, and five competitors, to a rather more practical test. Each lipstick was subjected to the rigours of me eating a sandwich, drinking a glass of wine and . . . kissing my husband. Here’s how they fared.

The smooch test: Alice (wearing Rouge Edition Velvet in Frambourjois by Bourjois) with her husband Justin

STICKING AROUND

Rouge Edition Velvet in Frambourjois by Bourjois, £8.99 boots.com

APPLICATION: This reminds me a little of a felt tip pen. You need a steady hand, but the result is smooth and even. It has a matte finish though the texture leaves my lips feeling a bit dry. The colour is a vivid pink — much brighter than I would normally use — but I rather like it, especially now that I have a bit of a tan.

THE TEST: I made some sandwiches with sliced white bread to show up any lipstick that comes off — not hugely classy perhaps, but effective. As I bite into a smoked salmon triangle, a half-moon shaped stain instantly appears. I lick my lips. Whoops, there’s another bit of lipstick gone. But when I look in the mirror, my lips are as bright pink as when I started. Feeling rather perky, I take a sip of prosecco, which leaves a glowing crescent on the glass.

Next, I haul Mr Smellie out of his study for a (reasonably) passionate kiss. You’d think he would be thrilled at a bit of affection from his wife, but he seems more concerned with returning to his computer.

Afterwards my lips are still bright pink, which is impressive, but so are my husband’s. He rubs at his mouth in disgust with the back of his hand.

VERDICT: A great deal has come off, yet my lips still look great. The colour certainly holds. Mr Smellie may just have to get used to it. 

SCORE: 7/10

Lipstick left behind: The Bourjois lipstick leaves it's mark on Justin, but overall Alice is impressed

NO STAYING POWER

George Matte Lipstick in Luscious at Asda, £4

APPLICATION: This is a pleasant, glossy light pink and feels expensive and moisturising as I carefully draw it around my lips. The result is a demure rose colour. I look as though I am going to a summer garden party.

THE TEST: There is a pretty pink rim on the bread after my first bite of sandwich, and as I sip from my glass a bright mark instantly appears on the side of the glass. I suppose if I were actually at a summer garden party at least I wouldn’t lose my drink.

A smooch with Mr Smellie leaves me looking like a clown. I gather, from his under-the-breath mutterings, that he is less than impressed with this one which comes off as easily as it went on.

VERDICT: A lovely lipstick, but there’s little left on my mouth and too much all around it. 

SCORE: 4/10

SMOOCH-PROOF

Ruby Woo by Mac, £15.50, debenhams.com

APPLICATION: Debenhams tell me their best-selling lipstick this year is Mac’s Ruby Woo — almost 4,000 units have flown off the shelves after Vogue declared that it is: ‘extra matt, red, lasts all night long’. It feels very dry on my mouth but the final effect is an even and bright red.

THE TEST: When I take a bite of my sandwich there is barely a mark left on the white bread. I have to peer at the edges in bright daylight to see even a smidgen of smudge. It’s the same with my wine glass — a mere whisper of pigment is left behind. After a quick smooch with my husband (if I’m honest, they’re getting less enthusiastic) there is barely a hint of red on him and my lips still look fantastic.

VERDICT: There’s a little staining around my mouth, but my lips remain bright red. Impressive. 

SCORE: 8/10

Sandwich a la Lipstick: Alice (wearing Lip Lacquer in Dangerous Lips by Gosh) makes a mark on her lunch

VAMPING IT UP

Lip Lacquer in Dangerous Lips by Gosh, £3.99, superdrug.com

APPLICATION: This is a magnificent and intensely coloured lip gloss with a rich and creamy texture. The bottle is squat and looks as though it contains nail varnish rather than lip gloss. The short sponge applicator makes it easy to apply and the gloss smells delicious. A deep colour and gorgeous, glamorous high-shine finish.

THE TEST: I’m afraid this makes a bit of a mess. There is a semi-circle of scarlet on the sandwich and you could pick out my glass from across a room, such is the brilliance of the hue after just one sip. They both look as though I might be bleeding. My husband appears to have been in a fight, rather than a loving embrace with his wife. And I resemble a vampire who’s just feasted on a victim.

VERDICT: It looks great at the start, but it comes off super quickly — and the result ain’t pretty. 

SCORE: 2/10

Red or white? Though Alice likes the Gosh lipstick's colour, it comes off 'super quickly', and it ain't pretty

PERSISTENT POUT

Semi-permanent Lipstain Pen by Stargazer in No6, £4, stargazer-products.com

APPLICATION: This looks like a neon marker. I feel as though I am drawing on my mouth rather than applying lipstick. Once on, I look a bit muttony — this colour is too bright for anyone over 25.

THE TEST: They claim this lasts 24 hours, and indeed it is quite extraordinary. No marks are left on the bread, glass or husband. When I pick the children up from school (looking as though I’m off clubbing, such is the glow-in-the-dark quality of my lips) I also test it on them. They loathe lipstickey kisses, but this doesn’t leave a trace on them either.

Even when I vigourously rub my mouth with the back of my hand, there’s just a light orange stain. It takes five minutes’ elbow grease and three make-up removal wipes to get it off.

VERDICT: Impressive and certainly does what it says on the tin. In fact, it lasts longer than 24 hours. I draw some on my hand on friday night and it’s still there on Sunday morning, in spite of my having, obviously, washed a few times in the interim. 

SCORE: 9/10

MAKE YOUR MARK

Rouge Prodige True-hold Colour and Shine Lipstick in Mystic Plum by Clarins, £19, John Lewis

APPLICATION: It smoothes on evenly and the lipstick’s thick, creamy texture gives my mouth a misleadingly youthful plumpness. I look elegant and sophisticated. This is by far my favourite colour.

THE TEST: As I bite into my sandwich, I can feel the lipstick coming off on the bread, as though I am using it to blot my mouth and a light plum shadow is left behind. It’s the same on the glass — there is a faint imprint of my lips.

I’m afraid that some also came off onto my husband. He wandered off to walk the dog with a purple smudge on his left cheek.

VERDICT: There is little lipstick left but my lips feel wonderfully moisturised and I don’t mind reapplying in the least. 

SCORE: 6/10
