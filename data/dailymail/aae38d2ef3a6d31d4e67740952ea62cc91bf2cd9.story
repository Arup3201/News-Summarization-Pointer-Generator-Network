Former ballerina and Strictly Come Dancing judge Darcey Bussell says she never moans about her figure in front of her two daughters, in order to ensure they grow up feeling confident about their bodies.

Instead, Bussell promotes healthy eating and fitness around Phoebe, 12, and nine-year-old Zoe, her two children with husband Angus Forbes. And she always makes them eat breakfast.

Speaking to Hello! magazine, Bussell, 44, says being a mother has made her suddenly 'very conscious' of her age, and now that she is 'not as toned as I used to be', she chooses to cover her arms.

Although she has given up dancing, Bussell's lifestyle is still impressively active: she swims twice a week, walks her two dogs daily, and regularly attempts Zumba classes, saying: 'I stand at the back and make a fool of myself but I don't care.'

Talking about her children, the former dancer added: 'I can never whinge in front of them. If I don't say things like, "Ooh, I can't do up my skirt, my waist is going," or, "I've got to keep my tummy in," they won't worry about those things.

'It's an instinct with any girl to want to look good, and my eldest loves fashion and clothes, but I just tell them: "You've got to be healthy, you've got to have a proper breakfast.' Iâ€™m a bit of a sergeant major on that one.'
