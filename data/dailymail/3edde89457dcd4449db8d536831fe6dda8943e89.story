A woman has begun living out of Cancun airport after flying in from the United States - and police are powerless to stop her.

The woman - who initially 'looks just like a passenger' - has been spotted eating, sleeping and bathing at various points around the Mexican airport since June 30th.

The 45-year-old woman has caught the attention of concerned workers strolling through the terminals, sleeping on the floor, washing in the restrooms and withdrawing money from an ATM to pay for meals at the airport restaurants.

Whereas most would want to leave the airport straight away after landing, one woman (not pictured) has set up home there

A police spokesman 'routine inspection' found that the woman is carrying a Mexican passport in the name of Marcela Silvia Montano Mancera, who was born in the Federal District on May 2, 1968, Yahoo reported.

The Mexican citizen, is being watched by officers but as she has not committed a crime, cannot be arrested, Federal Police told Yahoo.

Airport authorities cannot understand why she hasn't left the airport and returned home.

The Global Post says that the woman has been heard talking to herself in both Spanish and English.

Authorities have reportedly tried to contact her family but have failed to reach any relatives, the NY Daily News said.

Her actions are similar to The Terminal film, where Tom Hanks played an immigrant who is denied entry into America and at the same time cannot return to his native country because of a revolution, and is forced to live in an airport.

That film was partially based on the life of Mehran Karimi Nasseri, an Iranian refugee who lived in the departure lounge of Terminal One in Charles de Gaulle Airport, in Paris, from 26 August 1988 until July 2006.

He claimed he was expelled from Iran in 1977 for protests against the Shah and after a long battle, involving applications in several countries, was finally given refugee status, so he could choose any European country.

He embarked on a trip to England, claimed he was mugged and had his documents stolen, was allowed to fly from Paris but promptly returned.

Because of a lack of proof about his situation, he was arrested for attempting to enter the country illegally and lost papers meant the French had no country of origin which they could return him to. 

The police returned him to the confines of the airport, and he lived there until he was hospitalised for a condition.

He is now believed to be living in Paris.
