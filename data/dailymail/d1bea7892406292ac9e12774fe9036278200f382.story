Jordan Henderson has attempted to paint England’s humiliating flop in Brazil as a positive experience for the players who bid to avoid a third straight Group D defeat on Tuesday when they face Costa Rica.

The 24-year-old started both of England's group games in central midfield, but could not prevent 2-1 defeats at the hands of Italy and Uruguay.

But the Liverpool star has tried to put a positive spin on the Three Lions' struggles, believing that their Brazilian voyage has not been a totally futile exercise.

Henderson told the FA.com: ‘It was a low point. I’m sure everyone at home is feeling down.

'We feel as though we have let a lot of people down, but at the same time we have shown people how well we can play in a big tournament with young players coming through.

‘We went out and played with no fear. We have a promising young side, hopefully we can gel together and in the future have many more happy memories.

‘It doesn’t really get much bigger than playing in the World Cup. It’s been an unbelievable experience, but no matter whether we’ve had highs or lows, you have to learn from it as best you can.

‘I’m sure the young lads here will learn from that and it will make them stronger and better as well.’

England are out after two games; the first 
time they have failed to progress beyond the group stage of the World
 Cup since 1958, and their shortest campaign since 1950.
