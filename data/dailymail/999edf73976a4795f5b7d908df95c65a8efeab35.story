Secret evidence implicating leading law and insurance firms in phone hacking, surveillance and data theft is to be probed by MPs.

A report submitted to the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards suggests hackers and private investigators are routinely paid to dig for information on companies and individuals.

Among the practices revealed by the confidential – and now leaked – Serious Organised Crime Agency report were live telephone interceptions, computer hacking, police corruption and obtaining itemised phone bills.

A report submitted to the Leveson Inquiry suggests that 80 per cent of phone hacking was not done by journalists

Last night Keith Vaz, who chairs the Commons home affairs select committee, said he suspected the evidence was withheld from Parliament during a previous probe into private investigators. The Labour MP now plans to recall ‘relevant witnesses’.

But Lord Justice Leveson is also facing questions as to why he failed to highlight in his inquiry the allegations of misbehaviour by businesses other than the media.

He was apparently told that law firms, insurance companies, wealthy individuals and even local councils were paying investigators for sensitive information.

The report dates back to 2008 but does not feature in the 1,987-page findings of the Leveson Inquiry, which was triggered by phone hacking at the now defunct News of the World.

One hacker has said 80 per cent of his client list comprised blue-chip companies and high-profile individuals, with the rest related to the media.

Among those said to have benefitted from such practices was law firm Mishcon de Reya, which employed a private detective agency that outsourced work to criminals. Other clients are thought to include a big telecoms firm, a celebrity broadcaster and a businessman involved in a multi-million pound takeover.

Mr Vaz said: ‘When the committee conducted its inquiry we asked for all the relevant information from Soca. It appears that all these documents were not provided. I will be putting this on the committee’s agenda for Tuesday and asking members if we should recall the relevant witnesses.’ 

John Whittingdale, who chairs the Commons culture, media and sport committee, which investigated phone hacking, said: ‘The Leveson Inquiry was set up specifically to look at the Press, but if it was presented with evidence that there was illegal activity taking place elsewhere it seems pretty extraordinary that it did not flag this up.

‘But a bigger question is if Soca had uncovered evidence of widespread criminality or questionable practice, why were they reporting it to the Leveson Inquiry and not investigating and prosecuting people?’ 

Nicola Blackwood, a Tory member of the home affairs select committee, said: ‘It was clear from our inquiry into private investigators that under-regulation meant that hacking and other criminal practices were far from confined to the media.

‘If Soca has had evidence of specific offences since 2008, we need to know exactly what they have been doing about it since then. Who else knew about this? And how did they justify the total exclusion of this evidence from the Leveson report?’ 

The confidential Soca report, leaked at the weekend, highlighted how some of the country’s most respected industries are deeply embroiled in the trade in secret information.

Local authorities were even paying for information about people who owed money for council tax, rent and parking fines.

Investigators said that in one case, a technical expert had created a bugging device which could be physically attached to landlines at the nearest signal box by a BT-trained engineer.

They found the industry giving most business to criminal private detectives was City law firms and insurers. Many of them were involved in divorce or family proceedings or suspicious high-value insurance claims.

Yet, Soca, which attempted to dub itself as ‘Britain’s FBI’ but will soon be replaced by a new National Crime Agency, apparently did nothing to halt the thriving unlawful business. The document – codenamed Project Riverside – was privately supplied to the Leveson inquiry last year.

But the judge’s final report simply made a passing reference,  acknowledging that buyers of personal data ‘included the media, insurance companies, lenders and creditors, parties involved in family disputes, criminals with what are likely to have been criminal or malicious intentions, including witness and juror intimidation, and estranged couples seeking details of their partner’s whereabouts’.

Arnold & Porter was, with Mishcon de Reya, one of the firms said to have used information supplied by crooked private investigators.

The BBC could not find space in its radio or TV bulletins yesterday for the extraordinary revelations about blue chip hacking.

Neither was the national broadcaster able to add a story to the website it has dedicated to the inquiry into media standards.

The Independent newspaper reported the existence of the leaked Serious Organised Crime Agency document on Saturday.

Claims that Lord Justice Leveson turned a blind eye to wrongdoing by his fellow lawyers as well as insurers and local councils caused a considerable stir online.

The Independent front page was followed up by several media outlets including the Sunday Times and The Sun on Sunday. But during this 48-hour window the closest the BBC came to reporting the story was a short mention on a newspaper review.

The lacklustre response contrasts sharply with the wall-to-wall coverage the BBC gave to the Leveson Inquiry itself.

The corporation reported almost every single development of the inquiry during eight months of hearings that lambasted the mainstream media. It offers readers the chance to ‘relive the inquiry’ week by week on a website.

They employed a detective agency to obtain personal information, including the finances of a failed business tycoon. The agency – Surrey-based Carratu – then subcontracted the work to husband and wife team Sharon and Stephen Anderson, trading as Analysis & Business Research.

The duo earned up to £140,000 a year by obtaining banking details, income tax information and ex-directory telephone numbers from their Cambridgeshire home. They were convicted of 55 offences under the Data Protection Act at Huntingdon Magistrates’ Court in November 2006.

Mishcon, Arnold & Porter and Carratu all denied knowing the Andersons were acting unlawfully. 

Mishcon de Reya, which acted for the Princess of Wales in her divorce, cut its ties with Carratu after the case emerged in 2006. 

A Soca spokesman said: ‘Soca produced a confidential report in 2008 on the issue of licensing the private investigation industry. 

‘This report remains confidential and Soca does not comment on leaked documents or specific criminal investigations. Information is shared with other partners as required.’

The trade for personal and company data is driven by officials locked in legal disputes and those hunting missing debtors.

They deny offences were carried out with their knowledge, claiming they thought the sensitive information was obtained legitimately.

But those procuring the information are often acting illegally.

In many cases they are breaking several laws and risking jail. In some cases private investigators openly admit this, and use the risk to justify their often extortionate fees.

The most serious offence was the one most routinely committed by blaggers and hackers: conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. Carrying a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, this would apply to anyone who knowingly obtains secret information from official databases.

Lord Justice Leveson kept silent last
night as his inquiry was hit by yet another controversy. His staff said
the row over hacking, blagging and information theft was nothing to do 
with his report on Press standards.

They accused critics of 
‘misunderstanding’ the remit of the £5.5million inquiry ordered by David
Cameron. But the Court of Appeal judge may be forced to defend his 
actions if summoned by a parliamentary inquiry.

MPs want Lord Leveson to explain why he apparently disregarded the torrent of evidence pointing to widespread wrongdoing.

His inquiry has already suffered a 
series of setbacks since it was published last November. Critics 
highlighted a series of mistakes and discovered several parts were cut 
and pasted from the internet.

Most embarrassingly it emerged that a 
counsel for the inquiry was having a secret affair with the barrister 
for one of the media’s leading critics.

In the most serious and worrying cases it would apply to police officers. But it could also include trusted staff at organisations that hold huge amounts of information such as the DVLA, Revenue and Customs or the NHS.

It has become the charge of choice in cases against journalists and civil servants.

Anyone undertaking illicit ex-directory checks or identifying records of family and friends would breach section 55 of the Data Protection Act.

Other offences might include using a telephone number or number plate to obtain a home address or bank statement.

Most personal information crooks brought to court are dealt with by magistrates who have the power only to hand out a maximum fine of £5,000.

Those caught often see this punishment as derisory.
