Toni Kroos has rubbed salt in the wounds of Bayern Munich fans following his £24million move to Real Madrid, by claiming the Champions League holders are ‘the greatest club in the world’.

The midfielder left the Allianz Arena after the World Cup following a hugely successful four-year spell at the club.

But, in his first official interview since becoming a Madrid player, he said: ‘In my opinion, Real Madrid is the greatest club in the world and for that reason, I didn’t really need to think twice [about joining them].

Kroos said he cannot wait to start playing with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Sergio Ramos.

‘It’s
 clear that all of those players have enormous quality. Real Madrid have
 very good players – they always have had. It will be out of this world 
to play alongside such great players, Real Madrid really has a 
magnificent team.’

The 24-year-old won the World Cup with Germany at the Maracana on July 13 and then signed for Madrid four days later.

‘I’ve
 certainly had worse weeks!’ he said, when asked about his busy 
schedule. ‘There’s no doubt about that. First we won the World Cup in 
Brazil and now I have officially joined Real Madrid and I am extremely 
happy about that.'

On his 
unveiling, which included him performing tricks in front of hundreds of 
fans at the Santiago Bernabeu, he said: ‘I am very proud to be at 
Madrid. It’s something very special and also to step out into the 
Bernabeu wearing the Madrid shirt for the first time was a fantastic 
feeling. The fans gave me a wonderful reception.

‘I
 was absolutely convinced that I had made the right decision to come 
here when I signed the contract and everything that has happened to me 
since only confirms that.

‘Everything
 has worked out quickly and easily; I really enjoyed getting to meet the
 fans – that was a special moment for me and it made me realise I have 
made the correct decision.

‘I
 have played at the Bernabeu twice with Bayern Munich and it was a 
magnificent experience. But now, playing at my new home, as a Real 
Madrid player and with those fans behind me is going to be an even 
better experience. I know that the atmosphere here is wonderful. I’m 
looking forward to our home games which I am sure will be very 
successful.’

Kroos was 
given a tour of Madrid’s training base at Valdebebas, where he also met 
Carlo Ancelotti and a number of his new team-mates.

‘It
 was very nice and very interesting to see the training facilities for 
the first time. I’m sure I will get to know the training complex a lot 
better.

‘I was very 
impressed with what I saw – the complex is very big and it was also very
 nice to meet the coach I had already spoken with him and now I cannot 
wait for August 5 to arrive so that I can start training with the squad 
and be ready to start playing.

‘Carlo
 told me he is very happy to have me here, and that the transfer had 
gone as planned and also that he was very happy that I had decided to 
join Real Madrid.

‘He said
 that he was delighted to be able to welcome me on board today and is 
looking forward to seeing me on August 5 when I will join the squad for 
training.’

The German also had some kind words to say about Madrid legend Alfredo Di Stefano, who passed away at the beginning of July.

‘Everyone
 I have spoken to here has told me what Alfredo Di Stefano means to Real
 Madrid, and that he was an absolute club legend.

‘He made the club even greater than it was before and everyone told me how sad they are at his passing.

‘I
 think that it will take some time before that sadness fades and I hope 
that our future will be just as successful here at Real Madrid.’
