Arsenal swooped to ban the use of an anti-Arsene Wenger banner ahead of their clash against Galatasaray.

The Gunners manager has been under huge pressure of late after a difficult start to the season.

And supporters intent on making their feelings clear towards the Frenchman in Istanbul were told by Arsenal officials not to display the banner in the Turk Telecom Arena so not contravene stadium protocol.

Arsenal supporters held up a banner at the West Brom game demanding Arsene Wenger's exit - there is no suggestion that the above banner was the same one which was banned

The club were adamant the banner had not been confiscated.

'Wenger Out' banners have become a regular occurrence at Arsenal matches of late as ill-feeling towards the manager escalates.

The Frenchman was heavily criticised by disgruntled Gunners fans, who want Wenger to leave the club, following Saturday's disappointing loss against Stoke City.

Internet footage of furious Arsenal fans volleying a torrent of verbal abuse at Wenger as his side boarded a train back to London following their 3-2 defeat at the Britannia Stadium went viral over the weekend.

It has also been claimed fights erupted between pro and anti-Wenger fans on Saturday as tensions flared over the club's poor start.

But on Monday, Wenger hit back at fans who gave him a tongue-lashing on Saturday, claiming he is man enough to take it.

When asked if such abuse was wearing him down, the Gunners manager defiantly responded: 'No, not at all. We have to cope with that.'
