Alan Pardew never lost the Newcastle dressing room during their miserable run of form earlier in the season, according to former Magpies' favourite Warren Barton.

The St. James' Park outfit failed to win their opening seven games of the season in the Premier League as pressure on club owner Mike Ashley to replace Pardew grew with fans protesting against the 53-year-old during matches.

Prior to October, Newcastle had only won six of their 28 fixtures this calendar year before their fortunes turned with league victories at home to Leicester and away to Tottenham.

Wednesday's impressive 2-0 Carling Cup fourth round win at holders Manchester City has continued the positive momentum being built at the club - something Barton believes proves that the players were always in support of Pardew even through the bad times.

He told TalkSPORT: 'Even in their hardest moments, like Stoke away, when the pressure was really on, there was still that effort and commitment.

'I don't think the players will turn their back on him [Alan Pardew], he took a lot of them there. They believed in what he was trying to do.'
