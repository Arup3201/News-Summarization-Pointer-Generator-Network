Five months ago, MailOnline teamed up with Select Model Management to search for the 'new 
faces' of 2013. Entries came in the thousands and now the winners
have finally been revealed.

Select is responsible for scouting out the likes of David Gandy, Agyness Deyn, Sarah Ann Macklin, Oliver Cheshire  and Stella Tennant and turning them into some of the world's most recognisable faces.

Could the womens' winner Madi Gray, 15, from North London, be joining them on the catwalk in a couple of years?

Entered by her relatives, Madi will, for the time being, do a couple of shoots a year in the school holidays.

She joins the 'sneak preview' section of the agency, for girls under the age of 16.

'The underage girls don’t "work" like full-time models, but we do get them test shoots
during their school holidays to get them a bit of experience and to 
build their books,' explains Lucy Quick of Select.

'We will fit in shoots around her school holidays for the next year or so, with the younger girls, they tend to shoot around 4 or 5 times a year, less if they have a lot of school work on.

'When they are so young we are really only getting them nice shoots to help get them used to working with teams and being behind the camera.

'We are very careful about the clients that we work with, and have teams of photographers and stylists that we have met and worked with for years.

Sneak preview: Select chose Madi (pictured, left, in the shot her parents entered into the competition) because, they say, she is naturally beautiful with a 'cool, unique' look. She will now join their 'sneak preview' section and do a few shoots a year in school holidays

'With the younger girls we are 
especially careful and make sure that the teams they are working with 
are professional and easy to work with. The clients that we work with on
the younger/ teen division are companies like Boden and Tammy girl, who 
are used to working with teenagers.

'We
also follow all industry guidelines regarding working hours and proper 
refreshments. In most cases parents accompany their daughters to shoots,
especially the first few, but if they are unable to do so we provide 
chaperones if necessary.'

Speaking about their winner, Lucy said: 'We chose Madi because she is naturally beautiful with a cool and unique look.

'Although she is still very young she definitely has the potential to be a future star.'

Madi was born in New Zealand and lived for six years in both Sydney and Singapore before settling with her family in North London.

She is interested in photography, design and styling and plays football, as well as competing in cross-country running for her school and the borough of Camden.

The winner in the men's category is 22-year-old Jack Holder.

Speaking about the winner, Andrew Garratt of Select Model Management, said: 'We picked Jack because of his strong and interesting masculine look.

'He isn’t your generic looking kid, he has slight quirky features: full lips, big eyes, killer cheekbones, small nose.'

'He had a great body which helps too.

'There is a lack of strong blond male models in the industry at the minute so Jack really fits the bill.

'He
just turned 22 so he is in a great age bracket – this means he can 
cross over to the big money clients as well as being a relevant new face
and pick up editorial.

Toned: Jack's 'great physique' also helped win judges over

Photogenic: A spokesman for Select said: 'He isn't your generic looking kid - he has slight quirky features (full lips, big eyes, killer cheekbones, small nose), which all make for a pleasing aesthetic'

International appeal: Select hope that Jack will work all over the world

As well as modelling Jack is training in banking and is a keen sportsman too.

'Going forward Jack will shoot loads of editorial to boost his exposure and from there he will visit different markets abroad,' added the spokesman.

Speaking about his victory, Jack told MailOnline: 'I'm completely shocked to have won and I'm really excited about working with Select.

'It's such an amazing feeling and I can't wait to see what the next few months have in store for me.'
