Crystal Palace are set to complete a £4million move for Jordon Mutch.

The former Cardiff midfielder has failed to make an impact Queens Park Rangers since his move in the summer and has been freed to leave by manager Harry Redknapp.

And Palace boss Alan Pardew has moved quickly to take Mutch ahead of next week's transfer deadline and is hoping to complete a deal by the weekend.

QPR are understood to have asked for Fraizer Campbell as part of the deal that will take Mutch to Palace. Redknapp is looking for another striker as he streamlines his squad. 

Palace are also trying to complete a move for Newcastle striker Shola Ameobi, but face late competition from QPR.

Ameobi held talks with Palace on Tuesday as Pardew looks to reunite himself with the experienced centre-forward.

Palace have allowed midfielder Stuart O'Keefe to join Cardiff.
