Leading crime writer Lynda La Plante has branded BBC chiefs ‘retards’ who have a vendetta against her.

The 69-year-old creator of ITV’s Prime Suspect launched her shock rant at a literature festival in Dubai this weekend, accusing the BBC of choosing trendier rivals over her.

Soliciting gasps for her language, she said: ‘So many of them at the BBC are retards.

Outburst: Leading crime writer Lynda La Plante has branded BBC chiefs ¿retards¿ who have a vendetta against her

'I mean, to get something from the BBC commissioners… This year I have had six projects turned down.

'They seem to have an absolute angst against me and yet Paul Abbott  [the creator of Channel 4’s Shameless] is up there.

‘I have done much more work than Paul Abbott. They are just retards and yet we have to deal with them all the time. They hate me.’

Her extraordinary outburst is the second time she has ranted about the BBC’s ‘very depressing’ commissioning policy.

Preferred: Lynda La Plante claimed Paul Abbott was favoured over her - despite the Shameless creator barely working for the BBC since State Of Play aired in 2003

Three years ago she complained the Corporation would rather opt for a Muslim teenager’s script over hers, saying: ‘If my name were Usafi Iqbadal and I was 19, then they’d probably bring me in and talk.’

However, her complaints about  Mr Abbott seem misplaced as the Burnley-born writer has barely worked for the BBC since his political thriller State Of Play aired in 2003.

He was commissioned to write a second series in 2006 but it was abandoned.

He wrote the three-part BBC1 mini-series Exile two years ago, and a one-off drama for BBC3.

Miss La Plante has previously complained it took ‘a retinue of people’ to get in touch with ‘the god Ben Stephenson’ – the BBC’s head of drama commissioning.

Creator: Crime writer Lynda La Plante is best known as being behind hit ITV show Prime Suspect which starred Helen Mirren
