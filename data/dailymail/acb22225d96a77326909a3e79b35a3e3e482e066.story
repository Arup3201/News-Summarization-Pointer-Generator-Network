Roy Keane has admitted he cannot see himself managing Manchester United... at least not while Sir Alex Ferguson is associated with the club.

The former United midfielder spectacularly fell out with legendary boss Ferguson in 2005 after an MUTV interview he did about his team-mates and left the Old Trafford club under a cloud.

And he the Irishman has not been quiet in his criticism of his former boss in his new autobiography, Roy Keane: The Second Half.

Roy Keane claims he will never manage Manchester United while Sir Alex Ferguson is involved with the club due to the breakdown in their relationship since the midfielder left Old Trafford in 2005 after a bust-up 

The pair have taken pot shots at one other in their respective books and have failed to repair their relationship

When asked if Keane could ever see himself managing United in the future, Keane told The Telegraph firmly: 'Not if Ferguson's still around.'

Seemingly, the relationship between the pair is still so fractious that Keane could not take to the dugout at a club for whom he made 480 league appearances between 1993 and 2005 while Ferguson is still in any way involved at United.

Keane, 43, has managed Sunderland and Ipswich Town, as well as currently being assistant boss at both the Republic of Ireland and Aston Villa, and has admitted he does envisage returning to coaching in the future.

But it appears he is not eyeing the touchline at Old Trafford as his next venture into management.

Keane has not made any secret of his dislike for his former mentor, speaking candidly in both interviews and his book about his disdain for Ferguson. 

At the press conference for the unveiling of his new book, Keane took aim at his old manager once more.

He was asked if he would ever forgive Ferguson. 'Good question,' he said. 'Not sure. Football's a small world and eventually you think you might cross paths again.

'The problem I had, when you're writing and reflecting on something … we had our disagreement … but it's afterwards when people start coming out with all sorts of nonsense.

'We had a great team that entertained a lot of people. So to criticise people like that, not just me, people who brought him a lot of success, I thought it was wrong.'

And then the killer line from Keane. 'He made his millions, got his statue, got a stand named after him,' he said. 'But to criticise people who brought him success was just wrong.'

It seems Louis van Gaal does not need to worry about Keane replacing him any time soon.
