Billionaire Hans Kristian Rausing's in-laws have vowed to stand by him as he's charged with preventing 'the lawful and decent burial' of his wife Eva, insisting they love the Tetra Pak heir 'unconditionally'.

After initially arresting him on suspicion of murder, Scotland Yard announced yesterday that Rausing, 49, had been charged with preventing Eva Rausing's burial after it 
emerged he may have lived with his wife's body in their £70 million Belgravia 
mansion for a week or more after she died of a suspected drugs overdose.

But Mrs Rausing's father Tom Kemeny is refusing to blame his son-in-law. In a statement he has paid tribute to 'a beautiful, 
generous, and fun daughter, wife, mother, sister and aunt' and described Mr Rausing as his 'son'.

days when her body was found on July 9

Mr Rausing, who has been recovering 
in a secure hospital after being stopped by police driving erratically 
in Wandsworth last week, will now appear before magistrates today.

Eva and Hans were married in London¿s Swedish Church by the Archbishop of Sweden in 1992

Last night a spokesman for the 
Metropolitan Police said: 'Hans Kristian Rausing, of Cadogan Place, SW1,
was today charged with preventing the lawful and decent burial of the 
body of Eva Rausing on or before 9 July 2012.

'He will appear in custody at West 
London Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 18 July.' Police are treating the
death of Mrs Rausing as 'unexplained' and a post-mortem examination 
held last week failed to establish a formal cause of death.

An inquest into the mother-of-four's death opened at Westminster Coroner's Court on Friday.

Mrs Rausing's body was only 
discovered after officers stopped her husband on suspicion of driving 
under the influence of drugs or alcohol and after finding drugs in his 
car, they searched the couple's home .

Yesterday Mrs Rausing's devastated 
father, Tom Kemeny, said his daughter had interrupted her own drug 
treatment to help her husband, who is heir to a £5.4 billion fortune.

He wrote: 'At the time of her death 
her overriding concern was for the safety of her beloved husband, for 
whom she interrupted her own treatment to return to London in an attempt
to take him back with her to California, but tragically to no avail.

Family event: Eva's family said they hoped her death would raise awareness of drug addiction and financial support for those blighted by it.

'Eva and Hans Kristian adored each 
other and their four beautiful children. When not in London they would 
have family holidays with their cousins and extended family, without any
glitz or glamour.

'Eva and Hans Kristian were a devoted and loving couple for the 21 years they spent together.

'They benefited thousands of lives through their personal involvement and philanthropic activities.

'They bravely battled their demons 
and supported each other and Eva will be a devastating loss to our 
beloved 'son' Hans Kristian, whom we love unconditionally with all our 
hearts.' The couple's drug problems have been widely reported.

In 2008 they were investigated by police over drugs but the prosecution was formally discontinued.

In a joint statement, Mrs Rausing's 
family said they hoped her death would raise awareness of drug addiction
and financial support for those blighted by it.

They said: 'The Kemeny family is 
deeply distressed by the tragedy of their daughter Eva's death and have 
seen the widespread worldwide media coverage of her difficulties over 
the last few days.

'Eva would have wanted the memory of 
her life to be used to benefit others facing similar addiction 
challenges in their lives. The Kemeny family hopes this tribute will be 
used to draw attention to the tragedy of drug addiction and to generate 
awareness and financial support for this cause in the future. In due 
course they will launch a foundation.'

In a statement released alongside the 
tribute, he said: 'We believe her tragic death highlights the scourge of
drugs and that it does not matter how rich, intelligent or beautiful 
you are, you can still be impacted and overcome by this terrible 
disease.'

The tribute also went into great detail about Mrs Rausing's childhood, before paying tribute to her sharp wit and intelligence.

It also quotes Nick Barton, chief 
executive of Action on Addiction, as saying: 'Eva worked tirelessly for 
years, without any desire for public recognition and despite her own 
health issues, to help people and charities in the addiction field 
through her wonderfully generous support.'

Billionaire Hans Kristian Rausing may have lived with his wife Eva's dead body for up to four days before it was discovered by police

Investigators were alerted to Mrs 
Rausing's body by a strong smell of decomposition after arriving at the 
sprawling £70million Georgian mansion several hours after arresting her 
husband.

They now suspect Mrs Rausing, 48, may have died as long as four weeks before the grim discovery a week ago.

They are studying CCTV, banking and 
phone records, as well as statements from friends and neighbours, to try
to identify her last movements.

Hans Kristian Rausing, 49, remained in
a secure hospital last night, receiving treatment for a mental 
breakdown and drugs withdrawal.

Mr Rausing, whose fortune came from 
the £4.5billion Tetra Pak packaging empire, remains under arrest on 
suspicion of murdering his wife but cannot be interviewed until declared
fit by medical staff.

The advanced decomposition of her body
has made the task of identifying how she died more difficult for police
and pathology staff.

An initial post-mortem examination 
last week failed to find a cause of death and a second may take place 
this week on the instructions of her husband’s legal team.

Meanwhile 
investigators are waiting for the detailed results of a battery of 
toxicology tests that could indicate what role was played by drugs and 
alcohol.

The sensitive tests will also help pinpoint exactly when she 
died by measuring levels of chemicals produced naturally after death.

The news came as unsent emails composed by Mrs Rausing emerged showing her desperate battle with drugs and fear of death.

In
one, written in January 2010 and published in a Sunday newspaper, she 
appealed for help to her husband’s father Hans, who built the family 
fortune.

She said: ‘I 
realise that I will die and there is a part of me that desperately does 
not want to die and wants to fight, fight, fight but I am sliding and I 
am desperately calling to you for help.

'If nothing changes I will die, 
Hans. I just felt that I did not want to die without trying everything 
that I possibly could to reach you and to ask you to please help me.

‘Your son feels very, very hopeless. Although I stick close to him, I am losing my grip because I am weakening.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
