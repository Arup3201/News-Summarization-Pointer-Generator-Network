Two security guards were attacked by a group of men who snuck onto the set of Carey Mulligan's new film, Far From The Madding Crowd.

The guards are believed to have challenged a group of five men when they went through a cordon on the film set at Sherborne Abbey in Dorset.

They were beaten up before the men ran away.

Mulligan and co-stars Tom Sturridge and Michael Sheen are filming the adaptation of the Thomas Hardy classic in the Dorset town.

Shops outside the abbey have been given a period makeover and some areas have been cordoned off to the public for filming.

One guard, a 59-year-old man from Devizes, Wiltshire, suffered bruising and cuts to his body and was taken to Yeovil Hospital for treatment.

The second guard, a 47-year-old man from Lewes, East Sussex, suffered swelling to his face and body in the attack at about 1am on Sunday.

Detective Constable Gerald Marchant said: 'This was an unprovoked attack that left both men requiring treatment.'

It is thought the five men broke onto the set after leaving a local pub, the Evening Standard reported.

Hours before the attack, Mulligan, 28, was pictured in character as Hardy's Bathsheba Everdene - the West Country heiress loved by three men.

The actress was seen in period costume and wore a long navy blue coat.

Carey revealed earlier this week that she was finding the shooting of the new project 'exhausting', but hugely rewarding.

She said: 'I'm getting picked up at 5.30 in the morning tomorrow - to Dorset. I am so tired!

'I am enjoying it so much, it's brilliant. It's outside a lot.

'Seventy per cent of the film is fields, exteriors and outdoorsy things, which is really great but it's cold and really tiring.'
