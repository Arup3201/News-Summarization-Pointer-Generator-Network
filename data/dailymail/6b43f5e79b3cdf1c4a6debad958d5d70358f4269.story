Cristiano Ronaldo could have been lining up with Lionel Messi at Barcelona had Real Madrid not held their nerve over his £80million move from Manchester United.

The Portuguese was almost priced out of a switch to the capital club as Florentino Perez felt the striker was too expensive.

That is the startling admission by the club's former president Ramon Calderon, who claims his successor wasn't prepared to pay United £80million for the star.

The Portuguese has been in flying form for the Champions League winners over the last two years

Calderon told Sky Sports that it was he who instigated initial discussions before Perez almost pulled the plug in 2009.

Ronaldo's five years at the Bernabeu have been an undisputed success - topped off notably last season when he won the Champions League and Ballon d'Or.

But that may never have come to happen.  

'When Florentino became president and came to the club, he wanted to break (negotiations). He thought it was very expensive,' Calderon said on the Revista Show. 

'He knew he was a good player but thought he wasn't worth that amount of money. That was a problem he had at the beginning with Cristiano, who knew that.'

Calderon claims that Perez found the £80million price tag set by Manchester United too expensive 

Ronaldo could have lined up with Lionel Messi at Barcelona but had his heart set on a move to Real Madrid 

And it may have even been the case that Madrid's arch rivals Barcelona  pinched Ronaldo under their noses - but were scuppered by the player's desire to move to the Spanish capital.

'They offered him to Barcelona among other clubs. Barcelona said "okay, we are prepared to pay what you are asking". The important thing is that the player said "no, Real Madrid or nothing",' he added.

'I'm very proud that he came, very proud what he's doing. I was there at the moment the transfer could be done, anyone would have done the same.'
