A British soldier who suffered life-changing injuries while serving in Afghanistan after being hit by a roadside bomb has been found dead at his home in Manchester.

Private Bradley Paul, 23, was heading up a supply patrol in Helmand Province in 2012 when an explosion severed an artery in his neck and left him with multiple fractures.

He was airlifted back to the UK and spent 12 months recovering, but also began fighting an 'internal struggle' to come to terms with his injuries, his commanding officer Captain Chris Middleton said.

Private Bradley Paul, 23, had an artery in his neck severed and sustained several fractures after being hit with an IED while serving in Afghanistan, and was medically discharged from the Army a year later

Private Paul, who served with the 1st Battalion, The Mercian Regiment, was medically discharged from the Army last year, and  found dead at home in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, last week.

Police say he was found with a neck injury and the death is not being treated as suspicious.

Private Paul's family say they are now working to raise awareness of mental health issues facing former soldiers, and are appealing for donations to fund a full military funeral.

They have so far raised £8,000, and say they have been overwhelmed by messages of support.

In a message posted on the Gofundme website, Private Paul’s mother, Sam Paul, said that her son would be ‘smiling down’ if he could see the outpouring of emotion.

After being wounded Mr Bradley was flown to the UK where he spent 12 months recovering. Despite his progress, he was found dead at his home in Manchester with a neck injury

She said: 'I’m overwhelmed b

y all the donations and messages on this page. Thank you so much every one of you on behalf of Brad’s family. 

'I know Brad will be smiling down on you all to see how loved he is. Thank you again and much love to you all.'

His aunt, Lauraine Cover, thanked Private Paul’s commanding officer in Afghanistan, Captain Chris Middleton, for launching the appeal.

She added: 'Thanks to all the caring, generous people who have donated, you are all amazing.'

The family are also promoting the work of charity Combat Stress, which works to provide clinical support and treatment for veterans with psychological wounds.
