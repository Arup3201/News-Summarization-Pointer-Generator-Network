A mother is 'disgusted' with Sainsbury's after she gave her one-year-old daughter a chicken kiev and found an inch-long shard of saw blade embedded in it.

Sophie Perks bought the ready meal from her local supermarket as a quick dinner for her child Maddison-Faithe.

But as the 22-year-old cut the meal up on her daughter's high chair plate she was stunned when her knife hit a sharp slither of razor-sharp metal.

Shock discovery: Sophie Perks, 22, with her partner Jordan Langstaff, 22, and daughter Madison-Faith, who was almost fed a chicken kiev containing a saw blade

Chilling: This is the inch-long shard found embedded in the meal, which looks similar to a hacksaw blade

When she examined the food she was shocked when she discovered a jagged shard of metal.

The mother-of-one was enraged when she returned to the branch in Church Gresley, Derbyshire, to find they could offer no explanation for how the blade got into the dish.

She was offered another pack of Â£2.50 kievs as an apology for the incident which happened on October 5.

The data manager at a cancer research firm is calling for an urgent investigation into the source of the blade - to make sure no one else suffers the same fate.

Miss Perks, of Swadlincote, Derbyshire said: 'I was in a rush that evening because it was my sister Molly's 18th birthday in Tamworth and so we hadn't got any time to go shopping.

Offending ready meal: Miss Perks had bought the twin-pack of fresh kievs from a nearby Sainsbury's local as a quick dinner for her one-year-old daughter, but felt the metal when she cut into it

'I popped in to the store and grabbed a two pack of kievs, the fresh ones not frozen, so my daughter could have dinner.

Apology: Sainsbury's say they have launched an investigation and the store the family bought it from gave her two more free

'When we got home I cooked them both and when they were done I cut one up on Maddison's plate and heard a clink when my knife hit something.

'I picked it up to check what had made the noise and the razor blade fell from the bottom.

'I was disgusted, if I hadn't heard the clunk I would have just served it up - I dread to think what could have happened.

'I took it back to the shop and the deputy manager was very apologetic, they gave me some new ones, which I checked in the shop and said the manager would contact me.

'When he did all he could say was that they could only offer their sincere apologies and were looking into the matter.

'I wanted to know how it got in there but they couldn't tell me.

'This needs to be looked into as soon as possible. If it is because of something from the manufacture or the machines then there needs to be a recall.

'I dread to think what could have happened.

'I will never be shopping at Sainsbury's again, it puts you off, if they could have offered an explanation or made it clear it would never happen again I might, but not now.'

The supermarket giant is now investigating the claims.

A Sainsbury's spokeswoman said: 'We have started a thorough investigation and apologised to Miss Perks for the inconvenience caused.

'Incidents like this are extremely rare as we have the highest standards and carry out quality control checks at all stages of production.'
