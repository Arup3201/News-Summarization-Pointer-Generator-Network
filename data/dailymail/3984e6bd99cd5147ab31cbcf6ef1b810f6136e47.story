A teenager  has told of the horrifying moment he witnessed his best friend being mauled by a five metre shark - and only survived when he fired his spear-gun into the beast's mouth.

Matt Pullella went spearfishing with Jay Muscat at Cheynes Beach on the West Australian coast, about 70km east of Albany, in December last year when they were attacked from behind by the Great White.

Matt saw how the shark fatally bit his friend's leg and seconds later came after him.

It was thanks to his quick thinking that Matt was able to save himself from the same fate as his friend, by firing his spear gun into the mouth of the shark which he believed was coming back to attack him.

The shark first attacked Jay then went after Matt seconds later

In an interview with Nine Network's A Current Affair on Wednesday night, Matt says he was feeling a little 'on edge' just before he went diving with Jay.

'Usually you're relaxed before a dive but I wasn't relaxed at all,' he said.

But after being comforted by Jay, the pair dove into Cheyne Beach together - a usual diving spot for the two best friends.

As they went deeper into the waters Matt felt a huge force coming from behind. The two 17-year-olds were unexpectedly attacked from behind by the shark.

The boys were at Cheynes Beach on the West Australian coast, around 70km east of Albany

Cheyne Beach was a usual diving spot for the two best friends.

Despite the terrifying ordeal, Matt is determined to get back into the water

Matt says he initially had no idea what had just happened. 

'I thought I was hit by a boat or dolphin,' he said.

'There was a lot of blood and then I saw this shark hanging off Jay.'

Matt tried to swim away but through the sea of blood, he could see 'rows and rows of big white teeth'.

'I looked back and coming through the blood was this set of jaws... swimming straight at me,' he said.

'It was in a space of 10 seconds that everything people told me came flashing through my head.' 

Matt recalled thinking that he had to shoot the shark in the nose as he was told 'it was the most sensitive part of the shark'.

'But it didn't give me that option so I just pointed my gun and straight up its mouth,' he said.

'So I just shot the gun straight down its throat, into its guts.'

It was then Matt's chance to escape, swimming 30 metres back to shore and knowing deep down that his friend may not survive.

Jay died from the a severed artery in his leg and despite the terrifying ordeal, Matt is determined to get back into the water.

'There is a bit of madness to it but you can't stop something you love,' he said.
