Builders are hiring Portuguese bricklayers on £1,000 a week because not enough Britons can do the job.

Skilled workers are in such short supply they can demand double the normal day rate of £100.

A month ago the Mail revealed that a similar labour shortage had forced the UK’s biggest sandwich manufacturer to recruit in Hungary because it could not fill its production line with local workers.

Shortage: Builders are hiring Portuguese bricklayers on £1,000 a week because not enough Britons can do the job and as skilled workers are in such short supply they can demand double the normal day rate of £100

Portugal has become a hot spot for builders while energy firms are hiring Spanish engineers, according to James Hick of recruiters Manpower.

‘There is a severe shortage of skilled tradespeople in Britain – bricklayers, plumbers, electricians, mechanical engineers, HGV drivers,’ he added. ‘Where they were paying £500 a week at the beginning of the year, the demand for those skills means they are now paying £1,000 a week.

‘That pressure on skills is huge, particularly in the construction industry in the South East and London.’

He accused UK firms of halting training schemes in the downturn and being left short when construction picked up.

‘That is not something that can be resolved quickly, but companies need people who can work now, so they have had to put up pay and look elsewhere’, he added.

Hiring: A month ago the it was revealed that a similar labour shortage  forced the UK’s biggest sandwich manufacturer Greencore to recruit in Hungary because it could not fill its production line with local workers

Workers: Greencore staff hard at work in one of their factories - but bosses are struggling to find people who want to work in its new £35 million factory in Northampton, which is due to open in 2016

Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley in West Yorkshire, said: ‘It is a sad state of affairs when people in this country are not capable of doing the jobs that other people can. That is why the Government is right to focus on apprenticeships, instead of sending people on a conveyer belt to university on a course which will be of no use to them.

‘Apprenticeships will teach people the skills that are needed, so that we do not need to go abroad for them.’

Mark Dicks, of Guirard & Dicks, a bricklaying firm in London, said half of his annual recruits were from abroad, chiefly Ukraine and Poland, and they were able to insist on £200 a day. ‘If it was not for Eastern Europeans coming over there would be a bigger shortage,’ said Mr Dicks.

Hiring: It was reported that high street chain Next was hiring thousands of cheap Eastern European workers to work in South Elmsall, West Yorkshire, where unemployment is high

‘It is just the younger generation, they have grown up with computers. It died off probably because the money was not very good either.’ Malcolm Thorpe of the Guild of Bricklayers said £1,000 a week was a ‘ridiculous’ wage. He added: ‘If we carried on continually training then we would be okay. The first thing that goes is training.’

Manpower referenced a survey which found one in three large London construction firms have had to turn down bidding opportunities because of a shortage of skilled workers. 

Last month, the Mail reported that hospitals were hiring hundreds of nurses from Portugal without properly checking their English. It was also reported that Next was hiring thousands of cheap Eastern European workers to work in South Elmsall, West Yorkshire, where unemployment is high.

Viewpoint: Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley in West Yorkshire, said the Government 'is right to focus on apprenticeships', while Work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith has said the benefits system encourages skills shortages by allowing people to live comfortably without work

An agency based in Warsaw claimed the firm, run by Conservative peer Lord Wolfson, has already taken on 7,000 Poles. Work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith has said the benefits system encourages skills shortages by allowing people to live comfortably without work.

Business Secretary Vince Cable will announce today that the Government has fulfilled its commitment to starting two million apprenticeships in this Parliament.

A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ‘Government-led efforts over the past four years have got Britain building, creating thousands of jobs. In November, ministers agreed with housebuilders to create tens of thousands of jobs and apprenticeships on sites across the country, to nurture home-grown talent for many years to come.’

The unemployment rate in Portugal – at 14.6 per cent – is far higher than the UK’s 6 per cent. The average annual salary is £10,000 compared with £26,500 here.
