While America was watching the midterm election results come in, commentators on CNN were doing a terrible job pretending to be big fans of the Microsoft Surface Pro 3. 

Microsoft gave commentators on the network tablets to use throughout the night, but some of the reporters were seen blatantly typing away on their Mac products half concealed by their provided PC gadget.

According to a source who was at the CNN studios for yesterday's coverage, the whole team wasn't exactly excited at the prospect of having to use Microsoft devices. 

Jake Tapper is a Mac: CNN's Chief Washington Correspondent was seen typing away on his iPad during election night coverage, behind a  Microsoft-provided Surface Pro 3

Can you spot the iPad? Political contributor Ana Navarro used a Surface Pro to indiscreetly hold up her iPad during Tuesday night's election coverage

'There's going to be no personal digital devices allowed on set today or tonight,' a CNN producer told guests and their handlers gathered in the network's Washington, D.C. 'green room' during a 5:00 p.m. broadcast. Apparently that rule wasn't followed by everyone.

Camera angles exposed CNN's chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper as a Mac user, indiscreetly typing on his iPad from behind his free Surface Pro, while political contributor Ana Navarro used her tablet as a stand for her Apple device. 

'They're just not allowing anybody to bring their own. Sorry about that.'

The producer said she herself was an Apple devotee.

'I had Macs for ages and then had to switch to PCs,' she explained. 'Now I’m back to iPads and Macs again, and I just love it.'

A press flack for former Republican Speaker of the House News Gingrich piped up from a chair.

'Newt's not gonna like this,' he said. 'It's gonna take his email forever to load on that thing. This ought to be interesting.'

As Gingrich walked down a hallway toward CNN's broadcast studio, he was seen fiddling with an iPhone. 

A representative for CNN said that the Microsoft tablets used on election night coverage were 'not a product placement deal' and that reporters were not barred from bringing their own devices.

'Surface tablets were provided at each seat to give guests, contributors, and CNN talent real-time election results through "My Magic Wall" - an application optimized for Internet Explorer. 

'While panelists rotated throughout the night, the tablets remained in place. Talent brought with them to the studio their own personal devices for email and social media,' the spokesman said. 

When Microsoft first launched their tablet, they ran a series of ads showing all of the things the Surface Pro could do (like stand up with a kickstand)  that an iPad couldn't. 

But it appears they are now focusing their efforts on attacking Apple's sales of the Macbook Air - their slimmest and lightest laptop, with a new commercial advertising campaign.  

This latest failure to market Microsoft's tablet comes after the company struck a $400million deal to supply the NFL with their tablets.

But the commentators were not so good at concealing their iPads which they used behind the competitor tablets
