Mr Hill will be buried with full military honours in Sedgefield today

A former face of Pears soap who grew up to be a Second World War hero has died at the age of 91.

Johnny Hill was three years old when he was spotted on Blackpool's promenade by a photographer looking for models.

Curly-haired Johnny and his older brother Ron posed in togas for the 1924 advert, which was displayed in pharmacies and billboards across Britain and took pride of place on their parents' living room wall.

His son Geoff told the Independent: 
'They said they hated it. You can see from the picture that there was a 
little bit of apprehension on their faces.

'When
they used to take him around the town he used to get recognised and it 
made him embarrassed. According to my dad he never got any money - only a
year's supply of soap.'

Despite his embarrassment, Mr Hill remained a lifelong user of the brand.

He grew up to storm the beaches 
of Normandy on D-Day and to be one of the liberators of the Nazi 
concentration camp at Belsen.

After leaving school, he took up an apprenticeship as a Capstan lathe operator at a tool making factory.

The factory was destroyed by bombs at the beginning of the Second World War, killing many of his friends.

Mr Hill suffered a nervous breakdown but went on to join the Royal Army Service Corp in 1941.

During his training at Sedgefield, County Durham, he met his wife Rachel Stubbs.

They married at St Edmund's Church in the town in 1943, where Mr Hill will be buried with full military honours today.

As well as D-Day and the discovery of Belsen, Mr Hill was among the troops that liberated Antwerp.

He later survived a V2 rocket attack and went on to settle in Sedgefield with his wife and two children, Geoff and Joyce.

He also leaves five grandchildren and six great-grandchildren, reports The Northern Echo.
