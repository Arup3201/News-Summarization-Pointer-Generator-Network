Andy Murray moved closer to booking his place in the end-of-season ATP Tour Finals by reaching the final of the Erste Open in Vienna on Saturday.

The 27-year-old Scot produced a dominant second-set performance to see off Serbian Viktor Troicki 6-4 6-3 in their last-four clash.

Murray will move into the eighth and final qualifying place for London if he wins in Vienna, with only tournaments in Valencia and Paris to come.

Murray shared early breaks with world number 127 Troicki before breaking his opponent again to claim the opening set.

He stepped up a gear at the start of the second, breaking Troicki immediately and denying his opponent any opportunities to break back before breaking for a second time to secure the match.

Murray started this week ranked ninth in the race to the Finals, 25 points behind Milos Raonic, who lost in the first round of the Kremlin Cup in Moscow.

David Ferrer will be Murray's opponent in the final in Austria on Sunday after the Spaniard beat German Philipp Kohlschreiber in a third-set tie-break.
