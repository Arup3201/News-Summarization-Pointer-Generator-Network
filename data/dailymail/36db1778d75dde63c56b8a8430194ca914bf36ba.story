The heartbroken fiancée of a man who was killed in a mysterious motorcycle crash has appealed for help after police failed to solve the case.

Rebecca Gregory, 22, believes her husband-to-be Brett Hames, 24, died after another vehicle forced him off the road and then fled the scene.

Before he died Mr Hames said: 'I thought I was going to hit the car' but nobody has come forward to admit they were involved in the incident near Sutton-in-Craven, North Yorkshire on December 5.

Detectives believe he died after he was forced to avoid a collision with another vehicle when he crashed, but police have been unable to trace the driver.

Mystery: This is the isolated North Yorkshire road where Mr Hames died on December 5 and he had said that he had to avoid a car in the moments before his crash

His heartbroken partner Rebecca Gregory, 22, is appealing for the person to come forward to finally give her the vital answers to how her partner of seven years lost his life.

Police and Brett's family are also backing her campaign, which has included a Facebook page and posters put up across the Pennines.

Describing what happened on the day she died, she said: 'I was waiting for him to come back to our home and I knew when it got to five o'clock that something was not right.

'I kept looking at the window, waiting for Brett's motorbike to pull in but it was a police officer who turned up instead and told me that he had been in an accident.

'I rushed to hospital and waited for news from the surgeons but they just came out and told us that there was nothing they could do. I was devastated.'

North Yorkshire Police have received several responses after issuing an appeal for witnesses.

But more are needed to piece together the circumstances around the accident.

Mis Gregory said: 'I tried in December to find the driver but nothing came of it and it just strengthened my resolve to try and find them.

'I'm not sure how I will feel if the driver came forward but I will know when it happens.

'All I know is that I will have made Brett proud.'

Rebecca, then 15, asked Brett out and they were inseparable.

She said: 'Brett was absolutely wonderful - He had the greatest sense of humour and he was such a loving person.

'Every time I was ever down or feeling upset, he'd always do his best to cheer me up by taking me to see the pigs near to us.

'He was such an animal lover and a lover of everything in general.

'He had such a massive impact on anyone who came into contact with him and everybody has told me that since he died.'

Traffic constable Dave Seavers, of the North Yorkshire force's major collision investigation unit, is still looking for anyone who saw a car or bike driving along Pole Road at around 2pm on December 5.

He said: 'It is vital we find out exactly what happened to cause Brett to come off his motorbike. Brett's loved ones deserve to know how he lost his life'.

Those with information are being asked to either e-mail the traffic police on mcit@northyorkshire.pnn.uk or call the police non-emergency number on 101, asking for the North Yorkshire force and the major collision investigation team. The reference number for the incident is 12140210210.
