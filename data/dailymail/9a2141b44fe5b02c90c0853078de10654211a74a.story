An abandoned puppy  left to fend for himself by the side of a railroad track in Los Angeles - got a well-deserved second chance in life when he recently rescued by the Hope For Paws organization.

The non-profit group was tipped off about the lonely young puppy - clearly abused and neglected - who was so scared of humans that he barked and got aggressive when anyone went near him.

In order to first gain the dog’s trust, the organization had to use a rescue leash to keep the puppy still long enough to prove that they weren't planning on harming him.

Finn was an abused and abandoned puppy in Los Angeles until the Hope For Paws organization took him in and gave him some TLC before finding him a permanent home

The puppy, who the volunteers named Finn, was taken to the Bark N’ Bitches compound for a warm wash and a period of recuperation and TLC

As the video uploaded by Hope for Paws founder Eldad Hagar shows, when a rescuer first tried to pet the dog he was quick to showed his teeth, but they soon gained his trust.

The timing of the Hope For Paws team couldn't have been any better, because as they drove off with young Finn, a high-speed train passed right through the area that the dog had been calling home.
