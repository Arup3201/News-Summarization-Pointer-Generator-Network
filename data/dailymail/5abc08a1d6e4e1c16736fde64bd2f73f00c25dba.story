An Italian pensioner aged 75 has been accused of being 'sex mad' - by his wife who is 50 years younger than him.

Elderly Efisio Manfrin appeared in court in Naples accused by his spouse of being a 'maniac that wanted sex all the time'.

And she told the court that the constant pressure to get into bed was driving her mad.

Naples in Italy where pensioner Efisio Manfrin, 75, has been accused by his 25-year-old wife of being a 'maniac that wanted sex all the time'

The two of them ended up before judges 
because police were called to a fight at the family home, and both 
accused the other of assault.

Wife Iglesia Guerero, 25, and originally from Cuba, said the fight was about his 'non-stop demands for nookie'.

But her husband hit back in the court row claiming the fight was over money.

He told court: 'The fight started because I realised she cared more about money than sex and affection.

'I thought the world of her when we met, and was flattered that she said she loved me.

'She told me she valued the fact I could make her laugh, and that I was much more interesting to talk to than younger men.

'Of course I gave her presents, and we had a normal sexual relationship, but when we married and she had access to my bank account, that all ended.

'She just wanted me to pay for everything and any attempt at affection was rejected.'

The couple had briefly split in 2012 when she moved back to Cuba but a month later she returned, and moved back with her husband but the rows got worse, and ended when she left for the day and he gave all her designer clothes to a charity shop.

There was a furious row, that ended with both sides calling the police and the pensioner being taken from the house and ordered to stay away until matters calmed down.

Both are now fighting it out in court, and the trial continues.Â
