Charged: David Renz allegedly stabbed a mother to death as she tried to attack him after he raped her 10-year-old daughter

An Upstate New York man who admitted to raping a 10-year-old girl before murdering her mother has been sentenced to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to possessing more than 11,000 images of child pornography, as well as roughly 1,100 videos in a case unrelated to the murders.

Federal sentencing guidelines recommend that 30-year-old David Renz be sentenced to 19 to 24 years in prison for the child pornography convictions. However, U.S. District Judge Norman Mordue went beyond the recommendation by imposing the 30-year sentence for crimes prosecutors described as 'pure evil.'

The murder of Lori Breshnahan - and the rape of her young daughter - occurred while Renz was awaiting trial for the child pornography charges, and was confined to his home and required to wear a monitoring device.

On March 14, 2013 - just six weeks after he'd been arrested for possessing child pornography - Renz removed his required electronic monitoring device and drove to the Great Northern Mann in Clay, New York, a suburb of Syracuse.

Once at the mall, Renz parked his car and walked around the parking lot, where he found Breshnahan - a school librarian - and her daughter getting into their vehicle.

Renz then forced his way into Breshahan's car using an air pistol he claimed was a real gun and forced her to drive to a remote area of the mall's parking lot where he bound both of his victims and - using a knife to cut a hole in her clothes - raped the young girl.

Prosecutors say Renz was trying to 
use cable ties to bind the woman to a headrest in her car when she 
fought back and shouted for the girl to bolt from the vehicle.

As the girl ran off and was rescued 
by a passing motorist, her mother was strangled and repeatedly stabbed 
in the head and chest, officials said. Renz was captured by police 
shortly after.

Weeks after the attack, a report by a
 federal judge found that the officers failed to do monthly checks on 
Renz that would have included inspection of the bracelet. Federal 
probation officers in Syracuse who were monitoring Renz were fired or 
demoted.

Renz pleaded guilty to the murder and rape charges last year.Â 

Authorities say that several of the child pornography videos depicted acts similar to the rape and murder for which Renz pleaded guilty.

'Let the defendant's other victims not 
be forgotten,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Lisa Fletcher said during Renz's sentencing hearing, according to Syracuse.com. 'Each and every child in each and every one of 
the defendant's 11,000 images and 1,100 videos for which he stands 
convicted, every single one of those children was used by David Renz to 
fuel his twisted interest in the exploitation of children. Every one of 
them is also his victim.'

Renz, whose hands and feet were shackled during the hearing, declined to comment when the judge offered him a chance to speak.

Fletcher asked for a sentence of 30 to 70 years, and asked that any sentence the judge imposed would run consecutively with whatever sentence Renz gets for Breshahan's murder.

Renz's attorney, Assistant federal 
Public Defender Randi Bianco, asked for a sentence within the sentencing
 guidelines of 19 to 24 years, citing the difficult life Renz has 
suffered as the result of a facial deformity.

Renz
 is expected to be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility 
of parole when he sentenced in Onondaga County court for the murder and 
rape convictions on May 16.

However,

 federal prosecutors currently are deciding whether to seek the death 
penalty against Renz by indicting him on a federal carjacking charge. If
 the feds seek the death penalty, Renz would be allowed to withdraw his 
guilty pleas in county court.
