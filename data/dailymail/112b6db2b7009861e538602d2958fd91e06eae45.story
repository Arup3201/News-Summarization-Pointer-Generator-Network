Sir Robert Edwards, the ‘father of IVF’ whose discovery helped millions of infertile couples have children, died yesterday aged 87.

Together with fellow Briton Patrick Steptoe, the Nobel Prize-winner pioneered the in vitro fertilisation technique that led to the birth of Louise Brown, the world’s first test-tube baby, on July 25, 1978.

The birth at Oldham General Hospital captured the imagination of the world after it was reported exclusively by the Daily Mail under the headline ‘And here she is . . . the Lovely Louise’.

With more than five million IVF babies born since, friends and colleagues said the modest Yorkshireman was a ‘true giant of the 20th century’. Around 180,000 IVF babies are born in Britain each year.

Professor Peter Braude, Emeritus 
Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at King’s College London, said: 
‘Few biologists have so positively and practically impacted on 
humankind.

‘Bob’s boundless energy, his 
innovative ideas, and his resilience despite the relentless criticism by
 naysayers, changed the lives of millions of ordinary people who now 
rejoice in the gift of their own child.

‘He leaves the world a much better place.’ 

Other experts in the fields of fertility compared him to pioneers such as Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein.

Dr Allan Pacey, chair of the British 
Fertility Society (BFS), which represents IVF clinics, said: ‘His work 
transformed our view of infertility from something that must be endured 
to a potentially treatable medical condition. He will be greatly missed 
and his contribution to humankind is immeasurable.

‘It is heartening to know that he 
received due acclaim for his work during his lifetime. The BFS considers
 his legacy to match that of Darwin, Curie and Einstein for their 
respective fields, and hopes his memory will live on for many years to 
come.’

Pioneering: Sir Robert's work resulted in the first test-tube baby, Louise Brown, who was born on 25 July 1978, in Oldham, Greater Manchester

Sir Robert, a father of five and a 
fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge, was awarded the Nobel Prize for 
Medicine in 2010 and knighted the following year.

After Miss Brown was born, Sir Robert and Dr Steptoe celebrated their achievement by drinking champagne out of plastic cups.

He remained in touch with Miss Brown 
throughout the ensuing years, and later attended her wedding to Wesley 
Mullinder. And in 2006, she gave birth to her son Cameron, who was 
conceived naturally.

Miss Brown, 34, last night joined the
 tributes to Sir Robert. She said: ‘It was really sad to hear the news 
today. I have always regarded Robert Edwards as like a grandfather to 
me. 

The Mail's report of the story in 1978

Lesley Brown made medical history nearly 35 years ago when she gave birth to Louise, the world’s first test-tube baby.

The event stunned the medical world and marked the start of a revolution in fertility treatment.

Mrs Brown and her husband, John, had been trying for a baby for nine years when they signed up to an experimental procedure, in vitro fertilisation.

She became pregnant at the first attempt, and 5lb 12oz Louise Joy Brown was born by caesarean section at Oldham General Hospital at 11.47pm on July 25, 1978.

The birth, which gave hope to countless infertile couples, captured the imagination of the world after it was reported exclusively by the Daily Mail.

The treatment involved an egg being removed from one of Mrs Brown’s ovaries with a probe before being mixed with her husband’s sperm in a petri dish – not a test tube. The resulting embryo was implanted in her womb two days later.

The Vatican said the treatment could have ‘grave consequences for humanity’ and even James Watson, the DNA pioneer, warned that the scientists were dabbling in infanticide. Some feared the baby would be abnormal.

Although other women had been implanted with fertilised eggs, this was the first pregnancy to go beyond a few weeks.

Four years later, Mrs Brown, who couldn’t become pregnant naturally because her fallopian tubes were blocked, conceived a second daughter, Natalie, by IVF.

Last June, Lesley Brown died suddenly aged 64 at Bristol Royal Infirmary after developing septicaemia while being treated in hospital for gallstones.

Her husband died from lung cancer nearly six years ago.

Louise, 34, wed nightclub doorman Wesley Mullinder in 2004, with Sir Robert in attendance, and in 2006 had her son Cameron, who was conceived naturally.

‘His work, along with Patrick 
Steptoe, has brought happiness and joy to millions of people all over 
the world by enabling them to have children.

‘I am glad that he lived long enough to be recognised with a Nobel Prize for his work.

‘His legacy will live on with all the IVF work being carried out throughout the world.

‘The thoughts of myself and my sister Natalie, who was also born through IVF, are with his family at this sad time.’

Her mother, Lesley Brown, was unable 
to conceive naturally because her fallopian tubes were blocked and had 
been trying for a baby for nine years when she signed up to what was 
then an experimental procedure.

As well as giving birth to Louise in 
1978, she had a second daughter, Natalie, using IVF four years later. 
Mrs Brown died last year.

Born in 1925 into a working class 
family in Batley, West Yorkshire, Sir Robert studied agriculture at 
Bangor University before switching to zoology as a mature student 
following his military service in the Second World War.

He started research on IVF in the 
Fifties and was driven by the belief that people had the right to 
receive help in having a family.

He once said: ‘I have seen how 
infertility is a cause of great and lasting human sadness. It demands 
treatment. The most important thing in life is having a child.’

However, the research he conducted 
with Dr Steptoe, who died in 1988, on artificial reproduction was 
bitterly opposed by the medical establishment and religious leaders and 
they were forced to seek private donations to fund their experiments.

Early efforts failed due to flawed 
hormone treatments. But in 1977 the pair tried a new procedure, which 
avoided hormone treatments and instead relied on precise timing. A year 
later, Louise was born.

The Daily Mail’s then editor, Sir 
David English, helped them to acquire Bourn Hall, near Cambridge, where 
in 1980 they established the world’s first IVF clinic. Mike Macnamee, 
chief executive of the Bourn Hall Clinic, said: ‘Bob Edwards is one of 
our greatest scientists. His inspirational work in the early Sixties led
 to a breakthrough that has enhanced the lives of millions of people 
worldwide. He is held in great affection by everyone who has worked with
 him and was treated by him.

‘For me personally, Bob was a great 
mentor, colleague and friend. It was a privilege to work with him, and 
his passing is a great loss to us all.’  Professor Lisa Jardine, chair 
of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which 
licences IVF clinics and research, said: ‘It is with great sadness that 
we have heard about the death of Professor Sir Robert Edwards.

‘Few scientists can say that their 
work has impacted on mankind in such a meaningful way. He was an 
exceptional man whose compassion and tenacity will be dearly missed.’

The award of the Nobel Prize – and 
prize money of nearly £1million to Sir Robert when it finally came in 
2010 – was considered by many to be long overdue.

Although the official reason for the 
long delay is not known, it has been suggested that Miss Brown giving 
birth to a healthy child played a significant part in the decision.

Nobel committee member Christer Hoog 
said: ‘It was of course very, very important that Louise Brown was 
healthy and that subsequent babies also were healthy.’

Sir Robert’s death followed a long illness. He leaves his wife Ruth, five daughters and 12 grandchildren.
