In June, after five years living in France, rugby golden boy Jonny Wilkinson finally put his seven-bedroom Northumberland mansion on the market.

But six months later the property still hasn't shifted, and the retired fly-half has now slashed the price by  £305,000 to £1.195m.

The reduction comes amid rumours that Jonny is moving back to the UK and he has been spotted house hunting in the Wiltshire countryside.

Jonny Wilkinson first put the luxury home on the market for £1.5m but it has now been reduced to £1.195m

The beautiful 19th-century property is set in five acres of gardens and grounds and is conveniently placed next to a golf course, perfect for anyone with a penchant for sport.

And that's not all on offer to sport fanatics - the property has its own heated swimming pool and adjoining leisure complex with a sauna and gym, which Wilkinson built in 2004 after being injured.

The star has credited his home leisure facilities for saving his career.

'My whole life was about doing rehab and gym work to try and stay fit and get back into my job. It became a bit of a retreat almost,' Wilkinson (pictured above in the gym) said of his home

'When I went through my injury period between 2004 and 2007, I just couldn't stay fit and I was struggling,' the star explained when he first put his house up for sale.

'It was then I decided to extend the property to include space for a gym and a swimming pool.

'It kind of saved my career. My whole life was about doing rehab and gym work to try and stay fit and get back into my job. It became a bit of a retreat almost.'

Jonny has also spoken about how much the house means to him.

The retired fly-half (pictured in the kitchen of the 19th-century mansion) said: 'The house is very special to me as it's where I spent the mainstay of my rugby career'

'The views go on forever. It's that kind of thing that I'm going to miss. It's that beautiful and that much of a privilege to live here,' he said.

'But at the same time, it's one of those things when suddenly your life takes shape in front of you and you have to move on.
