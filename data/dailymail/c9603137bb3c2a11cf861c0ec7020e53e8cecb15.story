One balmy evening in Cape Town, in the summer of 2010, a television camera followed Wayne Rooney from a football pitch.

England had just stumbled through a sterile draw with Algeria and their World Cup progress was under threat. The England followers started to protest at the abject display and suddenly Rooney became aware of their jeers. Briefly, he paused to sneer at the camera: ‘Nice to see your own fans booing you,’ he said. ‘That’s what loyal support is.’

The remark was caught by a pitch-side microphone and the subsequent outcry led the television news.

The team’s performance had been truly inept. High in the grandstand of the Cape Town Stadium, I tried to recall a more abject English result. ‘1066?’ offered a helpful neighbour. But somehow, Rooney’s reaction had made a wretched situation far worse.

He seemed to be suggesting that the fans had no right to criticise England’s miserable display. Their function was to applaud, to approve, to spend their money and to offer ‘loyal support’. Anything less smacked of treachery.

For the rest of their ill-starred tournament - i.e. two more matches - England players were pilloried for a whole range of perceived offences, from arrogant entitlement to lofty indifference to undeserved affluence.

The cliched cry of ‘pampered prima donnas’ rang out across the land. And the kid from Croxteth, whose shoulders had carried England’s highest hopes, was no longer an idol, but a target. In the words of England’s manager Fabio Capello: ‘At the moment, Rooney isn’t Rooney.’

Monday evening at Southampton, Rooney will lead out a Manchester United side who seek to impose pressure on Chelsea and Manchester City at the summit of the Premier League. Most of his colleagues have been acquired at huge expense from around the world, yet Rooney remains the soul and the spirit of his team.

He works harder, covers more ground, expends more energy and scores more goals than the rest. And he has embraced the responsibility of captaincy; pleading, scolding, encouraging team-mates by effort and example.

As with United, so with England. From time to time, there have been tentative calls for Rooney to be ‘rested’. Capello came under heavy pressure to bite the bullet and so, at times, has Roy Hodgson.

Both resisted and both were right to stand by their judgment. True, Rooney did not always appear to justify their faith. There were days when the ball would bounce off his shins, when his intensity seemed reduced and the play seemed to be happening around him.

Many of us believed his physique would eventually betray him, that his heavy body would impair both endurance and acceleration, and the subsequent frustration would truncate his career. He has taken pleasure in proving us wrong. In truth, Rooney will never be the player we dreamed he might become when Everton put him in their first team at 16 years old, or when England capped him a year later.

Those were the days when starry-eyed comparisons were made with Paul Gascoigne, another free spirit and perhaps the English game’s purest talent since Tom Finney.

Gascoigne was the pitiful victim of alcoholism and of the cynical exploitation of those who should have protected him. Rooney was never blessed with Gascoigne’s instinctive genius, but his foundations were firmer, he was fortunate in having a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson to steer him through the critical stages of his career and, in Coleen, married a woman who shares his background and appreciates his pressures.

He gave a fascinating interview on the occasion of his 100th cap, when he spoke of the problem of trying to prolong his England career into his thirties while still spending time with Coleen and his sons.

‘I actually spoke to my wife about it,’ recalled Rooney. ‘I said it’s mad how all the players are retiring. When you get to a certain age, you almost feel like you have to do it to extend your club career. She was very good. She was the one who said to me, “It’s a short career, you have plenty of time to have your time off with us as a family when you finish playing. You’ll regret it if you do.”

‘I thought, “Yes, I would. Football is what I love doing. Playing for my country I love, I’d regret it. I don’t think I would ever walk away”.’ It was the measured response of one who had given his situation some thought. And here, perhaps, we see the essential change in Rooney.

At 29, he has achieved a pleasing measure of maturity. We see it both in his play and in his answers to questions. He gives them earnest thought, considers the options and arrives at a serious conclusion.

The trite, all-purpose cliches supplied by media advisers have been jettisoned. Instead, we sense we are listening to a man who has discovered his own mind.

He will never completely abandon the old instincts. No matter how many more goals he may score or caps he may win, he will always be just a single calamitous tackle away from uproar.

But Wayne Rooney has achieved something remarkable; he has grown up, while remaining the best kid in the playground.

Those of us who recall that sad evening in Cape Town will rejoice in the transformation.

Sam Hammam, former owner of Wimbledon FC, claims a new BT Sport documentary shamefully misrepresents his old club. The film paints an ugly picture of fights, physical intimidation, bullying and loutishness. 

‘The programme portrayed the group as violent thugs, as if that was all they had to them,’ he says. 

Not having seen it, I cannot usefully comment. But I did witness some of the repellent excesses of Wimbledon’s ‘Crazy Gang’ in the 80s and 90s. And I suspect the programme makers have done a pretty accurate job.
