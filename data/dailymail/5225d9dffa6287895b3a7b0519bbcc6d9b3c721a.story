Olympic star Steve Backley is to split from his wife of 11 years after she brought divorce proceedings against him.

The javelin thrower is said to have been separated from his wife Clare 'for some time' and is reportedly dating a woman in her 20s, who he met after the split.

Clare, 38, started divorce proceedings at a London court last week and was granted a decree nisi - the first stage in a divorce - it emerged today.

Backley, 45, is best known for winning silver medals in javelin at the Atlanta 1996 and Sydney 2000 Olympics, as well as bronze at Barcelona 1992.

He married Clare - with whom he has two daughters, aged ten and eight - in October 2003 after reportedly meeting her in a pub. The couple moved to Chistlehurst, Kent, not far from where Clare runs a bridal shop.

She was by this side when he was awarded an OBE in 2003 and he later told how she helped him battle the injuries picked up during his years as a top athlete.

Speaking in 2009, he said: 'I was finding it hard to sleep because of the pain from my hip joint rubbing against the socket. I can honestly say I did not get a good night's rest for nearly five years.

'Not surprisingly I felt low at times. I was letting Clare down. After all, who wants to be married to someone who is old before their time?

'Our eldest daughter was born in 2004 and then, after her sister came along two years later, the pain in my hips and lower back was so bad I couldn't even bend down to pick her up off the floor, which was heartbreaking as a new father.'

Backley rose to fame in the 1990s, winning a string of Olympic and Commonwealth Games medals in javelin

The Sun reported this morning that Clare's petition for divorce claimed Backley's behaviour had caused her 'anxiety and distress'.

A friend told the paper his marriage had 'been over for some time' and that he is now 'moving on with his life'. 

Since retiring from sport, he has appeared on ITV's Dancing on Ice in 2008 alongside skater Susie Lipanova, and he admitted the show made him a 'sex symbol'.

Speaking at the time, he told the Daily Mirror: 'I've been sent all sorts of knickers... tiny ones, big ones and some quite tasteful stuff. But none of it fits me

'Some of the letters are quite fruity, saying 'Ooh, you're so sexy' and that kind of stuff. But then I get to the end and the women say, "PS, I'm 81".'

He said Clare - who supported him throughout the show - 'loved his outfits, especially the tight T-shirts'.
