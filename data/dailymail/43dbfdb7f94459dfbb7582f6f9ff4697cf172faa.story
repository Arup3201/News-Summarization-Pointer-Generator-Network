Bankers have been accused of acting like pigs, snakes and rats.

But scientists in California now believe they act more like teeth-baring monkeys.

The researchers claim that primate social networks could provide valuable lessons that will help predict and prevent future financial crisis.

The study at the University of California argues that captive rhesus macaque monkeys and bankers both take part in comprise complex networks.

Researchers propose that crises are sometimes caused by breakdowns in these internal networks rather than by external factors.

They argue that catastrophic collapses could be avoided by monitoring changes in these complex and often mysterious internal structures.

‘Admittedly, comparing monkeys to a financial system is unconventional, however, we believe the comparison is compelling,’ said Fushing Hsieh, a professor of statistics and the study’s lead author.

‘We argue that it’s possible to detect when a crisis is likely to set in - whether in a primate social group or an industry like banking - by modeling the evolution of the breakdowns across the system’s networks,’  said co-author Óscar Jordà.

'There may not be much teeth-baring in the banking industry, however we did determine that interbank lending would be the network in that system that is of comparable importance to subordination signalling in a monkey colony,' Professor McCowan said

A chimpanzee in Russia has been shown to outperform 94 per cent of Russia's investment funds with her portfolio growing by three times in one year.

Several years ago, Moscow TV reported how circus chimp Lusha chose eight companies from a possible 30 to invest her one million roubles - around £21,000.

The money-wise ape was given cubes representing different companies and asked: 'Lusha where would you like to invest your money this year?'

Pausing briefing to think, she then picked out her eight cubes.

Lusha's top picks included banks where shares soon rose a stunning 600 per cent after large-scale support from the Kremlin to weather the crisis. 

She missed out on telecommunications which scored a 240 per cent profit, but went for mining companies, up 150 per cent.  

The researchers first examined the power structure and significant points, or nodes, that comprise the networks in the monkey social group and applied them to comparable networks in the banking industry.

For example, the networks in a community of captive monkeys are based on behaviours such as mutual grooming, fighting, assisting in fights and displaying status signals such as teeth-baring.

In the banking industry, the primary activities revolve around interbank lending, loan syndication, bond-issuing services and insurance.

The researchers determined that the most important activities within each system are those that influence other relationships.

In monkey society, for instance, teeth-baring and other status behaviour that signal who is the boss comprise the ‘main network’ because they govern close, long-term relationships and aggression between individual monkeys.

‘There may not be much teeth-baring in the banking industry, however we did determine that interbank lending would be the network in that system that is of comparable importance to subordination signalling in a monkey colony,’ Professor McCowan said.

These main networks are critically important because they significantly influence the stability of other relationships or networks within each respective system, she said.

The researchers argue that by looking at changes in the connectivity patterns within the main network, it’s possible to measure growing disturbances within the system, detect a mounting problem.
