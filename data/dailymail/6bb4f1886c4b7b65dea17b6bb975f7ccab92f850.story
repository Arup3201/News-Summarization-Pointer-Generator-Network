Martin Crowe can 'happily live with' New Zealand's World Cup final against Australia being potentially the last match he ever watches.

Former Black Caps captain Crowe, 52, is suffering from lymphoma, a cancer of the immune system.

He made an initial recovery after being diagnosed with the disease in 2012 but wrote on Twitter last September: 'After a brilliant year of self discovery and recovery I have more work to do. My friend & tough taskmaster Lymphoma is back to teach me.'

He has since undergone chemotherapy but even as his health fails, he cannot contain his excitement about the prospect awaiting his country and its near neighbour.

Crowe wrote on ESPN Cricinfo: 'On Sunday, in front of a packed house at the one and only Melbourne Cricket Ground, Australia and New Zealand go to war once again. This time not as brothers in arms but as fierce rivals, a rivalry all the more meaningful for our long history together.

'We are brothers and will always be. On Sunday one sibling will upset the other. As one of those proud brothers, I am stunned by the prospect.

'Without question, this will be the personal cricketing highlight of my life, and I sense for New Zealand too.

'My precarious life ahead may not afford me the luxury of many more games to watch and enjoy. So this is likely to be it. The last, maybe, and I can happily live with that.'

Brendon McCullum's attacking batting and captaincy has led New Zealand to the final, while Martin Guptill rewrote the World Cup record books with his unbeaten 237 against the West Indies in the quarter-final, while the bowling attack has also been in form.

Crowe continued: 'To see the two sons I never had, Ross Taylor and Marty Guptill, run out in black, in sync with their close comrades, drawing on all their resolve and resilience, will be mesmerically satisfying.

'I will hold back tears all day long. I will gasp for air on occasions. I will feel like a nervous parent. I will, like so many Kiwis making the short trek across the Tasman, feel this to be the greatest cricketing time of our lives.

'Four million dare to believe, while 11 (and back-up) dare to achieve. Whatever happens, March 29 at the MCG will be the most divine fun ever.'
