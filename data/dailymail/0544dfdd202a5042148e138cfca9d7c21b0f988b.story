Tragic: Sydney Kustu was a former professor of biology at UC Berkeley. She killed herself Tuesday by mixing common chemicals and creating toxic gas that caused an entire San Francisco Bay area hotel and the surrounding block to be evacuated

A respected UC Berkeley sciences professor has now been identified as the woman who committed suicide in an historic San Francisco Bay Area hotel room using toxic gas on Tuesday, her 71st birthday.

The landmark Berkeley City Club was evacuated around 2pm after Sydney Kustu mixed common chemicals to produce deadly sodium azide gas, authorities said Wednesday.

Kustu, a member of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences, was discovered dead by a maid and had reportedly left notes warning of the dangerous chemical.

Colleagues said she was divorced and had a son.

The club and hotel were immediately emptied and the surrounding streets and sidewalks closed to vehicles and pedestrians.

Authorities treated it as a hazardous materials situation from the beginning thanks to Kustu's notes, the San Francisco Chronicle reports, but it took hours to ride the building of the substance.

'We treated the situation with an abundance of caution given the nature of what we were dealing with,' BPD spokesperson Officer Stephanie Polizziani said.

According to Berkeleyside, coroners will conduct an autopsy to determine the exact cause of death unless 'a risk of exposure of the chemicals to employees' is determined.

Kustu was at one time a member on the faculty of Berkeley's Plant & Microbial Biology Department, where she was recruited in 1987.

The victim reportedly left a suicide note outside her apartment alerting first responders to the hazardous situation, police said.

Other residents and guests were evacuated, but there no one else was injured.

'The known quantity of what appeared to be a hazardous material has been removed,' Sgt Okies BPD Sergeant Joe Okies said at the time.

The Julia Morgan-designed Berkeley City Club is a hotel and private social club with an indoor swimming pool and a restaurant, as well as a hair salon and meeting spaces.
