Campaigning Green group Friends of the Earth is at the centre of a row over BBC claims it has dropped its long-standing opposition to nuclear power.

Just two years ago the organisation was warning nuclear energy was ‘a gamble we don’t need to take’.

It said there was good evidence to believe the country could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by closing coal and gas fired power stations without the need to fill the resulting energy gap with nuclear.

The group also complained nuclear was too expensive and created radioactive waste that would be a danger for thousands of years.

However, the BBC reported yesterday that the group had dropped its opposition to nuclear power in a major shift in policy.

It said the group’s director of policy, Craig Bennett, believed the time it takes to build new nuclear power stations was the biggest worry, rather than safety.

Mr Bennett told the Radio 4 Today programme: ‘The biggest risk of nuclear is it takes far too long to build.’

He suggested the whole process of getting approval for new nuclear power plants was so expensive and long-winded that it was better to opt for other low carbon options, such as wind, solar and wave power.

The comments triggered an immediate row with both Mr Bennett and the FoE leadership accusing the BBC of misrepresenting the organisation’s views.

The group’s executive director, Andy Atkins, released a statement saying the group had made no changes to its stance on nuclear.

He said: ‘Friends of the Earth has not changed its position on nuclear power. We remain firmly opposed to it and continue to strongly promote a transition to an energy system based on energy efficiency and our abundant resource of renewable energy, which is getting cheaper to exploit by the day.

‘We have always been an evidence-based organisation and we commission independent reports to ensure our policy positions are robust, and we will continue to do so in the future.'

Mr Bennett said the BBC’s report had been misleading and he asked for a correction.

He said: ‘Of course there are real concerns about radiation particularly around nuclear waste and it’s right we are concerned about that.

'But it’s important the debate has shifted down the years. The real concern now is how we get on fast with decarbonising our electricity supply, if you look at the models, it shows nuclear cannot be delivered fast.’

The BBC Environment Specialist, Roger Harribin, who was behind the report, defended his piece on Twitter saying: ‘Does FoE want existing nukes closed?

'No. Is its main objection now cost not safety? Yes. You’re not pro-nuke but this is shift.’
