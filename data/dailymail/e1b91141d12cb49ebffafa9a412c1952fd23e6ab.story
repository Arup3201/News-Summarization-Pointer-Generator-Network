A father-of-four has earned himself the title of 'world's most annoying husband' after playing daily pranks and gags on his family - and uploading them to YouTube.

Stuart Valentino, 34, has been playing tricks on his wife Samantha, 34, since their very first date.

His long-suffering partner and children are often the unwitting stars of his videos, one of which sees him spend the whole weekend slapping his family with a fish and drawing a monkey face on his sleeping wife's bottom.

But despite being the butt of his jokes, Mrs Valentino insists his unusual sense of humour is 'refreshing' and she wouldn't change him at all.

His tricks have racked up 300,000 You Tube views since he started sharing them after he got married in 2013. 

The mother-of-four said: 'He's just awful, he just doesn't know when to stop. It's got to the point now that we are used to it, there is never a quiet time.

'Everyone gets it, my friends and family are targets the second they walk through. He's just constantly going.

'It's silly things, like I'll be getting something out of the boot of the car and he'll just come along and knock me into the back of it.

'People always tell me he must be the most annoying husband in the world and people think I'm crazy for still being with him, but at the end of the day they all like him and they think he's really funny - so I think that sums it up really.

'If other people lived in my house they would definitely sleep with one eye open. As it is I do my best to stay up as late as I can.

'I'll often try and wait up for him but he stays up so late waiting for me to go to sleep, you just know that he is planning something.

'I'd say it would be a hard push to find anyone else that would be prepared to put with how irritating he can be.'

His tricks - including wiping his sleeping children with shaving cream - have racked up 300,000 You Tube views since he started sharing them after he got married in 2013

The pair met at a nightclub six years ago and he played his first prank within a few days. 

She recalled that he pretended to eat cat excrement -  fake - which made her instantly vomit.

In spite of his bizarre pranks they tied the knot in May 2013.

Now the van driver from Southsea, near Portsmouth, regularly torments Samantha's children from a previous relationship - Callum, 16, Luke, 12, and Lana, 11 - as well as their daughter Ayla, two. 

Mrs Valentino, a cleaner, said: 'He was quite silly from the moment I met him really, but he's very lovely and to be honest I found it quite entertaining and refreshing.

'He hasn't annoyed me so much I feel the need to leave him just yet. I could see it. If I was having a really bad day I can see him being served with divorce papers.'

Mr Valentino appreciates his wife must be one of the most understanding in the world - but has no intention of stopping his daily gags. 

'At the end of the day it's all just entertainment - in our house it's like a real life Tom and Jerry,' he said.

'Everyone, extended family and friends, knows exactly what they are in for the second they walk through our front door.

'Even her parents know to expect it now. They came around for Christmas a couple of years ago and her step dad was stood on the door step.

'I just tugged his trousers and they fell straight down but he'd forgotten to put pants on that morning so he was just stood on the doorstep waving completely naked.

'People tell me I am the most annoying husband all the time. They say that they would have killed me by now if they were with me.

'Everyone always says she deserves a medal for putting up with me all the time.

'A lot of people on Youtube have commented on the videos saying they can't believe she is still with me.

'At the end of the day she's always smiling - there's never a dull moment in the house.'
