Five teenagers were rushed to hospital from an alcohol fueled party thrown by a teenage girl - while her father claimed he slept through it all.

Two of the teens are said to be in a critical condition with reports they had mixed alcohol with the anti-anxiety drug Xanax.

Neighbors saw the teens being wheeled away on gurneys into waiting ambulances while dozens of others teens fled when police arrived.

Drunk: Even the teenage girl who organized the party ended up boozing so much that she had to be taken to hospital by ambulance

Slept like a baby: Steve Miller's daughter was one of five teenagers to be rushed to hospital after the drink and drug-fueled party but he apparently didn't hear a thing

Rammed: More than 100 people shoved their way inside the house in Winter Park, Florida, near Orlando

Steve Miller, whose teen daughter hosted the party and was among those rushed to hospital, told local TV he was asleep while as many as 100 people crammed into his home.

Miller, a father of six, claimed he had no idea there would be alcohol at the party - but did not say if he had checked.

He insisted he slept through all the noise as 100 teens flocked to his home in Winter Garden, Florida.

'If my daughter told me they were going to have alcohol I wouldn't have permitted it,'Miller said.

'I didn't see any drugs.'

Hospitalized: Five teenagers were taken to hospital suffering from the after-effects of drink and drugs

Unwanted attention: As soon as the cops showed up, most of the guests ran off

Denial: Steve Miller whose home the party was held at says he never saw any alcohol and would have known about it if there was (even though he claims to have been asleep)

Police said the teenagers taken to hospital had passed out from drink but fear they may have also taken drugs.

'We found five teenagers who appeared to have overdosed on alcohol and we are not sure of what type of drug right now,'said Lt. Paul Hopkins from the Orange County Sheriff's Office.

Investigators said they spotted numerous underage kids partying at the home.

They said one was unconscious and five were sickened, apparently from drinking too much alcohol.

The victims were boys and girls between the ages of 15 and 17. 

Neighbors were stunned by the scenes in their road on Friday night and said they were kept awake by the noise.

'I've
 been living here 30 years, and I've never really seen anything going on
 over there. It just surprises me. I'm like, 'Wow.' Hopefully, the kids 
are going to be OK,' a neighbor said.

Deputies
 said the conditions of the teens had improved over the weekend and they
 said the parents apparently didn't know someone had brought alcohol 
into the home.

Doreen Blume said Miller's daughter was one of the hospitalized teens.

Blume said Miller did the right thing.

'He confiscated all kinds of alcohol, big bottles,' Blume said.

Other neighbors said deputies have been to the home before.

The Department of Children and Families has launched an investigation because of concerns about alcohol and supervision.

Unwanted company: No sooner had the cops arrived, the party suddenly ended leaving the father, Steve Miller, to do a lot of explaining
