Mercenaries from Britain or America are being deployed by the Ukrainian government in an operation to wipe out  pro-Moscow fighters in the country’s lawless eastern regions, it has been alleged.

‘We hear English speech on the airwaves,’ claimed Alexander Borodai, prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic.
