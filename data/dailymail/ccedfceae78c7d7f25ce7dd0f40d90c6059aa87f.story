Christopher Stott is completely dependent on his wife Nicola, but was treated 'disgracefully' by Thomas Cook when staff refused to let the couple sit together

A severely disabled passenger treated ‘disgracefully’ by an airline cannot sue for compensation because of a shocking legal loophole, senior judges said yesterday.

Thomas Cook staff left Christopher Stott ‘humiliated’ by refusing to let him sit with his wife Nicola on a plane, even though he needs constant attention and the couple had paid extra to do so.

But Supreme Court judges said the holiday firm had done nothing wrong in law, because airlines are governed by an international convention which says nothing about mistreatment of the disabled.

Cabin crew left Mrs Stott kneeling in the aircraft aisle trying to look after her husband throughout a flight that lasted more than three hours.

The airline failed to find a way for the couple to sit together even though they had paid a fee to do so, and despite assuring them twice that they would get the seats they needed.

Staff failed to ask other passengers if they would agree to move to accommodate Mr and Mrs Stott.Cabin crew did not help even when Mr Stott’s wheelchair overturned and he fell to the floor of the aircraft.

If the couple had been treated the same way on the ground, the firm concerned would have faced criminal prosecution under disability discrimination laws as well as the prospect of a compensation bill.

But Thomas Cook will face no sanctions and does not need to pay even token compensation, the judges said, because airline flights and the embarkation of passengers are governed by the Montreal Convention.

Mr Stott, 58, a former pensions administrator, said: ‘The convention that covers airlines was last rewritten in the 1990s and it didn’t make any allowance for disability.’  The judges called for the agreement to be revised urgently to plug the loophole.

The couple, from Tarporley in Cheshire, went on holiday to the island of Zante in Greece in 2008 and paid a £30 premium to sit together

Mr Stott, who has been paralysed from the shoulders down since a cycling accident at the age of 21, relies entirely on his wife for such basics as movement and feeding, the court heard.

The couple, from Tarporley in Cheshire, went on holiday to the island of Zante in Greece in 2008. They paid a £30 premium to sit together and were told they would be allocated the proper seats.

However, when they checked in for the return flight they were told they could not sit together, and seat allocations could not be changed.

Their case was brought to court by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.

Lord Toulson, who was sitting with four other Supreme Court judges, said: ‘When boarding the aircraft from an ambulift, matters got much worse.

‘As he entered the aircraft, Mr Stott’s wheelchair overturned and he fell to the cabin floor.

‘Those present appeared not to know how to deal with the situation. Mr Stott felt extremely embarrassed, humiliated and angry.’

Lord Toulson said ‘cabin crew apparently made no attempt to ease their difficulties’, adding ‘it was a very unhappy experience’.

The airline’s behaviour would break British and European discrimination law, the judges said.Lord Toulson said: ‘There is much to be said for the argument that it is time for the Montreal Convention to be amended.’

Supreme Court deputy president Lady Hale said the couple had been treated ‘disgracefully’ by Thomas Cook, and it was equally disgraceful that the law gave them no redress.

A spokesman for Thomas Cook Airlines said, “We make every effort to ensure that any customer requesting assistance receives the help they need. Whilst we welcome the unanimous decision of the Supreme Court today, we’d like to reiterate our apology to Mr and Mrs Stott following their requests not being met when they travelled with us in 2008.”
