Upset: Aditya Mukerjee, pictured, who is of Indian origin but lives and works in New York, was traveling to LA to meet his family when he was refused to board

A New York-based Hindu man was barred by JetBlue from boarding a Los Angeles-bound flight recently, even after TSA cleared him to fly.

Aditya Mukerjee, who is of Indian origin but lives and works in New York, was traveling to LA to meet his family for an annual pilgrimage that involves a week 'visiting temples, praying' and spending time with friends and relatives.

But he ended up being detained for four hours at JFK, according to a blog post that has since gone viral, and was questioned by TSA, NYPD, FBI and Homeland Security before JetBlue refused to let him board the plane.

The ordeal began when Mukerjee, a data scientist who has worked at NYU, declined to go through the airport's milimeter wave detector, something he regularly does as a frequent flyer, and opted for a routine pat down instead.

During the procedure, Mukerjee's hands were swabbed with a 'cotton-like material' used to check for explosive residue.

For some reason, he thinks it may have been anti-bedbug spray he had used the previous day while moving house, Mukerjee's sample set off the machine, sparking a frightening series of events for the young man.

In his extensive blog post entitled 'Don't Fly During Ramadan,' he explains how he was quizzed extensively about his vacation, and the interrogation intensified once he revealed he and his family would be 'visiting some temples.'

The week he was traveling just happened to be the last week of Ramadan, which he believes may have had the authorities and the airline on particular edge as he thinks they thought he was Muslim.

He describes how he was detained for hours without food or water and interrogated by nearly every federal law enforcement agency.

'You'll have to understand, when a person of your... background walks into here, traveling alone, and sets off our alarms, people start to get a bit nervous,' one FBI agent told him, he writes. 'I'm sure you've been following what's been going on in the news recently. You've got people from five different branches of government all in here - we don't do this just for fun.'

JetBlue: 'We regret the embarrassment and inconvenience this caused our customer but stand by our crewmember's decision,' JetBlue said in a tweet

But he said the thing that upset him the most was how JetBlue treated him, after he had been cleared by authorities to fly.

He explained that after the fourth time he was patted down, a female TSA agent asked for his baggage claim ticket.

'I handed it to her, and she told me that a woman from JetBlue corporate security needed to ask me some questions as well. I was a bit surprised, but agreed.' He said the JetBlue representative walked in and introduced herself by name before asking him whether he had flown JetBlue before.

'Yes,' he said. She relied 'How often?' and he said about 10 times.

She paused, then asked, 'Will you have any trouble following the instructions of the crew and flight attendants on board the flight?'

Shocked as to why this would be in doubt, he replied 'No.'

'We have some female flight attendants. Would you be able to follow their instructions?' she went on to say.

Mukerjee wrote in the blog: 'I was almost insulted by the question, but I answered calmly, "Yes, I can do that."'

Viral: The passenger's blog post has gone viral since the event and prompted a firestorm on JetBlue's Twitter account

'Okay,' she continued, 'and will you need any special treatment during your flight? Do you need a special place to pray on board the aircraft?'

He wrote: 'Only here did it hit me,' referring to the fact the woman seemed to think he was Muslim.

He said he responded 'No,' with a light-hearted chuckle, 'trying to conceal any sign of how offensive her questions were' and then thanked her anyway.

'She left the room, again, leaving me alone for another ten minutes or so. When she finally returned, she told me that I had passed the TSA's inspection. "However, based on the responses you've given to questions, we're not going to permit you to fly today."'

Mukerjee stood in disbelief. The TSA and the NYPD had cleared him to board the plane, 'but JetBlue had decided to ground me,' he wrote.

JetBlue agreed to refund his ticket, but wouldn't allow him to fly that day, forcing him to purchase a ticket with another airline that cost him an additional $700.

Mukerjee's post went viral on Thursday, prompting a barrage of angry tweets to JetBlue's Twitter account.

'We don't control security screening,' JetBlue's account handler told one critic demanding an explanation.

'We regret the embarrassment and inconvenience this caused our customer but stand by our crewmember's decision,' the carrier told person.

A third tweet blamed Mukerjee's 'disposition at the time' for the decision to ban him from boarding.

A JetBlue spokesperson told MailOnline on Friday: 'We stand by our decision.'
