Scores of shoppers were today left fearing they would not get their presents in time for Christmas Day after accusing one of the UK's biggest courier firms of losing orders and delaying deliveries.

Customers have gone online to voice their anger after experiencing a spate of problems with City Link, with some saying they will not now be able to give their gifts to loved ones tomorrow.

City Link describes 
itself as a 'market leading service provider of guaranteed Next Day & Timed delivery services' but has admitted receiving 'unprecedented levels' of orders over the festive period.

Established in 1969, it now operates over 2,500 vehicles and has an annual turnover of more than £300million.

On its website, the firm boasts that it provides 'high quality, flexible and innovative service solutions across the UK, Ireland and Worldwide'.

Among the disgruntled clients was comedian and author Charlie Higson 
who says his son will not be getting one of his presents after claiming 
it was 'lost' by the firm.

One customer claims that an armchair for her 85-year-old father won't now arrive until December 28 when it should have been delivered 10 ten days earlier.

Another said they will have to buy a replacement present for their mother and plans to send the bill to City Link.

Meanwhile, one Twitter user claims he spent 25 minutes on an 0844 number trying to chase their delayed parcel without success.

Another said their new camera was left on the doorstep for three hours despite claiming they had not signed for it.

City
Link said it was working around the clock to ensure it stuck to its 
'Christmas promise' to have every order delivered by today.

A spokeswoman later said all parcels that had left the depots today had been delivered by 5.30pm.

Mr Higson, who made his name on the 
Fast Show, tweeted: 'Can't wait to see my boy's face at Xmas when he 
unwraps his gift only to find a card from @CityLink saying We lost your 
present, get over it.'

Joanne Taylor claims she has suffered a similar experience, tweeting: 'The award for absoultely worst business in the UK goes to @CityLink. Thank you for losing an important Xmas present.'

David Lloyd, a wildlife photographer from Ealing, west London, said he 
ordered computer equipment from Amazon - one of City Link's major contractors - using its Prime service, which 
guarantees next-day delivery.

Hanging on the line: One customer posted this picture (left) of his phone home screen which they claim shows the time they waited on the phone to City Link's customer services department, while the company (right) has been fielding complaints and trying to reassure customers on its own Twitter feed

But this morning he said he was still waiting for his packages to arrive.

He told 
MailOnline: 'City Link have failed to deliver on Friday, Saturday, 
Sunday, and so far today despite GUARANTEED delivery for Friday.

'I cannot be expected to remain indoors for a delivery for four days running up to Christmas.

'Not only have I paid for a premium delivery service, I have also paid at least £25 to CityLink to their help desk.

'They have not helped and their 
promised delivery for Saturday did not eventuate. The help desk said 
they would check on my parcel but did not.'

He claimed the tracking number he was 
given told him his item had been successfully delivered to an address in
Suffolk, not his London one, eleven days prior to ordering it.

He added: 'It is now impossible to get through to their switchboard yesterday or today.'

A message posted on the company's Twitter feed last week said it had experienced 'unprecedented levels of volume, way in excess of forecasts.'

But it said it will 'endeavour' to keep to its Christmas promise to have all orders delivered by the end of today.

A spokeswoman for City Link told MailOnline today: 'All the depot floors were clear this morning so all items are out for delivery today.'

Later, at 5.30pm, she said 'everything' had been delivered.

She was not able to say how many people had been affected by delayed deliveries.

A spokesman for Amazon said: 'We work with a variety of carriers to deliver the many millions of orders that we dispatch on a weekly basis.

'Amazon measures itself on its ability to deliver items by the estimated delivery date we provide customers and the delivery performance is very strong.

'We take all customer feedback on board, actively monitor the performance of our carriers and make improvements in order that we can provide an even better service in the future.'
