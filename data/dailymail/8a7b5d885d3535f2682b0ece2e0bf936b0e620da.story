A Democratic congressman who is running to be the next governor of Maine wrote an op-ed announcing that he is gay.

Congressman Mike Michaud wrote that his competitors have started spreading 'whisper campaigns, insinuations and push-polls' that raised questions about his personal life, so he decided to announce it himself.

'They want people to question whether I am gay. Allow me to save them the trouble with a simple, honest answer: “Yes, I am. But why should it matter?”' he wrote.

Coming out: Congressman Mike Michaud, 58, announced that he is gay in an op ed that he wrote for two local newspapers and a national wire service

The six-term Congressman made the announcement in an op-ed provided to The Associated Press and two Maine newspapers. 

Michaud, 58, wrote that he wanted his political foes to know that, in his word, 'I am not ashamed of who I am.'

He acknowledged that it 'may seem like a big announcement to some people. For me, it’s just a part of who I am, as much as being a third-generation millworker or a lifelong Mainer.'

'Growing up in a large Franco-American Catholic family, it’s never been in my nature to talk about myself. I write this now merely to let my opponents and the outside interests who fund them know that I am not ashamed of who I am,' he wrote. 

Moving on up: Michaud is leading in the polls to oust the sitting Republican governor of Maine. If he wins, he will become the first openly homosexual person elected as a governor in the United States

Competitors: Republican governor Paul LePage (left) and Independent challenger Eliot Cutler (right) are also vying for the state house

Michaud didn't identify who he thinks was behind the whisper campaign.

The announcement adds intrigue to a tight three-way race with LePage, the Republican incumbent, and wealthy independent Eliot Cutler.

It's unknown what impact, if any, Michaud's disclosure might have in a state where voters approved gay marriage a year ago. Michaud supported the measure.

There are no gay governors in the United States which would make his victory a landmark one.
