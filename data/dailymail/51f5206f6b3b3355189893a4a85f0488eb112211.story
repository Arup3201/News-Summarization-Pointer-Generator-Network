A convicted murderer who tortured a man to death in a row over a bag of chips has been sentenced to life in a woman's prison after arranging to have a sex change on the NHS.

Paris Green - who was born Peter Laing - was one of three men who brutally attacked Robert Shankland - then munched on ham sandwiches as their victim lay dying.

But Green will now serve her life sentence in Cornton Vale prison for women after Glasgow's High Court was told she is to receive what was described as 'gender realignment surgery' in England.

Surgery: Paris Green - who was born Peter Laing - will serve a life sentence for murder at a women's prison after arranging to have a sex change operation at the taxpayer's expense

A jury heard how Green, 22, Kevin McDonagh, 23, and Dean Smith, 20, lured their victim to Green's flat in Glenrothes, Fife in March this year.

Mr Shankland was tied up with torn bedding, battered, kicked and attacked with a rolling pin after a row over a bag of chips.

A ligature was also tied around his neck and a plastic bag pulled over his head.

Mr Shankland - who suffered from a heart disease - was killed either by suffocation or blunt force injuries.

The killers then scoffed ham sandwiches which had been paid for after selling their victim's mobile phone.

Victim: Robert Shankland, 45, was brutally tortured to death following a row which allegedly began over a bag of crisps

Judge John Morris QC locked each of them up at the High Court in Glasgow for a minimum 18 years.

He told the trio: 'This was a particularly gruesome murder which effectively involved the torture of your victim over many hours.

'It beggars belief that you could act towards another human being in this way.'

The judge added: 'Your conduct was utterly depraved. You left Mr Shankland - even in death - without any dignity whatsoever.'

Green's friend Maggie Shields told the trial that she visited the flat and learned about the death - before recalling how the trio boasted about the beating.

The 31 year-old explained: 'Dean jumped up quite excitedly and said: "I will show you the body". I still did not think that they had killed him.'

Miss Shields went on to say the violence had erupted after a row about buying a bag of chips.

But, the three killers concocted a story claiming Mr Shankland had made sexual advances to each of them in turn.

The witness said she fled the flat terrified and contacted the police.

McDonagh later told officers who arrested him: 'He tried to fight back. After that it was just disgusting.'

The jury heard how McDonagh sent his mum a 'farewell' text that night.

He also posted messages on Facebook to say he had 'f***** up his life' and had 'gone too far'.

The court heard the victim had no record of any sexual convictions at all and his family were distraught at claims he was involved in such behaviour.

Guilty: Kevin McDonagh, left, and Dean Smith, right,Â  helped lure Mr Shankland to Green's flat in Glenrothe's where they tortured him to death

Green's lawyer Ian Bryce said she had a 'troubled background' affected by issues with 'gender identity'.

Mr Bryce added: 'This conviction might set back any gender realignment surgery as that has to be carried out in England.'

Green's surgery is expected to cost several thousand of pounds and will include travel and accommodation expenses as well as guards.

Inmates and staff at Cornton Vale are reportedly furious at having to deal with him.

Scottish Tories chief whip John Lamont told the Daily Record: 'Upon killing this man, he should have lost all his rights to a sex change on the NHS.

'This sums up just how crazy our justice system has become.'
