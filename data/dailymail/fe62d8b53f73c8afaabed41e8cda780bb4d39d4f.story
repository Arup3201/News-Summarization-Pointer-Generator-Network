Vegans and those suffering from lactose intolerance could soon be eating 'cheese' grown in a lab, made using yeast, vegetable butter and water.

Biohackers in California have found a way to create cheese protein genes based on sequences in cow DNA, before growing them in baker’s yeast and using them to create a ‘milk’ substitute.

This milk can then be churned using traditional cheese-making methods to become real vegan cheese.

Real vegan cheese is the brainchild of biohackers from Counter Culture Labs and BioCurious in California (pictured). They create cheese protein genes based on sequences in cow DNA, before growing them in baker's yeast and using them to create a 'milk'. This can then be churned using traditional cheese-making methods

‘We live in an unsustainable world. The cheese we eat today is produced by commercial dairy cows which, though they produce delicious milk and cheese, have an exceptionally large carbon footprint,’ explained the biohackers from Counter Culture Labs and BioCurious.

The process begins by taking genetic sequences inspired by cow DNA, and creating cheese protein genes that function in yeast.

To create the proteins, the researchers studied animal genomes to find natural milk-protein genetic sequences.

They optimised the genes for use in yeast, and created the resulting yeast milk protein DNA from scratch.

This
 DNA is then put into yeast cells where the cells take over and produce
 real milk-protein.

The
 genetically modified yeast creates cheese protein as it grows.

The raw 
cheese protein is extracted and separated from the yeast.

To
 make real vegan cheese, the researchers then take the cheese protein 
and combine it with the three other main cheese ingredients, including, 
fat, or in this case vegetable butter, vegan sugar in place of 
lactose, and water.

Mixing these creates the vegan milk, which can then be then turned into cheese.

‘By creating an alternative pathway to cheese, we help the environment, increase access to tasty and healthy food.

Although the genes are inspired by the genetic sequencing of mammals, they are actually made from scratch.

Start-up company Muufri is planning to produce a cow-free milk.

The team, from University College Cork, Ireland, said the product is not only artificial, but also free of lactose and cholesterol.

Manufacturing process is set to begin this year, and the final product should be ready by July 2015.

Ultimately the team hopes to bring their artificial milk to mark in three years.

This means none of the genes have ever been part of an animal, making them truly vegan. 

‘We believe that using animals as large-scale food production machines is ethically and environmentally irresponsible.’

‘[But] all humans, vegans included, should have access to delicious and healthy cheese.

‘As with all scientific research, we can’t be completely certain this will work until we try it.

'But we’re confident we will be able to make vegan cheese protein and turn it into the world’s first real vegan cheese.’

They also claim the cheese would be healthier.

For
 example, for each of the four main proteins found in cheese, there are 
genetic variants found in humans and in different breeds of cows.

Although the genes are inspired by the genetic sequencing of mammals, they are actually made from scratch (pictured left). The biohackers have already raised more than $15,605 (£9,100) on Indiegogo and the next step is to turn the milk into cheese. Protein purification system is pictured right

Researchers claim the vegan cheese would be healthier. For each of the four main proteins found in cheese (stock image pictured) there are genetic variants. Some increase the risks of allergic response. As a result, the biohackers claim they can select the most desirable variants of these naturally occurring proteins

Some of these versions of the proteins are associated with various health benefits, or increased risks of allergic response.

As a result, the researchers claim they can pick and choose the most desirable variants of these naturally occurring proteins, increasing health benefits and removing allergens.

The biohackers have already raised more than $15,605 (£9,100) on Indiegogo and the next step is to turn the milk into cheese.
