Legal history was made today when a Broadmoor Hospital patient had his appeal against being locked up heard in public.

The mental health tribunal for Albert Haines, 52, who has been diagnosed with a personality disorder, offered a rare glimpse into the usually hidden world of the famous high-security psychiatric institution.

Members of the press were given full access to the proceedings, which despite the sensitive mental health issues being discussed, were reportable for the first time.

Mr Haines also attended the 
landmark hearing in a basement room of Field House in Chancery Lane, 
central London, becoming the first psychiatric patient to seek his 
freedom under the gaze of the public eye.

After being held in secure hospitals 
for 25 years following a conviction for two counts of attempted wounding
in September 1986, he successfully argued that his case should be 
considered at an open hearing after saying he wanted to expose alleged 
failings in the system.

The tribunal panel was told he did not
think there was anything wrong with him and believed his discharge was 
'in the moral public interest'.

Aswini Weereratne, representing Mr Haines, pointed out that he had not killed anybody and argued that 'to spend 25 years as a result of these incidents seems disproportionate'.

She also suggested her client had not been properly treated for the post-traumatic stress disorder he was said to have suffered in the wake of his difficult childhood.

The three-man panel heard he had a 'sense he is a victim of the system' and that he 'desperately doesn't want to be (in custody) and is angry at being there'.

This anger could account for some of his behaviour within the hospital, his lawyer told the hearing.

But Dr Jose Romero-Urcelay, Mr 
Haines's responsible clinician, argued that the patient remained a risk 
to the public and to himself.

He said: 'Mr Haines would struggle to live independently' adding 'I think it would be inevitable there would be an incident of violence.'

And he told Ms Weereratne there were 
other patients who had been detained at Broadmoor for similar or even 
lesser offences than Mr Haines's.

He told the panel Mr Haines had 
suffered deprivation and neglect during childhood and had later reported
being abused and using cannabis, cocaine and amphetamines.

The patient now believed he was being 
persecuted and had sought the public hearing in part because he feared 
mental health hearings were not impartial, the doctor said.

'I believe he suffers from paranoid 
psychosis,' he said, adding that Mr Haines had a 'constant preoccupation
with a conspiracy he feels he is the victim of'.

Outlining the patient's behaviour, he 
described him as abusive and threatening towards staff at Broadmoor and 
argued that 'the evidence is that Mr Haines would not be able to cope 
with a normal environment'.

Mr Haines, however, could be released in about two years' time if he complied with his treatment, the doctor estimated.

Not all the doctors who have seen Mr 
Haines share that opinion about his condition however, with another 
medic reporting that he showed no current psychotic symptoms, the 
tribunal heard.

Vikram Sachdeva, counsel for 
Broadmoor, asked: 'Why would Mr Haines have confidence if the doctors 
are all thinking different things?'

But Dr Romero-Urcelay said: 'We are 
not a precise science. We don't have a blood test or an X-ray that would
give you a diagnosis.'

He added: 'I would never be in a position to make any Machiavellian decisions. It would have to be done with a second opinion.'

An estimated 100,000 mental health 
tribunals have been held in the past seven years, but of these there 
were only 10 applications for the hearing to be held in public.

Only one previous application for an open session was granted, and this was later withdrawn.

Broadmoor, in Crowthorne, Berkshire, 
is home to some of Britain's most dangerous criminals, including 
Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe and serial killer Robert Napper.
