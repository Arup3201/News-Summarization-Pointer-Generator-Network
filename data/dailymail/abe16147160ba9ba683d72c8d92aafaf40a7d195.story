Anton Ferdinand has denied reports he has signed for Thai Premier League side Police United.

The former West Ham, Sunderland and Queens Park Rangers defender signed a three-year contract with Turkish side Antalyaspor last August.

But he only went on to make three appearances for them as they were relegated from the Turkish Super Lig.

Ferdinand tweeted earlier in the day that he had not agreed a deal with anyone and hinted that he could be set to return to England.

He said: 'For the record I haven't signed for anybody, still have a lot of options to explore. Watch this space.... Passport at the ready!

'Or maybe I won't need my passport!'

Police United play in the Thai Premier League which runs through the summer. They are currently 13th in the 20-team division.
