It may not look like a big catch, but this tiny fish has broken the record for being the largest tiddler ever caught in British waters.

The huge stickleback was hooked by keen angler Craig Birchall, 25, who is celebrating after breaking the record – which he set himself last year.

Mr Birchall, a warehouse worker from Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, caught the three-spined stickleback - which weighs the same as a £2 coin - in a lake near his home using a tiny piece of worm as bait and the smallest hook he could get his hands on.

Big catch: Craig Birchall, 25, is celebrating after breaking the record for catching the biggest tiddler in Britain for the second year running which he caught using a worm as bait

The stickleback fish weighed in at a 12 grams, or just under half an ounce, and measured 2.9 inches in length, breaking the British record set by Mr Birchall in 2013

He had been fishing for about an hour and reeled in hundreds of miniscule fish before he pulled up the record-breaking specimen.

Weighing in at 12 grams, or just under half an ounce, and measuring 2.9 inches in length, the fish smashes the record Mr Birchall set in April 2013.

The specimen is three grams heavier than one he caught last year, which was heavy enough to set an official record at 8.8 grams but was never verified.

The previous record for a three-spined stickleback was set in 1998 by Dennis Flack in Cambridgeshire.

Mr Birchall said he had set out to catch a three-spined stickleback - Gasterosteus aculeatus in Latin - because he feels some of the smaller species are overlooked by anglers.

He said: ‘There is a lake in a wooded area near where I live so I went down there to spend an hour or so fishing.

‘Not many people fish for the small species and I think they are underrated, so I decided that I would try and go for them.

‘I set up a small float and a really small, size 26 hook, and I used a tiny piece of worm as bait.

‘During the session time I caught about 100 stickleback which were all pretty small, but then I saw the float go under.

‘I knew it was going to be bigger than the rest but when I pulled it up I couldn't believe it.

‘I put it on some kitchen scales and it weighed six drams, which is 12 grams. It was also over two inches in length.

‘Last year I broke the British record with a five dram fish so I was really excited because this one was even bigger than that.’

Mr
 Birchall’s latest catch was witnessed by his mother Catherine, who took
 a photograph of the fish next to his hands for scale before he threw it
 back into the water alive and well.

The three-spined stickleback is the most widespread fish found in UK waters

He
 is now planning to submit the whopper - almost twice the seven-gram 
official record set in 1998 - to the British Record Fish Committee for 
verification.

Mike
 Heylin, chairman of the British Record Fish Committee, said: ‘The 
biggest stickleback we have on record was caught in 1998 by Denis Flack.

‘The one caught by Craig is huge, it's massive for the species. I would even say it’s the biggest, smallest fish.’
