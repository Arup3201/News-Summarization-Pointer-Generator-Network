Young women are obsessed with being ‘hot’, the actress Jacqueline Bisset has claimed.

They show themselves off in such an ‘obvious way’ that men feel like they are ‘in a sweet shop’, she said.

The star, 70, said a more low key approach to dress and behaviour leads to stronger relationships.

Young women are obsessed with being ‘hot’, the actress Jacqueline Bisset has claimed

The Golden Globe winner, whose career has spanned 50 years, told the Telegraph: ‘It’s brutal out there now.

‘Girls today are so attractive and sexy, and they show themselves off in such an obvious way, so men feel that they are in a sweet shop. The flip side is that women see themselves as interchangeable. I feel that this obsession to be “hot” is more prevalent than it ever was in my youth.

‘It’s not, “I want to be charming and magical and romantic and beautiful”. ‘It’s “I want to be hot”'.

Miss Bisset has never married but has had a number of long-term relationships 

The actress was born in Surrey and grew up in Reading, before moving to Hollywood in her 20s where she went on to star in films including The Deep.

She has never married but has had a number of long-term relationships. Miss Bisset attributed the change in women’s behaviour to ‘desperation’ but warned that they often end up feeling used as a result.

‘I went through a period like that, when I dressed and behaved in a certain way,’ she added. ‘I couldn’t handle the results: it didn’t get me where I wanted to be.

‘So I started to be more low key and I got better relationships as a consequence.’ Miss Bisset also revealed that she has never ‘fully embraced’ feminism and enjoyed ‘taking care’ of men. But ageing has made her feel ‘invisible’, she said.
