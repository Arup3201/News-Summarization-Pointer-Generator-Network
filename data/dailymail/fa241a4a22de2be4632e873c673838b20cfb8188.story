Donna Galliott was forced to wait outside Winchester's St Clements surgery because poorly toddler Lily was crying 'too loudly'

A young mother was forced to leave a doctor's waiting room after staff claimed her sickly toddler was crying 'too loudly'.

Donna Galliott, 26, and her poorly 16-month-old daughter, Lily, were ordered to wait by a busy road outside the surgery after booking an emergency appointment.

Miss Galliott said she burst into tears as she and distressed Lily left the practice on a receptionist's instructions.

Miss Galliott, a school cleaner and self-employed hairdresser, said: 'I felt so humiliated, it was awful.

'We were thrown out of the waiting room - the receptionist said ‘You're making too much noise'. I couldn't believe it and asked if she was joking, but she said ‘no'.'

The worried mother-of-one had phoned the surgery after spotting blistering on the roof of Lily's mouth and was told to bring her 'straight in'.

But after the mother and daughter were forced to wait more than 20 minutes past their time slot, Lily started crying and staff told them to leave the premises because they were making too much noise.

Miss Galliott, who lives in Winchester, Hampshire with her partner Daryl Brimfield, said she was humiliated by the incident at the city's St Clements Surgery.

She said: 'Lily had been unwell with a temperature for days and, when I noticed blistering on the roof of her mouth, I rang the surgery.

'They gave me an emergency appointment and I was told to bring her straight in. After a good 20 minute wait past the time slot, Lily got distressed and started screaming and we were told to wait outside.

Miss Galliott says her and her daughter's 'humiliating' treatment by surgery staff left her in tears

'I could feel myself welling up. It was absolutely humiliating, so I just picked Lily up and walked outside and burst into tears.

'When they'd told me to take her down for an emergency appointment I thought we would be rushed straight in, especially given a child is involved.'

As they stood outside in rush-hour traffic at 5.30pm, Miss Galliott decided she was too embarrassed to go back in and cancelled her appointment. They had originally been booked in to be seen at 5.10pm.

She later took Lily to be seen by Winchester hospital's out-of-hours team instead, where medics discovered she was suffering from a viral infection.

Miss Galliott added: 'Being told to leave was so utterly humiliating I just could not face going back into the surgery afterwards.

'If that's the surgery's policy, the situation needs to be dealt with. Waiting outside with a sick child is not an option - it's not fair on parents or children.

The manager of St Clements Surgery in Winchester has since apologised for Miss Galliott's treatment

'If the practice feel that strongly about noise, they need to consider having a child only waiting room.

'It's virtually impossible to tell a 16-month-old to sit down and be quiet, they're too young to understand.

Another patient, who was shocked as the mother and child were ejected from the GP's practice, branded the move ‘disgraceful'.

Julie Hicks said: 'I couldn't believe what was happening and really felt for them. There were only two other people in the waiting room who didn't seem bothered by having Lily there.

'Anyone with small kids understands they scream when they're ill - it's just the way it is. It was disgraceful and really out of order.'

St Clements practice manager Kathy Bracher today apologised and said improvements would be made following the incident.

Not wanting to stand outside with a sick child, Miss Galliott took Lily to Winchester Hospital, where the toddler was diagnosed with a viral infection

In a statement today, she said: 'St Clements practice prides itself on being a family-oriented practice where patients of all ages are welcome.

'We have to consider the needs of all our patients in our waiting rooms - some of whom may be very ill or frail - and endeavour to maintain a calm and safe environment.

'We may, rarely, have to intervene when a small child is running around the corridor and waiting room.

'Nevertheless, both the receptionist and the practice are very upset and sorry that this incident has caused distress to one of our patients.

'I personally apologised by telephone when Ms Galliott rang that evening and, again, to her partner the following day.

'It is never our intention to upset or cause embarrassment to any of our patients. We have discussed, as a practice, the way this incident was handled and agreed improved ways of dealing with similar situations in the future.'
