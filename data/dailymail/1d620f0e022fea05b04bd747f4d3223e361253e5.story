After days of glorious sunshine, Britain is set to be hit by a wave of wintry weather - with temperatures halving across much of the UK and even dropping to as low as -11C in some parts.

Forecasters predict that this weekend will be less settled than recent days, with rain likely to affect most areas and temperatures dropping to 13C in London.

Met Office spokesman Charles Powell said: 'By Saturday the temperatures will be down to 12C and 13C. We will still
get some bright weather but we will lose the wall-to-wall sunshine we 
have enjoyed.

Forecasters Netweather suggest that temperatures in the Scottish Highlands will dip to as low as -11C by Wednesday with widespread freezing temperatures across much of the UK

Downpours are likely in the north and snow is expected over the Scottish Highlands with up to six inches of snow possible on high ground. The wintry weather will then spread south during the week.

And temperatures are likely to plummet to an average of 45F by Wednesday - in stark contrast to this week's high of 73F.

Weather experts say the dip in 
temperatures is caused by a change in wind patterns, with Arctic blasts 
replacing warm continental breezes.

Freezing overnight temperatures could lead to icy roads, but with roads still warmed from the recent high temperatures the snow is unlikely to settle.

MET Office spokesman Helen Chivers said current forecasts indicated there was a slim possibility that the Shetland Islands may see some snowfall on Sunday with chances of snow in the Scottish Highlands by Tuesday.

She said: 'Cold air in the Norwegian Sea at the moment is likely to catch up with a frontal system, turning the back edge of rain over Scotland into snow.

'It will start in the high ground over 400 metres but as it moves south there will be a small risk of snow or sleet at lower levels.'

rest of the country could see widespread ground frost.

Mike Pawson enjoys the box, filled for the first time during the untypical heat

Residents on a quiet cul-de-sac were stunned when the council filled their grit box - as they were sunning themselves during one of the warmest Marches on record.

Mike Pawson was stunned when a diesel pick-up truck chugged down Plantation Avenue in Alwoodley, Leeds, West Yorkshire, and filled the long-empty grit bin.

Mr Pawson said the small street had been an ice rink for the last two years during cold weather as the bin had been empty.

He said: 'I could not believe it when they arrived.

'It has been like an ice rink the last two years because there has been no sand in the box. When it snows the council snow clearing machine does not come up to our end as it’s a cul-de-sac so it’s quite bad.

'The bin was paid for by local councillor money and the sand was much appreciated the first year we had the bin. But the following year we were told that with the cutbacks there was no more sand available.

'I’m amazed they’ve decided to bring it now it’s so warm.'

The blue grit bin had been bought with councillor ward funds in the winter of 2009/10.

A Leeds City Council spokeswoman said a request had been received for it to be refilled in February. But because of the 'cold snap', staff had been unable to do so.

Local councillors had asked that the bin still be filled with sand in preparation for the future.

Swathes
of East and South Yorkshire from Chesterfield up to Scarborough are 
officially suffering from drought, with areas around Sheffield, 
Doncaster, Hull and Driffield affected.

The
areas join the South East and eastern England in drought, most of which
has been affected since earlier this year, although parts of East 
Anglia have been suffering drought conditions since last summer.

Earlier
this month, seven water companies across east and southern England 
announced hosepipe bans would come into force before Easter in a bid to 
conserve water supplies in the face of two unusually dry winters.

Cats with no homes: The summer heat is causing havoc to cat hormones, prompting a surge of litters across the country

Britain’s unseasonably hot weather has been having an odd effect on 
our cats - causing a kitten crisis for animal rescue charities 
nationwide.

Frisky felines have seen the unusually warm winter and spring play 
havoc with their hormones causing the kitten population to rocket in 
recent months.

Experts from animal welfare charity the RSPCA have reported a large 
rise in the number of abandoned kittens and are blaming the recent warm 
weather for the increase.

Gill Lewis, who manages the RSPCA kennels in Rayleigh, Essex, said: 
'The warm weather is putting a spring in the step of our feline friends.

'We are always looking for new homes for cats and kittens but this 
year the number of adult cats being given up and kittens being handed in
is steadily increasing week on week.'

The kitten population doesn’t usually peak until later in the year as
feline ovaries become inactive during the shorter winter days with new 
litters usually arriving, at earliest, in late March.

But sunny days and warmer weather have seen mating happen throughout 
the warm winter and spring period producing an influx of kittens in 
February.

The rise has pushed kitten kennels to breaking point as people 
struggle to look after their pets in the current economic climate.

RSPCA south Essex branch volunteer Neil Fullbrook agreed adding: 'We 
certainly do think the warm weather is a factor and, with this economic 
climate, many people seem to think just dumping their pets is the 
easiest option.

'We’ve been inundated with kittens being dumped. It’s happening all over the place.'

Animal rescue charity Cats Protection has also seen a sharp rise in 
the number of unwanted kittens this year with warm weather once again to
blame.

Cats Protection’s Clinical Veterinary Officer, Beth Skillings, said: 
'Many of Cats Protection’s 287 branches and adoption centres across the 
UK have been taking in unwanted and abandoned mums and kittens from as 
early as February, when we would usually expect to see litters coming in
from March onwards.

'We have two theories as to why kitten season has started earlier. 
The first is that the warmer weather we’ve been experiencing may have 
increased food availability for cats as their prey has been awoken from 
hibernation. Increased food availability gives cats an improved body 
condition which may have had an effect on their fertility rates - hence 
more kittens born early.

'The other possibility is that there are simply more unneutered 
queens this year than last year. This could be as a result of people not
neutering their pets due to the current financial situation. This lack 
of neutering could be causing more kittens to be born, in 
proportionately larger numbers earlier in the season.

'Either way, this could signal an even worse kitten crisis this year 
as our branches and centres are currently full to capacity caring for 
around 6,000 cats so this could seriously affect our ability to help.

'The best thing owners can do is get their cats neutered as this will
help prevent unwanted litters of kittens. Cats Protection recommends 
neutering from four months of age. Cats are prolific breeders, and if 
not neutered a female cat can be responsible for 20,000 offspring in 
just five years.'

Yorkshire Water - which serves 4.7million customers - said it did not anticipate any restrictions such as hosepipe bans at the moment.

The company said its reservoirs were 
at 94 per cent, which was normal for the time of year, but groundwater 
levels in East Yorkshire were around a fifth below usual levels.

As
a result, the amount of water being taken from aquifers had been 
reduced and Hull’s water supply was being supported by water drawn from 
the River Derwent.

In a statement, the company said: 'As
the dry weather continues, we will be keeping the local water resource 
situation under constant review.

Some parts of Yorkshire have seen the
driest 12 months since 1910 and river levels are continuing to fall, 
prompting the Environment Agency to urge farmers and businesses taking 
water from rivers to use supplies wisely.

Trevor Bishop, head of water 
resources, said: 'South and east Yorkshire have moved into 
official drought status, reflecting the impact that this extremely dry 
period is having on the environment in the area.

'The Environment Agency must balance 
the water needs of people, farmers, businesses and the environment and 
we are working with businesses, farmers and water companies to plan 
ahead to meet the challenges of a continued drought.'

The news of drought conditions 
spreading to Yorkshire comes after the Environment Agency warned that 
drought would affect more parts of the country without well-above 
average rainfall in the coming weeks.
