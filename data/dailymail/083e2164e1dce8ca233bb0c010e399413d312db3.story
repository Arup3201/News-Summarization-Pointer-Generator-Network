A children's spider-man fancy dress outfit has been recalled by Asda due to safety fears after a parent complained the battery pack blew up and flew across his living room.

The £12.50 light-up costume has been taken off shelves across the country after an investigation by the supermarket chain discovered a fault with the battery.

The investigation was sparked after a complaint from Steve Slaughter, who bought the  outfit for his  son Stephen to wear on World Book Day.

Mr Slaughter, from Middlesbrough, complained to Asda earlier this month after the detachable chest piece - containing a battery pack - appeared to blow up and flew across the living room.

Fortunately it was not being worn at the time by four-year-old Stephen.

'I'm not a scientist and I don't know much about batteries but this thing is potentially lethal,' the 57-year-old reportedly told the Middlesbrough Evening Gazette.

'The box literally flew across the floor with a huge force and landed at my feet.

'When I looked to see what happened I found the bottom part of the batteries had been blown away.'

A spokeswoman for Asda said: 'Asda George has issued a recall of its Spider-man light-up dress-up costume.

'The wrong batteries have been included inside the costume's removable light-up unit resulting in a potential safety issue.

'The care and safety of our customers is our number one priority, which is why we have taken the precautionary decision to recall the product based on the outcome of our investigation.'

Customers who have already purchased the costume have been advised to return it and claim a full refund.
