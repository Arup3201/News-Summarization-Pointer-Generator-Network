A little boy with a severe allergy to tomatoes was rushed to hospital after ketchup nearly killed him.

Ruben Curie, two, from Rhondda in Wales, went into anaphylactic shock after he stuck his finger in one of his sibling’s dinner.

His parents Kasie and Wayne Curie say they will never take him to McDonalds after fearing he would die during the reaction.

The moment little Ruben, two, was rushed to hospital by ambulance after touching the tomato ketchup

Kasie Curie, 24, feared son Ruben, two, would die after he swelled up so much he could hardly breathe

The toddler was just a year old when his face and tongue swelled so badly he could no longer breathe properly.

Mrs Curie, 24, said: ‘When I saw his face was so swollen I honestly thought he was going to die.'

It was in September 2013 when she served her other children dinner with tomato ketchup that Ruben touched the sauce and got a small bit on the end of his finger.

His mother wiped off the ketchup and put him to bed.

Later that night when his brother, Craig, four, began making a lot of noise upstairs Mr Curie, 40, went to check on him.

He quickly returned with Ruben in his arms who had gone into anaphylactic shock.

His worried mother said: ‘I was hysterical. I couldn’t look at him.

‘My husband had to stay with him while I waited outside and called the ambulance. I was so scared that we might lose him.’

He was rushed to hospital by ambulance where medics gave him steroids and antihistamines.

Within 20 minutes his face had settled down and he was able to breathe normally.

Mrs Curie said: ‘We were discharged quite quickly as his face stopped being as puffy.

‘It wasn’t until the next morning when he started to look like himself again.’

Doctors suggested that the tomatoes may have been the cause.

To prevent the toddler facing a severe reaction again all of his food has to be specially prepared for nursery.

The boy was initially diagnosed with acne but doctors later discovered he was suffering from eczema

‘The thought of him touching one of the other children’s tomatoes or ketchup still scares me and we are always on edge.

‘We steer clear or places like McDonald’s because we know there is going to be ketchup everywhere.’

She added: ‘I was amazed that something as simple as ketchup could have such a reaction.’

Developing an allergy to tomatoes or tomato-based products is 'extremely rare', according to Healthline.

Doctors believe an individual with a tomato allergy is also prone to allergic reactions with other nightshades, including potatoes, tobacco, and eggplant.

Healthline also say people with a tomato allergy will have a cross-reaction to latex as well (latex-fruit syndrome).

Despite its rarity there has been some tragedy with tomato allergies. In 2004, a woman from Kent suffered a freak allergic reaction to tomatoes and died while preparing dinner for her four children.

Raya French was opening a tin of spaghetti bolognese when the tomatoes in the sauce sent her into anaphylactic shock.

The 37-year-old, from Tankerton in Kent, was taken to hospital after she collapsed, but never regained consciousness.

She was allowed to die four days later when the family decided that she had no chance of survival.

It took a year for the family to realise that Ruben had an allergy to the red fruit as he was initially diagnosed with acne.

The toddler would scratch the spots that appeared when he was a few weeks old to such an extent he would be covered in blood.

This later led doctors to diagnose him with eczema and he was prescribed emollient cream Diprobase and then steroids, but the skin problems got progressively worse.

Mrs Curie said: ‘It was horrible for us seeing him like that. He was one of the happiest babies you could ever see when he wasn’t scratching, but he was very distressed by it.’

His parents then noticed that meals containing tomatoes left the toddler with hives all over his skin.

‘We cut all tomatoes out of his diet, and this seemed to help with the majority of his symptoms,’ added Mrs Curie.

Since
 the ketchup incident, he has had another three anaphylactic incidents 
despite his eagle-eyed parents keeping a constant watch over him.

‘He went into shock after eating a single baked bean.

‘He put it in his mouth and he started getting hives and other symptoms.’

The incidents were not as severe as with the tomato ketchup but he was still rushed to hospital.

Mrs
 Curie’s other children Craig, four, and Faith, five, know how serious 
Ruben’s allergy is so make sure to keep anything containing tomato away 
from him.

The 
couple’s latest addition, 13-week old baby Daisy, will be taught when 
she is old enough that Ruben cannot be touched by what could be a deadly
 tomato.

Mrs Curie said: ‘He is an amazing little boy and I wouldn’t change him at all.

‘I do worry about tomatoes coming into contact with him, but I think as he gets older he will just stay out of their way.’
