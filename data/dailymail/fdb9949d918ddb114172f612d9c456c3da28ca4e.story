A cross-dressing husband has been cleared of assaulting his wife over claims she hid his high heels, wigs and dresses while potential buyers were looking around their home.

Alex Mackay, 64, who leads a double life as a woman called Jilly, accused his wife of a 'cover-up' after £7,000 worth of his clothing and accessories went missing from their house in Dumfries.

Police were called when his wife Liz accused the father-of-two of shouting, swearing and pushing her, Dumfries Sheriff Court heard.

The former Imperial Chemical Industries worker faced charges of assault and breach of the peace – but a jury found him not guilty.

The couple's marriage  ended in 2008 after Mr Mackay came out as a transvestite and he described his life as a 'living hell' since the split.

They decided to sell their home and although estate agents told them to stay away during viewings, they ignored this advice and trouble flared when Mr MacKay could not find his high heels.

Speaking after the hearing, Mr MacKay told the Dumfries & Galloway Standard: 'I never touched her. Since I came out as a transvestite, my life has been a living hell. 

'Despite all the hassle, I've no regrets because I'm finally able to be who I want to be.

'I enjoy life as a man but when I'm dressed as a woman I feel much more confident.

The former Imperial Chemical Industries worker said he is 'finally at ease with who he is' and is now a ladies size 12.

'For many years I never told anybody and I conformed to other people's expectations,' he said.

'It was a relief when I could finally be who I wanted to be.'

The father-of-two has been taken to court three times over allegations including assault and breach of the peace although has been found not guilty twice with the other case not proven.

His alter-ego only makes an appearance about once a month and he said he has 'no regrets'.
