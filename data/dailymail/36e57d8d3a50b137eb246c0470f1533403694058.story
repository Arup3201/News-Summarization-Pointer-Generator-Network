Missing: The body found on a popular tourist beach is believed to be Zara Broughton who has not been seen for over a week

A body found on a beach at a popular tourist spot is believed to be that of a woman missing for over a week, police have confirmed.

Zara Broughton vanished from her home on May 30, taking no money or phone with her.

Officers and a helicopter rescue team had scoured the coastal area looking for her.

Two days later her car was found at a campsite near the coast, in Dorset, and now the body has been discovered a short distance away.

A police spokesman said: 'Dorset Police received report of a body found on the beach at Durdle Door.

'The coroner has been informed but no formal identification has yet taken place.

'It is believed the body is that of missing 28-year-old Zara Broughton.'

Miss Broughton was last seen driving a black Renault Clio - the car abandoned at the Durdle Door campsite, near the famous stone arch headland.

She had left her home in Wimborne, Dorset, at 10.30pm on May 30.

As police mounted a search for her a few days ago they confirmed that the car had been where it was found since at least Saturday, June 1.
