North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un has been photobombed by two soft toys while visiting an orphanage. 

Kim seen oblivious as he leaned against a bed, that two soft toys had been placed in a compromising position on a wardrobe in the corner of the room. 

The front toy had a satisfied smirk and a cheeky wink while its grey-and-white compatriot approached it from behind.

Kim Jong-Un was seen without a cane according to North Korean for the first time since undergoing surgery

In the orphanage photograph, Kim is pictured holding what appears to be a cigarette as he rests against a pink bed.

When he returned in October, he was walking with a pronounced limp despite the use of a cane. 

North Korean media released the images of Kim in a bid to show that he had recovered from his recent health scares. 

One of the new images showed Kim walking past a chair while inspecting soldiers. In a second photograph, Kim was photographed standing while clapping his hands.

Earlier Kim appeared at a number of events using a black cane for support, including when he inspected the cockpit of a North Korean fighter jet. 

Kim Jong-Un's father Kim Jong-Il died in 2011. Since then, the dictator has regularly appeared at public events in North Korea, being photographed. 

Hundreds of troops clapped as Kim walked several yards in front of them without any walking aid 

After returning to public view last month, Kim Jong-Un was photographed using a large black cane 

The images appeared in the official newspaper of the North Korean Communist Party 

Since his return to public view, it is understood that Kim has ordered the execution of several leading members of the communist party. 

One top military official was dragged from his home and shot by firing squad after he changed several of the words of a socialist anthem during a karaoke session. 

Instead of singing 'hate your enemies, love your country', the official chanted 'hate your wife, love your mistress.'

Several other officials were believed to have been executed after they were reported for watching South Korean soap operas.
