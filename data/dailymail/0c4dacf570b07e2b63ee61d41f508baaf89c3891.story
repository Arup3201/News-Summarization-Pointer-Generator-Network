Fewer than one in five jobs are now taxpayer-funded in a boost for David Cameron’s claim to a private sector-led recovery.

New figures reveal has public sector employment has fallen 104,000 in a year to 5.67 million, equivalent to 19 per cent of all jobs – the lowest level since records began 14 years ago.

By contrast there are 380,000 more private sector workers than a year ago, taking the total number to a record high of 24.17 million.

New figures from the Office for National Statistics show how in the last decade public sector jobs have fallen from 5.9million to 5.7million

Mr Cameron seized on the figures in Prime Minister’s Questions as proof the government’s economic plan is working, pointing out that there are now 1.4million private sector jobs than when the coalition was formed.

It means that 81 per cent of all workers are now employed by private firms.

The Office for National Statistics said today that in June 2013 there were 5.67 million people employed in the public sector, down 34,000 in March this year.

At the same time the number of private sector employees hit 24.17 million, up 114,000 from in March.

The proportion of people employed by the state, including in schools, hospitals and local government, peaked at 22.1 per cent at the end of 2009, as the last Labour government sought to shield the public sector from the impacts of the financial crash.

Speaking in the Commons today, Mr Cameron said: ‘Unemployment is now lower than it was at the general election, and the number of new net private sector jobs, which we have said was 1.3 million, is now 1.4 million, which is very welcome.’

And he turned his fire on the Labour party’s repeated opposition to the government’s economic plan.

Mr Cameron said: ‘The Opposition told us that there would be no growth without plan B. Well, we have growth. They told us that unemployment would go up, not down.

‘They told us that growth of private sector jobs would never make up for the loss of public sector jobs.'

The unemployment rate now stands at 7.7 per cent, down from a peak of 8.4 per cent two years ago

Prime Minister David Cameron hailed the employment figures, with Chancellor George Osborne (centre) looking on

The PM went on: ‘They have been wrong on every single one of those issues.

‘Of course we need to do more to help with living standards, but the only way to help with living standards sustainably is to deliver growth in the economy, and we are; to keep interest rates and mortgage rates low, and we are; and to cut people’s taxes by raising the personal allowance.

‘All the things this Government have done; things his Government would never do.’

The number of women in work for May to July 2013 was 13.89 million, 318,000 higher than five years previously.

‘This increase in female employment over the last five years was almost entirely due to part-time employment,’ the ONS said.

The number of people claiming 
Jobseeker's Allowance fell in August by 32,600 from July to 1.4 million,
today’s figures also showed.

While overall employment levels have risen in the last five years, it is almost entirely due to people taking part-time jobs

While the CPI rate of inflation is running at more than 2.5 per cent, wages rose by just 1.1 per cent last month

July's claimant count was also revised lower, and the combined 68,900 fall in claimants in July and August was the biggest two-month drop since June 1997.

But the continued squeeze on household incomes was highlighted by a 1.1 per cent increase in average weekly earnings between May and July versus a year earlier.

Labour leader Ed Miliband told MPs that the only month wages had risen under the Coalition was the month when bankers delayed their bonuses to take advantage of the cut in the 50p top rate of tax.

He added: ‘We are in the middle of the slowest recovery in 100 years.’
