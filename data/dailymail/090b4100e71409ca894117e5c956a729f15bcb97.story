Fraud: Mother-of-eight Julia Deaves, 39, cheated taxpayers
out of £78,000 but walked free from court

A pregnant mother of eight who falsely claimed £78,000 by saying she was single walked free yesterday after her lawyer told the judge there was no one else to look after her children.

Julia Deaves, 39, admitted at Cardiff Crown Court to fraudulently claiming income support, housing benefit and council tax as a lone parent, while living with her partner.

Investigators became suspicious when they found official forms filled in by her common-law husband Michael Mountstephens.

A court heard Mr Mountstephens put 
Deaves down as his next of kin and used her address for work, banking 
and car insurance. He even had Deaves as a 'named driver' of his 
car.

The mother, from Ely, Cardiff, admitted fraudulently claiming income support, housing benefit and council tax as a lone mum.

The court heard how she collected more than £25,000-a-year in benefits while living with her partner who was in full employment.

Deaves turned up at Cardiff Crown Court with a suitcase ready to start a prison sentence.

But her lawyer pleaded for Deaves not to be sent to prison because of the hardship it would cause to her children.

Cora Sorenson, defending said: 'I don’t 
want to pull at the heartstrings but there is no one to fill the breach 
if she is not at home - that is the harsh reality. And quite frankly she
would do anything to avoid going into custody.'

Judge Jonathan Ferris gave her a suspended sentence after taking into account her circumstances - including her large family.

Judge Ferris told her: 'You stole £78,000 in benefits from the taxpayer and there is no prospect of repayment.

'If you took 20 people from the streets of Cardiff, at random, gave them the facts and asked what they would do with her, the majority would say send her to prison.

'This is not sentencing by democracy but that would be their opinion.'

Deaves was given a 12-month suspended sentence with a six month night-time curfew.

The court heard Deaves’ oldest daughter is 19 and expecting her second child.
