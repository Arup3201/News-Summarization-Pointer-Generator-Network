When it comes to Christmas, it seems you are never too old to take part in the festivities.

Hanging out a stocking for Santa is not just for the children, with a third of adults under the age of 55 admitting they still leave theirs near the tree each year.

And nearly one in every six adults pens a letter to Father Christmas, while one in five adults visits a grotto to visit him and his elves in person.

Family time: For many Christmas involves making bog day special for their young ones, but some adults never grow out of their own festive routines

The survey of 2,500 adults also found that many of us remain big kids at heart, with one in three of 25-34 year olds given an advent calendar by their parents.

We also remain fans of timeless traditions, with the research revealing the most special Christmas moment for adults is decorating the tree and seeing the Christmas lights being switched on.

When it comes to food, 52 per cent think their family roast is unbeatable. As a result, more than half of cooks follow their mum’s Christmas recipes to the letter, while 50 per cent of us follow the same Christmas day schedule we enjoyed growing up.

Tony Berry, from the National Trust, which carried out the poll, said: ‘Our research highlights how important traditions are to families at Christmas time, and so this year, National Trust places around the UK will be rekindling the magic of a family Christmas with events that embrace traditions old and new.

'Whether carolling, making your own decorations or mince pie tasting, our Christmas activities are the perfect way to enjoy some of the nation’s favourite customs - whatever your age!’

The conservation charity is inviting everyone to share in the magic of festive traditions old and new, as National Trust venues will be decked out with Christmas sparkle for all the family to enjoy.

Over the yuletide season special events will take place across many of its sites, bringing spirit of Christmas to life, from food and crafts to winter lights displays and atmospheric grottoes.
