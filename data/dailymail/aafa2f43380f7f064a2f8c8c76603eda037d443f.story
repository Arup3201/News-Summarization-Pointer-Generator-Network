Celebrities turned out in force for the launch of Rio Ferdinand's autobiography on Thursday night.

Tennis legend Boris Becker, England rugby player Ugo Monye and comedians Jack Whitehall and Micky Flanagan were among the stars in attendance at the Mayfair Hotel in London's West End.

Ferdinand's brother, Anton, was also at the launch of #2sides. The Reading defender was involved in the explosive court case with John Terry that saw the Chelsea captain cleared of racially abusing the then QPR centre-back.

Rio criticised the Kick It Out anti-racism campaign for failing to support his younger sibling in the former England skipper’s memoirs, only for Lord Herman Ouseley to claim Ferdinand had treated the organisation as a ‘punchbag’.

But Ferdinand said: ‘I haven’t got a personal feud (with him). He can say what he wants, I’m not bothered by what he says.

‘The time came for Kick It Out to stand up and be heard and be seen, and they weren’t.’
