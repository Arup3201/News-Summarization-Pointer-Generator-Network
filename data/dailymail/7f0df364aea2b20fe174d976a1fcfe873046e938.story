A combat veteran used his army skills to gain access to a hospital so decrepit it has even been abandoned by gangs.

The 1960s building, which closed in 1993, was once the celebrated South West Detroit Hospital.

But now it is partially submerged in brown icy water with doors riddled with bullet holes and graffiti that reads 'Bang, bang,' 'you're next' and 'don't open, dead inside'.

A combat veteran used his army skills to gain access to the former South West Detroit Hospital. The building, which was transformed into the United Community Hospital in 1996, has been empty for nearly ten years and is covered in graffiti inside and outside

Despite 'private property' and 'no tresspassing' (sic) being written down the side of the building it is clear that people have continued to enter

One bit of graffiti, written in 2014, even reads: 'Ebola will kill us all.' 

The eerie set of photographs were taken by photojournalist and former soldier Robert Johnson.

The 40-year-old discovered hundreds of medical records, old newspapers and staff time-cards as he explored the building.

After taking the photographs he wrote on Twitter: 'It was one surprise after another in Detroit's abandoned United Community Hospital #InsideDetroit.' 

The bottom levels and lifts of the hospital are filled with brown water, which has frozen solid in some places. While most of the building is empty some of the old equipment has been left to rust

One of the old elevators is covered in more than 30 bullet holes and has the words 'bang bang' written in red spray paint

White wallpaper is seen peeling off the walls of some of the old hospital bays with 'youre next' (sic) scrawled on the patterned curtains

One ominous warning written in red pen reads: 'Ebola will kill us all.' It is dated 2014 - eight years after the building was last occupied

An old brown treatment chair is surrounded by broken glass and debris. The photographs are part of a series called Inside Detroit and were captured by ex-soldier Robert Johnson

He wrote on Pixable: 'Driving through Detroit, abandoned commercial buildings of all types rise up from the mass of vacant homes to catch the eye. 

'After several days, this modern structure had drawn my attention enough that I stopped to take a closer look.' 

The South West Detroit Hospital was originally designed to serve more than 200,000 residents.

It was sold to businessman Harley Brown for $1.5million in 1996 after declaring bankruptcy five years earlier. He re-opened the building in 1997 as the United Community Hospital but a decade later it was empty again.

It is not known what the future plans are for the building.  

Some of the upper levels have escaped being flooded but are filled with broken furniture covered in graffiti. Rubbish and dust cover the floor

A broom and other bits of old wood float in the brown water, which has slowly risen through the bottom levels of the building

Old bits of machinery have been left in their place and are now submerged. The 40-year-old photographer said: 'This modern structure had drawn my attention enough that I stopped to take a closer look'

It is not known how Mr Johnson managed to get around the old building. The lifts are frozen in place whereas the stairs are rotting

What looks like a blue mattress can be seen at the far end of one of the wards, semi-submerged in the murky water. Further plans for the building are not known
