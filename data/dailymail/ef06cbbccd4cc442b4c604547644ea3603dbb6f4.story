Forget living in a youth-obsessed society, when it comes to looking good, celebrities in their 30s are our ultimate 'fitspiration'.

Beyonce, 33, Nicole Scherzinger, 36, Madonna, 56, and Elle Macpherson, 50, stole the top spots in a survey of fittest body parts, beating 20-somethings like Rosie Huntingdon-Whiteley, 27, Kate Upton, 22,  and Millie Mackintosh, 24, to the top places.

The research shows our focus has shifted from younger celebrities to that of older more ‘realistic’ and ‘attainable’ stars.

In the survey by BodyBuilding Warehouse, Michelle Keegan, 27, was the only celebrity aged under 30 to be voted number one by women, beating curvy beauties Kelly Brook and Kate Upton to the crown for 'best breasts'.

Meanwhile, Nicole Scherzinger's Pussycat Dolls-honed abs beat those belonging to Beyonce, Rihanna and Cheryl Cole, snatching the title of women's best celebrity stomach.

Supermodel  Elle 'The Body' Macpherson's may be 50 but her pins were strides ahead of lingerie range rival Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, model Miranda Kerr and former Made In Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh.

Beyonce's bottom came up number one, with Kylie Minogue, Pippa Middleton and Rihanna tailing behind. 

Super-fit 56-year-old Madonna's infamously ripped biceps beat those of Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Aniston, to be crowned best arms.

This trend for admiring older stars was also reflected in the men's lists, which were topped by Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Gosling and Cristiano Ronaldo. 

When it comes to arms, it seems size is everything, as men rated the bulging biceps of 46-year-old G.I. Joe star and former wrestler, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson number one.

Will Smith and True Blood hunk Joe Manganiello lost out to Hollywood 34-year-old hearthrob, Ryan Gosling's chiselled chest, which stole the top spot.

1. Best breasts - Michelle Keegan (27)

2. Best abs - Nicole Scherzinger (36)

3. Best legs - Elle Macpherson (50)

4. Best bottom - Beyonce (33)

5. Best biceps - Madonna (56)

Meanwhile, 39-year-old rapper 50 Cent's washboard abs successfully fended off competition from Daniel Craig, 46, and supermodel David Gandy, 34, to be crowned number one.

Kieran Fisher, sports nutrition expert and founder of BodyBuilding Warehouse, said: 'It's great to see so many people being inspired by celebrity bodies of all ages – rather than just those in their teens or 20s.

'The common perception is that it is near impossible once you are past 30 to achieve fitness goals.

'it is a fact that muscle mass does diminish with age, it is by no means impossible to build and maintain a fit body through targeted workouts and good nutrition.

'These results will show people that good muscle tone and definition can be achieved, whatever their age – and will hopefully inspire a wider range of people to reach for their fitness goals.'
