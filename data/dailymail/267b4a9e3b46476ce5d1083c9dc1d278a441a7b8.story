Homesick: Maciej Maciejewski, 34, firebombed a town hall in a bid to be deported from Britain

A homesick Polish man who firebombed a town hall in a bid to be deported from Britain has been ordered to stay in the country for two more years.

Maciej Maciejewski, 34, was so desperate to return to his beloved homeland that he travelled 250 miles from his London house to Manchester.

He then created a Molotov cocktail, before setting it alight and hurling it through the doors of the city's 146-year-old town hall.

The fire was quickly extinguished by a porter and Maciejewski surrendered to police, telling them: 'I just wanted to go back to Poland.'

But his hopes of being deported were diminished after he was jailed for 24 months at Manchester Crown Court - at a cost to the taxpayer of up to £75,000.

Due to Poland being in the European Union and therefore subject to its laws on 'free movement', Maciejewski can not be legally kicked out of the UK and can only go to Poland at his own expense.

The arsonist's sentence means he will have to remain in Britain until 2016 unless he is released early for good behaviour. The public cost 
of a prison place in the UK is thought to be £37,500 a year.

Sentencing Maciejewski, Judge
 Andrew Blake told him: 'There is an old saying - if you play 
with fire, you are going to get burnt. The reason why it is regarded as 
serious is because the consequences can’t be predicted.

'Your
 motivation you say, and I have no reason to doubt this, was to get your 
fare back to Poland paid for. Well, this strategy was never going to 
work. That’s not what happens. We are a member of the EU.

'If
 you commit criminal offences in this country just as if you had 
committed criminal offences as you have in the past in Poland, you go to
 prison.

'The consequences could have been serious. There can be no doubt
 about it that you carefully planned this expedition to Manchester. It 
is inevitable that a prison sentence must follow.'

Earlier, the court heard how Maciejewski had concocted his plan to attack Manchester’s town hall because he was unemployed, penniless and thought it would be a ‘ticket back to Poland’.

He had travelled from London to the city with the sole intention of damaging the building - eschewing the capital because he liked London and ‘didn’t want to do anything there’.

On his arrival in Manchester at around midday on March 31, Maciewjewski bought petrol, poured it into an empty Budweiser bottle he had found in a bin and walked towards the town hall.

The building packed with civil servants and hundreds of conference delegates, the court heard.

In front of bystanders and office workers enjoying their lunch, he then ripped part of his t-shirt to use as a fuse, before lighting the cocktail and hurling it into the empty entrance of the town hall.

The bottle shattered when it hit the wooden frame of the door and burst into flames.

A porter quickly extinguished the fire 
after employees complained of flames and smoke, but not before the blaze
 had caused £250 worth of damage to the wooden doors of the building.

Andrew Mackintosh, prosecuting, said Maciejewski, who has lived in England since 2008, had lost his travel documentation so was not eligible for work in this country, which had left him broke.

He added: 'In interview he stated that he had come from Poland and had been living in London and that he had lost his documentation and had no means of getting work in this country and that he wanted to return to Poland.

'He had sought the help of the Polish Embassy but was not assisted. He decided to travel from London where he had been living rough to commit this offence in the hope he would be sent back.

'He had no intention of hurting anybody. He said what he did was a ticket back to Poland.'

Maciejewski, who had 15 previous convictions including one in Poland for assaulting a public official, asked through his barrister if any prison sentence could be served in his native country.

However, his request was declined by Judge Blake.

Max
 Saffman, defending, acknowledged his client had ‘failed to acknowledge 
the particular danger’ of hurling a lit bottle of petrol at a building 
full of people, but said it had caused only minor damage.

'There is a perverse logic in his actions. His thinking is perhaps he intended to commit an act of criminal damage but used fire for that,' he said.

'For no sooner had it started it was put out by an eagle-eyed security guard. It was £250 worth of damage - not a considerable amount.

'He didn’t wish for anybody to be hurt. He just wished to be returned to Poland as soon as possible.'

Maciejewski was not ordered to pay any compensation for the damage caused.
