An opulent, Bavarian-style hotel straight out of a fairytale has been unveiled in Dalian, in northeast China.

The Castle Hotel is open for business after extensive renovations on the property, which sits majestically on top of Wanxia Mountain, overlooking Xinghai Bay and the  Yellow Sea.

The palatial property is part of The Luxury Collection, and managed by Starwood Hotels & Resorts.

Looking like the setting for Beauty and the Beast or Sleeping Beauty, the property features stone turrets, manicured gardens and a magnificent marble lobby. 

Guests are treated to a 450 square-metre indoor pool and a 2,000-square-metre Kaiser SPA with beautiful ocean views from every treatment room.

There are 292 rooms and 29 luxurious suites. Travellers can get a taste of the fairy tale from as little as £95 per night for a standard room.
