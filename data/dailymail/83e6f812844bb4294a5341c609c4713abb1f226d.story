Barcelona's convincing 3-1 loss against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu has prompted Spanish newspapers to question Luis Enrique's team.

Cristiano Ronaldo, Pepe and Karim Benzema shattered a Barcelona side that ran out of answers after a fourth-minute goal from Neymar initially silenced the 85,500 crowd in Madrid.

Spanish newspaper Sport take aim at the ages of Barcelona's starting XI on their front page, writing that the La Liga giants had 'six player with 30 or more years and a 28.6 years average'.

Likewise, AS don't hold back. The Spanish newspaper write that 'the Bernabeu Clasico sends Barca into depression' and that it was 'more than a victory' for Carlo Ancelotti's men.

Barcelona remain joint top of the La Liga table with Sevilla but the defeat moved Real within one point of their most fierce rivals. 

Lionel Messi was lost on the big stage as Ronaldo stole the show with a 35th-minute penalty.

Finally from Spain, Marca opt to focus on the brilliance of Real manager Ancelotti.

Following the win, he is hailed as 'more valued than ever' at the Bernabeu.
