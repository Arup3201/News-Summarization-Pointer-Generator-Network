Residents in a quiet cul-de-sac were shocked to discover a pet cat had been decapitated, its paws cut off and a threatening message painted in the animal's blood on a garage door.

Rhonda Gibson, who lives a few doors down from the targeted house on Hazel Court in Arundel, told the MailOnline the Gold Coast suburb is usually very quiet as most of the residents are either retired or young families.

'It's a really quiet area and there's lots of retired people in the area.'

A message was left on a garage door at a Gold Coast home in the early hours of this morning while their car was set on fire

'Nothing much ever really happens here.'

When news  that a cat had been mutilated a few houses down reached the Gibsons, as cat owners they were very upset.

'Of course that makes you feel ill, but thankfully it wasn't our cat,' Mrs Gibson said.

She also said residents in the house next-door to the targeted home told her they felt the force of the fiery car when the explosion rattled their windows and shook their home.

There had been no previous trouble in the street, and the residents of the house involved were not known to Mrs Gibson or her husband.

An investigation is underway after a car was also set alight outside the same home in Queensland in the early hours of Tuesday.

The torched vehicle, a Toyota Corolla, belonged to the homeowners.

A gruesome message left on the exterior of the house, in what's believed to be cats blood read: 'Whers (sic) my money? Tik Tok!'.

Residents and neighbours were woken by a loud explosion around 2.45am and police found the severely mutilated cat near the burning vehicle.

The cat's head was left at the front door of the house.

People thought to be the homeowners were seen cleaning the graffiti off the garage door later on Tuesday morning.

Senior Sergeant William Lithgow from Southport Station told the MailOnline the incident appears likely to be an ongoing matter with the occupants.

'It's not a random act, the home was targeted specifically.'

The cat had been 'decapitated and otherwise dismembered', though the animal did not belong to residents at the home, Senior Sergeant Lithgow said.

'Police are continuing to investigate and the occupants are cooperating.'

Detective acting Inspector Greg Aubort said the occupants were disturbed by the message.

However, he would not say whether they had an idea who was responsible or if there were likely to be organised crime links.

'We're interviewing the occupants and looking for motives of any persons of interest that might be involved,' he told said.

Insp Aubort said given the nature of the incident, police were eager to catch the culprits as soon as possible.

'It's an abhorrent attack on an animal,' he said.

'I think any case where you have the intentional killing or maiming of an animal is a disgusting act and we'll certainly be looking to prosecute those responsible to full extent of the law.'

RSPCA Queensland has offered a $5000 reward to help catch those responsible for the incident.

'They cannot get away with this,' CEO Mark Townend said.

'This is one of the worst acts of animal cruelty that the RSPCA has seen.'

Mr Townend said he feared the offender would strike again.

'It's a stepping stone to violence against people,' he said.

Investigations are ongoing and anyone with information have been urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
