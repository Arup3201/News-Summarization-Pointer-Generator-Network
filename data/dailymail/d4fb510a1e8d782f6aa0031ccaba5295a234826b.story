Wellness guru Sarah Wilson has weighed in on the Belle Gibson controversy, saying too many health bloggers do not understand their power and responsibility.

Ms Gibson, founder of the popular Whole Pantry app, has faced intense criticism since doubts were raised about whether she has terminal cancer.

Ms Wilson, author of I Quit Sugar, told Daily Mail Australia that the incident was 'unfortunate' and that health bloggers have a huge responsibility to their followers.

'The real issue that's going on is there's a lot of people out there not taking on board the responsibility that comes with all this,' she said.

I Quit Sugar author Sarah Wilson told Daily Mail Australia many bloggers are 'not taking on board the responsibility' that comes with publishing

Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson last week said she would issue an explanatory statement, but it has not materialised

'I don't know that you need to be a dietitian to share information about your health journey.

'If you are somebody who works online and you claim to be a (health) blogger you have to take on certain responsibilities.

'You have to ensure you train yourself up in all of that (science). That's what I see isn't happening. 

'There's a lot of people out there who are't taking on the responsibility of being a disseminator of information.

'We've got to be very transparent and acknowledge the science is not categorical - but respect the science that is there.' 

Ms Wilson has said in a blog about the issue that 'diet can't cure disease'.  

Ms Gibson has stayed mum about her health since admitting in an interview with The Australian that her previous claims cancer had spread to her blood, spleen, uterus and liver may have been a 'misdiagnosis'. 

In the weeks since doubts were raised about Belle Gibson's cancer and charitable donations, her US and Australian publishers have withdrawn support for her recipe books

In the weeks since, her US and Australian publishers have withdrawn support for her recipe books. 

The Whole Pantry iPhone app has been removed from the Apple Store and her much-touted Apple Watch app is no longer showcased on the technology company's website. 

In an interview with Daily Mail Australia last Tuesday, Ms Gibson said she understood why many of her followers were upset, but she criticised the 'maliciousness' of some critics. 

She said she would release a statement addressing concerns about her, but that it was 'taking longer than anticipated' due to 'constantly arising issues' and articles she needed to stay on top of. 

Asked if the statement would address concerns about her medical history, she said: 'Of course, and every which otherwise possible.' 

The statement has not been released and she has not responded to questions.
