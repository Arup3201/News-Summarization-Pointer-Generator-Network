Murder suspect: Yongfei Ci, 29, a University of Illinois PhD student, has been identified as the man who allegedly killed his ex-girlfriend

A 29-year-old doctoral student from University of Illinois has been arrested for allegedly killing his ex-girlfriend and locking away her roommate.

The victim, identified by police only as a 25-year-old student at UI Champaign-Urbana, was discovered murdered in her off-campus apartment this morning.

According to a press release made available to MailOnline Friday evening, an autopsy is pending to determine the woman's cause of death.

The victim's estranged boyfriend, 29-year-old PhD student Yongfei Ci, was tracked down by police and arrested a few blocks north of the crime scene just hours after the slaying.

Lt. Bryant Seraphin told The Champaign News-Gazette that officers were called shortly after 11am to 1343 North Lincoln Avenue at the One South apartment complex in Urbana.

According to the news release, the victim's roommate was in the apartment during the killing and had been locked in the bathroom by the attacker.

The woman eventually was able to free herself and ran into the courtyard, where she told a passerby about what happened. The roommate was not injured.

The university police issued alerts to students and faculty, but the campus was not locked down.

Investigators used cell phone

Drive in Champaign just before 1.30pm today.

Ci is a sixth-year PhD candidate studying math at UI. According to his profile on the university website, his research focuses on the topology and geometry of 3-manifolds.

The 29-year-old murder suspect is a Chinese citizen who had graduated from Oregon State University before being accepted into UI's PhD program in 2008.

Ci’s Facebook account has been dormant since 2010. In September 2008, the student indicated on his page that he was in a relationship, although most recently his status has been listed as ‘single.’
