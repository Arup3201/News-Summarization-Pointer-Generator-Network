Arsene Wenger has urged Arsenal to rid themselves of Europe’s gallant loser tag by grasping their Champions League second chance on Tuesday night.

The Gunners head into their second leg in Monaco trailing 3-1 following an abject display at the Emirates Stadium.

In each of the past four seasons, Arsenal have narrowly crashed out at the last 16 stage.

Arsenal were in fine form to beat West Ham on Saturday and will need to carry that momentum forward

The Gunners will need to overturn a two-goal deficit against a team who rarely concede

Last season they secured a credible 1-1 draw in Bayern Munich after losing the first leg; in 2013 Arsenal won 2-0 in the Allianz Arena only to crash out 3-2 on aggregate after a crushing first leg loss.

Three years ago, having lost 4-0 to AC Milan in the first leg, Wenger’s side staged a brilliant comeback only to fall short in a 3-0 second leg win.

And in 2011, Arsenal again missed out by a solitary goal, crashing out 4-3 on aggregate to Barcelona despite winning the first leg 2-1 at the Emirates.

And now Arsenal must perform yet another European comeback in Monaco with Wenger desperate for his side to finish the job this time.

Arsene Wenger says his team have an opportunity to right the wrongs of last month's defeat to Monaco

Mesut Ozil and Olivier Giroud cut a dejected figure while Arsenal were being beaten at home by Monaco 

‘That’s not what you want (to be called gallant losers), you want to qualify,’ said Wenger.

‘We have got it wrong in the first game. What you want in life is the chance to put it right. We have the opportunity to put it right and after, no matter what, we will be ready to give everything to do it.

‘We are in a position where Monaco are favourites. We can go there and create something special. I believe we will have the desire to do it.

‘Honestly, I’d prefer to be 3-0 up (but) we have no choice. We have to put it right.

‘Sometimes in life, you make a big mistake and there’s no comeback, no way you get the chance to put it right again.

‘In football, you can do it so let’s just give everything. Is all the pressure on Monaco? They can lose it. They’ve already won it but they can still lose it.’

Should the Gunners need a further motivation then they only have to glance at Monaco striker Dimitar Berbatov’s suggestions that his side wanted it more than the English club during the first leg.

Giroud has bounced back from a poor performance to score three times in four games since Monaco 

The Arsenal striker hit a stunning goal to put the Gunners ahead at home to West Ham on Saturday

‘We have enough experience to know that what happens on Tuesday night does not depend on statement of people, but just depends on our performance on the night,’ said the Arsenal boss.

‘I don’t believe that (Monaco wanted it more than Arsenal). I think we wanted too much to make a difference in the first game and forgot our basics.’

Meanwhile, Olivier Giroud is determined to right the wrongs of his wasteful performance in the first leg last month.

The Frenchman was heavily criticised by his own supporters for missing gilt-edged chances in the clash.

But the striker has responded well, scoring three in as many starts since the defeat to Monaco — including a brilliant strike in the win over West Ham that fired Arsenal to within a point of second-placed Manchester City.

‘I try to bounce back as quickly as I can and it’s true the boss gave me a chance to do it against Everton (after the Monaco defeat),’ said the France international.

Arsenal crashed out of the Champions League last season despite a good display against Bayern Munich

In 2012 the Gunners came close to overturning a 4-0 deficit against AC Milan, but fell just short

‘I try to do it straight away. If you let the doubts enter your head it’s even more difficult to cope.

‘There are always tough moments like that because we do a hard job. You have to question yourself every week and bounce back.

‘I try to show my answer on the pitch with my mentality. Football is a sport where you need to have a strong mentality because you have to face some difficulties.

‘Even when you play well and score a lot of goals, if you miss some everything is forgotten. You have to have a conscience about it and be aware.

‘Don’t believe the people who talk too much about football. I know when I play well or not. I know how to bounce back. I say that football is an everlasting new beginning.’
