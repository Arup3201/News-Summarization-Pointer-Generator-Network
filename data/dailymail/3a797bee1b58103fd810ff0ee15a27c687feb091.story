A photographer has come up with an unusual pet project - snapping ecstatic dogs as they hang their heads out of car windows for a new calendar.

Lara Jo Regan, 48, embarked on her task for the 2014 calendar 'Dogs in cars'.

The unusual shoot, which took place in Los Angeles, California, was aimed at exploring the unbridled joy experienced by pugs and huskies when a breeze hits their faces.

Three pugs peer out from a car window in Los Angeles, California. Photographer Lara Jo Regan admitted that the pug shot was her favourite. 
'A pug is naturally hilarious, but three of those faces slobbering in unison out the window of a moving car is an off-the-charts gut buster'

Three pocket beagles lean out of a window: Ms Regan started with dogs of friends, before placing adverts online for certain breeds she thought would work.

A labrador hanging out: 'Most dogs become downright delirious over a car ride, and I wanted to capture this amazing primal energy in photographs beyond what I'd seen before,' said Ms Regan

'I usually try to come up with ideas that are somewhat odd and complex to assure no one else is doing the same thing,' she said.

'But as an owner of three dogs living in the Los Angeles car culture, the idea was just staring me in the face.

Others were achieved 'car-to-car' with Ms Regan being driven alongside the subject in another vehicle.

Each dog now has its own online following but Ms Regan admitted her favourite shot is the three pugs in the old Volvo.

The back of the calendar, which sells for $14.99 on her website, reads: 'Is there a dog owner in the world who does not delight in the delirium of their four-legged friend on a car ride?

'This infectiously happy calendar features cruising canines of all varieties hanging in and out of automobiles, blissing out on the passing smorgasboard of smells and scenery.
