Yvonne Briscoe from Brynford, North Wales, who is suffering from bowel cancer had had to take drastic steps to get the treatment she wanted

A seriously ill cancer patient has been forced to rent a second home so she can receive life-saving treatment because of a postcode lottery in the health service.

Yvonne Briscoe, 57, wanted a drug to reduce her bowel tumour but was refused funding from doctors in her home town in North Wales.

She has been forced to take out a six month lease on a flat in Stockport, Greater Manchester, 53 miles from her family home, so she can qualify for the treatment of Cetuximab at specialist cancer hospital, The Christie, in Manchester.

The drug is not approved by NICE - the National Institute for Clinical Excellence - and is not routinely available in Wales.

But Cetuximab, which is said to prolong life for cancer sufferers who have tried other
drugs that have failed, is more accessible through the Cancer Drugs 
Fund in England.

Mrs Briscoe, whose main home is in Brynford, North Wales, applied for Cetuximab in Wales but was turned down for the drug on the grounds that her case was not exceptional.

Mrs Briscoe said: 'If my case is not an exception I don't know what it is.

'I
think it's terrible that i have to rent out a property in another 
country simply so I can get the treatment I so desperately need.

'Although this treatment is available in England, it is unavailable in Wales.

'It is all down to cost but how can you put a price on somebody's life?

'I was absolutely fuming at the decision to refuse funding - especially because I had been misdiagnosed in the first place.'

The retired council worker was misdiagnosed by her own doctor in 2008, who wrongly said the bowel cancer was irritable bowel syndrome.

Tragically, the misdiagnosis resulted in the cancer spreading to her liver and lungs.

Despite the huge blunder, Welsh doctors said Mrs Briscoe is not an 'exceptional case' for funding.

Mrs Briscoe had started chemotherapy at the Glan Clwyd Hospital, 25 minutes away from her home to target the cancer, but in October last year doctors told her that the treatment had stopped having an effect.

She asked about other treatments, determined to find a drug that would help her.

Mrs Briscoe, who lives with her husband Michael, 61, in their home in Wales, arranged to see a consultant at Christie Hospital.

Consultants said she would benefit from Cetuximab and they could treat her there.

But as she lived in Wales she wasn't able to get it.

Mrs Briscoe said: 'I felt that I had to do something drastic in order to register for the treatment.

'Renting in Stockport is not ideal but I was left with no choice.'

She has had to register with a doctor in Stockport and is paying £400 per month to rent the flat.

Mrs Briscoe is currently being treated on a weekly basis with the drug mitomycin C which is keeping the cancer stabilised and so is unable to start the Cetuximab until the treatment is finished, which is likely to be in September.

Mrs Briscoe has set up an online petition that she intends to send to the Welsh Assembly Government outlining her case and pushing for a change.

Bosses at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board say Cetuximab is still not recommended by NICE and is not routinely available in Wales as a result.

Dr Matthew Makin, chief of staff of the Cancer Clinical Programme Group, said: 'We can confirm that in this case a request was considered and no clinical exceptionality was determined and thus in accordance with policy, the request was refused.

'Whilst we have every sympathy with Ms Briscoe, we have followed the process as it stands in Wales at this time.'

The Cancer Drugs Fund was brought in by the Coalition in 2010, providing £200million for people unable to access drugs because of NICE decisions to get them funded.

The news comes shortly after a cancer 
sufferer launched a scathing attack on David Cameron for NHS failings to
fund the cancer treatment she desperately needed.
