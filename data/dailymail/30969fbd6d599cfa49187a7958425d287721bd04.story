A father whose two children were killed by his girlfriend in a car crash  has spoken of the moment she lost control of her poorly-maintained Ford Focus.

Allan Portor was in the passenger seat when Marie Easter, 44, swerved off the A47 and overturned in a Norfolk ditch, taking the lives of Tamzin, 10, and Jessica, seven, on December 27, 2012.

The girls, described as 'little angels' by their family, were on their way to the  cinema  in a car with dangerously low tyre treads, uneven tyre pressures and a slow puncture, an inquest heard today. 

Police also believe Jessica was not wearing a seatbelt at the time.

Tragedy: Jessica and Tamzin Portor, left to right, were killed in a post-Christmas crash by their father's girlfriend, who was driving a poorly-maintained vehicle

Findings: Police told the girls' inquest that Marie Easter's Ford Focus had dangerously low tyre treads, uneven tyre pressures and a slow puncture  - and believe Jessica was not wearing a seatbelt

Easter told the girls' inquest she was forced to swerve to avoid a red BMW but it was never traced by police and witnesses did not see any oncoming vehicle, the inquest heard.  

Allan Portor said in evidence he had not seen any oncoming car as he was checking messages on his phone but he believed Easter's account. He also added he believed Jessica did wear a seatbelt.

Mr Portor added: 'She suddenly shouted out 'what the f****** hell is he doing' and I looked up and she was swerving.

'There was nothing there but there was no time to look around.

'I trust her and if she says there was a car there, that's good enough for me.

'She loved those children like anything.'

Heartbroken: The girls' mother Lorraine Mason said today that people must ensure their car is safe because: 'I don't want anybody to go through what I'm going through every day of my life'

Easter admitted two charges of causing death by careless driving at Norwich Crown Court earlier this year and was given a 15-month jail term, suspended for two years. 

Norfolk coroner Jacqueline Lake recorded a conclusion that the youngsters died of multiple injuries after the car overturned.

Outside, the girls' mother, Lorraine Mason, said: 'I just want to make people aware that if you're driving a vehicle, you're responsible for it and everybody in it.

'Don't take somebody out without a seatbelt on, do check your tyres and if the tread or pressure is low, don't drive it.

'I don't want anybody to go through what I'm going through every day of my life.'

Easter admitted two charges of causing death by careless driving at Norwich Crown Court earlier this year and was given a 15-month jail term, suspended for two years.

Giving evidence today, she insisted she had been forced to swerve to avoid an oncoming vehicle on the wrong side of the road.

The road was straight and wide enough to allow for overtaking.

Asked about the condition of the car, Easter said the vehicle had been repaired on December 19 and she had been told it was safe to drive.

However, mechanics told the hearing that although the car had been booked in for repair, the appointment was missed.

Collision investigator Sgt Andy Hood said the defects could have seriously affected the car's handling.

Mr Hood added: 'It is possible the car lost traction and the driver was unable to regain control.' 

Mr Portor suffered broken ribs in the crash. His son, Liam, then 12, suffered cuts and bruises.

Easter was also injured in the crash.
