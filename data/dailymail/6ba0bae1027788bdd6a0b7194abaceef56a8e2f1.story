A man who pummelled and kicked a homeless man then left him to die in an alleyway was sentenced to life in prison today.

Steven Ray Churchis, 18, brutally murdered Edwin Linder, 42, when he found him defecating in his preferred sleeping spot in Mills Lane, central Auckland, July 2013.

Churchis performed a martial-arts style kick to Linder's head, before beating and stomping on him while he lay defenceless on the ground. A friend of Linder then reportedly poured a bottle of urine on Linder, before they left him to die, reported Ninemsn.

Churchis refused to seek medical assistance for Linder, who was left in the lane for eight hours until a member of the public alerted the authorities.

Linder suffered brain injuries and died of pneumonia in Auckland Hospital three days after the attack.

Churchis claimed he had acted in self defence, but Justice Geoffrey Venning said the force Churchis used on Linder was 'unreasonable' and the attack was 'extreme and excessive'.

'You left him without help to die.' 

Churchis was 17 and also sleeping on the streets at the time of the attack. He had reportedly had a previous altercation with Linder, as well as  a violent past. 

He was also sentenced to two years and three months' jail for an attack on another man earlier on the same night as Mr Linder was bashed.

Justice Geoffrey Venning said Linder was 'particularly vulnerable' as a small man, with physical disabilities, which Churchis must have been aware of since he had encountered Linder several times before the attack.

Family members of both the victim and his murderer were in attendance at the High Court at Auckland during the sentencing.
