A 27-year-old woman, who was saved by police after she jumped in front of a train as a depressed teenager, is suing the New York Police Department because she cannot get a job.

Yasmin Rahman claims that pictures and police reports of her failed suicide attempt were made public, which has put off potential employers.

Ms Rahman, who says she has worked through the issues that led to her trying to kill herself in 2001, when she was just 15, said she has been turned down from jobs because companies have seen details about the incident.

'It makes me feel like I’m going in circles,' Ms Rahman, who claims she has been turned down by at least 39 potential employers, told the New York Post.

In the lawsuit she filled at Queens Supreme Court last month, the psychology graduate claims she lost out on job opportunities because detailed information about her was found on background checks. 

'They asked me if I was on crutches or 
in a wheelchair. They’ve told me, "It’s a 
police report, you were injured", and, "There’s a picture of you at the 
hospital", "There’s a picture of you on the tracks",' she said.

'I don’t think people understood I was 
afraid most of my childhood. I just didn’t 
want to be home any more,' Ms Rehman from Elmhurst said.

Although she spent six months in hospital after the incident at Lexington Avenue station, and suffered a head injury, broken bones and temporary memory loss, she says her survival was a wake up call.

She enrolled at university to study psychology and has ambitions to become a counselor or caseworker, but instead has only been able to find part-time work selling cellphones.

Ms Rehman said although she has been able to find retail work, she has repeatedly been turned down for positions with hospitals and nonprofit organizations.

Attorney Andrew Schatkin, who is representing her, said information about her suicide attempt should be confidential.

'I think it’s nobody’s business,' he said.

His client is suing the city and the officers who dealt with her case.

A NYPD spokesman denied the allegations and added: 'We do not maintain a medical database.'

The city has also denied the allegations, according to its Law Department.
