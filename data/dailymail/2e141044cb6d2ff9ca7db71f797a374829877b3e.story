Stuart McCall quit as Motherwell boss - two weeks after being talked out of leaving by his employers.

The second-longest serving manager in Scottish senior football was, Sportsmail understands, ready to walk after losing 3-1 at home to Dundee a fortnight ago.

Convinced to stay on in the hope of turning around a horrific early-season run of form, McCall ultimately had his spirit broken by successive away defeats to Aberdeen and St Johnstone.

With his team sitting second bottom of the Premiership and worried that his own darkening mood had become a drag on the squad’s spirit, 50-year-old McCall - described by Motherwell directors as one of the most successful managers in their history - broke the news of his decision to club officials following a youth game against Celtic at Greenock on Sunday.

Despite further attempts to talk him round, the former Scotland and Rangers star insisted that it was time to move on.

Board member Derek Weir insisted that the directors had been willing to stand by a coach who had regularly over-achieved on a shoestring budget, finishing second in the top flight in consecutive seasons.

‘We have been acutely aware of results this season - but everyone at Fir Park was confident in his and the team’s ability to turn things around,’ said Weir.

‘However, following a long conversation this afternoon, Stuart felt it was better for all concerned if he stepped down with immediate effect and we respect that.’

Sportsmail understands that there was no pressure from within the club on McCall, whose record of success had made him as close to fireproof as it’s possible for any manager to be.

But the man himself felt that he was running out of enthusiasm for the job, fearing that he couldn’t get any more out of the group - and confessed to friends that he was beginning to dread matchday.

He was willing to hang on even after that Dundee loss, however, because he felt he owed the club his best effort to improve.

Last Friday night’s 2-1 defeat to St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park appears to have been the last straw.

An official club statement released last night heaped praise on the departing head coach, saying: ‘Motherwell FC can announce Stuart McCall has resigned from his position as manager.

McCall was the second longest-serving manager in Scottish football before his resignation on Sunday

‘McCall , who was appointed in December 2010 and was the second longest serving manager in Scottish senior football (after Forfar bos s Dick Campbell) informed the board of his decision late this afternoon.

‘The 40-times capped former Scotland midfielder has overseen a period of incredible success at Fir Park, including taking Motherwell into the Scottish Cup Final in 2011, then three ‘Best of the Rest’ finishes in the Scottish top flight.

‘As manager, he smashed a number of long-standing records, including for games won, goals scored, clean sheets and points accumulated; the 50-year old also led Motherwell into the UEFA Champions League for the first and only time back in 2012.

‘In contrast, the current season hasn’t started as well as anyone would like.’

Weir, who was instrumental in McCall’s appointment almost four years ago, confirmed that assistant manager Kenny Black will act as caretaker until a new manager is found.

He added: ‘Everyone at Motherwell FC would like to sincerely thank Stuart for his contribution to the club, which will go down as one of the most successful managerial tenures in our 128-year history.’

St Johnstone's victory over Motherwell on Friday proved to be the final straw for long-serving McCall

There are echoes of McCall’s resignation from Bradford City in 2010, when he stepped down under very little pressure from the board - arguing that he couldn’t take the team any further.

Under his guidance, Motherwell regularly left clubs with bigger finances trailing - as well as turning Michael Higdon into Scotland’s Player of the Year.

Each summer brought fresh cuts to his budget, however, and McCall spent almost every close season bidding farewell to the previous campaign’s best performers.

He has become a valued member of Gordon Strachan’s Scotland staff since his appointment, on a part-time basis, in January 2013.

Bookies immediately installed former Ross County boss Derek Adams as favourite for the Fir Park job, followed by Terry Butcher, Gary Locke, Ian Murray, Owen Coyle and Jimmy Calderwood.
