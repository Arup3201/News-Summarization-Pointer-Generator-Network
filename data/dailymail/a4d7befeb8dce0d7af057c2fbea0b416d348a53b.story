The SIAC said in a statement: 'The obligation to observe basic principles of sportsmanship and fair play extends to all participants at the SIAC basketball tournament. 

'As a consequence of the incident on Tuesday, the cheerleading and dance teams from both Albany State University and Tuskegee University will not be permitted to participate in our tournament for the remainder of the week.'

A statement on Tuskegee University's website said the college was 'disappointed by the incident which occurred between the cheerleaders of Tuskegee University and Albany State during Tuesday’s 2015 SIAC Tournament at the Bill Harris Arena in Birmingham, Alabama.

'The university does not condone any conduct unbecoming of a Tuskegee University student. The university will conduct its own investigation, in accordance with the Student Handbook Code of Conduct.'

Albany State athletic director Richard Williams said that the incident would be reviewed and promised 'appropriate action.'

'We expect our student-athletes and representatives to conduct themselves accordingly; anything less is unacceptable,' Williams said in a statement, according to AP.
