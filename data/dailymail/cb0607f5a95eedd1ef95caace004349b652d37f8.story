A mother-of-four has written an hilarious open letter to her son's female Facebook friends, warning them they will be blocked if they post sexual 'selfies'.

Kim Hall, who lives in Austin, Texas with her husband, their three sons and a daughter, wrote the post entitled 'FYI (If You're a Teenage Girl)' on her blog on Tuesday.

It has since been viewed more than five million times and has received support from thousands of moms from across the country - although others slammed it for being 'self-righteous'.

'Dear ladies,' the post on Given Breath begins, before slating the girls for uploading images of sexual poses in their bedrooms to Facebook and urging them to have more self respect.

Warning: Kim Hall, pictured with one of her sons, wrote a terse letter to her sons' girl friends on her blog, warning them that if they continued to post sexual photographs of themselves, she would block them on their Facebooks

'We have teenage sons, and so 
naturally there are quite a few pictures of you lovely ladies to wade 
through,' she wrote. 'Wow – you sure took a bunch of selfies in your 
pajamas this summer!

'Your bedrooms are so cute! Our eight-year-old daughter brought this to our attention, because with three older brothers who have rooms that smell like stinky cheese, she notices girly details like that.'

But Hall, who is the director of women's ministry at All Saints PCA in Austin, said that teen boys will notice other things: 'For one, it appears that you are not wearing a bra,' she wrote.

She also quizzed the girls about why they are striking 'red-carpet poses' before going to bed.

'What's up?,' she asked. 'None of these positions is one I naturally assume before sleep, this I know.'

She said that, while it appeared as if 
she was giving the girls a hard time for their choices of pictures, she 
was in fact encouraging them to celebrate the best parts of themselves.

Tickled: Mrs Hall, pictured with her family, poked fun at the girls for their pouts and sultry bedroom poses

Having a laugh: She urged girls to take down their selfies which she said were not natural sleeping poses

'Those posts don’t reflect who you are!' she wrote. 'We think you are lovely and interesting, and usually very smart. But... what are you trying to say?'

She said that she regularly checks her sons' social media pages with them and, if they discover images such as the sultry poses, friends will be blocked because she cares about what the boys see.

Hall added that there are no second 
chances and that those who wish to stay friendly with the family must 
keep their 'clothes on'.

'If
 you try to post a sexy selfie, or an inappropriate YouTube video – even
 once – you'll be booted off our on-line island,' she wrote.

She acknowledged that some people may 
think her actions are 'old-school' but that she simply wanted to raise 
boys with 'a strong moral compass'.

Close: She said she was being 'old school' as she wants her boys to grow up with a strong moral compass

Encouragement: Mrs Hall, who has one daughter (pictured), told the girls they were beautiful on the inside and out and didn't need to post the pictures on Facebook to prove anything

'Every day I pray for the women my boys will love,' she wrote. 'I hope they will be drawn to real beauties, the kind of women who will leave them better people in the end.

'I also pray that my sons will be worthy of this kind of woman, that they will be patient – and act honorably – while they wait for her.'

She urged girls to take down their previously posted inappropriate selfies.

'You are growing into a real beauty, inside and out,' she said to the girls. 'Act like her, speak like her, post like her.'

The blog post received mixed
 responses from readers - mostly because Mrs Hall had included photos of
 her sons in bathing suits to accompany the words.

After some readers said this gave a confusing message, she re-posted the blog with images of the boys with their clothes on.

Mixed responses: The original post sparked confusion as it included shirtless pictures of her sons

Critical: She slammed teenage girls for taking inappropriate 'selfies' - pictures they take of themselves (file picture)

But some readers still took issue with her opinions and delivery.

'I understand the point your article was trying to make,' one wrote, 'but you came across as holier than thou rather than a humble servant of God. I would rather have seen you rewrite the article with a less judgmental tone than just repost it with new pictures and a snarky new title.'

Yet others thanked the mother for the letter, with one writing: 'Way to go, Kim! As a mom of two boys and two girls, I agree with you 100%!'

The blog post has been read more than five million times, she wrote on Facebook on Wednesday.

Mrs Hall lives with her husband David in Austin, Texas, where she serves as the director of women's ministry at All Saints PCA and owns a team fitness and coaching company.

Excerpts from Kim Hall's open letter, which can be found in full on her blog:

Dear girls,

We have teenage sons, and so naturally there are quite a few pictures of you lovely ladies to wade through [on social media]. Wow – you sure took a bunch of selfies in your pajamas this summer!  Your bedrooms are so cute! Our eight-year-old daughter brought this to our attention, because with three older brothers who have rooms that smell like stinky cheese, she notices girly details like that.

I think the boys notice other things. For one, it appears that you are not wearing a bra.

I get it – you’re in your room, so you’re heading to bed, right? But then I can’t help but notice the red carpet pose, the extra-arched back, and the sultry pout. What’s up? None of these positions is one I naturally assume before sleep, this I know...

Those posts don’t reflect who you are! We think you are lovely and interesting, and usually very smart. But what are you trying to say?

And now – big bummer – we have to block your posts. Because, the reason we have these (sometimes awkward) family conversations around the table is that we care about our sons, just as we know your parents care about you...

In our house, there are no second chances, ladies. If you want to stay friendly with the Hall men, you’ll have to keep your clothes on, and your posts decent...

I know that sounds harsh and old-school, but that’s just the way it is under this roof for a while. We hope to raise men with a strong moral compass...

Every day I pray for the women my boys will love. I hope they will be drawn to real beauties, the kind of women who will leave them better people in the end. I also pray that my sons will be worthy of this kind of woman, that they will be patient – and act honorably – while they wait for her...

You are growing into a real beauty, inside and out. Act like her, speak like her, post like her.

I'm glad we're friends.

Mrs. Hall
