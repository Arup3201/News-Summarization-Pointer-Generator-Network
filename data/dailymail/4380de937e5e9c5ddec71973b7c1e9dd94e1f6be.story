Edward Snowden's father has said that he thinks his son will return to the United States so long as the Attorney General agrees not to detain him before his inevitable trial.

A clip of an interview with Lonnie Snowden aired on The Today Show Friday morning where the NSA leaker's father confirmed that he sent a list of demands to the Department of Justice that he feels will pave the way for his 30-year-old son to return from Russia.

The elder Snowden came up with the list with the help of his lawyer but with no consultation from Edward since the two have not spoken since April, two months before Snowden released classified intelligence documents.

Paternal support: Lonnie Snowden spoke with NBC and confirmed that he sent a letter to the Attorney General's office with a list of conditions he feels will allow Edward to return on his own accord

'At this point I don't believe he's committed treason,' Lonnie Snowden told NBC's Michael Isikoff.

'He has in fact broken U.S. law in the sense that he has released classified information and if folks want to classify him as a traitor- in fact he has betrayed his government but I don't believe he has betrayed the people of the United States.'

In his letter, Mr Snowden reportedly wrote that Edward was likely to come back to the United States on his own so long as the Justice Department agree not to subject him to a gag order, allow him to pick where his trial will take place, and make sure that he is not detained before said trial.

It seems unlikely that the federal government will meet the demands, as they have already filed a number of charges against Edward including several under the Espionage Act.

On the run: Edward Snowden is currently believed to be in a transit terminal of a Russian airport as he waits for asylum papers from Ecuador

During a press conference on Thursday in Senegal, President Obama said that he won't engage in any 'wheeling, dealing and trading' to get Edward extradited from Russia to the United States.

A spokesman for the U.S. Army has said that they have blocked access to The Guardian's website following their publication of leaked NSA documents.

Gordon Van Vleet, a spokesman for the Army Network Enterprise Technology Command, told The Monterey Herald on Thursday that they are filtering 'some access to press coverage and online content about the NSA leaks.'

'We make every effort to balance the need to preserve information access with operational security, however, there are strict policies and directives in place regarding protecting and handling classified information,' he wrote via email.

For their part, editors and reporters for The Guardian are publicly revelling in the ban. Writer Glenn Greenwald, who published the initial Snowden article on June 5, called the move 'flattering'.

'I'm not going to be scrambling jets to get to a 29-year-old hacker,' the president said of the whistleblower.

The younger Snowden, who turned 30 last week, fled to Hong Kong last month ahead of leaking details about an NSA surveillance program. He is now in the transit area of Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow.

The hacker's father has also cast some doubt on the intentions of WikiLeaks, the group who has come to the aide of Edward while he is in hiding.

'I love him. I would like to have the opportunity to communicate with him. I don't want to put him in peril, but I am concerned about those who surround him,' Lonnie Snowden told NBC.

'I think WikiLeaks, if you've looked 
at past history- their focus isn't necessarily the Constitution of the 
United States. It's simply to release as much information as possible 
and that alone is a concern for me.'

Snowden's
 future remains unclear, as Russian President Vladimir Putin has said 
that they have no plans to extradite him since there is no existing 
extradition treaty between the U.S. and Russia.

The former consultant is said to be seeking asylum in Ecuador but the process will take months to complete.

'It
 took us two months to make a decision in the case of Assange, so do not
 expect us to make a decision sooner this time,' Ecuadorean Foreign 
Minister Ricardo Patino told reporters.
