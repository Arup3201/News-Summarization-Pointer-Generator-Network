A shocked homeowner told today of the terrifying moment she almost plunged down an eight foot hole which appeared overnight outside her front door.

Monica Winton, 50, was popping to the shops when she nearly fell down the black hole into a mystery stream running underneath her house.

The tunnel carrying the stream has gradually collapsed and the hole above has expanded to several metres wide.

Frightening: Monica Winton was heading to the shops when she nearly plunged down the hole

Mrs Winton, from Perthshire, Scotland, fears the gaping chasm could soon engulf her entire front porch.

She said: 'It was extremely frightening. It happened on the Friday before Christmas and I was just going out to the shops when the path outside the front door suddenly gave way.

'I managed to stop myself falling and I was very fortunate not to have hurt myself.

'My husband went out and put a brush down the hole and couldn't believe how deep it was.

'If it had been the postman or one of us coming home in the dark it could have been a very very serious accident.

'We've just got to hope the porch doesn't collapse next.'

Mrs Winton, a home care officer at Perth and Kinross Council, who lives with husband Graham, 51, admitted she had no idea there was a burn running underneath their home of 11 years.

The couple have been told the tunnel 
carrying the water has burst underneath the property, which stripped 
away the soil above and subsequently brought down the pathway.

It is thought it happened due to the heavy rainfall that was experienced around the country in December.

Mr Winton said: 'The path is gone and the concrete pad the porch is on is floating on nothing so we're unable to use the front of the house.

'We had no idea there was a burn there and I've phoned the solicitor to check and there is nothing in the deeds about it.

'We've put sandbags down to keep the culvert open and we just have to hope for the best with the weather until it's sorted.

Unaware: The couple did not know there was a burn running underneath their home of 11 years

'I never thought something like this could happen.'

The insurance company are set to assess the damage before the weekend and Mr and Mrs Winton face an anxious wait to find out if they will be able to claim for the damage.

Mr Winton said: 'We're not sure which way to turn now and are waiting for the insurance company getting back to us.

'The insurance did say they would 
cover it but I had changed insurer at the start of December and it 
reverts back to the previous company because the claim came within eight
weeks of me changing.'

Location: The council has said the responsibility for the repairs lie with the affected property owners

A spokeswoman for Perth and Kinross Council said: 'The issue on Perth Road relates to the barrel drain running under properties on the street, which is in poor condition and collapsed in two locations in December.

'Due to the location of the collapses the responsibility of the repairs lies with the affected property owners.

'In the interests of public safety, council staff attended the two incidents to provide assistance if required.

'In addition we arranged for a camera survey of the barrel drain between the two collapsed sections on December 27, and we will provide the survey results to those affected once these are available, to provide the property owners with the information required for repairing damage.'

'We've put sandbags down to keep the culvert open and we just have to hope for the best'
