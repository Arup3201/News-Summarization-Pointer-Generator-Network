You've got the ball, you look up, see the same colour jersey you're wearing, and pass it that way.

What could go wrong? Well, for DeMar DeRozan, everything. The Toronto Raptors shooting guard accidentally gave the ball away by passing to Joakim Noah - who was stood by the bench.

Noah found it funny, receiving high fives from his team-mates and applauding the mistake, as questions were asked whether it was a clever ploy by the Chicago Bulls sub.

Noah afterwards reportedly said: 'I was wearing a white shirt so (DeRozan) thought I was a Raptor. Unfortunately, there’s nobody with a bun, long hair, beard on Raptors.'

The night got worse for DeRozan as the Raptors lost 116-103 against the Bulls.

Yet this game will be remembered more for DeRozan's mishap more than the defeat.
