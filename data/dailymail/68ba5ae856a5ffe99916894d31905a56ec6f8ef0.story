Facebook pioneer Sean Parker's extravagant wedding to Alexandra Lenas is in jeopardy after California planning officials launched an investigation into the elaborate construction for the nuptials.

The 33-year-old billionaire has been planning an extravagant ceremony based on HBO hit, Game Of Thrones, at the Ventana Inn & Spa in Big Sur on June 1.

However, the wedding - estimated to cost upwards of $10 million - is being investigated by Monterey County planners and the state Coastal Commission, the Carmel Pine Cone reported.

And today, a source admitted to MailOnline that because of all the fuss, Sean was 'considering various options.'

Getting hitched: Sean Parker, the founding president of Facebook, is marrying singer-songwriter Alexandra Lenas this summer

Brace yourselves: One observer said the wedding could turn into a 'Game of Thrones' fantasy re-enactment

Parker is marrying Alexandra, a 
singer and songwriter with whom he has a two-month-old daughter, Winter 
Victoria, after a two-year engagement.

He had 
reportedly hired a landscaping company to build fake ruins, waterfalls, 
bridges and a gated cottage in the surrounding woods at Ventana Inn in 
Big Sur, California.

And the wedding was meant to be no holds barred as the price tag for plants and flowers is believed to be $1 million, while a $350,000 dance floor is also being built.

The construction, however, appears to have drawn the ire of California Coastal Comission.

“We have opened a code enforcement investigation on Ventana Inn,” 
Monterey County planning director Mike Novo told the Pine Cone.

Neither the Ventana or Parker or his people have applied for permits, 
Novo said. One of the wedding’s contractors told county officials 
everything would be torn down after the wedding.

Associate county planner Joseph Sidor said the state coastal commission is investigating as well.

Parker, the founder of Napster, has hired “Lord of the Rings” costume designer Ngila Dickson to create outfits for the guests, he said on Facebook.

The New York Post reported that the save-the-date cards for the June 1 wedding look like wizard scrolls.

However, this week, a source told MailOnline that because of a string of leaks, the couple arenow 'strongly considering an alternate plan which would happen at
 a different location in pebble beach'.

And the source added today: 'Sean is considering various options.'

Playing dress-up: For Halloween, Parker dressed as Justin Timberlake, who played him in the movie 'The Social Network.' Lenas went as Britney Spears

In 2011, the pair dressed as victims from the Alfred Hitchcock film 'The Birds'

Game of Thrones is a popular Medieval fantasy TV show on HBO that features knights and dragons and sorcery.

Parker
 is worth an estimated $2billion after becoming the founder of Napster 
and other tech start-ups and working with Facebook creator Mark 
Zuckerberg during the early days of the social network.

He was portrayed in the 2008 movie 'The Social Network' by Justin Timberlake, though he has taken issue with how his character was portrayed.

Parker proposed to Lenas, a singer-songwriter, in February after she gave birth to the couple's daughter, Winter Victoria Parker.

The fantasy wedding won't be the first time the the couple has played dress-up together.

They have been pictured during previous Halloween parties dressed as Justin Timberlake and Brittney Spears and as a gruesome duo from the Alfred Hitchcock film 'The Birds.'

Meanwhile, this week it was revealed Sean and Alexandra are now living at the Plaza hotel in New York while their Greenwich Village townhouse is being renovated - and will be there for more than a year.

A spokesman for Sean declined to comment.
