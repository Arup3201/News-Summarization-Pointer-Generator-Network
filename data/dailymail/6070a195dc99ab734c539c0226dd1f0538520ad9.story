George Zimmerman's estranged wife has revealed that she now has doubts over her husband's innocence in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin last year.

Shellie Zimmerman, who said she has lost 40lbs since appearing with her husband in court, spoke out on Thursday in her first interview since a domestic dispute between the couple this month.

She told the Today show she was standing by her story that he had a gun during the altercation in Lake Mary, Florida two weeks ago because of how he touched his shirt - even though she never actually saw a firearm and police said they did not find one.

She added that she no longer feels like she can trust her husband or his version of events in the Trayvon Martin shooting after how he has treated her.

'I'm conflicted,' she said. 'I believe the evidence but this revelation in my life has helped me take the blinders off. I think anyone would doubt that innocence because I don't know the person I've been married to.'

Questions: Speaking on the Today show on Thursday, Shellie Zimmerman said she has doubts over her estranged husband's innocence in the killing of Trayvon Martin as she feels like she no longer knows him

She added: 'I have doubts but I also believe the evidence. I respect the jury's decision.'

Shellie, 26, spoke to Matt Lauer nearly three weeks after she frantically called 911 claiming her husband had his hand on a gun and was threatening to shoot her and her father in Lake Mary, Florida. She claimed that Zimmerman had punched her father and smashed her iPad.

But Zimmerman disputed the claims, instead blaming Shellie for starting the argument and hitting him with the iPad. Police responded to the scene but neither side pressed charges.

The dispute came days after she filed for divorce against her husband of more than six years, explaining that their marriage had been 'irretrievably broken'.

Speaking on the Today show, Shellie Zimmerman said she maintains he had a gun outside the house, even though police officers said they did not find any firearms.

'I absolutely stand by my story,' she said. 'I did not see a gun but I know my husband. I saw him in a stance and a look in his eyes that I've never seen before.

'He was putting his hand in his shirt saying, "Please step closer, please step closer". Logically I assumed he had a gun on him.'

She said she regrets not pressing charges
 but said she remains on probation and officers 'made it clear' that she
 would go to jail if charges were filed.

Shellie Zimmerman was sentenced to one year probation and 100 hours of community service after she pleaded guilty to lying to the court about the couple's finances during his bail hearing.

She added that despite this unwavering commitment to him, their relationship had changed throughout the murder trial because he treated her as if she was 'disposable'.

'I felt like I was living a life with 
him and that we were going to rebuild after this, but he had other 
plans,' she said on the show.

Doubts: She said she has doubts over her husband's innocence in the shooting of Trayvon Martin (pictured) in Florida last year because she no longer knows her husband. He was found not guilty

She said that she has so far been unable to serve him with the divorce papers as she does not know where he is.

Shellie, who told Lauer she has lost 40lbs since the trial, said she is now looking forward to moving on with her life, and now plans on always telling the truth in light of perjury charge.

'I'm a grown woman and I made a mistake and I own that,' she said. 'But the truth is the truth and I want to forever tell the truth.'

George Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder on July 15 in the death of the unarmed 17-year-old, who was shot in Sanford, Florida in February 2012.

Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch volunteer, had been accused of racially profiling the teenager, who was black. His wife told the Today show that, despite her doubts, she does not think Zimmerman pursued the teenager because of his race.
