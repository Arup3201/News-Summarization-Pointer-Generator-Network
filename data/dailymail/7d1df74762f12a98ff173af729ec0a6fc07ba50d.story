It was credited with fanning the flames of unrest across the Arab world as citizens took to the streets in protest and decades-old regimes fell.

It helped co-ordinate the Occupy movement that swept across the globe, and was blamed for playing a key part in last year's devastating riots in London.

But Twitter's role as the modern bastion of free speech is now at risk as the firm moves forward with an aggressive expansion strategy to grow from 100 million to 1 billion regular users.

Today the firm revealed it planned to censor messages on a country-by-country basis. Before, when Twitter erased a tweet it 
disappeared throughout the world.

Uprising: Twitter was credited with the change of regime in Egypt last year, where the site was used to co-ordinate protests

Now, a tweet containing content 
breaking a law in one country can be taken down there and still be seen 
elsewhere.

So people outside the country will be able to view what is 
being tweeted. But, crucially, groups within the state will not be
able to co-ordinate protests, as they did in the Arab Spring.

The plans have sparked 
fears Twitter will jump into bed with tyrannical governments to 'work 
with' on blocking 'offensive' messages in that country.

And they are a radical change for Twitter who, only 12 months ago, underscored its commitment to freedom of speech in a blog post.

Burning down: Twitter was also blamed, in part, for the co-ordination of the London 2011 riots. But, it was also used to track down several looters, who posted pictures of their ill-gotten gains online

Under the headline The Tweets Must Flow,
it said in January 2011 that, while it did not always agree with the 
things people choose to tweet, 'we must keep the information flowing 
irrespective of any view we may have about the content'.

The move is critical, said the San 
Francisco company, to broadening its audience by expanding into other 
countries and to ultimately making more money.

Twitter explained its policy change on its blog by saying:

'As we continue to grow internationally, we will enter countries that have different ideas about the contours of freedom of expression.

'Some differ so much from our ideas that we will not be able to exist there. Others are similar but, for historical or cultural reasons, restrict certain types of content, such as France or Germany, which ban pro-Nazi content.

'Until now, the only way we could take account of those countries’ limits was to remove content globally.

'Starting today, we give ourselves the ability to reactively withhold content from users in a specific country - while keeping it available in the rest of the world. We have also built in a way to communicate transparently to users when content is withheld, and why.

'We haven’t yet used this ability, but if and when we are required to withhold a Tweet in a specific country, we will attempt to let the user know, and we will clearly mark when the content has been withheld.'

'As part of that transparency, we’ve expanded our partnership with Chilling Effects to share this new page, http://chillingeffects.org/twitter, which makes it easier to find notices related to Twitter.'

But
it has sparked outrage across the world, with Twitter 
users themselves taking to the site to vent their anger. Many have 
signed an open letter demanding its cancellation.

But Twitter sees the censorship tool 
as a way to ensure individual tweets remain available to as many people 
as possible while it navigates a gauntlet of different laws around the 
world.

The blocking tool is designed to comply with local laws, such as bans on pro-Nazi content in Germany, it said.

Twitter will post a censorship notice whenever a tweet is removed. Any user, it is believed, will be able to report an offensive message. This obviously includes governments and big businesses.

It is a similar tactic to what search engine Google has been doing for several years when a law in a country where its service operates requires a search result to be removed.

Like Google, Twitter also plans to the share the removal requests it receives from governments, companies and individuals at the chillingeffects.org website.

The similarity to Google's policy is not coincidental. Twitter's general counsel is Alexander Macgillivray, who helped Google draw up its censorship policies while he was working at that company.

'One of our core values as a company is to defend and respect each user's voice,' Twitter wrote in a blog post yesterday.

'We try to keep content up wherever and whenever we can, and we will be transparent with users when we can't. The tweets must continue to flow.'

Twitter is tweaking its approach now that its nearly six-year-old service has established itself as one of the world's most powerful megaphones.

Daisy chains of tweets already have 
played instrumental roles in political protests throughout the world, 
most notably in the uprising that overthrew Egypt's government a year 
ago.

Gossip spread on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter would be exempt from any new regulations of the media, Lord Justice Leveson suggested yesterday.

The chairman of the inquiry into press standards had earlier said his recommendations would not just cover print but also news and entertainment websites.

He said concerns had been raised about showbusiness websites, which served to 'underline why the rules have to cover everybody' but suggested exceptions.

He said: 'I might see a distinction between Facebook where one person is communicating with friends or Twitter, and organisations in the business of selling themselves by reference to news or information.

'That's the difference between the pub chatter, and that which the state has an interest in seeing is conducted on a level playing field.'

It is a role that 
Twitter has embraced, but the company came up with the new filtering 
technology in recognition that it will likely be forced to censor more 
tweets as it pursues an ambitious agenda.

Reaching
the goal of one billion users will require expanding into more 
countries.

It will mean Twitter will be more likely to have to submit
to laws that run counter to the free-expression protections guaranteed 
under the First Amendment in the U.S.

If Twitter defies a law in a country where it has employees, those people could be arrested.

That is one reason Twitter is unlikely to try to enter China, where its service is currently blocked.

Google for several years agreed to censor its search results in China to gain better access to the country's vast population.

But it stopped that practice two years after engaging in a high-profile showdown with Chain's government.

Google now routes its Chinese search results through Hong Kong, where the censorship rules are less restrictive.

In a blog post yesterday Twitter said it had not yet used its ability to wipe out tweets in an individual country. All the tweets it has previously censored were wiped out throughout the world. Most of those included links to child pornography.
