Last week I told you about my trip to Bologna for Cosmoprof Worldwide - a giant international trade show for the professional beauty and cosmetics industry, with hundreds of exhibitors from all corners of the beauty world.

I was there with my nail polish range Binky London, but of course I took the opportunity to explore the huge arena and discover new and exciting beauty treatments and products.

While I was exploring the show, I ran into the stand of an American company called Make Up Designory (or MUD). They're based in Hollywood and run make-up schools throughout America and worldwide.

As well as this, they have a professional quality make-up line popular with make-up artists and beauty junkies like myself.

When I was offered the chance to get a MUD makeover, I obviously couldn't refuse! The make-up artist chose to recreate a Hollywood-style look on me that was natural yet super-glam. Here's how she did itâ€¦

MY MAKEOVER WITH MUD

Step 1 - Base

Binky said she adored the vibrant coral shade of her lips

The lovely MUD make-up artist started off by applying MUD's Face Primer across my face to provide a smooth base for the rest of my make-up.

Then, she applied their Cream Foundation to my skin using a small foundation brush. The product evened out my skin tone beautifully while providing a gorgeous sheer finish.

A great tip she told me was to test the colour of the foundation out on the neck, as opposed to the face, to ensure a perfect match.

Step 2 - Concealer

Next, she took a blue shade of their Corrector (cream concealer) and applied it gently to my eyelids as well as under my eyes. The blue tones work to neutralise any redness in those regions, evening out the skintone effectively.

Step 3 - Highlight and Contour

Of course, no Hollywood style makeover would be complete without some serious sculpting!

Using a small face brush, she applied MUD's Lemon Cream Highlighter on my chin, under my eyebrows and across my cheekbones to give me a subtle glow.

She then took a darker shade of their Cream Foundation to contour the hollows of my cheeks, as well as gently sweeping it across the top of my forehead near the hairline and across my jawline for added definition.

Step 4 - Loose Powder

To set my base, the make-up artist used various shades of MUD's Loose Powder to give the skin a three-dimensional, radiant look.

Using a fan brush, she first applied a very light shade in the area under my eyes, using only a very small amount so as not to counteract the glowy look of the base.

She then dusted a light layer of powder in my skintone all over the face, and finished by emphasising the contour on my cheekbones with a darker shade of the powder.

Using different shades of finishing powder on the face wasn't a trick I'd tried before, but it worked wonders in giving my skin a flawless finish.

Binky says that testing a foundation shade on your neck rather than your face can help find a better colour match for your skin tone

Step 5 - Eyes

She then pencilled in my eyebrows with a dark brown shade of MUD's Eye Color, gently blending in the colour using a small brush.

For my lids, she selected a gorgeous coppery shade of their Eye Color shadow called Spanish Gold, and applied it all over the lid, blending well.

She packed the colour onto the outer corners of my eyes - on both the upper and lower lash lines - to create a smouldering, smokey effect.

After this, she defined my eyes using MUD's Cake Eyeliner in a soft brown shade, applied with a damp brush.

Applying brown eyeliner close to the lash line helps make lashes look fuller, so she took her time to ensure she had filled every crevice between my lashes with the liner.

Finally she applied a touch of MUD's Volumising Mascara to give my eyelashes a flirty flutter.

Step 6 - Lips

For my lips, the make-up artist used a vibrant coral shade of MUD's Satin Lipstick called Lucky, applying it carefully with a small lip brush.

I absolutely adored the result, and certainly learnt some great make-up tips!

All the MUD products the make-up artist are available online at mudshop.com, but I've found some great alternatives you can buy here in the UK that will allow you to create a similar look
