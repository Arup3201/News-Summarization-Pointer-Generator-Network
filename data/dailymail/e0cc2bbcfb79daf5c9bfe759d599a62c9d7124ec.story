A quarter of us suffer from 'Sunday night insomnia' – and it's all down to our fears of starting a new working week.

Even commuting causes fretful nights, with 10 per cent of Britons too worried about their journey to work on Mondays to enjoy a proper night's rest, a study has found.

On average, Britons manage just six and a half hours' sleep a night, which is far less than the recommended eight hours. More than half only get four hours sleep or less.

The study, carried out by the Tune Hotels Group, reveals a nation suffering from a sleep deficit due to the anxieties about the start of a new working week. 

Jason Ellis, Professor of Sleep Science at Northumbria University, said: 'As a general rule, the average person needs around eight hours sleep a night to feel the full restorative benefits.

'This is particularly true of people who have very physically or mentally challenging jobs.

'"Sunday-somnia" is something I see a lot and it's important that people deal with the issues surrounding their sleep deprivation so that it doesn't have a knock on effect on sleep later in the week.'
