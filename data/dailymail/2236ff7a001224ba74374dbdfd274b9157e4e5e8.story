Whizzing past high-rise buildings and dodging in and out of traffic, this is one man's view of his commute home.

The exhilarating time-lapse video - filmed by cyclist Andrew Betsch - shows his view as he pedals through New York City.

The sped-up footage shows him riding through the wide thoroughfares and leafy boulevards of the frenetic, busy and crowded metropolis. 

Just another day in New York: Pedestrians waiting  to cross the cycling lane 

The faces of pedestrians are a blur in this stunning film of a bicycle journey from Midtown Manhattan to East Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

New Yorker Betsch's two-wheeled travels take him through apartment block towers and skyscrapers, and past pedestrians and residents, all in a matter of seven minutes.

The commuter sticks to the cycle lane, being careful to avoid pet-owners walking their dogs and the city’s residents, out on their daily chores.

Empty streets: The usually busy and frenetic city seems eerie and quiet during the bike ride

Tree-line avenues: The viewer gets a glimpse of the city's more normal, down-to-earth side

There is hardly any sign of people as Mr Betsch starts his trip but as time goes on in the video, the roads start to get busier as traffic builds.

It shows a different aspect to the metropolis, with the viewer getting a glimpse of the city’s more normal, down-to-earth side.

The fast-moving film lets the viewer feel almost like they are on a bike, experiencing every bump, jolt and incline on the road.

The accompanying soundtrack adds to the overall experience as energetic heavy metal music throbs throughout.

As the cyclist gets closer to his destination, the wide thoroughfares of Manhattan narrow into leafy, tree-lined boulevards.

The music goes down a notch, too and the vibe is gentle and less frenetic than before.

As time goes on, the roads are filled with New York’s famous yellow cabs and Mr Betsch rides more carefully, slowing down his pace.

Experienced rider: Betsch swerves in and out of traffic, beating the growing jam by turning into smaller streets

He has to stop for a swell of pedestrians at a zebra crossings and stops his bicycle for a little while to look at an iconic American fire engine which zooms by.

He swerves in and out of traffic, beating the growing jam by turning into smaller streets.

Flashing lights of a police speed past as Mr Betsch approaches a red bridge, filled with his fellow cyclists and pedestrians.

Soon he is riding his bike on Manhattan Bridge, the famous suspension bridge that crosses the East River, connecting Lower Manhattan with Brooklyn.

Getting closer to his destination, it’s surprising how few cars there are on the road. The city, which is known to be clogged with traffic, is hauntingly quiet, with very few vehicles.

He coasts his bike on roads which have started to widen again and the city takes on a more neighbourhood feel as Mr Betsch rides towards his front door.
