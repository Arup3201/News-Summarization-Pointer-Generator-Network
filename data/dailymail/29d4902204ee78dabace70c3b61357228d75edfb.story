Eliaquim Mangala is British football's most expensive defender ever, but the new Manchester City recruit was put through his paces in training on Tuesday, and may have realised the step up from the Portuguese League to the Premier League is bigger than he thought.

Signed for £32million from Porto, Mangala was pictured in his first training session at Carrington marking Sergio Aguero and Co.

Mangala, who had also been linked with Manchester United and Chelsea, becomes the second Porto player to join City this summer following Fernando’s £12m move to the Etihad.

City needed more numbers at centre-back after injuries to Vincent Kompany and Matija Nasatasic left them short last term. Joleon Lescott also left on a free transfer to West Brom.

Mangala, who is eligible to face Newcastle at St James' Park on Sunday, is expected to form a centre-back partnership with captain Kompany, but admitted the holiday period was 'too long' upon his arrival at City.

Mangala said: ‘I am happy now because I will be able to start a new adventure. I will be able to train again. It was good to be on holidays, but after a time I started to find the time quite long.

‘I went on a run every day and trained in the gym. Holidays are great but if the time is too long, it is difficult to come back. I think that I will need a bit of time but I will work hard in order to be 100 per cent as soon as possible.'

Mangala, 23, became City’s sixth signing of the summer after agreeing a five-year deal, and manager Manuel Pellegrini is confident that one of the most highly rated defenders in Europe will prove to be well worth the money.

Recruit: Mangala is the most expensive defender in British football history at £31.9million

‘I’m delighted to have added a player of Eliaquim’s quality in the squad,’ said Pellegrini, who saw his defence struggle in the 3-0 defeat by Arsenal in Sunday’s Community Shield.

‘He is already a fine player but in my opinion he has all the mental, physical, technical and tactical attributes to become one of Europe’s very best defenders.'

Record breaker: Eliaquim Mangala has finally signed for Manchester City for £32m

Rarely seen: Mangala, consoling Antoine Griezmann, did not play a minute at the World Cup

City tried to sign Mangala and Porto pal Fernando in January but it’s taken until the summer to seal deals. Why the delay? 

Everything seemed ready to go last month, but negotiations stalled because a private company owned 33 per cent of his economic rights. Porto only received £23m of the £31.9m fee with the rest said to have been paid to Doyen Sports Investments.

But isn’t he French? 

He was born in Paris but moved to Belgium at five, where he started as a striker. Standard Liege converted him to a defender and sold him to Porto for £6m. He is one of four Frenchmen at City, along with Bacary Sagna, Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy. Despite his fee he couldn’t get a game for France at the World Cup and was their fourth-choice centre back.

Didn’t United want him? 

And Chelsea. Asked about his preference in May, he said: ‘City or Chelsea? Chelsea because it’s London.’

How will he fit into City's backline?

Mangala has the tools — power, pace and composure — to be the ideal partner for Vincent Kompany.

And doesn't he still retain some of that striker's instinct?

He does - last season he scored three times in European competition (in the Champions League and Europa League). No defender netted more.

Didn’t UEFA cap City’s net spend this summer at £49m?

Yes, and they’ve spent £49.9m on Mangala, Fernando, Willy Caballero and Bruno Zuculini. Sagna was free and Frank Lampard is on loan. They got £10m from Sunderland for Jack Rodwell and £12m will follow when Javi Garcia joins Zenit St Petersburg.
