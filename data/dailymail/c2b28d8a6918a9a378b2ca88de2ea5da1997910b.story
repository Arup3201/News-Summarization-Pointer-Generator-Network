Surrogacy lawyer Stephen Page has slammed Australia's strict regulations as he told how his clients turn to Thai surrogates in desperation

The babies of desperate Australians who are using surrogate mothers in Thailand could end up being put into orphanages after Thai surrogacy laws changed this week, a lawyer has warned.

Australians using surrogates in Thailand could also be prosecuted for human trafficking under the new laws that ban surrogacy if the prospective parents aren't blood relatives.

Lawyer Stephen Page called the changes 'appalling' and said his clients have been left with no way to contact the pregnant woman carrying their babies, after the Thai military allegedly confiscated medical records from IVF clinics.

'I've been contacted by parents who can't contact the surrogate parents midway through pregnancy. They can't find out whether their baby or the mother is OK,' Mr Page told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's a disaster how the Thai government have announced it.

'These children didn't ask to born in this mess,' he explained.

Mr Page spoke out on the same day that it was revealed a Thai surrogate mother revealed she was forced to care for her six-month-old baby after an Australian couple refused to take him home once they found out he had Down syndrome.

The Australians had paid 21-year-old Pattharamon Janbua $11,700 to give them a baby but when she gave birth to twins - a boy and a girl - they only took the girl home to Australia.

Baby boy Gammy has a congenital heart condition and is critically unwell.

The Thai surrogate mother has received more than $182,000 in donations to care for Gammy after he was abandoned

Mr Page said all the Australian couples he'd met only seek overseas surrogacy as a last resort because Australian laws are so restrictive.

'The laws here makes it almost impossible. You can't advertise, you can't get an egg donor. Some people have waited seven years.'

He explained that parents who were unable to conceive naturally, cancer patients and gay couples came to him after all other avenues had been exhausted. They usually manage to have a child through a Thai surrogate within 18 months or two years. 

'Australians are the highest per-capita users of overseas commercial surrogacy, even though in three states it's a criminal offence,' he said.

Over 400 Australian children were born in Thailand between 2012-2013 and 600 were born in India.

'On a global scale that's a huge number. Now the Thai Government have said there won't be any overseas surrogacy allowed at all,' Mr Page explained.

He said this will cause more pressure on the Australian surrogacy system, plus parents will end up spending over $100,000 to get treatment in the United States or Canada.

It is cheaper to have a surrogate child in Thailand and India at around $80,000.

Mr Page said the changes in Thai law came after a story in the Bangkok Post about Chinese families using Thai clinics to chose the gender of their surrogate child, which outraged the world.

'Suddenly the Thai Government had a crackdown. They are fearing a loss of face because of that story and they want to be seen as tough,' Mr Page said.

The lawyer, who is based in Brisbane but works with Australians who are trying to have children from every state, said he wants the Australian government to take active steps with Thai authorities to make sure people who have signed contracts with pregnant surrogates can get their children back to Australia.

'What I would hate to see is these babies stuck in a Thai orphanage or people prosecuted for child trafficking offences for something that has been legal for years,' he added.

The Australian couple who have abandoned Gammy remain anonymous but they reportedly told Ms Janbua to have an abortion when they found out four-months into the pregnancy that one of the babies had Down syndrome.

'I would like to tell Thai women – don't get into this business as a surrogate. Don't just think only for money ... if something goes wrong no one will help us and the baby will be abandoned from society, then we have to take responsibility for that,' Ms Janbua said, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

The couple paid an extra $1673 when they first realised - three-months into the pregnancy - that Ms Janbua was having twins for them.

Ms Janbua is a Buddhist and thinks abortion is a 'sin'.

She originally agreed to become a surrogate mother because of her family's financial problems and the arrangement was set-up through an agency.

The Australian man and his ethnic-Asian wife could not conceive a baby themselves.

Ms Jambua, from a village in Chonburi province in northern Thailand, gave birth to Gammy and his twin sister in Bangok hospital.

However, when the babies were born the agent took the girl away and delivered her to the Australian couple who Ms Jambua has never met.

She never received the remaining $2341 that she was owed by the agent and is now struggling to keep her baby alive.

A Hope For Gammy campaign has been set up on Go Fund Me and has now smashed its $25,000 target after receiving more than $50,000.

The page pleads: '6 month old baby Gammy was born in Bangkok with down syndrome and a congenital heart condition. He was abandoned by his family and is being cared for by a young Thai woman who does not have the funds for his desperately needed medical treatment.

'Please make a donation so that he can have these operations and improve his quality of life. All monies raised will be kept in trust and will only be used for the care and wellbeing of Gammy.'

One doctor has donated $3,000 to the cause.

An administrator for the page wrote: 'Dr Pisit of ALL IVF has made a very generous donation after hearing about the Gammy Story. No ALL IVF Center staff have ever been involved in the Gammy case, but are touched by his situation and wanted to help. Thank you very much.'

Gammy's tragic story has caused outrage on Twitter.

Richard Long wrote: 'Takes a bit to make me angry but this story does. what greedy, selfish people.'

Another user, @ChickkinOz, said 'these people need to be financially responsible for this child and woman for life. Unbelievable, how are they parents.'

While @BCmanutddesi called it 'OUTRAGEOUS!!

'This story just makes my blood boil!!,' @parentingfiles said. 

Australians aren't the only people that travel to Thailand for surrogacy reasons.

Earlier his year, there were 65 babies stuck in Thailand that were conceived by gay Israeli couples and birthed by surrogate Thai women, the Times of Israel said.

The claims were made by the Facebook group 'Help Us Bring the Babies Home.'

The babies were allegedly unable to be brought to Israel because the Interior Ministry Gideon Sa'ar has not granted Israeli citizenship to the infants.

Commercial surrogacy is banned in Australia and it is illegal for people living in Queensland, NSW and the ACT to undertake commercial surrogacy in Thailand. It's also illegal for Australians to select a baby's sex.

Current Australian Medicare policy forbids Medicare rebates for IVF use for surrogacy and to receive surrogacy as a treatment option in Australia the following conditions must be fulfilled:

Many Australians have flocked to Thailand over the years because the rules were far less strict. However, the rules have changed this week.

After Thailand’s military government reviewed 12 Thai IVF clinics involved in surrogacy cases they have announced new laws.  

Surrogacy is now only recognised in Thailand if:

Surrogacy in Thailand is illegal if:

These new laws will now exclude almost every Australian from pursuing surrogacy in Thailand.
