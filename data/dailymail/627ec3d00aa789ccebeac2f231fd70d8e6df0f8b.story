Famous for the restaurant chain popular with A-list celebrities, Nobu has revealed its first European hotel is to open in London in 2016.

The five-storey, 156-room Nobu Hotel Shoreditch, which is still under construction, will boast an angular glass design, with concrete balconies and steel beams.

A restaurant – over three stories – will be the hub of the resort, showcasing a menu developed by Chef Nobu Matsuhisa exclusively for the hotel.

As well as London, Nobu Hospitality has also announced an expansion plan with hotels in Miami, Manila to Chicago and Riyadh.

Additionally, the hotel will feature banqueting and meeting rooms, a fitness centre, and a private garden.

‘The demonstration of beauty, drama and instinctive elegance has found a perfect home with the Nobu Hotel Shoreditch.’

The first Nobu Hotel opened in 2013 as a boutique hotel within Caesars Palace Las Vegas and was subsequently named one of the Hottest New Hotels of 2013.

The hotel opened on Valentine's Day last year, with 181 rooms featuring simple, natural designs inspired by cherry blossoms, origami and Japanese Zen gardens.

‘We have worked hard to create meaningful luxury experiences,’ said Struan McKenzie, chief operating officer Nobu Hospitality.
