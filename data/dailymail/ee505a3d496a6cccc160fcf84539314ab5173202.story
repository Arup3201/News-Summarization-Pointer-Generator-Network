This is the astonishing moment a grandmother cheats death when she is struck by an out-of-control taxi and flung ten yards along the pavement.

Mirtes de Oliveira Podesta, 64, was preparing to cross the road when the taxi driver smashes into another car and spins into her path at the end of a 24-hour shift without any sleep.

CCTV pictures show the elderly woman being wiped out by the speeding cab in Maringa, Parana, south Brazil.

But she has astonished doctors by escaping with only fractures to her arms and legs.

Split seconds from danger: Pensioner Mirtes de Oliveira Podesta prepares to cross the road in Brazil when a taxi driven by a man at the end of a 24-hour shift crashes into another car (top left) before spinning towards her

Helpless: The collision between the two cars sends the taxi careering into the 64-year-old's path

Recovering in her hospital bed after Tuesday's crash, the pensioner said: 'All I remember is that I was being very careful about crossing the street.

'I stopped at the zebra crossing and the lights changed for me to go across. I just can't figure out how this happened to me, but I am amazed that I am still alive.'

The doctor who attended the elderly victim said the car hit the left side of her body.

'The impact was mainly distributed between the arms and legs and luckily did not damage her spine and head,' Dr Denilson Dalleffe explained.

'Nothing in my medical training can explain how she survived. The trauma to her body was huge. It is a miracle and she will make a full recovery in six months,' he added.

How did she survive? Remarkably, the grandmother suffered only fractures to her arms and legs in the crash

The taxi driver, Elton Rafael Garcia, 22, who hit Podesta, admitted to police that he had been working for 24 hours without sleep. He started driving cabs two months ago. 

He said he didn’t remember how the accident happened but confessed he was in a ‘state of drowsiness’.

'I’d been working through the night and was in a state of drowsiness. I think I must have fallen asleep. The next thing I remember was waking up when the airbag blew up in my face,' said Garcia.

The cabbie dislocated his knee and 
suffered minor injuries to his chest and arms in the accident. He later 
posted a photo on a social networking site laughing and boasting how he 
had got off lightly.

Shock: The driver of the other vehicle involved in the collision was a 70-year-old grandfather taking his grandchildren of eight and 11 years (pictured) to school

'I wrote off my car but this is all that happened to me!'  he said showing his injured arm.

He was immediately condemned by the pensioner’s family who filed a complaint to the police and said they now intend to sue him for the accident and for the emotional distress caused by the distasteful joke.

'It just demonstrates that this driver is not ready to be behind a wheel as he has behaved completely irresponsibly by putting the photo on the internet,' said detective Luiz Carlos Barroso.

The driver of the other vehicle involved 
in the collision was a 70-year-old grandfather taking his grandchildren 
of eight and 11 years to school.

'I'm amazed I am still alive': Mirtes de Oliveira Podesta speaks to the media from her hospital bed

'I was driving at about 30mph, which I normally do because of the children,' recalls Pascoal Pussi.

'It was quiet on the road. As I edged through the junction this speeding taxi came out of nowhere. I’ve never experienced anything like it. I just remember hearing a big bang.

'I don’t even know how I’m alive. If it had happened seconds later, the taxi would have hit me squarely on my door and I’m sure me and the children would not have survived,' he said.

All three had minor injuries and were taken to hospital but have since been released.
