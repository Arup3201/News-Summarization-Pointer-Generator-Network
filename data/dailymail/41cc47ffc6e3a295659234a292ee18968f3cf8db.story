JFK Airport is looking for a few brave contractors willing to get close to potential Ebola patients for screenings at the airport, and who are willing to take the job for just $19 an hour.

The staff will be hired by Angel Staffing Inc. who are looking for candidates with EMT or paramedic training.

The lucky hires will help Customs and Border Protection officers and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention workers identify potential Ebola cases at Terminal 4.

JFK Airport is looking for a few brave contractors (not pictured) willing to get close to potential Ebola patients for screenings at the airport, and who are willing to take the job for just $19 an hour

Screeners will need to get so close they even take the possible patient's temperature.

Paramedics will be paid $20 per hour, but The New York Post notes that EMTs will only earn $19 per hour.  

Washington Dulles, Newark Liberty, Chicago O'Hare, and Hartsfied-Jackson Atlanta international airports are all hiring screening staff.

Facebook user Jaclyn Namer was cautious about the job in a comment under the posting.

'Wow, that's really scary...Be safe everybody' she wrote.

Others were less worried.

'I can help on weekends in Chicago,' wrote one Jeremy Voris on the same thread.

Federal health officials say the entry screenings that start on Thursday add another layer of protection to halt the spread of the Ebola virus that has killed thousands.

Screeners will use no-touch thermometers to try to find passengers with fevers.

Using infrared temperature guns, staff are checking for elevated temperatures among passengers whose journeys began or included a stop in one of the three African countries.

Customs officials reported about 150 people travel daily from or through Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea to the U.S.

Nearly 95 per cent of these travelers land first at one of those five airports.

Those countries have seen most of the deaths from the outbreak, which has claimed more than 4,000 lives.

However Republican Representative Tim Murphy said today during a congressional hearing on Ebola that the screening processes are flawed because people can mask symptoms with Ibuprofen or simply avoid the airports which have installed screenings.

The screenings are being conducted by the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP), under direction of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Customs officials reported about 150 people travel daily from or through Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea to the U.S.

CBP staff will identify passengers to screen by looking at trip information and checking passports.

On Monday, CDC director Dr Tom Frieden reported that 91 passengers at JFK were pinpointed as having a risk of being infected with Ebola.

No passenger was found to have a fever but five were sent for further evaluation.

Ebola patient Thomas Duncan landed in Dallas on September 20 after traveling from his home in Monrovia, Liberia. He also traveled through Brussels Airport in Belgium and Washington-Dulles.

The 42-year-old Liberian national was not contagious while he traveled.

Mr Duncan died last Wednesday after being treated at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital.
