Eight members of a drug-trafficking gang which flooded the north of England with £25million worth of cocaine have been jailed for a total of 121 years.

The men adopted code names inspired by Stanley Kubrick’s cult war film Full Metal Jacket to smuggle drugs from Mexico into Yorkshire.

Senior gang member Paul Robinson was 
known as 'Colonel' in recognition of his role, while accomplice Frank 
Babar used the pseudonym 'G-man' and 45-year-old Richard Stead was 
nicknamed 'Ten Seconds'.

Nicknames: Richard Stead, left, known as Ten Seconds - a reference to the film Full Metal Jacket - was jailed for 21 years for conspiracy to supply drugs, Brent Padgett, right, was jailed for 16 years

The gang renamed Sheffield 'Saigon', 
Manchester was 'Hollywood', and Sheffield's Ecclesall Road - where the 
gang met to discuss deals and pick up deliveries of cocaine - was dubbed
'The Strip'.

Prosecutor David Brooke told a six-week trial at Sheffield Crown Court: 'They’ve been both clever and incredibly stupid to use these nicknames as they gave police a very good idea of the part each member played.'

Detectives used surveillance, 
bugging devices and intelligence to foil the activities of the gang, 
which was turning over between £400,000 and £500,000 every month at its 
height.

The men imported up
to 200kg of cocaine from Mexico over a period of two years, concealed 
in the hydraulic arms of scissor lifts.

Full Metal Jacket: Michael Dyson, left, 41, was jailed for 18 years after admitting conspiracy to import and supply drugs, and Joseph Fawcett, right, 26, was jailed for 12 years after admitting conspiracy to supply

Police discovered parts for several lifts at an industrial unit in Battersea, London, and another unit at the Wharncliffe Business Park in Barnsley, where they also found a dust mask contaminated with cocaine.

The gang was captured after South Yorkshire Police launched a huge investigation in August 2011 involving several other forces, the Serious and Organised Crime Agency and foreign law enforcement agencies.

They tailed suspect Carl Carlton in his car to a layby in Rawmarsh, near Rotherham, where he picked up half a kilo of cocaine with a street value of £40,000.

After Carlton was arrested police seized his phones and began tracing the rest of the gang, who were dealing in 80 per cent pure cocaine.

The pair involved in the exchange were acting for Stead and Robinson.

Code names and pseudonyms: The gang referred to Sheffield's Ecclesall Road - where they would meet to discuss drug deals - as 'The Strip'

The real deal: The actual Strip, in gamblers' paradise Las Vegas, is slightly more glamorous than the gang's South Yorkshire meeting spot

Several members of the gang lived 
luxury lifestyles, the court heard. One defendant, Michael Dyson, had to
be repatriated from the Netherlands for the trial.

Stead
brought kilos of cocaine, MCat and Class B drugs into South Yorkshire. 
He was secretly taped talking about selling drugs and the cost of 
barrels of cutting agents used to dilute cocaine.

Stead, of Wilthorpe, Barnsley was found guilty after trial of conspiracy to supply cocaine and MCat and was jailed for 21 years.

Seven other gang members were also sent to prison.

'Stupid': Police said the gang had been 'incredibly stupid' to use nicknames inspired by the film, as they gave detectives an indication of the role played by each member

Michael Dyson, 41, of the Netherlands and Paul Robinson, 35, of Shafton, Barnsley were each jailed for 18 years after admitting conspiracy to import and supply cocaine and other drugs.

Brent Padgett, 30, of Barnburgh, Doncaster admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine and other drugs and was jailed for 16 years.

Four other men were jailed for 12 years each after admitting conspiracy to supply cocaine and other drugs. They were: Tristan Clarke, 28, of Sheffield, Joseph Fawcett, 26, of Sheffield, Anthony Urban, 35, of High Wycombe and Frazer Guest, 35, of Chesterfield.

Babar, 48, of Richmond, London will be sentenced later after being convicted of conspiracy to import cocaine and concealing criminal property.

The court heard he bought a tennis equipment company from ex-Wimbledon champion Pat Cash and a Dragon’s Den entrepreneur Richard Farleigh whom he knew through playing chess. He denied it was a front for his criminal activities.

Another defendant, Marco Russo, 41, of Streatham, London was cleared of conspiracy to import cocaine.

Kubrick’s violent 1987 film follows a platoon of U.S. Marines during the Vietnam War.
