A deputy care home manager 'waved her breasts in the face of an 88-year-old dementia sufferer' before hauling him out of his chair, biting him between the legs and calling him a 'dirty old man', a court heard.

Siobhan Koralewski, 30, was 'taking revenge' on pensioner Ken Pinkney for breaking her mother Margaret's shoulder while agitated, it has been claimed.

During her time at Roundstone Care Residential Home in Filey, North Yorkshire, Koralewski also allegedly forced another dementia sufferer, Elizabeth Hall, to down a cocktail of the dregs of her daily tea, Teesside Crown Court heard.

When Ms Hall screamed she did not want to drink the concoction, Koralewski put a hand over her mouth and told her to 'shut up' before pulling a 'wedgie' on her to force her to move, the jury was told today.

Koralewski and her 67-year-old mother both deny four counts of ill-treating four residents at the now-closed care home between June and November 2012.

Former care worker Jennifer Price took to the witness stand today to describe how she arrived in the care home's dining room at 9am on July 17, 2012, to witness the attack on Mr Pinkney.

Ms Price told the court: 'When Siobhan was dancing around in front of him she took her top off. She had a vest top on underneath.

'She said "Do you like that you dirty old man?". She was waving her breasts around in his face.

'Siobhan pulled Mr Pinkney out of his chair by the legs. She sat on top of his stomach, holding his arms down, and started bouncing up and down on his tummy.'

The court heard Mr Pinkney was screaming for his daughter and trying to get up and lash out while Margaret did nothing to stop what was going on.

Ms Price said: 'Siobhan moved down a bit and bit him and he screamed. She bit him between the legs at the top. She got off him to answer the phone.'

Koralewski and her 67-year-old mother Margaret (pictured to the front), are both accused of mistreating four dementia patients at the care home. They deny the charges and the trial at Teesside Crown Court continues

Former care worker Jennifer Price (pictured outside court with Siobhan Koralewski's brother Jeremy) took to the witness stand today to describe how she saw the attack on Mr Pinkney unfold at 9am on July 17, 2012

She also saw Siobhan slap Mr Pinkney three or four times across the face, she told the court.

'It was loud enough to make a sound but not leave a mark,' she added.

Siobhan then 'roughly' put Mr Pinkney in the passenger seat of her car and drove him to Cross Lane Psychiatric Hospital in Scarborough.

'When she got back she told me she had fastened his seatbelt really tight and had the window open all the way there so he got cold,' Ms Price said.

Ms Price told the jury she would also see Siobhan preparing mixtures of leftover drinks for Ms Hall, 59, who suffered from Downs Syndrome, learning difficulties and dementia.

She said: 'She was making a drink of all the drinks Liz had left - three or four drinks of tea she would not drink during the day.

'Liz was crying because she did not want to drink her drinks. Siobhan put her hand over her mouth and said "shut up".

'Siobhan then did what she often did to get Elizabeth to move - held onto the belt of her trousers and pulled them up.

'She was like "wedgie-ing" them so they had no option but to walk up the stairs. Elizabeth was screaming,' Ms Price added.

Koralewski, 30, and her mother Margaret, 67, both deny four counts of ill-treating four residents at the now-closed care home between June and November 2012. The trial at Teesside Crown Court (pictured) continues

In another alleged incident, when dealing with stroke victim Harold Waller, 91, who was supposed to be guided patiently along on his zimmer frame, Siobhan walked with him 'with her knee driving him forward while she held him up,' Ms Price claimed.

'He used to be shaking and worried about falling,' she added.

Earlier Siobhan's brother Jeremy, who is also Ms Price's partner, told the court his sister 'hated her job'.

He added: 'She couldn't handle the stress. She shouted a lot at everybody. She had no managerial skills. She had no people skills.

'She is not stupid. She just hasn't got patience.

'Elizabeth Hall used to hide in her bedroom and ask 'Is Siobhan here today?' if she was, she would not come out.'

The trial continues.
