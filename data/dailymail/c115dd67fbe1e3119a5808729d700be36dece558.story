Plain cigarette packaging has been credited for recent falling smoking rates

Plain cigarette packaging is being hailed as a 'vaccine' in the fight against cancer with Australia setting an example around the world.

The introduction of the plain packets is being credited as the reason behind a recent sharp drop in smoking rates.

Simon Chapman, a professor in public health at the University of Sydney said: 'It's almost like finding a vaccine that works very well against lung cancer,' reported the Sydney Morning Herald.

According to the National Drugs Strategy Household Survery, the biggest and longest-running Australian survey on drug statistics, daily smoking rates have tumbled from 15.1 per cent to 12.8 per cent from 2010 to 2013.

The statistics also reveal the age people smoke a cigarette for the first time has risen from 14 in 2010, to 16 presently and that 95 per cent of 12 to 17 year olds have tried a cigarette.

Despite recent claims made by tobacco companies that plain-packaging was responsible for driving cigarette sales due to a price war, health experts have been quick to label the survey's findings as proof plain-packaging works in the battle against smoking.

Professor Chapman said Australia was leading the way, with other countries around the world set to follow our example by introducing the plain-packaging in the future.

Health experts have labeled plain-packaging a lung cancer vaccine after a national survey found daily smoking rates fell from 15.1 to 12.8 per cent between 2010 and 2013 

'It's that big. This will give enormous momentum to the international push for plain-packaging right around the world,' he said.

New Zealand, Britain and Ireland have plain-packaging legislation before parliament while France and India are considering following suit.

Prior to the introduction of a 12.5 per cent tobacco tax, close to 24,000 people participated in the survey from July to December last year.

Professor Chapman said it was critical the survey was completed before the tax was implemented due to the 'influence' this has on smoking rates.

'The only thing that happened in the 12 months before that was the introduction of plain-packaging laws,' he said.

As part of a broader trend, smoking rates have fallen by 50 per cent since 1991. Other countries including New Zealand, Britain and Ireland are following Australia's lead, with plain-packaging legislation before parliament

Australian Council on Smoking and Health president Mike Daube said the results were the best he had seen in 40-year  health policy career.

Mr Daube said it was likely that target of 10 per cent adult smoking rates by 2018, set by the National Preventative Health Taskforce in 2009, could be beaten.

He added the once rates are below 10 per cent, as smoking becomes an increasingly unacceptable behaviour, there would be an even more rapid decline.

Crediting plain-packaging as a major influence on smoking rates in the last two to three years, Mr Daube said tax increases, media campaigns and a bipartisan view on tackling the issue have also played a combined role.

Geoff Neideck of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, which completes the survey every two to three years, said the findings were part of a broader trend where smoking rates have fallen by 50 per cent since 1991.

But Mr Neideck said plain-packaging laws should be seen in the context of changing attitudes and cultural practices.

Since 2000, the cost of an average packet of cigarettes has steadily increased.
