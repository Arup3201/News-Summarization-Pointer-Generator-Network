A Missouri couple has filed for bankruptcy just eight years after winning a $20 million lawsuit against the makers of a butter popcorn flavoring that gave one of them lung disease.

Eric Peoples of Carthage and his wife, Cassandra, sued International Flavors and Fragrances Inc. and Bush Boake Allen Inc. in 2004 after Mr Peoples developed bronchiolitis obliterans while working at a popcorn plant in Jasper.

But just eight years later, the two are being forced to sell the home they built for $3.9 million to pay off creditors, after their financial situation went spectacularly downhill.

According to the Joplin Globe, the Peoples listed the current value of their residence and 10.5 acres of land at just $700,000 and personal property assets of nearly $33,000.

But their liabilities are listed at more than $611,000, including a $482,876 mortgage with U.S. Bank.

The couple's case against the butter flavouring companies was the first of several brought by workers and their spouses.

The suit claimed Mr Peoples, who has two children with his wife, developed
the lung disease after being exposed to diacetyl, a 
chemical present in the flavouring to give a buttery taste and aroma.

Researchers
have found that, when heated, the chemical produces a toxic, 
potentially lethal gas, and can leave those exposed with a shortness of 
breath, a dry cough and wheezing.

At the trial, doctors testified that Eric Peoples would eventually need a double-lung transplant.

A Jasper County jury awarded Eric Peoples $18 million and his wife $2 million.

It has never been revealed exactly how much of that verdict money the couple received.

Mr Peoples said at the time that his 
attorney's firm would take 35 per cent of the pay out, and their 
attorney, Ken McClain, suggested a portion would be spread among other 
workers involved in the lawsuits.

Though it is not clear how they spent
the remaining millions, purchases include two Honda automobiles, a
Chrysler PT Cruiser and a Kawasaki Mule.

Other personal property listed in 
court documents include a bedroom set, dryer, end tables, china, lamps, a
VCR, a microwave oven and $50 worth of camera equipment, ABC reported.

Since winning the lawsuit, Cassandra 
Peoples has also been employed by Smith Midwest
Realty as a realtor. Social networking sites also indicate she helps run PJ's Country Bakery in Joplin, Missouri.

But among the unsecured claims the couple list in their bankruptcy petition is a November 1, 2011, judgment in Jasper County Circuit Court to Jeff Neely, the contractor who built their home over a five-year period.

He sued them in August 2011, claiming they still owed him $107,147.

The couple failed to respond to the lawsuit in a timely manner, and a judge granted Mr Neely a default judgment at an annual interest rate of 9 per cent.

The couple filed a motion last December asking the judge to set aside the default judgment because of difficulties, including a downturn in Mr Peoples' health.

Their motion also asserted a basis for a counterclaim against Mr Neely because they said the house initially was estimated to cost $400,000, but skyrocketed to more than $3.9 million.

Neither the Peoples' motion nor the bankruptcy petition explains the $3.2 million difference between what they claimed to have paid to build the home and what they say the property is worth now.

Popcorn lung, also known as bronchiolitis obliterans, may be caused by inhalation of airborne diacetyl, a chemical used to produce the butter-like flavoring in microwaveable popcorn.

When the chemical is heated, it produces a toxic, potentially fatal gas, researchers believe.

The non-reversible disease affects the bronchioles - small airway branches in the lungs - which become narrowed by scar tissue and inflammation. It causes dry cough, shortness of breath and wheezing, and can lead to the need for lung transplants.

It first came to public attention when eight former employees of the Gilster-Mary Lee popcorn plant in Jasper, Missouri, developed bronchiolitis obliterans in the late 1990s.

In 2000, the Missouri Department of Health called in The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to make a determination of the cause, and to recommend safety measures.

After surveying the plant and each patient's medical history, NIOSH recommended respiratory protection for all workers in microwave popcorn production

In September, a court awarded Wayne Watson, 59, from Denver, Colorado $7.2 million after he developed the condition from eating three packs of the snack each day.

Jurors agreed that the popcorn manufacturer and the supermarket chain that sold it were negligent by failing to warn on labels that the butter flavoring, diacetyl, was dangerous.
