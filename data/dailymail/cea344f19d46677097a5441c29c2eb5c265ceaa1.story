Roma needed two late goals from Adem Ljajic to deny plucky Sassuolo an historic victory in a Serie A match at the Stadio Olimpico.

The Giallorossi rested talismanic captain Francesco Totti with Wednesday's crucial Champions League showdown with Manchester City in mind and the capital club missed his leadership as Sassuolo snaffled two early goals in the 2-2 draw.

Simone Zaza scored both, first capitalising on Morgan de Sanctis' goalkeeping gaffe and then beating the Roma stopper from a close encounter only minutes later.

Daniele De Rossi's dismissal shortly after the break spelled doom for Roma but they rallied to cut the deficit through a Ljajic penalty 12 minutes from time.

As the seconds ticked away, the Serbian rifled a last-gasp leveller before Sassuolo defender Sime Vrsaljko saw red to rub salt in the visitors' wounds.

Given the fact leaders Juventus were held to a goalless draw by Fiorentina on Friday night, an opportunity to close the gap to a single point passed Roma by, and they remain three points off the pace.
