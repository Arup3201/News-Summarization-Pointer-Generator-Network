Pope Francis yesterday moved a British woman closer to sainthood for the second time in less than a month.

He formally declared that Mother Mary Veronica of the Passion, a little-known Carmelite nun, had lived a life of ‘heroic virtue’.

His decree opens the way for the search for two miracles first to declare her ‘Blessed’ and finally to canonise her as a saint.

Born Sophie Leeves, Mother Mary Veronica founded the Sisters of the Apostolic Carmel, a religious congregation of Carmelite nuns based in India.

She was born in 1823 in Constantinople to the Rev. Henry Daniel Leeves, an Anglican chaplain to the British Embassy there, and Marina Haultain, the daughter of a Colonel in British Army.

But when she was a teenager she felt drawn to the Roman Catholic Church and she converted at the age of 27 during a visit to Malta in 1850.

She became a nun the following year and in 1863 accepted a teaching post in Kozhikode in India and she went on to found her own teaching order five years later.

In 1892 the order was formally affiliated with the Discalced Carmelite Order and today it has branches in India, Sri Lanka, Kuwait, Pakistan, Kenya, Rome and Bahrain.

Mother Veronica died on 16 November 1906 at the age of 83 and her cause was opened at the request of her order in 1997.

The progress of her cause to sainthood came just a month after Pope Francis also recognised the heroic virtues of Frances Taylor, a nurse who tended dying soldiers alongside Florence Nightingale in the Crimean War.

Frances, the youngest of 10 children of an Anglican vicar from Lincolnshire, was 22 when she volunteered to join the Lady of the Lamp in Scutari, Turkey, in 1854 when Britain was at war with Russia.

She was deeply impressed by the faith of the dying Irish soldiers she was caring for and she became a Catholic while serving in the field.

She established a religious order – the Poor Servants of the Mother of God – which under her direction opened refuges for prostitutes and homeless women and children in London before spreading throughout Europe.

As Mother Magdalen Taylor, Frances also founded the Providence Free Hospital in St Helens, Lancashire, and she took over the running of St Joseph’s Asylum in Dublin.

She died in her convent in Soho Square in 1900 after falling ill en route to Rome and she is buried at Roehampton, south west London, after establishing 20 institutions in her own lifetime. 

Today her order continues to work particularly with the poor, the elderly and the disabled.

The last British women to be declared as saints were Anne Line, Margaret Ward and Margaret Clitherow, who were among the 40 English and Welsh Martyrs of the Protestant Reformation canonised by Pope Paul VI in 1970.

Other British women who are being considered for sainthood include Elizabeth Prout, a 19th century Passionist nun who worked in the slums of Manchester; Mary Potter, a Londoner who founded an order of nursing nuns in Nottingham in the same period, and Margaret Sinclair, a 20th century Scottish nun who died of tuberculosis after tending to the poor of Edinburgh.

The Vatican is also studying the sainthood causes of London-born Mother Riccarda Beauchamp Hambrough, a Bridgettine nun who helped to hide about 60 Jews from the Nazis in her Rome convent during the Second World War, and Mother Katherine Flanagan, also a London-born Bridgettine.
