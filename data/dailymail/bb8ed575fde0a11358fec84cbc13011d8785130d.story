Graham Gooch is on the outside now, but you wouldn't necessarily realise it. Discarded as England batting coach a few weeks ago, he still talks with the passion and wisdom of a man who cares deeply - and knows no other way. 

When a figure of his stature says that English cricket needs to shed its conservatism and 'look at the way we're going to win games', it's both polite to listen and almost counter-intuitive to reflect that he's no longer involved.

Gooch had been passing on his knowledge to the England dressing-room since late 2009 before he received a call from Alastair Cook at the end of April informing him that his services were no longer required.

Focused: England captain Alastair Cook decided on different approach following Ashes whitewash

Before that he was a selector. And before that he was England captain. He remains their leading Test run scorer, with a tally of 8,900. Quite simply, an England dressing-room without Gooch feels like Lord's without Old Father Time.

'It was always going to come to an end some time,' he told Sportsmail. 'I'll be in and around the game, but just not so much hands on. I'll be not so involved with the actual thing I've been involved with all my life.' 

The clamour for change after England's winter horror show was always more likely to focus on the batsmen than the bowlers. In 10 innings during the Ashes whitewash, they passed 300 only twice and failed to reach even 180 on six occasions. 

Something had to give - and, eventually, that something was Gooch.

'When you're getting bowled out in 50 overs, and the side are back in the field quickly, there's a price to pay,' he said. 'That's the reality. We know that. It's fair enough.

'Peter Moores and Alastair are quite entitled to make the changes. Alastair has had tough decisions to make. In a way that's good for him because that's what he had to do. He can't stand on sentiment.

'Would I like to have left in that way? No. It was absolutely not in my plan to be sacked by England. But I wish them and Alastair all the best. He's been a good friend, and we've had a very good relationship down the years. It was going to come to an end, obviously, at some stage - probably just a fraction prematurely from my point of view. But these things happen. It doesn't mean you don't care about them and want them to do well.' 

Chief among Gooch's hopes for England's new era - an era which begins with Cook's leadership skills squarely under the microscope after the 5-0 hammering in Australia - is a bolder approach.

'I was brought up under the captaincy of Keith Fletcher and Mike Brearley to play the pressing game,' he said. 'As a leader you have to try to make things happen. 

'I was never schooled in letting the game unfold and seeing if you come out on top. You've got to take the initiative. You've got to press.'

Is that something Cook should have picked up after going head to head against Australia captain Michael Clarke during the back-to-back Ashes series? 

'We have to look at the way we're going to win games,' said Gooch. 'You have to create the opportunity to win, and fight for it. You've got to push the game forward. That's the only way to play cricket.' 

Gooch, who was speaking at a Chance to Shine event in south London, believes that philosophy should extend to selection. 

England's 12-man squad for next week's first Test against Sri Lanka at Lord's was named on Thursday, and there was no room for Jos Buttler whose 74-ball 121 in the one-day series last week prompted many to push him for a Test debut.

The selectors went instead for the tried and tested Matt Prior. And, while Gooch agrees with that choice, he had encouraging words for Buttler.

'I would not rule him out as a future keeper,' he said. 'Not that guys like James Foster or Chris Read would let you down at all. We've been too conservative. England have to be bolder.'

But it's hard to imagine that Gooch will be watching anyone more closely than Cook, his old protégé both at Essex and England, and a disciple of Gooch's near-religious emphasis on the importance of the daddy hundred - scores of 150 or more.

'I've seen him meet and conquer many challenges over the years,' he said. 'But he's in an interesting position now where he's got to kick on. You can' t have more of the same. He's got to take these exciting young players forward.

'He'll need his experienced players to help be leaders in the dressing-room as well. You can't just have one captain. But he's also got to be the guy who sets the tone and demands more from the players. He's entitled to demand more. You're playing for your country. It's the ultimate. You're entitled to demand more to get the best out of them - that's part of the job as captain.' 

Half an hour with Gooch is enough to convince you that cricket will never leave his bloodstream. Lord's next week will feel like someone is missing.

Chance to Shine ambassador Graham Gooch was visiting Sacred Heart Primary School in Battersea for Yorkshire Tea National Cricket Week. This week thousands of Chance to Shine schools all over the country are enjoying cricket-themed activities in the classroom and playground.
