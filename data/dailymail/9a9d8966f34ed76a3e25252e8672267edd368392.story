Exit strategy: Education Secretary Michael Gove said he would vote for Britain to leave Europe if there was a referendum tomorrow

Michael Gove and Philip Hammond 
yesterday became the first Cabinet ministers to say publicly that they 
would vote for Britain to leave the EU.

Government sources said at least seven of their senior colleagues agreed privately.

Mr Gove said life outside the EU ‘would be perfectly tolerable’. Mr Hammond, when asked if he would vote to leave if significant powers cannot be reclaimed, replied: ‘Yes.’

The revelations will pile pressure on David Cameron to make clear that he would lead an ‘Out’ campaign if he does not secure a major change in Britain’s relationship with Brussels.

If he cannot negotiate a new deal, Chris Grayling, Iain Duncan Smith, Owen Paterson, Justine Greening, Francis Maude, Theresa Villiers and Oliver Letwin would all reportedly favour an EU exit.

Some Tories are calling for another, earlier referendum seeking a mandate to claw back powers from Brussels, held on the same day as next year’s European elections.

Mr Cameron’s inner circle is concerned that, instead of taking a clear stance on Europe and putting pressure on Labour, the Prime Minister’s pledge to hold an in/out referendum in 2017 – after negotiating looser ties – has prompted Eurosceptics to push harder.

Some have tabled an amendment to the Queen’s Speech that could be put to a vote tomorrow, lamenting the lack of any legislation in this Parliament guaranteeing a referendum in the next one.

They argue that even though such a Bill would have little chance of being passed by the Commons, voters would be reassured that Mr Cameron meant what he said.

Mr Gove said yesterday that he and other ministers would abstain in this week’s vote – but added that Tory backbenchers and ministerial aides would be free to vote in favour, a process he described as ‘letting off steam’.

Under pressure: Prime Minister David Cameron faces a Cabinet revolt over a European referendum

Downing Street had briefly 
contemplated giving Cabinet ministers free rein to join around 100 
Eurosceptic MPs and back the amendment – but the potential government 
rebellion was deemed too much to bear.

Leaving the EU would not be 'cataclysmic' for Britain, Boris Johnson insists as Tories increase pressure on Cameron

Asked whether he thought 
Britain should leave the EU if there were a referendum today, Mr Gove 
told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘Yes, I’m not happy with our position 
in the European Union. But my preference is for a change in Britain’s 
relationship with the European Union.

‘My ideal is what the majority of the British public’s ideal is, which is to recognise the current situation is no good, to say that life outside would be perfectly tolerable, we could contemplate it, there would be certain advantages.

'But the best deal for Europe, and for Britain, would be if 
Britain were to lead the change that Europe needs.’

‘My own view 
is, let the Prime Minister lay out our negotiating strategy, make sure 
he has a majority – which I am convinced he will secure at the next 
election – and let’s have the referendum then.'

Mr Gove, touted as a
potential successor to Mr Cameron, dismissed Labour’s claims that 
allowing Tory MPs to back the Queen’s Speech motion showed the party was
in turmoil, claiming: ‘You can’t have a civil war when everyone is on 
the same side.’

However, he admitted that ‘some of my colleagues 
want to let off steam’. After Mr Gove’s interview, Mr Hammond, asked on 
the BBC’s Pienaar’s Politics radio programme whether he would vote to 
leave the EU as things stand, replied: ‘Yes, because I believe that we 
have to negotiate a better solution that works better for Britain if we 
are going to stay in and play a part in the European Union in the 
future.

‘But let me be absolutely clear: I think it is defeatist to sort of say we want to leave the European Union.

Support: Home Secretary Theresa May and Defence Secretary Phillip Hammond said they would abstain

‘We’re going to try and change the rules and change the way it works and change the objectives that it has in order to make it something that works for Britain.’

However, he added: ‘If the choice is between an EU exactly as it is today and not being a part of that then I have to say that I’m on the side of the argument that Michael Gove has put forward.’ 

Eurosceptic former Defence Secretary Liam Fox said he 
would support the Queen’s Speech amendment, adding that the biggest 
problem was ‘letting Labour off the hook, because it’s quite clear the 
Labour party have no intentions of giving the British people a say on 
this most fundamental issue’.

In his Daily Telegraph column, Boris Johnson said he supported legislation backing a referendum – but warned colleagues that Britain’s problems will not be solved by simply leaving the EU.

'If we left the EU, we would end this sterile debate, and we would have to recognise that most of our problems are not caused by "Bwussels", but by chronic British short-termism, inadequate management, sloth, low skills, a culture of easy gratification and underinvestment in both human and physical capital and infrastructure,' he wrote.
