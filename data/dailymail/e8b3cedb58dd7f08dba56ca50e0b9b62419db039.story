Paris Saint-Germain defender Serge Aurier has apologised for his comments about referee Bjorn Kuipers after his side's Champions League clash with Chelsea.

Aurier, currently out injured, is the subject of UEFA disciplinary action after posting a video on Facebook in which he labelled the Dutch official a 'dirty son of a b***h' in response to the dismissal of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

He will learn his fate on Thursday and showed remorse for his outburst in a series of posts on his Twitter account.

'I beg the pardon of Mr Kuipers, his assistants and all match officials for my reaction after the match at Chelsea,' Aurier wrote.

'My team-mates and myself are working to reinforce the image of Paris and France in European football. This negative image is obviously not what we want to send out.

'My passion for football and my frustration at being injured for such a match led to my reaction, which had no place in football.

'The job of the referees is not easy and I am sorry.'

Ibrahimovic himself is facing a disciplinary hearing with the French league, also on Thursday, after aiming derogatory comments at Lionel Jaffredo as he left the field following PSG's 3-2 defeat to Bordeaux on Sunday.

Marseille's Dimitri Payet could also face sanctions after another video, captured by Canal+, showed the France playmaker aiming expletives at the closed door of the match officials' dressing room following Sunday's goalless draw with Lyon.
