A trembling Kerry Kennedy talked of her 'Daddy' as she took the stand in the third day of her drugged driving trial in Upstate New York today.

The daughter of Senator Robert F. Kennedy testified about her childhood and her father's assassination, with her defense playing the Bobby card in an attempt to pull the heartstrings of the White Plains courthouse judge and six-person jury.

'My mother raised us because my father died when I was 8,' she said on the stand in response to a question from her lawyer, before adding, 'He was killed when he was running for president.'

Referring to him as 'Daddy,' Kennedy went on to explain how her father 'was 
attorney general during the civil rights movement and then a senator,' the New York Daily News reported. Her frail mother, Ethel, was present in the courtroom.

Later in her testimony, Kennedy said she had 'no memory' of the moments leading up to her 2012 drug-induced crash.

She said her day was planned like any other on July 13 -- gym, then work. And as she drove down the winding road from her Bedford mansion she said she recalled 'thinking how beautiful the light was filtering through the trees.'

But then everything went blank she said.

'Then I have no memory,' Kennedy told jurors. 'I have no memory from going on (Interstate) 684 until my car was at a stop on Route 22.'

The testimony came as the lawyer defending Kennedy against the drugged-driving charge told reporters the prosecution's witnesses were helping, rather than hindering, his client's case. 

Kennedy was charged after her Lexus swerved into a tractor-trailer on an interstate highway in 2012.

Blood tests detected a sleeping drug, and she said she accidentally took an Ambien instead of her daily thyroid pill.

Earlier Wednesday, Kennedy's lawyer paraded out numerous character witnesses, leading State Supreme Court Justice Robert Neary to exclaim that it was becoming almost tedious.

According to the New York Post,
 Larry Cox, director of the human rights organization KAIROS, and a 
longtime friend called her 'one of the most highly respected humans 
rights leaders extant today.'

He
 was followed by Alexander Lopez, who worked as Kennedy's persoanl 
assistant at the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights, 
and called his former boss 'an outstanding citizen' who was honest and 
had no issue with sobriety.

After Emily Liebert, a magazine editor
 and close friend of Kennedy's, echoed those remarks, the weary judge 
broke in: 'I think we're beyond the scope of character witness, I don't 
want to say tedious, but beyond the scope.'

On
 Tuesday, the prosecution's toxicology expert said she doesn't know 
whether Kennedy would have realized she was driving erratically after 
taking the sleeping pill.

That seemed to undercut the prosecution's claim that Kennedy should have pulled over as she felt the drug's effects.  

The
 testimony came from Elizabeth Spratt, director of toxicology at the 
Westchester County Department of Laboratories and Research.

Defense attorney William Aronwald asked Spratt if impairment after taking the Ambien ingredient zolpidem is 'often not recognizable' by the driver. Spratt said, 'Yes.'

Then he asked if Spratt could say Kennedy's impairment 'was in fact recognizable by her.'

'I don't know if she was aware,' Spratt said. However, she would not go so far as to agree that Kennedy definitely felt no effects.

Spratt also acknowledged the possibility 
of 'sleep driving,' which she defined as, 'You're driving without being 
aware that you're driving.'

She said the drug's effects include 
sleepiness, poor motor coordination and headaches. It can also cause 
amnesia, meaning that many people don't remember much after they've 
taken Ambien, she said.

Spratt testified on the second day of Kennedy's trial. The prosecution rested right after her testimony, and the defense immediately moved for a dismissal, saying no evidence of a crime had been presented. Justice Robert Neary denied the motion.

The defense case opened with two character witnesses. The Rev. Gerard Creegan, a family friend, said he's known Kennedy since 1975 and had been to Kennedy family gatherings including 'weekends at the Cape.'

He said Kennedy had helped him with human rights work in the Dominican Republic and was 'very honest' and 'very sober.'

Kennedy's younger sister Rory Kennedy,
 a documentary filmmaker, then took the stand and said the 54-year-old 'has a stellar reputation for honesty.' She said she also 
has 'a reputation for sobriety and general healthy living.'

Ethel Kennedy, 85, was wheeled into the court there to support her daughter.

Outside court Tuesday, it was suggested to defense attorney Gerald Lefcourt that prosecution testimony was going his way.

'I think so, too,' he said. 'I hope the jury will agree.'

New
 York state trooper Bradley Molloy told the White Plains courtroom on 
Tuesday that he initially thought Kennedy may have suffered a seizure or
 stroke.

She passed several
 drug tests that he administered at the police station. The tests 
included having Kennedy follow the tip of a pen with her eyes, stand on 
one leg and touch the tip of her finger to her nose, Molloy said.

Kennedy
 told the trooper that she had consumed some carrots and a cappuccino 
that morning and had slept about eight hours the night before. 

Molloy
 said Kennedy also told him she was concerned that she might have 
accidentally taken a sleeping pill instead of her thyroid medication, 
which were next to each other on her medicine cabinet.

'The defendant was not impaired by any drug,' Molloy said. 'I feel she may have suffered a medical condition while driving.'

Molloy said Kennedy was polite and 
cooperative throughout the ordeal but she said to him that she had an 
unspecified 'brain injury' the year before the accident that may have 
contributed.

On Monday, a 
North Castle town police officer, Joel Thomas, said he had administered 
four field sobriety tests, involving eye movements, walking and turning,
 reciting part of the alphabet and standing on one leg.

Kennedy only passed one, reciting the alphabet from J to T, he said.

Also Monday, motorists testified that Kennedy swerved her Lexus into a 
truck, damaging the car and blowing a tire, but kept driving and later 
was slumped at her steering wheel and disoriented.

In
 his opening statement, defense lawyer Gerald Lefcourt said Kennedy was 
not disputing that she drove erratically but she maintains that it was 
an accident.

Prosecutor Stefanie DeNise said even if the pill were taken accidentally, Kennedy violated the law 'by failing to stop and pull over as she felt the onset of symptoms.'

Though Kennedy has no history of drunken or drugged driving, she isn't the first one in her family to face the charge. Her cousin Patrick Kennedy, who resigned as a Congressman from Rhode Island in 2011, was found to have traces of the same sleeping medication in his system when he drove his Mustang into a Capitol Hill barricade in 2006.
