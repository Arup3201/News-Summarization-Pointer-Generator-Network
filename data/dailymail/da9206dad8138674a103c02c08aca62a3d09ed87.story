Samsung Galaxy Note: The new S3 has a bigger screen, closer to the mid-sized Note tablet/phone. It will also have a quad-core processor when it launches in April, say several reports

Samsung's Galaxy S3 will go on sale in April - and will launch in the UK first as part of a tie-in with the Olympics this year.

The hi-tech handset is the follow-up to one of the most 
iconic Android smartphones and is liable to a heavyweight competitor for Apple's iPhones.

The launch details were revealed by ZDNet Korea, who confirmed them with the electronics giant's worldwide marketing agency.

The phone will have a quad-core Exynos processor - a chip similar to the ones in high-powered laptops and PCs.

It will also have a 4.8-inch HD display - bigger than its predecessor.

The details tie in with earlier leaks
about the S3's release date. Samsung's official line is that it will be available in 
the first half of this year.

'The successor to the Galaxy S2 smartphone will be unveiled at a Samsung-hosted event in the first half of 
the year, close to commercial availability of the product,' said the 
Korean electronics giant in a statement.

If
Apple launches iPhone 5 this summer, as expected, the S3 is liable to 
be among its most heavyweight competitors in the second half of this 
year.

Samsung's
Galaxy series are traditionally used to showcase the most hi-tech 
components manufactured in Samsung's factories - and have been ahead of 
the components in Apple's iPhone.

Samsung recently launched the Galaxy S Advance - a cheaper model of the hit handset with slightly less cutting-edge components. It's available now

The new S3 handset's screen size is closer to Samsung's Galaxy Note

The Galaxy S2 came out last August and quickly became a cult handset. Twenty million S2s have sold at last count.

The Galaxy S3's spec has not been officially announced, but according to reports, here's what it might include...

The Galaxy S2 was one
of the first handsets with a laptop-esque dual core processor, and 
offered an eight megapixel camera months before Apple's iPhone 4S.

Samsung still makes several components that are used in Apple's iPhones.

Samsung's Galaxy S2 sold 20 million units at last 
count.

One in 10 of the whole Korean population owns an S2, and the phone  is still a cult favourite on tech sites.

The S2 helped propel Samsung's smartphone sales past Apple's in the 
third quarter of 2011. 

'Samsung’s Galaxy lineup has been one of the most sought after smartphone lines worldwide,' says Boy Genius Report.

'There is no question that consumers are 
interested in the Galaxy.'
