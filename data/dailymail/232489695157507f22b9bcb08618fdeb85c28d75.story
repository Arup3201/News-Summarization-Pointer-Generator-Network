Family and friends have paid their final respects to a Utah woman, her two children and her mother, less than a week after they were shot dead in a tragic murder suicide.

Framed pictures and mementos of Kelly Boren, 32, her children, Joshua 'Jaden' and Haley, and her mother, Marie King, 55, lined the front of the Lindquist Mortuary Chapel in Layton, which was filled with people mourning the lives tragically cut short.

Police say the four were murdered last Thursday by Kelly Boren's police officer husband, Josh Boren, 34, the father of her children, who then turned the gun on himself.

Tears flowed during the emotional service, in which Jaden, 7, was remembered for his boisterous energy and loving hugs, and his sister Haley, 5, was thought of for her love of dress ups and ability to pose for the camera.

Authorities still don't have a firm motive for the shocking act, though they have learned that the couple had recently separated after having marital problems.

The service lasted more than an hour, and in a nearby overflow room, four coffins stood decorated with flowers, Deseret News reported.

King's brother, Nigel McIntosh, described their family as close and one that enjoyed taking camping trips together as children.

He recalled how his sister 'loved a night out,' and rebelled at school.

'She didn't like being told what to do,' he said with a laugh.

McIntosh said in recent years she had become a 'very proud Nana,' regularly sharing pictures of her grandkids.

Kelly Boren was remembered as a 
kindhearted person who always took care of others, whether it was her 
parents or her children, until the day she died.

When her mother was struck down with cancer at a young age, Kelly grew up quick, taking on the responsibility of caring for her.

An aunt, Tracy Miller, recalled how Kelly loved planning family holidays, and a recent vacation to southern California over Christmas was their best ever, she said.

'She was so full of life and wanted to experience it all,' Miller recalled.

Jaden's second-grade teacher told the congregation about the time the class took a field trip by train to Salt Lake City.

'To keep the train going, he and some boys decided to jog in place all the way to Salt Lake,' she said.

Haley was remembered as being a 'sassy little treasure who could wrap men and boys around her finger,' Miller said. 'She was a girl's girl from the start.

'Both kids had their mom totally 
wrapped around their fingers,' she said, sobbing. 'Kelly and the kids 
had a remarkable bond. Kelly and the kids were such amazing, wonderful 
people.'

Cheryl King spoke of her stepdaughter's kind nature.

Horror: Authorities believe Josh Boren killed his wife, Kelly and their two children, Jaden and Haley, and his mother-in-law before taking his own life. Friends have now said Kelly was going to file for divorce

Killed: Marie King, 55, pictured,Boren's mother-in-law, was found dead in a separate bedroom

'We haven't even thought how we'll move forward,' she said. 'We'll figure it out as we go along.'

She also thanked Josh Boren's family, who attended the funeral, for reaching out since the shooting.

'We can only imagine the depth of your sorrow,' she said. 'You are an incredible family and in our hearts.'

A funeral service for Josh Boren was scheduled for today in Spanish Fork.

The family were remembered after it was revealed Kelly Boren texted a friend to say she couldn't stand her husband's rage just hours before the tragedy.

According to the Salt Lake Tribune, Kelly feared her husband and told a friend she was about to file for divorce after ongoing problems in their marriage.

One of her fitness workout partners, 
RiRi Whiting, had helped persuade Kelly to separate from Josh a few 
months before the killings.

That day, Kelly
 sent Whiting a text saying she had decided to get a divorce and 
couldn't stand her husband's rage anymore, Whiting told the Tribune.

Whiting asked her what she meant and Kelly said she would explain later that night at the gym - but she never showed up.

The separation was nothing new, another
 friend, Stacy Archuleta said, explaining that in 2010, Josh had slept 
on the couch for six months as Kelly considered divorcing him.

Archuleta said 'many other people in our community knew of these problems, and none of us dared to go to anybody.'

She added that Kelly had told her she was unhappy and felt unsafe, but urged her friend not to tell anyone in case it affected chances of reconciliation, the Tribune reported.

'I wish I would have said something back then,' Archuleta said. 'I was afraid I would upset her.'

Police have said they were never 
called to the home over the four years the family living in Spanish 
Fork, but Kelly told her friends her husband was abusive.

But the couple had been going to events together and had a counseling session planned for the week of their deaths.

Earlier this week, Kelly's father spoke out about the murder-suicide, calling it 'unimaginable.'

Jeff King said two Davis County sheriffs rang his doorbell to give him the shocking news.

'Police
 show up at your door in the early hours and tell you your only child is
 dead, your grandchildren are dead, your ex-wife is dead and the 
son-in-law you trusted and counted on to look after your child is...' 
the Layton man said Monday.

'You look for understanding, and there is none,' King told Deseret News. 'You can't describe how you're feeling. ...They were my whole world.'

Boren's colleagues became concerned at around 11 p.m. Thursday when the officer didn't show up for work as scheduled at 10 p.m.

They went to check on him and spotted blood and shell casings on the carpet through the window of the family's home.

After officers entered the house, they discovered 'a large quantity of blood on the stairway leading to the second floor of the residence.'

Marie King was found dead in one upstairs bedroom. The bodies of Kelly Boren, Josh Boren and their children were in another.
