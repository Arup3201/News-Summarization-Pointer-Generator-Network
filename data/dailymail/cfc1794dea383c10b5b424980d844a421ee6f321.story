Rare algae that turned the waters at Sydney's beaches an unsettling shade of red has been found to have an altogether more picturesque effect by night - when it glows fluorescent blue.

Several popular beaches around the Australian city - including iconic surfers' mecca Bondi - were closed this week due to health fears when the enormous algae bloom left swathes of the seawater blood red.

These pictures, taken just before daybreak at Stanwell Park beach, reveal the spectacular effect created by the algae, dubbed sea sparkle, when darkness falls.

The natural phenomenon is caused when the tiny organisms flourish in one area.

The appearance of the algae, called Nocturnal Scintillans, or sea sparkle, drove swimmers from the waters around the coast this week.

While the algae has no toxic effects, it is potentially high in ammonia which can lead to rashes and other skin irritations.

Despite the warnings many swimmers were spotted venturing into the crimson waters, choosing to ignore its off-putting appearance - and odour.

Local lifeguard Bruce Hopkins said of the algae: 'It has quite a fishy smell to it.

'It makes the surface look like it has a coating of tomato sauce coloured oil.'
