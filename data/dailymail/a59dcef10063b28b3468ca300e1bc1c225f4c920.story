Ruth Shirey, who taught at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, died after being assaulted in her home on Friday allegedly by her own son

A 36-year-old man has been taken into custody after he allegedly fatally attacked his retired university professor mother. 

Ruth Shirey, who taught at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, died after being assaulted in her home on Friday morning. Ms Shirey died at a local hospital.

She was found in the bathroom of her home with head and facial injuries. 

A 911 call was made at 3am on Friday from a man who told the dispatcher that a woman was injured at the home. 

Her son, Todd Walters was found at her home in Indiana, Pennsylvania and taken into custody. 

Walters is charged with criminal homicide and aggravated assault.

Her neighbor, Dan Broadbent, told WTAE: 'She was a very, very nice lady. She was a retired geography professor from IUP and just very active in the community and politics. She was a very, very good lady.

'That's very startling because we had never heard any violence or any domestic disturbances from that house, that area, in a long, long time. It's very disturbing.'

According to reports, Walters would stay at the home from time to time.

The professor's ex-husband, Royce Walters, was interviewed by police following her death and said that his son had psychological problems and was off his medication.

Mr Walters said the last time he saw his son he threatened to punch him. 

University staff were informed of Ms Shirey's death on Friday morning. 

Her university biography lists her many academic successes. She obtained a Ph.D in geography in 1970 from the University of Tennessee before joining Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 1970. 

In 1988, she participated in a Fulbright faculty exchange with the University of Poona in India.

She had authored several books and many articles, along with winning numerous awards for excellence in the geography field.
