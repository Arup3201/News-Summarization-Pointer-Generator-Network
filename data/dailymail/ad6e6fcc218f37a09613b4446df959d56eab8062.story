An arsonist who tried to burn down his own grocery store ended up buried under rubble when the building exploded due to the build up of petrol fumes, police claim.

Chadi Jomaa, 36, broke both his legs, injured his pelvis and neck and received burns to his face and neck. He was dragged clear by nine policemen who had to be treated for burns and smoke inhalation.

The occupant of the flat above the store, in Sydney, Australia, was blown clean out of the building by the force of the blast, landing on the footpath below.

Blast: The building explodes as a result of the build up of petrol fumes inside

Dramatic CCTV footage of the incident shows a man, who police claim is Jomaa, lingering around the front of the store shortly before the explosion.

He is believed to have doused the premises with 10 litres of petrol which he had bought from a nearby petrol station earlier in the day.

After the building explodes and collapses, police and firefighters are seen racing inside to drag in to drag Jomaa out of danger.

Syris Persia, the occupant of the flat above, was asleep when the building exploded. He is seen stumbling out of the smoke and rubble before collapsing onto the ground. Yesterday he was being treated in hospital for back injures.

Local Police Association president Scott Weber said the officers who rescued Jomaa had braved searing heat and flames to rescue the stricken man.

He told the Australian Daily Telegraph: 'These are true police heroes, we are proud of them.

'When they heard the screams of a victim trapped they totally disregarded their own safety and went for the safety of those people trapped. That's what makes these police officers someone that we are all proud of.

'They put themselves in harm's way, we run into situations when everyone else runs out and I'm just glad no police officers were seriously injured.'

Sniffer dogs reportedly detected traces of petrol at the scene and Jomaa was charged with destroying property with intent to endanger life.

He was refused bail at a hospital bedside hearing as is due to appear in court on October 17.
