The Scot leading the global fight against doping has warned Glasgow 2014 competitors to beware the danger of supplements — as testers adopt a ‘no excuses’ policy.

Sir Craig Reedie, president of the World Anti-Doping Agency, remains frustrated by athletes continuing to put their faith in unregulated nutritional shakes and mixes.

A dodgy supplement is often cited when a positive test is produced, with Team Scotland cyclist Bruce Croall recently serving a six-month ban – despite authorities ruling that he hadn’t deliberately tried to cheat – as a result of a contaminated product.

Watch out: Sir Craig Reedie has warned athletes against taking unapproved supplements

Former British Olympic Association chairman Reedie told Sportsmail: ‘I can understand why athletes take these things, because they will do anything to get an edge and improve their performance. But it is extremely dangerous.

‘I mean, there is a clearly an issue at the moment with supplements. The supplements business the world over is almost entirely unregulated.

‘It’s important to get control of what people put in these things, because athletes will keep taking supplements. Very experienced athletes take them – and, in many ways, they shouldn’t. If they must take them, they have to make sure that what they’re taking is absolutely clear.

‘There was a case of a German athlete in Sochi, someone who had been to two Olympic Games, should know exactly what she was doing. But one of her friends said: “Oh, you should take this supplement.” So she did.

‘I mean, it’s that kind of occasional weakness that can cause a real problem. If they are determined to take supplements, they should know that they’re clean.

Croall blow: Cyclist Bruce Croall was banned for six months despite his offence being ruled an accident

‘The new world-wide code coming into place next year will deal rather more accurately with what you would describe as minor offences. But basically the principle of strict liability still applies.’

UK Anti-Doping will run the testing programme in Glasgow and, during the run-in to the Games, they’re delivering a mandatory education programme to all Home Nations teams.

Nicola Newman, UKAD’s director of communications and education, told Sportsmail: ‘Our two aims are never to get a positive test at a major event from a British athlete and to stop a serious doper from competing. That’s our goal, although we can’t guarantee it.

‘”No excuses” is another phrase for us. We don’t want anybody to feel they lacked the knowledge they needed. We’re working really hard with federations and sports to make sure they all understand the risks.

‘The on-going message that we’re giving to these athletes is predominantly around not making a mistake or getting a positive test because they didn’t understand.’

Every athlete selected to compete at the Games, as well as more than 200 coaches, must sign up to UKAD’s education programme, the largest the organisation has ever run, to try to ensure they do not make an innocent mistake by taking an illegal supplement or medication.

Competitors have been told there are ‘no guarantees at all’ if they buy products online and have been advised to check every supplement with the Informed-Sport programme, which batch-tests products for banned substances.

UKAD have even run mock urine-testing sessions for athletes less familiar with the rigours of drug-testing, such as members of the lawn bowls teams, to ensure British athletes are given as much information as possible ahead of the Games.

Newman said: ‘We worked with some of these sports in Delhi (the last Commonwealth Games, in 2010). Some of them were incredibly nervous about the implications of providing a sample so we ran mock testing with them. We showed them exactly what happens. It’s not necessarily normal but it’s definitely necessary.

‘A lot of athletes going (to Glasgow) won’t have been to a major event before or have needed to fully understand all of the rules around medication and supplements, in and out of competition.

‘But this is non-negotiable. It’s mandatory for all athletes, as well as sports personnel who all have to do an online course, and it’s the first time it’s happened in the UK.’
