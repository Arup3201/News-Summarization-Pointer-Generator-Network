For generations of children, they were as strongly associated with school as weekly spelling tests, times tables and freezing cold showers after PE.

Now the company which for 140 years has been making the custom woven nametapes diligently sewn by parents into each piece of school uniform, has gone into administration.

Cash’s, Coventry’s oldest remaining weaving business, is now desperately seeking a buyer after its product apparently fell out of favour with a new generation of parents.

School's out: Cash's, the company which for 140 years has been making the custom woven nametapes diligently sewn by parents into each piece of school uniform, has gone into administration

Since 1870, Cash’s has been made the name tapes, available in several primary colours and several styles of handwriting.

But now parents who cannot be bothered to sew nametapes into their children’s school uniform appear to have sounded the death knell for the firm.

The woven nametape appears to have been replaced by a waterproof pen which parents use to scribble their child’s name on the label of their uniform - if parents can be bothered even to do that.

Fran Daly, who worked at Cash’s in the 1960s and 70s, told the BBC: ‘It was a delightful place to work. Everyone got on really well.

‘It is a shame. It was a wonderful British family company, but I’m not surprised.

‘Cash’s was the best quality but it was a lot of work and expensive so difficult for them to compete with name pens and stickers that can be made much cheaper.’

Siobhan Freegard, from the parenting website NetMums, said: ‘I think the advent of the waterproof pen which costs about 20p at the checkout of all school uniform shops was the problem. It is like a magic wand.’

The mother-of-three says she feels ‘hugely impressed’ by any child who comes to play with her children if she spots a woven nametape sewn into their uniform.

Mrs Freegard said: ‘It is like a sign that says: ‘Perfect Mum.’

Last night, the joint administrator Will Wright, a partner at the accountants KPMG, said: ‘I really hope that this is not the end of the road for the business.’

He is hopeful of finding a buyer for Cash’s, which was still making around 9,000 nametapes last week, he said.

Mr Wright said: ‘There is interest out there. We are hopeful.’

The majority of the 58 people employed at the Coventry factory have been made redundant while KPMG desperately searches for a buyer for the business.

Cash’s began in 1846 when it was England’s leading silk ribbon manufacturer, diversifying into woven name tapes in 1870.

It was set up by two Quaker brokers, John and Joseph Cash, but no member of the family is still involved in the company.

In 1964, it was appointed ‘Manufacturers of Woven Name Tapes to Her Majesty the Queen.’
