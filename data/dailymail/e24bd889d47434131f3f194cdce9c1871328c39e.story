Eugenie Bouchard has come a long way - very fast - from winning a junior Wimbledon title two years ago while staying at the home of Laura Robson.

Her meteoric rise, which has continued apace since the start of the year, when she was ranked 32, now sees her achieving a first final appearance in only the sixth Grand Slam she has entered.

The 20-year-old Canadian, named after a British princess, is one match away from being crowned the Queen of Wimbledon after beating world No 3 Simona Halep 7-6, 6-2 on Centre Court.

Small wonder that a well-known cola 
brand, whose endorsement is generally regarded as the holy grail for 
athletes and celebrities, have just signed up to the Bouchard bandwagon 
that shows no sign of stopping.

The
 comparisons with Maria Sharapova may soon extend to a shared long list 
of commercial  tie-ups and mentions on the Forbes rich list of athletes,
 but what most closely bonds them is their steely competitiveness.

Semi-finals
 are about mental strength more than the finesse of anyone’s game and 
beneath her cherubic exterior, Bouchard is as tough as they come, as she
 amply showed on Thursday.

There was a hiatus in the first 
set when Halep took a tumble and had her ankle strapped - which   
hampered her serving somewhat - and then another lasting four minutes 
when she trailed 2-3 in the tiebreaker after a spectator collapsed in 
the heat.

Bouchard’s concentration rode 
serenely through them both, and only when the winning post came into 
view did she betray any sign of nerves against an opponent also known as
 a fine competitor.

Watching from the Royal Box was the relatively new chief executive of the LTA, Canadian Michael Downey.

He
 got the job partly due to the progress being made in the sport in his 
native land that has manifested itself this week in the success of 
Bouchard and Milos Raonic.

It
 is possible the Champions’ Dinner might have to be draped in the Maple 
Leaf on Sunday night if Raonic blasts his way through as well, but 
Bouchard has beaten him to being the first Canadian into a Grand Slam 
singles final.

One of 
the remarkable aspects about her is the matter-of-fact attitude towards 
what she has achieved. Others might have been surprised by it, but she 
is not.

She handles questions about her ambitions - or her supposed admiration for Justin Bieber - with an aplomb beyond her years.

‘It’s
 not like a surprise to me. I expect good results like this,’ she said. 
‘So for me, I was like, OK, good. It’s a step in the right direction. I 
get to play in the final.

'I
 still have another match, so it’s not a full celebration yet. I get to 
make Canadian history again. It’s always exciting and special when I can
 make history. My job is not done.’

In
 tennis, many players get distracted if their opponent is carrying an 
injury but Bouchard retained the same laser focus throughout.

‘I’m able to not worry about the distractions, especially when it’s out of my control,’ she said.

‘Someone
 in the crowd not feeling well is definitely out of my control. It happens. I really don’t let it get to me or affect me. I love being 
challenged and I love working hard to try to overcome something. I see 
it as an opportunity.’

Bouchard
 sees it as a compliment to be compared to Sharapova, but only in terms 
of the Russian being a five-times major winner.

That would have seemed 
unthinkable three years ago when her final opponent, Petra Kvitova, won 
the title while Bouchard was reaching the quarter-finals of the junior 
event.

The Canadian’s 
ability to take the ball early troubles most opponents, and there was a 
bonus for her in that Halep, the recent French Open finalist, struggled 
with her serve after the tumble.

Yet
 it was fairly even in the first set with breaks exchanged until the 
tiebreak, when the elderly fan got into difficulties. Just after that 
Bouchard fell 2-4 behind before reeling off the next four points and 
then clinching it 7-5.

The
 Romanian subsequently lost a bit of heart and the only blot on 
Bouchard’s performance was that it took six match points from 5-1 up 
before she landed an unplayable first serve that put her through to the 
final.

Her presence 
there will add to the growing sentiment across the men’s and women’s 
games that the plates of both top 10s are shifting.
