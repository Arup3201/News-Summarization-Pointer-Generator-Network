Not since Wimbledon has Andy Murray played 40 minutes of tennis as nerve shredding as this passage that came on a Parisian lunchtime, the conclusion of which saw him squeeze through to the last 16 of the French Open.

Resuming at 7-7 against world No 24 Philipp Kohlschreiber he needed to draw on all his Grand Slam experience to eke out a 3-6 6-3 6-3 4-6 12-10 victory that took two days to complete and 247 minutes on the court.

Murray fired home a backhand return winner on his second match point when he finally managed to prise open the highly-skilled German who, if anything, had looked the slightly better player on the resumption.

Great Scot: Murray is a study of concentration as he plays a backhand on Saturday night 

'I didn’t sleep much, I kept waking 
up, I was ready to play at five o’ clock this morning,' said the 
Wimbledon champion, who will now face the hugely powerful Spanish 
left-hander Fernando Verdasco on Monday.

Murray
 had begun with an assured service game and Kohlschreiber responded in 
kind. The first match point of the day came at 9-8 after he took 
advantage of a net cord to fire a forehand winner down the line.

The
 27-year-old Scot got into the rally but was forced back and the German 
saved himself by firing home an overhead smash that must have taken an 
age to drop out of the sky.

Kohlschreiber
 had generally served more consistently while Murray struggled to find 
his first delivery again, as he had done the whole match. But when the 
world No 24 created a break point at 9-9 the Wimbledon champion 
responded with a vicious swinger that his opponent could do nothing 
about.

On the whole it  was 
the German hitting far deeper and more aggressively and Murray’s best 
play tended to come when he was scrambling deep around the court’s 
recesses. Murray missed six out of eight first serves at 10-10 but just 
about managed to hold on.

At
 11-10 Kohlschreiber, who had been finding lines and corners with 
impressive regularity while Murray generally landed it shorter in the 
court, finally cracked. He pushed two groundstrokes wide and then at 
15-40 dropped in a short second serve which his opponent pounced upon 
and drove forcefully into the corner.

It
 was not especially pretty or elegant but he is into the second week, 
drawing on what separates champions from excellent all round players 
like the crestfallen German.
