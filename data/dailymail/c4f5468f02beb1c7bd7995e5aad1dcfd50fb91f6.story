The cricketing world has reacted after Australia batsman Phillip Hughes died at the age of 25.

Cricketing legends Sachin Tendulkar and Shane Warne, as well as Hughes' close friend and team-mate David Warner, were among those mourning the death of the young cricketer after he was struck in the back of the head under his helmet from a short-pitched ball at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 

Warner, who left hospital in tears on Thursday, tweeted: 'Brothers in arms, RIP mate. I will always walk out there forever knowing your by my side. Love you BRAZ!!'

Former Australia coach Tim Nielsen posted a picture of Hughes with Ricky Ponting and the message: 'We lost a little ripper today. Honesty, hard work and humour typified the man, taken away way too soon. Always 63no.'

Another former team-mate Glenn Maxwell wrote simply '63 not out forever... #RIPHughesy', while Brett Lee posted a picture of the two together and tweeted: 'No words can describe the loss. Rip'

Hughes' popularity was reflected by the flood of messages on social media from cricketers the world over.

England batsman Ian Bell wrote on Twitter: 'Absolutely devastated to hear that Phil has passed away. Thoughts and prayers with his family and friends.'

Sir Ian Botham said: 'A very sad day for the world of cricket. So sorry for Phillip Hughes and his family. Spare a thought for Sean Abbott.'

Former Australia wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist tweeted: 'No no no no no. RIP Phillip Hughes' while England batsman Kevin Pietersen posted almost the exact same message.

Kevin Pietersen added: 'Sean Abbot - thinking about you too mate!'

Australia team doctor Peter Brukner revealed the news on Thursday morning: 'It is my sad duty to inform you that a short time ago Phillip Hughes passed away.

'He never regained consciousness following his injury on Tuesday.

'He was not in pain before he passed and was surrounded by his family and close friends.

'As a cricket community we mourn his loss and extend our deepest sympathies to Phillip's family and friends at this incredibly sad time.

'Cricket Australia kindly asks that the privacy of the Hughes family, players and staff be respected.'

The England and Wales Cricket Board sent condolence to Hughes' family in a statement released on Thursday morning.

'This is sad and shocking news and the ECB joins England Cricket in extending its deepest sympathies and heartfelt condolences to the family of Phillip as well as all the members of the cricketing family who regarded him as a friend or colleague,' said chairman Giles Clarke.

'He was an extremely popular and hugely respected cricketer in England and Wales not only as a successful tourist with various Australian teams but also as a wonderfully talented county player with Hampshire, Middlesex and Worcestershire.

'He will be missed throughout the world of cricket and today our thoughts are with his family and all those involved in Australian cricket.'

Two of the English counties that Hughes represented, Middlesex and Worcestershire, also mourned his death.

Worcestershire tweeted: '#RIPHughesy a much loved Pear, his passing is a great loss to the game. #475' 

Middlesex said in a statement: 'Middlesex County Cricket Club is devastated on hearing the tragic news concerning the passing of Phillip Hughes.

'The thoughts and love of everyone at the Club goes out to Phil's family and friends during this terrible time.

'Phil was a bright, talented and fun young man, who made a huge impression on the Club during his brief stay here at Lord's. Middlesex CCC is proud that he represented the Club.

'Out of respect to Phil and his family, the Club and its staff will be making no further public comment.

'Official Club training has been cancelled for two days and the flags at Lord's will fly at half-mast.' 

The MCC also released a statement, in which chairman David Morgan said the Australian would be remembered fondly. 

'Cricket can be a dangerous sport,' said Morgan. 'But for a talented young man to lose his life playing the game he loved is beyond most people's comprehension.

'Known as he was to so many at Lord's, this news will be hard felt.'

The Federation of International Cricketers' Associations said in a statement that they were shocked and saddened. 

'I have been in contact with a number of players and players' associations around the world who have all expressed shock and sadness over Phil's death' said FICA Executive Chairman, Tony Irish.

'Phil was a popular and respected cricketer not only in Australia and amongst Australian players but also amongst other players around the world. 

'I speak on behalf of the world's professional cricketers in saying what a tragic loss this is of a young man who would have had many years of international cricket ahead of him.' 

Cricket ground to a halt around the world, with New Zealand and Pakistan suspending their Test Match, India cancelling a tour match in Australia, and the announcement of the 2015 County Championship fixtures being delayed. 

There were also tributes from outside the world of cricket. Australian icons Russell Crowe and Mark Webber both expressed their condolences, as did former Prime Minister Julia Gillard.

Gillard wrote: 'The loss of Phillip Hughes is heartbreaking for our country. We grieve for a man who gave his all to the sport he loved.'

Crowed tweeted: 'Just heard. In shock. My deep condolences to the family of Phillip Hughes'
