A second British hostage ISIS fanatics are threatening to murder can today be revealed as a taxi driver who travelled to Syria to help refugees.

Islamic militants warned in a chilling video that 47-year-old Alan Henning - who is originally from the Greater Manchester area - would be the next person to die after father-of-two David Haines.

Mr Henning is believed to have been working for a Muslim charity and had originally thought that he would be released by ISIS because he was only in Syria to carry out aid work.

Wanted to help refugees: Alan Henning is believed to have been working for a Muslim charity in Syria

Threat: Islamic militants warned in a chilling video that 47-year-old Alan Henning (pictured) - who is originally from the Greater Manchester area - would be the next person to die

He was said to have been abducted by 
armed masked men who separated him from his aid worker colleagues late 
last year near Idlib.

The 
Foreign & Commonwealth Office released a photograph of Mr Henning 
this afternoon at the request of his family, a spokesman said.

BBC
 documentary maker Catrin Nye met Mr Henning when he was packing an aid 
convoy bound for Syria in Salford, Greater Manchester.

She said he was a married father-of-two and was nicknamed Gadget because of his love of technology.

He had no formal background in aid work, but felt a 'pull' to return to Syria after a previous trip to a refugee camp.

'He
 was a funny man and was cracking jokes while we were packing up and he 
took me on a taxi ride after we did the filming,' Ms Nye said.

BBC documentary maker Catrin Nye said Mr Henning (right) was a married father-of-two and 'a taxi driver, not a professional aid worker', but had felt a 'pull' to return to Syria after a previous trip to a refugee camp

'He told me that he'd been on one of 
those convoys previously and he was inpired by his friends who'd been, 
and since he'd got back he'd found it hard not to return.

'He's
 a taxi driver, not a professional aid worker - but he said he looked at
 the world differently [after he returned] and felt a pull to go back to
 Syria.

'He was very popular and friends would comment that he was very funny and very kind.

'He described holding the children ... and how that really affected him. He told me he had to go back.'

His friend Mohamed Elhaddad, company 
director of the UK Arabic Society, tonight spoke of Mr Henning's 
determination to help others.

Mr
 Elhaddad, British convoy leader, described the hostage as a passionate 
humanitarian volunteer, but said he insisted on going a long way into 
Syria to deliver aid.

Desperate conditons: Mr Haines was working in the Atmeh refugee camp (pictured). It is in the northern Syrian province of Idlib, where Mr Henning was also believed to be when he was captured by extremists late last year

Mr Elhaddad said: 'I remember 
going on two convoys with him, at the end of 2012 and in May 2013, and 
he was always very positive and very interested in the work.

'I
 have met his family and his children. The first time we went together 
he was very excited and very emotional. He does a lot for others.

'He is good at DIY and he was a useful person to have on the trips.

'But Alan went too far into Syria. He took that extra risk, because he could have accomplished the drop-off at the border.

'I
 disagree completely with what is happening to him. Alan is my friend, 
this is extremely sad for him and his family. It is a very sad 
situation.'

'Henning was genuinely trying to help the Syrian refugee crisis - nothing more. People spoke very highly of him'

Tam Hussein, Middle East journalist

Middle East journalist Tam Hussein 
revealed Mr Henning had gone to Syria because he felt needed there - 
despite warnings that he should stay away.

Mr Hussein told New York Daily News
 reporter Thomas Tracy: ‘Henning was told not (to go into) Syria… but 
insisted on going in because he had put in so much time and effort in 
the project.’

‘Henning 
wanted to make sure aid reached the intended. Henning was genuinely 
trying to help the Syrian refugee crisis - nothing more. People spoke 
very highly of him.’

Dutch 
journalist Harald Doornbos added that Mr Henning was put into an ISIS 
jail in Al-Dana following his capture - and was later moved to the 
militants’ stronghold of Raqqa.

Prime Minister David Cameron today held emergency talks with senior representatives of the military, security services, the Foreign Office and the Home Office over Mr Haines's murder.

But Government sources indicated that the death of Mr Haines, 44, would not change Britain's policy and Parliament would not be recalled to discuss the grim development.

Mr Cameron said Britain stands ready to take ‘whatever steps are necessary’ to help an international push to destroy the ‘evil’ extremist group who murdered Mr Haines.

He hailed Mr Haines - who was captured in Syria in March 2013 - as a ‘British hero’ and vowed to ‘hunt down those responsible and bring them to justice no matter how long it takes.’

Islamic State were ‘not Muslims they are monsters’, he said, and added that the UK could not afford to ignore the severe threat the jihadists' spread posed to both world and domestic security.

Mr Cameron said the UK would seek to 'mobilise the broadest possible support to bear down' on ISIS at the UN as efforts continue to form a coalition of countries to take part in a concerted offensive.

ISIS released footage last night showing Mr Haines being murdered by a knife-wielding militant, who appears to speak with a British accent.
