Poor timekeeping has been one of the issues surrounding West Brom’s troublesome striker Saido Berahino, who did not celebrate any of his four goals in the 7-0 FA Cup win over Gateshead. 

Berahino has reported late for match days three times this season, the latest being the Manchester City game on Boxing Day for which he has already paid his fine.

The Burundi-born forward, who earned his first England squad call-up for the Slovenia and Scotland matches but played no part, was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving at high speed last October, after which West Brom postponed any talk of a new contract. And Berahino’s form had rapidly declined until last Saturday. 

New manager Tony Pulis is expected to try to revitalise Berahino, 21, rather than sell him this month despite interest from Liverpool.

Blackburn Rovers are one of three Football League clubs banned from doing business in this transfer window after breaching financial fair play regulations. 

Yet Robert Coar, one of the club’s two directors, is entrusted with the role of chairman of the FA’s football regulatory authority. Only in football could this happen, with the FA and FL seeing no problem with Coar continuing to rule on regulatory issues.

Non-League side Blyth Spartans are complaining to the FA about their £6,750 fee for Match of the Day highlights coverage of their third-round Cup match against Birmingham. 

The Beeb had seven cameras at Croft Park, meaning Blyth had to take out seats and standing areas that would have brought in £6,000 worth of ticket sales. 

And the TV requirements also restricted entry to the club shop. An FA spokesman said: ‘The fee is really just to compensate costs.’

Barrow’s big bash

The most unlikely football kit launch of 2015 took place on New Year’s Day on the top floor of London’s Gherkin skyscraper. 

The glitzy venue wasn’t hosting a Barclays Premier League event, but the unveiling of Vanarama Conference North side Barrow’s strip for next season supplied by British company PlayerLayer.

The lavish party was a statement about the grand ambitions of Barrow-born owner Paul Casson, a Dallas-based telecoms millionaire. Family man Casson, who had most of his many relatives from the North West at the champagne reception, is confident enough about taking his club — lying second in the table — up through the tiers of English football to have started making a film about the journey.

Sky Sports News’ significant efforts to promote women in sport continue to be undermined by their own staff on social media. The latest post that would have infuriated the Isleworth high command was reporter Andy Burton retweeting American poker player Dan Blizerian’s comment: ‘Woke up with this in my bed’ next to a photograph of a scantily clad woman. Burton added: ‘Here’s to being more like this guy in 2015.’ Burton later deleted the post of his own accord.

Channel 4 are considering celebrity options to present their Grand National coverage in April following Clare Balding’s defection to host the Boat Race for the BBC on the same day.

Possible names include Jeremy Kyle, host of a confrontational daytime chat show that focuses on relationship feuds, and football and Formula One presenter Jake Humphrey.

Nick Luck, the regular racing anchor in Balding’s absence, has won many awards. But he is not considered a big enough name for the Aintree showcase because the National attracts a much wider once-a-year audience than the normal racing programming.

Kyle is a racing enthusiast who has horses in training with Nick Gifford. But to have such a newcomer presenting the race will not go down well with Turf diehards, especially on such a prestigious occasion.

At least Humphrey has experience of live sports presenting, though not in racing, and working on the National requires extensive knowledge of the race.

A C4 spokesman said that no decision had yet been made on the National presenter.
