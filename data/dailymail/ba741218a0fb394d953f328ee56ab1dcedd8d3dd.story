Andre Schurrle is hoping to add to his World Cup medal with more silverware at Chelsea this season.

The 23-year-old German international scored three goals in Brazil and also set up Mario Gotze's extra-time winner in the 1-0 final victory over Argentina.

But the winger's attention has now returned to club duty with Chelsea and, after a well-deserved break, he is hoping to carry his form over from Rio de Janeiro to the Premier League.

‘It’s an amazing feeling, I feel very good,’ Schurlle told www.chelseafc.com. 

‘I’ve had a nice holiday after some big celebrations but it’s nice to be back and now I’m highly motivated to do big things with Chelsea this season.'

Along with the other World Cup late-comers, Schurrle returned to Chelsea training at Cobham on Monday.

He was joined by Jose Mourinho's summer signings, which include Didier Drogba and Cesc Fabregas, who he believes will all provide the club with a major boost.

‘It will take a bit of time to get going but we have great staff here, a great team and hopefully I’ll be fit by the time the season starts,' said Schurrle.

‘They’re all world-class players, Drogba’s back with his club and Fabregas is one of the best players in the world. 

'We played against Filipe Luis last season when he was with Atletico and he did very well. 

'I saw Diego Costa’s goal against Olimpija Lubjlana and it was a great finish, so I’m looking forward to playing with all of them, they all have great quality.’
