A bedridden man who allegedly ordered cruel beatings of his eight-year-old daughter, made her drink her urine and forced her to be tied to his bed has been charged with her murder.

Even though 28-year-old Andre Ford was himself unable to touch his daughter, prosecutors maintain that the man, who suffers from a degenerative skin disease, caused her death.

The girl, Gizzell Ford, was found dead in the Austin, Illinois home she shared with her father, her two older brothers and her grandmother on July 12.

Firefighters responded to a call saying the little girl was not breathing and found her body covered in bruises, scratches and lacerations. They also found maggots in a cut to her head.

An autopsy revealed that the cause of death was strangulation and multiple blunt trauma injuries, and the death was ruled a homicide.

Ford and his mother, 52-year-old Helen Ford, both stand accused of murder in the case. They were the only adults living at the home, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.

Authorities allege that from his bed, Ford forced the little girl to suck up her urine after she wet herself, ordered her to be harnessed to his bed and simply watched as his mother tortured her.

The Illinois Department of Children 
and Family Services also completed a report indicating that both Andre 
and Helen Ford abused, neglected and starved Gizzell and her two 
brothers.

'It doesn't 
happen everyday but we do charge people on the theory of 
accountability,' Sally Daly, a spokeswoman with the State's Attorney's 
Office, told the Sun-Times.

Prosecutors listed several other 
injuries found on the girl's body at an earlier hearing. They found a 
deep laceration on her buttocks, ligature marks on the girl's ankles and
wrists and circular marks which may have been cigarette burns.

There were cuts on her face, ears and lips, as well as bruises and puncture wounds on her back, chest and abdomen, with bruising on the front and back of her neck.

Investigators also recovered a pole, 
twine and cables from the apartment - some of which had blood on them, 
according to the prosecutor.

Ford suffers from the chronic degenerative disease of scleroderma, which leaves his skin and tissues hard. It has led some to question how he could be responsible in the death.

But Bruce Boyer, director of Civitas ChildLaw Clinic at Loyola University's Law School, said the fact he did not contact authorities implicated him.

'You don't have to physically wrestle the person who is swinging the club,' he said. 'Pick up the phone, tell a neighbor.'

He initially told authorities that his daughter's wounds were self-inflicted because she was upset that her mother had not been visiting, but he later admitted he stopped her from going to a summer camp so others did not see her injuries, prosecutors said.

He also allegedly told detectives he never contacted authorities as he feared he would be blamed for her injuries.

Ford has been transferred to a local hospital for treatment and is now awaiting trial with his mother.

The two other children, aged 12 and nine, have been since placed in foster care.
