In the last couple of weeks, two relationships with enormous age gaps have caught the nation's attention. 

The first was Stephen Fry's engagement to Elliott Spencer, who is 30 years younger than him - the happy couple are now married after signing the civil register in Dereham, Norfolk. 

The second was the news that Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page was dating a woman 46 years his junior.

But why do age gaps continue to shock? Older men dating women in their twenties has been happening for centuries.

Stephen Fry, 57, and his partner, stand-up comedian Elliott Spencer, 27. The pair, who have a 30 year age difference, got married yesterday afternoon in Norfolk. They are one of several Hollywood romances that features an age gap spanning generations and the difference in maturity has sparked enormous interest from the British public. But why do age gap romances continue to be such a source of fascination, given that they have been happening for centuries? 

But each time an older man steps out with a young woman, or more recently the reverse, the nation makes a collective gasp. 

Demi Moore married Ashton Kutcher, who was 15 years her junior, and the couple stayed together for several years, but the public were never quite able to get to grips with the romance.

Caroline Flack's fling with Harry Styles caused such disgust that for a time it almost looked like it would derail her career. 

And Madonna's love of toyboys in recent years has almost overshadowed her musical career. 

In Hollywood alone, there have been numerous romances between women and men of different generations in the last yen years alone.

So why do some men and women go for someone much older or younger instead or a person their own age? 

Sex therapist Louise Van De Velde, who wrote the book Decent Proposal, says it's a cliche, but age is nothing but a number. 

She explained to FEMAIL: 'In case you haven't noticed, we feel the same as we get older as we did when we were young, on the inside at least - it's only when we look in the mirror we see the signs of ageing. 

'Psychologically, having a trophy wife on your arm gives the same effect as flash cars and watches - admiration and significance, it's almost as if having this young partner quantifies how successful they are.'

But although she understands the reasons for wanting a younger woman or man on your arm, Louise warns that there are several cons to an age gap relationship. 

She said: 'This difference in age creates many problems as interests do change with age, as do energy levels. 

'It is well known that men and women reach their sexual peak at a different ages (men early 20s women late 30s early 40s), so while a young toy boy may well be able to satisfy  an older woman an older man may leave his younger wife feeling unfulfilled. 

'This is not something to be overlooked - sex is key to all successful relationships as it clears blocks and maintains connection.

'However, if the partners can embrace the differences, then maturity can be a good balance for the immaturity and the youthful enthusiasm can keep the older partner young.'

Friends of Stephen Fry say that his relationship with Elliott Spencer has made him happier than he has been in years

According to new research by dating website EliteSingles, the stereotype of the older man seeking an increasingly younger partner does in fact ring true. 

Men aged 60-69 set, on average, a desired partner age of up to 11 years younger than themselves, while the oldest they would accept is someone just 1 year older.

But younger men buck the trend, with those aged up to 30 preferring to date someone older than younger. Between the ages of 20-29, many men indicate a preference for a partner 3-6 years older than themselves.

The website's psychologist Sam Owen believes that men aged 20-29 now looking for older women pver a younger model is largely down to the change in gender roles in modern society, with far more equality between the sexes nowadays.

He said: 'Young men nowadays probably recognise that older women are adept at diligently juggling so many responsibilities like a career, children, housekeeping, fitness, finances and socialising.

'This makes them intriguing, attractive and a more secure option.'
