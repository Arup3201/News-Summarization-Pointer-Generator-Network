David Lowe, who was sacked after he played an old version of The Sun Has Got Its Hat On, claims the show was pre-recorded - but no one at the BBC approved it for transmission before it was played

The BBC DJ who left the BBC after accidentally playing a song with a racial slur in it claims it is on the corporation's approved list - and still is now.

David Lowe, lost his job after playing a 1932 version of The Sun Has Got His Hat On during his Sunday night show on BBC Radio Devon.

The version contains the line: ‘He’s been tanning n****** out in Timbuktu, now he’s coming back to do the same to you.’

Following
 the broadcast, Mr Lowe immediately offered to apologise on air for his 
error - but the corporation ordered Mr Lowe to 'fall on his sword' after
 just one listener complained.

According to the Mirror, the 68-year-old told The Jon Gaunt Show on Fubar Radio: 'When talking about my treatment, I prefer to use the word ‘inconsistencies’, rather than ‘double-standards’, because to the best of my knowledge, the version of the song I played was, certainly until just a few days ago, on the BBC’s ‘Okay to play’ list.

‘And one of my all-time favourites, Oliver’s Army by Elvis Costello, which features the N-word, is still played regularly on British radio.'

Mr Lowe has said the show was 
pre-recorded - but it not approved for transmission by station managers 
as required by the BBC's compliance system.

He added that the BBC management structure was 'flawed' and should be 'scrapped'.

Mr Lowe said: 'I don’t have any quarrels with my BBC colleagues  - my quarrel is with the flawed system they are trying to work with.

'The BBC is trying to be all things to all men and women - and that’s an impossibility in anyone’s language.'

Mr Lowe played a 1932 version of the son, performed by Amrbose & His Orchestra, on a Sunday night golden oldies show

A BBC spokeswoman said: 'David's show is a specialist music show and he played the track out of his own personal music collection.

'We don't have an 'approved' list. Nor do we have a 'banned' list.

The
 lyrics to The Sun Has Got His Hat On have been changed several times 
since Noel Gay (above) and Ralph Butler wrote the original in 1932.

It
 was composed for the musical Me And My Girl and first recorded by the 
Henry Hall BBC Dance Orchestra, with vocals by Val Rosing.

The second verse went: ‘He’s been tanning n*****s out in Timbuktu, Now he’s coming back to do the same for you.’

More
 recent versions have changed it to: ‘He’s been roastin’ peanuts out in 
Timbuktu’ or just ‘shining brightly out  in Timbuktu’.

'We make editorial decisions about what records to play on a case-by-case basis taking a wide range of contextual factors into account.

'As we’ve made clear, we accept that the discussion with David Lowe about his future could have been handled better.

'We don’t ban records and the decision about which records to play on local or national radio is for individual producers or presenters, as it always has been.

'We make editorial decisions about what records to play on a case-by-case basis taking a wide range of contextual factors into account.

'David Lowe's weekly show was categorised as low risk and therefore did not require complex sign off procedures.

'We do not require managers to listen to programmes categorised as low risk if the producer of the programme is happy that it complies with BBC Editorial Guidelines.

'The producer in this case was David Lowe.

'The key point remains that we should not have accepted his resignation.'

She added that the door remains open if he wishes to resume his show.

Some have accused the BBC of double 
standards for allowing Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson to keep his job 
after mumbling the N-word in an outtake of his motoring show.

Mr Lowe's former boss at BBC Radio Devon Roy Corlett, said at the time: ‘To end David’s career in this way when Clarkson was given a rap on the knuckles is absolutely appalling.

'It is an outrageous way to treat a loyal and distinguished employee. You couldn’t wish to meet a nicer man.’

Prime Minister David Cameron said his dismissal was 'slightly unfair' while Mayor of London Boris Johnson said the corporation acted in a 'disgraceful' way by firing the veteran DJ.
