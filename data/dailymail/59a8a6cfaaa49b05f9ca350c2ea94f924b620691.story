Ed Miliband was last night accused of backsliding from his pledge to wean Labour off its reliance on union funding by delaying reform for five years.

The Labour leader had previously vowed to overhaul party funding to give union members more rights to opt out of funding Labour through the political levy.

He made the promise in the wake of the Falkirk candidate selection scandal, which laid bare Labour’s reliance on the union Unite.

Ed Miliband was last night accused of backsliding from his pledge to wean Labour off its reliance on union funding by delaying reform for five years

But it has now emerged that Mr Miliband only wants to give that option to new union members and to enact the changes over five years.

The move is seen by critics as an attempt to appease Labour’s union paymasters, whose funding accounts for around £8 out of every £10 raised since Mr Miliband became leader in 2010. 

It is also seen as a ploy for the cash-strapped party not to lose its main revenue stream. In July, Mr Miliband vowed to reform funding, saying: ‘You have my word that this reform will be thorough, wholesale and lasting.’ 

Last night Grant Shapps, chairman of the Conservative Party, said: ‘In the summer, Ed Miliband promised to take on Len McCluskey’s Unite union by reforming the Labour Party’s link with the unions.

‘But now we learn that Ed Miliband is buckling under pressure from his union paymasters and watering down his reform proposals.

‘Once again, Ed Miliband has shown he’s too weak to stand up to the union barons fixing his own party’s selections. And if he’s too weak to stand up to Len McCluskey, Ed Miliband’s too weak to stand up for hard-working people.’ 

Mr Miliband is now locked in talks with the unions and Lord Collins, former general secretary of the party, according to the Guardian.

Unite’s executive will meet next week to decide whether to back the reform, which Mr Miliband said is designed to mend, not end, the party’s union link.

Unions fear their voting rights at the Labour conference and in leadership elections could be slashed if they sever the funding link.

Jim Kelly, chairman of the London and eastern region of Unite, said: ‘Our executive has got to keep a collective voice and that collective voice has to be expressed through the block vote at a decision-making party conference where unions keep 50 per cent of the vote. That is the main point.

‘If unions stand together, with half the votes at Labour’s conference, and supported by many constituency parties worried about the severe threat to the party’s finances from Ed Miliband’s proposals, as well as the negative impact on the left within the party, then the link can be successfully defended.

‘The changes that were proposed were not thought through and they are both bad for the unions and bad for the party.’

Grant Shapps, Chairman of the Conservative Party criticised the move.

A Labour spokesman said: ‘The Collins review consultation is still ongoing. There will be a special conference in spring 2014 to decide on its conclusions.’
