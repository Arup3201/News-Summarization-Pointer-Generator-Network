Edward Snowden has thrown a ‘huge rock’ at the intelligence agencies – and his leaks mean a terrorist atrocity was now certain to ‘get through’, according to the former head of MI6.

Sir John Sawers’ warning came as Al Qaeda posted a YouTube video showing fanatics how to avoid detection, apparently based on the former CIA officer’s leaks.

Yesterday, former MI6 boss Sir John said the revelations had made the technology companies more reluctant to co-operate with the police and spy agencies. 

Ex MI6 boss Sir John Sawers (pictured) warned Edward Snowden has thrown 'huge rock' at intelligence agencies, meaning a terrorist atrocity is now certain to 'get through' 

Security officials fear this has created ‘no-go areas’ on the internet where terrorists can plot atrocities undetected.

Sir John warned that, unless a ‘new compact’ could be agreed between web firms and the intelligence agencies, attacks like those in Paris earlier this month would become ‘a more regular feature of our lives’.

He said: ‘Snowden threw a massive rock in the pool. The ripples from that have still not died down.

‘It was certainly a great concern for me that the, if you like, informal co-operation that worked well between most technology companies and communication companies and security services was broken by the Snowden revelations and has not been repaired.’

Sir John added: ‘The security community has done a fantastic job keeping threats at bay, but if I was to sit here and ask “will the goalkeepers of the police and security services foil every single attempt to score a goal?”, the answer is no. At some point a threat will get through.’  

British security officials have long warned the Snowden revelations could be used to produce a ‘handbook for terrorists’.

The chilling seven-and-a-half minute video by Al Qaeda – which includes news footage of Snowden’s massive security breach – confirms these worst fears.

The recording provides detailed graphics on how extremists can avoid being trapped by ‘FBI secret spying technology’ when communicating.

Extracts from the video by Al Qaeda – and the corresponding leaks by treacherous former CIA officer Edward Snowden (pictured right):

SNOWDEN LEAK: NSA and GCHQ are harvesting millions of emails, instant messaging contact lists and details of internet browsing histories.

AL QAEDA ADVICE: ‘All your calls, messages and internet history are stored in this same place… spies have access to these files and can know your daily routine, friends and what you are planning to do tomorrow night at that tall building….’

SNOWDEN LEAK: Western agencies have the capacity to track and map the location of cell phones.

AL QAEDA ADVICE: ‘All mobile phone providers use the same software, your device continuously is in contact with the nearest tower… As you are moving around your different coordinates are tracked and stored.’

SNOWDEN LEAK: Security officials were paying private tech companies for ‘clandestine access’ to their communications networks.

AL QAEDA GUIDANCE: The video warns Al Qaeda agents that spies are working with internet companies and lists networks which have been co-operating so they can be avoided.

It also claims to identify technology companies which are co-operating with the UK and other countries so they can be avoided.

There is a list of software packages that can be used to try to thwart GCHQ and the intelligence agencies.

The video is spoken in Arabic but with English subtitles. It says: ‘Allah created us with a unique voice, this can be used to track you anywhere no matter [sic] you buy a new phone, SIM card or satellite.

'We will now show you some different ways how the enemy can track you and have a view at some modern war technologies.’

It added: ‘Every mujahed that does not take the right precautions can be a tool in the hand of the enemy. With his phone, tablet or laptop the enemy can listen/record all conversations and meetings.’

Experts said Snowden – feted as a hero by some campaigners – had inspired the tape.

Sir John’s speech yesterday, his first since stepping down last November, was the second time in a week an ex-head of the intelligence agencies has attacked Snowden.

Last Tuesday, ex-MI5 boss Jonathan Evans said the revelations have left Britain less able to protect itself at a time when the terrorist threat from Islamist fanatics is surging.

In the wake of the Paris attacks, David Cameron vowed that a new Tory government would introduce 'comprehensive' legislation to ensure there is no 'safe space' for terrorists to communicate over the internet.

The Prime Minister said security and intelligence agencies need 'robust powers' to protect the public from violent extremists.

Mr Cameron had already indicated he would seek to revive measures in the abandoned draft communications data bill - dubbed the 'snoopers' charter' by critics - enabling the agencies to track emails and other online communications.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is blocking the bill - insisting it gives the security services too much power to snoop on the public.

Snowden, who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in Hawaii, tricked colleagues into handing over passwords so he could copy up to 1.7million files in one of the biggest leaks in US history.

The defence contractor claims he had to act because the US government’s policies were a ‘threat to democracy’.

He fled to Hong Kong, then Russia, where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location. 

Speaking at the London launch of the Edelman Trust Barometer, an international survey of public trust in institutions, Sir John said: 'We have seen a trend over the last few years of the threat rising, the formal threat level has gone up which says that a terrorist attack is highly likely.

'That is not saying an attempted terrorist attack is highly likely. It is saying a terrorist attack getting through is highly likely and we have to take those words at face value.'

He also backed the Prime Minister’s assertion last week that there cannot be ‘no-go areas’ online or in other types of communications. 

He added: 'The prime minister must have been right when he was saying last week that you cannot afford to have complete no-go areas.

'We cannot have no-go areas in our communities where the police cannot go, because that just allows space room for the evil doers to ply their trades. It is the same in the virtual world.

'If you allow areas which are completely impenetrable, then, okay, you might feel comfortable that your communications are private and no one else can see them, but so are those who are trying to do you down and undermine your society.' 

But the warning will be seen as a direct rebuke to the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg who is blocking proposals to give Britain's spooks the power to monitor what people browse on the internet and who they are emailing.
