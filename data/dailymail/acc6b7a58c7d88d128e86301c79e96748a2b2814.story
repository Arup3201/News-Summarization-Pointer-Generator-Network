Doctors are baffled after an apparently healthy mother and her teenage son died from a mysterious illness just days apart.

Zack Smith, 19, passed away at a hospital in St Peters, Missouri on Sunday and his mother, 48-year-old Rhona Smith, died on Thursday morning.

The St. Charles County Health Department has met with infectious disease doctors since her death to figure out what led to their sudden decline in health, but relatives say physicians suggested the pair may have been suffering from a particularly virulent strain of the flu.

Zack Smith went to St. Joseph's health Center on Friday after suffering flu-like symptoms and coughing up blood, according to a gofundme page set up for the family.

An hour later, relatives were told that his health was quickly deteriorating, KMOV reported.

Over the next two days, doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia and a staph infection, and his organs began shutting down. He went into cardiac arrest and died on Sunday morning.

According to the gofundme page, doctors told his family that it appeared he had a strand of the flu not prevented by a flu shot.

'They said the explanation of death was even more to the fact they felt it was a strand of the flu from Africa,' relative Scott Dyer told KMOV.

His mother Rhona shared photos of her son to her Facebook page after news of his death. 

'So completely destroyed inside and out,' she posted to her page on Sunday. 'My sweet precious son Zack lost the fight of his life this morning I am still at a loss of understanding how I walked in to the ER with him just 2 short days ago and now he is gone...

'I just want you back baby boy. I love you so so so much.'

Heartbroken: Hours after her son's death - and just a few days before her own - Rhonda shared the tragic news to her Facebook page. She leaves behind three other children, aged 12, 16 and 21

Questions: The St. Charles County Health Department has met with infectious disease doctors since the pair passed away to try to figure out what caused their health to deteriorate so rapidly

But on Wednesday, family took her to Barnes St. Peters Hospital after she felt hot and complained of a pain in her side.

'While we all thought she was just heart broken and depressed from losing her son we took her to the urgent care,' the gofundme page explains. 'They immediately referred us to the ER due to her blood sugar levels greatly above what their meter could read.'

Doctors said that her blood sugar levels were so high that she was at risk of slipping into a diabetic coma, even though she did not have diabetes.

Her health declined dramatically and she started experiencing problems breathing.

Her heart stopped eight times and she was repeatedly revived, but after the eighth time, doctors were unable to find a pulse. She passed away less than 12 hours after being admitted.

'My sister went to heaven early this morning and is now resting peacefully with her son and mother,' Rhonda's sister Wanda wrote on Facebook on Thursday. 'I am extremely saddened by this. Having a very hard time coping with losing 2 close members of my family in less than 72hrs.'

Doctors told family members to get tested for the flu and chest X-rays in case they have also contracted the virus. 

Shock: Relative Scott Dyer said doctors thought they were struck with a particularly virulent strain of the flu

Potent: There is still high flu activity across the U.S., as shown on this map released by the CDC. The Centers said more than 13,300 people have been hospitalized with the flu this season and 86 children have died

An autopsy is being carried out on Rhonda's body to find the cause of her death and the health department said they hope to know more once lab tests are completed.

Rhonda leaves behind three more children, aged 12, 16 and 21. 

'Any prayers sent our way would be more than appreciated,' relatives wrote on the gofundme page. 'We are all very frightened and hurting in this tragic time.'

Flu activity has been elevated for 13 weeks across the country and has claimed the lives of as many as 86 children this season, according to the CDC.

A total of 13,320 people have been hospitalized with confirmed cases of the flu since October 1, 2014, the CDC said in its latest report.

The CDC added that, because the flu season started earlier that normal last year, it is likely to last longer than the average of 13 weeks.
