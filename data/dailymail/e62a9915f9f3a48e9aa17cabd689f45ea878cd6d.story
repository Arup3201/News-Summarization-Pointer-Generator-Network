A teenager who gave birth to a baby boy on a plane at 38,000ft was allowed to board because airline staff couldn't see she was pregnant under her baggy clothes.

Fatoumatta Kaba, 17, went into labor four hours into a South African Airways flight from Johannesburg to New York's John F. Kennedy airport on Saturday and 'in two pushes' delivered her son Mamel Joella with the help of an American doctor who happened to be on the flight.

But the airline said staff had no idea Ms Kaba was even expecting when they let her get on the aircraft, adding that South
African Airways policy bans pregnant woman from flying internationally after 35
weeks.

'(Ms
Kaba) was dressed in such a manner that on plain view there was no way 
you could have detected that she was pregnant,' spokesman Tlali Tlali 
told MailOnline.

Meanwhile, the doctor who delivered the teen's baby mid-flight has described the moment she saw his tiny head appear.

Dr Julie Williamson said the young mom delivered her little boy 'in two pushes' before sitting back in her seat for the remainder of the flight.

Dr Williamson was on her way home from a medical conference in South Africa when Ms Kaba went into labor four hours after take off.

As the passengers panicked, Ms Kaba just quietly got on with delivering baby Mamel Joella, the medic said.

She told the Daily News:  'While there was a lot of discussion whether to divert the flight, she 
made the decision for us by saying, ''Push!'' And when we checked, the 
baby was crowning, and she delivered him in two pushes.'

South African Airways said the surprise in-flight deliver ended well in Ms Kaba's case but she may not have been so lucky, which is why passenger are required to inform the airline if they are in the late stages of pregnancy.

'The primary responsibility rests 
with the passenger to inform the airline of any medical condition,' Tlali said. 'If 
they do not they risk exposing themselves to danger and their unborn 
baby to danger particularly as there can be all sorts of complications with childbirth.'

The carrier said it was not planning 
to overhaul any policies to ensure a woman who is more than 35 weeks does not get on a flight undetected again.

'There
is no way that we could 
identify passengers we believe could be pregnant. Screening them would 
amount to harassment,' Tlali told MailOnline. 'No airline in the world 
would do that.'

'If someone is pregnant they are 
required to be checked by a medical practitioner of their choice and 
show us proof that the doctor has given them approval to fly.'

Thankfully, Ms Kaba and little Mamel are now doing well 
in hospital - and the brave teenager insists that giving birth at 38,000ft was no ordeal.

Ms Kaba the Daily News yesterday: 'I wasn't scared to have the baby, I was very happy. I feel better now after delivering the baby. Everything's OK.'

She
plans to stay with family for a few weeks after being discharged from 
hospital, and will then return to Africa to rejoin her husband, 
38-year-old Gambian diplomat Abubakary Jawara.

She told the newspaper she would never have thought she would become the center of so much attention after the Saturday drama.

'I just expected to come here and be happy and visit my family and then go back to my husband,' she said.

When the young woman went into labor, the crew asked over the loudspeaker if a doctor was on board.

To the rescue: Doctors Julie Williamson and Steve Paridon helped the teenager through her quick delivery

Luckily for Ms Kaba, who is originally
from Angola, Dr Williamson, a pediatric
anesthesiologist, was on her way home to 
California from a medical conference in South Africa, along with Dr 
Steve Paridon.

It was a nerve-wracking experience 
for Dr Williamson -  the mother of two had not delivered a baby since she was in medical school 15 years ago.

Passengers were amazed that the young girl barely uttered a sound during the quick delivery four hours into the 14 hour flight. 

Her newborn son was immediately wrapped in blankets and rocked by airline crew as they walked up and down the aisles.

South
African airways had considered diverting the flight, but once it became
clear the pair were okay they continued to their destination, with Ms Kaba returning to her seat for the rest of the journey.

Once
they touched down, mother and baby were taken to Jamaica Medical Center
in Queens to be checked over after their arrival in the U.S.

Ms Kaba's sister-in-law met them at the airport and traveled with them to hospital where they were listed as healthy.

Mamel will not be an American citizen because the flight was not in U.S. airspace when his mother gave birth.
