Thierry Henry will make his big screen debut in 2015 as he makes a short cameo appearance in the Entourage movie.

Former Arsenal striker Henry announced his retirement from playing football earlier this month after ending his career at New York Red Bulls.

The 37-year-old has joined Sky Sports as pundit and confirmed he will earn his coaching badges in the hope of one day becoming manager of the Gunners, where he played for eight years.
