After being pictured in an intimate clinch in a nightclub, the Speaker’s wife might have been expected to lie low for a while.

But Sally Bercow took to Twitter for several hours to talk about her ‘tough week’ and slam reports that her husband is ‘distraught’ about her drinking.

The mother-of-three has spoken candidly about her battle with alcoholism, and told her 5,000 followers on the site on Saturday night she had been ‘in denial’ about her drinking during the 1990s.

John Bercow is understood to have asked his wife Sally to seek help for her drinking after being pictured kissing dancer Clinton Baugh in a London nightclub last week

But
 she claimed in a series of tweets that after abstaining for more than a
 decade, she was now drinking ‘like a normal person’, claiming the 
‘insecurities [and] issues that made me drink to excess [are] no longer 
present.’

Friends of the Commons Speaker (left) say he is 'distraught' by his wife's refusal to take his advice

She finally 
signed off around 1am saying: ‘Bed now for me and beloved but 
‘distraught’ Mr B. I had two glasses of wine this eve - shocking huh!’ 
She then used the hashtag #ragingalcoholic’.

Her
 comment appeared to be in response to a newspaper story claiming John 
Bercow had been begging her to get professional help for her drinking, 
fearing it could ruin their marriage, and alleged he had been left 
‘distraught’ by her failure to follow his advice.

Last
 week 44-year-old Mrs Bercow was pictured kissing professional dancer 
Clinton Baugh, while on a night out at the No5 Cavendish Square 
nightclub - her blonde hair covered up by a brunette wig.

After
 pictures of the pair were published, she insisted it had been taken out
 of context, and hit out at critics saying: ‘I don’t need to apologise 
to John, I’ve done nothing wrong.

'Mr marriage is my business. I couldn’t
 give a damn what people think. Let people judge me if they want. The 
guy in the picture is a friend. End of.’

But
 a guest at the nightclub where she was attending a party hosted by 
reality TV stars, claimed she ‘couldn’t take her hands off’ Mr
 Baugh, adding: ‘You could tell Sally was drunk. She appeared unsteady 
on her feet and her top was stained...she didn’t seem to care who was 
watching her.’

Yesterday
 a friend of her husband was quoted as saying: ‘John has been worried 
about her drinking for some time. He has pleaded with her to accept 
professional help but she is resisting.

‘He
 is distraught, because she is worryingly disinclined to think she has a
 problem or should seek help for it. It is putting the marriage in 
danger.’

The friend 
claimed Mrs Bercow - who admitted drinking up to two bottles of wine a 
day in her 20s - had started drinking and socialising heavily in the 
summer of 2012 after years of abstinence.

This
 weekend Mrs Bercow had a lengthy chat with Twitter users, many of whom 
took her side about starting to drink again. She told how after giving 
up alcohol in 2001, she had been ‘drinking like a normal person for last
 18 months.’

And 
courted controversy by saying: ‘I know the AA lobby won’t like this and I
 understand why but for some (few) people it is possible to resume 
drinking after a prolonged period of abstinence.

Mrs Bercow admits she used to drink up to two bottles of wine a day during her 20s, but is 'very strict' now

She
 added: ‘Had a decade off and have strict rules but so far am doing ok 
being off the wagon. Though it’s not PC [politically correct] to say 
that obviously.’ She added she only drinks wine - never spirits.

Mrs
 Bercow complained about the pressure of her position talking about the 
‘real issue is that they expect wives of senior politicians to conform. 
Sod that - I married John, not ‘Mr Speaker.’

After
 hitting out at that the ‘friends’ of Mr Bercow briefing against her, 
she said: ‘John and I got no idea what you’re talking about. Stop trying
 to destroy our marriage’.

She
 added: ‘It’s been a tough week for me and J (my fault!)’ and told her 
followers ‘but nothing compared to comrades’ daily hardships. You have 
my utmost respect’.
