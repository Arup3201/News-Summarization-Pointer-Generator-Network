Victoria Beckham was last night embroiled in a race row, accused of failing to use ‘models of colour’ in her fashion shows.

The former Spice Girl featured twice on a list of designers compiled by supermodels Iman and Naomi Campbell who they claim are ‘guilty of this racist act’.

Mrs Beckham’s eponymous main line was named, as well as her Victoria, Victoria Beckham diffusion line.

Other high-profile names listed include Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Chanel, Armani, Gucci, Saint Laurent, Roberto Cavalli and Marc by Marc Jacobs.

Iman (L) has joined forces with Naomi Campbell (R) to highlight the lack of models of colour currently taking to the catwalk

Mrs Beckham unveiled both her collections at New York Fashion Week last week.

Her
main line catwalk show, attended by husband David and daughter Harper, 
appeared to involve only one non-white model, while photos of her 
diffusion line featured just two white models.

Iman, who is married to 
David Bowie, and Miss Campbell have joined forces with former model 
turned campaigner Bethann Hardison to create the Diversity Coalition, 
which aims to highlight racial prejudices in the fashion industry. 

In
an open letter to the governing bodies of the fashion industries in New
York, London, Paris and Milan, the trio wrote: ‘Eyes are on an industry
that season after season watches design houses consistently use one or 
no models of colour. No matter the intention, the result is racism.

Both Iman and Naomi - pictured here in 2001 - say that there were more black models on the catwalk when they were in their hey day of modelling in the 70s

'Not
accepting another based on the colour of their skin is clearly beyond 
“aesthetic” when it is consistent with the designer’s brand.

'Whether 
it’s the decision of the designer, stylist or casting director, that 
decision to use basically all white models, reveals a trait that is 
unbecoming to modern society.

‘It
can no longer be accepted, or confused by the use of an Asian model. As
of last season, below are the fashion houses guilty of this racist 
act.’

A group of fashion professionals issued an open letter to Fashion Week councils listing the designers that they said used only one or no black models in last season's runway shows, including Victoria Beckham

The letter goes on to list both men’s and womenswear labels.

Last
night Miss Campbell appeared on Channel 4 News to appeal for change in 
the industry.

She said: ‘What we are asking for is that you are based on
your talent, on your beauty... Not on the colour of your skin.’

When 
asked if she was accusing the industry of being racist, Miss Campbell 
said: ‘I’m saying the act of not choosing models of colour, is racist.

'We’re not calling them racist, we’re saying the act was racist.’

A spokesman for Mrs Beckham declined to comment on the open letter last night.

Supermodels want to see more black models on runway

Say there were far more in the 1970's when they started out

@highlight

Both maintain that the 'act' of not choosing black models is racist, rather than designers themselves

Chanel, Marc Jacobs and Victoria Beckham are called out as having used 'one or no models of colour' last season
