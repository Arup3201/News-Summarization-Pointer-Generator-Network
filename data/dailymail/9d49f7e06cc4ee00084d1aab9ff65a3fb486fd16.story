The decision to put six Birmingham schools in special measures 'to protect children from extremism' was dismissed as 'plain old Islamaphobia' by a senior teacher at one of the academies today.

Lee Donaghy - the assistant head of the city's Park View School  - attacked the way his school had been portrayed by Ofsted inspectors and Government ministers.

Appearing in front of MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee this afternoon, Mr Donaghy slammed public 'ignorance' of Islam and false allegations that his school segregated children and allowed extremism to fester.

'There’s been a wilful misrepresentation of things that we’ve done and some things have been outright lies,' he added.

His remarks came after education watchdog Ofsted last week published a bombshell report  following allegations of a Trojan Horse plot to radicalise Muslim pupils in British state schools.

The Golden Hillock School and Nansen Primary School were both branded 'inadequate' in the new inspections

Governors at Satley School were accused of  'refusing to accept that the school is in a state of crisis' while governors at Oldknow Academy used the school's budget to subsidise a trip to Saudi Arabia for only Muslim staff and pupils

Tory Lorraine Fullbrook asked Mr Donaghy if he was saying that Ofsted had been 'prejudiced in some way'. Mr Donaghy said: 'Yes.' He also agreed that he had been 'victimised'.

The senior teacher added: 'The way the school has been painted in the media has very little resemblance to the school that I work at.' He said: 'There's no school in the country with our intake that achieves better results.'

Mr Donaghy did admit that the school 'could have done more to vet' the hate preacher Sheikh Shady Al-Suleiman before he was invited to speak at the school - even though he had allegedly previously called for 'victory to the Muslims in Afghanistan'.

The teacher said he only spoke about 'time management, preparing for exams and responsibility to community and family', Mr Donaghy said.

His remarks came after Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw, said 'a culture of fear and intimidation has taken grip' in the schools. 

His report said head teachers had been 'marginalised or forced out of their jobs' by hardline school governors and there was evidence of an 'organised campaign to target certain schools'.

Sir Michael described some of the findings as 'deeply worrying and in some ways quite shocking'.

Education Secretary Michael Gove said hardline Muslim governors had led an 'organised campaign' to change the character of ordinary state schools.

He revealed how one school had played the Muslim call to prayer over loudspeakers in the playground while another had invited hate preacher Sheikh Shady Al-Suleiman to speak even though he had previously called for 'victory to the Muslims in Afghanistan'.

Mr Gove also attacked a school for banning non-Muslim pupils from subsidised school trips to Saudi Arabia and banning a baby Jesus doll from a nativity play.

Inspectors had also revealed how raffles and tombolas at one primary school been banned - because they were considered 'un-Islamic' as they promoted gambling.

It was also revealed that one academy's Christmas special assembly was cancelled and a termly assembly staged by a Christian charity had been scrapped. The terms 'white prostitute' had been used in assemblies.

Education Secretary Michael Gove was forced to apologise to the Home Secretary Theresa May after private remarks criticising her strategy to tackle extremism were reported. Mrs May's furious aides hit back, sparking a Cabinet war 

After the Trojan Horse allegations came to light earlier this year the Education Secretary Michael Gover ordered a probe by the schools inspectors Ofsted.

But the controversy has left David Cameron's Government in crisis after Mr Gove was forced to make a grovelling apology to the Prime Minister for undermining Home Secretary Theresa May, whose spin doctor had to quit for attacking the Education Secretary.

The punishments were meted out after a furious Mr Cameron was compelled to intervene to stop a power struggle between Home Secretary Mrs May and Education Secretary Mr Gove.

Mr Gove agreed to say sorry after private remarks he made criticising her and Home Office counter-terrorism boss Charles Farr over the Home Office’s handling of extremism in schools appeared in the media.

Mrs May’s spin doctor, Fiona Cunningham, was forced to quit for leaking a damaging private letter to Mr Gove written by Mrs May.

The Home Secretary insisted she did not know about the decision to publish the private letter to Mr Gove. 

Following the scandal David Cameron claimed extremism and division was flourishing because of a 'worrying' failure to push British values.

He said he wanted all school pupils to be taught about the Magna Carta and 'British valies'.

Tony Blair said the alleged Islamic extremism in British schools was the same as that practised by Boko Haram, the Nigerian terrorist network.

He said the Trojan Horse 'plot' to bring hardline practices into Birmingham classrooms was part of a global extremist movement stretching from Britain to Africa to the Far East.

The former Prime Minister said: “There is a very fundamental problem that we face, that may have originated in this region but has now spread across the world.

“That problem is extremism based on a warped and abusive view of the religion. It is a problem here in the region. It is a problem in countries like Pakistan, it’s a problem in the Far East. We can see from Nigeria and Boko Haram it’s a problem in African countries and it’s a problem in our own society as we can see from Birmingham schools.”

He added: “We have to assert the strong values of religious respect and tolerance for difference.

“Any politics that is based on a view that ‘This is my religion and if you don’t agree you are my enemy’, that is the ideology we have to attack and root out.”

But some parents have accused Ofsted of looking for extremism.

A governor at Park View School in Birmingham - one of the schools placed in special measures over fears of extremism - has accused Michael Gove and Ofsted boss Sir Michael Wilshaw of 'demonising' Muslims.

David Hughes launched a stinging attack on the Education Secretary and the Ofsted chief inspector over their handling of the case and suggested that they had exploited the situation.

In an open letter to Mr Gove and Sir Michael, Mr Hughes, who is also vice chair of Park View Educational Trust, warned that communities affected by the allegations feel 'frightened, betrayed and let down'.

Mr Hughes wrote: 'We were told we were outstanding, not least in a personal visit from Sir Michael, and courted to set up our multi-academy trust.

'Now we are told we have deteriorated at an alarming rate - yet we are largely the same people, doing what we did previously.

'I find it astounding that you are now so vehement in condemning us as negligent and derelict in our duties at best, and dangerous at worst.'

He added: 'You have some very angry communities now who feel frightened, betrayed and let down by the way you have exploited the Trojan Horse hoax and demonised them. You have my best wishes in dealing with what has been unleashed."

Mr Hughes also insisted there was 'no plot to "Islamise" Park View or to promote the violation of anyone's human rights or to promote extremism'.

A Department for Education spokeswoman said: 'It is right that Ofsted and the DfE investigated the very serious concerns raised about Park View. We would be failing in our duty if we ignored the evidence arising from these investigations and did not intervene.'
