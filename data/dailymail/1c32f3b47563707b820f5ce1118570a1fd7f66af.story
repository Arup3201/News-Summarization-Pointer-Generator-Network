Her blonde hair neatly coiffed and dressed in a chic Bruno Oldfield suit, the Duchess of Cornwall was every inch the royal style icon as she arrived for a service at Westminster Abbey this afternoon.

But for once, the royal wasn't the centre of attention, with that honour going to veterans of the Battle of Britain who had gathered for a thanksgiving celebration to mark the 74th anniversary of the World War II fight.

Standing alongside Prince Charles, the Duchess watched as a Spitfire and a Hurricane performed a fly-past over the cathedral as a mark of remembrance to the men who fought and died in the first major aerial campaign of the war.

The battle, which took place between July and October 1940, was one of the turning points of the war but left 544 RAF pilots and aircrew dead as they fought to save Britain from a German invasion.

The annual service marks the victory bought by a force which, along with Britons, also included men from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, France, Ireland, Jamaica, Newfoundland, New Zealand, Poland, Rhodesia [now Zimbabwe], South Africa and the US.

Having thwarted Germany's invasion plan by stopping the Luftwaffe from controlling the skies over southern England, Winston Churchill memorably declared: 'Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.'

Ever since, those who fought in the battle are proudly known as 'The Few'.

Along with Battle of Britain veterans,
 the congregation also included families of serving soldiers as well as 
the Prince of Wales, who, as the Air Chief 
Marshal of the RAF, wore his full ceremonial uniform, and the Duchess of Cornwall.

An
 RAF line-up plus the Reverend John Hall, the Dean of Westminster, and 
Canon Vernon White greeted the royal upon arrival, ahead of a service which saw a succession of clergymen pay tribute to the bravery of those who fought.

RAF chaplain-in-chief, the Venerable Air Vice Marshal Jonathan Chaffey told the congregation that the battle was a daily routine of 'adrenaline and fear', of 'camaraderie and loss' but also highlighted the strength of the human spirit.

With this in mind, he praised last week's Invictus Games, which were championed by Prince Harry and were backed by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as well as the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall.

An international sporting event for wounded, injured or sick servicemen and women, participants came all over the world, including Afghanistan, Australia and Canada, as well as the UK.

'There was the sacrifice of "The Few" but also the industry and determination of the many, a whole force in a great cause,' added Air Vice Marshal Chaffrey.

'The Battle of Britain deserves a special place in our corporate minds. The competitors in the Invictus Games have sent a powerful message of what can be achieved despite adversity.'
