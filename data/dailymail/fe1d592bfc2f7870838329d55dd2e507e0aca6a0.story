A Florida man proved that you're never quite too old to play golf on Wednesday.

103-year-old Gus Andreone made a hole-in-one at Palm Aire Country Club in Sarasota, Florida perhaps making him the oldest ever man to make a hole-in-one.

 Andreone used a driver from the green tees on the 113-yard No. 14 hole of the Lakes Course.

'I hit it solid and the ball then hit the ground about 30 yards from the green and kept rolling, rolling and rolling,' Andreone said, according to PGA.com.

Oldest man to make a hole-in-one: Gus Andreone of Sarasota, Florida, the oldest member of the PGA of America, said he counts himself among the most blessed golfers

Still has it: Even though Gus Andreone is 103, he constantly has the young players wanting to join him in the game and some even say they feel 'like a teenager' when they play with him 

'It fell into the hole, which was cut on the right middle part of the green. Miracles do happen once in a while.'

Andreone is currently the longest serving PGA member at 75.6 years and was lucky enough to win the Pennsylvania Lottery in the 1970s where he was given $1,000 for the rest of his life.

A seasoned golf player, his first hole in one was made in 1939. This is his eighth ever hole-in-one.

His most recent hole-in-one before Wednesday's win was in the 1990s on the No.17 hole at the Lakes Course.

'Each day is a blessing and you never know what it will bring,' said Andreon to WFLA.

Even though Gus Andreone is 103, he constantly has the young players wanting to join him in the game.

'I'm 83, and I feel like I'm playing a teenager when I play with him,' a fellow golfer told WLFA. 

Andreone started playing golf in the 1920s but courses have changed over the years

He said, 'When you played in the rough, it was rough. You didn't bring out a wood back in those days in the rough I played in. You just were lucky if you found a golf ball.'

Despite the competitive nature of golf Andreone says it's important to find the fun in it.

'Don't forget, golf's a game. You enjoy that. Good or bad, you're doing it.'

He has said his success comes from his positive outlook on life.

'Golf has been good to me all these years and outside three years in the service, that's been my life.'
