The big players have parked their tanks on Wimbledon’s lawns, with Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal both declaring that they are fit and ready to fire over the next fortnight.

The top two seeds issued upbeat assessments of their chances yesterday, with the Serb insisting his wrist is fine and world No 1 Nadal believing he is equipped to avoid the shock exits that have befallen him since 2011.

Djokovic missed last month’s Madrid Open with soreness in his wrist that first appeared at the start of the clay court season  and he pulled out of his regular  pre-Wimbledon exhibition at Stoke Park on Thursday as a precaution.

He feels going into Wimbledon without any preparation on grass has been a price worth paying because easing himself in appears to have cured the problem.

He said: ‘When I was changing surfaces from clay to grass, during the opening few days of practice here, I got a bit of a strange sensation in the wrist. But now it’s fine.’

While Djokovic has been staggeringly consistent at the Grand Slams — he has not lost before the quarter-finals since the French Open five years ago — Nadal has become prone to upsets on the grass.

The Serb took some time off in Ibiza after Roland Garros, while Nadal had some downtime at home in Mallorca before coming to London last Wednesday. They both feel it is the right formula for success and in the Spaniard’s case he believes it will lead to him sticking around longer.

Nadal is so confident about the state of his body he has stepped up his preparations from previous visits to the All England Club.

‘I’m practising more hours than I usually do,’ he said. ‘It’s positive that my physical level gives me that chance because this is the only tournament where you don’t have weeks of matches to understand how you are playing.

‘It’s the most dangerous tournament of the year. When I arrive at Roland Garros I can more or less imagine how I am going to play. Here the courts are a bit faster at the start and the feeling on court is a little strange for everybody.’

Nadal has the toughest initial draw of any top player, facing the useful Slovakian Martin Klizan in the first round, then possibly his 2012 conqueror Lukas Rosol and potentially the giant-serving Ivo Karlovic.

He dismissed any significance in his loss 10 days ago against Dustin Brown in Germany, saying: ‘I am feeling better this year than the past couple. I am able to move more freely, I’m not scared about my knee and that is the most important thing for me.

‘I didn’t play as much as I would like to play on grass for the last couple of years but I am not starting from zero because I have already played a lot on it in my career.

‘But you don’t have much time to control a match on grass, you make two mistakes on your serve and you don’t have much chance to get it back.’

Not wishing to be outdone, Roger Federer was also in confident mood. The great Swiss, who won the German ATP event at Halle, is the fourth favourite for this event as he approaches his 33rd birthday but he questions the relevance of that. ‘I don’t know if it changes a whole lot,’ he said. ‘Sometimes I was the big favourite but if you believe you can win the tournament then you’re just focused on yourself.’

He lost in the second round last year against Sergiy Stakhovsky but now feels able to joke about that result. ‘We can only face each other in the final this year — so it’s all good for both of us,’ he says.

Crucially he believes more in himself at Wimbledon: ‘Maybe in Paris it’s slightly dependent on Rafa. Here I feel if I play my game then it’s more on my racket.’

Don't forget me! Federer may be fourth favourite but he is still a tough opponent on grass
