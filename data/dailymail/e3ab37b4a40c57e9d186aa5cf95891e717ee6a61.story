A former Denver anesthesiologist was sentenced to 20 years in prison Friday after admitting that he bludgeoned an Aspen socialite to death.

William Styler, 66, entered his guilty plea after accepting an agreement with Pitkin County prosecutors.

Prosecutors said Styler killed Nancy Pfister, 57, February 24, striking her with a hammer while she slept.

Case closed: Former doctor William Styler, 66, pictured in court back in March, was sentenced to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to murdering Aspen socialite Nancy Pfister

Lone suspect: Styler (left), a former anesthesiologist from Denver, had told authorities he acted alone in the murder of Pfister, whose house he and his wife had been renting while the socialite was away

The former doctor then wrapped the victim's body and hid it in a closet, where she was found by police two days later.

Pfister had rented her home to Styler and his wife while she vacationed in Australia. She was killed shortly after she returned to Aspen. Pfister's parents co-founded the Buttermilk ski area.

On a Facebook posting before her death, Pfister said that the Stylers were not paying rent. Defense attorneys denied that claim.

But District Attorney Sherry Caloia told reporters Friday that Styler and Pfister had argued before the murder. Caloia also suggested that the motive may have been a financial dispute.

Styler, his wife, Nancy Styler, and Pfister's personal assistant, Katherine Carpenter, originally were charged with first-degree murder.

Prosecutors dropped the charges against Nancy Styler on Tuesday and against Carpenter on Friday. Caloia said Friday that William Styler had told authorities he acted alone in the slaying.

At sentencing, Pfister's relatives asked Chief District Judge James Boyd to impose a maximum sentence of 32 years for the second-degree murder charge.

Prosecutors recommended a 20-year term in a prison with medical facilities, and Boyd agreed.

Styler had appeared in court in a wheelchair for an unspecified health condition.

‘We do believe that this is a good and
 just resolution to these cases and hope that Nancy Pfister's family can
 find peace in knowing what happened,’ said a statement issued by 
Caloia's office.

Citing Styler's age and health, it added, ‘We believe this will be a life sentence for him.

The Stylers' arrest affidavits that were unsealed last week showed that police found nine blood spots inside the couple's Jaguar, ABC News reported.

The murder weapon was discovered in a trash bag not far from Nancy and William Stylers' hotel room.

Nancy Pfister, 57, was hit with a hard object that had a small, curved shape and died from a blunt force trauma to the head, according to the coroner's report released in April. 

She had been dead about 36 hours before her body was found on February 26.

William and Nancy Styler, who had rented Pfister's Aspen home while she was in Australia, were arrested March 3 after moving out of the residence February 22.

Katherine Carpenter, 56, an assistant to Pfister and a bank employee, was arrested March 14.

Authorities said she called 911 to report she found Pfister's body in a closet of the home.

Pfister
 was the daughter of the late Betty and Art Pfister, longtime prominent 
Aspen residents who co-founded the Buttermilk ski area west of town. 
Buttermilk Mountain has hosted the Winter X Games multiple times.

Pfister's death was the first homicide case in Pitkin County in 12 years, not counting those classified as murder-suicides.

Pfister wrote on Facebook on February 3 
that 'the people that were supposedly taking care of my house are not 
doing what they said they would do and they're not paying rent and they 
haven't paid utilities'.

Over the years, Pfister had paid 
Carpenter, an employee at two Alpine bank branches in Aspen, to manage 
her property and to walk her dog, Gabe, who came with the $4,000-a-month
 lease.

On February 6, 
Pfister posted on Facebook that she was looking for new tenants and that
 anyone interested should contact Carpenter.

Ms Pfister, pictured left with her daughter Juliana, wrote on Facebook that she was returning early from Australia as she was having trouble with tenants who were not paying the rent

She subsequently returned from Australia and, days later, was found dead by Carpenter.

Juliana Pfister attended those 
proceedings surrounded by friends, telling ABC News that she couldn't 
believe someone would kill her fun-loving mother because of an alleged 
rent dispute.
