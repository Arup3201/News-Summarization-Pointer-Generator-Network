Greek striker Kostas Mitroglou has ended his Fulham nightmare, at least temporarily, by returning on loan to former side Olympiacos.

Mitroglou flew to Athens on Sunday to undergo talks with the Greek champions before joining his former side on a season-long loan.

Fulham will secure a loan fee thought to be in the region of £2.5m  for the striker.

Reputation: Mitroglou was signed by Fulham for £12.4million in January but struggled during his time in London

The move will come as a relief to Mitroglou, who has endured a horrible run of luck since moving to West London for £12.4million in January

The 26-year-old arrived with a huge reputation having netted three hat-tricks during the first half of last season for Olympiacos and having sealed Greece's qualification to the World Cup in Brazil.

Yet a succession of injuries and loss of form ensured Fulham boss Felix Magath rarely gave Mitroglou the opportunity to impress.
