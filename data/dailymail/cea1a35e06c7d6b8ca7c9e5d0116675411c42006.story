A 95-year-old retired headteacher will become the oldest person to stand trial in Britain after he denied a string of sexual offences dating back over half-a-century.

Jack Mount, who was born in 1919, faces 50 counts of abusing children over a 25 year period, between 1953 and 1979.

The former head of the privately-run Brookside School, near Craven Arms, Shropshire, faces nine charges of rape, seven of indecency with a child, 20 of indecent assault, and 14 other serious sexual assault charges.

Retired headteacher Jack Mount, 95, has denied 50 historic sexual offences dating back over half a century

The alleged offences involve 17 victims, both boys and girls, in South Shropshire, Barnsley, and Birmingham.

All the complainants were aged between seven and 13 when they claim they were abused by Mount, who lives in South Molton, Devon.

Mount, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, appeared at Birmingham Crown Court on Friday afternoon for a plea and case management hearing.

The pensioner, wearing a tweed jacket and green jumper with a brown tie, pleaded not guilty to all 50 counts which were put to him during the 25-minute hearing.

The OAP was released on bail by His Honour Judge Melbourne Inman QC, the Recorder of Birmingham, but a date was not set for his next court appearance.

'In my judgement the case should be tried nearer to where Mr Mount resides.

The alleged offences were said to have taken place at the privately-run Brookside School, near Craven Arms, Shrops, between 1953 and 1979

'I put a full account together before Christmas but I haven't been told where it will be tried.

'So I am not setting a date now. Adjourning this case, unusually, I can't give a specific date but will try to get a trial date set as soon as possible.'

Mount, who will be 96 by the time a trial is expected to start in the summer, was allowed to sit at the back of the court, rather than in the dock, since he is hard of hearing.

Prosecutor Maria Karaiskos said: 'There is to be a total of 17 complainants for the trial.'

Benjamin Williams, defending, said: 'It is expected that the trial will last eight weeks. The defendant may only be able to sit for half a day at a time.'
