A friend of the prime suspect in the case of Kyron Horman who has been missing for two years, refused to answer 142 questions related to his disappearance, pleading the Fifth Amendment, it was revealed today.

Kyron Horman went missing from Skyline School on June 4, 2010, and his stepmom Terri Horman was named in a civil suit as the prime suspect because she was the last person to see him.

Now, Kyron's biological mother Desiree Young - who divorced father Kaine before their son vanished - has asked a judge to force Terri's friend to answer all of the questions put to her during a deposition taken earlier this month.

DeDe Spicher was uncooperative during questioning - even refusing to identify a picture of her friend, whether she knew her husband and if she had ever met Kyron - in the $10million civil suit filed by Young.

Refusal: Desiree Young has asked a judge to force DeDe Spicher to answer all of the questions put to her during a deposition taken earlier this month in which Spicher asserted her Fifth Amendment right to every one

Multnomah
County sheriff's investigators looking into the disappearance of Kyron 
Horman were interested in the whereabouts of Spicher on that day.

Court
documents say she was at work that day but left abruptly at 11.30am and 
returned 90 minutes later. She declined to say what she did during that 
time.

'Are you aware that Kyron Horman has disappeared?' asked Young's lawyer, Elden Rosenthal.

'I'm
asserting my Fifth Amendment right,' Spicher replied, according to a 
transcript filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court obtained by The 
Oregonian. 

She even refused
to identify a picture

His mother Desiree has now filed a motion asking the court to compel Spicher to answer the questions.

Lawyer
Elden Rosenthal noted that  the Fifth Amendment provides that 'no 
person...shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against
himself.'

'Plaintiff 
believes that Ms Spicher has inappropriately sought the protection of 
the privilege against self-incrimination," he wrote. 'The privilege is 
personal; it cannot be used to protect another person...Otherwise, the 
privilege could be used as a shield to protect a witness' friends, and 
to deny a civil litigant probative evidence.

'A witness may not invoke the Fifth Amendment in order to hide knowledge of a friend's criminal conduct.'

After Kyron disappeared, authorities searched the condo Spicher was working at on June 4.

In
2010, investigators also put out a flier with Spicher's photos on it, 
asking if anyone noticed her or Terri Horman between 9:45 a.m. and 1 
p.m. on June 4, 2010.

The suit Ms Young filed asks the judge to order Horman to return Kyron or, if he is dead, reveal where his remains are located.

In his ruling, Judge Kantor wrote: ‘Witnesses and evidence may disappear. Memories may fade. The opportunity to find Kyron alive or dead, lessens.’ 

Ms Young accused Horman of knowing what happened to Kyron. She told the East Idaho News in June: ‘I believe that Terri Horman knows where Kyron is. I believe that Terri Horman is responsible for where my son is.’

According to NWCN.com, Horman was the last to see Kyron alive. Ms Young’s civil suit accuses her of kidnapping him from Skyline Elementary.

Following Judge Kantor’s decision, the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office released a statement that stated the civil case was separate from the continuing criminal investigation against Horman.

The statement read: 'While there may be rulings regarding the court's opinions as to how the case may proceed, these rulings/legal opinions are part of the civil court case. The civil case is a process that is independent of the active, on-going criminal investigation being conducted by the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office.

Investigators have long focused on Horman, although until this point, had not named her as a suspect or filed criminal charges.

When the lawsuit was filed on June 1, Young's attorney, Elden Rosenthal, said it would be on a 'parallel track' with the criminal investigation.

He would not say what kind of reaction the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office gave when he informed them of Young's decision to sue.

Horman believes the suit is working to advance the aims of local law enforcement. She points out that the judge hearing her divorce from Kyron's father, Kaine Horman, delayed that case while the criminal investigation plays out.

'Plainly and simply, Young's lawsuit is a quest for information to move the criminal investigation forward and to taint any jury pool,' according to the filing.

Civil allegations require a lower standard of proof — a preponderance of evidence — than criminal charges, which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

Compelling her to testify, Bunch wrote, could force Terri Horman to invoke her constitutional right against self-incrimination, pointing out the weak spots in her case.

'The burden on Horman of being required to participate in this lawsuit before the district attorney and police have completed their investigation squarely jeopardizes her constitutional rights,' Bunch wrote.

'We've racked our brains trying to think 
of reasons why. We cannot come up with anything. It’s like a portal 
opened up in the school and Kyron just vanished into it.'

-Biological mother Desiree Young

According to local news reports at 
the time of his disappearance, Horman took her stepson to a science fair
at the school that Friday morning.

Initial sheriff’s reports said that Horman saw Kyron walking off to his classroom, and judging that he was on his way, left.

The teacher of Kyron’s class didn’t see him at the 10am start, and marked him absent.

His parents were alarmed when Kyron didn’t get off the school bus that afternoon, and called the school. Skyline, in turn, called 911 to report the boy missing.

According to East Idaho News, the police department has spent a collective 28,000 hours searching for him.

Horman’s former husband Kyron Horman first filed a restraining order against her and later divorced her. They have a young toddler together.

Ms Young told Good Morning America in a 2010 interview that her son’s disappearance was ‘a parent’s worst nightmare.’

She said: ‘We’ve racked our brains trying to think of reasons why. We cannot come up with anything. It’s like a portal opened up in the school and Kyron just vanished into it.

‘It’s a mystery.’
