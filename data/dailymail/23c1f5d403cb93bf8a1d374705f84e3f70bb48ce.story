Heavy fog blanketed the country today causing severe disruptions at airports across England and Europe.

More than 120 inbound and outbound flights have been cancelled at Heathrow - the country's busiest airport - with every inbound flight and many outbound flights delayed as pilots battle with visibility problems.

But as the thick fog continues to hang in the air, more flights are likely to be cancelled this evening and tomorrow.

London City Airport and Stansted 
Airport also reported disruption while Newcastle Airport was forced to 
cancel flights because of the weather.

A spokeswoman for Heathrow Airport said airlines were cancelling flights to allow more space between each landing because of the heavy fog, in the same way cars must ensure a safe distance with the vehicle in front.

She added that passengers were being offered alternative flights.

The affects of the heavy fog was felt across Europe, including in Poland where planes due to land at Warsaw airports were redirected to neighbouring cities or were forced to wait for the fog to temporarily dissipate before landing, airport authorities said.

The Met Office has issued a 17-hour severe weather alert for today and tomorrow int he South, Midlands and North of England as visibility drops to 50metres on hills because of the fog.

Famous skylines across the capital were totally obscured by the thick fog, but the weather is expected to warm up before a cold snap greets the country by the end of the week.

Continuing
this year's pattern of wacky weather, it could also bring 'blood rain' 
to our shores - rain carrying red dust from the Sahara desert in time for Halloween.

London City said this morning: ‘Due 
to low visibility this morning, flights to and from London City Airport 
are experiencing disruptions.

‘Passengers are advised to contact their airlines for more information regarding their flight status.’

A
Heathrow spokeswoman said it has cancelled a number of flights to help 
ease pressure on the airport because of the restrictive weather.

Rail passengers also faced a series of delays this morning after a string of broken-down trains and well as signalling problems.

Passengers have been warned to expect further disruption on Tuesday as the problems caused by heavy fog look likely to continue.

A spokesman for Heathrow Airport said operators were expecting more fog. About 1,300 flights are scheduled to serve the airport during the day, split roughly half-and-half between arrivals and departures.

The airport will also have to deal with the knock-on impact of today's disruption, which had seen the cancellation of 136 flights by 7.15pm.

Passengers whose flights were cancelled were being put on later flights, either late on Monday or on Tuesday, the spokesman said.

Departures from the airport were delayed by 45 minutes on average and arrivals were held up by about 10 minutes.

'We have been distributing water to those passengers who unfortunately have had to wait,' the spokesman added.

Gatwick Airport was forced to cancel a 'handful' of flights to the Channel Islands because of the fog, but a spokesman said there had been little disruption generally.

'We have been accepting a small number of flights diverted from other airports to help out,' the spokesman added.

'We would advise passengers to check with their operator for latest information.'

There were no cancellations at Stansted today, although the airport accepted 30 flights which were diverted from other airports, mainly London City, Southend and Luton.

A spokesman for Stansted Airport said: 'There have been minor delays, but nothing that has significantly affected business.

'As for Tuesday, it is a case of waiting and seeing.'

in London as well as hold-ups for First Capital Connect passengers 
between City Thameslink and Blackfriars stations in London.

A broken-down train also led to delays to Northern Rail services between Skipton and Shipley in Yorkshire.

On
the railways, a signalling problem led to delays to services between 
Beckenham Junction and Herne Hill in south east London operated by the by the Southeastern train company.

Southeastern, Arriva Trains Wales and CrossCountry also reported problems across the west of England, Wales and Scotland respectively.

The foggy backdrops of London follow beautiful Autumn scenes in the Lake District captured over the weekend as leaves turned green, red, copper and gold.

The mild conditions are not expected to last, with snow predicted for the end of the week.

Freezing
arctic winds are set to send temperatures plummeting at the end of the 
week, with snow forecast in the north of England and Scotland by next 
weekend.

The Met Weather Office said London 
and the south east will enjoy the hottest weather with temperatures 
soaring to a very warm 20 degrees centigrade on Monday and Tuesday, 
provided cloud lifts.

The
rest of England and Wales will also enjoy the warm spell with 
temperatures hovering in the mid teens, although forecasters say it will
stay cloudy.

The Met Office described how rain carrying dust from the Sahara stains cars when it falls.

'Where
there has been rain in the southeast there has been red dust brought 
down with it. When the rain dries off it leaves a red residue,' a 
spokeswoman said.

'This could last until the early part of the week.'
