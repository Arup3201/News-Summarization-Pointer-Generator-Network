League One Peterborough have parted ways with manager Darren Ferguson following Posh's 3-0 defeat to MK Dons on Saturday.

Ferguson's side found themselves three goals down at half time with William Grigg and Ben Reeves sending the hosts into a commanding position.

The away side made two changes with 35 minutes gone, but it wasn't enough as Peterborough lost the game and Ferguson lost his job on Saturday.

Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony said: ‘We have had over eight incredible years together with tremendous success on and off the field.

‘I will be forever in his debt for the great times, fantastic football and professionalism he has brought to our football club.

‘I also have no doubt that wherever he goes next, it will lead to great success for him and the club he next works for.’

The club has also parted ways with Gary Breen, Gavin Strachan, Jimmy Walker, Stewart England and Marc Lindsey.

Peterborough have won just one of their previous five league games and currently sit 15th in the table – four points off the play off places.

MacAnthony added: ‘It has not been our finest six months results wise or performance wise as a football.

‘Some fans have questioned my own commitment, interest, investment and passion for this football club recently; so to them I say with full sincerity and honesty.

'I am hungrier than ever to get this club back into the Championship and beyond and to deliver on the promises I have made to the city of Peterborough.

‘I won’t stop until we are scoring goals for fun, entertaining our fans, building our fan base and winning promotions once more with a young exciting vibrant squad.’
