Overnight leaders Andy Sullivan and Jbe Kruger experienced wildly contrasting fortunes when the South African Open resumed in Johannesburg on Friday.

England's Sullivan and South African Kruger both carded opening rounds of 66 at Glendower Golf Club to enjoy a one-shot lead over a chasing pack containing tournament host and five-time winner Ernie Els.

But while Sullivan remained in pole position to challenge for his first European Tour title, Kruger crashed down the leaderboard and was facing a battle to make the halfway cut.

Sullivan, who won a trip into space for a hole-in-one during the KLM Open last year, started on the back nine and picked up shots at the 11th, 12th and 17th to improve to nine under par.

That gave the 27-year-old former Walker Cup player a three-shot lead over Denmark's Lasse Jensen, who had set the clubhouse target on six under after adding a 71 to his opening 67, with South African Colin Nel also six under with four holes to play.

Scotsman David Drysdale temporarily reached eight under par before falling back to five under

Scotland's David Drysdale had reached eight under par with four birdies in his first 11 holes, but dropped three shots in four holes from the fourth to fall back to five under.

Kruger - who was second in this event last year - was having a far worse time of it with five bogeys, two double bogeys and a solitary birdie dropping him all the way to two over par and one shot outside the projected cut mark with two holes to play.

Tournament host Ernie Els could not repeat his first round form in his hometown of Johannesburg
