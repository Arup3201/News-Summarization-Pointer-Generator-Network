The driver of a car that smashed through the front of a branch of Wendy's, coming to a stop at the food counter, has been arrested.

As the car smashed through the restaurant's seating area, it narrowly avoided an employee who had been sitting in a booth.Â 

Two men - a customer and employee - were immediately taken to hospital after the SUV crashed into a branch of Wendy's in 
Lanham, about 15 miles outside Washington DC, at 8.50pm on Friday.

Chairs and tables were knocked flying in the crash, and the window frame was left hanging precariously from its fittings.

'I was making sandwiches and then I heard a squeaking sound, then I saw the car and I heard a loud noise,' Wendy's employee Isioma Obima told NBC4. 'I just can't believe it.'

None of the customers or staff were 
believed to have serious injuries, but one of the women who worked at 
the American diner was also taken to hospital later that night, 
suffering from anxiety.

Another employee said she thought the oven had exploded when she heard the car smash into the restaurant, according to CBS DC.

Wendy's, which became the second-best hamburger chain in the U.S. last year, with $8.5 billion sales, has about 5,900 restaurants across the country.

Officer Nicole Hubbard, of Prince Georges County Police, said the driver, who has not yet been named, was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence.
