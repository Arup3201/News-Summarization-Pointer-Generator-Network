When you look at Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, you know immediately they are football superstars.

But with his shirt untucked and socks round his ankles, Thomas Muller looks more like a schoolboy playing in the playground. But make no mistake, he is absolutely lethal.

UNORTHODOX TALENT

There is a beautiful ugliness to Muller’s game. Sometimes his touch can be scrappy and he doesn’t go for fancy tricks, but he’s so effective. How many times does he pop up in the right place at the right time? That doesn’t happen by accident — he is aware of where he needs to be and does whatever it takes to get there.

TOP TECHNICIAN

As well as reading the game so well, Muller has the technique to go with it. He is quick, strong and good with both feet; he can just as easily bend one in the top corner as scuff one in from close range. He’s good in the air, holds the ball up well and brings team-mates into the game. A manager’s dream.

TEAM PLAYER

Muller is unique in that you don’t really know his best position. He’s not quite a striker, not quite a winger. You could play him as a No 10 or an old-fashioned inside-forward. But wherever he ends up he’s dangerous.

How would England use a player like that? Because he doesn’t catch the eye and his skills aren’t as apparent, he might not even get a chance. Credit Germany for getting the best out of such a versatile player.

WORKAHOLIC

One thing you are guaranteed is a huge amount of effort. Even if things aren’t coming off, he gives everything for his team and it rubs off on the rest of the side. Their work ethic is fantastic.

WORLD CUP WONDER

It's the pinnacle of the game, so you don’t score 10 goals in two tournaments without being something special. Muller was young player of the tournament and Golden Boot winner in South Africa and is one game away from being player of the tournament in Brazil. Muller’s one of those players who thrives on this kind of pressure. He is a tournament specialist and he is clearly enjoying himself in Brazil.

RECORD-BREAKER

Miroslav Klose just broke the all-time World Cup scoring record with 16. Muller is only 24 but he’s already got 10. That is an unbelievable achievement and I fully expect him to go on and beat his  team-mate’s record.
