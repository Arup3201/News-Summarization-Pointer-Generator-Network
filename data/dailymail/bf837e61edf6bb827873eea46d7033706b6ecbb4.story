Hundreds of mourners turned out in brightly coloured clothing and onesies yesterday to pay their respects to a teenage girl who was found hanged after being bullied by internet trolls.

More than 400 people gathered to celebrate the life of Hannah Smith, 14, whose body was  found in her bedroom by her 16-year-old sister Jo two weeks ago.

Hannah’s family said the teenager endured months of torment on controversial question-and-answer site Ask.fm.

The website was due to publicise plans to deal with online bullying but postponed the announcement because it coincided with yesterday’s funeral.

Reverend Charlie Styles, who led the service at St Mary’s Church in Lutterworth, Leicestershire, said the tone of the funeral was one of celebration.

The congregation later released purple and white balloons into the grey skies after a countdown of ‘1-2-3 – goodbye’.

Mr Styles said: ‘It was a really lovely service with lots of smiles. The atmosphere was really positive. There were obvious tears and it was quite heartbreaking really to hear, especially some of the younger people, some of Hannah’s friends sobbing. But the overall tone of the service, and the tone really of today, was a feeling of celebration and laughter even amidst the tears.’

Poignant: Hannah's coffin, carried by her father and friends, was coloured purple with the message 'I love you'

The family had requested mourners wear colourful clothing and onesies.

Hannah’s
father, David Smith, dressed in a blue T-shirt and jeans, was among 
those carrying her purple coffin, with ‘I love you’ written on the side,
out of a blue Audi Q7 in heavy rain.

Her
sister Jo walked behind, consoled by her stepmother, Deborah Smith. In 
the church, purple and white balloons lined the aisles and a poster 
reading ‘Be happy for Hannah’ hung from a lectern with a picture of the 
teenager.

Mr Styles 
said that Mr Smith had asked for any donations to go to a local 
anti-bullying group which had helped Hannah’s family since her death.

Remembrance: The service included some of Hannah's favourite songs, left, and outside a poster hung which encouraged mourners to 'be happy for Hannah', right

During the service, there were 
readings by Nora Parker, headteacher of Lutterworth High School, and 
Hannah’s cousin, Ben Hubbard.

Say It Right by Nelly Furtado, one of the teenager’s favourite songs was also played.

Hannah’s
coffin was carried out to One Step Beyond by Madness before the 
congregation gathered on the grass outside the church carrying purple 
and white balloons from inside.

Mr Smith, 45, a 
lorry driver, has called on Prime Minster David Cameron to regulate 
social networking websites to help protect children.

Specsavers, Vodafone, Laura Ashley, EDF 
Energy and charity Save the Children all pulled adverts from Ask.fm in 
the aftermath of the schoolgirl's death.

An independent review, set up in to 
the social networking site’s safety features, was due to report its 
findings today - just hours after Hannah’s service, however it was 
delayed until Monday by lawyers acting on behalf of Ask.fm.

In
a statement released by founders Mark and Ilja Terebin, the 
Lativan-based company said: 'It has come to our attention today that 
Friday 16th August, the funeral of Hannah Smith is being held.

'We
have decided, as a mark of respect to Hannah, her family and their 
grief, that we will delay any announcement until Monday 19th August.'

Mr Smith has called for an immediate change in the law to protect vulnerable youngsters and to prevent further tragedies.

He
said he would like to see people held accountable for their actions 
online and, if they are abusing others, they should be identified and 
punished.
