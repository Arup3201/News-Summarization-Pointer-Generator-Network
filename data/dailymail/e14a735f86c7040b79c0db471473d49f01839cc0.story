A turkey running on a treadmill isn’t something you see every day - or at all.

But, a researcher has been putting the animals through their paces to try and find out the science behind running.

And he claims the results will not only reveal more about how the birds' muscles work, his research could also apply to humans.

The turkey on a treadmill experiment is being run by Dr Thomas Roberts from Brown University in Rhode Island.

He told MailOnline the purpose of the experiment was to understand how muscles function to move the body around.

Forget robots designed to look like humans, in the future machines are more likely to resemble ostriches or dinosaurs.

Scientists believe the efficient way flightless birds - and their ancestors - move around on two legs could usefully be employed in robot design.

A study last month demonstrated how an ostrich's speed, energy conservation and ability to stay upright is unmatched in other animals, including humans.

'Birds appear to be the best of bipedal terrestrial runners, with a speed and agility that may trace back 230 million years to their dinosaur ancestors,' said lead researcher Dr Jonathan Hurst, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Oregon State University.

‘Even seemingly simple activities that we take for granted, like walking, involve dozens of muscles performing complex mechanical actions, and incredibly coordinated pattern of neural control, and some involved physics as well,’ he said.

His goal is to understand how the whole process works, and he claims turkeys are an excellent model to understand how muscles power movement.

In addition, they can be very tame and are easy to keep, while the wild strain of turkeys are good runners.

Certain breeds are able to run a mile in about six minutes, and sometimes even faster.

He admits he’s ‘not particularly interested in turkeys,’ but rather how their movements can be applicable to humans.

‘Understanding how turkeys move can help us understand how people move, because the physical challenges are much the same - we all have to support our body against gravity, for example - and our muscles work in the same way,’ he said.

Dr Roberts' research could apparently help us understand how muscles make bodies move. And it is not just applicable for turkeys, but for humans as well (stock image shown). 'Our discovery of the energy-saving role of springs in turkeys has since been observed in humans muscles,' he said

‘For example, our work on turkeys has shown that the springy behavior of tendons allows the animals to essentially “bounce” along the ground when they run, just as someone would bounce on a pogo stick.

'This reduces the work muscle must do and may protect the muscles from the kind of damage that causes muscle soreness.

'Our discovery of the energy-saving role of springs in turkeys has since been observed in humans muscles.

'Springs are now an essential part of the design of the most sophisticated limb prosthetics, and this design was inspired in part by animal studies that show the usefulness of springs in movement.

'And the study of animal models includes some seemingly odd behavior, such as researchers training turkeys to run on treadmills.'
