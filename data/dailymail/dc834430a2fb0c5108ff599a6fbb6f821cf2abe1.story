Drop: Private sector wages in Europe have fallen faster than almost everywhere else in Europe

Wages in Britain have fallen faster than almost everywhere else in Europe, analysis shows.

Private sector pay dropped 3.2 per cent between autumn 2010 and autumn last year after taking account of inflation, it found. Only the Netherlands, Cyprus and Greece fared worse.

The analysis by the House of Commons Library for the Labour Party used UK figures and those of EU statistics arm Eurostat.

It bears out recent Eurostat findings that UK living standards are falling. The figures show German private sector wages have gone up by 2.4 per cent since 2010 and those in Austria by 2.3 per cent. Sweden and the Czech Republic saw gains of 3.4 and 3.3 per cent respectively.

The biggest improvements were in Bulgaria and Romania, up by 12.2 per cent and 5.8 per cent.

However the two newest European countries continue to have the lowest pay levels in the EU, and the increased standards do nothing to change the 'pull factor' of wealth western economies like that of Britain to their workers when their citizens acquire freedom to work in Britain next year.

These figures show just how far Britain is falling behind the rest of Europe under this government.

Late last year an official analysis found that the amount a typical household is able to pay to cover all its necessities and luxuries has dropped by nearly 10 per cent since the onset of the recession.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: 'We are losing in the global race. Families, pensioners and businesses cannot afford another two years of falling living standards.

'A flatlining economy under David Cameron
and George Osborne over the last two years has made British people 
worse off, but families, pensioners and businesses cannot afford another
two years of falling living standards.'

He added: 'Urgent action is needed in the Budget to kick-start our stagnant economy and help people on middle and low incomes struggling with the rising cost of living.

'David Cameron and his downgraded 
Chancellor must heed the warnings and act or Britain will face more 
years of falling living standards and more long-term damage to its 
economy.'

Chancellor George Osborne is under pressure to take measures to improve growth in his Budget later this month, and there is a growing backbench demand for tax cuts.

However, ministers are now squabbling publicly over whether the spending of their departments should be cut.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond called this weekend for cuts to 
benefits and welfare spending to protect defence from further 
sacrifices.

The figures underline the deepening pressure on ordinary families brought by the recession and the Coalition's inability to improve living standards.

They will deepen David Cameron's troubles in the aftermath of the disastrous Tory performance in the Eastleigh by-election and the fractured response to it of Tory figureheads.

Late last year an official analysis found that the amount a typical household is able to pay to cover all its necessities and luxuries has dropped by nearly 10 per cent since the onset of the recession.

An average home in Britain had almost Â£50 a week less to spend last year than it did in 2006, once inflation has been taken into account, according to that breakdown from the Office for National Statistics.
