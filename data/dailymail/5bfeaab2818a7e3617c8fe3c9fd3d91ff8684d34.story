The mascot of a major league baseball team is in hot water after photographed holding up a sign described by officials as inappropriate and offensive.

The Tampa Bay Rays mascot, Raymond, was seen holding the fan-made sign that mocks the death of Steve Irwin during Wednesday night's game in Florida, leading to an official apology by the team.

The sign shows the Crocodile Hunter's name struck through as part of the Rays ‘to do list,’ along with a gasping photo of the late wildlife expert who was killed by a stingray barb in 2006.

'I love Steve Irwin but come on, it's funny,' Lloyd Johnson, a 29-year-old Army veteran who designed the sign told the New York Daily News.

During the Rays' game Johnson said he handed the mascot the sign who after reviewing it, stood on some chairs to show it off to the rest of those around them.

'...obviously [he] thought it was funny because he stood up on the chairs and held it up for literally 3 seconds, obviously realizing what he was doing or when he saw the reaction from some of the fans, and got down and tried to hand it back,' Johnson told DeadSpin in an email after.

Johnson says reaction around him to the sign was generally positive, and still is.

'Every time I stood up I was stopped to take a picture with someone. I probably took 20-30 photos with people,' he said of that game.

'The reaction, at least from what I heard at the stadium and on Facebook, was positive.'

The team had other thoughts, releasing a statement that apologized for what they called an 'inappropriate' mistake.

'Last night Rays mascot Raymond was handed an inappropriate sign brought to the game by a fan,' it read. 'Fans are welcome to bring signs into Tropicana Field provided they are not offensive. The Tampa Bay Rays regret that this particular sign was displayed in the ballpark, and we apologize for the lapse in judgment.'

Johnson said a ticket agent reviewed his sign before he entered the stadium, but doesn't think the man understood it before handing it back.

But Johnson, who's studying sports management and marketing, reveals this wasn't his first homemade sign taken to game.

He previously created a sign for a Denver Broncos game that substituted Irwin's name with Christopher Reeve's.

Reeve became a quadriplegic after being thrown from a horse in 1995.
