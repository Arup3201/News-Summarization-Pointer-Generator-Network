Publishing giant HarperCollins has apologised for omitting Israel from an atlas and has vowed to destroy any remaining copies.

A spokesman said the company 'regrets' the omission from the Collins Middle East Atlas and has removed it from sale. All remaining stock will be pulped.

HarperCollins was criticised for not labelling the country on the map - bought by English-speaking schools in the majority-Muslim Gulf, while clearly marking Gaza and Jordan.

Collins Bartholomew, the subsidiary of HarperCollins, had told The Tablet that including Israel would have been 'unacceptable' to their customers in the Gulf and the amendment incorporated 'local preferences'. 

But in a statement, a spokesperson told MailOnline: 'HarperCollins regrets the omission of the name Israel from their Collins Middle East Atlas.

Omitted: The map in the Collins Bartholomew atlas, sold to English-speaking schools in the majority-Muslim Gulf, omits Israel

'This product has now been removed from sale in all territories and all remaining stock will be pulped. 

'HarperCollins sincerely apologises for this omission and for any offence caused.' 

Bishop Declan Lang, chairman of the Bishops' Conference Department of International Affairs, told The Tablet: 'The publication of this atlas will confirm Israel's belief that there exists a hostility towards their country from parts of the Arab world.

'It will not help to build up a spirit of trust leading to peaceful co-existence.' 

US-based HarperCollins Publishers is  is a subsidiary of News Corp, whose executive chairman, media mogul Rupert Murdoch, is famously pro-Israel.

But HarperCollins has put the omission down to a genuine error. 

A spokesman said: 'HarperCollins regrets the omission of the name Israel from their Collins Middle East Atlas.

'This product has now been removed from sale in all territories and all remaining stock will be pulped. HarperCollins sincerely apologises for this omission and for any offence caused.' 

But the decision to omit Israel on the map has sparked anger on social media, with some Twitter users calling for the boycott of HarperCollins. 

Dr Jane Clements, director of the Council of Christians and Jews, told The Tablet: 'Maps can be a very powerful tool in terms of de-legitimising "the other" and can lead to confusion rather than clarity. 

'We would be keen to see relevant bodies ensure that all atlases anywhere reflect the official UN position on nations, boundaries and all political features.' 

Maps which recognise Israel include Google Maps, Apple Maps, MapQuest, National Geographic, Peters World Map, Yahoo! Maps and Lonely Planet. 

New York-based HarperCollins  is one of the world's leading English-language publishers.

It is a subsidiary of News Corp, whose executive chairman, Rupert Murdoch, is famously pro-Israel.

In the past, the media mogul has taken to Twitter to show his support for the war-torn country.
