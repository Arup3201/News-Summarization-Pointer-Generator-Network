Behind bars: Adam Khan Ahmadzai was at the very heart of the looting and rioting in Croydon last August, according to the Attorney General

A riot ringleader who was at the heart of last year’s Croydon disorder had his sentence of four years detention nearly doubled today because it was too lenient.

Adam Khan Ahmadzai, 20, attacked police, robbed, pillaged and looted during a shocking orgy of ‘mayhem and carnage’ during last August’s mass disorder.

He was given 48 months in a young offender institution when he appeared at Inner London Crown Court in January.

But Attorney General Dominic Grieve 
referred the case to the Court of Appeal on the basis that the total 
sentence imposed for offences of violent disorder, robbery, burglary and
criminal damage on the evening of August 8, 2011 was unduly lenient.

Today,
the Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge, sitting with Mr Justice Openshaw and
Mr Justice Irwin, agreed and said it should be increased to seven 
years.

Lord Judge said: ‘These were offences of great seriousness.’

The
Attorney General, who presented the case to the court, said later: 
‘Adam Khan Ahmadzai was at the very heart of the looting and rioting in 
Croydon last August.

‘Consider
the extraordinary list of crimes that he committed: he led an attack on
a police line; robbed a bus driver who he had forced to halt; armed 
himself and ransacked a shop, forcing the petrified owners to flee, only
to rob them moments later in a hijack of their van; repeatedly attacked
and mugged a terrified man at a cash machine, acting as if pushing a 
gun into his neck; led a gang into a supermarket, looting and 
vandalising; and finally directed his group into a betting shop, 
destroying a fruit machine and looting the office behind the counter.

Lives at risk: Images from the rioting in Croydon became iconic of the mass violence and crime committed across London

'Mayhem and carnage': Adam Khan Ahmadzai, 20, led an attack on a police line; robbed a bus driver who he had forced to halt; armed himself and ransacked a shop during an orgy of criminality which left Croydon devastated

‘For this catalogue of mayhem and 
carnage he received a four-year sentence. I’m very pleased that the 
Court of Appeal has today quashed that sentence and replaced it with one
of seven years.’

CPS London
chief crown prosecutor Alison Saunders said: ‘We referred this case to 
the Attorney General as one that had attracted a sentence which was 
unduly lenient.

'Unduly lenient': Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC took action to increase Ahmadzai's sentence because it was too lenient

‘I welcome the strong message that the Court of Appeal has now sent out as a result of this ruling.

‘Adam
Khan Ahmadzai was a ringleader during the riots in Croydon and his 
conviction for 10 offences committed that night shows the extent of his 
criminality.

‘His offences 
were amongst the most serious which CPS London has prosecuted in 
relation to the summer riots and this increased sentence reflects that.’

Ahmadzai,
of Feltham, west London, buried his head in his hands as he sat in the 
dock of the court while Lord Judge recounted the ordeal of a convenience
shop owner, who was beaten up in front of his wife and and saw his 
business ransacked.

When the couple tried to escape in their van, they were both pulled out of the vehicle and a knife was held to his stomach.

Lord
Judge said the man had moved into Croydon to make a fresh start and 
build a new life in the community, and that was beginning to happen 
before the riots.

But what 
had happened had affected him more than he ever thought possible, so he 
had pulled out of the business and was now unemployed and in great 
financial difficulty.

This offence on its own was of the ‘greatest possible seriousness’, he added.

Ahmadzai, who used a brick, a wooden and a
metal pole, a hammer and a waste bin as weapons, had pleaded guilty in 
the context of his identification on CCTV footage and from blood found 
on the cash machine.

Wrecked: Croydon saw some of the fiercest violence and disorder during the London riots, with an entire row of shops and buildings on London Road, Croydon, gutted after widespread looting and arson

The judges went on to dismiss an 
appeal against a five-and-a- half-year prison sentence imposed on 
23-year-old Zac Challinor for offences of arson, burglary and violent 
disorder in the riots in Manchester on August 9 last year.

Challinor,
of Wythensawe, Manchester, was part of mob violence which left 49 
police officers injured and resulted in a BBC Radio Manchester van being
torched in Salford Shopping City, causing £60,000 damage.

Confronted with CCTV footage, he admitted his guilt and expressed disgust at what he had done.

Rejecting
the appeal, Mr Justice Openshaw said the sentence handed down at 
Manchester Crown Court in January was severe, as intended to be, but not
manifestly excessive.
