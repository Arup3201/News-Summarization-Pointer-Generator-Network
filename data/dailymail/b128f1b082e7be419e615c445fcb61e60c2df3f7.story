The Secret Service has announced plans to fly its own drones in restricted airspace over Washington D.C.

The agency, which has been hit by a number of recent high profile security breaches into the White House grounds, has declined to say what the flights are for, nor specifically when they will occur.

But experts have speculated that the Secret Service has developed drones that can be used as surveillance against unmanned aerial vehicles which violate White House airspace but stopped short of saying they now possess weaponized UAVs.

In January, the agency was embarrassed when a small drone piloted by a drunk government employee crash landed onto the White House lawn and recently Paris has been unnerved by a spate of drones seen buzzing the Eiffel Tower, the US Embassy and other key city landmarks.

The January episode highlighted a serious security gap that the Secret Service has so far been unable to plug - how to combat the threat of drones flown over the nation's capital and specifically against the White House.

The United States Secret Service, in conjunction with other inter-agency partners, will conduct a series of exercises involving unmanned aircraft systems, in the coming days and weeks.

Because these exercises will be conducted within the normally flight restricted areas in the Washington D.C. area, they have been carefully planned and will be tightly controlled. In preparation for these exercises the Secret Service has coordinated with all appropriate federal, state and local agencies.

However, some aviation and security experts have expressed concern about the scope of the Secret Service's use of drones.

Michael Drobac, executive director of the Small UAV Coalition told the Washington Times he thinks that the flights are firstly a public relations exercise designed to restore confidence but he is worried about what the agency will do with all the surveillance material it collects.

'The beauty of their exercise is they get to do real-world outdoor operations that will promote safety for the White House, for monuments and for the general public,' said Drobac.

'(But) If the Secret Service uses it inappropriately, I’d be the first to say they have to stop that,” he said. “They’re going to have to disclose what they intend to do at some point, because that’s exactly what it says in the executive order. Agencies have to be transparent.'

The executive order was issued by President Obama in February and governs how any federal agencies using drones keep information gathered.

All agencies wishing to use drones must publish their own guidelines on keeping and gathering the information so that people's privacy is not violated.

'Beyond using it for ways that are invasive to consumer privacy, which they should not do, if they are using it to protect grounds in Washington D.C. that are restricted, I’m for it,' said Drobac.

Secret Service spokeswoman Nicole Mainar issued a 76-word statement to announce the flights, which leads some to believe they are ready to deploy operational drones to combat any threats to the president and his family.

'They’re testing it in the field, as opposed to just testing it at a research station,' said Brendan Schulman, head of the unmanned aircraft systems practice at the New York law firm of Kramer Levin.

'That might suggest that they are closer to an actual functional defense mechanism than the public might think.'
