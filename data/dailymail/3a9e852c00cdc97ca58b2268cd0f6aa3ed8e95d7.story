A 15-month-old girl nearly choked to death when a safety chain on fairground ride wrapped around her neck.

Kyla McMillan, from Hulme, Greater Manchester was enjoying a day out with her family when she almost lost her life.

The toddler was sitting on the swing seat as it spun around when she lost her grip and slipped. A safety chain caught her around the neck and prevented her from falling from the ride.

Her mother Stephanie said Kyla turned red and was coughing and spluttering.

Ms McMillan said she was outraged that staff assured her that Kyla, who is just slightly more than two feet tall, was big enough to safely use the ride.

Children using the ride sit on metal seats and are secured in place by a piece of chain around their waist. Once the chain is fastened, the ride spins around for several minutes.

Little Kyla slipped while sitting on the seat and was held around the neck by the safety chain until she was rescued.

Fortunately Kyla, pictured, was not seriously injured during her ordeal

Ms McMillan said she was angered by the fairground's offer to refund the £6.99 cost of the ride

Ms McMillan was at the Manchester Easter Fair in Rushmore when the incident happened.

She was with her boyfriend Gareth, and children Kyla, Kade, nine and Che, three. You never think these things are going to happen and when they do it’s a mother’s worst nightmare.

Ms McMillan said she thought her daughter was too small to go on the ride but was assured by staff it was safe

According to Ms McMillan: 'She was sat on the swing for a couple of minutes when disaster struck. The chain wrapped fully around her neck and she started to choke.

'Her face was turning red, she was coughing and spluttering, and she started to panic.

'Kyla’s dad and another dad ran over to her and managed to free her. I couldn’t see her and that’s the worse thing for a mother, never knowing if your child is OK.

'I knew she was too small for the ride but I was convinced otherwise. I should have trusted my instincts because mums know best.

'It was a nasty incident and I just hope the people responsible learn from this because I wouldn’t want it to happen to anyone else.'

After the shocking incident, Ms McMillan and the children were too upset to continue with their day out.

She added: 'The way they handled it was disgusting. To give us £6.99 back when she was almost killed is a joke.'

Fun fair manager Krystle Hart said: 'All our rides are approved by the Health and Safety Executive and anually tested.

'The chain is for safety reasons and it did what it was meant to do and stop a child falling.'
