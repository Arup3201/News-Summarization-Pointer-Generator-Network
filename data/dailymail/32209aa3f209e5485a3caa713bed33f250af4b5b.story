A daughter helped grant her dying mother's wish to renew her wedding vows before she passed away.

Mother-of-three Dawn Wood, 48, battled cancer for years and after expressing her desire to have the opportunity to have a second wedding, daughter Chelsea took it upon herself to plan the event as a surprise gift for her parents.

Dawn had first been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006. The lump she’d found had originally been wrongly dismissed as benign and by the time it was diagnosed correctly the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes.

Despite extensive surgery and chemotherapy she was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2011 and had two-thirds of her right lung removed.

Her daughter Chelsea, a hairdresser, from Barnsley, South Yorks, says:  ‘Mum refused to feel sorry for herself, she wasn’t like that.  She was always thinking of everybody else and everyone loved her. 

‘She was the life and soul, loved dancing and karaoke.  

‘After her lung operation she and Dad took over the local pub and it wasn’t long before she was belting out Abba hits louder than anybody.’

But one evening in April last year Chelsea, 22, and her younger sister Lauren, 19, found Dawn collapsed on the bathroom floor.

Says Chelsea: ‘Her mouth was clamped shut and her skin looked grey.  Dad rushed her to hospital and before long, she was awake telling us she was fine.’

Despite surgery and chemotherapy Dawn's cancer continued to spread. Tragically she passed away just days after renewing her vows

However test results showed that the cancer had spread and she had eight brain tumours.

Says Chelsea: ‘I asked her consultant if there was any hope but there wasn’t. They could only offer treatment to give her a bit longer.

‘I was fighting back tears, but Mum smiled and took my hand and said: ” Let’s enjoy the time I have left.’

Dawn continued to fight but soon she was spending most of her time in bed hooked up to an oxygen tank.

Says Chelsea: ‘She was growing weaker and one evening I asked her if there was anything she’d like to do.

'Mum refused to feel sorry for herself, she wasn't like that,' says Chelsea (L-R: Chelsea, Dawn and Lauren)

‘She told me she wanted to renew her wedding vows with Dad for their 25th anniversary.

‘When I told Dad he pointed out it was three years away and we all knew she didn’t have that amount of time left. 

‘My heart was breaking. But in my mind I began to form a plan.’

Keeping it a secret Chelsea rang the local social club and booked it for a few weeks ahead.

She emailed family and friends and her and Lauren booked a vicar and the local chapel.

Chelsea used her own savings to finance her scheme, but as word spread the local community began pitching in too, donating services and items for the event.

Says Chelsea: ‘As a hairdresser I didn’t earn much but I began scrimping and saving for Mum’s big day.

The emotional event saw Dawn and Kevin reaffirming their vows to each other and sharing a first dance again

‘She kept asking me where all my money was going as each week I appeared flat broke.

‘And I was running out of cash, but my step-brother Liam, 26, chipped in what he could.’

The DJ offered to play for free and the buffet and cake cost them next to nothing while Dawn’s best friend Vikki bought the bridesmaid dresses and Chelsea’s boss and her mother provided the flowers and the car.  

Four weeks before the big day they handed Dawn and Kevin an envelope - an invitation to their own wedding.

Dawn wore a full length satin gown with a panel of sparkling diamante for the big day, and even managed to walk down the aisle unaided

Chelsea recalls: ‘Mum was laughing and crying all at the same time she couldn’t believe it, she was thrilled, and so was Dad.

‘We took her out in her wheelchair to shop for her dress.  She chose a one-shouldered full length satin gown with a panel of sparkling diamante - she looked stunning.’

Despite being rushed to hospital a week before the ceremony Dawn convinced her doctors to discharge her the night before her big day, able to attend the service with her oxygen tank.

‘To everyone’s amazement Mum pushed herself up and out of her wheelchair and summoning up all her strength walked up the aisle to where Dad was waiting for her', says Chelsea.

‘They gazed into each other eyes and renewed their vows....in sickness and health...till death do us part.

‘As I looked around I noticed there wasn’t a dry eye in the church.

‘Afterwards at the reception Mum said she wanted to dance, so she did, in her wheelchair as she and dad kissed and hugged to the song: ‘I don’t want to close my eyes,’ by Aerosmith.

‘We’d invited around 250 people and as everyone kept coming up to her she smiled and dazzled throughout.

‘It was so emotional I couldn’t stop crying, but Mum was loving every minute.'

Next day Dawn was rushed back to hospital. Tests showed she’d probably suffered a heart attack during the celebrations but had managed to keep it hidden from her family and friends.

She passed away a few days later with Chelsea, Lauren, Liam, Kevin, and 16 close friends and family by her bedside.

Chelsea says: ‘We miss Mum so much but we know she’s in a better place.

‘And I’m just so glad we were able to fulfill her last wish. In doing so she filled ours too, to make her happy.’
