The wife of the seriously-wounded Army Ranger who made every effort to salute his senior officer while being presented with a Purple Heart has spoken out about the pride she feels about her husband's brave action.

Josh Hargis was thought to be unconscious during the ceremony when all of the sudden he began moving as he appeared to salute the officer.

His wife Taylor was not in the room at the time but her husband's commander sent her a picture of the heart-warming moment, saying that 'grown men began to weep'.

Army Ranger Josh Hargis courageously brought his right hand up to salute during a Purple Heart ceremony at his bedside in intensive care. His comrades thought he was unconscious

Proud: Taylor Hargis has revealed that she is pregnant with Josh's child and she couldn't be more proud of him

The honor of a Purple Heart is not the only good news in the Hargis household as Taylor has now revealed that she is in the 'very early' stages of pregnancy.

'I'm very fortunate that heâ€™s here, that he's still alive and we still get to have our life together,' she told NBC Nightly News.

The photo of her husband showing no sign of concern over his own comfort in order to show respect to his officer has won him fans around the world.

'It moves me to tears. I think that's why it's gotten so much attention because it's moving people. It's just such an amazing thing that he's done and that he did,' she said.

Lucky: Taylor said that she is so happy that they will still be able to have a life together as so many of his colleagues died including four in his same unit

By his side: The Purple Heart ceremony took place in Germany before he was transferred to the United States, where Taylor has been with him in the hospital

'I was just amazed I was just overcome with pride. That's my husband. He's an amazing man.

'Everyone that knows Josh is not surprised, that's just the kind of man he is.'

Hargis has suffered serious leg injuries after a female suicide bomber detonated her explosives in Panjwai last week, killing four of Hargis' comrades. He was on his fourth tour of Afghanistan.

In his effort to make the salute, Hargis battled a neck brace, breathing apparatus and tubes and even competed with a doctor who tried to stop him from moving to complete the mark of respect.

The brave and magnanimous gesture brought tears to the eyes of the 50 grown men and soldiers who had gathered in the room to witness the ceremony.

Inspiration: Josh's wife Taylor has shared the 
picture as it was the commander's hope that it can serve as an inspiration for many others

The simple gesture left a lasting poignant memory for the senior officer, who wanted to share the story of Josh's honor and bravery with the world.

Inspirational: Taylor got choked up with emotion during her interview

A letter from his commander to Taylor explained the gravitas of the occasion.

'I cannot impart on you the level of emotion that poured through the intensive care unit that day,' he wrote in the letter, which she shared on Facebook.

'Grown men began to weep and we were speechless at a gesture that speak volumes about Josh's courage and character.'

The commander wrote that he believes the picture, which he has hanging above his desk, belongs on every news channel and newspaper, adding he 'will remember it as the single greatest event I have witnessed in my ten years in the Army'.

The ceremony was held just prior to Mr Hargis being flown back to Texas, U.S, via Germany, to receive further treatment. Taylor has been at his side ever since.
