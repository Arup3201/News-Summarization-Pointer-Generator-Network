Photographs of naked high school students appeared on a pornographic website, possibly posted by ex-boyfriends out for revenge, police said.

The images - numbering at least six - were of girls who attend the Norwin High School in Pennsylvania.

North Huntingdon Township Police Department has launched an investigation into who posted the pictures online.

Police said the photos came from the girls' Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts

The authorities were called in after a teacher at the school (pictured) heard rumours about the pictures

Police said that the girls were in various states of undress, with some pictures being extremely graphic in nature.

The authorities were called in after a teacher at the school heard rumours about the pictures and alerted the school’s bosses.

Detective Sgt. Jeffrey Bouldin told WTSP.com: ‘He stated that he had been made aware of talk in the school about the specific site that there was potential of Norwin students being posted on this site.’

He added: ‘My understanding is, on this specific site, there's a myriad of ways to actually post to this. Some of them, you can post anonymous, some of them I believe - I have been told through our investigation - there's actually a place on there [for] 'ex-boyfriends'.

‘We have identified some of them and they are minors and they were in various stages of nudity.’

Police said the photos came from the girls’ Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts.

Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Pittsburgh and the FBI have all been notified about the case and may allocate resources to it.

The school said in a statement: ‘Norwin School District principals, teachers, and administrators wish to emphasize the importance of strong parental oversight of their children or teens’ Internet and computer habits. The District also encourages all students to give serious thought to what photos and personal information they share online.

‘Norwin School District has a curriculum that addresses safe online behavior in keeping with the federal Child Internet Protection Act. The curriculum provides age-appropriate learning experiences for all grade levels.’

The website where the photos appeared has been shut down.
