It's a traditional treat enjoyed by generations of children and adults alike, especially at the seaside.

But the demand for ice cream is slowly melting away as consumers are put off by high prices.

Many are also switching to the more healthy option of frozen yoghurt, which is enjoying soaring sales.

Analysts reveal that Britons will eat 27million fewer litres of ice cream this year than in 2007, down 7 per cent.

Demand for ice cream is falling - and many are switching to the more healthy option of frozen yoghurt, which is enjoying soaring sales

Spiralling prices have led to predictions that the slide will  continue over the next five years, falling by another 7 per cent.

Retail experts Mintel suggest total annual ice cream consumption will fall from 374million litres to 324million in the decade from 2007.

This means the nation will be eating at least 500million fewer scoops a year.

Mintel also reported that ice cream prices have soared by more than 25 per cent over the past five years as the prices of sugar and other raw materials have risen.

Higher manufacturing and transport costs have also had an impact, despite heavy advertising and promotion.

Amy Price, Mintel’s senior food  analyst, said: ‘Almost a fifth of  consumers are cutting back because of financial or health reasons.

'Together with the pressure on  consumer incomes, this has gone some way to dampening demand.’

Over the last two years, however, the sales of frozen yoghurt have soared 50 per cent, up from £4million to £6million.

But, despite these gains, it still makes up less than 0.6 per cent of the  £1.1billion frozen treats market.

Frozen yoghurt can be virtually  fat-free and, along with sorbet, is regarded as a healthy alternative  to ice cream.

The boom in frozen yoghurt has been helped by the success of the Yoomoo chain.

Other brands like Yeo Valley, Snogurt and Yog are also doing well.
