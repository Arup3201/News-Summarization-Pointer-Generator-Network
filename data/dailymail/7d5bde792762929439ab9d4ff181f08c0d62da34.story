Harry the four-year-old pooch pushes himself on a skateboard like a pro, and that's just one of this black Labrador and Patterdale Terrier cross's clever tricks.

Owner Christina Farley, 51, of Stubbington, Hampshire, says while Harry started life as a petulant puppy with a serious barking problem he now channels his energy into practicing his stunts.

When paired with a skateboard he knows exactly what to do, first putting all four paws on the deck then pushing off with his back right leg to get rolling.

Owner Christina Farley, 51, of Stubbington, Hampshire, says Harry was a problem pup before he learned tricks

Harry's other talents also include catch a ball with his paws while standing on his rear legs like a meerkat, stacking cups in order of size, getting the post and he also dances on cue.

Christina, a self-employed gardener, has spent around four hours a week for the past three years teaching her dog new tricks.

‘When he was four months old he used to bark excessively and he needed to learn a lot of self-control,' she said.

Harry's favourite trick is to stack these colourful children's cups in order of size

Christina says she takes the cups everywhere they go so Harry can show off his skills

‘I took him to lessons at Canine Communications in Gosport and they said he was like that because he was very intelligent.

‘At first I didn’t believe them but they proved me wrong. He just needed his mind stimulated. Now he does tricks for fun.

'Since he began learning tricks at eight months, Harry has won the national competition My Dog's Got Talent at Paws in the Park in Detling, Kent.

While daredevil skateboarding may look the most fun, grandmother-of-two Christina said his favourite game is stacking cups in order of their size. 

‘We take [the cups] wherever we go so we can show people what he can do,' she said. ‘He is clicker trained so as a reward he gets a click and then a treat, his favourite is liver cake.

‘Harry is currently learning to play a kids grand piano. It's amazing how far he has come. He's a very lovely, energetic dog.’
