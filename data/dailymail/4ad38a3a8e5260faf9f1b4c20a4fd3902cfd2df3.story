The Canterbury Bulldogs have booked themselves a second NRL grand final appearance in three years  with a hard fought victory against the Penrith Panthers.

Tries to James Graham, Josh Jackson and Dale Finucane - with three conversations from Tim Lafai - were enough to see the Dogs progress 18-12 over the men from western Sydney and cement their place against much fancied opponents, the South Sydney Rabbitohs, next Sunday.

Captain Michael Ennis could be in doubt for the ANZ Stadium blockbuster after he left the field at half time with a foot injury, however his absence only made the  gutsy men in blue and white dig deeper in front of a crowd of 46,168.

Penrith set up a thrilling finish when flying winger Dallin Watene-Zelezniak cut the margin to six with eight minutes left, but in the end were left to rue three critical Jamal Idris mistakes.

Inspirational Canterbury prop James Graham proved too strong, scoring a try and leading his fellow troops around the park.

The Bulldogs made their last grand final appearance in 2012 where their premiership campaign was cut cruelly short by Melbourne. 

They last tasted success a decade ago against the Sydney Roosters, and will be hoping to deliver coach Des Hasler his second win at the helm after he moved from Manly in 2012.
