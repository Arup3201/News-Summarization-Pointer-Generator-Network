Waitrose is to start selling a range of ‘blemished’ fruit in an attempt to curb the colossal levels of food dumped for being imperfect.

The supermarket will introduce a range of apples that have been damaged by poor weather conditions alongside its normal selection of more attractive fruit.

Britain’s top supermarkets have been criticised for wasting tonnes of misshapen fruit and vegetables that is considered too ugly to be sold.

Waitrose has decided to tackle the obsession with perfect produce, stocking specifically labelled Cripps Pink, Braeburn, Royal Gala and Cox varieties of apples.

Perfectly edible: Waitrose is to start selling a range of ¿blemished¿ fruit in an attempt to curb colossal levels of food waste

The supermarket also announced last week that it would sell packets of mixed tomatoes – one of the most wasted products – that are misshapen or have been bashed after falling from the vine.

The apples in the ‘weather-blemished’ line originate from Waitrose-backed farms in Africa where unseasonal weather has left up to 70 per cent of crops damaged.

Waitrose apple buyer Greg Sehringer said: ‘We are lucky that our customers are savvy enough who understand the unpredictability of farming and to trust that the fruit will be just as delicious, even if the apples don’t look as perfect as usual.’

An estimated  fifteen million tons of food valued at £19billion is thrown away across the UK in total every year

Strict EU rules on misshapen fruit and vegetables were relaxed in 2009 following years of criticism.

Marketing standards detailing acceptable sizes and shapes were scrapped altogether for 26 types of produce, including carrots, cauliflowers, cucumbers, leeks, plums and onions.

However they were kept in place for a number of popular items, including tomatoes, apples, grapes and pears - meaning that ‘substandard’ produce has to be specially labelled.

But a report by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers last year found that up to three quarters of vegetables grown in Britain ends up never being eaten.

It found that 30 per cent never make it to the supermarket shelf because they are considered too ugly to be sold.

While there are no exact figures on the amount of food discarded by supermarkets, a House of Lords inquiry this year heard that fifteen million tons of food valued at £19billion is thrown away across the UK in total every year.

Illustrating the amount of supermarket water, Tesco revealed that in the first six months of 2013 it generated 30,000 tonnes of food waste of which 21 per cent was fruit and vegetables.

Speaking about Waitrose’s decision to introduce the range, the NFU’s Guy Poskitt said: ‘Of course I welcome this news, but as farmers we’re always keen to get as much value back to the farm and reduce waste, so none of us intend to grow inferior produce.

‘And if supermarkets market these so-called ugly vegetables as a cheaper alternative, what will happen in good years when we have bumper crops of attractive produce?

‘The last thing we want to end up doing is putting our best produce in value ranges.’
