A Canadian woman who flew to Syria to join the fight against ISIS has reportedly been captured.

Gill Rosenberg, 31, left North America to join the ranks of the Kurdish Peshmerga fighting force, which has elite all-female units.

Rosenberg, a joint citizen of Israel who served in the Israeli Defense Force, went to fight against the so-called Islamic State earlier this month, while they were locked in combat over Kobane, a town on the Turkey-Syria border.

She had earlier posted on social media explaining her decision to go and fight, declaring she sympathized with the Kurds, whose territory has come under heavy assault.

Her position in the Israeli military is thought to have been a non-combat role.

But, according to the Times of London, militant sources have written online that Rosenberg was captured, along with several other female Peshmerga fighters.

She was reportedly taken hostage on Friday, when ISIS members hit Kobane with several suicide car bombs.

A spokesman for the Canadian foreign ministry said the government is 'aware of reports that a Canadian citizen was kidnapped in Syria.'

'Canada is pursuing all appropriate channels to seek further information and officials are in close contact with local authorities.'

According U.S.-based jihadist monitoring group SITE, militants were messaging one another online about whether it would be better to execute Rosenberg or attempt to trade her for prisoners held by the West.

However, some sources have cast doubt on the idea that she is in the area at all. 

IS jihadists began advancing on Kobane on September 16, hoping to quickly seize the small town and secure its grip on a large stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border, following advances it made in Iraq.

At one point, it looked set to overrun the town, but Kurdish Syrian fighters, backed by coalition air strikes and an influx of Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces, have held back the group.
