A young woman told her parents that she would kill herself if they did not help her kidnap an 11-month-old baby girl, a court was told.

Jodie Little, 23, was jailed for 16 months today after a court heard she abducted the child from a social services centre.

Following a two-day manhunt which cost around £76,000 pounds, police tracked Little to a flat she had rented under a false name. She was wearing a wig and holding the kidnapped baby in her arms.

Kidnapper: Jodie Little, 23, from Huddersfield was today jailed for taking a baby girl, aided by her parents

After failing to fool the police with her disguise on the morning of March 14 she picked up a knife and threatened to kill herself and the officers - forcing them out of the house in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, and into a two-hour negotiation.

A court heard Little’s parents Keith, 54, and Jayne, 47, drove the getaway rental car from the social services centre before spinning a web of lies to the police in an attempt to throw them off their daughter's trail.

Jodie Little, who has previous convictions for theft, had changed her name by deed poll to ‘Destiny Johnson’ two weeks before the kidnapping and enquired about passports and warm clothing, telling one vendor that she was 'going on a summer holiday with a child'.

Prosecuting at Bradford Crown Court, Simon Waley said Jodie Little arrived at the social services centre in Huddersfield on the morning of March 12.

After kidnapping the baby, she jumped into a Vauxhall Meriva driven by her parents before going on the run with the baby for two days.

Mr Waley said: 'The police managed to track her down to the address. It was later revealed that she had paid three months rent in advance and signed the tenancy agreement as Sarah Johnson.

'Jodie answered the door holding the child. She was wearing a blonde wig. She gave her name as Sarah Johnson.

'The officer - knowing that it was Jodie - attempted to calmly talk to her and take hold of the child.

'At that point Jodie grabbed a knife and accepts that she was waving it around in her own vicinity and towards the officers.

'She made threats and screamed ‘get out or I will kill you'.

'The
officers left the property and Jodie could clearly be seen through the 
window holding the knife in one hand while cradling the baby in her 
arms.'

Prior to this, despite the fact that they had dropped her off at the house, her parents phoned the police to say that Jodie Little had left them a letter saying that she was going to kill herself and the child.

Mr Waley added: 'Jayne said she had no idea where her daughter was and said that if she did she would tell the police.

'After being arrested Jayne told the police that Jodie had friends in London who she could possibly be staying with. Keith made no comment at interview.'

Mitigating for Jodie Little, Jayne Beckett said the young woman had suffered a troubled life and had various personality disorder type traits as a result of it.

She added: 'Jodie is adamant that her parents were brought into this matter by her. She told them that she would kill herself if they did not help her and they obviously took that threat very seriously given that Jodie’s older sister committed suicide in 2008.'

The Law Courts in Bradford, where Little and her parents were today sentenced.

Sentencing Jodie Little to 16 months imprisonment for kidnap and affray, Judge John Potter said: 'You put this child in real and immediate danger.

'Children have a right to be protected from harm and those that act in a way that could cause harm to children must expect an immediate custodial sentence.'

Both Keith and Jayne Little were sentenced to nine months imprisonment suspended for two years for kidnap.

Keith, who now lives in London and had travelled back to West Yorkshire for the kidnapping, was ordered to complete 250 hours of unpaid work and Jayne was given supervision from the probation service.

After the case, Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley of West Yorkshire Police’s Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, said: 'This was a very sensitive enquiry in which the overriding focus of our investigation was to ensure the welfare and safe recovery of the victim.'

'Safeguarding vulnerable members of our communities is a priority and we are pleased that that this investigation has now been brought to a successful conclusion.'
