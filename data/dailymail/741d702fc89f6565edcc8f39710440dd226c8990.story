Asses' milk became the ultimate symbol of luxury when Cleopatra bathed in it to keep her skin soft.

And now the famously frugal Pope Francis has revealed that he too is an aficionado of donkey milk.

Francis was presented with the two donkeys, named Thea and Noah, as an unusual early Christmas present, by a company that produces donkey milk for babies that are allergic to other milks.

After thanking Pierluigi Christophe Orunesu, of donkey farming cooperative Eurolactis Italia, for the curious gift, a delighted Francis revealed that he too as a baby was fed donkey milk.

Mr Orunesu said the pope was ‘very happy'. ‘I told him he will have two friends for life,’ he told Dairy Reporter website.

‘Pope Francis told me that his mother regularly gave him donkey’s milk where she could not provide enough breast milk or later on when he was a child,’ he said.

The company also donated 21 gallons of donkey’s milk to the pediatric hospital in Rome.

Scientists are becoming increasingly interested in asses’ milk for its similarities to human mothers' milk.

Its proteins are easier to digest than cows’ milk and it contains less harmful fats present in other milks, the farmers claim. It can be given increasing number of children who are allergic to the proteins in traditional milks.

Happy life: The donkeys will now go to live at the pope’s farm at the papal summer palace of Castel Gandolfo 30 miles outside Rome

The donkeys will now go to live at the pope’s farm at the papal summer palace of Castel Gandolfo 30 miles outside Rome.

The company said in a statement 'This gift of two very friendly young donkeys, Thea and Noah, is less surprising than it might first seem; the Holy Father chose to take the forename of Saint Francis of Assisi, who considered animals to be God’s living creations and elevated them to the status of brothers to mankind.

'The donkey also holds a prominent place in the bible. This was the animal that kept Jesus warm in his manger in Bethlehem.'

Two years ago Pope Benedict claimed that donkeys were not part of the Nativity.

Who, me? Two years ago Pope Benedict claimed that donkeys were not part of the Nativity

He wrote in his book about the childhood of Jesus that the presence of animals like cattle and donkeys in traditional Nativity scenes is based on little more than a myth and was probably inspired by pre-Christian traditions.

‘There is no mention of animals in the Gospels,’ he wrote.

Francis has said that animals do, after all, go to heaven.

In his weekly audience in St Peter's, last week Francis quoted the apostle Paul who comforted a child who was crying after his dog died.

‘One day we will see our animals again in eternity of Christ’, Francis quoted Paul as saying. The Pope added: ‘Paradise is open to all God’s creatures.’

His position is markedly different from that of Pope Benedict XVI said that the other animals ‘are not called to the eternal life’.
