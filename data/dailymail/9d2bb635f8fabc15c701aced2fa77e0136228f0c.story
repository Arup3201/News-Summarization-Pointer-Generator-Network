She was the last line of defence but these dramatic pictures prove how a little old lady was no match for armed robbers as they staged a daring gems raid.

The elderly woman in her 80s shuffled towards the gang and waved her walking stick at one of them after she spotted them looting a jewellery store of Rolex watches.

But as the brave OAP attempted to thwart the robbery the burly masked hoodlum - turned to her as she stood in the entrance of the shop then stood over her waving a samurai sword in her face.

As she retreated a few paces the robber then towered over the woman telling her to 'butt out' before the gang fled the store clutching a booty worth at least £200,000.

The old woman could only look on helplessly as the gang barged past her during their escape.

Pictures of the dramatic raid at Fraser Hart Jewellers in Rochdale, Greater Manchester emerged as five men began jail terms totalling over 32 years over 20 raids in which jewellery worth £1.8m was stolen.

One officer said: 'She was [an] extremely brave old lady to confront those men but we would never recommend anyone to do what she did.

'She obviously suspected these people were up to no good but thankfully she did retreat when one of the robbers told her mind her own business. We’re thankful she wasn’t injured at all although it must have been very shocking for her.'The robbery occurred at 10.30am on July 7 2010 when the three masked men forced the security door of the shop on Yorkshire Street then used a crow bar to break the display glass at the front of the store and stole a number of watches.

The unnamed pensioner was believed to be on a shopping trip when she noticed the robbery taking place.

She tried to intervene and one of the offenders waved the sword in her face and hit the weapon against the window of the shop in attempt to frighten her away. The gang escaped in an Audi getaway car stolen from a house.

Police captured the gang after linking them to a number of raids in which they used stolen cars to target high street jewellers.

The gang would often arm themselves with weapons such as crowbars and swords to attack the jewellers during busy trading hours while members of the public were shopping, using balaclavas to disguise themselves.

In August 2010 they struck at the Humberstones Jewellers in Blackburn, Lancs using weapons to force open the door and smashing the display units with crowbars.

They then put up to £80,000 worth of jewellery into black bags before fleeing in a stolen car. The following day, four expensive motorcycles worth up to £13,500 were stolen during a burglary at the Manchester Motorcycle Centre on Manchester Road, Altrincham.

Then in September 2010, the same gang
were involved in an armed robbery at Peter Jackson the Jeweller on St 
John Square, The Rock, Bury.

The
masked men drove a stolen red Subaru through a pedestrians-only area 
before threatening staff with a large machete and stealing more than 
£100,000 worth of watches.

In another raid the gang burst into David Robinsons the Jewellers in Altrincham, during which a stolen Volvo was used to ram raid the shop before staff were threatened with crowbars and sledgehammers. A large amount of valuable watches were stolen.

The gang were arrested in September 2010 after they raided a hair and beauty salon in Stockport not realising it was under police surveillance.

At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Dale Fitzpatrick, 28, of Seymour Avenue, Clayton, Manchester was jailed for ten years after he admitted conspiracy to rob and burgle and asked for 49 burglary offences to be consideration.

Paul Smith, 26, of Devon Close, Brinnington, Stockport, was jailed for nine years and four months after admitting conspiracy and asking for 38 offences to be considered.

Philip Clarke, 25, of Lymm Close, Bridgehall, Stockport was jailed for four years. Lewis Murkin, 26, of Daresbury Close, Bridgehall, Stockport was jailed for four years and eight months.

Michael Stephen Bradbury, 26, of Church View, Lymm, Cheshire was jailed for three years and eight months.

All pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit robbery and conspiracy to commit burglary.

Det Insp Chris Duffy, from the Force Robbery Unit, said today: 'These men were involved in a plot stretching at least four months to steal cars which would then be used to target high street jewellers.

'The mere fact the conspiracy involves more than 20 criminal acts shows just how determined and persistent these criminals were, and had it not been for my officers who locked them up and put them away for a long time, these men would undoubtedly be out there today committing more robberies.

'Make no mistake - the streets are far safer now these men are behind bars.

'I hope this case sends out a message to the criminal fraternity that no matter how long it takes, we will use all the resources at our disposal to disrupt your activities and send you to prison.'
