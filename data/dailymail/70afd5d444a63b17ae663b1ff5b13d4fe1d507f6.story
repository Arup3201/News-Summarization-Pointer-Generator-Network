Pleaded: Colton Harris-Moore, aka the Barefoot Bandit, pleaded guilty to a string of sensational thefts

The young Washington state man who gained international notoriety during a two-year run from the law in stolen boats, cars and planes has pleaded guilty to seven charges in the 'Barefoot Bandit' case.

Colton Harris-Moore, 20, entered the plea in federal court Friday morning, reversing a not guilty plea made last week and ending the latest chapter in his fugitive saga.

He could receive between 5 1/4 and 6 1/2 years in prison when he's sentenced in October, said Harris-Moore's attorney, John Henry Browne.

Federal prosecutors were to give details of the plea deal reached with the 20-year-old's lawyers after the Friday morning hearing.

The two sides had been negotiating whether Harris-Moore could participate in book or movie deals, with proceeds used to repay victims. His lawyers have said restitution could total about $1.3 million.

Prosecutors have said Harris-Moore hopscotched his way across the United States, frequently crash-landing planes in rural areas and stealing cars from parking lots at small airports.

In Indiana, he stole another plane and made for the Bahamas, where he was captured last July.

Harris-Moore earned the 'Barefoot Bandit' moniker by committing some of the alleged crimes without shoes.

His escapades earned him cult status as an authority-mocking folk hero, and federal prosecutors have expressed reluctance to let him sell his story because it could compound the publicity he's received.

Colton Harris-Moore could have gotten decades in jail, but his plea deal is likely to net him just a few years behind bars

Harris-Moore is also expected to face state charges later on in the county where his crimes began.

The
federal charges, though, stem from a spate of crimes in late 2009 and 
early 2010, when Harris-Moore is accused of flying a stolen plane from 
Anacortes, in northwestern Washington, to the San Juan Islands.

Authorities say he then stole a pistol in eastern British Columbia and 
took a plane from a hangar in Idaho, where investigators found bare 
footprints on the floor and wall. That plane crashed near Granite Falls,
Wash., after it ran out of fuel, prosecutors said.

He made his 
way to Oregon in a 32-foot boat stolen in southwestern Washington - 
stopping first to leave $100 at an animal shelter in Raymond, Wash. From
Oregon, authorities said, Harris-Moore travelled across the United 
States until he made it to the Bahamas

In all, Harris-Moore is suspected of more than 100 crimes across nine states.

Harris-Moore's lawyer, John Henry Browne, said his client has already agreed that he does not want to benefit from his past behaviour.

'Everything is already agreed to. Colton does not and did not want a 
dime and thinks it's wrong to benefit from this,' Browne told the Seattle Times.
