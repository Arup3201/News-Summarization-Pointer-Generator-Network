The British National Party has laughed off its leader Nick Griffin being declared bankrupt, joking its better than being a millionaire in a coma like Michael Shumacher.

The tasteless remark about the Formula 1 star came as fans held a silent vigil outside the hospital where he is being treated for a head injury suffered in a skiing accident on Sunday.

But Mr Griffin brushed aside the idea that his financial problems would end his 
political career and revealed he is writing a booklet on dealing with 
debts.

BNP leader Nick Griffin has been declared bankrupt but insists he will stand for election to the European Parliament again in May

The outspoken politician insisted he will continue as a member of the European Parliament and run for re-election in May.

As Mr Griffin's financial problems were 
made public, BNP press officer Simon Darby told Huffington Post: 'Look at it this way. Michael Schumacher has millions in the bank, but he'd do 
anything to be in Nick's position now wouldn't he.'

Schumacher is in a critical but stable condition after suffering brain injuries in a skiing accident on Sunday.

In a message coinciding with his 45th birthday, his family said they were touched by the support shown by fans.

As an MEP Mr Griffin enjoys a basic salary of around £76,000, plus extra basic allowances worth £46,000 with more for travel and accommodation.

A listing at the Insolvency Service showed Mr Griffin was declared bankrupt at Welshpool and Newtown County Court yesterday.

The BNP said that Mr Griffin had run up debts of £120,000 to solicitors Gilbert Davies & Partners, which represented him in the early stages of legal action against the European Commission.

He had offered to repay 42p for every pound he owed to all his creditors but this was rejected by the courts.

The tasteless joke by BNP press officer Simon Darby came as fans of former Formula 1 champion Michael Schumacher held a vigil outside the hospital where he is being treated following a serious skiing accident on Sunday

Politicians declared bankrupt used to be barred from seeking election again, but the rules were changed in 2002 meaning it no longer prevents someone from being an MP or MEP, or standing for election.

In a statement Mr Griffin said: 'This order will not prevent me fighting for the interests of the British people or leading the British National Party to a fresh round of electoral victories.

'It’s of no political significance whatsoever.  I will take whatever is thrown at me and deal with it.

'I champion the right of the British people to their land and I will never surrender.

'On a practical note, I am now much better able to advise and help the huge numbers of decent ordinary folk in my constituency who have financial difficulties of their own.

'I will be producing an advice booklet on dealing with debt very shortly and can speak from personal experience rather than from an ivory tower in Brussels.'

Mr Griffin will be automatically discharged from bankruptcy in one year, on January 2 2015, in accordance with the Insolvency Act. He was elected for the North West region of England in 2009.

Advice published by the Electoral Commission said bankruptcy in itself does not bar someone from being a member of the European Parliament or standing for election.

Restrictions are only triggered if an individual is made subject to a bankruptcy restrictions order or debt relief restrictions order.

The Insolvency Service said such orders had not been made in Mr Griffin's case.
