There was something very frightening happening at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Something terrifyingly real, something tremendously ominous.

That’s the case if you happen to be in the homes of Mr Pellegrini, Wenger or Rodgers. Looking back on a comeback win against an impressive Swansea City, the residence of Jose Mourinho will be a very serene place indeed.

Why? Because two of his summer gems – Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas – are showing more than a fleeting glimpse that they could become the next great Premier League double act.

The pairing of Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa have formed a deadly partnership for Chelsea

It was they who dragged Chelsea from their considerable slumber, turning a game on its head and ruthlessly sending the Welsh side packing.

These two signings could prove the difference between Chelsea going close – see May for details – and clinching a title. 

Four years ago, the last time they lifted the crown, there was Frank Lampard supplying Didier Drogba. This duo is different, but threatening something just as devilish.

Jose Mourinho congratulates his new star striker Diego Costa after he scored a hat-trick on Saturday

1. Cesc Fabregas                6

2. Gylfi Sigurdsson             4

3. Ramires                           3

First, the numbers.

- Costa is the only player in Premier League history to notch seven goals in his first four games, beating Sergio Aguero and Micky Quinn (both six).

- The striker has two more already than a certain Fernando Torres managed in the entirety of last year.

- Fabregas is the first player in the top-flight to have ever bagged an assist in six consecutive games (including his last two matches for Arsenal).

- Costa’s goals have come from 10 shots on target and he is the first player to find the net in his first four games for Chelsea since John Meredith in 1928.

It is easy to be blinded by figures, dazzled by the breaking of records. In this case, though, those are merely a pleasing by-product to a blossoming relationship that will only mature with age.

Cesc Fabregas' brilliant start to life at Chelsea will also have pleased his manager Jose Mourinho

Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa have played together for Spain but their partnership is still relatively new

The signs at the Bridge were that Fabregas and Costa mean serious business, and Mourinho knows it. The manager dealt with questions about the performances of both with the type of nonchalance a man who expects this type of dynamism on a regular basis serves up.

Chelsea have been accused of extreme mechanism under the Portuguese but that is now redundant. The Blues managed to weed out the deadwood and have taken on more exuberance.

The golden pair are at the heart of this new-look Mourinho outfit. When Costa comes short, Fabregas threads a ball into feet; when he spins a defender, the playmaker looks to go over the top. The understanding on Saturday was akin to team-mates who had been together for seasons. 

While they have played together for Spain, the sharpness with which they have engineered lightning intuition remains remarkable.

David Beckham and Ruud van Nistelrooy formed a deadly partnership together in their years at Old Trafford

Steven Gerrard provided plenty of assists for Fernando Torres when they played together at Liverpool

David Beckham showed something similar in his final seasons at Old Trafford by providing for the clinical Ruud van Nistelrooy. 

Robert Pires and Thierry Henry fired Arsenal to two titles in three years, including the famous invincible season, while Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres formed a deadly duo at Liverpool. 

More recently, David Silva and Sergio Aguero have helped Manchester City to their first two Premier League titles. None of those partnerships showed such early promise as Chelsea’s, though.

Fabregas assisted two of Costa’s hat-trick against the Swans – adding to when they combined against Everton – and there is a real belief in SW3 that the boss has hit the right note.

He spoke of waiting for the ‘right’ striker to come along – reaffirming that Chelsea bided their time in bidding for Costa, instead of jumping head first into a condensed and inflated market last year. They had to watch nervously as Manchester United flirted with Fabregas in 2013 too.

Good – or proficient – things seemingly come to those who wait. ‘Those two together are as good a partnership as I’ve seen in a long time,’ was the assessment of Danny Murphy on the BBC. Even at this early stage it’s difficult to disagree.

David Silva and Sergio Aguero are the latest partnership for Fabregas and Costa to try and emulate

Mourinho must take more than a portion of the plaudits after this display. He saw that Fabregas was itching to impact the game higher up the pitch – and was actually caught out of position during a timid first half.

The Spaniard shone in a more advanced role and it could be that he takes up that station from the start too often – impeccable service into Costa dictates that.
