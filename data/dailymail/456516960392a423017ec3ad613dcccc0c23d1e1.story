Tax collectors have spent nearly £100million over the past year on training courses – many of which were a waste of time, a damning report reveals today.

The study, from the official spending watchdog, is fiercely critical of HM Revenue and Customs for having ‘no strategy’ about how to train staff.

The National Audit Office said HMRC did not even know how much it had spent on such courses in the tax year 2010/11.

To make matters worse, the report said just 38 per cent of workers found the training ‘had improved their performance’.

HMRC employs 68,000 staff, many of whom appear to spend a large amount of their time being trained.

Between April 2010 and April 2011, the NAO discovered they had taken part in an astonishing 730,000 courses. An average of  £1,419 was spent on each employee last year, at a total cost of £96.5million.

The report comes just a few weeks after an internal survey of the same staff revealed that many are desperate to leave their jobs. Just one in five said they felt proud to work for HMRC.

The NAO report found there were more than 2,000 courses for tax staff, which it said seemed a lot, even for a large and complex organisation.

Ninety sessions had just one participant, and others were described as obsolete. One course, which cost nearly £10million, was aimed at teaching 15,045 workers about a new penalties regime.

The NAO said however it did not achieve ‘the expected increase in penalties collected’. The training had to be supplemented at a further cost of £1.9million.

Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: ‘At the level of the business as a whole, HMRC has no strategy to manage the £96million it spends each year on skills.’

John O’Connell of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Of course, it is important that staff are up to scratch, but HMRC proves time and again that it is incapable of getting the taxes of millions of ordinary taxpayers right.

The fact they feel obliged to spend this much on training proves the tax system is far too complicated, meaning families and businesses find it unpredictable, punitive and burdensome.’

Around six million people are being sent letters telling them that they have overpaid tax, and can expect to get back £2.5billion, the equivalent of £400 each.

A further 1.2million, including more than 150,000 pensioners, face the shock of being told they did not pay enough. On average, they will have to find £600 each.

Meanwhile, Dave Hartnett, HMRC’s permanent secretary on tax, has faced calls to resign after admitting ‘making a mistake’ in allowing the investment bank Goldman Sachs to be let off paying its full tax bill.

An HMRC spokesman said: ‘Making sure our staff have the right skills is vital. We will take on the NAO’s recommendations to ensure skills development happens where it is most needed.’

HMRC has cut its staff numbers by 29 per cent since 2005 when the Inland Revenue was merged with HM Customs and Excise.

Over the next four years, it plans to cut a further 10,000 posts.

Civil servants are using taxpayer-funded credit cards to pay for body-building supplements, snooker equipment and wood-burning stoves. Thousands of pounds has been spent on Ministry of Justice procurement cards over the past two months. 

A payment of £570 went to diywetroom.com, a supplier of materials for designer shower rooms, and £849.75 to onlineturf.com, which sells astroturf football pitches. 

In September, £2,378 was spent on sports equipment at retailer Barrington and another £813.88 at snooker table maker Thurstons.

The department recorded spending of £658.80 with the Encyclopaedia Britannica and £1,000 with Gloucestershire Stove Centre, which sells wood-burning stoves.

Details of all procurement card expenditure over £500 are published every month by government departments to improve ‘transparency’. 

Officials said many purchases were made by prison staff on behalf of inmates, who would repay them.

'Transparency needed': Matthew Elliott from the Taxpayers Alliance

Matthew Elliott of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Civil servants have legitimate expenses and procurement cards are actually an effective and efficient way to manage them, but it’s clear that a culture of excess is rife in Whitehall and at town halls.

'It’s good news that the MoJ has decided to publish its spending, as credit card abuse has got out of hand.

‘But publishing this spending should be very easy to do as it is simply a case of putting credit card statements online, so while it’s good to see movements in the right direction, there’s no reason for a £500 limit.

‘We need more transparency and accountability across the public sector as this will help to expose civil servants running up huge expenses and leaving them for taxpayers to pay.’ 

In August, the cards were used to spend £939.44 with beauty products supplier Avon, and £527.73 with Monster Supplement, which sells bodybuilding supplies.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘The government procurement card is only used for essential departmental business, and is a convenient and cost-effective way to purchase products and services. Each card has a limit on any individual purchase.

‘Between 2009/10 and 2010/11 spending on a procurement card fell by 13 per cent. 

‘We have a zero tolerance policy on abuse of the system and disciplinary action will be taken against staff where there is evidence of wrongdoing.’

Plan: Ged Curran from Merton Council in Surrey had time off 'to think'

A council faced with laying off a third of its 4,000 staff told its chief executive to spend one day in ten out of the office – as time to think.

Ged Curran was supposed to be off-site at least fortnightly to ‘review the strategic direction’ of Merton Council, in Surrey. The move, agreed by leading councillors, was abandoned after three months.

The out-of-office day was among a number of management targets set out in a leaked document.

Mr Curran, who was paid £215,546 last year, is supposed to manage the organisation as it reduces in size by a third and ‘maintain personal perspective and self-knowledge’.

Council leader Stephen Alambritis (Labour) said the idea had been for the chief executive to see what other boroughs were doing without the pressure of deadlines and meetings. This plan was axed because of the tough times, he said.

A Merton Council spokesman said Mr Curran had worked five days out of the office between April and September.

She added that he had studied topics including localism, shared services and caring for the elderly.

A health watchdog spent £9million on redundancy packages for penpushers, many of whom could have been retrained as inspectors of hospitals and old people’s homes, a report reveals.

Last year the Care Quality Commission paid off 140 managers and other bureaucrats, who received an average of £66,000 each, according to the National Audit Office.

But at the time the CQC was also trying to recruit more than 100 inspectors to check hospitals and care homes.

Some managers being made redundant were offered the chance to retrain – but many chose to take the generous payoff instead.

The National Audit Office also found that last year the CQC inspected just 7,368 hospitals and care homes – less than half the number checked in the previous year.

It said the watchdog had devoted its attention to ensuring tens of thousands of care homes and agencies were registered.

MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the public accounts committee, said: ‘The findings are deeply worrying and highlight significant failures that put patient care at risk.’

She added there was too much box ticking and too little checking on quality.
