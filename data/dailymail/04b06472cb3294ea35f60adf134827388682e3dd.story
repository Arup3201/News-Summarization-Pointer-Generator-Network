Families may have been overcharged £150 for their electricity bills, but it is hard to tell because the market is so complex, according to a senior figure at the energy regulator.

Ian Marlee, a senior partner at Ofgem, was asked to respond to new figures from Labour suggesting the major energy suppliers had charged customers an average of £150 too much over the past three years.

But he suggested it was not possible to establish whether this was the case, saying: ‘What was identified in our work is that there is actually not enough transparency to be able to actually look at that.’

He said the regulator was ‘looking into it’ and was in the process of enacting major reforms which would make the market simpler for consumers to understand.

Mr Marlee conceded there ‘wasn’t enough trading going on’ in the energy market but said the reforms would introduce more competition by helping independent suppliers break into the marketplace.

Labour have accused the so-called Big Six energy giants, who supply electricity to 98 per cent of the country, of buying power from their own stations and then charging their customers over the market rate.

Shadow energy spokesman Caroline Flint said their analysis of official figures suggested the firms were ripping off customers to the tune of nearly £4billion to boost profits.

The research compared the prices at which these firms bought their electricity with those of the small supplier First Utility, and found it was higher.

If the firms did sell to each other at an inflated price, they could stand accused of misleading Parliament because power company bosses who gave evidence to MPs last year claimed they only ‘self-supply’ a small amount of electricity or none at all.

Miss Flint said: ‘These figures reveal the full extent of the way consumers have been overcharged for their electricity. Energy companies always blame wholesale costs when they put up bills, but it now looks like they’ve deliberately inflated prices to boost profits from their power stations.

‘The regulator Ofgem has serious questions to answer about why it has failed to monitor the way in which companies have bought electricity from themselves and why it has allowed these companies to overcharge their customers.’

Shadow energy minister Tom Greatrex added: ‘It is just not good enough for Ofgem to say it doesn’t know whether consumers are being overcharged – it’s the regulator’s job to know.’

A few hours after Mr Marlee’s comment on Radio 4’s Today programme, Ofgem released a statement saying they did not believe the Big Six firms were overcharging customers as Labour claimed.

An Ofgem spokesman said they had not seen details of Labour’s analysis, and ‘would clearly consider more detailed information’ from them in their next report.

But he said: ‘Ofgem regularly looks at the relationship between wholesale and retail prices and our own analysis of the evidence does not support this allegation. Where we have found evidence that firms have not played by the rules we have acted. Since 2010 we have imposed over £75million of penalties and redress payments on the industry.’

All of the Big Six firms raised gas and electricity prices for customers by up to 10 per cent at the end of last year.

Energy UK, representing the Big Six, said suppliers pay ‘the most competitive price they can for the gas and electricity they purchase’ and claimed Labour’s figures ‘don’t give the true picture’.
