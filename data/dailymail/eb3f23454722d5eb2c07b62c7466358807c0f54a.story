Manchester United came from behind to beat Chelsea 2-1 in their Barclays Under 21 Premier League encounter at Leigh Sports Village stadium on Monday evening.

Dominic Solanke gave the visitors the lead from close range after 55 minutes, before Andreas Pereira's deflected free-kick got the hosts back on level terms.

And defender Tom Thorpe completed the turnaround United, heading home emphatically from close range with just six minutes left on the clock.

The Blues fielded a starting XI of complete juniors whereas United had six players who had represented the first team under Louis van Gaal. 

The experienced line-up included the likes of former Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes, Ashley Young, Rafael and Tyler Blackett.

Chelsea began the evening top of the table and started like leaders. 

Blackett failed to deal with an early delivery from the Blues and the ball fell to Andreas Christensen, but he shot wide from eight yards at a tight angle.

The half descended into a scrappy affair with Young the main receiver of some tough challenges from the away side, as neither team managed to conjure up any promising chances.

The contest sprung into life after the break. Young was guilty of a misplaced back pass which left Blackett under unnecessary pressure and the lively Izzy Brown stole the ball to seek out Dominic Solanke at the back post to tap in from a few yards  on 55 minutes.

Soon after Young was replaced having played an hour of football on his return to action, having missed five games with a hamstring injury. 

Chelsea fully deserved their lead and Brown once again impressed. After the hour mark the England Under 19 international jinked past three challenges before whipping in a fierce drive from the edge of the United box.

Fortunately for the home side Valdes was ready to react and tip the shot around the post with a smart save.

The pivotal moment in the match came when Rafael went on another marauding run forward, to be eventually hauled down on the edge of the Chelsea penalty area.

Andreas Pereira took the honour and his effort deflected cruelly off Jay Dasilva in the Chelsea wall and wrong footed Mitchell Beeney to level the match.

That was the catalyst for United as minutes later Pereira flashed in another long range free-kick, only for Beeney to pull off a fine reaction save.

Finally, United were in the ascendancy and made the pressure count in a tense final ten minutes.

Pereira was once again involved, whipping in a teasing cross when United captain Tom Thorpe rose unmarked to head the hosts into the lead.

Despite the best efforts of Chelsea to find an equaliser, United held on to go joint top of the table alongside Chelsea and Southampton, who lost to Everton.
