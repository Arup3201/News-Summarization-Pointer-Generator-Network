She may have been one of Mexico's top union bosses, but she was living in the lap of American luxury before her arrest for embezzlement on Tuesday.

Elba Esther Gordillo, known as Mexico's teacher, traded her designer handbags for a prison jumpsuit after she was whisked away by cops in Mexico City as she got off her private plane.

That plane was one of many amenities that Gordillo enjoyed in the years since becoming the National Education Workers Union leader - and Mexico's most powerful women - in 1989.

She was known for her 
designer clothes and accessories, including Hermés and Chanel, luxury cars and plastic surgery.

For Gordillo, her arrest was a dizzying fall from power for a woman who traveled on 
private jets and maintained properties worth millions of dollars in 
Southern California.

A company that Mexican prosecutors said was registered to her dead mother's estate owns two multimillion-dollar homes in Coronado, a wealthy peninsular enclave across the bay from downtown San Diego.

The homes are across the street from each other in a gated community that caters to  people with second homes.

A modern six-bedroom home with a three-car was purchased in 1991 for $1.15 million and is currently assessed at $4.72million.

A boat was docked behind the house on Wednesday.

The company, Comercializadora TTS SA 
de CV, owns another property across the street that was purchased in 
2010 and is currently assessed at $4.08million.

Only a wood frame currently sits on the property.

Lothar Kramer, 85, has lived next 
door to the six-bedroom home since 1985 and said he rarely saw anyone at
the home and didn't know who lived there.

The island has been home to numerous celebrities and politicians, including Newt Gingrich, Donny Osmond, Popcorn magnate Orville Redenbacher, Stone Temple Pilots Singer Scott Weiland and Wallis Simpson, the Duchess of Windsor.

In addition, prosecutors said they had detected 
nearly $3million in purchases at Neiman Marcus stores using union funds,
as well as $17,000 in U.S. plastic surgery bills and the purchase of a 
million-dollar home in San Diego.

Gordillo was charged with embezzling 2 
billion pesos (about $160 million) from union funds and was arrested on 
Tuesday as she returned from San Diego for a meeting of leaders of the 
1.5 million-member National Union of Education Workers she has led for 
nearly a quarter-century.

Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said the
investigation started in December, just after Pena Nieto took office, 
when Banco Santander alerted authorities to transfers of billions of 
pesos, according to the attorney general.

Some funds eventually ended up in 
bank accounts in Switzerland and Liechtenstein, according to Assistant 
Attorney General Alfredo Castillo, who said that in one case, $1million 
went to a Swiss account for a company owned by Gordillo's mother.

Those funds were then used to buy a 
million-dollar house on the Coronado peninsula near San Diego, where 
Gordillo spends much of her time.

Rivals have long accused her of corruption, 
misuse of union funds and even a murder, but prosecutors who 
investigated never brought a charge against her.

Her career began humbly as a teenage schoolteacher in the impoverished Chiapas state before she rose to power and became a maker of presidents.

She was heading the union's fight with 
President Enrique Pena Nieto's administration over the country's most 
sweeping educational reform in more than 70 years.

Mexico's new government has denied that politics was the motivation behind her arrest.

In a news conference minutes after 
Gordillo's detention, he said the investigation started in December, 
just after Pena Nieto took office, when Banco Santander alerted 
authorities to transfers of billions of pesos, according to the attorney
general.

Some funds eventually ended up in bank 
accounts in Switzerland and Liechtenstein, according to Assistant 
Attorney General Alfredo Castillo, who said that in one case, $1million
went to a Swiss account for a company owned by Gordillo's mother.

Those
funds were then used to buy a million-dollar house on the Coronado 
peninsula near San Diego.

In a television interview last week about education reform, the interviewer told Gordillo that she was the most hated woman in Mexico.

She replied: 'There is no one more loved by their people than I. I care about the teachers. This is a deep and serious dispute about public education.'
