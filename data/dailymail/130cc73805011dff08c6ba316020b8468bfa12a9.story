A father-of-two with 'a heart of gold' was killed in a motorway crash as he drove to deliver Valentine's gifts to his girlfriend. 

Mark Jones, 44, died when his black BMW flipped onto its roof after veering into the central reservation of the M65 near Burnley.

The crash took place while he was travelling to see his partner Alison Sutcliffe, 40, at her home in Hapton, Lancashire, on Friday evening.

The road was closed for four hours while a team of 15 firefighters worked to free Mr Jones from the wreckage. But Mr Jones died at the scene.

His family have described Mr Jones, from Barrowford, Lancashire, as a 'great guy', with a 'heart of gold'. 

His mother Jackie Rogers, 64, said: 'He was the loveliest person you were ever going to meet and he idolised his children.

'He thought the world of his kids and his time with Alison was the happiest of his life.

'The last thing he said to me was "I love you mum", which is fitting really.' 

The engineer, who had children Daniel, 18, and Rebecca, 17 with his first wife Melanie, had split from Alison in August last year. They had got back together but were still living separately.  

His brother Christian Wakeford, 30, said: 'The whole family is in a state of shock and disbelief.

'Being woken up by the police on Friday night was the worst experience of my life.

Devastated: His mother Jackie Rogers and half-brother Christian Wakeford said the whole family is in 'shock' 

'Mark was a great brother and we were very close. It's tragic that he has been taken from us so early.

'I would like to thank everyone who has been leaving tributes for him online and who have contacted us.

'It's nice to know that there are people out there who are thinking of us at this horrible time.'

He added: 'Mark was one of those people who knew exactly how to wind you up but he was a great guy.

'He always had a smile on his face and he had a heart of gold. 

'He was so thoughtful, spontaneous and caring and I can't believe what has happened.' 

Mr Jones's car flipped one mile past junction 10 of the M65, before coming to rest 200 metres down the westbound carriageway.

It happened on a section of the carriageway run by the Highways Agency which unlit. The family stressed they did not believe the lack of lights had anything to do with Mr Jones's death.

Shortly before the accident, a report was made to police about Mr Jones's car being driven 'erratically'. 

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting log number 1224 of February 13 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
