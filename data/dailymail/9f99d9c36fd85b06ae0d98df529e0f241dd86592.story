A 27-year-old man has died in outback NSW while attempting to recreate scenes from the iconic Mad Max film franchise with a group of fellow fans.

The man, believed to be a US national, died instantly on Tuesday evening when his motorbike collided with a Mack truck causing him to be thrown from the vehicle.

Police from the Barrier Local Area Command said that he was one of a number of Mad Max enthusiasts visiting Silverton, just outside of Broken Hill, where the Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, starring Mel Gibson, was filmed in 1981.

The man, who is believed to have been involved in the collective, and may have travelled from the US to participate, was travelling along Silverton Road toward the Mundi Mundi lookout, both of which feature heavily in the film, when the incident occurred. 

Owner of the Silverton Hotel, Peter Price, said that the Mad Max community was devastated by the news.

'There has been an outpouring of grief from everybody that's been involved and we've had numerous phone calls this morning from avid fans that have been this way and it's been ... not nice,' Mr Price told The ABC. 

'For the Mad Max family, it is a group of people worldwide and they'll be devastated by this, but I think the support that's there is so strong in the culture and I think there'll be plenty of support for everybody,' he said. 

 The movie, starring Mel Gibson, was filmed in 1981, and is considered to be an iconic post-apocalyptic piece

'[Mad Max] has been part of the Silverton psyche you might say for over 33 years now since the film was made. [The organisers] are very passionate about what they do and [the event] brings a big range of diverse people from all over Australia and all over the world to witness a place where this iconic field has taken place.'

The biennial gathering has been running for several years, and is organised largely by Silverton couple Lindy and Adrian Bennett.

Mr Price said that his thoughts went out to the couple, who own and operate the Mad Max 2 Museum.

On the museum's Facebook page a post written on Tuesday evening indicated that the business was closed until further notice.
