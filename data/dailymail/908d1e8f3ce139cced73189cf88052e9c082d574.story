A child sex killer has been released back on to the streets despite remaining a serious danger to children.

Robert Oliver, 59, was a key member of a notorious gang of paedophiles known as the 'dirty dozen' that has been linked to the deaths of nine boys.

But he has been happily mingling with families and children near his bail hostel in Guildford after serving less than 12 months of a three-year sentence for grooming young boys.

Oliver was jailed last July for breaching supposedly strict conditions designed  to keep vulnerable youngsters out of  his clutches.

They had been imposed after he served time for his part in the killing of 14-year-old Jason Swift.

Families had unwittingly befriended the paedophile and let their children visit his bungalow in Maidstone, Kent. He gave one boy a birthday card and allowed another to use his toilet.

But one of their fathers became suspicious and called in police after discovering Oliver's history on the internet.

Oliver admitted breaching a Sexual Offences Prevention Order and was jailed for three years.

Now, after less than a year, he has already been granted his freedom and his appearance on the streets of the Surrey town has sparked uproar among worried families. His bail hostel is just 500 yards from a primary school.

Last night Sara Payne, mother of murdered
 Sarah who has campaigned for access to information about the location 
of paedophiles, said: 'Whose family will this man hurt next?

'Something is wrong with a British 'justice' system that cannot protect children from sex killers. What more do evil people have to do to prove that they are a danger to the public?

'Using our children as tethered lambs for these monsters to exercise their vile inhuman rights is just wrong.'

Oliver was originally jailed for 15 years for his part in the 1985 killing of paperboy Jason.

The teenager was subjected to a horrific 15-minute gang sex attack, instigated by Sidney Cooke, before being  tortured and killed.

His body was discovered in a shallow grave by a dog walker.

Cooke, 87, remains in prison, where he is serving two life sentences. Oliver was released in 1997, after serving just ten years for manslaughter.

He spent several years keeping a low profile, often wearing disguises, as well as changing his name, in a bid to avoid being identified.

But residents drove him out of homes in London, Swindon, Manchester and Milton Keynes after learning who he was. One householder near the Guildford hostel said: 'What are the chances of him attacking a child in this town?

'I've got a young daughter and my wife is scared stiff that he might harm her.'

A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice declined to comment on his case. But she said sex offenders on licence are subject to strict conditions and can be recalled  to prison if they fail to comply with them.

Last night Whitehall sources said it appeared Oliver was freed after just 11 months because that was the normal release point of half his three-year sentence minus time spent on remand.

Oliver was caught reoffending last year by the father of a child he invited into his home.

Families
 living on the same street in Maidstone, Kent, had unwittingly 
befriended the paedophile and let their children visit the bungalow he 
shared with his male partner.

But one father became suspicious and after searching online he discovered Oliver's history.

Kent Police were called and he was arrested on June 7, 2013, for breaching a Sexual Offences Prevention Order imposed three years ago.

He pleaded guilty to two breaches of the order and was jailed for three years.

On one occasion Oliver gave a birthday card to a child, while another time he allowed a boy whose mother was visiting him to use the toilet in his bungalow.
