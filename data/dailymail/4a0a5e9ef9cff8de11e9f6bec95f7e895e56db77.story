Three teenagers frantically used their cellphones to call their father for help from a sinking van after their troubled mother drove them into a river.

Joann Smith, from Florence Township, New Jersey, drove onto a boat ramp and accelerated into the Delaware River on Tuesday night, according to the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office.

The mother, who has battled mental illness for more than a decade, was inside the vehicle with her two sons and a daughter, aged 13, 14 and 15, when she plunged into the water.

They were pulled to safety by a passerby, but before help arrived, the teens used their cellphones to call for help, their father said.

Good Samaritan: Darnell Taylor pulled Joann Smith and her three teenage children from her submerged car after she drove it into the Delaware River. No one was seriously hurt and Smith has been arrested

'They did all the right things,' said the father, Jeffrey Smith. 'I just thank God that they got out safely.'

Jeffrey
 Smith said he received a call from his daughter around 6:30 p.m. on 
Tuesday. He said his two sons in the van were simultaneously trying to 
call 911, but one was cut off when the phone got wet.

Smith said he was about 15 miles away running an errand with the couple's eldest son when he got the call.

But luckily
 36-year-old Darnell Taylor and his wife were driving past - and the car
 caught his eye. He told his wife they should turn back in case anyone 
needed his help.

'I got out of the car and heard people screaming,' Taylor told NBC 10. 'I took off my jacket, jumped in and swam out there.'

As he swam towards the family, his wife called 911.

'I
 couldn't get the window open because the window in the van was not a 
pop out window,' Taylor said. 'So I kept telling the young lady to kick 
the window out and she kicked it out.'

Taylor grabbed the mother and her children one-by-one and returned them to the shore, taking eight trips in total. Smith said nothing to him throughout the rescue except 'thank you', he said.

One of the children suffered a cut to the leg, but no other injuries were disclosed.

Scene: Witnesses say she had bought her children ice cream before driving them off this ramp into the river

Nearby residents branded him a hero, but Taylor insisted that he was not.

'I'm just a member of this community and anyone else would have done the same thing,' he said.

Smith is known by residents in the area and moments before she drove into the river, she bought her 
two sons and her daughter ice cream at the shop across the street.

Jeffrey Smith said Thursday that his wife has been battling mental illness for more than a decade.

Treatments have included hospitalizations and medications, he said, yet it's hard to determine 'when things are going to go bad'. He said he never anticipated a situation like this.

The children are now staying with relatives, according to the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office.

Smith was charged with three counts each of attempted murder and endangering the welfare of a child. She is being evaluated in a medical facility, and her bail was set at $600,000.

She is expected to appear in state Superior Court in Mount Holly on Thursday afternoon.
