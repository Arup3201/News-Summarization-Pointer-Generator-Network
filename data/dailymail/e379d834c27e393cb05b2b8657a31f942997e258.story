A Christmas tree decorated with dozens of garish bows and ribbons has been branded a 'monstrosity' by furious residents who claim it is ruining the town's upmarket vibe.

Locals have condemned the tree - which was decorated by a local business owner - claiming it does not fit in with the posh market town of Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire.

The tree was decorated by cafe owner Andrew Allen at the mayor's request but can barely be seen beneath dozens of bows, ribbons and gaudy decorations.

Many have dubbed it 'blingy', and a 'monstrosity', with some claiming it looks 'like a giant party popper has exploded all over it'.

James Vincent, a lifelong Bradford resident, said: 'I have never seen anything like it.

'There has always been a Christmas tree in Westbury Gardens and I believed that they wanted everyone to have white lights in the town.'

Other disgruntled residents voiced their anger on local websites.

One said: 'I am lucky enough to work in this delightful, quintessentially British town and when I saw the tree earlier this week, I could not believe how ghastly it looks and totally out of place.

'It looks like a giant party popper has exploded all over it. Please change the decoration before Friday.'

Steve Harman added: 'The Christmas tree in Bradford-on-Avon - absolutely appalling, looks like it's been done by a committee of five-year-olds. Take all the decorations off and start again, with white lights only, in the traditional manner.'

Louise Langdon wrote: 'It looks like the wind has picked up rubbish and has blown past and it's got caught in the tree.'

In previous years, the Lions Club have decorated the tree. But this year, its members were only in charge of erecting it.

Mayor John Potter has admitted the decorations (pictured) may need to be toned down in the coming days given the residents' angry reactions

Richard Bloom, from the club, said he was 'dumbstruck by the monstrosity'.

He added that, when the club was in charge of the decorations, it had followed advice from Chamber of Commerce businesses to adorn trees with white lights.

Despite the criticism, Mr Allen, who was asked to decorate the tree by the town's mayor John Potter, remains defiant.

He spent a day-and-a-half working on the tree and said 'a look' just popped into his head and he worked from there.

He added: 'We were sort of fighting against the light to finish the decorations on the top on Sunday but so far we have had a lot of positive comments because it is a bit in your face.

'I think some people will love it and I don't mind if some people hate it.'

Mr Potter described the tree as a 'work of art' but admitted that, based on residents' comments, it may need to be toned down in the coming days.
