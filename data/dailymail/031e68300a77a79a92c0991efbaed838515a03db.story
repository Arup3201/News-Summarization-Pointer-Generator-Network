A woman is being held in jail for assault after throwing peanut butter at her brother even though he didn't press charges. 

Rachel Byrd, 29, was arrested and charged with battery after the fight with her brother at just before 2am on Monday in Deltona, Florida.

The argument broke out over Gabriel Byrd's dog which had urinated in the living room of their house which they share.

Miss Byrd then began to throw the peanut butter spread at her 30-year-old brother.  

According to a report, someone called the police but when an officer tried to call back no-one answered.

A deputy was then sent to the house and noticed the peanut butter running down Mr Byrd's face. 

Despite saying he did not want to press charges, his sister was arrested and charged and is being held without bail at the Volusia County Branch Jail.

To make matters worse, the dog bit Miss Byrd's leg after she threw the spoon at her brother.
