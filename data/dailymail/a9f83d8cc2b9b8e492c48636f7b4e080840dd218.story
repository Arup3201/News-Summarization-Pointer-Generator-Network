Men who said they were kept as slaves on a travellers’ site escaped by jumping into a canal, hiding in a back garden and confiding in a Community Service officer, a jury heard today.

The victims were allegedly held in servitude at the Green Acres site at Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire and forced to carry out unpaid work for the Connors family’s block paving business.

There was a rumour that someone was buried in a field next to the site and workers had been warned: 'If you run away you’ll end up like the person in the field back there,' Luton Crown Court was told.

Frances Oldham QC alleges that the 
Connors family made large amounts of money by controlling and exploiting
vulnerable men. Over 15 years they are said to have kept dozens of 
victims in camps under orders not to leave.

Their
heads were shaved, they were paid little or nothing, were verbally 
abused and on occasions beaten, it was alleged. One worker described it 
as being 'like a concentration camp.'

Mrs
Oldham said: 'A number of words may spring to mind to describe what was
happening. They may not in the strict sense have been slaves but they 
were not free men.'

Luton Crown Court heard that on 11 September last year the police entered 
Green Acres where they found 13 male workers who were not part of the 
extended Connors family.

Seven members of the Connors family, six of who live at the site in Leighton Buzzard, face 20 charges.

They
are Tommy Connors Senior, 52, and his sons Tommy, 26, James, 24, 
Patrick, 20, and Johnny, 28, who lives at The Travellers’ Site, Chiswell
Green Lane, St Albans. Also on trial are his daughter Josie, 30, and 
her husband James John Connors, 34.

Mrs
Oldham told the jury: 'The crown’s case is that members of the Connors 
family - initially father Tommy senior, and gradually over the past 15 
years children Johnny, Jimmy, Josie, Tommy and Patrick and son in law 
James John - recruited vulnerable adults as workers on the pretence of 
offering them paid employment, food and accommodation.

'Typically 
recruitment would take place at centres for the homeless, soup kitchens 
or simply on the street.

'Subsequently
these individuals were held at a succession of travellers’ sites 
culminating in the Greenacres site and were forced to work for the 
Connors family without payment.'

Continuing
her opening today Mrs Oldham told how one man was picked up at Charing 
Cross in London where he had been sleeping rough for 6 weeks. He had 
been offered £50 a day, food and accommodation in a caravan.

After being assaulted he is said to have decided to climb over the fence and run away.

She
said: 'He got over the fence when he heard children shouting: "There he
is". He realised they were looking for him and jumped into the canal. 
There was a fisherman nearby and he telephoned the police.

The area allegedly used as sleeping accommodation. Many of the workers were too scared to escape because of the fear of 'physical violence and the threat of such violence' a court heard

'The
fisherman Peter Hoffman remembers seeing a man running towards him 
bare-chested and being chased by two or three other men. He said he was 
being chased by travellers who had been holding him prisoner. Hoffman 
dialled 999 and allowed the man to speak to the police.

'The
chasing men had stopped by this time and remained watching. Mr Hoffman 
had the presence of mind to wave his phone at them and shouted out that 
he had called the police.'

One
worker was recruited outside Greggs in Wembley, north west London, by Jim and Josie who 
asked if he wanted to work as a labourer for £80 a day, the court heard.
They gave him a caravan to live in with two other men. He was allegedly
told if he tried to leave they would get one of the other men to murder
him.

The prosecutor said he
was assaulted on a number of occasions and was once placed in the boot 
of the car for 40 minutes. While in the boot Josie said that he had to 
sing ‘How much is that doggy in the window?’ and ‘Bob the builder’ to 
her children.

The man, who 
told the officers he never received payment, said the price for work on 
driveways was between £2,800 and £6,000. He said he would work for 10 to
14 hours doing heavy lifting. The only protective equipment was steel 
capped boots, no goggles, gloves or other safety equipment.

When
customers phoned up to complain James John handed the phone to one of 
the workers who would give a false name and promise to come round to 
deal with the problem - that never happened said the prosecutor.

When
working on the site Josie is alleged to have told him to clean the 
toilet by putting his hand down it because there was no brush. 'She said
that this was the way travellers did it,' said Mrs Oldham.

The
man, who had been with the family since early 2011, he told the police:
'Jim and Josie look for beggars and make slaves out of them.'

He
escaped on July 11 while out canvassing for work. A woman in Leighton 
Buzzard found a man in a Hi Viz clothing in her rear garden who said he 
was running away and wanted help.

The woman’s stepson got him out of the
garden and he climbed into the one next door. The woman called the 
police and the man was able to flag down a passing police car.

Mrs Oldham said the jury would hear from another man who said the routine at the site was to get up by 5.30am.

She said: 'Food provided was of the 
cheapest kind. The toilet had no paper and the man and others used paper
napkins from the food they were given. They were allowed a shower once a
week on a Friday evening at the Tiddenfoot Leisure Centre in Leighton 
Centre. In the immediate surroundings of the caravan site where he was 
kept there were iron gates and motion detector lights.'

Another man who had been offered £40 a
day allegedly received no money and had to live with 10 others in a 
horse box. He escaped while doing his Community Service.

'He summoned up the courage to tell 
the person running it that Paddy and the other travellers were not his 
relatives, as he had pretended previously, and that he was not prepared 
to go back to them.'

The labourers were held against their will at a succession of travellers' sites, culminating at Green Acres, jurors heard. Above, a tiny caravan on the site
