Nearly three quarters of countries will not accept passports given 12 month extensions under plans to alleviate the crisis, it has been revealed. 

Home Secretary Theresa May last week announced that expat Britons who need to renew their passports would be given one-year extensions. 

The emergency move announced in parliament was supposed to ease the pressure of the recent surge in demand for the documents that has seen up to 55,000 people at risk of missing their holidays.

Pictures leaked to MailOnline, showing hundreds of boxes of applications piled on the floor of a Passport Office in Liverpool, piled pressure on the Government to introduce emergency measures to tackle the backlog

Home Secretary Theresa May apologised for the chaos threatening to ruin family holidays this summer. She said 11 per cent of applications were not being processed in time

But now the government has admitted only 50 countries have confirmed they will accept the extended passports.

Popular travel spots including Australia, China, India and World Cup host country Brazil are excluded from the list that was published today on the Government website 'gov.uk'. The list does not rule out more countries accepting the extension as a valid travel document at a later date.

The USA, Cyprus and Turkey – which were last year on the list of the seven most popular overseas holiday destinations for Brits – are not allowing the emergency passports.

The latest passport scandal comes just days after Mrs May was forced to offer a grovelling apology to families who have missed their holidays because of the chaos at the Passport Office.

The Tory Cabinet minister said she and the Government are 'sorry for any inconvenience' they had caused by failing to control the backlog in applications.

David Hanson MP, Labour’s shadow minister for immigration, said: ‘A week after Theresa May announced extended passport for residents almost three quarters of the world are currently not accepting them.

‘People are still stuck without their passports unable to travel at what is the busiest holiday period of the year. While it’s good that some will be able to travel on an extended passport, the Government still haven’t got some of the most popular destination countries in the world to agree.

‘Thousands of people will be looking forward to going to places like the USA, Cyprus and Turkey this summer but might not be able to because of the Home Secretary’s passport backlog, and many major business locations like India and China aren’t accepting the extended passport scheme either. It’s just not good enough from the Home Secretary and she needs to urgently get a grip and realise how important this is to people.

‘It’s been months since we first learnt of the passport crisis created by Theresa May’s mismanagement, and yet this news shows again that the government still haven’t realised how serious this is, and simply aren’t doing enough.’

Passport Office chief Paul Pugh, who earns £104,000 a year, told MPs the backlog had hit 480,000 - around 200,000 higher than usual

Around 350,000 passport applications are submitted by Britons living overseas to Her Majesty's Passport Office every year.

In January responsibility for issuing these documents shifted from the Foreign Office’s seven overseas centres to the Home Office in the UK.

Labour say this move has put the Passport Office under huge strain, but Mrs May has insisted the majority of passport applications are being processed on time.

The images showed boxes of applications piled in a spare room set aside for interviews. Officials at the Liverpool clearing house where the image was taken said the situation was 'a million times worse' in Durham

Standard passports cost £72.50 - or £46 for children - and should only take three weeks to get.

Those needing a passport urgently can pay extra for a premium or fast-track service.

The 'premium' service, costing £128, means passports can be collected within four hours of being approved.

Under the fast-track service, costing £103, a passport is returned within a week of the application being approved.

The Home Office has urged those who have already applied not to resubmit their application.

But those that need to leave the country within the next seven days and have been waiting for their passport for more than three weeks can have their application fast tracked for free.

British families abroad can get an automatic 12 months extension - while their children will be given emergency travel documents.

Mrs May said 11 per cent of applications are not being processed within three weeks. 

With the backlog at 493,289 - this means some 54,262 are now at risk of missing their holiday. 

The Tory minister told MPs that the figure was around 50,000.

Speaking in a Commons debate on the passport crisis on Wednesday Mrs May said: 'Her Majesty's passport office is dealing with the highest demand for passports for 12 years while the surge in demand usually experienced during the summer months started much earlier in the year.'

As a result, a number of people are waiting too long for their passport applications to be processed. 

'I would like to say to anybody who is unable to travel because of a delay in processing their passport application that I am sorry and the Government is sorry for the inconvenience they have suffered and we are doing all we can to put things right.' 

But MPs heard that crisis is likely to get worse before it gets better this summer. 

Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: 'We have not yet reached the peak. We actually do need a timetable to get the "work-in-progress" working quickly.'

He also claimed that Passport Office staff were 'profiting from the public's hardship'.  

The Passport Office is making almost £13 on each application and should use the money to deal with the delays blighting Britons' holiday plans, Mr Vaz said.

He said officials should have realised in January that action was needed to avert the current crisis caused by a surge in demand, after being given updated figures by the Passport Office.

'It appears that the Passport Office is making a surplus of £13 on each application. It should not be profiting from the public's hardship.

'There are still 490,000 applications being dealt with and staff have had to work the equivalent of nearly £1 million in overtime in one month. The surplus from last year, and this, should be used to employ more staff to process the backlog quicker.'

Today's Commons debate came after it was revealed that the backlog of passport applications almost doubled in just three months this year.

Passport Office chief Paul Pugh admitted almost 500,000 people are now waiting for their travel documents - some 200,000 higher than last year after a surge in applications in the first five months of the year.

Mr Pugh, who revealed he earns £104,000 a year, blamed a 'substantially higher intake' of applications. Unions said the Government had 'lost control of the backlog'.  

Theresa May ordered hundreds of staff to move from UK Visas & Immigration to the Passport Office, as this leaked letter to MailOnline revealed, to help clear the backlog. But unions said the move would leave other areas short staffed

A spokesman for Her Majesty’s Passport Office said: 'There are currently approximately 480,000 active applications being processed.

'It is not unusual during peak periods for HMPO to operate with high numbers of applications in the system at any one time, with this year seeing the highest levels for 12 years.

'We are working to ensure that the vast majority of people continue to receive their passports within our service standards.

'We have also introduced a range of measures to help those who need to travel urgently, including free upgrades.'
