'Unsophisticated': Jason Rochford was caught after police found his mobile phone and used it to call his mother

An 'unsophisticated' armed robber was tracked down by police after he dropped his mobile phone and police called his mother.

Jason Rochford, 40, has been jailed for five years for threatening staff at Darlington Building Society in Stockton-on-Tees with a knife before running off with £2,500.

He dumped his trousers and a coat close to the scene, but he had left his mobile in one of the pockets.

Police searched his phone and found an entry for 'mam' and they rang her. They turned up at his house and found most of the cash he stole hidden in the kitchen.

Rochford's lawyer described the career criminal as 'unsophisticated' and said he was in debt to a menacing person.

He
got drunk and took ten sleeping pills before he armed himself with a 
knife and approached the lone cashier, barged a customer out of the way 
and passed over a bag.

He said 'give me the money' before holding the six-inch weapon close to the worker's face, adding: 'I mean it.'

Rochford fled from the scene with the money, and discarded his hat, jacket and jogging bottoms nearby.

Hours later, a man spending £20 notes in a nearby supermarket told staff tell-tale details of the 4.30pm raid.

He said the robber had discarded his clothes in Silver Street - just off the High Street - to get rid of evidence.

Defending Rochford, Andrew Turton said he had given it so little thought he did not realise his DNA would be on the bag.

He
told Judge Les Spittle at Teesside Crown Court: 'It was unsophisticated
and, to a degree, impulsive. He had consumed alcohol and drugs.

Jason Rochford 'terrified' staff at Darlington Building Society in Stockton-on-Tees when he went in with a knife

'He was in debt to an individual in the Stockton area. He committed the offence out of fear for himself. He was under pressure.'

Rochford, from Stockton, who has 83 offences on his record, was jailed for five years after admitting robbery and having an offensive weapon.

Judge Spittle told him he had terrified the cashier and customer with the 'substantial' knife and his unpredictable, drunken demeanour.

'I want you and anyone else to know that those who go and commit offences of this nature and arm themselves with a weapon will get greater punishment,' he said.
