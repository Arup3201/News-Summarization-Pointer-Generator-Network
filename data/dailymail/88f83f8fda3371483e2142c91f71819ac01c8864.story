One is a shock rocker famous for his penchant for blue contact lenses and an all black wardrobe. The other is Cara Delevigne's fresh-faced teenage beau.

But for Saint Laurent supremo Hedi Slimane, Marylin Manson and Jake Bugg are the perfect fashion frontmen.

The unlikely pair are the stars of the French fashion house's latest campaign, with Bugg in particular taking to life in front of the camera with ease.

But the 19-year-old singer does have a secret weapon in his arsenal - he was rumoured to be dating model-of-the-moment, Cara Delevingne last Spring and remains friends with the aristocratic beauty.

44-year-old Manson, meanwhile, has been dating American photographer Lindsay Usich since 2012 following his split from actress Evan Rachel-Wood.

In the new campaign, Manson appears in the label's signature L01 motorcycle jacket, which has also championed by fellow rockers Ronnie Wood and Citizens! singer Tom Burke.

Bugg, who is also pictured sporting a rock n' roll leather jacket, strikes a moody pose, glowering down at the camera over his acoustic guitar.

As well as showcasing Hedi Slimane's flair for menswear, the new images are part of the Saint Laurent Music Project, an initiative that combines music with fashion.

Slimane, who has designed costumes for David Bowie and Mick Jagger among others, is creating an archive of images that marry the two.

Previously released images include the photographs of rocker Beck used for the summer campaign and a series of striking shots of Courtney Love wearing pieces from the label's pre-fall collection.
