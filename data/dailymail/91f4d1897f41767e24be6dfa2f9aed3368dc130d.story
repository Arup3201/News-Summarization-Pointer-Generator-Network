Everyone who was at the Riverside Stadium on October 29 2005 remembers the game. Middlesbrough beat Manchester United 4-1 and it appeared – wrongly as it turned out – that years of dominance for Sir Alex Ferguson’s team were about to come to an end.

Roy Keane certainly feared as much and his frustration spilled over when he was subsequently asked – instructed, he claims in his new book – to appear on the club’s in-house TV channel MUTV to talk about a game in which he had not played.

What happened next is embedded in United’s folklore.

Keane’s words were considered so volatile that the programme was never shown and the Old Trafford captain was fined £5000. Weeks later, he was gone.

In his book The Second Half, however, Keane claims his criticism of his team mates didn’t upset a single one of them and that it was only manager Sir Alex Ferguson and his assistant manager Carlos Queiroz who had a problem with his actions.

Aware of what was appearing in newspapers about the issue, Keane called a meeting in the United dressing room and explained to this team mates that – contrary to press reports he believes were leaked by the club – he had not questioned the amount of money they earned.

'It was getting a bit silly so I got the players together in the dressing room and told them it was f*****g nonsense,” he writes.

'They were all going: ‘Yeah, Yeah’. Not one of them had an issue. Not one.

'Even now people still say: "The video had to be destroyed". Like it was a nuclear weapon or something.”

Still Keane had another trial to undergo, though, and it is this that he believes sowed the seeds of Ferguson’s decision to get rid of him.

Called in to an office at the club’s training ground, Ferguson made his captain and the first team squad sit through the programme in its entirety.

Again Keane was convinced the players he had criticised – such as Darren Fletcher, Rio Ferdinand and Kieron Richardson – did not have a problem with him.

'I said to Darren Fletcher: "Fletch?’” writes Keane.

'I had said something about my wife tackling better than him for one of the goals.

'But I could tell he was fine with it.

'But the manager and Carlos were in the back with steam coming out of their ears.

'The manager said: "It’s a disgrace, this f*****g video."'

In his book, Keane makes an issue of matters such as trust and loyalty and it clearly rankles to this day that he was made out to be the bad guy after a programme he never wanted to make in the first place.

'The MUTV people go: "It’s your turn",' he revealed.

'I had to do it.

'I was disappointed with the players but it was MUTV, propaganda for the club.

'So I did the interview.'

Keane believe United painted him as 'loose cannon slagging everyone off'. By midday on November 18, he was no longer a United player.
