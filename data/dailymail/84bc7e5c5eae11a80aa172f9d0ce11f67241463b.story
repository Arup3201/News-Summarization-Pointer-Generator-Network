French football stadiums will fall silent this weekend to remember the victims of the helicopter crash in Argentina that killed 10 people.

Among those that died in Monday's crash were Olympic swimming champion Camille Muffat, boxer Alexis Vastine and sailor Florence Arthaud, who were taking part in French television channel TF1's Dropped show.
