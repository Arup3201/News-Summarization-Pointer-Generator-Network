Gareth Bale responded to his Real Madrid critics with one of the passes of the season and a sensational free-kick in his side's 3-0 win over Espanyol but still couldn't please everyone at the Santiago Bernabeu.

The Welshman was accused of being selfish after Real Madrid's first defeat in 22 games last weekend away to Valencia but there was nothing selfish about his glorious 40-yard crossfield pass on 12 minutes that dropped on Cristiano Ronaldo's toe enabling him to cross first time for James Rodriguez to score Real Madrid's opener.

And then on 20 minutes Bale took a free-kick from 30-yards out and hammered it home off the inside of Espanyol keeper Kiko Casilla's left-hand upright with Ronaldo looking on.

But in the second half Bale raced down the right and when he failed to play in Ronaldo who was charging through the centre the Portuguese reacted furiously shouting 'puta' (f***) and some supporters inside the stadium jeered Bale for having shot wide and ignoring Ronaldo.

After the game, Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti said he will take action if he sees any sign of selfishness among his players.

'Bale has played a very, very good game. He's played with intensity and he's scored,' Ancelotti said.

'It could be that at that moment the fans have asked for a pass to Cristiano which hasn't happened and like all strikers who are in front of goal he tried to score.'

He added: 'Altruism is a very important component of the team this season.

'If there is any play which seems selfish we'll clearly fix it. We have fans who demand a lot. Bale is a fundamental player like Cristiano and for that the fans demand much more than of others.'

Ronaldo who should pick up his second consecutive Ballon d'Or on Monday amost scored the third just before the break but delayed his shot and then failed to find a team-mate with a clever back heel into the area.

Supporters inside the Santiago Bernabeu sang 'Ronaldo Ballon d'Or' throughout and were upset midway through the second half when he was booked for protesting the bizarre sending off of his best friend at the club Fabio Coentrao. The fellow Portuguese international needed treatment after a 50-50 clash with Espanyol's former Swansea midfielder Jose Cañas.

After what looked like a harmless collision that left both players needing lengthy treatment referee David Fernandez stunned everyone pulling out a straight red card for Coentrao while not even showing a yellow to Cañas.

The extra man did nothing to aid Espanyol as they tried to get back into the game. It was after the sending off that Bale's miss – and failure to pass to Ronaldo – came and it was also when substitute defender Nacho appeared at the back post to head in Alvaro Arbeloa's cross from the left.

The win for Madrid ended what had laughingly been called a crisis. They had lost their Spanish record-breaking run of straight wins the previous weekend at Mestalla and then lost the first leg of their Copa del Rey last-16 game against Atletico Madrid. It was suggested the World Club Cup winners badge now emblazoned on their shirts after they beat San Lorenzo in Morroco in December had cursed them but the badge had not weighed too heavy here as they made light work of Espanyol.

They can now sit back and watch Barcelona entertain Atletico Madrid on Sundayat the Camp Nou knowing that whatever the result they will gain ground on at least one of their title rivals. Then on Thursday they will have the opportunity to come back from the 2-0 first leg reverse in the Copa del Rey against Diego Simeone's side.

Before that Ronaldo will expect to be crowned the world's best player once again. On Saturday it was Bale who had done most to make sure Real Madrid took all three points.
