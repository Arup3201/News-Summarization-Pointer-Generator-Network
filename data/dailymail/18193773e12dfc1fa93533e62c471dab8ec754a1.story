The forgotten victim of English cricket’s civil war has dusted himself down, picked himself up and embarked on the new challenge he hopes will help him recover from the blow of missing out on the top job that looked certain to be his.

Ashley Giles was, perhaps, the most unfortunate casualty of the fallout from an Ashes disaster that saw Andy Flower fall on his sword and Kevin Pietersen sacked amid bitterness and rancour that still rumbles on.

Giles, 41, had been earmarked to succeed Flower as team director when he was appointed one-day coach almost two years ago but his apprenticeship was nipped in the bud when England’s world came crashing down.

Ashley Giles missed out on England's top job in the fall out from the Ashes disaster

One of the heroes of England’s greatest modern Ashes victory a decade ago, Giles was unable to stem the bleeding after taking a wounded team to the World Twenty20 in March and he then found himself forced out in favour of Peter Moores.

Now, after a summer of reflection and new experiences, Giles has climbed back on the horse at one of England’s biggest counties and finds himself charged with bringing the good times back to relegated Lancashire.

Not only that, but the man who guided Warwickshire to the County Championship title has also taken on a new and very different challenge aimed at providing him with an alternative career when his coaching days are over.

‘I hurt throughout the summer,’ admitted Giles, when looking back on his own sacking as Paul Downton’s new broom swept through English cricket. ‘It was painful and I was disappointed but I’m not bitter. I’ve got a job to do now.’

The job that Giles looked destined to do was become England coach in a carefully worked out succession programme that started with him taking over the one-day side to allow Flower more time to plan overall strategy.

At the time, at the start of 2013, it seemed the perfect antidote to crazy schedules but it quickly became clear that two very different men with very different ideas would bring confusion rather than clarity.

Test cricket has always been England’s priority and Giles was all too often forced to lead England in limited-overs cricket without important players who had been made to rest by the demands of the itinerary.

Yet he still guided them to the brink of their first global 50-overs title when they reached the 2013 Champions Trophy final and was favourite to succeed Flower when he took the team to Bangladesh for the World Twenty20.

Failure there, and in particular defeat by Holland, cemented the mood for change and Giles found himself on the outside without really being given a proper opportunity to stamp his identity and methods on the post.

‘Was (Holland) the clincher for me? I don’t know,’ said Giles. ‘Momentum seemed to be moving towards Moores before then but it clearly didn’t help. It just about wrapped up all that happened to England in the previous six months which was horrible for all of us. It took some getting over.’

Giles will not criticise the two-man coaching system which saw him lead the limited-overs teams while still being answerable to Flower, but it is clear he felt his hands were tied when he discusses his preferred working methods. ‘What I enjoy is leading my own environment and putting my stamp on it,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘I like to take decisions knowing that they are on my head and that I’m fully accountable for them. That’s the way I like to work.’

He is equally loath to comment on England’s continuing struggles in one-day cricket. Alastair Cook has now been axed for the World Cup in February and England will hope the likes of Moeen Ali and Alex Hales can get them off to a flyer Down Under.

But Giles made an interesting observation on the perceived lack of dynamism when Cook was at the top of the batting order. ‘The most successful one-day sides don’t necessarily start their innings any quicker than us,’ said Giles. ‘But what they do so well is go through the gears during an innings. We’re still having trouble doing that.’

Giles was hurt by the England snub and required a summer of reflection to get over it

Giles will be able to make all the big decisions at Old Trafford as Lancashire’s cricket director and head coach after taking his time in deciding what was next for him.

‘I just didn’t care any more after the England thing,’ he admitted. ‘I needed a break after all that had happened and it was healthy for me to get away from it all. We went on a proper summer family holiday to the US, the first one I’ve had since the kids were born, and I did a bit of media work with ESPN.

‘There was also a charity climb and cricket match at the top of Mount Kilimanjaro which was one of the toughest things I’ve done but also one of the most rewarding.

‘I started to discover what I enjoy again but by the end of the summer I was desperate to get back in the game.’

He talked to Somerset but they plumped instead for Matthew Maynard, the former England Test batsman and ex-Glamorgan coach. ‘It’s great to see him back,’ said Giles. Then the chance came for him to join a Lancashire team who, with delicious irony, had been without a full-time coach since Moores left to take over England at the start of last season. 

Giles was often forced to lead England in limited-overs cricket without important players

‘This is perfect for me and hopefully for Lancashire too,’ said Giles, as he looked out at his new ‘office’ of Old Trafford. ‘I have started working with the players and so far so good. We’re still unbeaten!

‘What strikes me is the size and history of this club. There are similarities with Warwickshire and I feel privileged to be able to lead another big county. Things are pretty healthy business-wise here now and we have a fantastic stadium. Cricket-wise it’s not too bad but there is work to do.’

Lancashire should belong in the first division competing for trophies but they have had an up-and-down time since Moores took them to that elusive Championship title three years ago. Promotion is clearly a priority for Giles but he does not want to indulge in a short-term fix.

‘The aim is to build something deep-rooted that stands the test of time and will be in place long after I’ve gone,’ said Giles. ‘We need stability, consistency and sustainability. It will take a few years to build that. The pressure will be on us to go straight back up but the most important thing is to put in place an underlying structure which will give us sustained success.’ 

England's shock defeat to Holland at World Twenty20 didn't help Giles' predicament

But is there the patience in modern sport, even the traditionally old-fashioned environment of county cricket, for a long-term plan? As Giles found to his cost with England, the demand for results is instant. ‘It’s a balancing act for sure,’ he said. ‘I want to provide a strong pathway to the Lancashire team through all the age groups and plan for tomorrow while looking after today.

‘The temptation is to look at who you can recruit but I want to try to improve the guys under our noses. It’s all very well changing things quickly but that usually doesn’t work and if we bring anyone in they will have to fit in with our values.

‘Social media has made for a society where everyone has a view and there’s a pressure to build very quickly. I hope to be given the time to do this properly. Look at Stuart Lancaster and the England rugby team. I think he’s doing an excellent job and putting something in place that could pay real dividends along the line. But people are asking questions of his results all the time. It takes time.’

Not that Giles wants to spend all his time coaching. Rather than think about a possible return to England in the future — managing director Downton said the job had come too soon for him when he appointed Moores — he has started to look at his long-term future.

Giles is completing a masters degree in sports directorship at Manchester Metropolitan University with a view to taking a wider control of a sporting team.

‘After I’d come round from the disappointment of England I realised I didn’t want to be caught in the coaching trap for ever,’ said Giles. ‘I don’t want to be hitting catches when I’m 50. This course is related to the business of sport and how the science works. It’s a good mix. It’s challenging but really enjoyable.’

So, instead of planning England’s attempt at finally making a mark at a World Cup, which appeared his destiny until he was rudely interrupted earlier this year, Giles has had plenty of other things on his plate.

‘If things were different I wouldn’t have climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, had a great holiday in America and undertaken a masters,’ added Giles. ‘And I wouldn’t be sitting here looking out over Manchester. I rather like it.’
