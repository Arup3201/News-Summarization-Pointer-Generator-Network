Aston Villa have tied Easah Suliman down to a two-year professional deal in order to ward off interest from Bayern Munich and Liverpool.

The 16-year-old signed scholarship forms with Villa in the summer but had still been courted by a selection of Europe's biggest clubs.

However Suliman, who has captained England's Under 17 side, has agreed to commit his future to the Premier League outfit.

Aston Villa academy director Sean Kimberley said: 'We're delighted that Easah has signed his first professional contract with the club.

'Easah has been at the club through his foundation years at junior school and he's a Birmingham lad who's come through the local recruitment process.

'We've been able to develop young, local players over the years and it's great that we can continue to do that with Easah.

'He's going away with England U17s next month and he's continuing to make good progress both with them and here at Villa. 

Suliman, pictured in January 2014, is capable of playing at centre back, left back and in midfield 

'He's at the start of his career now and everything is in front of him.

'The key for him now is to continue to work hard, to maintain the same excellent attitude he has displayed so far and to continue to learn from his coaches.

'Having fought off competition from home and abroad for his signature, everyone here at Villa will help him get the most out of his abilities and we're excited to work with him in the coming years.'
