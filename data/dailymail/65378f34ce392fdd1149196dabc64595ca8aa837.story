Thomas Menino, Boston's mayor since 1993, retired from office in hugely emotional scenes on Monday morning before Martin Walsh was sworn in as his successor.

Menino, 71, held back tears as he left City Hall for the final 
time as mayor to applause from staffers and city workers. He left a hand-written letter and set of keys behind for Walsh.

Boston's longest-serving chief executive, who has battled health problems in recent years, opted against 
seeking an unprecedented sixth full term as mayor of New England's 
largest city.

CBS Boston reported that Menino received a standing ovation as he left the building and one woman shouted 'We love you mayor!'

Menino replied 'Thank you all!' before closing the door to his car and traveling to Logan airport for a week's vacation in the warmer climes of Florida with his wife.

Later, he tweeted: 'Thank you Boston. It has been the honor and thrill 
of a lifetime to be your Mayor. Be as good to each other as you have 
been to me.'

Menino plans, among other things, to teach at Boston 
University in the coming year. But he left a huge legacy in the city he ran for over 20 years.

But as one political era ended, a new one began when Martin Walsh, 46, was sworn in as mayor. 'I will listen. I will learn. I will lead,' Walsh said in his inaugural address at Boston College, his alma mater.

Walsh thanked Menino, who first took office in 1993, saying his 'legacy is already legend and his vision is all around us.'

The new mayor is a former Democratic state representative and a onetime labor leader who called Boston a city of courage, of champions and of big dreams.

He noted that he was once just a kid from the city's Dorchester neighborhood and joked that even his mother was surprised at how far he had come.

Walsh outlined a series of broad policy goals, including improving public safety and ending 'senseless gun violence.'

While noting that the 40 homicides in Boston last year were fewer than the year before, Walsh said the number was still too high.

'No parent should worry that a bullet will stop a daughter or son from coming home,' he said.

'No
 woman should be scared on our streets. No senior should be afraid in 
their home. And no child should be forced to live with trauma and the 
indelible scars of violence.'

Walsh also said he would work to strengthen the economy and create jobs, improve the city's schools and increase transparency at City Hall, including new conflict-of-interest and personal financial disclosure rules for city officials.

He also said he would work to streamline licensing and permitting processes and restructure the Boston Redevelopment Authority, the city's lead economic agency.

Among his first challenges in offices will be choosing a new permanent school superintendent and police commissioner.

Gov. Deval Patrick and U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren were among those who spoke at the inauguration, with Patrick cautioning the new mayor about the pressures that lay ahead in the high-profile job.

'You won't remember precisely the day your jokes became so funny, when you became so photogenic, and when you were expected to have an opinion on absolutely everything,' Patrick said.

Walsh, who overcame childhood cancer and struggled with alcoholism as a young adult, emerged from an initial field of 12 contenders to succeed Menino.

An inaugural celebration featuring the Boston Pops, several bands and local comedians was scheduled to be held Monday evening at the Hynes Convention Center.
