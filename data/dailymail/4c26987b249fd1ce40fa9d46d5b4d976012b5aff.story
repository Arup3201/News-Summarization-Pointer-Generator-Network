For the first time at this World Cup, everyone is on the same page in Germany. That page is the front page of the Bild, which for the last three days has simply been a countdown to Sunday's World Cup Final. Three days to go. Two days to go. One day to go. 

Before the 7-1 win over Brazil, Germany was hardly united behind their team. Coach Joachim Low was criticised at every turn, and many people were frustrated at how drab the football had been.

Now it is different. Now everybody is impatiently awaiting the moment when the clock strikes nine o'clock on Sunday evening, and the World Cup final begins.

Heroes: Germany are one victory away from winning their fourth World Cup title

Rout: Germany thrashed Brazil 7-1 in the semi-final and their nation now expects to be crowned champions

Preparation: The German team train in Rio on the eve the World Cup final at the Maracana

The final countdown: German newspaper Bild

It will be Germany's eighth final, and the whole country is desperate for their team to win it for the fourth time.

The phrase on everyone's lips is 'fourth star'. It refers to the stars sewn above the emblem on the Germany shirt.

At the moment, there are three, one for each time Germany have won this tournament.

Adidas Germany released an advert this week saying that the shirt with three stars is only available for a short time longer.

Above the Berlin headquarters of the SPD, Germany's second biggest political party, there is a banner reading 'Get the fourth star, boys!'.

In all those messages, there is confidence that Germany will, indeed, get the fourth star. After the demolition of Brazil, the nation believes that they are favourites.

There is little arrogance, though. People know how good Lionel Messi is, how rigid Argentina have been at the back in this tournament. They know it could go wrong.

Low and 
his team are also going out of the way to play down any mindless 
euphoria. After the Brazil game, Low demanded 'humility', and that has 
been the party line from the squad ever since.

Philipp Lahm and Thomas Muller have spoken about how well they understand the dangers of Argentina.

Backing: The public, press and advertisers in Germany have all joined the bandwagon

Muller, though, could not resist adding 'if nothing else works, we'll just score from a set piece. We're already world champions in that'. 

For among the humility, there is a powerful optimism. Oliver Bierhoff's statement that all players were fit and ready to play did a lot to alleviate fears. Mats Hummels in particular was a doubt for the final, and many see him as a key to stopping Messi.

'We have a plan for Messi' said Low's 
assistant Hansi Flick on Thursday. Many are confident that it will work,
 and are pointing to the way Bayern played the Argentine out of the game
 last year when they faced Barcelona in the Champions League.

Leader: Manager Joachin Low takes a shot on goal during a training session in Rio de Janeiro

Opposition: Argentina train at their base just outside Belo Horizonte in preparation for the showdown

Many have said that, after he result against Brazil, this German side have already made history. That has helped to loosen the pressure on this team, but the note between humility and optimism that Low's team are striking is a sensible one.

In the supermarket, one cashier wished an elderly gentleman a good weekend after finishing his shopping. 'It'll only be a good weekend if we win the World Cup', he said.

Germany expects.
