Indonesian authorities have postponed the transfer of Bali Nine kingpins Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to the island where they are due to be executed.

ABC News reports that a request from Indonesia's attorney-general has delayed the Australian pair's from Bali's Kerobokan prison to Nusa Kambangan, also known as 'death island'.

The pair were scheduled to be moved tomorrow ahead of their impending execution by firing squad.

But Fairfax reports the delay in their transfer has nothing to do with postponing the execution.

'We are responding to the requests from the Australian government and families,' Mr Prasetyo told the Sydney Morning Herald.

'We want the families to meet with Myuran and Andrew, to give them more time to be with the convicts on death row. This is not delaying the executions. This is just to provide the families with more time.'

Andrew Chan's and Myuran Sukumaran's move to Nusa Kambangan has been delayed

Lawyers for Bali Nine drug Chan and  Sukumaran called for the delay on Tuesday. Todung Mulya Lubis was asked to front the state administrative court in Jakarta next Tuesday, where he is challenging the presidential decree that denied them clemency.

'We are talking about the lives of human beings,' he told reporters on Monday. 'Everyone dealing with this must take all arguments put forward in the clemency petition seriously.

'Rejecting the clemency might end up killing, or ending the lives, of the petitioners.'

The lawyers argue President Joko Widodo's blanket ban on clemency to Chan, Sukumaran and all death row drug offenders, failed to judge individual cases on their merits as required.

Mr Lubis urged Attorney-General HM Prasetyo to halt plans to move the men from Bali's Kerobokan jail to central Java's Nusa Kambagan island, where the executions will take place.

'It's hard to reverse that, once they are moved there,' he said.

'For the sake of justice and fairness I think it is fair for the attorney-general to wait for this legal process to finish.'

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has made another appeal for mercy to Mr Joko, whose hard line on drugs is popular in Indonesia.

Australian barrister Michael O'Connell says Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, remain 'composed and dignified' in very trying times.

On Monday, an Australian woman who has been visiting the Bali Nine for 10 years inside Kerobokan prison described Sukuraman and Chan as 'really wonderful human beings'.

The woman, who did not wish be named, is part of a Protestant church group funded by Australians who help those serving time inside the Bali jail.

As the days appear numbered for Sukuraman and Chan the woman described the atmosphere inside the prison as 'really sad'.

'Everyone is sad right now,' she said.

The visitor said she had many private conversations with the Bali Nine pair and it would be a 'shame' to see them shot dead. 

The parents of Sukuraman were allowed to bypass the regular visitor process

'They're really wonderful human beings. They are the kindest, they are the gentlest, the smartest guys around actually, and that's what so sad because they have helped hundreds and hundreds of prisoners in there [Kerobokan prison],' the woman said.

'Many, many times I have seen and witnessed the many, many things they have done. It would be a very big shame to humanity if their lives were taken.'

Earlier on Monday, the parents of Sukuraman were allowed to bypass the regular visitor process at Kerobokan jail as the family gathered to say their final goodbyes ahead of his impending execution.

The convicted drug smuggler's family arrived at the prison in a black van about 9.30am on Monday and were driven straight up to the visitors' door.

They walked in and out, ignoring the media scrum that await for the family outside who follow them intensely along a three-metre-long path leading to the driveway.

It comes after Andrew Chan's parents Ken and Helen Chan left Bali on Sunday night after saying goodbye for what could possibly be the last time.

Sukuraman's mother and father were followed by a second black van believed to be carrying his family and friends.

It's understood the families of the Bali duo have officially left. 

One woman, who was with Michael Chan told Daily Mail Australia: 'I cannot say anything. Sorry.' 

The convicted drug smuggler's family bypassed the regular process where visitors of inmates need to sign in.

Identification normally must be provided to officials, a form must be filled out with details including the visitor's name, address, the prisoner's name and their relationship to the prisoner.

It seems relatively easy to visit inmates inside the prison. A complete stranger could walk into a visitors registration complex, adjoining the prison, and request to see an inmate.

A number is given to the visitor and they sit in a waiting room to wait for their number to be called.

Regular visitors have warned others of the possible long wait and opt to stand outside the entrance to wait their number to be called.

They tell people what to expect behind the metal door. When visitors are let through they have to hand in all electronic equipment, including cameras and mobile phones.

Officials perform a pat down for security reasons before they let you into a roomful of inmates and their family.

Both men have vowed that their time in jail has rehabilitated them and they deserve a reprieve

Bali Nine member Matthew Norman said it was 'impossible' to speak about the impending deaths of Chan and Sukumaran

The visiting hall is not enclosed but is undercover. Friends and family of inmates are forced to sit on the floor on woven mates while speaking to their loved ones, amongst other prisoners and their guests.

A seasoned visitor cautioned that sometimes people would have sex inside the hall in front of everyone. She said the first time she visited, it gave her a shock to see the sight.

Amongst the prisoners on Monday was Matthew Norman, the youngest of the Bali Nine. He was sitting and talking with an older woman, while leaning up against the wall.

When approached to speak about the impending deaths of Sukumaran and Chan, the soft spoken prisoner said it was 'impossible' for him to be interviewed.

Inside the jail, Norman is shielded from the media pack outside who have been stationed at the prison for about a month.
