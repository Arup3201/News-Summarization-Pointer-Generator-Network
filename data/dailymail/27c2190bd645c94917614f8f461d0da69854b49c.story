Hollywood actress Ellen Page has tweeted her fury about the Queen giving an MBE to a Northern Irish politician who blamed Hurricane Katrina and Aids on homosexuals.

The appearance of Maurice Mills, a Democratic Unionist Party councillor for Ballymena, on the New Year Honours list prompted a foul-mouthed reaction from the Inception star.

Her message on twitter, retweeted over 2,000 times, was accompanied by a picture of the Queen.

It read: 'The Queen honored a politician who blamed Hurricane Katrina & AIDS on LGBT people – f*** that.'

The 27-year-old Canadian actress was referencing two quotes from Mr Mills.

In 2005, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, which killed 1,300 people in the US, he said: 'The media failed to report that the hurricane occurred just two days prior to the annual homosexual event called the Southern Decadence festival [in New Orleans] which the previous year had attracted an estimated 125,000 people. Surely this is a warning to nations where such wickedness is increasingly promoted and practised.'

Mills, who is receiving his MBE for services to local government, also made an incendiary remark about Aids.

He said: 'This abominable and filthy practice of sodomy has resulted in the great continent of Africa being riddled with Aids.'

Mr Mills has never retracted these views and MailOnline is awaiting a response to a request for a comment from him.

John O’Doherty, director of Northern Ireland's largest LGBT organisation, The Rainbow Project, described Mr Mills' comments as ludicrous and his MBE as evidence that homophobia in Northern Ireland is acceptable.

He said: 'I am disappointed Maurice Mills has been awarded an MBE despite his insistence that natural disasters and an epidemic impacting on the poorest and most vulnerable in the world were caused by Gods hatred of same sex relationships. 

'These comments would be insulting if they weren’t so ludicrous. The decision to award Mr Mills an MBE in spite of the comments he made in 2005 is an indication of how little things have changed in Northern Ireland. Homophobia remains an acceptable prejudice in public life and society. The Rainbow Project has reaffirmed its commitment to work with all faith groups in Northern Ireland to engage, learn and address the issues that exist between our communities. 

'We hope that political and faith leaders choose to engage in this conversation and show true leadership rather than cowardly insulting our community from the side-lines.'

TV doctor Christian Jessen also posted an angry tweet about Mr Mills' award, urging his followers to complain about it.

Page came out last year while giving a speech at a Las Vegas conference for LGBT teenagers, telling the audience that she was 'tired of hiding'.

She admitted she suffered for years because she was afraid to come out. She told the audience, 'I'm standing here today, with all of you, on the other side of all that pain.'
