British travellers have been left with worthless tickets and ruined holiday plans after Swedish carrier Fly Olympic AB filed for bankruptcy and cancelled all of its flights and existing reservations.

UK holidaymakers who are abroad without a valid return ticket have been advised to book a flight with a different airline and those with booked tickets are advised to contact their credit card users.

The carrier was not ATOL-protected, meaning passengers stranded abroad will not automatically be given flights home and those with tickets will not be given a refund by the Civil Aviation Authority.

Grounded: Fly Olympic AB has ceased operations despite efforts to overturn its 'financial difficulties'

ATOL protects travellers from losing money or being stranded abroad if the tour operator goes out of business. If a licensed firm goes out of business, the CAA can give refunds to people who can’t travel and arrange for people abroad to fly home.

Fly Olympic AB operated flights from London's Gatwick Airport to Eritrea and Somalia via Stockholm and Athens.

In a notice posted on its website, Asian Pacific/Fly Olympic AB informed customers that it had filed for bankruptcy after 25 years in business.

The company apologised to customers and said it was unable to 'find a solution to our financial difficulties' despite last-ditch efforts to keep it afloat. 

Fly Olympic AB said: 'The new operation to Africa performed dramatically below all reasonable expectations, and the losses sustained were too great for a company of our size to survive.

Passengers who booked directly with the airline via a credit or debit card should contact their card provider.

Passengers who purchased Scheduled Airline Failure Insurance (SAFI) should contact their insurer.

Passengers who booked through a Travel Agent are advised to contact them in the first instance.

Passengers who paid by any other means will need to make a claim request via Economy@FlyOlympic.se as advised on Fly Olympic’s website.

UK customers currently abroad are advised to make alternative arrangements with other airlines.

'We had discussed with several investment groups over the last 10 days in a bid to save the company but unfortunately time ran out.'

An administrator is set to be appointed to take over the company.

The UK Civil Aviation Authority posted a notice on its website explaining how Fly Olympic AB customers can obtain a refund.

The CAA said Fly Olympic AB was not covered by its ATOL Scheme and 'neither the CAA nor anybody else holds a bond or fund to administer claims in respect of this failure.'

Fly Olympic AB operated flights between Gatwick and Africa, with connections in Stockholm and Athens

Would-be passengers who booked directly with Fly Olympic AB with their credit or debit card should contact their card provider, while those who purchased Scheduled Airline Failure Insurance should contact their insurer.

Customers who booked a package holiday through a travel agent are advised to contact the agency.

People who paid by any other means must make a claim request through Asian Pacific/Fly Olympic AB's website.
