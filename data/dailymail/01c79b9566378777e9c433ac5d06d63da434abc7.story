A street performer dressed as Woody from the popular Toy Story film series has been arrested for molesting women in New York's Times Square.

José Vasquez was arrested on Friday night after undercover detectives allegedly saw him grab the buttocks of two women who were having their picture taken with him.

The Times Square Alliance has called for greater regulation of the costumed performers after the 44-year-old was charged with multiple counts of sex abuse and forcible touching.

There are calls for the street performers, who pose with tourists in return for tips, to be licensed after a spate of similar cases.

'This is the latest in a long series of disturbing incidents that reinforce our belief that these costume characters must be licensed and regulated,' Alliance president Tim Tompkins told CBS New York.

Gia Storms, who is also part of the Alliance, added that up to 60 unregulated characters can be found in the popular tourist destination each day.

'Some of them can be up in your face. There a little bit of pushing and shoving to try and get tips,' she said.

In the most recent case, Vasquez was handcuffed and taken to a police station while still dressed in the outfit based on the animated character voiced by Tom Hanks.

The women he is accused of touching inappropriately have not filed a complaint, but Vasquez had his bond set at $1,500 and is due back in court on January 21.

In other incidents, a man dressed as Cookie Monster from Sesame Street allegedly shoved a two-year-old boy in June last year because his mother was slow to tip.

Regulations: The Times Square Alliance wants the street performers, who dress as characters from popular children's shows such as Buzz and Woody, above, to be licensed

An Elmo character from the same series was arrested in 2012 for shouting anti-Semitic slurs and a performer dressed as Spider-Man was arrested in February for allegedly punching a tourist who didn't tip, according to the New York Post.

Some of those who wear the costumes, making up to $50 a shift, say business has been slow because the arrested performers were giving everyone else a bad name.

Mr Tompkins plans to work with the city's new administration to find a solution to regulating the performers, who are protected under the First Amendment.
