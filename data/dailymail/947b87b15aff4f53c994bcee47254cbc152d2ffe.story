The Vermont prep school teacher whose toddler was found alone in her idling SUV over the weekend was killed, a medical examiner ruled today as an autopsy confirmed a body found along an isolated stretch of road was indeed hers.

Melissa Jenkins' exact cause of death was not released so as not to inhibit the investigation, authorities said.

Police did not say whether they had a suspect in their sights, and detectives returned Tuesday to the area where the body was found to collect more evidence.

Discovery: Police have found the body of a missing Vermont teacher whose SUV was found running with her unharmed two-year-old inside

Probe: Melissa Jenkins' exact cause of death was not released so as not to inhibit the investigation, authorities said

'We are 
deeply saddened by the tragic death of Ms. Jenkins, and our thoughts are
with her family and friends,' said the lead investigator, State Police 
Maj Ed Ledo.

'We remain 
committed to solving this case and to identify and bring to justice the 
person or persons responsible for the death of Ms. Jenkins.'

Community members speculated who could have killed a single mother they 
described as kind and helpful, and they anxiously awaited an arrest.

'I just hope they find whoever did it,' said a tearful Marion Beattie 
Cairns, who owns The Creamery Restaurant in Danville, where Jenkins had 
worked as a waitress at night. 'Her little boy - that's what breaks my 
heart right now.'

A makeshift memorial of luminaries - white paper bags with individual 
notes from students on them - lined the entry to a main building at the 
prestigious St Johnsbury Academy, where Jenkins worked as a science 
teacher. The boarding school also serves as the public high school for 
St Johnsbury, a town of about 6,200 about 40 miles south of the 
Canadian border.

Suspicious: Ms Jenkins was listed missing after a friend found her abandoned 2006 silver Suzuki Grand Vitara on the side of a road

Between 100 and 200 students and faculty members gathered at the academy
on Monday night after the news came out that a body had been found. 
Classes were canceled on Tuesday.

'They have a range of emotions, just like me,' headmaster Tom Lovett 
said Tuesday of his students. 'I'm done with the numbness and I'm done 
with the confusion; there's a lot of sadness and a lot of anger starting
to arise.'

Students were writing letters to Jenkins' two-year-old-son, Tyrell Javon 
Robertson, known as Ty, so he could eventually know how she had changed 
their lives, Mr Lovett said.

Jenkins taught science and had served as the freshman girls basketball 
coach at the academy, a school of about 970 students that was 
established in the 1840s and whose alumni include President Calvin 
Coolidge.

On Tuesday, police said investigators had worked overnight. They 
appealed to the public for help, asking anyone who might have traveled 
Sunday night along the road in in a rural section of St Johnsbury where
Jenkins' car was found, or along the road in Barnet where the body was 
found.

Jenkins grew up in Danville, a tight-knit town west of St Johnsbury 
where she attended the Danville School, which has about 300 students.

'All the kids go through K-12 school together. They play basketball 
together. Most of them have worked at my store or here at The Creamery,'
said Marty Beattie, Jenkins' uncle through his first wife, and the 
owner of Mary's Quick Stop a store on U.S. Route 2.

'They've laughed together, they've played together,' he said. 'So it's not all just genetic, but we're one big family.'

Violent crime is rare in picturesque northeastern Vermont but not unknown.

In September 2010, Pat O'Hagan, a 78-year-old grandmother, disappeared 
from her home in Sheffield, about 20 miles north of St Johnsbury. Her 
body was found almost a month later about 10 miles from her home in 
Wheelock.

Police have ruled the death a homicide, but no arrests have been made. 
Authorities have not said whether they believe Jenkins' case is 
connected.
