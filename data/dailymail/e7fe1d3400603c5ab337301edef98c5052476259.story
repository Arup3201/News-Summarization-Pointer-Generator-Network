Alberto Contador has ruled himself out of the Vuelta a Espana after suffering a setback in his recovery from the injury that ended his Tour de France bid.

The two-time Tour winner broke his shin in a crash on stage 10 of this year's race, but had hoped to make his home Grand Tour after avoiding surgery on the injury.

However, this morning the Tinkoff-Saxo rider wrote on Twitter: 'Bad day, the wound healing gets complicated, I've no date to take the bike. Goodbye to the Vuelta.'

The 2014 Tour de France has seen a number of high-profile withdrawals through injury.

Green jersey hopeful Mark Cavendish was forced to retire on the first day of the Tour and he was followed by 2013 champion Chris Froome, Alberto Contador, Andrew Talansky, Andy Schleck and others.

Fans had been hoping for a renewal of Contador's rivalry with Team Sky's Chris Froome, who has targeted the Vuelta for his own comeback after pulling out of the Tour on stage five with a fractured wrist.
