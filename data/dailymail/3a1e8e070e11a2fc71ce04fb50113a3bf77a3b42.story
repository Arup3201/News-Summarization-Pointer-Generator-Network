Levi Johnston is returning to the nest.

The former reality star and teenage boyfriend of Bristol Palin has moved into his mother's garage along with his wife Sunny and the couple two daughters, Breeze, 2, and newborn Indy.

This as the couple reportedly can no longer afford the home Johnston has lived in off and on for the past six years.

Making matters worse for Johsnton is that ex Bristol Palin is asking him for over $60,000 in back child support for their 6-year-old son Tripp (above)

Now, according to Radar Online, Levi and family have settled into their new home - Sherry Johnston's garage.

Johnston was sentenced to three years in prison in 2009 for dealing OxyContin after she sold the pills three times to undercover officers.

The actual arrest happened while her son was dating Palin, who was pregnant, and whose mother was campaigning for vice president. 

'They couldn’t even get a loan for a small camper to live in temporarily. That was their first plan, but four banks denied them,' said a source close to the family.

'They’re not being welcomed with a warm greeting but what choice does his mom have — leave her grandkids homeless?'

And more than a few people claim the couple's financial problems are a result of the way  Johnston's wife has been spending their money.

'She just spends his money on stuff for her - hair extensions, clothes, shoes, expensive makeup, all sorts of unnecessary purchases,' said the source. 

'And it’s all while she tells Levi that the money being spent is going towards clothes, diapers, food for their daughter and food for them. He’s not being a deadbeat dad. He’s such a good dad.'

This as Johnston, 24, is reportedly working every single day as an electrician in Wasilla, Alaska.

His wife meanwhile has been fired from two jobs she reportedly had for just a month.

Johnston and his wife lived with his mother for some time three years ago, and recently the family moved in with Johnston's sister Mercede.

Making matters worse for Johsnton is that Palin is asking him for money for their 6-year-old son Tripp. 

Last year, Palin claimed she was owed over $60,000 for her former boyfriend. 

'Bristol and the Palin family have no clue how broke Levi now is!' said the source.

Johnston's wife is hooting down the source's claims however, writing on her Facebook Tuesday; 'The disgusting things people will say and do out of jealousy... Smh. You wil get yours.'
