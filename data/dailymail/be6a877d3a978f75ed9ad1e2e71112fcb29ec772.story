With energy prices rising, one in eight Australians are struggling to pay their electricity bill, a new survey has found.

The Ernst & Young research found nearly one in three households across Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland have missed a payment in the past 12 months.

While more than one in 10 have missed more than three bill payments over the last year.

The proportion of consumers who were often worried about being able to pay their electricity bill has remained ‘consistently high’ at 70 per cent since last year's survey, according to the report.

Over the last 12 months, 22 per cent of Australians paid their electricity bill late, 32 per cent forgot to pay, seven per cent had a disputed bill, while five per cent said they didn't receive their bill.

The survey found 60 per cent of Australians who were unable to afford bill payment was the ‘single biggest reason for not paying on time’ and one in 10 said energy bills are their top ‘stressor’.

Ernst & Young Oceania Customer Leader Jenny Young told Daily Mail Australia that electricity prices are the most significant cause of financial stress for Australian consumers.

‘Australians are very worried about financial stress in general but electricity bills are one of the key financial stressors,’ she said.

‘Interestingly, we did the same research a year ago and found 73 per cent of households were worried about their electricity bill.

‘The figures dropped down to 70 per cent this year, which doesn’t seem to reduce the point of stress but it has improved slightly.

Ms Young said there is an opportunity for retailers to retain and attract market share by better meeting the needs of customers in monitoring and controlling energy use and by managing 'bill shock'.

The report found one in 10 Australians have, or would consider switching to solar energy

'This research shows customers are looking for simplicity, transparency and the ability to manage their energy use and method of payments.

‘This is a significant opportunity for electricity retailers to improve their customer service and help consumers manage and monitor their usage and bills to be able to pay for electricity.

Ms Young said the survey results provide an insight into strategies retailers can use to assist customers with on-time bill payments.

‘Australians should look at different alternatives because there are quarterly and monthly options and some providers let you choose the months you get paid so you can afford to pay them smoothly.’

The report also found 90 per cent of Australians have, or would consider switching to solar energy.

‘It was interesting to find nine out of 10 Australians were considering solar because it’s worth looking at that alternative,’ Ms Young said.

‘The interest in solar is one of the options to save money and that was by far  the most dominant reason to switch to solar.

‘Not everybody does switch to solar because of the cost of installation but there is significant interest around solar and there are also other options to look at saving.'
