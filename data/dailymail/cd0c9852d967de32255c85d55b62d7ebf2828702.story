A great-grandmother was left embarrassed after having a driveway laid - just after the council had put a lamp post right in front of it.

Pensioner Kathleen Annals had the work done before she applied to have the kerb dropped outside her property in Andover, Hampshire.

And just days before the builders turned up to create the 10-yard driveway outside her detached home council workmen turned up to replace the lampposts.

Blocked driveway: Mrs Annals had the new driveway installed outside her home after council workmen had put up the lamppost

Mrs Annals, who is believed to be aged in her 70s, doesn't drive but had the work done so her family could park their car when they come to visit.

Hampshire County Council normally charge up to £1,200 to drop the kerb - although in this instance it may be higher because they have to move the lamppost.

Widow Mrs Annals, who has lived in her £250,000 home for the last 30 years, admitted: 'Last year they issued parking space permits outside, I have no car since my husband died but I have friends and people come to visit and nowhere for them to park so I thought I should have a driveway put in.

'This lamppost was put in by the council, I had a small wall there at first. The contractor for the driveway said that he was going to put in to the council to have a dropped kerb and he's going to apply for the lamppost to be moved as well.

'He thought he would do the drive first then put in for it to be moved - it's all the wrong way round and now everybody has come and photographed it.'

Mistake: Mrs Annals, who has lived in the property for more than 30 years, has now applied to the council to have the kerb dropped

Flashback: The property with a larger garden before Mrs Annals had a driveway fitted - and before a lamppost was fitted right outside

'I had the work done because there was nowhere for my family to park when they visited me. But I have not got a parking space at the moment because of the lamp post.'

A spokesman for the council confirmed they had now received a request from the pensioner to have the kerb dropped so cars can access her property.

'Clearly this will require the street light to be moved,' the spokesman said. 'We are assisting Mrs Annals with her application for dropped curb including making the necessary arrangements for the street light column to be moved.

'We would normally seek to recover the costs associated with work to lower a kerb or moving a street light. However each case is individually assessed and this is no exception.

'We will ensure that the work to provide a dropped curb and relocate the street light are co-ordinated to keep costs and any inconvenience to a minimum.'
