A man is set to become the first person to visit every country in the world without using air travel - while surviving on just £12.72 ($19.98) a day.

Torbjørn Pedersen, 36, left his home in Denmark at 10.10am on October 10, 2013, and has since visited almost 70 countries from England to Ecuador.

The shipping consultant has vowed to spend at least 24 hours in each nation and won't return home until he was visited all 203 countries on Earth.

He estimates the trip will take more than four years to complete - thanks to the painstakingly slow journeys he must take to visit some nations.

He said: 'I'd grown up believing you need to be a millionaire to reach every country and it would take a thousand years.

'I want people to see they don't need to be wealthy in order to cross borders, meet new cultures and make new friends - I have proved it so far.'

Torbjørn, who became a Goodwill Ambassador for the Danish Red Cross for his trip, survives on cheap street food and sleeps in hostels.

Travelling to each destination on trains, buses, shipping containers and even fishing boats, he believes meeting new people has made it worthwhile.

He added: 'It's hard work sometimes - it's certainly not the Hilton hotel and big steaks every night.

'I want to promote the goodness in humanity. It's not a perfect world, but I believe it is certainly a lot better than most people think.

'A stranger is a friend you've never met before.'

Although visiting war-torn countries such as Syria would be too risky for most tourists Torbjørn believes the trip will be a success but admits he will be extra careful when visiting some places.

Although he has embarked on his dream alone, the Danish explorer has a girlfriend back home who he communicates with regularly using Skype and Facebook.

She has also visited him four times during his travels so far, including last Christmas and New Year in Scotland.

And although it won't be until late 2017 at the very earliest he is already planning his return to Denmark.

He said: 'When I get home I will give my girlfriend a very big hug.

'And then I think I will sleep for a week.'
