An elderly woman died in a horrific multi-vehicle motorway crash today, just hours after the Bank Holiday rush got under way.

The tragedy closed the east-bound carriageway of the M62, near Huddersfield, leading to 13 miles of tailbacks, as a major 999 operation swung into action.

Paramedics aboard the Yorkshire Air Ambulance touched down but the woman died before she could be taken on board despite frantic efforts to save her life.

The great getaway: Traffic delays build up on the M1 motorway at J27 north bound near Nottinghamshire

Most main roads had only minor delays, as many chose to stay at home this Easter because of the bad weather

An air ambulance spokesman said: 
'According to the paramedic an elderly lady was ejected from a vehicle 
and they were unfortunately unable to save her.

'She passed away. She was certified dead at the scene. There were arm injuries. It was quite a traumatic incident.'

Eye-witnesses said a van was coming down a hill near Junction 24 of the motorway when both tyres apparently blew out.

The van cannoned into the central reservation, hurling the rear seat female passenger out into the carriageway.

People depart for sunnier climates at Glasgow Airport this morning. The airport is expecting 75,000 people through its terminals over the 4-day Easter weekend, up 0.7 percent on the Easter weekend 2012

The great escape: Thousands of Britons are set to travel abroad for Easter following the unusually cold weather

An air ambulance was called and 999 
workers gave the woman heart massage and the kiss of life at the scene. 
But she died shortly afterwards.

She is believed to have suffered a heart attack due to shock.

Tragedy struck near Junction 24 of the
motorway around noon. An eye witness said: 'The van was coming down the
hill just and had a blow out on two wheels.

'It skidded and side swiped a Kia Picanto which smashed straight into the crash barrier.

'The van hit the barrier several 
times. As it hit the barrier a rear seat passenger was thrown out of the
back of the van onto the motorway.

Around London the roads were busy as people made the most of their long weekend

The Kia driver - a man believed to be aged in 40s or 50s from Leeds - was treated for chest pains.

Motorists said police cars shot past the standing traffic and cordoned off the scene of the accident.

A West Yorkshire Police spokesman 
said: 'We are dealing with a serious incident on M62 east-bound. The 
east-bound is closed. No further details are available at this stage.'

The motorway was closed eastbound with
traffic queuing from J24, near Huddersfield, to Junction 22, midway 
between Manchester and Leeds.

Almost two million Brits are expected
to fly away this Bank Holiday to escape the Artic chill - around 30 per
cent more than average.

There has also been a rush for last-minute holidays to sunny climes, such as Egypt and Gran Canaria.

Airports and roads across the UK have been largely unaffected by the annual Bank Holiday rush, as many people take 
advantage of the weekend to make long trips.

There are no reported long delays, and flight departures remain overwhelmingly on time.
