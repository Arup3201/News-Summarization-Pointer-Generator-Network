Suspect: Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, faces the possibility of the death penalty if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty

High school friends of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have publicly turned against him as the start of his trial nears.

The Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School graduates said they now have trouble trusting people and are afraid of being connected to the alleged bomber. 

And they blame Tsarnaev for the fact that two of their close friends are now sitting in jail facing charges in connection to him.

Most of Tsarnaev's friends, who had known him for years, only spoke to the Boston Globe on the condition that they could use their middle names - so afraid were they to be connected to him. 

That's not an option for Steven Silva, whose identical twin brother Stephen was arrested for providing a gun to Tsarnaev that was later identified as the weapon that killed MIT police officer Sean Collier. 

Collier was shot dead three days after the Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan allegedly set of two bombs next to the marathon finish line, killing three people and injuring 264 people. 

Tsarnaev, whose brother was killed in a shootout with police, faces charges for Collier's death. 

Silva, who at first posted Twitter messages that said he believed Tsarnaev could have been framed by the FBI, said he no longer believes his former friend is innocent. 

'I don't doubt he did it,' he said. 

Stephen Silva's lawyer said he had nothing to do with the bombing or Collier's murder. 

According to the Boston Globe, federal criminal law specialists expect Silva will appear in Tsarnaev's trial and is likely cooperating with the prosecution in his case. 

Silva also faces unrelated charges for selling heroin to an undercover informant. His most serious charge carries a maximum 40-year prison sentence.

Robel Phillipos, 21, is another former friend of Tsarnaev currently behind bars. 

Phillipos faces up to sixteen years in jail after lying to federal agents about where he was the night Tsarnaev and his brother were on the run.

He later admitted he had been present when two friends removed a computer, a backpack containing fireworks and other incriminating items from Tsarnaev's dorm room while authorities were looking for the suspected bombers.   

Phillipos' lawyers said he was a frightened 19-year-old who was intimidated by the FBI and too high on marijuana to clearly remember what he did that night. The defense called several friends who said Phillipos smoked marijuana a half-dozen times that day.

The Globe reported that Tsarnaev's ex-classmates believed Phillipos to be anxious at the time he made false statements to federal authorities.

One friend, who wanted to be known only as Chris, said he believes he might have reacted similarly to Phillipos and still finds it surreal to see his friend in so much trouble. 

'Robel's facing prison time, and I'm having a beer with friends.' 

The friends told the Boston Globe they believed their friend initially panicked when he was approached by federal investigators. They said they think the prosecutors are being especially hard on him so that  look 'tough on terrorism'.

Another friend, going by the name Junior, said he still supports Silva.  

But Junior said the same cannot be said for Tsarnaev. 

'I can't forgive him for what he did,' he said. 'My heart toward him is ice cold.'

Many of Tsarnaev's old friends said they have trouble trusting people now after they realized they didn't know how much their friend was keeping a secret. 

Only after Tsarnaev was arrested did they learn his parents had gotten divorced and that his brother was involved with a radical form of Islam. 

Chris said he wondered if Tsarnaev left hints of his own change on Twitter. 

He posted one message that said the friends' hometown in Cambridge, Massachusetts could be 'fake'. 

Later that day, according to the Boston Globe, he posted: 'I don't argue with fools who say islam is terrorism it's not worth a thing, let an idiot remain an idiot.' 

The friends have cut off all connection with Tsarnaev. The only thing that still connects them now is their alma mater. 

Chris said he was recently asked during an interview if he knew Tsarnaev because of the familiar high school on his resume. 

He responded that Tsarnaev was merely an acquaintance.     

The defense also called former Massachusetts governor and 1988 Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis to testify for Phillipos. Dukakis, an old family friend of Phillipos' mother, described a phone conversation he had with Phillipos five days after the bombings.

 Dukakis said Phillipos told him he had been questioned by the FBI for five hours but was so confused he didn't remember what he said.

The defense also claimed that Phillipos' alleged confession was coerced by FBI agents.

Phillipos' attorneys said they would ask the judge to vacate the convictions and also appeal the verdict based on their argument that any statements he made to the FBI were not 'material' to the bombing investigation.

Phillipos was charged with two counts of lying during a terrorism investigation. The basis for those charges was nine lies he was accused of telling the FBI during two separate interviews. 

The jury found him not guilty on several of the supposed lies, but concluded he did lie in some instances, leading to the two convictions.

Prosecutors said Phillipos first told the FBI he hadn't been in Tsarnaev's dorm room that day and hadn't seen the backpack containing fireworks, only to later confess to being in the room with two other friends.

The jury, however, found that Phillipos wasn't lying when he told the FBI he didn't see the backpack or fireworks in Tsarnaev's dorm room. Defense attorney Susan Church said that showed the jury 'clearly rejected the so-called confession.'

Phillipos was not accused of participating in the bombings or knowing anything about the planning. Church said Phillipos was 'absolutely mortified' when he learned Tsarnaev was a suspect and had feelings of 'shock and betrayal' that his high school friend could do such a thing.

During the trial, prosecutors scoffed at Phillipos' marijuana defense, telling the jury that he was able to remember many details about April 18 and lied about his activities that night because he knew he had done something wrong.

After the guilty verdicts were announced, at the time U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said Phillipos 'lied to agents when he could have helped' and 'concealed when he could have assisted.'
