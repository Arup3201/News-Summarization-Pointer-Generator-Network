Bayern Munich defensive midfielder Javi Martinez will miss much of the season after tearing left-knee ligaments in the German Super Cup.

The Bundesliga champion says on its home page that an examination one day after the injury 'confirmed the fears' and that Martinez had torn ligaments. Bayern says Martinez will be sidelined for 'at least the rest of this year.' 

He will undergo surgery in the United States shortly before returning to Germany to start rehabilitation.

The 25-year-old Spain international says he is 'very sad,' but promises to come back 'even stronger.'

Martinez was injured in the 31st minute of a 2-0 loss in the German Super Cup at Borussia Dortmund when he tried to take a shot and hit the hip of Dortmund's Marcel Schmelzer.
