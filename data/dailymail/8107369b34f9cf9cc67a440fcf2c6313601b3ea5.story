It has been the royal family's pram of choice for almost a century and for William, Kate and Prince George, it is no different.

Considered 'the world’s most exclusive 
pram', a Silver Cross has carried the Queen, her children, grandchildren and now 
her three-month-old great-grandchild George.

The Cambridges are so attached to their one that they had it flown up to Scotland especially last month.

Tradition: George is carried by his mother after his christening this week, and just like generations of royals before him he is using a Silver Cross

William's own mother Diana spent her earliest days in the luxury buggy being pushed around her family's estate at Althorp in Northamptonshire.

Invented in 1877 by William Wilson, the baby carriages became hugely popular by the 1960s.

Both the Queen and Prince Charles spent some of their early months in a Silver Cross pram.

Television
footage of Her Majesty pushing her children around royal estates in one 
helped turn them into a ‘must have’ baby accessory for the wealthy.

The prams were often spotted being pushed by Norland Nannies wearing their distinctive brown uniforms.

In 1877  inventor William Wilson created Silver Cross because of a lack of suitable buggies for his own children.

He opened a small workshop in Silver Cross Street, Leeds, where he grew the business with the help of his three sons.

In 1913 it became the official royal pram, and a special edition was created and sent to George VI  for Princess Elizabeth, who is now Queen.

After moving to larger premises, an old silk factory in Guiseley, it has grown to a worldwide brand, with more than 10million parents having bought one in more than 50 countries.

But as smaller and lighter prams and buggies came on the market, the tradition Silver Cross model faded in popularity.

The originals are probably considered a tad cumbersome by most 21st 
century parents, and many families would struggle to afford one – let alone get it through their front door.

But William and Kate have stuck with Royal tradition 
and ferry George around in a Silver Cross pram.

Buckingham Palace declined to reveal which model William and Kate opted for.

They might have chosen the £1,450 Silver Cross Balmoral pram which is described as the ‘ultimate classic pram’ by its designers.

Most recently Silver Cross has worked with Aston Martin to create the Surf 007, a £2,000 buggy that will ensure children are being wheeled around in style.

Based on the same design as the rare £1.2million One-77 coupe, it features an Alcantara ultra-soft Italian suede interior, leather-trimmed push bar and aluminum alloy wheels.

The buggy also features air-ride suspension which its makers say will glide over every kind of terrain, and is branded with the Aston Martin classic winged logo on the seat and metal work.

They have created just 800 limited edition Surf Aston Martin buggies, available exclusively from Harrods, saying that the stylish pram is 'designed to perfection with every detail considered'.
