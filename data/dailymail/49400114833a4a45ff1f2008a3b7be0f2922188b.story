A woman who spoils her four dogs with homemade biscuits, treats and cakes, has set up an artisan bakery just for them.

Rebecca Hughes, from Liverpool, Merseyside, had the barking mad idea for Doggy Love Bakery after getting stuck into canine cookery books.

Her pets, who at her own admittance are like children to Becky and her husband Neil, get to go on holiday, celebrate their birthdays - and all four even sleep in the couple's bed with them each night.

Now the four pampered pooches are the first to taste-test Becky's new creations from her bakery.

Becky said: 'At Christmas we buy them presents and I bake them special treats and every year I take their birthday off work to take them on a big day out and buy them a nice dinner.

'All four of them sleep in our bed every night with us and we had to get a super king size bed to accommodate them.

'I also have a tattoo in honour of my dogs, which later became my dog bakery logo.

'Neil and I aren't really interested in having children and so our dogs are like children to us. We adore them.'

Becky got her first dog, Meg, in 2006 from the RSPCA, followed by Alfie and Roxi. She added Dolly to the family just a couple of months ago.

The couple celebrate all their dog's birthdays every year on July 16, when Becky takes the day off work to spend a special day with the lucky pooches.

She said: 'Two of our dogs were born in July a year apart - but we don't know the specific dates so we just randomly picked the 16th and decided they would both celebrate it on the same day.

'When we got our third dog, Roxi, she was officially born in December but we didn't want to leave her out so we just celebrated her birthday on the same day as the other two.

'Dolly was rescued from Romania. We got her from Love Underdogs, a charity that give Romanian street dogs a second chance at a happy life. When we got her passport her birthday was July 15, purely by chance.'

Becky set up her dog bakery in December 2012 after a work colleague bought her some doggy cookery books as a gift a few years earlier.

She said: 'It became tradition that every Christmas Eve I would bake treats for my dogs.

'I started to tweak the recipes to suit their favourite foods, then later started getting creative and coming up with my own recipes and ideas.

'Now I sell my treats via my website and on my stall, which I have at various dog shows around the country at weekends throughout spring and summer.'

Becky comes up with unique flavour ideas based on human favourites, such as minted lamb, gammon and pineapple and peanut butter cookies.

She has even started coming up with treats based on cuisines from around the world including pepperoni pizza for Italy, hot dogs for America and kangaroo flavour representing Australia.

Dog-friendly chocolate birthday cakes with personalised messages are available, and she is working on doggy doughnuts and a possible dog beverage.

Becky said: 'We love to travel and see the world, so we buy the dogs themed toys from the places we visit. This led to me baking treats inspired by countries around the world for them too. We hope to take the dogs abroad on holiday next year so they can travel with us.

'I have some great customers that come to my shows and stock up on treats for their lovely dogs.

'Through my business I support a number of dog and animal charities through monthly donations and when I sell treats at dog shows organised in aid of charities, I donate treats to the homeless dogs currently in the care of the charity.

'At Christmas, we donate food to the RSPCA, where Meg and Roxi are from, and I give out free treats to dogs owned by homeless people living on the streets.'

In September this year Becky is starting an evening class to learn dog grooming so she can expand her business.
