When it was first manufactured in 1948, the Citroen 2CV was seen as an innovative car that could be driven by a peasant.

Nicknamed the 'Tin Snail', it has now become a classic, known for being easy to drive, cheap and simple to maintain.

That's why a group of motoring enthusiasts have clubbed together to modify 16 of the vehicles and race them in some of the world's most stunning locations.

Their first excursion, the Marrakech Express Rally, was a 2,000 mile, 12-day trip around Morocco, encompassing the Atlas Mountains, a number of souks, the Torda Gorge and the magnificent sunsets.

The cars have a measly 29 brake horse powers and can reach speeds of up to 75mph, but were still able to tackle the gruelling terrain.

John Brigden, 60, from Cranleigh, Surrey, who organsied the trip, said: 'They are iconic cars. They are not fast, but people still love seeing them on the road. We just wanted to do something different. They are easy to drive and they hold onto the road well.'

The race, held over numerous stages, was won by former McLaren Team Manager, Alistair Caldwell, who helped James Hunt win the F1 title in 1976.

Cruising: The group drove the modified Citroen 2CVs 2,000 miles over 12 days from Malaga on the south coast of Spain and all over Morocco. The French classic, also known as a 'Tin Snail', has a measly 29 brake horse powers

Held up: A convoy of the 2CVs slow down as a local walks his two camels across the desert. Their journey took in various terrains including sand, gravel, mud and tarmac

Surface: The team, who wanted to do something 'completely different', aimed to visit the roads less travelled

Snow-covered mountains: The fleet of 16 cars, which were modified using parts bought off eBay, were set different tasks on different days of the race. They included time trials and average speed tests

The first design by Pierre Boulanger in the early 1930s was for a low-priced, rugged 'umbrella on four wheels'.

The aim was that two peasants would be able to drive 100kg of farm goods to market at around 40mph, wearing clogs and across muddy unpaved roads if necessary.

But when it was first manufactured in France in 1948, it was considered technologically advanced, innovative and stood out with its unconventional appearance.

It featured four-wheel suspension, front wheel drive, inboard brakes, and even detachable body panels.

Car Magazine journalist L.J.K Setright described it as: 'The most intelligent application of minimalism ever to succeed as a car.'

The 2CV also became a huge commercial trimpuh

After just a couple of months on sale, there was a three-year waiting list.

Production was increased from four units per day in 1949 to 400 units per day in 1950. Some of the early models were built at CitroÃ«n's plant in Slough, England.

After nearly 50 years, the last was produced in 1990 and driven out of a Mangualde, Portugal where manufacturing had moved. More than 5 million were produced.

Upgrade: The group of motoring enthusiasts and former racing drivers installed roll cages into the cars which have a top speed of around 75mph

After dark: Drivers park one of the 66-year-old cars on a hill in order to watch the sunset over the desert

Rubble: The cars took on narrow roads surrounded by rocks. The route included passes over the Atlas Mountains and the Torda Gorge

Cliff: The cars, which are nearly 70 years old, had to navigate sharp turns surrounded by steep drops

Spectators: Locals greeted them as they wove through a remote village. A support crew followed the vehicles to make sure they stayed on the road

Difficult terrain: The cars are parked up as the team climb to the top of a sand dune in the middle of the desert. The team carried wheel-rims - 102 in total - tyres, engines and gearboxes during the trip

Overtake: On the tarmac roads they covered during the trip, they passed other forms of transport, including a donkey being led by a local

Wildlife: The team met companions during the trip, including a monkey on the side of a road. The team said they had limited mechanical problems during the journey

Entrance: One of the cars passes through a gate outside the desert town of Tazzarine, en route to the sandy roads of Morocco

Architecture: Another vehicle passes through the archway of a desert town. Special stages tested the cars' abilities to maintain an average speed over a distance

Causing a splash: A lead car drives through a puddle on one of Morocco's rural roads. The race was won by former McLaren Team Manager, Alastair Caldwell, who helped James Hunt to an F1 World Championship victory in 1976

Winding road: A sign warns the drivers of the potential obstacles that lie ahead on the stage. The cars were painted red and white for the trip and given special branding

Team photo: Each of the drivers stand out of the 2CV's open roofs as they stop at a hotel for the night

Weaving: The team had to dodge ruined, derelict buildings in the desert as they braved temperatures in excess of 30C

Speed: Even though the car struggles to reach 30mph, it was captured dashing across the desert by one of the group's photographers

Convoy: The team follow each other on one of the rare, two-lane, tarmac roads dissecting a remote part of North Africa

In a flash: The group behind the Marrakech Express said they wanted to explore the relatively untouched routes around Morocco

Break: Alastair Caldwell, who rose from a cleaner to Team Manager in the McLaren F1 setup, steps out of the car to refill the petrol tank
