A single police force arrested 2,000 criminal suspects from 100 different countries in just 12 months, new figures have revealed.

Details of the arrests, revealed in a Freedom Of Information Act request to Kent Police, have prompted criticism over the country's free borders and a lack of control over who is allowed to enter the UK.

The majority of non-UK citizens held for 
crimes in the county have come from Eastern Europe - particularly 
Lithuania and Poland, the figures for 2012 to 2013 reveal.

The figures show that 13 per cent of those arrested and charged last year were born abroad.

And six per cent of the total arrested were from Eastern Europe, including 230 Lithuanians, 213 Poles, 208 Romanians, 162 Slovaks and 79 Czechs.

Polish nationals have been the largest non-UK community in Kent for many years, with the latest census, carried out in 2011, revealing there were 10,357 Polish people in the county.

The
 numbers of Bulgarians and Romanians is now expected to rise after 
access restrictions to the UK labour market were lifted for migrants 
from both countries.

In
 the light of these changes it has been predicted that as many as 50,000
 people from those two nations will head to the UK every year to live 
and work.

Altogether 14,842 people were arrested and charged with at least one offence in the county in the 12 months from October 2012.

The highest number of those arrested (12,960 or 87 per cent) were UK citizens.

With a number of ports including Dover and Folkestone, officers in Kent have become accustomed to arresting people from all corners of the globe, including such far-flung places as Nigeria, India and Afghanistan.

Ukip councillor Cllr Lee Burgess, Kent County Council representative for Swale Central, said: 'No one nationality is more disposed to committing crime than any other.

'But it's logical that if Bulgarians and Romanians start making up a larger proportion of the population, then the crime statistics will go up among those communities.

'I'm more concerned that free borders means we will have no control over who comes here.

'We may get the doctors and nurses we need and rely on, but we might also get the undesirables which we can send back, but can't stop coming back.'

A Kent County Council spokeswoman said the arrival of migrants from around the world had for some time put pressures on local services.

She said: 'Part of the reason for the wide variety of people settling in Kent is because of the Channel ports and also because of the county's closeness to London.'

Port of call: Kent is home to the busy Port of Dover, through which many migrants arrive in the UK
