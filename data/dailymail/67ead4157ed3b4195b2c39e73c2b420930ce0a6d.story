The death of a medical school graduate from the Bahamas while in police custody in New London, Connecticut, has been ruled a homicide, but authorities say that doesn't mean the officers committed any crime.

The Day newspaper reports the chief medical examiner's office ruled recently the October death of 31-year-old Lashano Gilbert was a homicide caused by a fight with police that led to complications with what appeared to be a sickle cell disease condition.

Police say Gilbert was arrested for an attempted carjacking and died after fighting with officers and being zapped with a stun gun twice within eight hours.

Homicide: The chief medical examiner's office ruled recently the October death of 31-year-old Lashano Gilbert was a homicide death complicated by a sickle cell anemia condition 

Officers first subdued the 31-year-old when his arrest turned to a struggle. They did so again when he attacked officers in the police station. 

State police are still investigating Gilbert's death. 

Gilbert reportedly told police he was hearing voices and when he behaved in a threatening manner toward them, they used the stun gun.

He was taken to a hospital and treated, then taken to a New London police station.

Police say while in a holding cell Gilbert began twisting his pants as if to make a noose. He bum rushed police when they opened the cell to take the pants.

In the commotion, Gilbert was tasered a second time. He was rushed to the hospital again and died around 3:30am Saturday. 

New London's state's attorney and New London police chief immediately asked the state police to start an investigation, according to NBC Connecticut. 

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sickle cell is an inherited red blood cell disorder which can block blood flow and cause pain and other serious problems such infection, acute chest syndrome and stroke.

Gilbert’s cousin, Kasi Fletcher told The Day that the family is struggling with the news.'It’s hard to hold back the emotions with something like this,” Fletcher said. “We’re all still pretty much in shock. We passed the word along to (Gilbert’s) mother. She just wants justice.”

Fletcher said the family has heard very little in the way of remorse from town officials or police about Gilbert’s death.

'Not a word,' Fletcher said. 'Crickets.'

The homicide ruling means Gilbert's death was at least in part caused by another person.

Gilbert's family says it learned about the results last week.

Local police union President Todd Lynch said Friday officers have been  criticized for simply doing their jobs.

'There are some situations that our officers must respond to,' Lynch said. 

'We cannot run away. We cannot call anyone else for assistance. We have to act. No matter what color, creed, sexual orientation, religion, anything. That’s what our officers did that night.'

'None of those officers involved wanted to go home that night thinking their actions caused the death of someone. Nobody wants this to happen,' Lynch said.
