The Twitter account of Take That star Gary Barlow was hacked yesterday with an offensive message posted about his stillborn child. 

Barlow was targeted by an 
internet troll who posted the disturbing message after a court ruling that the singer had invested in a massive tax 
avoidance scheme.

The 
message, which is too offensive to repeat, was removed after eight 
minutes but in that time had been re-tweeted hundreds of times.

The Take That singer was awarded the OBE for 'services to the entertainment industry'

Barlow and his wife Dawn lost their fourth child, a daughter called Poppy, who was stillborn in 2012.

The Manchester Evening News reported a spokesman for Barlow confirmed his Twitter account was hacked on Monday lunchtime.

The news comes as David Cameron yesterday insisted that he should be allowed to keep his OBE, despite a court ruling 
that he had invested in a massive tax avoidance scheme.

The
 Take That star – and prominent Tory supporter – has faced a barrage of 
criticism, with MP John Mann branding him ‘unethical’ and others calling
 for him to hand back the honour. But Mr Cameron believes the measure is
 unnecessary.

Prime Minister David Cameron said it is not 'necessary' for Barlow to hand back his OBE

The Prime Minister insisted the singer had 'done a huge amount for the country' including raising money for charity.

Tory-supporting
 Barlow, 43, and bandmates Howard Donald, 46, Mark Owen, 42, and their 
manager Jonathan Wild, poured £66million into Icebreaker Management, 
which styled itself as a music industry investment scheme.

However a judge ruled last week that it was in fact a tax shelter designed to help the super-rich avoid paying income tax. The band members  – of which Barlow was the biggest investor – are now likely to face repaying £20million to HMRC.

Margaret Hodge, the Labour chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, claimed Barlow 'might want to show a bit of contrition by giving back his OBE'.

But Mr Cameron rejected the idea. He told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I don’t think that’s necessary frankly. Gary Barlow has done a huge amount for the country, he’s raised money for charity, he’s done very well for Children in Need so I’m not sure... 

'The OBE was in respect of that work and what he’s done but clearly what this scheme was was wrong and it’s right that they’re going to pay back the money.'

Mr Cameron said he was against aggressive tax avoidance schemes, and it was right that Barlow and the other Take That stars returned the money

London Mayor Boris Johnson also insisted the singer should be allowed to keep his gong. He told BBC News: '

Should Gary Barlow lose his OBE following his multi-million pound tax dodge?

'We will 
want to see him coughing up in the same way as everybody else. But I 
don’t think as far as I understand the matter that he’s done anything 
illegal, has he?

'As
 far as I’m concerned there aren’t any criminal charges against him or 
whatever. I think he should cough up but on the OBE question that people
 keep asking me, I don’t think there’s any need for him to hand back his
 OBE.' 

Barlow backed the Tories at the last election, joining Mr Cameron just weeks before polling day at a policy launch. 

It
 is believed the Take That stars were able to avoid tax on about 
£63million from world tours and CD sales. They were among nearly 1,000 
people who contributed £300million to 62 partnerships.

But
 a tax judge found that 51 of the Icebreaker investment partnerships, 
which were formed between 2004 and 2010, hadn’t made any profit at all –
 despite investing in a range of musicians including Sinead O’Connor.

It was also revealed that HMRC has been trying to shut down the scheme for years. 

Barlow joined David Cameron on the campaign trail in the run-up to the 2010 general election, backing Tory plans for an X-Factor-style school singing contest. Asked if he was supporting the Conservatives, Barlow replied:  'I would not be here if I was not.'

Gary Barlow
 has spent more than 20 years in the public eye, rising from boyband to some calling him a national treasure.

He was Take That's lead singer when the band was formed in 1989, alongside Howard Donald, Jason Orange, Mark Owen and Robbie Williams.

When the band split in 1996, his solo career was eclipsed by Williams. It was not until the band reformed in 2005 that Barlow achieved the status of national treasure.

In 2010 he surprised many by joining David Cameron at a Tory party policy launch less than a month before the 2010 general election.

Asked if he was backing the Conservatives, Barlow replied: 'I would not be here if I was not.'

He served as a judge on three series of X Factor, and confirmed his place in the musical establishment when he organised the Queen's Diamond Jubilee concert in June 2012 - which featured a 
host of stars including Stevie Wonder and Sir Paul McCartney who played 
to a televised audience of millions.

He returned to 
Buckingham Palace in November 2012 to be awarded his OBE by the Queen.

He was given the honour for services to the entertainment industry and to charity.

Barlow
 masterminded the Queen's Diamond Jubilee concert - staged at the Palace
 during a special bank holiday weekend in June 2012 - which featured a 
host of stars including Stevie Wonder and Sir Paul McCartney who played 
to a televised audience of millions.

The
 anthem Sing, co-written with Andrew Lloyd Webber, and featured at the 
Jubilee concert, topped the singles charts during the summer and his OBE
 was announced days later in the Queen's Birthday Honours.

His
 charity work includes gathering a team of celebrities to climb Mount 
Kilimanjaro in 2009 for Comic Relief and organising charity concerts for
 Children in Need in 2009 and 2011.

The Prime Minister added: 'I’m against these aggressive tax avoidance schemes but I’m not just against them, this Government has taken a huge amount of steps to legislate and toughen the laws and go after aggressive tax avoidance schemes for the very simple reason that if people go after these schemes and aggressively avoid tax they’re making it the case that everyone else has to pay higher taxes as a result.

'So I think we should be very clear, tax evasion is illegal and for that you can be prosecuted, you can go to prison for tax evasion. 

'Tax avoidance is in these cases, very aggressive tax avoidance schemes, they are wrong and we should really persuade not to do them and that’s why we have these court cases where the court looks at whether a scheme is really about avoiding tax rather than anything else and the court was very clear in this case.'

Judge Colin Bishopp said: ‘Icebreaker is, and was known by all concerned to be, a tax avoidance scheme.

'The aim was to secure [tax] relief for members, and to inflate the scale of the relief by unnecessary borrowing.’

He added: ‘No serious or moderately sophisticated investor seeking a profit... would rationally have chosen an Icebreaker partnership.’

Insiders say the judgment on Friday took the stars by surprise, and there is speculation Take That will have to launch another tour to raise funds.

There is no suggestion, however, that other band members Jason Orange and Robbie Williams were involved in the scheme.

Last night Labour MP John Mann, who sits on the Commons Treasury select committee, said the bandmates had no grounds to complain if they were forced to pay back a  crippling sum.

He said: ‘They should pay their taxes the same as everyone else.

'The people who buy their records pay tax. It is unethical to avoid paying what you owe.

'Barlow should put a cheque in the post.’

Yesterday, fans vented their anger and called for Barlow to be stripped of his OBE, which he was given in 2012 for services to music and charity.

One joked on Twitter: ‘Gary Barlow to swap OBE for IOU.’ 

Another said: ‘Did Gary Barlow “Take That” too literally?’

Tory MP Stewart Jackson, who sits on the public accounts committee, said: ‘This case shows that however famous people are, they must pay their fair share of tax.’

Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'People who don't pay the taxes that they should undermine the economy, damage our public services and place an extra, unfair burden on hard-working families and companies who play by the rules.'

Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke told the Times newspaper: 'People who have seriously abused the tax system should be stripped of their honours.'

The 
group’s spokesman declined to comment yesterday – but it was reported 
that Barlow believed he ‘was not given the full picture’ about the 
scheme.

Icebreaker’s
 spokesman said: ‘Icebreaker Management is extremely disappointed with 
this decision  and will consider all the options, including appeal.’

A
 spokesman for HMRC said: ‘HMRC has put in place generous reliefs to 
support genuine business investment... But we will not tolerate abuse of
 the system by people trying to dodge their tax obligations.’
