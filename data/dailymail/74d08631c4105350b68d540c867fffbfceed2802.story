An NYPD officer who was filmed using possible excessive force is on paid sick leave following the incident.

Evans Mazile repeatedly hit Donovan Lawson, 20, with his baton after the boy allegedly doubled up with his 15-year-old girlfriend while going through the turnstile at the Myrtle subway stop in Brooklyn on November 20, thus not paying his toll.

After the young man refused to produce identification for the officer, Mazile said he would have to arrest him.

Bad scene: Lawson, who allegedly entered a Brooklyn subway station without paying the fare, was treated at a hospital and then sent to Rikers

That's when Lawson got upset and pleaded with the officer not to arrest him according to DNA Info, saying that he was on probation following a robbery charge.

Then, when Mazile grabbed Lawson and told him to sit down, a request the boy refused, things suddenly took a turn for the worse.

'Mazile punched Lawson several times in the face and even tried to overwhelm him by spraying him in mace, but Lawson blocked it with his hands,' said multiple sources. 

'Then Mazile pulled out his baton, slamming Lawson on the head with enough force that the sound of the blow was clearly recorded by several shocked straphangers.'

In both video and photos, it is clear that Lawson is bleeding profusely.

Both men ended up being taken to the hospital, with Lawson then going to the New York City prison facility on Rikers Island and  Mazile going on a sick leave that has been paid and so far lasted three weeks.

Blood: Lawson was hit so hard that his blood covered the floor of the subway and got on bystanders

Now, an investigation is being launched into the incident.

Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson is probing to see if too much force was used and if evidence should be presented to a grand jury.

Lawson has been charged with  trespassing, resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration and theft.

At the time he was on parole for a robbery that occurred in February 2013 in which he punched and pull a BB gun on someone before stealing their cell phone and cash, for which he spent 18 months in prison.

He has chosen to go to trial on the current charges rather than take a plea.

As for Mazile, he has had eight previous Civilian Complaints against him, one of which came after he reportedly used excessive force while hitting a suspect in the head.
