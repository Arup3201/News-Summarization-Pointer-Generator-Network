The Texas Republican party are now endorsing so called restorative therapy to 'cure' homosexuality.

At their annual conference in Fort Worth on Saturday, the party adopted the policy, which tea party groups had advocated.

One particularly influential group, the Texas Eagle Forum, had urged the party to support the psychological treatments, which claim to try and turn homosexuals straight.Â

A same-sex marriage rally was held outside the Fort Worth Convention Centre on Thursday before the Texas Republican party conference

Before the convention began on Thursday, a same sex marriage rally was held outside the convention centre in Fort Worth, where the conference took place.

But before 7,000 delegates, the party agreed to adopt the platform which states they recognise 'the legitimacy and efficacy of counselling which offers reparative therapy and treatment for those patients seeking healing and wholeness from their homosexual lifestyle.'

President of the conservative group, Texas Values Jonathan Saenz welcomed the decision saying it comes as no surprise.

Treatments for 'curing' homosexuality claim to change a person's sexuality through techniques such as electric shock therapy, inducing nausea while being exposed to homoerotic material, praying, exorcism, trips to brothels to have sex with women, and hypnosis.

Some advocates of the therapy have also asserted that prayer and religious faith can be helpful in suppressing or overcoming same-sex attractions.

The American Psychological Association have warned that the therapies run the risk of causing serious psychological harm.

Gay rights groups agree saying the therapy damages young people, because it tells them that it's not acceptable to be whoever they are.

The largest Christian ministry engaged in such work, Exodus International, also closed last year and its leader apologised to the gay community for inflicting 'years of undue suffering.'

California and New Jersey have both passed laws barring licensed therapists from trying to turn gay youth straight, and both laws have been upheld in court.

He explained: 'The platform reflects what the people in the Republican Party have asked for, and that should be no surprise: family values, protection of marriage between one man and one woman and everything that goes along with that.'

But adopting the policy has sparked controversy even amongst members of the Republican party, some of whom had been lined up to speak out against endorsing such therapy.

They never got the chance to address delegates, because a parliamentary motion to approve the full platform was called first.

Rudy Oeftering, vice president of the gay conservative group Metroplex Republicans, who was due to speak said: 'There's a very, very small group of people who want to keep the party in the past. We were here today to try to pull the party into the future.

'The only 
way the party can go into the future is to start listening to young 
people, to start listening to people who have gay family members.'

Reparative
 therapy or conversion therapy, uses a number of techniques to try and 
change a person's sexual orientation or lessen their interest in 
engaging in same-sex sexual activity.

The
 American Psychological Association and other major health organizations
 have condemned the counselling, with other groups saying the practice 
should not be used on minors because of the danger of serious 
psychological harm.

California and New Jersey have both passed laws barring licensed therapists from trying to turn gay youths straight, and both laws have been upheld in court.

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican, signed the ban in his state against the wishes of some conservatives, saying the health risks entailed in trying to change a child's sexual orientation overrode concerns about parental choice.

However, Gay conservatives did come away with a rare victory at the convention, winning the removal of decades-old language in the state party platform that states, 'homosexuality tears at the fabric of society.'
