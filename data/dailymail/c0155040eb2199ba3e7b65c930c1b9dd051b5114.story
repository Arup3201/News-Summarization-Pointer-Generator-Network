From up on high, it looks stunning: an inland sea dotted with the occasional ancient church tower and hill settlement.

It probably looked much like this when Alfred the Great was burning his cakes and outsmarting the Danes on a little hillock called Athelney, a mile or so from where I am standing. Back then, it was called the Isle of Athelney. Today, it is cut off by the waters once more.

But there’s nothing pretty or enchanting about all this down at ground level. When the breeze falters, you catch a whiff of uncorked septic tank. The high water mark is lined with grime.

Swamped: Farmer Julian Temperley shows Robert Hardman his father's home in Thornley, Somerset yesterday where the ground floor rooms have been ruined by muddy water

‘Make sure you wash your hands before you eat anything,’ says the fireman driving the emergency ferry from the ‘mainland’ to the medieval villages of Muchelney and Thorney. The one thing these firemen are unlikely to encounter is a fire.

This 65million cubic tons of filthy water is barely moving. ‘We’ve seen it all washed up outside – condoms, syringes, worse ...’ says James Winslade of Winslade Farm, eight miles to the west. ‘I can’t let the children out in the garden because of what’s out there.’

It is a grim but neat symbol of the chaos afflicting this historic swathe of Somerset: for this is not a natural phenomenon. Nearly 30,000 acres are submerged, but this is a man-made problem with man-made symptoms and it will require man-made solutions.

No one in this part of the world seems in any doubt about who is to blame: the elusive quangocrats of the Environment Agency. Their new orthodoxy is that everyone should stop interfering and let things take their natural course. 

It’s an attractive idea if you are 
ticking environmental boxes in Whitehall – or if you are a water vole. 
If you are watching your home, your family business, your children’s 
birthright sink before your eyes, it is a disgrace.

Making do: Residents are ferried from Thornley to Muchelney by farmer Graham Walker. 20 per cent of the entire county of Somerset is submerged by floodwater

There
 is nothing new about flooding on the great plains known as the Somerset
 Levels – as King Alfred would testify. From the Romans to medieval 
monks to 17th century Dutch engineers to Second World War prisoners, 
people have been building banks, ditches and sluices to drain this part 
of the countryside and grow things.

Every
 winter it would flood for a bit and then drain away. Once in a 
lifetime, the flooding would be very bad indeed and over-run a few 
homes. That was simply the risk you took when you lived on the Levels.

The trouble is, there was a ‘once in a lifetime’ flood last winter, in November 2012. And now this one’s even worse.

The people of Somerset are unanimous in what has needs to be done. They point out that the Environment Agency stopped dredging the rivers and flogged off the dredging machinery 20 years ago. Now it’s payback time.

‘Start dredging again!,’ says every single person I meet from one end of this 20-mile lake place to the other.

‘If your bathplug is clogged with hair, then you unclog it,’ says Julian Temperley, farmer and father of leading fashion designer Alice, as he takes me by tractor to the home of his 98-year-old father (now safely evacuated).

The water is black and knee-deep in the kitchen. It’s uninhabitable. We had dredging for generations and houses didn’t flood. Then they stopped dredging and look what happens!’

He points out that it took military expertise to resolve that ghastly epidemic of foot and mouth disease in 2001. ‘I’d have greater faith in the Environment Agency if there was a brigadier in charge of it.’

‘If you let your gutters get blocked, you get trouble,’ says a regular at the bar of the King Alfred Inn at Burrowbridge. Just outside, an extraordinary hill called the Burrow Mump offers a superb panoramic view of the problem. Landlady Sally Taylor makes a telling observation.

Flood water is pumped into the River Parrott by the Environment Agency in Moorland, Somerset, England. Environment Agency Chairman Lord Smith, the chairman admits dredging is likely to be part of the plan to reclaim flooded land

In the old days, when the waterways dried out, they used to be U-shaped thanks to dredging work. Now, they are V-shaped. By the Environment Agency’s own admission, the capacity of the River Parrett, a few yards away, is down by 40 per cent.

The water is seeping up through the flagstones below the pool table, but it’s business as usual. In fact, the place is buzzing. On an adjacent table, I meet three other members of the Temperley family.

‘We’ve always had flooding, but not like this,’ says Diana Temperley, Julian’s wife. It’s a birthday pub lunch for elder daughter, Mary, 36, a mother of two, but the talk is of ruined apple crops and marooned sheep. Younger daughter Matilda, 32, a photographer, has been capturing images of these floods for weeks.

‘The Environment Agency are trying to blame all this on extreme weather, but the weather is not that unusual,’ she explains. ‘It’s just the water has nowhere to go.’

Another group of locals walk in with matching sweatshirts. They all say: ‘Start dredging.’

I contact the Environment Agency ,where a spokesman reiterates the official line: ‘Increased dredging of rivers on the Somerset Levels would not have prevented the recent widespread flooding because of the sheer volume of rainfall.’

Yesterday, we heard the head of the Environment Agency, Lord [Chris] Smith, a former Labour minister, argue that these floods are a complex issue and, thus, there are no easy answers.

Widespread: Flood waters surround farm buildings in Moorland, Somerset. An area the size of 40 sq miles of the Somerset Levels remains flooded

Left behind: Debris washed up by flood water is seen at James Winslade's farm in Moorland, Somerset

Almost knee-deep: Farmer James Winslade stands in front of bales of animal feed as he surveys flooded land at his farm in Moorland, Somerset

Around here, the mere mention of his 
name invokes snorts of derision. ‘Inner city MP, wasn’t he?’ says farmer
 Graham Walker, giving me a lift on the tractor ferry with which he has 
been taking people in and out of Thorney.

Graham
 has another bone to pick with officialdom. The county council has just 
told schools that children may no longer travel to class by tractor 
trailer. ‘It’s so ridiculous it defies belief,’ he says. Presumably, on 
that basis, all carnival floats are henceforth illegal.

These
 are people who know the ways of these ancient and complex water 
courses. And, in their view, that knowledge has been completely ignored 
by officialdom and yet they are the ones left to suffer the 
consequences.

Little
 wonder the Environment Secretary, Owen Paterson, had such a hostile 
reception when he dropped in earlier this week. It didn’t help that it 
had taken three weeks for him to come and that he failed to visit a 
single flooded home.

Perhaps his greatest sin was to arrive in a pair of black shoes. ‘Where were his Wellington boots?’ asks Julian Temperley.

Vow: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson promised a new plan to deal with flooding in Somerset in six weeks after facing their anger on a visit yesterday

‘He was a man walking into a storm and he does seem to have had a good kicking,’ says Charlie Vaughan-Johnson, the good-humoured, unofficial ‘harbourmaster’ of Muchelney – on the grounds that the ‘ferry terminal’ is next to his garden gate.

None of these people is moaning about flooding per se. It is the needless extent of the problem which upsets them – and the fact that this is the second time this has happened in 14 months.

James Winslade’s family have farmed this patch of the Somerset Levels for 150 years. But now, for the first time, his parents are homeless, driven out by the floods. ‘My father’s 88 with dementia, so it’s very important to keep things familiar. But how can you do that in this?’

For three weeks now, 790 of the family’s 840 acres have been underwater. The last flood cost him £163,000. This one will cost the same again and may even put the farm out of business.

In which case, Winslade Farm will be without Winslades for the first time since Queen Victoria.Still, at least the water voles should be alright.
