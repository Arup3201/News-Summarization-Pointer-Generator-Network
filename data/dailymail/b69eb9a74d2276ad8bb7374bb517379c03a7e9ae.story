This is the moment locals managed to pull a giraffe free after it became stuck in a muddy river at a luxury safari reserve in Northern Kenya.

The rescue effort at Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Laikipia took several hours, but the mature bull placidly allowed conservationists to come to his aid.

The exhausted animal, which had been struggling for some time to extract itself, immediately took a nap after it was pulled to safety, before getting back on its feet.

Exhausted: The mature bull, who had struggled for hours, promptly took a nap after his dramatic ordeal

A dozen staff from both Lewa and the reserve's luxury safari lodge, Sirikoi, rushed to the aid of the bull, who had wandered into the mud while on his way to visit his girlfriend Nditu's, the lodge's resident giraffe.

A Sirikoi staffmember happened upon the distressed animal and sounded the alarm. The conservationists moved the bull onto its side to check its legs were not broken.

They then extracted the animal from the mud by using a sling to drag him onto the bank. His eyes were covered during the process to reduce stress.

Giraffe rescues are a rare occurrence, as the animals are usually very careful and manage to avoid the mud, a spokesperson for the safari told MailOnline Travel.

In comparison buffalo and elephant frequently find themselves in a sticky situation. 

Rose Hipwood, founder of The Luxury Safari Company said: 'Rescues like this are rare, but Lewa and Sirikoi boast some of Africa's most experienced conservationists so the wildlife in these areas (and many other areas of Africa) benefit from the highest level of knowledge when it comes to preserving them.'

Safari in style: The reserve is home to Sirikoi, a luxurious game lodge

Sirikoi, on the slopes of Mount Kenya, is considered one of the most luxurious game lodges in the country.

'Sirikoi has arguably better game viewing than the Masai Mara - it is one of Kenya's most luxurious lodges and the highlight here is the guest and lodge's involvement in the many conservation initiatives based at Lewa,' Hipwood added.
