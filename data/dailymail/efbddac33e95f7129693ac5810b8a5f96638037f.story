After the Christmas binge, the nation routinely looks for ways to lose the weight piled on while stuffing down another mince pie.

It is a peak time for sales of diet foods and gym memberships on the back of New Year resolution pledges to get thin and fit.

However, the guilty desire for a tasty Indian or Chinese filling take-away is often enough to shatter even a will of iron.

Real or fake?: This is the M&S Indian 'fake-away', with chicken tikka curry, which contains just 400 calories

Real deal: A genuine chicken tikka with pilau rice from a takeaway can have up to 1,928 calories in it

Now, Marks & Spencer, which sells more diet meals than any other retailer on the high street, has developed its own ‘Fake-Away’.

Count on Us - Takeaway Indian meal for one:Chicken Tikka Masala & Chicken Jalfrezi, served with Saffron Pilau Rice and a side of Vegetable Curry (400g)   Calories: 384 Fat: 10.8g Saturated fat: 1.6g    Count on Us - Takeaway Chinese Meal for one: Sweet & Sour Chicken, Beef & Black bean, served with Vegetable Chow Mein & Rice with Peas & Egg (400g) Calories: 384.Fat: 6g.Saturated fat: 1.2g

The idea is that these ready meals, which come in at just 400 calories, can replacing the highly calorific and oily restaurant versions.

A restaurant or take-away chicken tikka masala and rice can come in at 1,931 calories, while sweet and sour chicken and chips could add up to 2,468 calories.

The diet Indian and Chinese takeaways, which cost £3.99, are part of the chain’ s successful ‘Count on Us’ range and would fit into the routine of the popular five and two fasting diet.

The takeaway Indian Meal For One includes chicken tikka masala and chicken jalfrezi, served with saffron pilau rice and a side of vegetable curry.

The Chinese Meal For One includes sweet and sour chicken, beef and black bean, served with vegetable chow mein and rice with peas and egg. 

The 5 and 2 diet requires participants to stick to 500 calories on two non-consecutive days - 600 for men - and eat as normal the remaining five.

The internet is alive with stories of 
dramatic weight loss using this technique, which is also claimed to 
boost general health, including lowering cholesterol.

According to a recent survey, 80per cent of people plan to embark on healthy eating plans in the New Year.

The
 same survey found that a take away was the second most popular item 
people would want to still be able to eat on an diet – at 24per cent. 
The number one item people would like to continue eating was chocolate –
 37per cent.

The M&S Count on Us and Simple Fuller Longer ranges have been a huge success for the chain, with spikes in sales every January and February.

‘Count on Us is the perfect range to help people on the 5:2 diet, as it’s easy to eat tasty, low calorie meals. We’re delighted with the impact on sales.’
