Juventus travel to face Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday night knowing that if they do not score, their German opponents can knock them out with a single goal. So the message is clear: they must attack.

Head coach Massimiliano Allegri has spoken out ahead of the game urging his team to show they are far from the side cast as 'boring' that lead Italy's Serie A - and the Italian sport newspapers have reflected the boss' vision.

La Gazzetta dello Sport, Tuttosport and Corriere dello Sport all call for the nation's champions to attack Dortmund, with a forward line including Marco Reus and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang unlikely to be restricted to an extent that they are unable to score the one goal that could send Dortmund through after Juve's 2-1 home win last month.

La Gazzetta dello Sport's: 'Go Juve! The right choice' and Tuttosport's: 'The order of Allegri: Let's attack!'

Corriere dello Sport's front page barks out: 'Juve, take Europe' after Massimiliano Allegri's comments

Tuttosport's message is the most resounding, with their front page specifically calling for Juve to attack at the Signal Iduna Park making it clear that in order to qualify, the Old Lady need goals.

The paper also calls for Argentine winger Roberto Pereyra to be used in a 4-3-1-2 system by Allegri - who it also reports is set to be offered a new contract.

Both Gazzetta and Corriere look to Juventus' talisman, former Manchester City and Manchester United striker, Carlos Tevez.

Gazzetta also want to see Pereyra deployed in a 4-3-1-2 behind Tevez and Alvaro Morata in a game that could be worth £6.5million to Juve.

Meanwhile, Corriere calls for the 'class of Tevez and super defence to tackle Klopp'.

'We go into the game with an advantage,' Allegri said ahead of the game. 'We know the difficulties of the task ahead of us, no doubt about it.

'I don't expect it to end 0-0. We need to score at least once and if we could score two goals it would be great.'

Allegri believes the game in Dortmund will not end 0-0 and that his side will need to find a way to score

The Germans have been improving in recent weeks after a bad first half to the Bundesliga season and have lost none of their last six league games.

They are also unbeaten at home in Europe this season although they have lost all three previous encounters against the Italians in Dortmund.

'We have to be ready for the strengths of Dortmund, their speed, their pressure,' the Italian coach added. 'We have to have a technically perfect game and pounce on their weaknesses.'
