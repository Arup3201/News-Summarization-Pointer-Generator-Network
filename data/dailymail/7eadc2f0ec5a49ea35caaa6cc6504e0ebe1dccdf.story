A zoo in China was forced to close after two lions escaped from their unlocked cages.

Riot police, snipers and zoo workers armed with tranquiliser guns worked to capture the ferocious animals after they escaped at the zoo in Chongqing, south west China.

According to reports, the lion and lioness were given free run of the zoo when a keeper who was cleaning their enclosure forgot to lock the gate.

Panic: Armed police are on guard as one of two escaped lions at Chongqing Zoo in south west China is returned to its enclosure

Carried to safety: A group of men rush the tranquilised animal back to its pen. One of the lions was caught within the hour but another was at large for more than three hours

Captured: A vet tends to one of the captured lions which has been tranquilised so that it can be returned to its enclosure safely

The zoo was completely evacuated following the escape at 8am.

While the lionness was caught within the hour, the male was at large for almost four hours before he was recaptured.

The pair were both unharmed in their capture.

A zoo spokesman said: 'We found the female first and subdued her with a tranquiliser gun but the male took longer to find and bring back.
