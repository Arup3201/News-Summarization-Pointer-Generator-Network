A local New York paper has come under fire for publishing an opinion piece about President Barack Obama that carries the headline 'The N----r in the White House'.

Incredibly, the WestView News - a community paper that serves Manhattan's West Village - ran the contemptuous term in full.

The headline was printed on page 15 in the latest edition of the periodical.

The accompanying piece by James Lincoln Collier criticizes is about the so-called 'anti-black racism of far-right voters' and how 'far-right voters hate Obama because he is black' according to The New York Post.

Unacceptable: WestView News - a community paper that serves Manhattan's West Village - says that running the contemptuous term was to highlight racism

Strangely the piece is written in support of Obama.

However that has not stopped anger erupting over the mere use of the N-word.

'It’s disrespectful in any context to refer to the president of the United States as the N-word,' one local resident, Eugene May, 31, told The Post.

'If you were quoting something or referring to the historic context of the word being used, I can understand the justification.'

'It seems he’s just using it for shock value.'

The editor of WestView News, 86-year-old George Capsis, attempted to explain the reason for running the word

'The editorial staff continues to object to the use of the word,' Capsis wrote to The Post.

'(But) in this article, however, Jim reminded me that The New York Times avoids using the word which convinced me that WestView should.'

Collier wanted to use the word 'to shock' us into accepting that 'there are people who believe and use this outrageous word', Capsis added.

Collier's piece looks at the 'irreducible measure of racism' in the US and how he believes it has been bolstered by 'America's increasing tolerance of far-right opinion'.

As if to offset any offense the headline would attract, as well as showing alot of though had gone into publishing the slur, WestView News ran a story directly underneath Collier's piece by an African-American columnist.

Damage control: The newspaper a story directly underneath the controversial piece by African-American columnist Alvin Hall, who wrote about how the word offends him

That story was titled 'The Headline offends Me'.

The decision to use the headline feels misguided to me,' Alvin Hall wrote.

'I don’t see how its use benefits anyone, but I do feel all too clearly how it deeply offends me.'

Besides jouralism, James Lincoln Collier also writes children's books and is a jazz musician.
