It must be the way he tells them. Prince Charles had Sir Bruce Forsyth and his beauty queen wife Wilnelia in fits of laughter in the royal box at Wimbledon today.

The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall joined the entertainer and his wife, a former Miss World, at Centre Court to watch Roger Federer take on Fabio Fognini.

Also present, but not seated in the royal box, was Carole Middleton, who took her seat among the masses on Centre Court to watch the second round men's singles face off.

Meanwhile, Heather Watson became the first British woman for a decade to reach the third round.

Prior to watching the Centre Court match Charles met former British number one Tim Henman, while Camilla, who arrived slightly earlier, chatted with former finalist Andy Roddick.

But it was in the royal box that the prince looked most at ease, chatting animatedly with veteran entertainer Sir Bruce, 84, and Lady Forsyth, who looked vivacious in a figure-hugging blue dress.

The heir to the throne couldn't help himself from throwing a few admiring glances in the direction of the 54-year-old Puerto Rican, who won Miss World in 1975 - even as his own wife sat on the other side pretending not to notice.

On court, Federer put on a show fit 
for royalty as he raced into the third round of Wimbledon with an 
utterly dominant victory over Italy's Fognini.

The pair bowed to the prince and the 
Duchess of Cornwall in the Royal Box as they arrived on court, but from 
there the Swiss ace hogged the limelight in a 6-1 6-3 6-2 victory.

Mrs Middleton looked thrilled by the 
action on court, with a good vantage point for the action despite being 
seated among the masses.

A supremely confident Federer struck 
the ball extremely well off both forehand and backhand wings. The 
30-year-old ace has lost only nine games in two matches.

His statistics for the third seed were
very impressive, with 35 winners and only eight unforced errors, while 
he hit 13 aces and lost just four points on his first serve.

Federer, who is again looking to equal
Pete Sampras's tally of seven Wimbledon titles, next faces either 
America's Michael Russell or French 29th seed Julien Benneteau.

The Queen visited Wimbledon in 2010, 
but Charles has not been since 1970. His wife visited last year, the 
same year the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attended.

Kate is rumoured to be planning to visit at some point this year, along with her mother and possibly sister Pippa.

Charles and Camilla's visit comes at a successful time for British tennis, with five players through to the tournament's second round.

Camilla arrived first, meeting club chairman Philip Brook. She chatted with Roddick, who was dressed in his tennis whites but threw his cap to one side before the royal meeting.

He said meeting her was a 'lot of fun', adding: 'I got to meet the Queen a couple of years ago and these are things you realise you don't get to do very often, they are once-in-a-lifetime opportunities.

We always forget the magnitude of Wimbledon and who might be watching.'

Camilla also met chief steward Andrew Gairdner, who is retiring this year, before attending a private lunch.

Charles, rumoured to rarely eat lunch, arrived later, meeting former British number one Henman.

Charles also met former Australian tennis champions Frank Sedgman, Judy Dalton, Ashley Cooper and Neale Fraser.

He and Camilla are due to visit Australia and New Zealand later this year as part of the series of royal tours to mark the Diamond Jubilee.

Watson, ranked 103rd in the world, was on Court 2 when she beat Jamie Lee Hampton of the United States 6-1, 6-4.

She won the match's first five games to take control.

In the first round on Monday, Watson, 20, became the first British woman to win a match on Centre Court since 1985.

Now
she's the first woman from the host country to make it to the third 
round at the All England Club since Elena Baltacha in 2002.

Hampton, who is ranked 100th, was playing in the first grass-court tournament of her career.

Andy Murray's victory over Nikolay Davydenko was part of Britain's most successful start since 2006, when seven Britons made it through to the second round.

Five Britons made it through to the second round this year, which could be six if Jamie Baker beats Andy Roddick when their match continues today.

Murray joined James Ward and women Elena Baltacha and Anne Keothavong in the second round.

Baker will continue his match against Roddick after it was suspended while he was a set down.

Other Britons Laura Robson, Johanna Konta and Naomi Broady have all fallen by the wayside, along with Josh Goodall and Oli Golding.

Organisers said 43,917 attended the club yesterday, down 524 on the same day last year. So far 85,738 people have attended the championships.

Bookmakers William Hill said bets on Murray surged after his successful start.

The bookie is offering 10/1 that Murray wins the championship, although he is tipped to exit at the semi-final stage at 15/8.

Spokesman Rupert Adams said: 'Many believe that the first round was Andy Murray's best start to Wimbledon and are starting to believe that this could be his year after all.

'That said, he has his work cut out with a possible meeting against (Rafael) Nadal in the semi-finals.'

Watson was supported in the stands today by brother Adam, sister-in-law Sarah and niece Sophia while her parents Michelle and Ian and niece Lucy watched at home.

She said: 'Words can't really describe how I'm feeling at the moment. I think it will sink in after I have a shower.

'I was a bit nervous but I felt great out there.

'My parents are at home. I'm not sure if they'll come over - they said they will leave me to get on with it.'
