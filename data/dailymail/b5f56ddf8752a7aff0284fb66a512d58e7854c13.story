Mario Balotelli curled in a brilliant free kick from  range in AC Milan's 3-0 pre season friendly win over Mexico's Chivas Guadalajara  on Wednesday.

The controversial Italian placed his dead ball effort into the 'keeper's top corner either side of goals from Mbaye Niang and Giampaolo Pazzini as the Rossoneri ran out comfortable winners on a rough pitch at the NRG Stadium, Texas.

Niang opened the scoring as he escaped two defenders to guide home a  left-footed finish in the 20th minute to give Milan the lead.

Balotelli's goal in the 38th minute doubled their advantage and an unmarked Pazzini buried a Michael Essien cross in the 72nd minute.

Chivas' Fernando Arce had a close-range shot hit the crossbar in the second minute while his chip from distance in the 13th needed a lunging save by goalkeeper Christian Abbiati.

The match was marred by poor field conditions at NRG Stadium. The temporary grass and sand placed on top of the artificial surface made it difficult for both sides and Milan manager Fillippo Inzaghi said: 'neither team wanted to play on the field.'
