CELEBRITY SUFFERER: American socialite Kim Kardashian

A
 ground-breaking tablet that treats psoriasis could mean an end to the 
debilitating pain and embarrassment suffered by thousands of Britons who
 have the disfiguring skin condition. After promising results in 
clinical trials in America, the NHS is now considering the use of 
Apremilast in the UK and doctors have welcomed the move.

'This is a 
huge step forward in  potentially treating a much greater  proportion of
 people suffering from psoriasis,' says Dr Richard Warren, consultant 
dermatologist at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust and The University 
of Manchester.

'Many patients are worried about  the serious side 
effects associated with existing therapies, and trials suggest this is a
 very safe drug that will require minimal monitoring.'

Psoriasis is a
 common condition in which the immune system produces skin cells too 
quickly, leading to a  build-up of scaly pink patches on the elbows, 
knees and hands, though they can appear anywhere on the body.

About 
three per cent of the UK population suffers, affecting up to 1.8 million
 people. One in 100 suffers an extreme form of the condition that may 
require hospitalisation. Celebrity sufferers include socialite Kim 
Kardashian and singer Art Garfunkel.

Psoriasis can appear at any age
 but usually first develops in adults under 40. A third of psoriasis 
sufferers go on to develop tenderness, pain and swelling in the joints 
and connective tissue, a condition known as psoriatic arthritis.

Psoriasis
 varies greatly in severity. While some patients suffer only minor 
irritation, for others it dramatically reduces quality of life. 
Depression and low self-esteem are common and psoriasis on the hands or 
feet can make many everyday tasks difficult, while psoriatic arthritis 
can cause disability.

First-line treatment is usually moisturisers, 
shampoos and coal-tar preparations while more intense therapies include 
steroid drugs, which can have wide-ranging and unpleasant side effects 
if used long-term.

Ultra-violet light - similar to a sunbed - has 
proved effective in a  percentage of patients, though the benefits last 
only about six weeks before another course  is needed.

Current 
treatments for psoriatic arthritis involve injectable drugs that inhibit
 tumour necrosis factor (TNF), the substance that triggers the 
inflammation  to occur, but carry serious side effects such as nausea, 
infections and liver problems.

The new treatment works by inhibiting
 phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), an enzyme in immune system cells, causing 
an anti-inflammatory effect.

Clinical trials of 1,500 adults with 
active psoriatic arthritis by US drugs company Celgene have shown 
Apremilast to be safe and effective, significantly reducing inflammation
 and joint pain and swelling compared to a placebo.

Few patients (up to two per cent) showed adverse reactions - such as diarrhoea, nausea, weight loss and headache.

Studies
 on psoriasis patients have found that a third experienced a 75 per cent
 improvement in skin problems. Kristian Reich of the SCIderm Research 
Institute and Dermatologikum in Hamburg, who carried out the study, said
 of the drug: 'I see this as a prime candidate for future management of 
psoriasis that allows us to treat a range of patients, including more 
moderate cases earlier on.'

First marketed as Otezla, it was approved
 in March for use in America and it is hoped the drug will become 
available in Europe later this year.

The National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is appraising its use for psoriatic 
arthritis, with hopes  that it will eventually also be available for 
general psoriasis.

One patient keen to try the drug is Robert Hoyle,
 53, an ex-serviceman from Bradford who now works in a warehouse and 
fears his condition will progress into psoriatic arthritis. He suffered 
minor symptoms in his late 30s but dismissed them as sweat rashes for 
years, until psoriasis was eventually diagnosed.

His current 
treatment is Diprosalic, a thick Vaseline-like substance which he finds 
doesn't  rub in easily and has never fully cleared up his skin.

'If 
the new drug is as effective as other treatments I've tried  but without
 the side effects, I'd happily try it, as would many others I know,' 
says Robert, who has had to take several months off work over the past 
seven years due to the condition.

'The ointments can be messy, 
uncomfortable, and time-consuming. A pill that gives relief from the 
scaly skin and constant itching would transform my life.'
