Italian league champion Juventus staged a strong second half rally to win 3-2 over A-League All Stars, led by Alessandro Del Piero, in a pre-season friendly Sunday at Sydney's Olympic stadium.

Fernando Llorente, Paul Pogba and Simone Pepe scored second half goals as the 'Old Lady' came from behind twice against an A-League team which had goals from Marcelo Carrusca and Tomi Juric.

Juventus started with a near full-strength line up, including Italian internationals Gianluigi Buffon and Andrea Pirlo, Argentine Carlos Tevez, and France stars Patrice Evra and Pogba, but the visitors struggled to break through until late in the second half.

Del Piero, who is currently without a contract for the 2014-15 season after two years at Sydney FC, was substituted after 63 minutes to warm embraces from former Juventus team mates.
