Uwe Rosler is sporting blue lips, courtesy of an ice cream he has just  consumed in what appears to be a rather desperate effort to remain awake.

Two coffees and a water have already been demolished, with Wigan Athletic’s manager admitting he did not sleep well after seeing his side lose to Millwall at home the previous evening.

‘I watched it again,’ he says. ‘I was  frustrated because we didn’t perform like we should. Before I knew, it’s 4am. Then 6am. I must have had two hours’ sleep.’

Up for the Cup! Uwe Rosler is hoping to upset Arsenal in the FA Cup semi-final showdown at Wembley

Rosler believes in such detailed analysis. He says he studied last season’s FA Cup final before Wigan met Manchester City in this season’s quarter-final, publicly acknowledging predecessor Roberto Martinez’s contribution in demonstrating how to conquer their super-rich opponents.

And this week Rosler was thanking  Martinez again, this time for providing a few pointers in how to beat Arsenal. Having watched Martinez’s Everton thrash Arsenal 3-0 last weekend, Rosler has taken what he can into his preparation for today’s semi-final at Wembley.

Martinez has been hugely supportive, says Rosler.

‘I like Roberto,’ he says. ‘We had dinner soon after I came here. He is a very friendly, very helpful man. I like to soak up as much information as I can and he is one of the top managers. I’ve studied him very much, wasn’t surprised he found a tactic to cause Arsene Wenger problems. I was very impressed with how good Everton were at the beginning of the game without the ball — to break the rhythm, to deny them space, to counter-attack quickly.

‘I was also impressed by how  disciplined they were. They got their rewards. It was good for a young manager to see.’

Rosler is not offended by comparisons with Martinez. He modestly suggests he would be happy to be only half as successful as the Spaniard. But the 45-year-old  German has his own values and beliefs. He is his own man; the  product of a very different system to the one that nurtured Martinez.

In his recent autobiography he writes at length about his upbringing in the former East Germany. In these pages he told how the Stasi, the East German secret police, tried to recruit him. But it is interesting to hear how much he feels he owes to the government-funded  education he received.

He was just 11 years old when he moved from the family home in Altenburg to an elite sports school in Leipzig. But, like many boarding- school pupils everywhere, he insists it was the making of them.‘It made me the person I am,’ he says. ‘To survive an elite sports school like that — it provided intense competition from a very young age and I am driven by competition.’

Head to head: Rosler's Wigan will be overwhelming underdogs against Arsene Wenger's Arsenal at Wembley

As we chat in a Wigan restaurant, Rosler recalls stories that would horrify most of us. As well as those attempts to recruit him, he says he suspects team-mates, friends, even members of his extended family were already working as Stasi informants to keep tabs on him.

‘You knew people were looking at you, and after you, too,’ he says. ‘You were aware you were being watched, even if you were never sure who it was watching you. You could guess. It could be friends, family members at times, definitely my team-mates — informants. You knew you needed to be careful about what you said.

‘But when the government has invested time and money in you, they want to make sure you are not looking to leave the country. It would have been a defeat for the philosophy of the government to have something like that happen.’

Against all odds: Wigan pulled off a major upset by defeating Manchester City in last season's FA Cup final

Rosler’s defence of the system — for instance, he insists all those Olympic and world medals were ‘not just down to doping’ — reveals an admiration for discipline and hard work. Not to mention a scouting system he says was employed by German football in 2000 when they revolutionised their youth programme.

‘A lot of those principles came from East Germany,’ he says, while insisting he had no experience of doping in his sport.

Catch Arsenal on the breakWigans's tactics of soaking up pressure and breaking in numbers worked against Manchester City in last year’s final. Expect more of the same from Uwe Rosler’s team.

Exploit wide open spacesWingers Shaun Maloney and Callum McManaman were key figures in last season's Wembley upset and are fit after injury. Rosler could have two aces up his sleeve.

Rough them up a littleWigan are a more physical side under Rosler. The likes of Boyce, McArthur and Barnet unsettled City in the last round and Arsenal could be more susceptible.

He nevertheless feels fortunate because the fall of the Berlin Wall enabled him to head west and make a good living — and help him enjoy an enduring love affair with City.

‘I consider myself very lucky to have lived 20 years in one system and now more than 20 years in another,’ Rosler continues. ‘It makes me more rounded. My DNA is still made from that time. Also from my parents: normal working- class people.

‘Some I knew in East Germany were not so lucky. Coming to the end of their careers, they were born at the wrong time.’

This is the kind of consideration a 45-year-old Rosler likes to show his players today.

‘I am a communicator,’ he says. ‘I communicate with players all the time. I want to know how they feel. I want to know how their private life is. I want to know so I treat them in the best possible way.’

Early education: As a player, Rosler was schooled in Germany before coming to Man City in 1994

There is a sense of perspective here. Something that comes, he says, from his experience of serious illness. More specifically his battle with non-Hodgkin lymphoma 11 years ago.

‘It has definitely given me a greater sense of perspective,’ he says, ‘because you never know what is around the corner.

‘I was 34 and they said I would not make it through Easter. I was protected from that at the time. My wife (Cecilie) was told but she did not tell me at the time. She’s a very strong person.

‘It has made me appreciate more the family time. In my job there is not much family time but mine supported me through everything. I am ambitious. I want to be the best I can be but my family, my children, they are important too.’

Keeping his family happy was a factor in his decision to move from Brentford to Wigan last December. Ambition was also an element but taking his family back to Cheshire was a further incentive. So was the opportunity to work for Dave Whelan.

‘I liked what he and the club 
represented,’ says Rosler. ‘Stable ownership, stable finances, a short 
line of communication. And I could be with my family in Manchester.

‘Before
 I went to Brentford there were four interviews. With the owner here I 
went to his house. We talked. Not just about football but about life, 
and after 45 minutes he said the job was mine. “Just don’t be greedy,” 
he then told me.’

Whatever Whelan is paying Rosler, he must consider it money well spent. The German has not just restored stability after Owen Coyle’s troubled tenure. He has guided them into a play-off position, six points clear of seventh-placed Brighton with five games left, and he has followed Martinez in masterminding another astonishing FA Cup run.

It is also worth noting that the Brentford side he left is within touching distance of automatic promotion from League One.

‘My philosophy is to work with young players, English players,’ he says. ‘The talent is here. The players are well educated but they don’t always get the opportunity. I try to identify those players. It worked at Brentford and it is working at Wigan.’

Not again! Rosler does not want a repeat of his Wembley loss with Brentford in last season's play-off final

Mention of Brentford does, of course, bring him back to Wembley and the 2-1 defeat by Yeovil in last year’s play-off final. ‘That was not a good memory,’ he says.

‘After all that happened, after the way we missed out on automatic promotion by losing to Doncaster on the last day, I needed a holiday to overcome it. The first three days I was just sleeping.’

He would hope to sleep better after tomorrow.
