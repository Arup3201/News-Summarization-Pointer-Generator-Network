Disappeared: Tom Billings, 22, went missing during a 'couch-surfing' trip around North America

A family has described their heartbreak at spending Christmas without their son who went missing a month ago in Canada.

Tom Billings, 22, disappeared while he was 'couch-surfing' in North America and is father fears he could be dead.

He walked out of a house in Vancouver, leaving his mobile phone, ruck sack and nearly all of his other possessions behind.

The psychology graduate is said to have gone hiking around North Shore, which is renowned for its dangerous territory.

He was sleeping in 
stranger's homes for free, while he visited New York, Washington, State, 
California and Texas before reaching Canada.

His family said he would normally decorate the tree for them when he returned from his studies at Durham University.

His father, Martin, told The Times said Tom had had already been missing a week when the police were informed.

'They believe Tom might have begun hiking somewhere quite suburban and after a couple of hours arrived in difficult alpine territory, almost without realising, and got into trouble', he added.

'If Tom is out in the mountains somewhere I do not think there is any realistic possibility he has survived.'

Police have analysed Tom's laptop and have found he was looking at hiking trails in the area.

Search and rescue helicopters have been searching the area, but their only lead is a possible sighting of him in a cafe on November 23.

Tom left the UK for his trip last October and stayed in touch with his father and mother, Laura, every week.

He was due to start work as a research assistant in Delhi in January before doing a masters or PHD next September.  

Promising: Mr Billings graduated last year after he studied psychology at Durham University
