In January more than 200 people sent Esa video selfies for their ‘Rosetta Wake Up’ campaign.

This was an international video shout-out to celebrate the end of 31 months of deep-space hibernation for Esa’s Rosetta spacecraft, currently on its way to a comet.

And now Esa plans to send some of the messages into space on a trip out of the solar system.

Scroll down for a video compliation of the selfies

Esa is sending 10 video selfies into deep space via a transmission from a tracking station in Spain. This will include the entry from Ellinogermankiki Agogi Primary School in Greece, pictured, which won the 'Rosetta Wake Up' competition with 10,508 votes

The endeavour will be carried out by Cerebos, Esa’s 115ft (35 metres) deep-space tracking station at Cebreros, Spain.

The station will transmit a 35-megabyte archive filed with the top 10 video selfies that were were submitted to Esa during the Rosetta Wake Up campaign. 

The message will be broadcast into deep space on 15 May 2015.

Cerberos is part of Esa’s Estrack network that is used to send and receive data from spacecraft including Mars Express, Venus Express, Rosetta and Gaia, the latter of which is currently compiling a 3D catalogue of one billion objects in the Milky Way.

On their website Esa says it’s difficult to know how far the signal will go, ‘given the low-ish transmit power and the probability of being attenuated to undetectable levels in the future.’

Travelling at light speed, the signal will pass the moon’s orbit in one second.

After four hours it will be beyond Neptune, and 10 months later it will pass through the Oort cloud of comets that surround the sun.

In 20,000 years it will leave the Milky Way and, ultimately, in 13.8 billion years it will reach the edge of the observable universe that we can see from Earth today.

Cebreros station (DSA 2), from where the transmission will be made, was inaugurated in 2005 and is the second in Esa's 115-foot (35 metres) trio of deep space stations; the other two are in New Norcia, Australia (DSA 1), and Malargüe, Argentina (DSA 3)

The videos were part of a competition celebrating the end of the Rosetta spacecraft's 31-month hibernation on its way to study comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (artist's illustration shown). The spaececraft will enter orbit around the comet this month and will drop a lander, Philae, onto the surface later this year

To make the transmission, the station will point directly upwards in what the engineers call the ‘Stow’ position.

While the station is capable of transmitting at 20 kilowatts, it will use a two kilowatt amplifier in this case.

The transmission will start at about 13:40 UK time and will last about three minutes.

The bit rate, the speed at which data is transferred, will be about 250 kilobits per second.

Although significantly slower than a home internet connection (which is about 5,000 to 10,000 kilobits per second), it is much faster than spacecraft transmission.

For example, transmission to Rosetta is two kilobits per second, while Gaia is four kilobits per second.

Esa has invited a group of students from Colegio Público (Peñaluenga) De El Castillo De Las Guardas near Seville to help with the event.

The Cerberos station is situated near Madrid, Spain. It is one of the world's most sophisticated and technically advanced tracking stations used for satellite control, and is capable of communicating with missions orbiting as far away as Jupiter
