A trove of sunken treasure from the has been unearthed thanks to a drought that reduced a Polish river to puddles.

More than ten tons of ornate marble statues, fountains and palace pillars appeared on the bed of Poland's River Vistula as its waters gradually receded to record lows over the summer.

The haul is believed to have been left behind by marauding Swedish invaders who plundered Poland's rulers in the 17th Century loading the spoils onto barges to transport home.

But experts believe the masonry proved too heavy for their wooden warships which eventually sank under the weight.

Artefacts: Historians salvage 17th century 
marble and alabaster decorative structures in the bed of the Vistula 
River in Warsaw, Poland, after its waters ebbed to record low levels

Century, loading the spoils onto barges to transport home

And while the ships were long-since swept away their cargo remained, 
entombed in mud at the bottom of the river for more than 400 years.

The period is known in Poland as The Deluge, when the Scandinavian hordes launched the Second Northern War in 1655.

While they had one of Europe's most powerful armies, Swedish warlords 
had little with which to pay their troops so they swept through eastern 
Europe pillaging everything in their way.

The armies plundered vast quantities of Poland's riches - most of which were never returned.

Warsaw was so badly ravaged that its pre-war population of 20,000 was reduced to 2,000 by the time the Swedes set sail for home.

They even appeared to break up the stonework, large blocks of carved marble which were used in 
the columns, fountains, and staircases of Polish palaces, into manageable pieces which historians believe they planned to reassemble in their homeland.

Lost: The stonework has lain at the bottom of the Vistula since the boats carrying it sank before reaching the Baltic

Revealing: Historians say the find is the best material evidence they have so far to recreate the events of the war nearly 500 years ago

Relics: The artefacts now lie exposed apart from a coating of foul-smelling yellow mud

The drought also revealed other fragments of Polish history, including unexploded mines from the  Second World War and pieces of Jewish gravestones - the legacy of successive Nazi and Soviet schemes to wipe out all traces of the Warsaw's Jewish community.

Researchers knew about the artefacts, but, 
before the drought, retrieving them was a painstaking task because they 
were under several feet of water.

Now
 though, they are lying 
exposed apart from a coating of foul-smelling yellow mud.

statues, fountains and palace pillars appeared on the bed of Poland's 
River Vistula as its waters gradually receded to record lows over the 
summer

'The
 drought helped us a lot because what had been lying underneath is now 
at the surface,' said Hubert Kowalski, deputy director of the University
 of Warsaw Museum, who is leading the effort to retrieve the marble stonework.

Speaking
 at a building owned by the Warsaw river police, where some of the 
stonework is being temporarily stored, he said historians' knowledge 
about what happened four centuries ago had previously been sketchy.

'Now we have evidence, the best material evidence of the Swedish invasion so far,' Mr Kowalski said.

He said the gravestones, or matzevah,  would be handed over to the city's 
Jewish Historical Institute. Finds of Jewish artefacts are quite common 
in Warsaw.

Spoils of war: The haul is believed to have been
 left behind in the river at capital Warsaw by marauding Swedish 
invaders who plundered Polish rulers in the 17th Century

Historians
 believed that the Swedes who invaded Poland in the 17th century planned
 to move the looted cargo up the Vistula to Gdansk, where the river 
joins the Baltic Sea, and from there transport it home.

There is still no firm explanation of why the boats sank on the way.

Mr Kowalski said he and his team had so far located up to 10 tonnes of stonework, but this was only the beginning.

'The boats had a capacity of 50-60 tonnes (each), so we think that we should find much more,' he said.

 shows Swedish king Charles X Gustav in skirmish with Polish Tartars at 
the battle of Warsaw. Swedish armies plundered vast quantities of 
Poland's riches during their invasion that began in 1655

Once it has been removed from the river bed and catalogued, the plan is to take the masonry to Warsaw's Royal Castle, one of the sites from which, historians believe, it was looted by the Swedish invaders.

For now though, the low water levels that revealed the artefacts are hampering efforts to retrieve them. Regular lifting equipment would sink into the mud, but the river is too low for the researchers to bring in floating cranes.

'We need to wait until it gets higher,' Kowalski said.
