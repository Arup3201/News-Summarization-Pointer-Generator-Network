A woman who lived in the same house as the three people accused of torturing, murdering and dismembering a Marine wife testified yesterday about the bizarre relationship between the trio - including who was the 'master' and who controlled the house.

The unidentified woman said that defendant Dorothy Maraglino, also known as 'Dee', owned the San Diego house and was responsible for most of the decision making, even though Louis Perez was her 'sex master'.

The two defendants and Jessica Lopez, who all lived at the house, are accused of the kidnap and murder of Brittany Killgore, 22, wife of a Camp Pendleton Marine.

Tricked: Brittany Killgore, 22, never wanted to participate in the bizarre sex games that she was subjected to before her murder, prosecutors say

Defendant: Dorothy Maraglino, also known as 'Dee', owned the San Diego house and was responsible for most of the decision making, even though Louis Perez was her 'sex master'

Contract of terms: Maraglino ran the household when Louis Perez - who was only there sporadically - was away

Defendant: Jessica Lopez is also accused of the kidnap and murder of Brittany Killgore, 22, wife of a Camp Pendleton Marine

All three are believed to have participated in an alternative lifestyle that included bondage and sadomasochism.

They engaged in those activities in 
the house, prosecutors have said, the same house where Killgore is 
believed to have been killed.

'I believe that Dee did most of the 
controlling in the house,' the witness testified on the second day of a 
preliminary hearing, and added that there was a 'contract' that laid out
the rules of their relationship.

Maraglino ran the household when Perez - who was only there sporadically - was away.

'It’s her house so she would make the rules in his absence,' the woman said.

Prosecutors and investigators have 
said that Killgore was not involved in the alternative lifestyle 
described in court, according to UT San Diego.

The three have pleaded not guilty to 
killing Killgore, who vanished last year 
while her estranged husband was serving in Afghanistan.

They also are charged with conspiracy, kidnapping and torture.

Alternate lifestyle: Prosecutors say Louis Ray Perez led a bondage sex ring and was active in playing out violent sex fantasies with his two lovers

Prosecutors contend that Killgore met
the trio when she and a friend went to a home in Fallbrook, north of 
San Diego, to buy an item being sold online, according to the North 
County Times.

Killgore
turned down Perez's offer. However, later in the day, she sent him a 
text message asking if she knew anyone who could help her move.

'Party with me tonight & you’ll have five guys there in the morning,' he replied.

Killgore was last seen April 13 in a 
borrowed purple evening gown, three days after she filed for divorce 
from Lance Cpl Cory Killgore. Authorities have cleared him of any 
involvement in her death.

Authorities contend that Killgore was
kidnapped and made an unwilling participant in bondage and torture 
before she was strangled and her nude body left in a ditch near Lake 
Skinner in Riverside County.

San Diego County sheriff's detectives
said they found 'bondage-type sex apparatuses, toys and tools' in the 
Fallbrook home where the trio lived.

Newly unsealed documents listed numerous bondage objects seized as evidence from the house of Louis Perez, Dorothy Maraglino and  Jessica Lynn Lopez.

A partial list follows:

Unsealed Court documents previously revealed that police seized whips, sex toys, rope and pulleys, a document 
titled 'Slave Rules', duct tape, a stun baton and other bondage 
instruments from the house.

Investigators 
found Killgore's blood and hair on several of the items.

Investigators said they believe all 
three were with Killgore at the home shortly after she apparently sent a
desperate text message to a friend that simply said: 'Help'.

In an affidavit filed in court last year, a detective said the trio may have targeted Killgore for 'unusual sexual fetishes'.

Perez was arrested on April 15 on suspicion of possessing a stolen assault rifle and was later charged with murder.

Lopez was arrested on April 17 at a San Diego hotel where she was discovered with self-inflicted cuts.

They also found a letter in which 
Lopez allegedly claimed that she killed Killgore out of fear that the 
woman would steal away Perez, whom she described as her 'master'.

Lopez said she tried to chop up 
Killgore's body with power tools before dumping it near the lake, but 
the body was found hours later.

The letter also contended that Perez 
and Maraglino weren't responsible for the killing. However, prosecutors 
said both were involved.
