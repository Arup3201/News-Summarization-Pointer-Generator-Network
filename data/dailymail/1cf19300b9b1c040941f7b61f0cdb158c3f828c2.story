In 2006, 12-year-old In 2006 Hugo Cornellier saw a video comprising hundreds of self-portraits and was so inspired he began taking selfies and has become obsessed about taking one every day.saw a video of self-portraits that photographer Noah Kalina had uploaded to YouTube – and decided to copy the idea.

From that day, Mr Cornellier has taken a selfie and now the resulting almost 3,000 photographs form the basis of a new video he has posted,

Three years ago, five years into his project he posted the video on social news site Reddit’s r/IAmA section.

Scroll down for video 

From first to last:  Hugo Cornellier began taking selfies when he was 12 (left) and is still taking them daily. He has compiled all the nearly 3,000 shots into a video and the last image taken when he was 19 is above right

The one-minute video was so popular it appeared on the section’s front page until it was taken down without explanation by moderators.

At the time, Mr Cornellier said that although he had missed a day or two, he was obsessed by selfies: ‘I would take my laptop everywhere my family went. Whether it was a holiday or to visit family for a few days, I always had to take my photo every single day, no matter what.

Hair tpday, gone tomorrow: Hugo Cornellier has missed only a couple of days of taking selfies

The eyes have it: In none of the selfies does Mr Cornellier crack a smile

That was three years ago and Mr Cornellier shows no sign of flagging as the new video lasting 1 minute 34 seconds shows. 

'It all started because my dad bought a time-lapse camera. I'd seen similar videos but I realized no one had done it to document their teenage years. And I thought, "I want to create one,"' he told the MailOnline.

'I knew I was going to change a lot physically in the next few years.' 

Cornellier was right - in the video, he goes from a smooth-cheeked pre-teen to a young man, complete with beard and requisite hair experimentation.

It's riveting to watch, and for Cornellier, the video hasn't lost any of its fascination.

'Even single time I look at it it remind it's amazing. It still has an effect on me,' he said.

Even more amazing is that Cornellier didn't lose interest in the project in a bout of teen apathy.

'I took the first 50 pictures and made a time-lapse video with them, and it was so cool. I didn't want to stop after that,' he told MailOnline.

It became a habit for Cornellier, and he made sure to keep it up even while traveling in Cuba or holidaying in New Brunswick, using whatever method possible, including his mom's iPad.

Over seven years - roughly 2,500 days - he estimates he's only missed about 50 days.

'Every time I would miss a day, I would feel bad. I would go on holiday and I'd take a camera. No matter where I went, I really just had to do my photo.'

Hairy look: Having experimented with an elaborate goatee, Mr Cornellier goes the whole hog with a full beard

Mr Cornellier takes his selfies on his laptop and at times multi-tasks listening to his sounds (right)

Occasionally Mr Cornellier ventured outside to take his selfies (left) and once in a while went for a new hairstyle and matched it with a beard but eschewed a moustache

 When he first began to post his videos, he called the project 'Picture Everyday.'

But with the rise of the selfie, Cornellier thought he'd capture the zeitgeist and changed it to 'Selfie Everyday,' which he says has made his traffic rise exponentially. 

'Changing it helped,' he said of the name. 'The trend has definitely helped my video.'

But even Cornellier is amazed by the response to his latest cut.

'I never expected it, it's gone crazy. Every two minutes there's a comment,' he said.

The video has received hundreds of comments from its viewers. So far it has been seen by almost one and a half million people and the reaction has, it is fair to say, been mixed.

While a viewer compliments Hugo Cornellier's looks, another compares watching the video to taking drugs

Another viewer thought that while Richard Linklater's 2014 film Boyhood - shot over a 12-year period - was not very good, she liked Hugo Cornellier's effort while Colin McGarry does not care for the video but cares enough to post a comment about it

And while seven years is a long time to commit to a project, Cornellier has no plans to stop.

'I'm absolutely going to keep going. I'm never going to stop. I'm going to keep doing it forever,' he told MailOnline. 'I'm going to do it until I get old. The video will be me from 12 until literally wrinkles on my face. Thinking about that is what makes me keep going.

'My entire life in three minutes. That's what inspires me to keep doing it.'
