A gargantuan facility that covers some 330 acres, this is where England's football bosses will coach future generations of sporting heroes.

Based just outside Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, St George's Park Football Centre has 12 pitches, a dedicated practice and training area for goalkeepers, and sports pavilions for post-training de-briefs.

But that is far from the whole story. Among other facilities at the £105million complex are state-of-the-art hydrotherapy suites, biomechanic gyms and video analysis amenities.

And it also comes with an altitude chamber to mimic a variety of playing conditions and two hotels with suites named after legendary England players and coaches.

Formally opened by the Duke and 
Duchess of Cambridge yesterday, it is hoped that St George's Park - 
where coaches will be coached - will improve the quality of football 
leaders in the dugout and in turn boost the performance of players on 
the pitch, both for their clubs and the national side.

All of England's 24 national teams 
will use the site as their training base ahead of international fixtures
and, yesterday, the country's top football stars were put through their
paces at the centre for the first time.

Long term investment of a similar 
nature by France and Spain at their respective bases in Clairefontaine 
and Madrid was key to their recent World Cup and European Championship 
success.

Prince William and his wife Kate were yesterday given a 
tour of the main facilities at St George's Park before meeting England manager Roy Hodgson 
and his squad as they trained there for the first time ahead of 
their World Cup qualifier on Friday.

In a speech after being shown round the centre, William said:
'‬Coming here this morning, seeing these wonderful facilities and 
beautiful surroundings – just experiencing this extraordinary place - 
gave me the same feelings I had when I first went to the Olympic Park.

'A
mixture of pride that we are capable in this country of creating 
something so beyond compare anywhere else, and excitement at what this 
means, not just for our national game, but for sport and opportunity in 
this country as a whole.‬‪

'St
George’s Park, and the concept that underpins it, is something totally 
new. It will be far more than just a world class facility for training 
our future world-beating national team.

'It is more than just the university 
from which thousands of highly qualified coaches will graduate. It is 
also a magnificent example of the sort of social initiative that brings 
opportunity and purpose to wider British life.

'It will provide employment and a 
social hub for local people and, through the thousands of volunteers on 
which coaching relies, it will foster community spirit, purpose and hope
throughout England.

'The superb medical and 
rehabilitation facilities that St George’s Park possesses, offer us the 
clearest example of how this incredible place will help those way beyond
the frontiers of football.

'Ex-servicemen and women, some of 
whom will have been wounded in the service of our country, will find 
respite and care here – and for that we must all be grateful to the 
innovative minds that created St. George’s Park.'

After their tour of the facilities, 
William and Kate stepped onto one of the centre's grass pitches - the 
exact size of the one at Wembley. There they met with members of the 
England squad who had been training with manager Roy Hodgson.

The royal couple posed for a 'team' photograph then set about chatting to the players.

William made a beeline for Wayne 
Rooney and Ashley Cole. As he shook Cole's hand he appeared to rib the 
player about his current 'difficulties' with the FA, of which he is 
president.

Cole visibly blushed, laughed and stared at his feet as the pair jested.

Sources said later that the prince 
had told Cole, who has been charged with bringing the FA into disrepute 
after calling them 'a bunch of t***s' on Twitter: 'If you continue to be
a naughty boy then they will take your Twitter account off you!'

The exchange was said to be 'incredibly light-hearted' despite William's position.

Kate, meanwhile, chatted at length to Frank Lampard, Adam Johnson and captain Steven Gerrard.

During their visit, William and Kate 
toured the centre's state-of-the-art fitness and rehabilitation 
facilities, which include an exercise chamber replicating high altitude 
conditions.

As well as chatting with staff and 
those working out on exercise bikes and running machines, the Duke and 
Duchess were invited to test out a push-button 'board' to gauge their 
reactions - with William beating his wife in the 30-second match-up by 
31 points to 28.

After inspecting an anti-gravity 
treadmill and hi-tech exercise bikes designed by British Cycling, the 
royal couple were shown around a hydrotherapy pool.
