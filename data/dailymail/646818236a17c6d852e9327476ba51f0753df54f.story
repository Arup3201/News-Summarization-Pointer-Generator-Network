As Britain braces itself for  downpours this winter, one council has come up with an ingenious solution to reducing the risk to homes from flooding - building them on stilts.

Houses in a Suffolk town are to be built on poles measuring three metres high, in a Dutch-inspired scheme to keep them safe away from flood waters.

It is thought to be the first time the scheme will be used in the UK.

The homes, which are part of a £150 million housing scheme, were designed by London firm Assael Architecture for the Suffolk peninsula, where flooding is a particular concern. 

Polly Damen, 45, director of Assael, said: 'We designed these innovative houses on stilts so they could survive in an obvious flood zone.

'The whole scheme was inspired by Dutch solution to flooding - I don't think this has been tried yet in England.'

The scheme at Lake Lothing in Lowestoft was given planning approval by Waveney District Council last week. 

The homes are to be built on stilts on the flood plain and are inspired by a Dutch design to cope with flooding 

The scheme will be built around Lake Lothing in Suffolk to avoid houses on the flood plain being flooded 

Mrs Damen said the designs had been welcomed by the council and public and they were keen to seem more similar homes built in the area. 

'They're essentially flat-pack buildings which can be put up quickly and can cope with any kind of flood - they can be raised as high as you'd like quite easily,' she added. 

Experts predict the sea level in Suffolk will rise 37cm by the year 2080, making coastal flooding more likely.

Earlier this year vast areas of the Somerset Levels were left underwater by torrential rain and floods 

In February cars  were left floating in flood waters near  Somerset during the wettest ever winter for the UK 

Council planners will be hoping to avoid what happened in Somerset last winter when vast swathes of the south west were left submerged when the country was battered by torrential rain. 

Villages in the Somerset Levels were completely cut off by the flood waters, and the Environment Agency was forced to bring in dredgers and pumps to remove some of the excess water.

The Met Office said last winter was the wettest on record. 

Two weeks' worth of rainfall are expected to hit the UK on Tuesday night as Hurricane Gonzalo hits the country.
