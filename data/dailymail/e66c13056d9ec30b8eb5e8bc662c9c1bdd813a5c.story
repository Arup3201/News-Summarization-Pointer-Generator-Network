Scarred: Wayne Ingold was attacked when he answered the door at his home in Witham, Essex

A father of two scarred for life in a horrific mistaken identity acid attack has bravely released pictures of his 'appalling injuries' in a bid to track down the men responsible.

Wayne Ingold opened a communal door at his block of flats in Witham, Essex when he heard a man banging.

But the 56-year-old's life was forever changed in that fateful moment when he opened the door as a second men squirted his face and upper body with acid.

The retired chauffeur - who had worked for pop supremo Simon Cowell - rushed back inside his home screaming in pain looking in his mirror to see his face 'melting'. 

Mr Ingold has now bravely allowed pictures of his injuries, taken whilst he was in hospital, to be released in the hope it will lead to arrests.

Describing the horror attack, he said: 'I thought to myself, naively, why is this man squirting juice in my face?

'I put my hand up to protect myself, the guy carried on spraying it down my back, neck and shoulder.

'I took some of it in the mouth and swallowed it, it turned my face and some of my teeth black.

'Within seconds, the pain was unbelievable. I put my hands up to my face, turned and ran back into the flat.

'I looked into the mirror in the bathroom and it looked like my face was melting.'

Mr Ingold was rushed from his home to a specialist burns unit at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford.

He has undergone a series of skin grafts since the attack but doctors have warned him that he will be scarred for life.

Horrific injuries: Mr Ingold has asked for the graphic pictures to be released in the hope that those responsible will be caught and brought to justice

Mr Ingold, who has also worked as a wedding photographer, has moved out of his home because of the emotional impact the acid attack had on him.

He remains mystified as to why he was attacked but believes it was a case of mistaken identity, simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

He said one of his two attackers shouted '55' as he opened the door, but that was not the number of his ground-floor flat.

Mr Ingold has undergone weeks of painful skin grafts following the attack last month to repair the damage done.

He believes it was only the quick thinking of paramedics that saved him.

'I managed to get to the phone and call 999. I was just screaming down the phone for them to come quick. It felt like it took 10 hours for them to come, but it was more like 10 minutes.

'If it wasn't for the paramedics' quick thinking it could have been a lot worse - they rushed me into the shower and washed me down for ages - I'd really like to thank them.'

'After the skin grafts, my legs looked like raw steaks, but the doctors are happy with the way the grafts have taken and have to moisturise my skin daily.

Police have released e-fits of the two men they want to speak to in connection with the chemical attack

The horrific incident was particularly tough on Mr Ingold, who had to sell his photography business after suffering a stroke and brain haemorrhage in 2006 and had to learn to walk and talk again.

He is hoping that his attackers will see the impact of what they have done and give themselves up to police.

He said: 'Until a few weeks ago my face was still black. I just want to know what gives them the right to do this to an innocent person, to destroy my life and my son's and daughter's; we've all been through hell.

'I still feel terrible - my confidence is on the floor, I still get flashbacks of a guy throwing the acid on me then running around the corner.

'I just want them caught and brought to justice. If they can do it to me they can do it to someone else.'

DC Alan Lewis from Essex Police said: 'The photographs clearly show how Wayne suffered appalling injuries in this incident.

'He has asked us to release them to show what these people are capable of causing and how they have to be taken off the streets and brought to justice.

'It is believed that this was a case of mistaken identity and extensive investigations have shown that there is no evidence that anyone in the area was the intended victim in this crime.

'We have now widened our enquires in to the London area but we are still hoping that people in Witham may remember seeing the two men in the e-fits.

'We also hope that someone might remember seeing the two men up to half an hour before the incident occurred. We believe that they seemed to be lost and were wandering around looking at property numbers before arriving at the flats.

'We know they had a blue Vauxhall Signum or hatchback-style vehicle that was seen in the area but we have no information about the index number or anything else that would help us find it.'

Anyone who recognises the men in either e-fit or who has other information about the attack is asked to call Essex Police at Braintree CID on 101 or ring Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

A 19-year-old man was arrested following the attack but released on bail the next day as the investigation continues.
