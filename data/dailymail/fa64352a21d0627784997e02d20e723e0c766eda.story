Wolfsburg are stepping up their ambitious pursuit of Chelsea striker Andre Schurrle with a £23million move.

The Bundesliga side have identified the Germany international as a player who can help them guarantee qualification for Champions League football and they want to sign him ahead of interest from struggling Borussia Dortmund.

However, Chelsea value him at a whopping £30m.

The World Cup winner scored for Chelsea against Swansea on Saturday but Jose Mourinho has told him he needs to toughen up if he is to become a regular starter in his title chasing side.

Sportsmail revealed that Wolfsburg were lining up a bid earlier this month although sporting director Klaus Allofs insisted: ‘There is nothing to it.’ 

Schurrle is keen on a return to Germany but is contracted to Chelsea until 2018. He was signed from Bayer Leverkusen in 2013 for £18million after Mourinho returned to Stamford Bridge from Real Madrid.

Wolfsburg are second in the table, nine points behind leaders Bayern Munich who they face on January 30 when the Bundesliga resumes after its winter break.

Chelsea also have interest from Roma in Mohamed Salah and held a meeting on Monday to discuss their £1m loan offer with a view to a permanent £11m transfer. 

Mourinho insisted his squad is too small to cope should they lose Salah and will want to find a replacement for Schurrle too should he be sold.
