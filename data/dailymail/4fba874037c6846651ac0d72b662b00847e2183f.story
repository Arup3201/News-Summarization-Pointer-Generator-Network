New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has campaigned to ban food and drinks loaded with salt, fat and sugar in the city but he has no problems feeding it to Sandy victims.

According to reports, the MREs - meals ready to eat - are loaded with more salt and fat than a McDonalds Big Mac and a 21-ounce Coke.

'I was told that folks shouldn’t eat these for more than two days straight,' said one person handing out the meals.

Mr No: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has campaigned to ban food and drinks loaded with salt, fat and sugar in the city but he has no problems feeding it to Superstorm Sandy victims

The $7 MREs were handed out last week at the city-run Restoration Center in Coney Island, according to the New York Post, where many residents still lack power and heat.

Made by the Indiana-based Ameriqual Group and distributed via the city’s Office of Emergency Management, the Post reports the Superstorm Sandy MREs include such entrees as home-style chicken with noodles and vegetables in sauce: 1,180 calories, 45 grams of fat (17 grams saturated), 1,330 milligrams of sodium and 64 grams of sugar. (A Big Mac packs 550 calories, 29 grams of fat and 970 milligrams of sodium.)

Dietitian Bonnie Taub-Dix told the Post the situation is a 'perfect storm for not feeling well' and said she’s already seeing patients with 'the Sandy five' — five extra pounds put on since the superstorm.

Bloomberg spokeswoman Samantha Levine
told the Post that food was not meant to be a long-term 
solution.

Mayor Bloomberg's bans go way back. In 2006, the New York City Board of 
Health approved Mayor Bloomberg's plan to ban trans fat in cooking oils within
the city's 24,000 food establishments. The plan gave restaurants 18 
months to make the change.

In October 2007, Bloomberg introduced
an initiative for chain restaurants to display calorie information on 
menus and menu boards.

McDonald's, Burger King and Starbucks previously 
listed these counts on their websites or posters, but Bloomberg wanted 
the information to be in plain sight. Counts began appearing on menus, 
such as this one from Chipotle, in 2008.

In January 2010, 
Bloomberg unveiled a plan to cut the amount of salt in packaged and 
restaurant food by 25 percent over a five-year period.

That same year he Before the big 
sugary drink ban proposal, Bloomberg in 2010 successfully lobbied New York City's 
Board of Health to ban the sale of sugary drinks in containers 
larger than 16 ounces in restaurants and other venues, in a move meant 
to combat obesity and encourage residents to live healthier lifestyles.

Beginning May 2011, smokers were no longer allowed to light up in 
New York's parks. Bloomberg proposed the plan in September 2010 to ban 
outdoor smoking in parks, beaches, marinas, boardwalks and pedestrian 
plazas, because of secondhand smoke's harmful effects.

Now, it is 
illegal to smoke in any of the city's 1,700 parks and open spaces. The 
punishment is a $50 fine.
