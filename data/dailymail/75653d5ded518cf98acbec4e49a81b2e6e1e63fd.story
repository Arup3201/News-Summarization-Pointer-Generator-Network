An American pilot who clearly had time on his hands may have produced the lewdest image ever using GPS flight data.

The pilot was behind the controls of a single-engine plane when he ‘drew’ a naughty image on a flight path over central Florida last night.

Screen grabs of the rude flight path have gone viral on the internet after they were shared by flight-tracking website Flightradar24.

It appeared to be a routine flight when the Van’s RV-12 plane departed Kissimmee, Florida shortly before 6:45pm local time.

The two-seater flew south-west towards Lakeland when it suddenly made a sharp turn towards the north and began to ‘draw’ the lewd image.

It continued on at an altitude of 1,800ft and then flew north-west towards the Gulf of Mexico before turning around and heading back to Kissimmee Gateway Airport, south of Orlando.

The single-engine plane appeared to ‘draw’ another lewd image shortly before it flew over Walt Disney World and landed in Kissimmee at about 9pm local time, according to Flightradar24, which provides real-time positioning and information for thousands of aircraft around the world.

But the plane soon made a sharp turn right - and it quickly became apparent what it was up to

The plane which flew the 50-mile path is registered to B&M Aviation LLC in Orlando, according to the Federal Aviation Administration’s online database.

It’s certainly not the first time GPS data has been used to ‘draw’ a lewd image, with many runners using their smartphone apps to create childish outlines.

But it has been put to better use.

Last year, artist Yasushi Takahashi left his job and travelled across Japan for six months to create a romantic marriage proposal.

He spelled out ‘Marry me’ and an image of a heart with an arrow through it while covering a distance of more than 4,300 miles, mostly on foot.

His effort was well worth it, as his girlfriend said yes to his proposal.
