A violent takeaway owner who stabbed one customer and whose staff were involved in attacks on nearly 20 others has lost his late night licence and been given a suspended prison sentence.

Rampaging  Bakir Ahmed Ali, 24, was caught on CCTV brandishing weapons and chasing a man out of UK Pizza in Peterlee, County Durham, with another member of staff before attacking him.

The shocking incident formed part of a litany of shame for the late night venue, with police attending the premises 17 times for violence or anti-social behaviour in just two years.

These call-outs allegedly involved staff attacking customers, Durham County Councilâ€™s statutory sub-licensing committee was told.

The committee heard police found two table legs and a hammer under the shop counter, which could have been used as weapons.

Durham Crown Court was told at a hearing 
in June Ali had snapped when his staff were racially abused, and stabbed 
the drunken customer who made the offensive remarks.

Mr Ali, who is a Kurdish Iraqi, was given a 12-month prison sentence suspended for 18 months after admitting unlawful wounding and possessing an offensive weapon in public.

And there was further bad news for the errant businessman when he lost his bid to stay open until 3am.

Sergeant Tim Robson told the 
licensing committee Ali has 'little control of his temper and the 
management of his staff and is unable to compose himself in a suitable 
way when dealing with drunk and perhaps violent or racially aggressive 
customers'.

Councillors decided the shop must close at 11pm, instead of its present 3am closing time.

Mr Ali told the committee: 'You will never hear of UK Pizza having any more problems.'

He has 21 days to appeal against the decision.
