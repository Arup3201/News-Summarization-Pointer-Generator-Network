A teenager trapped in a car with his disabled sister managed to keep calm while an aggressive marine raged outside – by turning up the radio and listening to AC/DC.

Mike McCurdy-Quintana was with his sister Bree - who is a marine herself and is now confined to a wheelchair following an injury - when the incident occurred and she caught his violent outburst on camera.

After the two cars touched bumpers, Sergeant Joshua Brigthman stormed out of the truck and approached the 19-year-old's window.

But instead of reasoning with him, Mr Brightman saw red - and threatened to kill him.

Mr McCurdy-Quintana locked the windows and turned up the radio, which was playing an AC/DC song, to drown out the marine’s expletive-laden tirade.

Infuriated that he was being ignored, Mr Brightman turned on Mr McCurdy-Quintana’s sister who was on her way to collect her three-year-old son from nursery in Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, San Diego, in the US.

Like her brother, she ignored the furious marine and concentrated on filming him on her camera phone.

Following the incident, Mr McCurdy-Quintana told Inside Edition that he wanted to diffuse the angry man.

Keeping calm: Mike McCurdy-Quintana turns up the radio to drown out the angry marine who goes mad after the 19-year-old knocks the bumper of his truck

He said: ‘I guess I just went into the "nothing zone." I just listened to the music and blocked him out and just kept staring.

‘Me looking at him, he would just have gotten more enraged, and I notice on the video at one point that I do look at him and he does get more enraged.

‘I was prepared to get out and confront the man, but as soon as he said, "I am going to f***ing kill you," I immediately locked the doors.’

What upset Mr McCurdy-Quintana most was the way the marine treated his sister.

The video shows Mr Brightman yelling, ‘Take a f***ing video you f***.’

‘It was uncalled for—for the words, and what he said to my sister. It's just disrespectful for anyone to hear those words.’

Mr Brightman, who is a veteran of Afghanistan and a recipient of the Purple Heart, a US medal awarded to those wounded or killed in action, later apologised.

But the teenager does not believe he is truly sorry.

Mr McCurdy-Quintana said: ‘The way he said it did not feel like it was sincere, whatsoever.’

No charges were filed at the time. Mr Brightman’s father Peter later spoke out to say his son’s behaviour was inappropriate, but that he was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress after serving two tours in Afghanistan.
