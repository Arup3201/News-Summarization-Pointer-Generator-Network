After scoring all four goals in Brazil's 4-0 rout over Japan in Singapore on Wednesday, Neymar warned the rest of the footballing world that even he does not know where his talent stops.

'My hair is standing on end. It's a great feeling. I don't know my own limits,' Neymar told Marca.

'It makes me very happy to achieve this dream. I couldn't have even imagined this in my wildest of dreams. I'm very happy and I thank God,' the Barcelona striker said. 

Neymar celebrates one of his four goals as Brazil thrashed Japan in a 4-0 victory.

Neymar needs 28 goals to beat Pele's record:

Pele: 77 goals, 92 caps

Ronaldo: 62 goals, 98 caps

Romario: 55 goals, 70 caps

Zico: 48 goals, 71 caps

Neymar: 40 goals, 58 caps 

And Neymar said the talk from Brazil coach Dunga before the game inspired his team to put Japan to the sword.

'He told us that the best way to show respect to your opponents is to do everything you can to beat them. And that's what we did.

'I tried to score the goals, not for my personal success, but to try and help my team-mates and the Brazil team in general.' 

After scoring for the 40th time for Brazil in only his 58th appearance, Neymar will be confident of eventually passing Pele's record of 77 goals.

And considering he is only 22, it is surely only a matter of time before he overtakes the legendary striker.
