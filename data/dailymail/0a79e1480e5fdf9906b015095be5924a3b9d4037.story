The man suspected of shooting dead two Work and Income staff members in Ashburton on Monday morning has been caught by New Zealand police.

Russel John Tully, also known as John Henry Tully, was found by police not far from Lake Hood, which is the search area officers had been searching for most of the day.

Tully is believed to have entered the  Work and Income office in Ashburton, about 90 kilometres south of Christchurch on New Zealand's South Island, and opened fire before fleeing the scene on his pushbike.

Canterbury district police commander Superintendent Gary Knowles said police dogs tracked Tully for some distance and that there was no stand-off and no shots were fired. 

Supt Knowles said he was suffering from minor dog bites and was taken to the Ashburton police station.

He will be medically examined before he is formally interviewed. No charges have yet been laid.

Officers surveyed the area hunting for Tully who allegedly fled the scene on his pushbike on Monday morning

One witness at the scene stopped his van in the middle of the road when he spotted a man wearing a black balaclava run into the centre wielding a gun.

He told the NZ Herald a staff member chased the gunman from the building after the shooting screaming: 'You bastard, you've blown her to bits!'.

The witness added he couldn't bring himself to go inside the office though: 'I didn't want to see that.'

Another witness who was inside during the gruesome shooting said he believed both the victims to be staff members at the Ashburton centre, and said he thinks the man broke down what he described as a shotgun and put it in his backpack upon leaving.

'It was incredibly loud, I could feel the air whoosh past my head,' the witness said speaking of the shots. 

Ashburton is located about 90 kilometres south of Christchurch, on the South Island of New Zealand

The shooting left two dead and another person in a serious but stable condition

At the press conference before finding Tully, Mr Knowles warned residents if there was no need for them to leave the house they should stay put. He said it was not a case of lock-down but people needed to be vigilant. 

'I think people need to be prudent - if they see anything suspicious, anyone in their back yards, anyone hiding in a shed, please contact us urgently, we want to find this guy', he said at the time.

Mr Knowles added that residents who lived by the Ashburton River should take extra precaution, following reports that the gunman may have fled in that direction.

The Ministry of Social Development Chief Executive Brendan Boyle told NZ Herald all their offices in Ashburton, Timaru and Christchurch had been shut down in light of the tragedy.

Additionally, schools and early childcare centres in the area had been contacted by authorities and students were being kept inside until more news came to light.
