Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Four of the last five league meetings between Burnley and Hull City have ended with a 1-0 scoreline.

Hull City won the last meeting between the two sides at Turf Moor in March 2013, but this ended a run of seven straight wins for the Clarets over the Tigers.

Burnley have scored with a lower proportion of their shots than any other team in the Premier League (6 per cent).

Burnley are the 10th side to fail to win any of their opening 10 Premier League matches of a single season. Three of the previous nine have survived.

The last time Burnley and Hull met in the top flight, the Clarets won 4-1 in an April 2010 KC Stadium meeting

Hull City have won just one of their last 10 Premier League away matches (W1 D4 L5).

Burnley have won just two of their last 18 home games in the Premier League (W2 D7 L9).

This is the 57th league meeting between Burnley and Hull but only the third in the top-flight.

After scoring in each of their opening eight Premier League games this season, Hull have now failed to score in their last two.

A defeat in this game will see Burnley match the record of their arch-rivals Blackburn in the 1996-97 season (W0 D4 L7). Rovers managed to avoid relegation that campaign.

Hull are the only Premier League team this season who don’t have at least one player to have featured in every minute of every game.
