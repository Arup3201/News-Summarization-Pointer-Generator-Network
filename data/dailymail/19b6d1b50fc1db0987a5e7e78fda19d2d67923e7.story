The distraught families of two British hostages beheaded at the hands of ISIS fanatics today came together in show of unity at a memorial service for one of the murdered men.

In a symbol of solidarity, Alan Henning's anguished wife and daughter linked armed with the family of David Haines as they attended the private memorial in honour of Mr Henning.

The 47-year-old taxi driver was beheaded by the British Islamtic State terrorist dubbed 'jihadi John' in a gruesome video released last month while on a second aid convoy to Syria to help refugees.

Father-of-two David Haines, who spent two decades protecting innocent civilians across the Third World, was also beheaded in September in a similarly disturbing video.

Before the service earlier today, Barbara and Lucy Henning walked into Eccles Parish Church, Greater Manchester, alongside Bethany and Michael Haines, Mr Haines's daughter and brother.

They were joined by dozens of mourners who donned vibrant yellow colours - a poignant reminder of the yellow ribbons which filled Mr Henning's hometown when it was believed the father would return home.

After the service, the family unveiled a memorial plaque at the church bearing her husband's name and the words 'Our Hero'.

Speaking at the service, which was held in lieu of his funeral, Mrs Henning told how her beloved husband had been killed for being 'selfless and caring'.

Crowds of local people gathered near the church to listen to the service, as it was played out on speakers

She also condemned his killers for using the banner of religion as an excuse to carry out their despicable crimes.

She said: 'We must never forget the reason why he went to Syria and the reason he was taken from us - for being what we all should be, selfless and caring.'  

She added: 'These people are hiding behind a peaceful religion to carry out their crimes against humanity.

'We know this because we have seen the outcry from Muslims across the globe, condemning their behaviour.

His two children Lucy and Adam joined their mother in laying the yellow flowers upon the stone 

There was also a floral tribute to Mr Henning, spelling out the word 'hero' in yellow blooms 

'I only hope that we can bring these people to justice or that they receive the justice they deserve in the next life. No god would ever condone the killing of innocent people.'  

Mrs Henning also paid tribute to the families of the other four hostages who are also believed to have been murdered by jihadi John: John Foley, Steven Sotloff, Mr Haines and Peter Kassig. 

She added that she 'hoped and prayed' that hostage John Cantlie, a photojournalist seized by militants in 2012, would be released and returned to his family 'so that they are spared the horror'.

The 43-year-old has appeared in a series of propoganda videos in which he is dressed in a Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuit and delivers messages, in the style of a news reader, to Western governments.  

Mr Henning, 47, was beheaded by British terrorist dubbed 'jihadi John' in a gruesome video released online last month during his second aid convoy to Syria where he travelled to help refugees

The service heard how Mr Henning had a brilliant sense of humour and had died because he was 'selfless and caring'

In a video published last night, Mr Cantlie said he accepted 'long ago' that his fate is 'overwhelmingly likely' to be the same as his 'cellmates'.

Mrs Henning also thanked those who had sent words on comfort in the aftermath of the tragedy.

She said she had taken courage from those who had told her that her husband would live through their two teenage children and any grandchildren she will one day have.  

She also revealed the her 'loving, witty and caring' husband was a great joker and a terrible snorer.

She told how, at the wedding of his nephew, where he was best man, Mr Henning produced two Hula Hoops instead of the rings. 

Rev Cyprian Yobera led the service, which is being held instead of a funeral for Mr Henning 

David Haines, 44, was killed by IS militants in Syria  after spending more than a year as a hostage

Mrs Henning asked for donations to be made to Hostage UK, a charity which helps the families of kidnap victims. 

In a statement she released before the memorial, Mrs Henning said her children may never understand why their father was taken from them.   

She said: 'Alan was a peaceful, selfless man who left his family in the UK at Christmas 2013 to drive in a convoy all the way to Syria with his Muslim colleagues and friends to help those most in need. We, as a family, are extremely proud of him.

'Lucy and Adam understood why he had to go, he had explained to them how he had seen children with nothing, living in tents and queuing for food and water, and how much harder it was for them in the middle of winter.

'Some of these children had lost their entire families, killed by their own country's leadership.

'On behalf of the entire family, I want to thank everyone who campaigned for Alan's release, who held vigils to pray for his safe return and who condemned those who took him.

'Your efforts were a great support to us and we take comfort in knowing how many people stood beside us in hoping for the best.'
