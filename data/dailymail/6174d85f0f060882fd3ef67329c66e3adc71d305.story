The BBC has sparked controversy with some of its Radio 2 presenters after it was suggested their programmes could be given a mark out of 10.

The idea, which was raised as part of a drive by bosses to look at how its programmes related to their audiences, has angered some of its big name presenters.

Each Radio 2 DJ’s programme is to be given its own ‘whiteboard’ on which a series of ‘measurables’, such as how many records were played, will be displayed.

But when presenters heard about the idea of also putting up a score out of 10 for their show they reacted with anger.

Insiders branded the suggestion ‘astonishing’ and said it was treating its presenters as if they were children.

One insider added there were also a ‘lot of angry producers’ over the plans as well.

One source told a website: ‘It’s reducing the whole thing to numbers. The idea that you can measure the success of a programme by a series of integers, it feels as if you are being treated like a child.

‘The things that really matter aren’t measurable. A presenter could hit all their numbers and still have a dull programme. Or they could miss all the targets but be making great radio.’

However it emerged last night that the idea of scoring its presenters has not been taken forward by bosses, perhaps in the light of the frosty reception it got from DJs.

BBC sources close to management played down the proposal yesterday saying it had merely been suggested by an individual as part of broader discussions. 

The closer analysis of its own shows comes despite the fact that the station had its biggest ever audience in the final three months of last year.

While it is unclear which presenters in particular are angered about the proposed marking system, the station’s talent includes names such as Simon Mayo, Chris Evans, Paul O’Grady and Steve Wright. 

A Radio 2 spokesman said: ‘It is routine good practice to discuss our programmes regularly to ensure we are offering listeners the best service possible.’
