British courts should be ‘more ready’ to ignore human rights rulings made by European judges in Strasbourg, the UK’s top judge has said.

Lord Neuberger, President of the Supreme Court, said British judges had been too keen to follow decisions made by the European Court of Human Rights – even when the decisions were ‘inconsistent’ and made by junior legal officers.

He claimed judges were beginning to see that such an approach would not be appropriate.

Lord Neuberger, in a speech to lawyers in Australia, admitted that it was controversial for British courts to be bound by decisions made in Strasbourg, France.

At a conference at the Supreme Court of Victoria in Melbourne he said: ‘UK judges have, I suspect, sometimes been too ready to assume that a decision, even a single decision of a section of that court, represents the law according to Strasbourg, and accordingly to follow it.

‘That approach is attributable to our common law attitude to precedent and to our relatively recent involvement with Strasbourg.

‘I think we may sometimes have been too ready to treat Strasbourg court decisions as if they were determinations by a UK court whose decisions were binding on us.

‘It is a civilian court under enormous pressure ... and whose judgments are often initially prepared by staffers, and who have produced a number of inconsistent decisions over the years.’

He added: ‘I think that we are beginning to see that the traditional common law approach may not be appropriate, at least to the extent that we should be more ready not to follow Strasbourg chamber decisions.’

Lord Neuberger said, in some respects, the UK had ‘much to learn’ from mainland Europe. But he said the UK had ‘just as much to offer’.
