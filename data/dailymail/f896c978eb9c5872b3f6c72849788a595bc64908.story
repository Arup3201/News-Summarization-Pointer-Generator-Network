Alexis Sanchez inspired Chile to a winning start at the World Cup - but they were forced to work hard by an Australia team who looked early on as if they would be utterly humiliated.

Living up to their 'dark horses' tag, Chile raced into a two-goal lead inside 16 minutes as Barcelona star Sanchez scored one and created another for Jorge Valdivia.

But the South Americans couldn't convert their possession into further goals and were caught cold when Tim Cahill headed Australia back into contention before half-time.

They wasted a number of good chances to gain a point in Cuiaba as Claudio Bravo was forced into good saves from Cahill and Mark Bresciano.

And in the end, it needed a stoppage time strike from Wiganâ€™s Jean Beausejour to make absolutely sure of Chileâ€™s opening night success.

With Holland demolishing defending champions Spain beforehand, any fears this match would come after the Lord Mayor's show were instantly dispelled. Chile's dark horses galloped away and it soon looked like being a procession.

The players gave a rousing a cappella crescendo to their national anthem and, powered by a sense of patriotic duty, tore into their timid opponents.

With their first attack of note, on 12 minutes, Charles Aranguiz did well to keep his balance and shield the ball from goalkeeper Maty Ryan sprawling at his feet.

Turning away from goal, he dug out a cross that was only half-cleared to the feet of Sanchez and the Barcelona star, unhurried by anyone in a yellow shirt, rattled the ball into the bottom corner.

It was his ninth goal in his last 12 international appearances and the highlight of a masterful first-half in which he tormented Jason Davidson with his pace, flair and trickery.

Before Australia could regroup, they were two in arrears. Sanchez collected the ball in midfield and charged to the edge of the penalty box.

With Eduardo Vargas drawing away Australian defenders like a magnet, Valdivia was left alone to smash the ball home. It was Chile con carnage.

The game had barely started, yet Chile were indulging in 'Ole' football to the delight of their thousands of fans who had made the relatively short trip to Cuiaba.

Back in 2010, the group containing Spain and Chile saw just eight goals in total. This time round, that tally had been matched in just 106 minutes as the frustrating caution of opening World Cup group games at the last tournament was thrown to the wind.

Chile dominated possession - their percentage share high in the seventies - and they hassled Australian players like Duracell bunnies whenever they didn't have the ball.

But their refusal to retreat and consolidate after taking a two-goal lead came back to bite them.

From absolutely nothing, Australia halved the deficit when Tim Cahill hung in the air above the static Gary Medel to place an inch-perfect right-wing cross past Claudio Bravo.

It was trademark, timeless Tim - the kind of header he has made a living out of for Millwall and Everton and the national team.

His fifth goal in his last five international games, he joined Holland's Robin van Persie in scoring at each of the 2006, 2010 and 2014 finals.

The Socceroos suddenly sprung to life and came close to equalising moments after when Cahill shot low and hard against the shins of Bravo.

The momentum continued to shift after half-time and, after Mexico vs Cameroon, the day's theme of disallowed goals continued when Cahill was correctly flagged offside as he headed Mathew Leckie's cross past the Chilean keeper.

Mark Bresciano then twisted his body to fire off a shot that seemed destined for the bottom corner until Bravo stretched out a strong hand to halt the ball.

Finally, Chile found a second wind and Vargas skipped through the Australian defence only to see Alex Wilkinson hack his poked effort off the goalline.

It was all Australian pressure in the final 10 minutes but they lacked a cutting edge and, as the clock ticked down, Beausejour found the bottom corner with an accurate low drive.
