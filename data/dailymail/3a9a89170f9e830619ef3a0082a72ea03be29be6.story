The man who allegedly led police on a wild chase through the streets of LA and carjacked a woman at gunpoint is said to be a known gang member. 

Aaron Lorta was shot and wounded by officers after the high speed pursuit that was caught on camera.

The 29-year-old was arrested after undergoing surgery and was said to be in a stable condition in hospital. Police said Lorta could face a number of charges, including carjacking.

Court records show the suspect has a long criminal history, including convictions for battery, assault with a deadly weapon, grand theft auto, and attempted robbery, KNBC-TV reported. 

Lorta was held on $100,000 bail. It wasn't immediately known if he has a lawyer.

Aaron Lorta, 29, has been arrested on suspicion of carjacking after the high speed chase through the streets of LA

Unbelievable: A shocking car chase unfolded in Los Angeles on Monday that saw a driver zoom through red lights at a massive city intersection--and that was just the start of a pursuit that lasted some 40 minutes across miles

Reckless: The car was reported as stolen before the driver took police on the unforgettable chase across much of Los Angeles. Here, the driver speeds recklessly onto a median after weaving through traffic going the wrong way

In pursuit: After clipping several cars and nearly smashing into others, the car barreled down a turning lane as helicopters buzzed overhead and the police were hot on his tail

Turn for the worse: The car soon dangerously hooks a left through oncoming traffic

Spinning out of control: While the driver manages to cut through oncoming traffic with no problem, he sounds finds himself spinning out of control

Worsening: The car soon clips a white truck at right and then barrels uncontrollably toward the white car at top 

Fight or flight? The driver soon smashes into the white car and finds himself at a standstill and with a decision to make

Flight: The driver leaps from the car and takes off on foot along a Los Angeles roadway

Armed: The man approaches a car with what appears to be a gun and opens the door

Carjacking: The driver of the car flees as the man gets in and drives off once more

Chase continues: With the first car still visible in the picture, the driver peels out as at least eight squad cars follow after him

Stuck: As the sun set over Los Angeles, the car found itself wedged between two other cars and unable to move further

The chase began at around 5pm on Monday after officers answered a report of a possible stolen car in Boyle Heights, east of downtown Los Angeles,  police said.

Footage shows the vehicle travelling at between 50 and 60mph on city streets as it ignores stop lights, races through intersections and weaves through traffic.

 The Toyota Camry sped through South Gate and other cities southeast of Los Angeles.

It hit at least four cars at least four times before the driver lost control and it careered into a vehicle near an intersection. 

The man, wearing a white T-shirt, jumped out and tried to steal another car as television news helicopters hovered overhead. 

The driver then pulled out what appeared to be a gun, stole the second car from a Elizabeth Yarahuan, 22.

'He just came up to me and pointed the gun at me and told me to get out of my car,' Elizabeth Yarahuan, 22, told KABC-TV as she tried to fight back tears. 'I unbuckled myself, and I opened the door and ran out. It was horrible. I don't wish that on nobody.' 

Car theft attempt 3: The suspect tried and failed to carjack a third car, the SUV pictured here

Runs for it: The driver bolts though a busy roadway after unsuccessfully trying to jack the SUV

Theft attempt 4: The suspect tries to steal a car yet again as he flees police on foot

Taken down: The suspect is finally taken down in the street, apparently by a police bullet

The police swarmed the suspect before he was eventually hauled away in an ambulance suffering from unknown injuries

He raced along Interstate 710 and state Route 60 with at least eight patrol cars in pursuit.

The car veered onto an off-ramp and then a Montebello street, where it became wedged between two other vehicles in traffic.

The man jumped out and pulled open a door on a stopped SUV as police chased him. He tried to stop another car, but it took off before officers opened fire.

No officers were hurt.

Driver Martha Duron said she was fine after her car was sideswiped, but it could easily have been different.

'If he would've hit me hard, in the front, I would've been gone,' she told KCAL-TV. 'He was going so fast.'

Police opened fire as the man appeared to be trying to steal another car.
