A businessman stabbed his estranged partner to death after being 'profoundly affected' by taking part in a BBC reality TV show, a court heard yesterday.

John Butler, 62, stabbed and slashed Pauline Butler, 61, to death in a frenzied attack because he wrongly believed she was seeing another man, it was alleged.

He left her dying on the floor of her flat and then returned home to open a beer and smoke a cigar, the jury was told, while his sons rushed to her aid.

The court heard how featuring in the 2012 business makeover programme The Fixer, hosted by celebrity consultant Alex Polizzi, had caused the couple to argue.

Miss Polizzi had tried to turn around the fortunes of the family's firms – Kettley's Furniture Store and Kettley's Funeral Directors – in Yeadon, West Yorkshire.

But Butler had been resistant to the changes she made, the court heard.

His eldest son David, 31, told Leeds Crown Court: 'Two years ago I noticed a significant change in my father in the shop, in what he was doing and saying. The biggest change was when we went on television.

'The show's makers wanted to change a lot of things in the shop. Me and my family wanted the changes, but he didn't.

'The top designer came in and said how it should look, but my father disagreed.

'There was a top professional and lots of other people were coming into the business my father and uncle had built up, and saying things to him.

'He was going off in a huff and people were coming in and ripping up the carpets. He had put a lot of effort into the business, and when you see someone coming from the outside world and doing that to your business it does have a profound effect on you.'

Although the couple were not married, Miss Butler had changed her surname by deed poll. 

The court heard she had fallen out of love with her partner and felt aggrieved at his lack of support when she had battled breast cancer ten years ago.

They began leading separate lives, watching television apart in different rooms of the family home, before Miss Butler moved out in March.

On April 14, Butler, who denies murder, went to the nearby flat where she was living, believing she was seeing another man, the court heard. 

Prosecutor Michelle Colborne, QC, said: 'He lost his temper, old-fashioned good and simple. He picked up a knife and stabbed her in what the prosecution say was a sustained attack.

'It was done with the intention of killing Pauline Butler or causing her serious harm.'

When the family's business was featured in the show, the BBC programme said: 'Kettley's Furniture has been run by John Butler and his family for 33 years, but it just hasn't moved on in that time'

The jury heard he then washed the knife, left it on the draining board, put her dog in the car, locked up and drove home.

The couple's middle son, Richard, saw his father walk in with blood on his face, carrying a blood-stained orange towel. 

Butler told him: 'You need to call the police, I think I have killed your mother', the court heard.

Butler wept in court as his eldest son gave evidence.

David said: 'My father is emotionally a very private man, doesn't wear his heart on his sleeve. He's a born and bred Yorkshireman who doesn't say what he feels.' David added that he was never told his parents weren't married.

The court heard the night before the alleged murder, David handed his mother £100 for maintenance from his father.

David said Miss Butler 'went mad and said she wanted half the house', which was worth around £500,000. 'When she was given the money ... she said she thought it was an insult,' he said.

Miss Butler was also visited by her youngest son Paul that evening, and she told him she felt her children were taking their father's side. David added: 'She expressed hatred of my father. She refused to even touch or give me a hug.'

Commenting on his evidence, he told the jury: 'I'm not here to defend my father, I'm not on the side of my mother either.

'It's a tragedy and I'm here to tell the truth on both parts. What happens happens. I know I have lost both my parents.'

Mr Justice Edis told the jury not to seek out the episode of the BBC programme featuring the family. 'It is undesirable for people who have seen it and remember it to serve on this jury,' he said.

'It touches on the defendant and his family life and you might get a view, favourable or unfavourable, if you watch him on the telly. So don't watch him on the telly.'

Butler told police he had gone to his estranged partner's flat to mend her microwave. He said they argued and she pushed him, causing him to lose his balance and fall on to her with a knife.
