This is the heartwarming moment British tennis player Naomi Broady gets a kiss from her proud niece as she celebrates getting through to the second round at Wimbledon.

The 24-year-old was embraced by her four-year-old niece Lola-Rose after sealing her first-round victory over Hungarian Timea Babos.

British number four Broady, ranked 164 in the women's game, beat the world number 94 by two sets to one to seal her first ever grand slam victory.

Broady, a former under-18 UK girls' champion, entered the famous tournament as a wild card, and came from a set down to beat Babos.

Her win comes after she spoke out about how she was embroiled in a scandal which threatened her career after posting a photograph of herself posing next to a condom machine on a night out seven years ago online.

Broady maintained that the picture, uploaded to social network Bebo, was taken on an innocent girls' night out, but after it caught the attention of the press the Lawn Tennis Association cut her funding, putting her career at risk.

To this day she has no coach and travels alone to tournaments.

'I don’t know why it was such a big deal,' Broady told the Mail on Sunday.

'I
 wasn’t drunk and I wasn’t doing drugs either. I was trying to live, for
 a few nights at least, as a normal 17-year-old. It was blown out of all
 proportion.

‘I
 was disgusted with how the LTA handled things. They warned me the 
picture would be appearing in the next day’s newspapers, but I heard 
nothing after that.'

Broady said the picture had 'tarnished' her with a 'bad girl reputation'.

Her
 property developer father Simon was so disgusted with the LTA's 
decision to axe his daughter's funding that he pulled her younger 
brother Liam, then 13, out of the LTA programme.

He also sold the family home
 to finance their careers instead.

When the LTA offered Miss Broady funding again the following year, it was turned down on principle.

The family continued its boycott until last year when Liam, now 20 and on the men’s circuit, decided to accept LTA funding again – a move that has angered his father to the point where they are no longer on speaking terms.

'It’s a very touchy subject,' Broady, who also has a sister and another brother, said.

'Dad says he was trying to protect us, but now Liam is older and has to pay for tennis himself. It’s a difficult family issue. I try to stay out of it.'

But she insists she will not follow her brother’s example. ‘I don’t want their money and now  I have the prize money from Wimbledon I don’t need it,’ she said. ‘I won’t be bought by them after everything that’s happened.

Win: Broady beat the world 94 to progress to the second round of Wimbledon

Against all odds: Since the row Broady has refused to accept funding from the LTA

‘I still to this day don’t understand what we did wrong.  If I want to have a night out then I will. If it’s going to affect my tennis, then I won’t do it because tennis is my priority.

‘The LTA certainly weren’t trying to protect me. The LTA only wanted what was best for them.’

A spokesman for the LTA said: ‘We have moved on and are glad that Naomi is doing well on court. We wish her the very best.’
