Everton youngster Ryan Ledson has has praised first team boss Roberto Martinez for giving youth a chance to shine at Goodison Park.

Ledson, who joined Everton's academy at the age of five, made his senior professional debut earlier this season when he started the Toffees' Europa League defeat against Krasnodar in a game which saw Martinez blood several youngsters.

Despite suffering defeat, the 17-year-old revealed he'll never forget his debut for his boyhood club.

Ledson told Bleacher Report: 'It was brilliant; being a Scouser, and going to the games all the time, and then getting onto the pitch … you just want more of it.

'The gaffer [Martinez], he gives the young lad a chance - he did it at Wigan and he has definitely done it here up until now.

'That’s what he wants, he wants us progressing, and maybe a few of us get brought up to the first-team.'

Ledson made his Everton debut in the 1-0 Europa League defeat against Krasnodar in December            

The midfielder, who also captained the England Under-17s to European Championship success last year, also revealed that he plans to work his way into the Toffees first team within the next five years.

When asked where he sees himself in 2020, Ledson added: 'Right here. Staying here, and in the first team.'
