A contestant on the Vietnamese version of MasterChef caused outrage when she punched the belly of a live turtle and then beheaded it with a large cleaver.

Hundreds of appalled viewers complained when Khanh Phuong, 21, was shown hacking at the turtle's head which was peaking out of its shell. 

The contestant first used a wooden stick but after losing patience and thumping the belly of the turtle with her fist, then used a pair of scissors and a knife to force the bloodied head out.

Then, pinning the roof of its mouth to a wooden chopping board with a blade, Miss Phuong screamed as she sliced its head off with a large cleaver.

Following the graphic episode, there was a backlash from shocked viewers in Vietnam, with 70 per cent saying in an online poll they should not have been broadcast. 

Miss Phuong also said she was embarrassed when viewing the scene and said she had killed the turtle in a 'very cruel' way. 

She also said she 'could not sleep well' since beheading the animal. 

In the episode broadcast on VTV3, the contestants were challenged to prepare a meal using live animals, including two kinds of fish and a turtle.

Miss Phuong has expressed regret for what happened and says she is embarrassed by the 'very cruel' killing 

The MasterChef Vietnam spin-off is now in its second series and the show is broadcast on VTV3

The boss of the TV channel revealed it had been 'an accident' to show the footage and was 'stupefied' after it was aired.

Lai Van Sam said: 'Allowing such a violent scene to air was an accident. Sometimes we have to watch too many programmes a day and only inattention causes us to miss such scenes.

'We stood there stupefied after it was broadcast.'  

Chef and judge on the show Tuan Hai (far right) defended the beheading saying it was a situation that every chef had to deal with 

In July 2014, Masterchef Australia made international headlines when it displayed the Indian flag upside down. In the episode, contestants had to prepare dishes from different national cuisines.

But when the Indian flag was revealed from underneath a silver dish-cover the flag was upside down, with the saffron segment at the bottom and the green at the top. 

In August 2013, it was reported that the UK'S MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace punched a man five times at a dinner he was hosting at the Wood Norton Hotel in Worcestershire for allegedly touching his girlfriend.

Josh Marks, a 7'2" tall basketball player and runner-up on season three of US MasterChef was arrested in July 2013 after a bizarre confrontation with University of Chicago police in which he told officers he'd been possessed by Gordon Ramsay who turned him into God. 

But chef Tuan Hai, a judge on the show, said it was a situation every chef had to deal with.

'The image was related to and is part of the story. Dealing with live animals involves situations that every cook must overcome. 

'Watching such scenes, viewers can find out more about the candidate’s character.'

The MasterChef format, which is franchised around the world, is based on the UK original, but is down to production companies in each country to decide on content. 

It is in its second series in Vietnam and the controversial episode was broadcast on September 20. 

The Shine Group, which licences the show worldwide, said: 'We work closely with each licensee of the MasterChef format globally outside of the UK.

'Though what is considered acceptable to eat, and how it is prepared, can vary greatly in different countries' cultures, we strongly discourage tasks which feature the preparation of live animals. 

'Unfortunately the production company in Vietnam made us aware of the item only after it had been aired. It was clearly an unacceptable and regrettable incident.'
