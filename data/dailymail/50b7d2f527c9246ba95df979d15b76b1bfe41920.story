A previously unseen collection of photos from the wedding of John F. Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline will be auctioned off this month. 

The unpublished negatives were taken by freelance photographer Arthur Burges, who was asked to be a backup photographer when the Kennedys wed in Newport, Rhode Island, on September 12, 1953.

They were discovered in his darkroom by his family after his death in 1993.
