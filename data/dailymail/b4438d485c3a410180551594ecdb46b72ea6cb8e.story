Denise Welch today faces fresh allegations that she cheated on her husband - this time with a gay toyboy who claims he met her at a wake.

Tom Hopkins, 26, said that the Celebrity Big Brother winner was the 'first girl' he had ever been with and that he fell in love during their four-month 'relationship.'

Another toyboy: Tom Hopkins claims he had a four-month affair with Welch

'I remember her saying to someone she could have anyone she wanted, but for some reason she had fallen in love with me,' the theatre producer told The Sun.

A spokesman for Welch today denied the pair had had a relationship, saying  'We believe these allegations to be false'.

Mr Hopkins is the second man in 24 hours to allege he has had an affair with 53-year-old Welch, who is married to actor Tim Healy.

Party planner Lincoln Townley, 39, told The Sunday Mirror he had seen the actress for eight months.

Mr Hopkins claims he met Welch in a London pub, where the wake was held, before sharing a taxi. During the journey, he told her he was gay.

He said: 'She started kissing me and
 stuff happened. She was basically semi-naked in the taxi. The taxi 
driver just carried on driving.'

The pair drove to a hotel in Mayfair where Mr Hopkins said mother-of-two Denise decided to take her dress off.

In scenes reminiscent of her serial flashing on CBB, she then reportedly ran down the street in only her underwear.

'It was 4am or 5am and dark so no one spotted her,' Mr Hopkins said.

He then went on to claim they met for
 lunch dates and talked 'incessantly' on the phone - despite Welch being married for 23 years.

He showed The Sun a series of text messages, including one saying: 'I'm your fiancée not your wife!! Maybe we rushed things xxxx'.

The affair allegedly took place 
during the sixth series of Dancing On Ice last year. Mr Hopkins said he 
would stay with Welch in her Holiday Inn hotel room.

She would introduce him as her best friend.

Welch was crowned CBB winner on Friday after beating X Factor reject  Frankie Cocozza to first place.

Yesterday, 
the former Coronation Street star shrugged off the rumours, cheekily 
flashing her husband during his 60th birthday celebrations.

They had woken up to The Sunday Mirror's report about her alleged affair with Mr Townley.

One of his friend's told the 
newspaper that Welch met Townley at the Jet Black club in London last 
April after filming Loose Women and had even spent the night with her 
before she went into the Celebrity Big Brother house.

He added: 'They started seeing each other on a 
casual basis. Lincoln said she was the same away from the ­cameras as 
she was on TV. He saw the Loose Woman in her come out when they were 
partying together.'

The 
friend added that Welch would stay at his home occasionally but they 
would mostly spend time in her hotel room near the Loose Women studios 
after the show had been filmed and then she would head home to Cheshire 
the following day.

'Lincoln said they have a great time 
­together, the age difference doesn’t matter. She is a party girl, 
without doubt. He loves being with her because she’s such great fun. It 
was very casual and all about ­having fun. ­Lincoln enjoyed it because 
there was no emotional stress.'

Lincoln
 is even believed to have told friends that he was surprised that Welch never tried to hide their relationship and they were always seen 
together at bars and restaurants in central London.

But by the early autumn, the friend said their relationship started to get more serious and Welch began talking openly about her marriage problems and said she felt she was living a 'double life'.

Last night, Welch issued a statement  saying: ‘It’s Tim's 60th birthday and we 
are celebrating that and the fact that mummy is home after three weeks in 
the BB house. We are not interested in the Sunday Mirror article.’

The actress has been candid about her previous affairs, both on Loose Women and in her autobiography.

In an interview last May, she said: 'There
is a perception that Tim is the long-suffering husband and I’m bad 
Denise. It’s not true. We’ve both, by our own admission, strayed.'
