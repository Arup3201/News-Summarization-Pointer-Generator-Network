Grandmother Melinda Walker is not just a Guitar Hero, she is an all-round wonder woman after she managed to fend off burglars using just the computer game's console.

It was the third time that Melinda Walker has faced intruders at her home in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and this time she decided they would be leaving empty-handed.

She was asleep on Sunday morning when three men broke in through her front door.

Melinda Walker managed to turn her grandson's Guitar Hero controller into a way of defending herself when she awoke to intruders in her house

She was upstairs when three young men broke into her house on Sunday, demanding her cash and her TV

She sprung into action when she heard the commotion, fearing for her five-year-old grandson's safety.

Armed with just the toy guitar, Ms Walker confronted the men aged between 15 and 21.

With their faces covered by hooded jumpers, they told her they had a gun and demanded her television and cash.

One of them threatened to take the gun out and 'clean it on her'.

However, she bent down to pick up her grandson's 
toy guitar and brandished it at the men while shouting 'get out of my 
house' and smacking one of them with it.

Ms Walker reenacted the moment she resourcefully grabbed the toy guitar and began smacking the men out of her house

She showed TV cameras how she chased the men downstairs and back out through the front door

Determined Ms Walker said it would have been the third time she was burgled and this time she could not let them get away with it

She chased them down the stairs and they escaped in a sedan-style car.

'All I thought of was,' Ms Walker told local TV station WANE, '"you're getting away from my grandson."'

Ms Walker said that she had a message for the intruders: 'I may not be a strong woman, I may not be a well woman, but you're not getting my stuff'.

Last time she was burgled a thief stole her flat-screen television.
