A supermarket worker waded through broken glass to save a pedigree cat which was tied up with elastic bands and dumped in a bottle bank. 

The Russian Blue, nicknamed Lucky following her ordeal, was thrown in the bin with its legs bound with elastic bands and a plastic bag tied around its head.

Diane Barnett climbed over jagged glass and broken bottles to rescue the feline from the bin at Asda in Blyth, Northumberland.

The mother-of-two, 46, told the Sunday Express: 'It looked like it had died but moved as it heard my voice.

'There are no words to describe how I feel about the people who have done this'.

The alarm was raised by a shopper who informed members of staff at the supermarket.

An investigation has now been launched by the RSPCA which described the incident as one of the worst cases of animal cruelty it had dealt with recently.

It is believed the cat was snatched from off a street before it was dumped in the bottle bank. 

The cat luckily did not suffocate because there was a rip in the plastic bag. 

Trevor Walter, RSPCA inspector, said the animal would have suffered a slow and agonising death if it had not been found. 

'It is up there with some of the worst I have experienced and I have seen some terrible things.'

Lucky the cat is now being cared for by the RSPCA in Chester-le-Street in County Durham.
