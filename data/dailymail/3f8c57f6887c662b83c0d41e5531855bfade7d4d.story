The former club of rapist footballer Ched Evans is split over whether the £3million striker should be re-signed, it has been claimed.

Sheffield United last week denied rumours the striker was set to be offered a new two-year contract worth £500,000 following his release from prison - but admitted they were continuing to 'deliberate' on a decision.

But this morning it has been reported that the club's board are split over whether to let the disgraced Welsh striker play for them again.

The 25-year-old left Wymott Prison last Friday having served half of a five-year sentence.

He has maintained his innocence despite being found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in his home town of Rhyl, North Wales, insisting it was ‘consensual and not rape’.

The Sun quotes a source as saying: 'Club bosses seem to think having Ched back is the right thing. They want to help rehabilitate him.

'But some of the board are still uneasy. They could still be a few weeks away from making public their decision.'

The newspaper reports that the club have declined to comment further.

Ched Evans issued a statement with his girlfriend Natasha Massey pleading for a second chance to play football again - and insisted he was innocent

Last week co-chairmen Kevin McCabe and Jim Phipps issued a joint statement denying reports that they have offered Evans a new contract.

They described the reports as 'false and damaging to the club' but added: 'We have made a statement on this matter previously and the lack of credibility and substance from this latest media report does not warrant any expansion from previous comments apart from noting that we are continuing to deliberate on any long term decision about Ched Evans.' 

Earlier this week it was reported that an online petition against Evans returning to Sheffield United had gained more than 150,000 signatures.

Evans broke his silence for the first time on Wednesday to apologise to his girlfriend Natasha Massey, 25.

But he was criticised for not mentioning his victim - who had previously been named by trolls on Twitter and forced to change her name as a result.

In the statement he said he has 'constantly regretted my act of infidelity and the damage that has been done on so many fronts because of it'.

He added: 'It is a rare and extraordinary privilege to be permitted to play professional football. Now that I've served the custodial part of my sentence of two and a half years, it is my hope that I will be able to return to football.

But he said he was 'determined to continue to fight to clear my name' and has now submitted his case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission.
