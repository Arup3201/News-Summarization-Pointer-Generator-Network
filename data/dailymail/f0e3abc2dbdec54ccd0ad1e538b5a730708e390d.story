Not many people would appreciate a kick to the face from an opponent, let alone offer to shake their hand afterwards... unless that opponent is Ronaldinho, of course. 

During a clash between Mexico's Queretaro and Club America in the Liga MX on Friday night - which Queretaro won 3-2 - Jesus Molina was left seeing stars; but it wasn't because he was in awe of the Brazilian World Cup winning hero.

Half-way through the first half, Molina and the former Barcelona and AC Milan midfielder challenged for a high ball.

Ronaldinho goes in high on Club America opponent Jesus Molina in their Liga MX clash on Friday night 

The Brazilian star sticks the boot in for Queretaro, with whom he signed a two-year contract in September 

The referee awarded Club America the foul, but didn't deem it necessary to book Ronaldinho after the incident

Rather than using his head, Ronaldinho went in high with his boot, leathering the poor Club America player in the face  

Interestingly enough Molina offered a truce with the culprit, who was not punished for his offence. 

Although the Samba star wasn't on the scoresheet that night, his side were victorious with an injury time winner.
