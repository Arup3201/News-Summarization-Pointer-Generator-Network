A British businessman who escaped jail by fleeing Dubai after having an affair with a married mother has returned to the country to try and get the conviction quashed, MailOnline can reveal. 

Brian Clark was convicted in Dubai Misdemeanours Court in 2009 of having illicit sex with Marnie Pearce. 

Ms Pearce, a 46-year-old British mother-of-two, was convicted of adultery in the strictly Islamic United Arab Emirates when her husband Ihab El Labban accused her of cheating on him. 

She was jailed for three months and lost custody of her two sons in a notorious case that made headlines around the world.

Jailed: Marnie Pearce made headlines around the world when she was jailed for adultery after allegedly having an affair with Brian Clark in Dubai. She then lost custody of her two sons

Counter claim: Ms Pearce claims that her husband, Ihab El Labban, above, made up the adultery claim to win custody. She then went on to allege that it was HE who was having the affair

In an ironic twist, Ms Marnie's husband then moved in with the American woman she said HE was having an affair with - but escaped scot-free.

And in the latest development in the six-year saga, oil-worker Mr Clark is trying to get the case quashed because more than five years have passed since the original conviction.

His lawyer Yousuf Hammad told Dubai Misdemeanours Court: 'My client is a married man and a father and lives a happy and stable life. His family depends on him.

'He was sentenced in absentia more than five years ago. We ask the court to dismiss the case due to time lapse.'

Ms Pearce was embroiled in a lengthy, bitter and eventually futile battle with her husband to keep her children.

The pair married in a dream wedding in the Seychelles in 1999 but not long after their sons Laith, now 13, and Zaid, 10, were born, the marriage fell apart.

According to Ms Pearce, a former florist and teaching assistant, they split acrimoniously after she discovered he had been having an affair with American former actress Tonya Thompson, 52.

The U.S. businesswoman met Mr El Labban, 47, while visiting Dubai in 2007. His wife said she threw him out after discovering a love letter from Miss Thompson.

But her nightmare began in March 2008 when Mr El Labban told police it was she who was having an affair.

Anguish: Ms Pearce was caught on video handing over the boys after going on the run for a month with them

Adultery is a criminal offence in the UAE and Ms Pearce contends her estranged husband hurled accusations in a bid to win sole custody of their children.

Police who raided her family home found her having tea with Mr Clark, the brother of Ms Pearce's friend, who was visiting Dubai.

Despite her claims the friendship was innocent and she had only met Mr Clark three times, officers seized five used condoms and emails. 

The condoms bearing her DNA (although Mr Clark was never tested) were enough to seal her conviction in November 2008, although she maintained they were planted by Mr El Labban, a former executive with pharmaceuticals firm Procter & Gamble.

She appealed and had the sentence reduced to three months in February 2009. Crucially though, she lost custody of her sons.

She went on the run for a month to enjoy a few last precious moments with her children, but then handed over the sobbing boys in heartrending scenes outside Dubai criminal courts and gave herself in.

'I was searched and most of my personal items were confiscated,' she said on her release. 'I had to beg the woman guard to let me keep five photos of the children.

'I was strip-searched. I felt so humiliated.'

During her time in prison, she shared cells with murderers and prostitutes and lost nearly a stone.

The thought of seeing her boys again kept her going.

'Speaking to them on the phone kept me sane,' she said at the time. 'Yet at one point, Ihab wouldn't let me. It was torture.'

She insisted: 'I have done nothing wrong. I am a good mother and while my ex-husband would not hurt a hair on the children's heads, what he is doing is wrong.

Love quadrangle: Mr El Labban married Tonya Thompson in 2010 and has set up home with her in Florida

'I never had an affair. This all feels unreal. I knew I would be going to prison and just wanted four weeks with my babies so I could spend as much time with them as possible and so they would know I never intended to leave them.'

Mr El Labban, meanwhile, contended: 'I am the victim in this. Marnie has done horrible things.'

She was eventually released and her compulsory deportation order waived so she could stay in Dubai and have access to the children.

Mr El Labban, in the meantime, married Miss Thompson in 2010 and moved in with her in Orlando - but not before bringing a civil lawsuit claiming emotional and psychological damage and being awarded £3,500 compensation from Ms Pearce.

In the latest twist, Mr Clark is pushing to get the case thrown out.

Mr Hammad told the court: 'The defence will not discuss the details of the crime considering it is more than five years old.

'We are seeking to have the legal action halted against the defendant and have the case dropped. My client's family is waiting for him.'

Just why he is seeking to face justice after all this time is unclear.
