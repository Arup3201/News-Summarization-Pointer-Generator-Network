An executive at the world’s second-biggest consumer goods company told a conference that food is 'too cheap' and far too much is being wasted as a result.

Jan Kees Vis, the global director for sustainable sourcing development at Unilever said that half of the food that is purchased in the city of London is never eaten.

He added that consumers and catering firms do not put enough value on the food that they buy, even though the cost of meals and snacks in supermarkets, takeaways and restaurants, The Daily Telegraph reported.

Waste: An executive at Unilever says food is 'too cheap' and is being wasted, driving up production needs as the global population grows

'Places that offer food for lunch – chilled, day-fresh [food] - have made incredible growth, but the result is a lot of food is wasted,' he said.

'A big factor in why we waste so much food is that food has become too cheap. If it weren’t, we wouldn’t waste so much of it,' said Mr Vis.

WRAP, the food waste group, said Britons throw away 7.2 million tonnes of household waste each year, around £680 of food per family. The group adds that around 4.4 million tonnes of this is edible food.

Mr Vis, speaking to the CropWorld Global 2012 conference in London, said that food waste usually takes place in restaurants or people’s homes.

As prices rise, driven by a growing global population, Mr Vis said that if people could bring down levels of waste the increase in production required would slow down.

Recent research by Unilever, which makes brands including Flora margarine, Marmite and Hellman’s mayonnaise, found that people throw away food primarily because it goes off too quickly, leftovers are not eaten, and too much food is prepared in the first place.

Andy Dawe, WRAP’s head of food and drink, told the newspaper: 'Food waste is a serious issue, increasingly so. Although the percentage of consumer income spent on food has fallen for decades, more recently there has been significant food inflation.

'UK households currently throw away 4.4 million tonnes of food which could have been eaten, costing around £680 a year for the average family with children.

'This is money that could be saved if we made the most of the food we buy.'

The good news is Britons are actually throwing away less than they were. Between 2007 and 2010, households reduced their food waste by 1.1 million tonnes.

Earlier this year fast food restaurants, pubs, hotels and catering firms, such as Greggs and McDonalds, agreed new voluntary targets to cut food waste over the next three years.
