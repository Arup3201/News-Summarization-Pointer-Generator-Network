Silver could be a precious weapon in the fight against antibiotic resistance.

Scientists have shown that giving tiny amounts of silver at the same time as antibiotics makes the drugs up to a thousand times more effective.

The finding comes in the wake of warnings by Britain’s top doctor that the rise of drug-resistant superbugs could trigger an ‘apocalyptic scenario’ in which even routine operations such as hip surgery become deadly because we have run out of antibiotics.

Professor Dame Sally Davies said that unless urgent action is taken, the ‘ticking timebomb’ of growing antibiotic resistance could leave millions vulnerable to untreatable bugs within a generation.

U.S. researcher Dr Jim Collins said: ‘The number of antibiotic resistant strains in our hospitals and communities is growing and is growing dramatically and has been for some time.

‘And this development is accompanied by a drop in new antibiotics being developed and approved.

‘We are taking a different approach. Instead of trying to develop a completely new antibiotic, we are trying to enhance the ones we already have.’

In experiments on mice, the Boston University researchers found that giving silver with antibiotics made them between ten and a thousand times better at fighting infections.

In some cases, bugs classed as antibiotic resistant became treatable.

Although silver has long been known to have anti-bacterial properties, if used alone, it has to be given in such high amounts that it can be poisonous to the body.

The experiments suggest it will be safe to use it in very small amounts with existing antibiotics.

The drugs could be laced with silver or covered in a fine coating of the precious metal and used to tackle dangerous stomach bugs, urinary tract infections or hard-to-treat films of bacteria that coat catheters.

The research, detailed in the journal Science Translational Medicine, also worked out how silver helps kill bugs.

The metal makes bacteria more ‘leaky’, allowing antibiotics to get inside them and kill them.

Plus, it boosts production of dangerous oxygen molecules that aid and abet the death.
