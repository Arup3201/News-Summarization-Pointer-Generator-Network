A heroic RAF pilot who helped defend Britain during the Second World War has died before he was able to see his flying boat raised from the sea where it sank in 1940.  

Wing Commander Derek Martin OBE was the last person to fly the Sunderland aircraft before it sank during a fierce storm at the dock where it was based.  

After he helped historians identify the plane, they started to bring it up from the seabed - but the job was not finished by the time Mr Martin died last month at the age of 93.  

He was an instructor at a training unit based in Pembroke Dock, West Wales when he last flew the Sunderland bomber in 1940 as part of his duties training young airmen.

Mr Martin later joined 210 Squadron in Oban, and was badly injured in a crash in 1941.  

He was treated by the renowned plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe and became a member of the exclusive 'Guinea Pig Club', formed of patients who had undergone experimental procedures.  

In 1943, Mr Martin returned to flying duties at Pembroke Dock and after the war remained in the RAF for some years, eventually settling in the Berkshire village of Colnbrook with his wife Betty.  

The Sunderland bomber was flown from Pembroke Dock during the crucial Battle of the Atlantic, which saw the RAF target German U-boats sinking Allied supply ships.  

The battle raged between 1940 and 1943, killing 6,000 RAF crew who flew up to 600 miles into the Atlantic - but without their efforts, Britain might have been starved into submission by the submarines.

Winston Churchill wrote: 'The only thing that ever really frightened me during the war was the U-boat peril.'  

Shortly before his death, Mr Martin said: 'Sunderlands were the only long range British aircraft which could reach the middle of the Atlantic for the first couple of years of the war.  

'We would fly out day and night to patrol around the convoys and protect them.  

'If you were lucky you would sink a submarine. But just by being there you could force submarines to submerge and not get in a position to torpedo our ships.'  

Describing the day his aircraft sank, he said: 'I flew it on a routine flight around the dock and then moored it up.  

'There was a gale during the night and it must have been holed by some floating debris and down it went. In the morning it wasn't there. Well, it was - at the bottom of the sea.'

The Mark I Sunderland flying boat was crucial to the war effort as it was deployed to tackle Nazi U-Boats in the Atlantic.

It was a military version of the Empire crafts used by Imperial Airways, with a deeper hull and turrets on the nose and tail.

Desperate to roll out the new model, the Air Ministry filed an order in 1937 to strengthen defences. The first was received in Singapore in June 1938.

By the start of the war, they had a fleet of 40, which acted as one of the major components of the UK's overseas operations for at least the first few months. In total, 75 were built.  

Initially, it carried 910kg of bombs, mines and other weaponry. A year into the war, amendments were made to combat Nazi tactics.

Two Vickers K machine guns were attached to the wing, a second gun was added to the nose turret, and constant speed propellers and de-icing boots were installed. 

The plane was discovered by a deep sea diver in 2000, after a lobster pot became snagged on its rusting remains.  

Mr Martin was brought in to identify the Sunderland, which is now surrounded by a 100m exclusion zone while the work to retrieve it continues.  

John Evans, who is running the conservation operation, said: 'Derek visited a number of times and was a tremendous support to us.  

'He piloted this plane and brought that incredible personal link with him - he would've heard the engines roar into life all those years ago.  

'Since the plane was first re-discovered around the millennium our volunteers have spent thousands of hours raising the plane in parts.  

'We have identified it as Sunderland T9044 of No 210 Squadron, RAF, which sank at its moorings in a gale in November 1940.  

'Much of it is covered in mud and sediment - which has preserved the structure and turned it into a perfect time capsule.  

'Two of its massive Pegasus radial engines and propellers have been raised from the wreck and are now being conserved and displayed in our museum.  

'To raise it all is a massive undertaking but we intend to bring up as much as we can by the 75th anniversary of its sinking in 2015.'
