A Pittsburgh takeout restaurant that serves food from countries at odds with the United States has temporarily closed following a threatening letter. 

It comes after Conflict Kitchen launched a Palestinian menu, sparking outrage in the city's Jewish community and drawing criticism from many who said America is not in conflict with Palestine.

The takeout cafe, which was designed and run by artists hoping to start conversations with customers about countries in conflict with the United States, has served food from Afghanistan, North Korea, Iran, Cuba and Venezuela from a kiosk in the city's Schenley Plaza.

'Threats': Pittsburgh police are probing threats made to Conflict Kitchen after its Palestinian menu launched

Pittsburgh police are investigating the threat against Conflict Kitchen but declined to release details. 

Public safety spokeswoman Sonya Toler said Saturday that the letter was sent to police, but she wasn't sure when it was received.

Conflict Kitchen said it would be closed until police could assess the credibility of the letter. 

It added: 'We hope to reopen shortly.'

'Promoting understanding': The restaurant claims it hopes to present a balanced view of cultures

'We have demonstrated this in the past by presenting the food, culture, and viewpoints of Iranians, Afghans, Cubans, North Koreans, and Venezuelans,' the eatery said in a blog post. 

Conflict Kitchen criticized reactions to its Palestine venture, blaming 'biased media and powerful political and lobbying groups' and said its mission is promoting understanding.

The Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh said that the restaurant only presented Palestinian viewpoints on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

A Conflict Kitchen spokesman said: 'We believe that presenting the viewpoints of Palestinians promotes understanding of Palestinians.'

The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reported that supporters used painter's tape to attach uplifting notes to the eatery Saturday.

One note read, 'Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to ... me not getting delicious food.'
