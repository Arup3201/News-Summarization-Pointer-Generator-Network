The Australian government's attempt to protect overseas relations by gagging details of an international case has backfired.

Outgoing Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has called for Australia to be 'open' and 'transparent' after details of a political case, which names current and former leaders of Asian nations, were published on whistle-blowing website Wikileaks this week.

President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has expressed his outrage at Australia's attempt to hide the investigation in which he is implicated.

'I ask that Australia issue a statement that both [former president] Megawati [Sukarnoputri] and my names are unstained, and so they do not defame other Indonesian officials. We want to hear directly from Australia,' Dr Yudhoyono urged in a press conference.

Dr Yudhoyono then wrote to his more than 5 million followers on Twitter in Indonesian: 'The Government of Australia should be completely open and make transparent its law enforcement process and not cover it up.'

Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is hiding in the Ecuadorian Embassy, has published all the details of the case on Wikileaks

The president added: 'The Government of Australia should not issue policies or statements that may raise suspicion about people who are outside Australia.'

Daily Mail Australia cannot report some of the contents of the Victorian Supreme Court case.

On Wednesday it was revealed Twitter and Google+ users may face legal action for sharing the Wikileaks publication of the court suppression order.

The anti-secrecy website published full details ofÂ  the legal suppression order issued by the Victorian Supreme Court on June 19.

Exiled Wikileaks leader Julian Assange has come out in defence of the Wikileaks publication, describing the suppression order as one of the worst of its kind 'in living memory'.

Wikileaks published the full text of the order, the contents of which Australian media organisations are legally prevented from publishing.

The court order was reportedly made to prevent damage to Australian international relations.

But Wikileaks claimed the gag order effectively blacked out the largest high-level case in Australia and the region.

From inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London, Julian Assange made a statement saying, 'the Australian government is not just gagging the Australian press it is blindfolding the Australian public'

'It is in the public interest for the press to be able to report on this case,' he said.

Mr Assange has been holed up in the embassy for two years in a bid to avoid extradition to Sweden to face sexual assault allegations.

He said Wikileaks worked to protect Australians' right to know even when the Government tried to block it.

Mr Assange criticised the move to block the public's right to know and suppress the media, especially in international cases involving politicians and subsidiaries of a public organisation.
