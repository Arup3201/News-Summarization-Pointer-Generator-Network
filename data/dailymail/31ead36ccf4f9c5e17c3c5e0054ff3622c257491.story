Former Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf ended more than four years in exile today - and immediately faced death threats from the Taliban.

The former general was whisked away by security forces after landing in Karachi despite hundreds of  supporters waiting to greet him with showers of rose petals.

The 69-year-old is hated by militants for backing America after the attacks of 11 September, 2001.

Security forces him whisked away in a 
convoy shortly after he touched down in Karachi and did not allow him to
 greet hundreds of supporters waiting at the airport, ready to shower 
him with rose petals.

He has spent the last four years in Britain and Dubai. Musharraf, who ruled Pakistan between 2001 and 2008 after seizing power in a 1999 coup, 
tweeted that he was ‘thrilled to be back home’.

He posted a picture of himself 
meeting with party workers after he landed.

Despite the threats, Musharraf tweeted that he was ‘thrilled to be back home’.

This month he announced his intention to lead his party in elections in May.

Since
 the former general was forced from power, Pakistan’s civilian 
leadership has struggled with a sinking economy, resilient Islamic 
extremist factions and tensions with Washington over drone strikes and 
the secret raid that killed Osama bin Laden.

Musharraf also faces legal charges, 
including some originating from the probe of the 2007 assassination of 
former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who also spent time in 
self-imposed exile in Dubai before returning.

The
 flight from Dubai came after several failed promises to return in 
recent years. Musharraf said in early March that he would lead his 
party, the All Pakistan Muslim League, in May elections.

The election comes as the country is struggling with rolling blackouts, rising inflation and widespread security problems.

On
 Saturday, the Pakistan Taliban released a video threatening to unleash 
suicide bombers and snipers against Musharraf if he comes back.

One of the two people speaking in the video was Adnan Rashid, a former Pakistani air force officer convicted in an attack against Musharraf.

The Taliban broke Rashid out of prison last year, along with nearly 400 other detainees.

'The mujahedeen of Islam have prepared a death squad to send Pervez Musharraf to hell,' said Rashid, who spoke in the video in front of a group of about 20 militants holding rifles.

'We warn you to surrender yourself to us. Otherwise we will hit you from where you will never reckon.'
