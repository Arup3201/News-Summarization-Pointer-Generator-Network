The surviving Doolittle Raiders, now all in their 90s, have raised a glass to their place in history for their daring World War II attack on Japan during a final ceremonial toast on Saturday to their fallen comrades.

Amind thousands of fans and a B-25 bomber flying overhead, the remaining four members opened a bottle of cognac they had been saving at the National Museum of the U.S. Airforce near Dayton, Ohio, as celebration for the 70-year anniversary of their mission.

The liquor was made in 1896, the year Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle was born.

Doolittle, who died in 1993, lead 80 men on the first US airstrike on Japan in WWII in retaliation to the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Acting Air Force Secretary Eric Fanning 
said America was at a low point, after the attack and other Axis 
successes, before 'these men who showed the nation that we were nowhere 
near defeat'.

Only four of the men are still alive and sadly today's commemoration was referred to as the last.

Museum officials estimated some 5,000 people turned out for Veterans Day weekend events honoring the 1942 mission credited with rallying American morale and throwing the Japanese off balance.

Fanning noted that all volunteered for a mission with high risks throughout, from the launch of B-25 bombers from a carrier at sea, the attack on Tokyo, and lack of fuel to reach safe bases.

The Raiders said, at the time, they didn't realize their mission would be considered an important event in turning the war's tide.

It inflicted little major damage physically, but changed Japanese strategy while firing up Americans.

'It was what you do ... over time, we've been told what effect our raid had on the war and the morale of the people,' Lt. Col. Edward Saylor, 93, said in an interview.

The Brusset, Mont. native, who now lives in Puyallup, Wash., said he was one of the lucky ones.

'There were a whole bunch of guys in World War II; a lot of people didn't come back,' he said.

Staff Sgt. David Thatcher, 92, of Missoula, Mont., said during the war, the raid seemed like 'one of many bombing missions'.

The most harrowing part for him was the crash-landing of his plane, depicted in the movie Thirty Seconds over Tokyo.

Three crew members died as Raiders bailed out or crash-landed their planes in China, but most were helped to safety by Chinese villagers and soldiers.

Three of the four surviving Raiders were greeted by flag-waving well-wishers ranging from small children to fellow war veterans.

The fourth couldn't travel because of health problems.

Twelve-year-old Joseph John Castellano's grandparents brought him from their Dayton home for Saturday's events.

'This was Tokyo. The odds of their survival were 1 in a million,' the boy said.

'I just felt like I owe them a few short hours of the thousands of hours I will be on Earth.'

More than 600 people, including Raiders widows and children, descendants of Chinese villagers who helped them, and Pearl Harbor survivors, were expected for the invitation-only ceremony Saturday evening.

After Thomas Griffin of Cincinnati died in February at age 96, the survivors decided at the 71st anniversary reunion in April in Fort Walton, Beach, Fla., that it would be their last and that they would gather this autumn for one last toast together instead of waiting, as had been the original plan, for the last two survivors to make the toast.

'We didn't want to get a city all excited and plan and get everything set up for a reunion, and end up with no people because of our age,' explained Lt. Col. Richard Cole, the oldest survivor at 98.

The Dayton native, who was Doolittle's co-pilot, lives in Comfort, Texas.

Lt. Col. Robert Hite, 93, couldn't come.

Son Wallace Hite said his father, wearing a Raiders blazer and other traditional garb for their reunions, made his own salute to the fallen with a silver goblet of wine at home in Nashville, Tenn., earlier in the week.

Hite is the last survivor of eight Raiders who were captured by Japanese soldiers.

Three were executed; another died in captivity.

The 80 silver goblets in the ceremony were presented to the Raiders in 1959 by the city of Tucson, Ariz.

Honored: Gen. James H. Doolittle in 1975. He led airmen on a daring raid on Japan during World War II

Celebration time: Silver cups with the names of the Doolittle Raiders with a bottle of cognac at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton. The cognac is from 1896, the year Doolittle was born.

The Raiders' names are engraved twice, the second upside-down. During the ceremony, white-gloved cadets pour cognac into the participants' goblets.

Those of the deceased are turned upside-down.

The cognac is from 1896, the year Doolittle was born.
