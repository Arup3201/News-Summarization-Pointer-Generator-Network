World Cup 2018 hosts Russia have been accused of destroying computers and emails in  FIFA's investigation into the bidding process.

The Russians beat England to host the tournament in four years' time but football's world governing body called them 'highly unco-operative' in a 42-page report published on Thursday morning.

Russia 'made only a limited amount of documents available' to FIFA investigator Michael Garcia, which they explained away by saying the computers used during the bid were leased and then returned to the owner and subsequently destroyed, allegedly along with any email trails.

Russia were cleared of wrongdoing by judge Hans-Joachim Erckert on Thursday morning - before Garcia appealed against that interpretation - and the chief of Russia's 2018 World Cup organising committee, Alexey Sorokin, insists the country has nothing to hide.

'We were always confident that there could be nothing which would come out from this investigation,' he told Sky Sports News. 'It's something FIFA deemed important to do. We complied, what more can we do?'

He added: 'There were no deleted emails. We rented the equipment, we had to give it back then it went - we don't even know where it went - to some sports schools so quite naturally other people used it.'

Speaking before Garcia’s protest against the report summary, Russia’s sports minister Vitaly Mutko said: “I was sure that this is what would happen – our bidding campaign was absolutely honest. We didn’t play any games behind the scenes. I’m glad that this matter has finally been put to rest.” 

When asked about the Russians failing to provide emails, FA chairman Greg Dyke said: 'Those who co-operated the most seemed to be the ones that gave them the information by which they were then criticised, like the FA. 

'Others, who didn't co-operate, didn't get criticised at all. Well, there's a surprise.'
