It was a one-of-a-kind First World War prototype fighter plane, armed with a 45 horsepower engine, a 20-foot wingspan and a Lewis gun.

Now, the Port Victoria P.V.8 Eastchurch Kitten has been brought back to life - 100 years after the war began.

But while the replica has been built using an original wooden frame, it also includes recycled materials, such as the engine of a Citroen 2CV.

Around 60 volunteers helped to restore the plane to its former glory at the Yorkshire Air Museum - working from only two photographs and faded A3 plans.

They created the replica using a wooden frame covered in linen, as well as specifically-made materials, such as the engine cowlings, and recycled materials, including the 500cc Citroen engine.

Ian Reed, manager at the museum in Elvington, York, said the £10,000 restoration project had been 'very exciting'.

'This is the only plane of its kind in existence. It would have disappeared from history if we hadn't brought it back to life with this project,' he said.

Prototype: The Eastchurch Kitten, featuring a 45 horsepower engine, made its first flight in September 1917

Fighter plane: It was designed as a 'high altitude' fighter to tackle the threat posed by the Zeppelin Airships. However, the one-seater aircraft was eventually deemed too fragile and underpowered to enter production

'It's been quite tricky as we've been working from faded plans so it's important that we've got people with specific knowledge.

'It's also been a very interesting build because it's so tiny, with a six-metre wingspan and measuring five metres in length.

'I'm glad we've got it finished in time for the centenary.' 

The Eastchurch Kitten, which made its first flight on September 1, 1917, was designed by the Port Victoria Marine Experimental Aircraft Depot on the Isle of Grain.

Established by the British Royal Naval Air Service in 1915, the Depot created and tested a range of experimental aircraft - not all of which were flown.

Featuring a 45 horsepower engine, the
 Eastchurch Kitten was designed as a 'high altitude' fighter to tackle 
the threat posed by the Zeppelin Airships.

It was planned to be launched from platforms on battleships, cruisers of even torpedo boats.

However, the aircraft was eventually deemed too fragile and underpowered to enter production. 

The framework of the replica was crafted in the 1980s, before being abandoned and taken up again four years ago.

To create it, volunteers sourced the twin-opposed Citroen 2CV engine, which features similar twin-opposed cylinders.

They then stripped these down to make the equipment light, before removing any 'unnecessary' parts, such as the cooling fans and starter motor.

They also managed to acquire a propellor from one of the museum's local flying clubs.

However, many of the aircraft's parts had to be specially crafted, such as the cowlings covering the engine, which have to be made out of spinning aluminum.

Instruments
 inside the cockpit were acquired from the national collection archives,
 while the seating and padding around the controls were made with 
leather.

A Lewis gun, mounted on to the top wing of the aircraft, was also designed to measure.

Four years' work: The replica will be a non-flying exhibit as part of the museum's Thunder Day shows on April 6

Mr Reed said: 'The Eastchurch Kitten was to be a disposable, one-operation aircraft - to simply go up, intercept and shoot down the airship, then ditch in the sea.

'When you work on it, you think this must have been quite a frightening prospect. Somebody had to get into this tiny aircraft and get up to ten or 15,000 feet with such a small engine, shoot at the huge airship, then crash into the sea and get out as soon as they could.

'But there were people willing to do it - some very gutsy people.'

The replica will be a non-flying exhibit as part of the museum's Thunder Day engine running shows on April 6.
