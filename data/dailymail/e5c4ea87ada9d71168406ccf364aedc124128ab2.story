Jose Mourinho has criticised the tactical ineffectiveness of Roy Hodgson and Vicente Del Bosque at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

Hodgson's England and Del Bosque's Spain both crashed out in the group stages, and Mourinho admitted that he could not understand the manager's decisions when losing matches.

Speaking to Alastair Campbell for his new book 'Winners: And How They Succeed', the Chelsea boss said of England:

Roy Hodgson looks on, hands on hips, as England struggle at the Brazil World Cup in June 2014

Luis Suarez scored twice for Uruguay to resign England to defeat in Sao Paolo in their second Group D match

Suarez spreads his arms in celebration - and Mourinho admits he would have treated the game differently

'They are losing [to Uruguay in their second group match] and, if they lose, they are out of the tournament, so they have to score. They made two changes at 1-0 down. But when Roy Hodgson made these changes — [Raheem] Sterling out, [Ross] Barkley in, then [Adam] Lallana in for [Danny] Welbeck — I couldn't see a strategic change. Same tactical model, same system.' 

'You are losing 1-0, you need to get a draw at least, so I say take one defender off and play three at the back, put an extra man to midfield/attack.

'So maybe take off [Leighton] Baines and play [Gary] Cahill sweeper, [Glen] Johnson and [Phil] Jagielka marking one each, an extra man to midfield or attack. Then Uruguay have to adapt.'

Some England fans felt the same as Mourinho - that Hodgson hadn't done enough tactically

Mourinho also stuck the boot in to Vicente Del Bosque - the Spain manager who also saw his side crash out

Mourinho's in-depth analysis of England will haunt fans who wanted him in charge in 2007, when he came close to accepting the role before his wife told him to turn it down 'because he'd be bored'. 

The now-Chelsea manager, who has guided his team to top of the Premier League, then turned his attentions away from analysing England, instead focusing on Spain, whose  World Cup exploits were equally as bad as the Three Lions - if not worse.

'They [Spain] are losing — so Diego Costa out, Fernando Torres in. Why? Play them together. You need to change. They will say, "Ah, but Spain has its own system, its own philosophy" — hell, if it is not working, you change.'
