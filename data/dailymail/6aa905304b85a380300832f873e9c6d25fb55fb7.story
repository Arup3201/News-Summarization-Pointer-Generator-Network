You should never tempt fate in football but Manchester City did just that and were left red-faced ahead of their 1-1 draw with Roma in the Champions League on Tuesday night.

City's official Twitter feed light-heartedly tweeted their Italian counterparts ahead of kick-off saying: 'We're looking forward to hosting you Roma, and legendary player such as Totti. He's never scored in England, has he?'

The Serie A side replied: 'You're right Man City, our Capitano has never scored in England. But there's always a first time for everything...'

Man City foolishly tempted fate  by jokingly asking Roma whether Totti had scored in England before

Roma subsequently had the last laugh when, with 23 minutes on the clock, their captain raced through to coolly chip the ball over the onrushing Joe Hart. 

Finding the net for the first time on English soil, Totti became the oldest goalscorer in Champions League history at the age of 38 years and three days - beating the record previously held by Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs.

After Tuesday night's Twitter gaffe, it's unlikely City will be in a rush to tweet their Italian counterparts, Bayern Munich and CSKA Moscow ahead of the club's remaining Group E fixtures.
