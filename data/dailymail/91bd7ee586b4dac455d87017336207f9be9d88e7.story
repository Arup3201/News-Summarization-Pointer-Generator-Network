Doctor Clare Holdsworth, 43 was sentenced to a 12-month community order and 200 hours unpaid work for being four times over the limit behind the wheel

A drink-driving doctor who was four times over the limit was
shopped to police by her concerned partner when she took an early morning drive
to buy more alcohol, magistrates' heard today.

Disgraced consultant anaesthetist Clare Holdsworth, 44, was
stopped by police only yards from her house in October last year.

Officers had been alerted by her long-term partner who
called 999 to warn them Holdsworth was drunk and had taken his car, which she
was not insured to drive.

After being stopped near her home in Halifax, West Yorks,
the court heard that she refused to give a breath test and kept telling
officers ‘will you just let me go home’.

Calderdale Magistrates’ Court heard instead of getting out
of the car she reached for a bottle of vodka mix. Officers then spotted a bag
containing cans and bottles in the footwell.

Holdsworth then screamed at the officers as they tried
handcuff her.

When she was finally tested her breath recorded 135mg of
alcohol in 100mls of breath, the legal limit being 35mg.

Malcolm Nowell, Holdsworth’s solicitor, told the court that
she no longer works for the health authority, and is on employment benefits of
70 pounds a week, but now ‘devoted her energies to work with people who have
similar illnesses’.

The former consultant was handed a 12-month community order
with 200 hours of unpaid work after magistrates' heard she had been attending AA
meetings and a support group.

The court previously heard that Holdsworth, who worked as a
consultant anaesthetist in Calderdale and Huddersfield since 2005, has been
suspended since December 2010 after she admitted to her manager she had once
had a drink on duty.

Speaking at that earlier hearing, Mr Nowell said: ‘She has
always been able to cope with the demands of the job and thought she had a good
relationship with her boss.

‘She mentioned the difficulties she was having and that on
one occasion she had had a drink while on duty.

‘She thought that would be met with some sympathy and
understanding, but she was reported to the GMC.’

He added: ‘She had drunk a significant amount on the night
before the offence. She was stopped because her partner called the police, because
he was concerned for her and for the public.

Holdsworth was also disqualified from driving for 32 months
and will have to pay 85 pounds in costs.

Speaking after the sentence Holdsworth said: ‘I don’t really
have anything to say. I’m perfectly happy with the sentence.’

Mr Nowell told the court today that Holdsworth, who admitted
driving while over the limit and driving without insurance, had made great improvements
with her alcohol problem.
