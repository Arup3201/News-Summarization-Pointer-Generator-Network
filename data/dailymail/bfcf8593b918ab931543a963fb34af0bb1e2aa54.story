Gordon Ramsay has suffered his own Kitchen Nightmare after being ditched by his flagship restaurant in Canada after just six months.

The celebrity chef has been accused of being ‘too busy’ to meet his obligations to the Laurier Gordon Ramsay in Montreal.

He reportedly ‘just didn’t get’ their vision and has not been seen at the restaurant since August.

Gordon Ramsay is suing his former flagship restaurant in Canada for £1.7million

Danny Lavy, the owner of the 75-year-old rotisserie, has revealed that he is counter-suing Ramsay in a U.S. court over a separate matter.

After his meteoric rise to fame, it's been a difficult few years for TV chef Gordon Ramsey.

He reportedly paid his father-in-law £2million to end a long-running 
row over his business.The pair went their separate way 
after Ramsay accused Chris Hutcheson of taking money out of parent company 
Gordon Ramsay Holdings (GRH).

He was even seen in an awkward QVC pitch, as he tried to sell the 'Nonstick Hard Anodized Dishwasher Safe 10-piece Cookware Set'.

Ramsay's fiscal situation hasn't been as healthy as it once was in the last few years, after he paid off a a tax debt in 2009 relating to his Plane Food restaurant at Heathrow’s Terminal 5.

The father-of-four recently closed two eateries in Australia, waving goodbye to Maze and Maze Grill in Melbourne’s Crown Metropol Hotel.

Further troubles include a £1.1million court battle in New Zealand after pulling out of a number of charity engagements, citing personal reasons

Even wife Tana tried to help pocket some cash after agreeing to star on the fifth series of British Dancing On Ice, but soap star Hayley Tamaddon triumphed as the winner.

In 2008, Sarah Symonds claimed she had an affair with Ramsay after after they met in a London nightclub, and he told her that her his marriage was in trouble.

In an ironic echo of his TV series, 
the Laurier owners also claimed he Ramsay was clueless about food their 
diners wanted and tried to axe popular dishes.

Danny
 Lavy, the owner of the 75-year-old rotisserie, said that he has ended 
the contract and is in the process of taking down the words ‘Gordon 
Ramsay’ from the sign outside the building.

It will also be removed from any branded material as well.

Mr Lavy said: ‘We wish Gordon all the best, but he’s a big star and too busy to come to the restaurant.

‘Are we disappointed in his lack of participation? Totally. I expected more. He just didn’t get it.’

The new venture opened to much fanfare last August with a party for 600 VIPs, but things went wrong soon after.

Mr
 Lavy said that Ramsay ended up being a consultant instead of a partner 
and that his team began ‘acting as if they owned’ the restaurant.

The question of ‘vision’ soon became a major issue too when Ramsay insisted dishes like salmon tartare be removed.

Mr
 Lavy insisted it stayed and it has now become one of their best 
sellers. Ramsay also failed to create his own spectacular dishes and 
instead tweaked what was already there.

Then there was the fact that Ramsay was never around leading to awkward questions from diners.

Mr Lavy told the Montreal Gazette: ‘This is a local restaurant with a lot of heritage.

‘We want to respect the clientele and deliver what they want when they come here.

‘We got to the point of not being on the same page and having someone taking a direction we didn't want to take. 

‘He didn't understand what was important to us. He was the one who originally wanted to get rid of the original staff.’

With cookbooks, TV shows and dozens of restaurants around the world, Ramsay has repeatedly faced accusations he has spread himself too thin.

He recently paid his in-laws a reported £2million to end a long-running row over his business and has been sued for failing to turn up to a charity fundraiser.

A spokesman for Ramsay said he was ‘disappointed’ by Mr Lavy's comments and that the chef had provided ‘significant’ support to the restaurant.
