An obese woman left devastated when doctors said she was infertile has defied the odds by losing half her body weight - and giving birth to a baby boy.

Cassie Collings, 24, went to the doctors after years of trying for a baby, suspecting her 24 stone body was the reason she couldn't conceive.

Despite years of dieting she was unable to shift the excess weight, and  ballooned to a size 26.

But tests revealed she was suffering with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which causes weight gain and fertility problems. 

Cassie Collings, 24, was devastated to be told she was infertile due to polycystic ovary syndrome and obesity. But after losing half her body weight she fell pregnant and gave birth to son Harvey in October 2013

After undergoing gastric bypass surgery in July 2012, Mrs Collings, who works in a bingo hall, lost an incredible 12 stone - half her body weight - in just six months.

Desperate to be a mother, she signed up for IVF treatment immediately, even though doctors said it would be risky so soon after her operation.

She was stuneed when she fell pregnant naturally in February 2013, and gave birth to her 'miracle' son Harvey in October.

Mrs Collings, from Redcar, North Yorkshire, said: 'I went to my GP initially because I was concerned that I hadn't fallen pregnant.

'He ordered a scan and sat me down to tell me I had polycystic ovaries and was infertile.

'I was devastated. When I asked what I could do he suggested IVF, but said I wouldn't be eligible because I was so fat.

'I was a vicious circle. I couldn't lose weight because of my condition, but I couldn't have treatment because I was fat.

Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common condition affecting millions of women in the UK.

The three main features are:

Polycystic ovaries contain a large number of harmless cysts, up to 8" in size.

They are under-developed sacs in which eggs develop.

Often in PCOS, these sacs are unable to release an egg, meaning ovulation does not take place.

It is estimated one in five women in the UK have the condition.

Symptoms include:

The condition is linked with an increased risk of other problems later in life, including type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol levels.

PCOS is associated with abnormal hormone levels in the body, including high levels of insulin.

There is no cure, but it can be treated.

Losing weight and maintaining a healthy diet can help reduce some symptoms.

Medications can also help combat hair growth, irregular periods and fertility problems.

'I tried slimming tablets and they didn't work.

'I tried everything and finally I was recommended for surgery.

'I went to a seminar about the options and chose to book for a gastric bypass.' 

Mrs Collings underwent surgery in June 2012 at the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesborough.

She lost a massive two-and-a-half stone in the first month and by the beginning of 2013 she had dropped a stunning 12 stone - half her body weight.

Prior to surgery doctors warned Mrs Collings that she couldn't go for IVF for two years following the operation as it would put her at high risk of miscarriage or further complications.

But shockingly she fell pregnant naturally in February 2013 - just seven months after her operation.

She was taken into hospital and monitored three times a week throughout her pregnancy.

She said: 'When I found out I was pregnant I was so happy and excited but at the same time worried sick.

'The doctors said that of all the women who had fallen pregnant after having the surgery at the hospital, none of the babies had survived.

'I was told to expect the worst and put on consultant-led care.

'I was in hospital at least three times a week and constantly scared I would lose my baby.

'Each week I got past was a miracle.'

In order to force herself to eat, she would set an alarm every hour, waking up to eat tiny portions including a handful of peanuts or a bite of toast.

On October 24 2013, at 38 weeks, Mrs Collings went into labour. 

 After six hours, son Harvey was born weighing a healthy 7lb 10oz.

She said: 'Holding Harvey made everything I went through worth it.

'He was our miracle baby we never thought we would have. He beat all the odds.' 

Mrs Collings was advised not to go for IVF treatment for two years after her gastric bypass operation she risked miscarriage. She was stunned to fall pregnant naturally in February 2013. Here, she is pictured with her father before the weight loss
