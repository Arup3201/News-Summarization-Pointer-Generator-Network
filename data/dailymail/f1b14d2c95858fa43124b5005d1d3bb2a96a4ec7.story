Hatem Ben Arfa has reached an agreement with Newcastle to have his contract terminated with immediate effect.

The winger was sent to Hull on a season-long loan last summer but Tigers boss Steve Bruce cut his spell at the KC Stadium short after becoming frustrated with the Frenchman's attitude.

Ben Arfa's Newcastle contract was due to expire at the end of this season but he has agreed for it to be torn up in order to secure a permanent move to Ligue 1 side Nice.

French international Hatem Ben Arfa has agreed a deal with French club Nice after leaving Hull early

The 27-year-old's loan spell is being cut short by Hull having played just nine games for the club

A Newcastle statement read: 'Newcastle United can today confirm that Hatem Ben Arfa and the club have reached an agreement to terminate the contract between both parties with immediate effect by mutual consent. Newcastle United wishes Hatem all the best for his future.' 

The announcement follows confirmation from Nice that they are set to hand the 27-year-old a chance to get his career back on track. 

A statement on Nice's website on Saturday read: 'Nice confirms having reached an agreement in principle with Hatem Ben Arfa. The French international will pass the medical examination Monday, prior to his signature.

'Hatem Ben Arfa has never been so close to Nice. The attacking midfielder is expected to continue his career in the red-and-black jersey.'

Ben Arfa was pictured training with his new team-mates on Saturday and is due to sign a contract on Monday.

He made just eight Premier League appearances for Hull before Bruce dropped him, with the former Sunderland boss telling the BBC: 'Sometimes transfers don't work, especially with a loan deal. 

Ben Arfa scored 14 goals in 86 appearances for Newcastle but is surplus to requirements at St James' Park

'I'm disappointed. We brought him in on a wave of publicity and there has been no fallout or slanging match.

'His views of the game are different to mine. At any club you need to have a certain work ethic to get in the team, that's the frustrating thing.' 

Ben Arfa netted 14 goals in 86 games for Newcastle before departing for Hull but former Magpies manager Alan Pardew made it clear that he would not be welcome back at St James' Park.

'He won't be coming back here, that's all I can say,' said Pardew.
