Cameroon's football federation is to investigate claims players in its national team conspired to deliberately lose their World Cup games in Brazil.

Despite fielding a team of world-class footballers, the Indomitable Lions failed to win a single one of their group A matches. Their failures included a humiliating 4-0 loss to Croatia.

The investigation comes after a report in Der Spiegel in which convicted fraudster Wilson Raj Perumal accurately forecast that loss and that a player would be sent off during the match.

Firing line: The Cameroon federation will investigate claims of match-fixing among their squad

Pointless: The African side finished bottom of Group A having lost all three games

Midfielder Alex Song - who plays for 
Spanish team Barcelona - was sent off before halftime for an elbow in 
the back of Croatia's Mario Mandzukic, leaving his side a man down for 
most of the game.

The Fédération Camerounaise de 
Football (Fecafoot) says it has instructed its ethics committee to probe
 allegations of what it described as 'fraud' in their three games in 
Brazil.

The Fecafoot statement read: 'Recent 
allegations of fraud around Cameroon 2014 FIFA World Cup three 
preliminary games, especially Cameroon vs. Croatia, as well of the 
"existence of seven bad apples [in our national team]" do not reflect 
the values and principles promoted by our administration, in line with 
FIFA Code of Conduct and the ethics of our nation.

'We
 wish to inform the general public that, though not yet contacted by 
FIFA in regards to this affair, our administration has already 
instructed its Ethics Committee, to further investigate these 
accusations.

'We are strongly committed to employ all means necessary to resolve this disruptive matter in the shortest delays.

'In
 the meantime we legitimately request that any related information, 
unless brought before our federation and/or its Ethics Committee, be 
held for or treated as mere assumption.

'We
 wish to reinstate that in fifty-five (55) years of existence, Fecafoot
has never been sanctioned for, involved in, or even linked to match 
fixing or any fraud of any kind.'

Rout: Cameroon imploded against Croatia in Manaus and fell to a 4-0 defeat

Clash: Benjamin Moukandjo and Benoit Assou-Ekotto needed to be separated after confronting each other

The
 Cameroon-Croatia clash was also marred by an incident near the end when
 Benoit Assou-Ekotto attempted to head-butt team mate Benjamin 
Moukandjo.

Cameroon's 
federation subsequently launched an investigation into the incident but 
has yet to give any update on possible disciplinary action.

Cameroon headed home after losing against Brazil and Mexico, as well as Croatia, to finish bottom of Group A.

The latest controversy adds to a long list for African teams at the World Cup.

Both Ghana and Nigeria, now out of the tournament, were embroiled in disputes over money in Brazil.

Ghana
 had two players sent home, Sulley Muntari for hitting an official and 
Kevin-Prince Boateng for allegedly swearing at the coach.

However, in some respects it was a success. Both Nigeria and Algeria made it to the knockout stages, the first time the continent has had two teams make it past the group stages in the same tournament.
