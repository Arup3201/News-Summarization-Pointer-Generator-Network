Bayern Munich will not stockpile young players just to send them out loan like Chelsea, claims technical director Michael Reschke. 

Chelsea have sent 30 players out on loan this season and last season allowed big-name young players such as Romelu Lukaku and Kevin De Bruyne to leave Stamford Bridge to gain first team football before eventually selling them. 

Earlier this month they had also hoped to sign 23-year-old Andrej Kramaric from HNK Rijeka and then loan him to Leicester before the deal fell through and the Croatian signed for Nigel Pearson's side instead.

Such a policy has seen Jose Mourinho's side criticised and Reschke insists Bayern - who have three promising players, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Jan Kirchhoff and Julian Green, on loan - do not operate in the same way.  

'Sending players out on loan is not part of our philosophy. It's a decision we make case by case,' he told SID. 

'We always make a well-considered decision what's best for a certain young player in his situation. 

'For example, a temporary spell with Augsburg is a great solution for Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg but there's no policy or clear philosophy behind it like at Chelsea.

'There are a number of paths that could help a player reach his goals. [Bayer Leverkusen midfielder] Christoph Kramer needed his loan [at Borussia Monchengladbach]. Marco Reus needed to develop at Borussia Dortmund, Ahlen, Gladbach and then Dortmund again.

'At Bayern, Philipp Lahm needed some time at Stuttgart...'

As well as Hojbjerg, Bayern have Kirchhoff on loan at Schalke and and Green at Hamburg.
