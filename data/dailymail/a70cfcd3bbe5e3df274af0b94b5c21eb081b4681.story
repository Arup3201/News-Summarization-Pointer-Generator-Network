Frank Lampard could yet choose to leave Manchester City this month.

The 36-year-old started against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday but has grown frustrated at his general lack of game time. 

City have been impressed with Lampard and his contribution on and off the pitch during his loan spell and his presence proved vital in the absence of Yaya Toure during the Africa Cup of Nations.

Lampard could join MLS side New York City FC earlier than he had planned in order to get first-team football

The former England international was ready to join up with City's MLS franchise in New York but was convinced by City's hierarchy that he had a vital role to play in their bid to retain the Premier League title and catch pacesetters Chelsea, his former club.

Lampard has made 30 appearances this season but many of those have been 10 minute cameos and his main objective remains to play. He has been encouraged by New York's start to the MLS season and is drawn to joining up with their project sooner rather than at the end of the season. The MLS transfer window remains open until May.

City have a big squad to utilise and just eight Premier League games left without the FA Cup or European football to contend with.
