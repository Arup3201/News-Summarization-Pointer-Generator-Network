Paul Lambert has warned Swansea there is much more to come from Christian Benteke as he continues to improve following his recovery from long-term injury.

Benteke scored a wonderful goal against Manchester United to earn Aston Villa a point, building on a brilliant solo strike that won Lambert’s side the game at Crystal Palace.

The Belgian striker was out for six months with a ruptured Achilles but is beginning to look something of his old self.

‘He is getting there, I still think there is much more to come from him,’ said Lambert, who takes his team to the Liberty Stadium on Boxing Day. ‘His goal was world class on Saturday. There’s a top player in him when he's really on his game.

'He's an absolute handful. If he keeps doing what he's doing and keeps his feet on the ground and works hard let's see what his career does.’

Villa are trying to alter their playing style by bringing the ball out from the back and controlling possession – and pass-masters Swansea present an intriguing test.

‘There have been mistakes but, no problem,’ said Lambert. ‘I don't mind if they make a bad pass or give it away - keep doing it, don't hide form the ball. Always try to dominate the ball.’
