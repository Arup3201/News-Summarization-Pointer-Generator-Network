Veteran BBC broadcaster Paul Gambaccini last night admitted he is the latest celebrity to be arrested by detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile scandal.

The 64-year-old radio and TV presenter – who last year described Savile as ‘not all good, not all bad’ – broke his silence three days after he was held on suspicion of sexual offences by officers working on Scotland Yard’s Operation Yewtree.

He issued a statement denying the ‘historic’ allegations of sexual abuse after frenzied speculation about the identity of the high-profile suspect arrested earlier this week.

The awards came two days after it was revealed broadcaster Paul Gambaccini, pictured, had been arrested on suspicion of sexual offences under Operation Yewtree. He issued a statement denying the 'historic' allegations

Both the BBC and Scotland Yard had 
repeatedly refused to confirm that Gambaccini had been detained at his 
home in the South Bank area of London early on Tuesday.

Gambaccini
 said last night: ‘On Monday night, 28 October, I attended an excellent 
production of the Kander and Ebb  musical, the Scottsboro Boys, at the 
Young Vic theatre.

‘It 
concerned a group of black men in Alabama in the 1930s who were falsely 
accused of sexual offences. Within hours, I was arrested by Operation 
Yewtree. Nothing had changed, except this time there was no music.’

A
 spokesman for the gay presenter said: ‘Mr Gambaccini was interviewed by
 Operation Yewtree officers about historic allegations. He answered 
their questions and was co-operative. He denied all allegations.’

Paul Gambaccini was questioned by detectives for several hours before being released late on Tuesday

The
 star’s regular show due to air at 8pm tonight on Radio 2 was last night
 hurriedly cancelled, and replaced by a repeat of ‘Johnnie Walker Meets 
Art Garfunkel’.

A BBC 
spokesperson said: ‘Paul Gambaccini has decided that, in light of 
today’s media attention, he would rather not be on-air at present and we
 respect that decision.

‘Therefore,
 Paul will not be presenting on BBC Radio in [the] coming weeks and 
replacement programmes for the period will be announced soon.’

Operation
 Yewtree is the national investigation prompted after claims were made 
against disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Savile.

Scotland Yard has led the 
probe, and separated its inquiries into those involving Savile, those 
involving Savile and others, and those involving others.

Detectives
 did not disclose details of the allegations facing Gambaccini. But it 
indicated in a statement that he is not suspected of committing offences
 with paedophile Savile.

Radio
 2 DJ Gambaccini, dubbed the ‘Professor of Pop’ because of his extensive
 knowledge of music, was questioned by detectives for several hours 
before being released late on Tuesday.

Following
 his arrest, the normally media-friendly DJ was holed up at his 
£1.3million penthouse flat near Waterloo Bridge for three days, 
declining to return calls or reply to email requests for a statement 
from journalists.

The BBC initially referred all questions about his arrest to Scotland Yard, saying it ‘would not be commenting on speculation’.

Gambaccini’s
 silence was in sharp contrast to when the Savile scandal erupted last 
autumn. Then, the popular pundit happily gave a series of interviews 
about the disgraced Jim’ll Fix It star.

Oxford-educated
 Gambaccini, who has been at the BBC for 40 years, was criticised when 
he revealed he knew about sexual abuse by Savile but failed to report 
it.

At the time, he said: 
‘So what, I a junior DJ am supposed to get up there and say my senior is
 a perv? They are going to laugh at me. It never occurred to me.’

He
 added: ‘Jimmy Savile had an imperial personality in showbusiness. You 
just didn’t mess with Jim – you let him have his turf.’

Gambaccini
 was the 15th suspect to be arrested under Operation Yewtree. Police 
confirmed another man, aged 74, was arrested as part of the 
investigation.

His identity was not clear last night.

Both men have been bailed to a date in early January.

He was nicknamed ‘Professor of Pop’ thanks to his encyclopaedic knowledge of music.

And Paul Gambaccini has become a major figure at  the BBC despite, according  to him, homophobic discrimination.

Earlier this year the American claimed in a newspaper interview that his personnel file at the corporation was marked with a drawing of a Christmas tree to indicate he was ‘as camp as Christmas’.

He said managers feared he would be a ‘security risk’ because of his sexuality.

Born in New York, he gained British citizenship in 2005, and now has dual US-British nationality.

He began his career at the BBC in 1973 as a reporter on John Peel’s Radio 1 show, Rockspeak.Gambaccini went on to be a Radio 1 presenter for 16 years and hosts Radio 4 music quiz Counterpoint.

He has been a film critic  on breakfast TV, presented on Classic FM and written 15 books.

Alongside his work in music radio, he has contributed regularly to BBC Radio 4’s long-running arts programme Kaleidoscope.

Gambaccini’s long career in broadcasting was recognised when he was inducted into the Radio Academy Hall of Fame in 2005.

The presenter entered into a civil partnership with his actor and model boyfriend Christopher Sherwood last year. Gambaccini was renowned for his broad knowledge of rock history.

But he was also unusually well educated for a pop DJ, having read Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Oxford University, as well as studying at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, in the US.

He was spotted by the BBC in the 1970s when he was working as Rolling Stone music magazine’s UK correspondent and produced an impressive interview with Elton John.

Gambaccini has said that his proudest achievements are the length of his career, and having co-hosted Live Aid.

Aside from his love of music, the presenter is also a comic book fan and once co-owned a shop, Top 10 Comics, with fellow presenter Jonathan Ross. It is now closed.
