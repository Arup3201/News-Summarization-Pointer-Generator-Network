Google has been shamed into donating £1million to the fight against internet child abuse images following the revelation that it had previously only given the equivalent of 90 seconds’ profit to the cause.

The internet giant announced that it would give the money over the next four years to the Internet Watch Foundation, a charity which seeks to police illegal images online.

The money will enable the Cambridge-based watchdog to more than double its number of staff to nine full-time ‘internet content analysts’ and one part-time.

Google's £1million donation to to the fight against internet child abuse images was welcomed by the government as a 'first step' to tackling the problem

Google acted after the revelation last
 week that, despite making great play of its support for the IWF, it 
donated just £20,000 a year. Its new donation is worth £250,000 a year -
 more than ten times as much.

Critics last night said that though 
the larger amount was welcome, it was still a drop in the ocean compared
 to the firm’s UK profits - and was nothing when set alongside the huge 
amounts of tax it was dodging. In 2011, Google paid just £6million in 
corporation tax, despite sales worth £3.2billion.

Tonight the government welcomed the donation - but said it was only ‘a first step’.

The donation emerged as Labour held a 
debate in the Commons, urging the government to take tougher action to 
protect children from accessing porn online, and to help crack down on 
the child abuse images on the net.

They called on ministers to bring in 
new laws to ‘set a timetable for the introduction of safe search as a 
default’ setting for internet search engines, effective age verification
 checks on pornographic sites, and ‘splash page warnings’, which will 
flash a warning that a web surfer is about to visit a child porn site.

Conservative MPs refused to support 
the motion and it was defeated by more than 50 votes. But culture 
minister Ed Vaizey did say that if internet firms failed to act, 
legislation could follow.

During the debate, Anne Coffey, Labour
 MP for Stockport, criticised Google for its failure to take decent 
action to protect children.

‘Google is one of the biggest hosts of
 child sexual abuse images, albeit inadvertently, and it should 
therefore accept the major responsibility for proactively monitoring and
 removing those images,’ she told MPs.

‘If Google spent as much money on 
monitoring and removing illegal child sexual abuse images as it does on 
paying accountants to avoid tax in the UK, it might go some way towards 
living up to its motto, “Don’t be evil”?’

Google had previously donated just £20,000 to the charity - equivalent to 90 seconds' profit

Web companies are under increased 
scrutiny following the conviction of Mark Bridger, who was jailed for 
life for the murder of five-year-old April Jones.

He had collected a 
‘library’ of sickening images by searching for simple terms on Google 
and Bing in the weeks before the abduction.

Both he and Stuart Hazell, who 
murdered 12-year-old Tia Sharp, had no previous convictions for sexual 
offences and progressed from viewing child porn on the internet to 
committing child murder.

The Internet Watch Foundation has been
 under increasing pressure in recent years. Last year, reports of child 
abuse sites soared by 40 per cent compared with the year before, to 
40,000 - or 150 a day.

Chief executive Susie Hargreaves 
welcomed the extra money, which she said was almost the equivalent of a 
whole year’s running costs for the IWF.

‘This is an incredibly generous donation and Google is demonstrating moral leadership in the field,’ she said.

‘This contribution will significantly 
boost our work to meet our vision eliminating online child sexual abuse 
content. We are experts at doing this and like any organisation we can 
do more, with more resource’.

Scott Rubin, of Google, said: ‘We have
 a zero-tolerance policy on child sexual abuse content. The IWF are 
essential partners in our fight to rid the Internet of this illegal 
material by providing us with lists of web pages that we block from 
search results.’

A spokesman for the Department of 
Culture, Media and Sport said: ‘It’s good news Google have responded to 
next week’s summit so positively by donating £1million to the Internet 
Watch Foundation, but it’s just a first step.

‘Parents are rightly worried about 
what their children have access to online and given the proliferation of
 child abuse imagery, we need a committed emphasis on tackling the 
problem.’

John Carr, from the Children’s 
Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety, said: ‘This is a fantastic 
gesture by Google, and it has got to be applauded. Other companies such 
as Facebook should pick up the gauntlet that they have thrown down.’
