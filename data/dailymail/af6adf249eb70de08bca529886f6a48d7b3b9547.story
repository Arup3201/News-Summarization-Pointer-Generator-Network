These realistic, giant animal sculptures are created entirely from reclaimed driftwood.

Using salvaged tree branches, sticks and roots found on the Washington coastline, artist Jeffro Uitto can fashion anything from huge wooden animals to intricate home furniture.

Each sculpture can take years to create and finding the right piece for each project can take months at a time.

Jeffro's love for creating art from 
salvaged driftwood began at an early age and he now runs his own shop in
 Tokeland, Washington, USA.

His incredible artwork has become so 
popular that he is inundated with requests to travel and make bespoke 
pieces on site.

Jeffro said: 'I've always loved 
working with wood. I love using such beautiful, natural shapes and 
giving them a new lease of life.'

Recycled: The artist makes sure all the driftwood he finds get a second lease of life

'I have many different spots where I 
am able to hunt for material and I find most of my pieces in the winter,
 when storms are moving the wood around.'

'In fact finding material is half the fun, it's like a big treasure hunt.

'The pieces I find inspire the 
project a lot of the time, I will also come up with an idea and then 
save pieces for as long as it takes to accomplish it.'

Creative: Jeffro Uitto says, 'I'm going to have to live until I'm 300 years old to pull off all the ideas I have'

The various sticks, wooden slabs, and 
roots that he finds are cured and eventually found a fitting home as the
 artworks come together.

'It can be a very long process, from finding and drying the material to then putting the wood into a project.

'It's definitely challenging at 
times. Shaping, fitting and moving the wood takes a lot of energy, I'm 
going to have to live until I'm 300 years old to pull off all the ideas I
 have."
