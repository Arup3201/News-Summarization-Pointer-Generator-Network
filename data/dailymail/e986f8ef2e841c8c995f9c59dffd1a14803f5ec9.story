Prime Minister David Cameron speaks at the Commonwealth Games Business Conference in Glasgow where he hailed the benefits of the EU

David Cameron yesterday pledged to ‘modernise and reaffirm’ Britain’s membership of the European Union, as one of his ministers said leaving was ‘not an option’.

The Prime Minister, whose reshuffle last week promoted a number of Eurosceptics, struck a more positive tone about Europe yesterday, saying EU membership helps Britain ‘punch above our weight’.

At a business summit in Glasgow before the opening of the Commonwealth Games, he said: ‘In a world … where we have got the rise of new powers in the south and the east, in a world of dangers and difficulties with terrorism … being part of these networks and organisations actually increases your ability to punch above your weight.

‘We need not to leave these relationships unmodernised. We need to make sure they’re working for us. So when it comes to the EU I think we need to modernise our relationship and reaffirm it.

‘But the membership of these networks - and I would include the Commonwealth in that - actually helps Britain to be a centre for business and enterprise and we should make the most of these relationships.’

Mr Cameron has pledged to hold an In/Out referendum on Europe in 2017, following an attempt to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s membership of the EU.

The Prime Minister insists he can secure enough change to recommend keeping Britain in. Tory right-wingers now want him to pledge that he will lead the ‘Out’ campaign if Brussels refuses to hand back significant powers.

But business minister Lord Popat yesterday suggested there were no circumstances in which Britain should leave the EU.

Speaking during a debate in the Lords, he said: ‘We need the European Union for trade and the European Union needs us so exit is not an option.

‘What is important is that we re-negotiate some of the reforms in the EU to make it more practical in terms of business and productivity.’ 

The PM has promised an referendum on Europe in 2017, after trying to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership, but a minister yesterday said there was no circumstances under which Britain would leave

Meanwhile, Nigel Farage yesterday began a reshuffle designed to woo disaffected Labour voters by tackling UKIP’s ‘men in blazers’ image.

Former journalist Patrick O’Flynn was appointed as the party’s economic spokesman, while lawyer Steven Woolfe was appointed to the key role of immigration spokesman. Mr Woolfe said UKIP would introduce an ‘ethical immigration system’ based on a version of the points system used in Australia.

But Mr Farage also promoted a number of less well-known names, including two women, in an attempt to broaden the party’s appeal and tackle the impression that the party is a one-man band.

Actress-turned-MEP Louise Bours, a single mother, was appointed as the party’s health spokesman; Mike Hookem, a former serviceman and joiner, was made defence spokesman; former saleswoman Jill Seymour was handed the transport brief; and the party’s Liverpool-born deputy leader Paul Nuttall was put in charge of education and skills.

A party source said the changes were designed to target the Labour vote, where UKIP has been making heavy inroads.

‘This is the end of the men in blazers image,’ he said. ‘These are people who don’t have cut-glass accents and who have made something of themselves in life. It is a departure for us.

‘It’s all about targeting the blue collar voters – it is moving the party on in a slightly different direction.’

UKIP has been buoyed this week by a poll conducted by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft showing the party could seize at least two seats at the next election – Thurrock and Thanet South – because of its recent success in attracting Labour voters.
