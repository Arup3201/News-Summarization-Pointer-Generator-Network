Comedian Jason Manford has slammed the ticket policy of the theatre company where he is performing, describing booking agents as 'parasites' that rip off fans.

The married former One Show presenter - who quit the progamme in 2011 after being outed for sending graphic text messages to other women - is back on the stand-up trail.

However, there was nothing funny about his comments regarding the management of Oxford's New Theatre company over their cut of his ticket sales.

Disgusted: Comic Jason Manford launched an extraordinary Facebook tirade at the Oxford New Theatre over its ticket policy

Manford queried why the management were adding a £9 booking fee to the £22.50 face value price of the ticket, as well as taking a 20 per cent cut of the sales.

Controversy: Manford may be performing at the Oxford New Theatre, but that didn't stop him laying into its policies

He took to his Facebook page and advised people not to book the tickets in that way and he would 'of course put on my best show as I do every night'.

He wrote: 'Please please please do NOT buy these tickets. These booking agents are parasites of the highest order, overcharging you and making it look like it's the performer.

'I can only apologise for the people already booked, God bless you, I will of course put on my best show as I do every night.

'I just wish I'd have spotted it bloody sooner but all that is left to promoters and such like but just know that after this tour I will never play an ATG venue again until they lower their preposterous booking charges.

'I mean, you do it all your f****** self!

'That's what gets me, you log on, you choose your seats, you even print the b*****d out at home! What are they charging for?!!?

'How are they getting nearly half of what I get when I'm the one who spent a year writing and perfecting it, driving to the gig, paying travel, accommodation, tour manager, promoters, agents, advertising, not getting to put my kids to bed 6 nights a week for 10 months!

'I do my best to never rip anyone off but this makes my blood boil. I'm kicking myself for not noticing it sooner! Argh! Sorry!'

He added: 'I'm very angry about the booking charge that ATG add on to the face value of the ticket price.

Attack: Manford, centre, pictured on the set of Odd One Out, says the booking fees imposed on fans for big live events are a disgrace and has urged them to make a stand

Married Manford is no stranger to controversy. In 2011, he quit The One Show after being outed for sending sex texts to other women

'I deliberately lowered my ticket prices for this year's tour because of theatre booking fees.

'People work so hard for their money and to put an extra charge on top of the ticket prices really got me.

'Why charge a booking fee when it is all done online and you even print the tickets at home?'

ATG said it would not respond directly to his remarks but said: 'All, or the vast majority, of the sales income from the ticket goes to the producer, hence the need to charge for ticketing operations separately.

'However, booking fees only apply to customers who buy on the phone or online.

'The range of fees can vary depending on show genre and ticket price.'

The Mancunian star is due to appear at the Oxford New Theatre, George Street, Oxford, on Monday and again on Tuesday.
