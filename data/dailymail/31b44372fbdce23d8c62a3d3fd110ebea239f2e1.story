This is the photo which could solve one of aviation's most enduring mysteries - what happened to missing American aviator Amelia Earhart.

The pioneering pilot vanished without a trace over the South Pacific as she flew to the remote Howard Island.

It is thought this photo taken by a military surveyor could show a piece of the landing gear from Earhart's plane.

Mystery solved? This tiny dot could be part of the plane's landing gear sticking out of the water off the coast of Gardner Island in the Pacific

Now a team are trying to prove that the aviator, then 39, survived a crash in 1937 and managed to make her way to dry land.

It is thought that, unable to summon help in an era before satellite technology, she died some weeks later.

Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan
disappeared on July 2, 1937, while travelling from Lae, in New Guinea, 
to Howland Island during her bid to become the first woman to fly around
the world.

The picture which could show a 
landing gear from the aircraft was taken on Gardner Island, now known as
Nikumaroro Island, where a bundle of bones was found.

Efforts to solve the riddle have been
given fresh impetus after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced 
the government's support for a new $500,000 hunt to find her plane.

But conspiracy theories, including 
claims that they were U.S. government agents captured by the Japanese 
before World War II, abound despite having been largely debunked.

Enduring riddle: American avirator Amelia Earhart, posing by her plane in Long Beach, California, in 1930, disappeared while flying over the Pacific in 1937

Wading in: U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (left) is offering her support to a private salvage team which is planning to search the location where Earhart if believed to have crashed

Intrigue: In her day, Earhart was extremely popular, but her mysterious death has kept that fame alive more than 75 years later

Conspiracy? There have been many theories behind what happened to Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan

Numerous attempts to find the 
wreckage have failed.

Last year, divers in Bougainville, Papua New 
Guinea, said they were convinced they found the wreckage on Buka 
Island, some 400 miles from Lae.

But this new search focuses on Nikumaroro, which lies another 1,800 miles further east.

One senior U.S. official said new 
analysis of a contemporary photo of a portion of the island shows what 
some people believe could be a strut and wheel of the plane protruding 
from the water. 

Suspicions were also aroused when IGHAR found bone fragments thought to belong to Earhart on the island in 2010. Though tests to identify them proved inconclusive.

The administration takes no position on the purported evidence and acknowledges there is fierce debate on the subject.

An expedition, a joint public and 
private venture, will depart for the islands on the 75th anniversary of Earhart's departure on the ill-fated trip.

Previous visits to the island by the 
group have recovered artifacts that could have belonged to Earhart and 
Noonan and suggest they might have lived for days or weeks after landing
on a reef.

The State Department and other U.S. 
government agencies supported Earhart and her goal.

The State Department
obtained flight clearances from the countries in which she stopped and 
coordinated the search effort with foreign governments.

Salvage bid: This graphic shows the 
journey Earhart had intended to make between Papua New Guinea and Howard
Island in 1937. The 'site of the plane wreck' at Buka Island shows where a doomed aircraft was found. It is now believed this is a red herring and not linked to Earhart's doomed journey. This latest search will focus on Nikumaroro island (far right), where bones 
suspected of belonging to the aviator were found in 2010. It is also where the image which apparently shows a landing gear was found

The most widely accepted theory is that the aeroplane ran out of fuel and ditched in the sea. There have been several searches by many different professionals eager to solve the mystery, but none have been proven.

Another popular theory is that they landed on the island of Nikumaroro in the Pheonix Islands, 350 miles southeast of Howland Island and fended for themselves for serveral months until they succumbed to injury or disease. Improvised tools and bits of Plexiglas that are consistent with that of an Electra window were found on the island.

A few theorists reckon that she Earhart was spying on Japan and had been captured and executed. This theory has been discounted by the American authorities and press.

A rumour claimed that she was one of many women sending messages on Tokyo Rose, an English-language Japanese propaganda station designed to attack the Allies' morale.

An Australian aircraft engineer said he found a map that showed Earhart and Noonan may have turned round to try and refuel but crashed before getting to an airstrip.

The most whacky theory is that she was still alive and had a different identity. A woman fron New Jersey successfully sued for $1.5m in damages from the author of a book who pursued this theory.
