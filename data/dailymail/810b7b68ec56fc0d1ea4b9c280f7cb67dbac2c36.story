Bentley may build its new luxury off-roader in Bratislava rather than Britain, the firm's bosses have revealed.

In a dramatic blow to its 4,000-strong British work-force - and to Chancellor George Osborne ahead of today’s Budget - the firm's German chiefs announced at their annual results conference in London that they were considering manufacturing the £150,000 4X4 in the  Slovakian capital in Eastern Europe.

Bratislava and Crewe are now  ‘in competition’ to build up to 4,000 of Bentley’s first sports utility vehicle (SUV)  a year, with the final decision to be made within weeks, they said. Hundreds of new jobs are riding on the outcome.

Competition: Bentley's new SUV could be manufactured in Bratislava rather than Britain, the firm's bosses have revealed

Should Bratislava be chosen, the vehicle would become the first volume-produced Bentley to be built outside of the UK in the company's near 100 year history.It could not carry the plate that has adorned Bentleys for generations: ‘Made in Crewe, England’.

Bosses insisted it would still have ‘Bentley DNA’,  but admitted it the plaque would like be altered to read: 'Designed in Crewe, England'.

Critics say engineering genius and Bentley founder Walter Owen ‘W.O’ Bentley,  who founded the firm 94 years ago, would be turning in his grave along with generations of ‘Bentley Boys’ who treasure the car-maker. Its luxury vehicles are also famously a favourite of James Bond.

The new Bentley SUV is set to go on sale from 2015-16 and will be a central plank in plans to double the luxury car-maker sales to 15,000  by 2018 accounting for between a quarter and a third of all global sales. Sales were already up 22 per cent last year to 8,510.The final ‘green light ‘decision will be made within weeks by Bentley’s German parent Volkswagen Group, based at Wolfsburg in Northern Germany.Cheaper labour rates in Slovakia and ‘uncertainty’ over whether Britain will remain in the European Union if there is a referendum were counting against the British case, bosses said.

Craftsmanship, a ‘motivated’ British workforce, and the logical cost of transporting parts between Britain and Slovakia were in its favour, they added.

Directors denied playing off governments in a bid to boost  grants, noting that Crewe was in line for £7million in subsidies tied to more jobs being created.

Bentley’s chairman and chief executive Dr Wolfgang Schreiber said the decision on where to build up to 4,000 of the cars was one of the ‘last hurdles’ to be cleared as executives finalise the business case.

He said there was plenty of room to build the new Bentley at Crewe and that capacity ‘is not the issue.’ Key deciding factors will be labour rates, logistical costs, finance and craftsmanship. 

Made in Crewe? The SUV could become the first volume-produced Bentley to be produced outside of the UK should Crewe lose out to Bratislava

If production is moved to Bratislava, the new Bentley 4X4 will  be built alongside other cars belonging to the Volkswagen Group such as the Porsche Cayenne, Audi Q7 and Volkswagen Touareg.

Speaking at the top of the Gherkin skyscraper in the City of London Dr Schreiber said: ‘There is a chance that the whole car will be built in Bratislava. There is competition between the factories.’

’We want to build sustainable cars that make money,' he said.

‘We have the components and the craftsmanship skills in Crewe.'

Dr Schreiber and his two most senior Bentley board members  - including  sales and marketing director Kevin Rose, a Briton -  said they would prefer the model to be built in Crewe.

They denied they were facing opposition from the main German-based Volkswagen Group board pushing for the model to be built in Bratislava.

Dr Schreiber said: ’We are all fighting for the best decision for Bentley.

‘Everyone in Volkswagen knows how motivated and skilled the workers in Crewe are. Their interior craftsmanship is a true asset.’

'Best decision for Bentley': Bosses said the craftsmanship and skill of Bentley's Crewe-based workforce was a 'true asset'

Bentley did build some Flying Spur models in the Eastern German city of Dresden  during 2005 and 2006 because of a shortage of capacity at Crewe. But building the off-roader in Bratislava would be the first time a complete new model would have been built abroad.

However, interior components would have to be shipped from Crewe to ensure a luxury feel. Potential buyers have already placed more than 2,000 pre-orders  even before the final showroom styling of the car has been revealed.

Bentley’s chief finance officer Jan-Henrik Lafrentz said ‘stability’ was a key issue in the decision. The possibility of Britain leaving the EU - added to currency fluctuations between the Eurozone and the pound - were among issues being considered.

Final styling of the new car has already been signed off and will be very different from that shown on a much criticised ‘concept’ version which appeared at last year’s Geneva Motor Show. Bentley boss Dr Schreiber admitted there  had been ‘room for improvement’ The new model is expected to share the ‘face’ of the more familiar Bentley Continental.

He said: ’It's completely different now. It has the DNA of the current cars but looks even more special.’

Global sales director Kevin Rose said the new Bentley 4X4 would begin in price and prestige where the new rival Range Rover leaves off.

About  half of all sales will come from the United States and China followed by the Middle East, Russia and Europe. Some 87.3 per cent of Bentley’s cars are already  exported.

Bentley had considered calling the new 4X4 ‘Falcon’ but Mr Rose said he did not like it and that the company was looking at a name that would be more fitting across all its worldwide markets.

But Mr Rose insisted: 'If there is assembly  somewhere else, we’d still very much claim it as a Bentley. It has Bentley DNA.'Booming Bentley has been a huge success story for Volkswagen.

Operating profit is up from £6.85million to £86million, with turnover up 29.9 per cent to £1.2billion. It expects ‘double digit’ growth in 2013.

Germany’s  Volkswagen Group bought  Bentley in 1998 from Vickers PLC as part of a complicated three-way £430million deal in which their German rivals BMW took control of Rolls-Royce.
