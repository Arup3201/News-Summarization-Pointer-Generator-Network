A gang lay in wait for a man in his 20s before pouring acid over his face in a 'targeted' street attack, it was claimed today.

Police launched an investigation following the assault in Maidenbower, Crawley, West Sussex, at 7.10pm yesterday.

Paramedics, the air ambulance and police attended the scene, and the victim was taken to the Royal Sussex County Hospital.

West Sussex Councillor Duncan Crow, who witnessed the attack, said on Twitter: 'I donâ€™t believe what has just happened in Maidenbower.

Investigation: Police in Crawley, Sussex where a man has been the victim of an acid attack

'A man has been attacked with acid thrown in his face in a targeted attack. Thankfully the victim looks ok. Ambulance and six police cars now on scene.'

Cllr Crow said the men had laid in wait for their victim.

He said: 'I was at home working on my computer when I heard some shouting coming from outside, I initially ignored it and just assumed it was a normal argument.

'But then I heard screeching of tyres coming from the other side of where I live and I looked out the window to see a white Vauxhall Astra van being driven away at speed.

'I also saw a chubby black guy wearing a high-visibility jacket running down the road, I assumed he was initially separate from the incident but then I saw him jump in the van and it sped off at speed.

'He looked very plausible as a work man or somebody doing some door to door sales, he didn't look particularly suspicious.

West Sussex Councillor Duncan Crow, who witnessed the attack, spoke about it on Twitter

'When I looked out my other window I saw a guy rolling around on the grass shouting. A girl came out to see him and asked what was wrong and he said he had acid thrown over him.

'Others came out and were pouring water over him and treating him, I think even an off-duty fireman was present too. I was just so shocked by what I saw.

'It took a minute or so to piece it all together, I thought it was two separate incidents to begin with.

'I heard somebody say they must have been waiting for him to come home from work because it happened just as he got out of his car. It was clearly a targeted attack.'

Mr Crow, a councillor for the local area, added that he believed the man lived in the block of flats where the attack happened, but he was not known to him.

He also said the man had been discharged from hospital which led him to believe he was making a good recovery.

'Within 10 minutes of the attack he was up on his feet and was not shouting or screaming any more and you could see he was not badly injured,' he said.

A Sussex Police spokesman said: 'Sussex Police attended an incident in Crawley where a man had what is believed to be acid thrown over him.

'Emergency services were called to the scene in Lyon Close at 7.10pm. A man in his early 20s was attacked by two men just after 7pm and had the chemical poured over his face and hands.

'The victim was taken to the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton but was discharged.

'Police are making an urgent appeal for anyone who witnessed the incident or who may have seen two black men wearing hi-viz tops and in a white Vauxhall Astra van in the area before or after the attack.'
