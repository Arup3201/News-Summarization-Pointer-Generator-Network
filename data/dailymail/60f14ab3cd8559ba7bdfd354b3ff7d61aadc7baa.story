Rummaging through a suitcase and examining some newly delivered post… she couldn’t look more at home.

But while this woman may seem very interested in the belongings strewn around this hotel room, none of them are hers.

She is a hotel cleaner, who was caught on camera going through a guest’s things when she entered his room to change the sheets.

The cleaner, who works at an unidentified hotel chain in the U.S.,  can be seen looking through the guest's suitcase in the secret recording 

The young woman cleaning the room can also be seen looking at the PS3 Games belonging to the hotel guest after he set up a secret camera

Vince Stravix decided to leave his laptop camera recording when he stepped out of his room at an unidentified American hotel. 

And after capturing what the cleaner got up to when she thought she was alone, he put the video on YouTube to warn others to keep their belongings stored away at hotels.

The video has already had more than one million views on YouTube since it was uploaded on Saturday. 

Mr Stravix wrote on the website: ‘This happened on November 5, 2014. I was staying at a brand-named hotel and I kept all of my items laid out in my room. Not any more though…’ 

He added: ‘[I’m] making people aware that even in a hotel room someone could rifle through your things without you knowing, so password-protect everything you own and keep valuables locked up.’

You've got mail: The housekeeper was caught on camera reading the details on a package that was delivered to the guest

The housekeeper was caught on camera having a close look at the hotel guest's tablet while she was cleaning the room earlier this month

The video begins innocuously enough – the woman enters the room, wanders into the bathroom, and collects dirty towels into a pile. 

But while carrying out her chores, she can’t seem to resist having a closer look around.

She picks up a package addressed to Mr Stravix, before moving on to touch his games console, a PS3, and the games with it. 

After looking through the suitcase, she turns to the laptop, with Mr Stravix claiming she tried to type something on the keyboard. 

Although he refused to name the hotel or location, he said he has sent the management all of his footage.

YouTube users criticised the incident as a gross invasion of privacy. Others pointed out the housekeeper cleaned the bathroom, then made the bed, while wearing the same pair of gloves.

Opinions were mixed with one commenter advising the guest not to allow any housekeeping while another said: 'What I see is a curious lady looking without wrong intentions at items that she probably could not afford'
