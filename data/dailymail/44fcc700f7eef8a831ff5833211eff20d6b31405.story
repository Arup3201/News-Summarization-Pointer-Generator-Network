The last surviving rescue dog who searched Ground Zero for survivors and lifted the spirits of devastated first responders has returned to the site on the 13th anniversary of the tragedy.

Bretagne, a 15-year-old golden retriever, was just two when she and her owner, Denise Corliss, were sent from Texas to relieve search teams in New York - on what was their first ever deployment.

This week, Corliss and Bretagne, which is pronounced 'Brittany', returned to the Manhattan site for the first time since 2001.

'Seeing this kind of took my breath away a bit, similar to how the pile was the first time I saw it,' Corliss, 49, told the Today.com. 'It's so calm and peaceful now, unlike the chaos of before.'

The duo, from Cypress, Texas, were sent to the site to take over from the first wave of first responders a week after the terrorist attacks took nearly 3,000 lives.

They knew it was unlikely they would find anyone alive, but Corliss was still hopeful. 

'I really believed we could find somebody - anybody - if we could just get to the right void space,' she told Today. 'But our reality was much different. We found all various kinds of remains, some recognizable, others not so much.' 

It was their job to search an area of debris for survivors and once they were confident no one was there, they gave crews permission to clear that area of debris. 

Tired out: Corliss and Bretagne were sent to Ground Zero a week after the attacks and worked 12-hour days

But they quickly realized Bretagne also had other roles to fill as they worked 12-hour shifts for two weeks. 

In one instance, Bretagne ran away from her owner and over to a firefighter sitting sadly on the ground - and even when Corliss tried to get her to return, she refused.

'I was surprised that she wasn't listening to me, but she really wasn't - it was like she was flipping me the paw,' Corliss said. 'She went right to that firefighter and laid down next to him and put her head on his lap.'

Often, as the duo sat waiting for their next task, first responders would approach Bretagne and pet her and share their stories.

'It became an unexpected role of a therapy dog,' Corliss said on the Today show.

Corliss agrees, too, that Bretagne - her best friend - has been there for her over the years.

She said  her breath was taken away with how peaceful and quiet the site is now, unlike the chaos of 2001

By her side: Bretagne, who also sat in on the Today interview, is older but no less energetic, Corliss said

Emotional: They are seen visiting the pools at the memorial, where 13 years ago they searched for victims

They first started working together after Corliss, an electrical engineer, became interested in the work of disaster search dogs and looked into getting involved.

She learned that civilians can train their own dogs and, as long as they pass tests, they can support federal emergency response teams when disasters strike in the U.S.

In 1999, she took in eight-week-old Bretagne and got to work with her right away.

She told the Today show that it took between 20 and 30 hours of rigorous training every week - which she did when she wasn't working - and in 2000, they qualified to join Texas Task Force 1. 

After helping in the aftermath of 9/11, they were also deployed to sites, including Hurricane Katrina. 

Bretagne retired from searches at age nine, but she still enjoys working as a service dog in a local elementary school, where she helps children with special needs read out loud.

'She still has this attitude of putting her paw up and saying, "Put me in, coach!"' Corliss said. 'She absolutely loves it.' 

Bretagne is now one of eight finalists for the American Humane Association's annual Hero Dog Awards and will be traveling to Beverly Hills for the award ceremony in late September.

There is believed to be one other surviving search dog from 9/11, a 15-year-old English springer spaniel named Morgan, who worked on Staten Island.
