The Princess Royal was pictured at Sandown Park Racecourse today looking cool in a pair of sporty sunglasses that she borrowed from her daughter Zara Phillips.

The Queen's granddaughter, 33, was given the Adidas shades as part of her Team GB kit when she represented her country in the equestrian at the London 2012 Olympics.

The sunglasses were certainly lucky for the mother-of-one who won a silver medal in the team event.

So that's perhaps why Princess Anne chose to wear the sunglasses today in the hope they would be a lucky charm for her at the races in Esher.

The 64-year-old grandmother, who is 11th in line to the throne, looked happy and relaxed as she watched the horses compete.

But while the sun shone causing her to don Zara's sporty shades, temperatures remained cool so she stayed wrapped up in a beige double breasted coat, polo neck jumper and red scarf.

And just like her mother the Queen who is rarely keen on a public engagement without wearing hat, the princess wore a brown hat with tartan trim.

Anne, wearing pearl stud earrings, was pictured in the parade ring during the Grand Military Gold Cup Day at Sandown Park. 

The event dates back to 1841 and has always been a firm favourite with the British monarchy.

One of the races held today is named in memory of the Queen Mother who was an avid fan of the sport.

Earlier this week, the Princess Royal opened a new £2.3m youth arts centre in Jersey.

The St James Centre was built in a converted church in St Helier and will include a performance space, studios, rehearsal rooms and a radio station.

Meanwhile, Zara is busy training for the 2016 Rio Olympics with the hope of winning more medals - and perhaps more kit which she can share with her supportive mother.
