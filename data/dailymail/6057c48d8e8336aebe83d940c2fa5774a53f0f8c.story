A serial bride who became a 
'homegrown' British terrorist after she met and married her third 
husband through a Muslim dating site was jailed for eight years today.

Hairdresser Shasta Khan, 38, had 
claimed she was unlucky in love after her first two marriages had broken
down - the first when she said he had raped her and the second when he 
was exposed for having four extra marital affairs.

But she ended up becoming radicalised
by Al Qaeda and inspired by Osama Bin Laden after she met ex-car 
valeter Mohammed Khan, 33, on an introduction site named 'Single Muslim'
because she was looking to marry the 'Islamic way'.

Couple:
Mohammed and Shasta on their honeymoon in Turkey. A satnav from her 
Peugeout 305 showed the couple had been on multiple trips to Jewish 
populated areas around Manchester looking for targets to attack

Convicted: Shasta Khan, 38, left, and her husband, 
Mohammed Sajid Khan, 33, right, bought substances and equipment from 
supermarkets to assemble an improvised explosive device

She ditched her Westernised and 
'chilled out' lifestyle in favour of strict traditional Islamic dress, 
stopped watching her favourite TV shows like Coronation Street and 
Eastenders and tuned into terrorist propaganda on the internet instead.

Shasta and her husband later began 
planning to build a DIY device using chapatti flour, hairdressing 
chemicals and a set of Christmas tree lights from supermarkets to launch
a terrorist bomb attack upon Jewish communities in Manchester.

They also carried out reconnaisance 
missons on possible targets including a synagogue in the Prestwich area 
and she was said to have used her home-based hairdressing business Sassy
Hair Studio as a front to seek targets as part of a 'personal jihad.'

But the plot was exposed by chance in 
July last year when police were called to a report of a bust up between 
Khan and Shasta's father.

Khan was initially arrested on 
suspicion of stealing his father-in-law's car but anti terror officers 
were called in after a member of Shasta's family expressed concerns Khan
was a 'homegrown' terrorist.

Police raided the couple's two up two 
down terrace in Oldham, Greater Manchester found a string of documents 
with titles including '39 Ways to Serve and Participate in Jihad'.

couple's house in Oldham, Manchester. Prosecutors said behind their 
'apparent normality of daily life' the couple planned to carry out 
'jihad at home' after becoming radicalised

Today at Manchester Crown Court 
Shasta was convicted of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of 
terrorism and two counts of possessing a record of information likely to
be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism.

She denied the charges. Her husband 
pleaded guilty to engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of 
terrorism. He was given an indeterminate sentence and must serve a 
minimum of seven and a half years before being considered eligible for 
parole. .

After the case Det Chief Supt Anthony 
Mole, head of the North West Counter-Terrorism Unit, said: 'It is 
impossible to say with any certainty what their exact endgame was or 
what their specific targets may have been but the evidence suggests they
were in the attack-planning stage of a terrorist act motivated by 
anti-Semitic beliefs.

Chemicals used in Mrs Khan’s work, such 
as bleach, left, acetone and peroxide, were capable of being 
transformed into explosives. Right is a digital frequency radio used in reconnaissance missions

'What we must acknowledge is the 
dangers posed by the relatively easy access to online publications which
contain instructions on how to make viable explosive devices from 
everyday household items, and how this can create 'home-grown' 
terrorists.

'The Khans did not need to travel to 
training camps in Pakistan or Afghanistan - the knowledge they needed to
commit a terrorist act was available at the click of a few buttons from
the confines of their own home. This was 'jihad at home'.

'I would like to pay tribute to the 
diligence and hard work of all the officers who worked on this case. It 
is no exaggeration to say that their efforts to ensure the Khans were 
charged and ultimately convicted has saved people's lives.'

Found
by police: Seemingly innocuous and innocent items like these Christmas 
tree lights, bulbs and a battery found at the address had a more 
sinister purpose the jury was told. This was one of the most significant
finds

fire lighters, safety goggles, a funnel, needles and syringes were also 
part of the paraphernalia found a the couple's address

This post it notes found at the house made 
references to a Tokarev gun and right, this metal pan was found in the 
rear garden. Shasta Khan told the jury she had no involvement in 
terrorism or her husband’s activities

Earlier the trial was told Shasta had 
been born in the UK but as a teenager was sent to Pakistan by her family
into a forced marriage after her younger sister was caught with a 
boyfriend.

She had a daughter now aged 18 by her 
first husband but the marriage ended amid claims he repeatedly raped 
Shasta. She wed again but it crumbled when her new husband left her amid
allegations he had four affairs.

She met Khan originally from Bradford,
West Yorkshire, on the Muslim dating site in July 2010 after claiming 
depression of having two broken marriages led to pray five times a day.

He had been previously married to a white woman but claimed he was looking for a wife 'in this life and the next'.

'It is impossible to say with any 
certainty what their exact endgame was or what their specific targets 
may have been but the evidence suggests they were in the attack-planning
stage of a terrorist act motivated by anti-Semitic beliefs.'

Det Chief Supt Anthony Mole

He proposed an Islamic marriage three 
days after the initial meeting when she said she regarded his dating 
profile as a 'beautiful sentiment'.

They married in August 2010 and they 
were pictured enjoying a honeymoon in Turkey and looking happy and 
relaxed as they rode a jetski.

But within weeks of the wedding the 
couple became strict Islamists with Khan wearing long white robes and 
growing a beard whilst she wore a burka.

They started reading and listening to 
extremist Al Qaeda-inspired media in November 2010 and behind the 
apparent normality of daily life, the couple believed in and supported 
an extreme ideology of jihad or holy war against the 'enemies of Islam' -
especially Jewish people.

Later the couple drove to Prestwich 
where he directed her to a Jewish temple and observed worshippers 
arriving and leaving. Whilst there Khan said: 'We must kill them all.'

Between March and July 2011, the 
couple began to access online bomb-making manuals and acquired everyday 
household items from supermarkets and high street retailers which could 
be used to construct a DIY device.

But the plot fell apart after Shasta's
brother, Ibrahim, identified Khan as a 'home-grown terrorist' and that 
when police spoke to her, she spilled the beans on her husband's 
activities. She was then arrested herself.

In her defence Shasta said she had been frightened of her husband and denied wrongdoing.

She described her husband as 'racist',
telling the jury he said she did not believe in Allah because she mixed
with white people. Asked if she had a problem with Jewish people, she 
said: 'No. I have friends in Prestwich. I used to live there.'
