This is the moment an escaped elephant crushed a car by climbing on top of it during mating season at a Thai national park.

The silver vehicle, carrying a family, was making its way through the Khao Yai National Park near Bangkok on the way to National Children's Day celebrations nearby.

However, the driver of the car was forced to stop as the male elephant wandered out into the middle of the road and approached the car. 

The silver car was making its way through the Khao Yai National Park, when an elephant approached the vehicle and tried to sit on it 

Footage shows the elephant putting its front legs on the vehicle before bringing up its hind legs and standing on the bonnet 

After a few seconds the elephant then appears to jump off the car leaving the front of the vehicle badly dented and with a cracked windscreen 

Footage filmed by  a mobile phone from within the vehicle, then shows the animal getting extremely close to the car before resting its trunk on the bonnet.

Then the elephant can be seen putting its two front feet on top of the bonnet before bringing up its hind legs and almost sitting on the front of the vehicle.

The giant creature then jumps off the car on to the ground and walks away leaving a badly dented bonnet with a cracked windscreen.

Before climbing on top of the car, the elephant approached the vehicle after wandering out into the middle of the road 

The animal appeared to rest its trunk on the bonnet before going on to stand on top of the car. Vets believe the elephant may have been stressed due to mating season 

Fortunately the family inside the vehicle were unharmed.

It is the second such incident this month involving an elephant inside the park after one damaged another three vehicles on New Year's Day.

It is unclear if the same elephant was involved in both incidents.

Patarapol Maneeorn, a government veterinarian told the National that elephants do not usually approach cars, but this particular creature might be stressed due to mating season.

Earlier this month, an elephant also damaged three cars within the same national park, although vets are unsure if it was the same creature 

He said: 'In the mating season, the elephant might have developed some stress. Moving vehicles might have added to the tension.'

Male elephants are usually forced out of their herd when they reach reproductive age so they do not mate with their blood relatives.

It is thought this is why the elephant has escaped and people driving through the park are being told to be extra vigilant.
