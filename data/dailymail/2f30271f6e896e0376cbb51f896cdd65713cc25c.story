Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson received a £3.2million payout from the production company he started before selling his stake to BBC Worldwide, it has emerged.

The BBC's highest paid star then landed up to £15million from the sale of his 30 per cent stake in Bedder 6.

The company was a joint project with BBC Worldwide, the corporation’s commercial wing, which has now taken full control of the 50 per cent share that was split between Clarkson and Top Gear producer Andy Wilman.

Clarkson's share previously furnished the wealthy star with a hefty annual dividend - the most recent coming to £2.7million, up from £1.8m the previous year.

He was also paid a talent fee of £456,000, an increase of 30 per cent on his £350,000 fee last year, according to Company House accounts seen by the Daily Telegraph.

Lucrative: The firm gave Clarkson a £2.7m dividend last year, on top of his talent fee as one of the BBC's highest paid stars and the money from his books and other ventures

Bedder 6 was set up five years ago with the intention of exploiting the programme’s global brand.

Clarkson has just signed a lucrative new deal to continue presenting BBC 2's popular motoring show for three more years alongside James May and Richard Hammond.

Top Gear has been one of Worldwide’s 
biggest moneyspinners and Bedder 6 has had huge success from merchandise, book and DVD sales, show tours and international sales rights.

Clarkson is now likely to be paid a fixed annual £500,000 talent fee by the broadcaster up until 2015.

A spokesman for BBC Worldwide said: 'BBC 
Worldwide has agreed new commercial deals with Jeremy, James, Richard 
and Andy to secure Top Gear’s international future for another three 
years.

'This agreement secures the commercial 
future of Top Gear without using a penny of licence fee money and allows
us to continue to grow the brand around the world, reinvest in Top Gear
and return profits to the BBC.'

Clarkson and Wilman went to the same prestigious private school in Repton, Derbyshire, where they were two years apart, before working together on various TV projects including Top Gear.

The name Bedder 6 is believed it is a pun on 'better sex' - a reference to an in-joke about one of the dormitories at Wilman and Clarkson's former school.

The often controversial star caused particular outrage when it emerged that he earned £3m in the year to March because of his stake in Bedder 6,which made pre-tax profits of £15.2m and is estimated to be worth more than £50m.

He is also a weekly columnist for the Sunday Times and has become a prolific book writer, mainly of best-selling collections of his columns. He is also in demand on the after dinner speaker circuit, where he can command at least £20,000 a time.

The 52-year-old lives in the Cotswolds, where he has become a member of 'the Chipping Norton set', and owns a £1.2m lighthouse holiday home in an Isle of Man beauty spot, set in about 40 acres of coastland.

However, the 52-year-old told a BBC interviewer in 2009: 'I'm literally not the slightest bit interested in money. I just don't pay any attention to money, it's rather vulgar.'

Top Gear's success has a lot to do with Jeremy Clarkson's unique writing and presenting style, but the outspoken 52-year-old has run into plenty of controversy along the way.

In November 2008 he made a joke about how tough it is to change gear in a lorry - and linked it to the Suffolk Strangler Stephen Wright, who murdered sex workers in Ipswich.

Clarkson (pictured right) said: 'Change gear, change gear, change gear, check mirror, murder a prostitute, change gear, change gear, murder. That’s a lot of effort in a day.'

In February 2009, Clarkson famously called then-prime minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot'.

A year later he illustrated dangerous driving conditions with a joke about a woman in a burka wearing a red G-string, which was branded 'distasteful'.

Spin doctor Alastair Campbell revealed on his blog in the same month that in an un-aired comment Clarkson was asked by him about gay rights and he replied, 'I demand the right not to be bummed.'

In other gaffes he compared a Ferrari to a person with special needs, called Mexicans 'lazy', 'feckless' and 'flatulent', said long queues at airport control could be solved by 'a bit of racism' and was caught parking in a disabled driver bay while filming - receiving large numbers of complaints.  

Earlier this year he compared a Japanese car to the Elephant Man and people with 'growths on their faces'.

The BBC Trust’s editorial standards committee this week gave him another slap on the wrist for the scripted remarks, ruling that he had 'strayed into an offensive stereotypical assumption'.

Probably his most shocking moment came on The One Show, where he said that striking public sector workers 'should be shot in front of their families'.

Clarkson was forced to apologise and the regulator launched an investigation after his remark sparked around 31,700 complaints. He was later cleared.
