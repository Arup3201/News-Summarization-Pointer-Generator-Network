Celebrities are known for sharing their private lives online but a DJ has taken it to a new level.

DJ Deadmau5 revealed his insides to his millions of fans after apparently travelling under an airport baggage X-ray.

The DJ, who recently became engaged to tattooist Katy Von D after proposing to her on Twitter, is seen lying face first on the conveyer belt and going through the scanner.

The Canadian DJ - real name Joel Zimmerman - posted the video on YouTube three days ago and it has already been viewed almost 150,000 times.

He told his 1.8million Twitter followers: 'kinda always wanted to do this... thanks mexico!'

As his body travels under the X-ray, friends and members of the DJ's entourage can be heard cheering and laughing, with one saying 'oh my God' off camera.

Deadmau5 then apparently climbs out and runs to look at the image, pointing and laughing at the screen.

DJ Deadmau5 (pictured right) Tweeted the video and said being X-rayed in the security scanner was something he always wanted to do

His fiancee Kat Von D also appears at the end of the video.Â 

Some commenters have expressed doubt about whether the stunt was genuine as he is not seen climbing in or out of the scanner.

If it was real, the DJ would have been exposed to levels of radiation - but these are not believed to be harmful in small doses.

The DJ and television personality Kat Von D hit the headlines last month when he asked her to marry him over Twitter.

'I can't wait for Christmas so.... Katherine Von Drachenberg, will you marry me?' the 31-year-old DJ wrote.

He posted a picture of a diamond ring flanked by two skulls and she accepted.
