A motorist convicted of driving offences after tweeting about a collision with a cyclist has said she was the victim of cyberbullying because of the post.

Emma Way, 22, from Watton, Norfolk, was found guilty at Norwich Magistrates' Court of failing to stop after a collision and failing to report an accident.

Way refused to comment as she left court yesterday. It later emerged she had signed an exclusive television deal with ITV's Daybreak.

following the crash

Regret: Miss Way described the tweet as her 'biggest regret' and rated it '11 out of 10' on the stupidity scale

Magistrates heard that police only became
 aware of the collision on May 19 because Miss Way tweeted 'definitely 
knocked a cyclist off his bike earlier. I have right of way - he doesn't
 even pay road tax!' using the hashtag #bloodycyclists afterwards.

Cyclist Toby Hockley suffered bruising and minor damage to his bike in the incident near the village of Rockland All Saints, Norfolk.

Appearing on Daybreak this morning, Way said that she regretted the Twitter post but did not believe the collision was her fault. 

She added: 'It has been really tough. I’ve had malicious communications and the person I’ve been made out to be is as far from who I am as can be.

'I was quite angry about his mannerism and... that he was on my side of the road and it seemed somehow disrespectful.'

'I am only 22 and, not generalising about 22-years-olds or anything, but you sometimes just tweet things you don't actually mean.

'There were lots of retweets, malicious messages and cyber-bulling so it's been quite bad.'

Her solicitor, Simon Nicholls (right), said: 'It can be hard enough at the best of times but when there's an apparent admission on the internet, you have to explain that'

Way, who stressed she did not receive a 
fee for the appearance, was sacked from her job as a trainee accountant 
with Norwich-based Larking Gowen after the tweet came to light. The 
court heard she has now got a new job.

She had previously described her tweet as her 'biggest regret' and rated it '11 out of 10' on the stupidity scale.

Her solicitor, Simon Nicholls, added that it had been a difficult case to defend.

'It can be hard enough at the best of times but when there's an apparent admission on the internet, you have to explain that,' he added.

Mr Hockley said he felt the tweet was 'stupid'.

He added: 'It doesn't do much for the mutual respect we should all have for each other on the road.'

Way had about 200 Twitter followers when she sent the message and used to tweet daily.

She has since quit the social networking site.

Confession: This tweet by user Emma Way was met with shock and prompted an investigation by Norfolk police

Magistrate
 Martin Cliffe fined her £337 and ordered her to pay £300 in costs, also
 adding seven penalty points to her licence.

She was cleared of a third 
charge of driving without due care and attention.

Superintendent
 Dave Marshall, Norwich police district commander, said: ‘Miss Way’s 
online comments did not represent responsible driving behaviour.’
