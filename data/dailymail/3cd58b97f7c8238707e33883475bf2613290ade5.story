A 21-year-old college student was found dead in her apartment Monday and police believe her boyfriend strangled her to death.

Brooke Locke was a third-year occupational therapy student at Husson University in Bangor, Maine and shared the apartment on Essex street with her boyfriend and fellow Husson student Zachary Mailloux, 21.

Police were called to the apartment Monday after receiving complaints. They found Locke's body and her boyfriend on the scene and Mailloux was then arrested on suspicion of murder.

Scene of the crime: Locke's body was discovered at 166 Essex Street in Bangor, Maine. Her boyfriend spoke with police on the scene and was soon after arrested on suspicion of murder

A neighbor told the Bangor Daily News that she was 'shocked' by the murder and that she saw Mailloux as he was being questioned by police.

'I walked right past their door,' Emily Linehan said. 'He looked perfectly normal. He didn't seem upset.'

Friends close to Locke, however, say that the couple had been going through a break-up at the time.

'I spoke with her on Facebook chat the other day and asked her why [she] and Zack had broken up,' said Nikki Raney, Locke's sorority sister in Epsilon Tau Epsilon. 'She didn't go into much detail, but I wish there was more that could have been done. It's so hard for me to come to terms with the fact that I will never see her at the deli or around campus, or at a sorority event.'

Bad breakup: According to friends, Locke (left) and her boyfriend were going through a breakup

The victim's father, William Locke, is a truck driver and his company paid for him to park his truck in Los Angeles and fly back home to Darby, Montana to be with his wife and their 8-year-old son.

'I couldn't drive,' Mr Locke told the Sun Journal. 'I couldn't.'

Mr Locke says his parents are 'going through hell' and his wife - Brooke's step-mom - is 'beside herself' after hearing about the young woman's death.

Appearances: Husson senior Matthew Blake was surprised to hear that Locke had died, since he saw the couple on campus often and they always looked happy

Despite the couple's recent break-up, other Husson students were surprised to hear about the couple's problems.

'It definitely took me by surprise. When I saw them together on campus they always seemed happy. It blew me away,' said Husson Senior Matthew Blake.

'A lot of people were talking about it. It's hard to believe somebody you see everyday in the hall is capable of that. It absolutely shocked everybody,' Mr Blake added.

Locke's freshman English teacher at Husson was equally as shocked to hear about her student's death.

Morgiana
Halley, 71, has had students in abusive relationships in the past and 
saw no indication that was the case with Locke and Mailloux.

'The thing that drives me crazy is that it's such a waste,' Ms Halley said.

Little
is known about what happened Monday to cause the fatal attack on Locke.
The police affidavit has been sealed while Mailloux undergoes a psych 
evaluation to see whether he is fit to stand trial.

The
affidavit will be reopened once he is indicted by a grand jury. Until 
then, he will be held without bail at the Penobscot County Jail.

'He
seems to be in okay shape,' his court-appointed attorney Jeff 
Silverstein told WCSH. 'Ya know, I think it's very overwhelming for him 
and the family of the deceased...I have not had an opportunity to 
contact his family members yet, so really this all happened very 
swiftly.'

Both
Locke and Mailloux were locals to Maine. Locke attended Edward Little 
High School in Lewiston, Maine. Mailloux went to high school in northern
Houlton, Maine, near the Canadian border.

'Being
a small school, many teachers and administrators recall Zack and we 
feel disheartened that these unfortunate events have taken place,' 
Houlton High School principal Marty Bouchard said.

A candlelight vigil will be held on campus for Locke Sunday evening followed by a funeral Monday.
