Dropped in: Xiao Chien calmly sits in the hospital waiting room with a knife wedged into his brain

When Xiao Chien felt a sharp blow to his head while walking down the road, he didn't panic.

After investigating the cause of the sudden pain and discovering a large knife protruding from his skull, he calmly decided to stroll on home and call an ambulance.

Mr Chien had been walking through Guangyuan City in the province of Sichuan, south-west China, when a woman accidentally dropped a gardening knife from a twelfth floor balcony.

The blade, which had been used for trimming plants, plunged into Mr Chien's head with such force, that it embedded itself 12 centimetres into his brain after piercing his skull.

On realising what had happened, Mr Chien began his journey home - but only made it 100 metres before stopping because he felt faint.

Chinese doctors believe Mr Chien's amazingly composed reaction was a result of the knife damaging the part of his brain that sends out panic signals.

At the sight of the dazed Mr Chien, shocked passers-by called emergency services and the injured man was taken to hospital, where surgeons operated to remove the wedged knife.

Miraculously, doctors believe he has escaped without any permanent damage.

Speaking from his hospital bed, Mr Chien told local media: 'I felt a blow to my head and I could see stars for a few seconds.

'When I put my hand up to see if the was any blood I could feel something sticking out of my head.

'I felt remarkably calm about the whole thing, and realised that I couldn't pull it out.

The 12-centimetre blade plunged Mr Chien's head up to the hilt -as shown by the shocking x-ray taken when he arrived in hospital

'I thought maybe the best thing to do would be to go home and call an ambulance but after about hundred metres I felt faint and I had to sit down.'

Doctors say Mr Chien's neural functions including eyesight, hearing, touch and cognitive abilities, all seem to be working normally. 

They added that if there was no sign of infection within a day then he could be released. 

Miraculous: Mr Chien has been told by doctors that the knife does not appear to have caused permanent damage
