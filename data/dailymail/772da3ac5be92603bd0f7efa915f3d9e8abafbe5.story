They are among the world’s most spectacular natural phenomena.

But as many travellers who have braved the sub-zero conditions in the hope of witnessing the Northern Lights will be only too aware, there is no guarantee that the swirling light show will make an appearance.

However, Norwegian cruise line Hurtigruten are so confident that holidaymakers will be able to witness the lights on one of their voyages that they are now offering visitors a free second trip if they are not visible.

They say that anyone booking a £999 per person 11-night Classic Round Voyage around Norway between 1 October and 31 March next year before 30th November will be offered the deal.

They say that if the Lights appear, an announcement will be made to everyone on-board by the Captain.

If they do not make an appearance guests will be given a choice of joining the company’s seven-day Classic Voyage North, or six-day Classic Voyage South between 1 October 2015 and 31 March 2016, although they say that flights, which cost around £330 from Britain, will not be included.

The company have become the first operator to offer such a promise, which coincides with an 11-year period known as ‘solar maximum’ by scientists when the Lights are more vivid than usual.

Optimum Northern Lights viewings are the northern reaches of Finland, Iceland, Canada and Alaska

Displays of the Northern Lights occur when solar particles enter the Earth’s atmosphere and on impact emit burning gases that produce green, yellow and blue-coloured lights

Displays of the Northern Lights occur when solar particles enter the Earth’s atmosphere and on impact emit burning gases that produce green, yellow and blue-coloured lights. The scientific term for the Lights is the aurora borealis.

The traditional places for optimum Northern Lights viewings are the northern reaches of Scandinavia, Finland, Iceland, Canada and Alaska.

The Lights themselves can only be seen between September and March each year.

Displays of the Lights are notoriously unpredictable and cannot be forecast in advance.

In addition to the absence of the Northern Lights appearing, visibility can often be reduced by cloud cover and light pollution from nearby towns.

Previous attempts to appease disappointed visitors have included the introduction of The Aurora Reykjavic centre in Iceland, a huge HD projection that aims to recreate the Northern Lights.

A spokesman for Hurtigruten said: ‘It has been a truly spectacular couple of years for sightings of the Northern Lights in Northern Norway. 

Hurtigruten are confident holidaymakers will be able to witness the lights on one of their voyages 

'If you take a Classic Round Voyage with us, you will spend seven days out of the 12 under the key “aurora oval” area.

‘We cannot of course guarantee that you will see the lights during their voyage (only Mother Nature can do that). 

'But we can do the next best thing which is to promise that if the lights prove elusive, we will give you another opportunity to see them next year.’

Dr John Mason MBE, renowned astronomer, aurora-hunter and Principal Lecturer at the South Downs Planetarium in Chichester, added: ‘For the best chance of seeing the Northern Lights, you need to stay in the auroral zone or be near to it.

‘This is a narrow ring, roughly around the Arctic Circle, that passes right over northern Norway. Hurtigruten's voyages spend seven days within or close to the auroral zone - no one else offers that.

'I have been incredibly fortunate that even when the weather forecast has been rather poor, I have never failed to experience the magical Northern Lights on a Hurtigruten voyage.’
