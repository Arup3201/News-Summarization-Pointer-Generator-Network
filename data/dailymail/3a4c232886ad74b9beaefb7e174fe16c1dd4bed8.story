In every pair of siblings there is always a good one and a bad one, and it seems the same is true of bear cubs.

Wildlife photographer Greg Harvey, 43, captured one male brown bear cub picking on his sister while he was on a visit to Alaska.

Mr Harvey, who lives in Alberta, Canada, says: 'I could see the male tormenting the female every chance he got.

How rude: A male brown bear cub appears to stick his tongue out at his sister after the pair were pictured play fighting with each other in Alaska

Wildlife photographer Greg Harvey, 43, said the male cub kept picking on his sister, and even bit her on the backside after chasing her

Mr Harvey said the female cub was rarely the aggressor and even ran to her mother for safety after her brother kept on biting her

'While she held her own, she was rarely the aggressor and from time to time would get mad at her brother and would try to hide  by cuddling  her mom.'

'When she had enough she tried to run away, but the little boy wasn't having any of that. He chased after her and bit her on the bum.'

The brown bear cubs are only 15-months-old and eager to play with each other; however it seems the brother bear often takes it a little too far.

Mr Harvey estimates that the two cubs were only 15 months old when he photographed them in 2011, and were still keen on playing together

Mr Harvey said he likes anthropomorphic images, in which the animals seem to be carrying out human actions suck as sticking their tongues out 

Mr Harvey, a self-taught photographer, said: 'The funny thing about anthropomorphism is it can happen at any time. People often ask about the story behind the images. Truthfully, the stories of any interest are normally what happens behind the scenes in a strange country.

'A brown bear cub wets his lips or tastes the air, and it looks like he is sticking his tongue out at his sister because of her body language as she cuddles up to her mom. I enjoy anthropomorphic images and am over the moon when I am lucky enough to acquire these kinds of images.'

The photographer explained that many of his colleagues are in the field taking pictures up to 200 days per year. He added: 'I have to find a way to compete with them with only 14 days on safari per year.'

Unlike many of his colleagues who can spend up to 200 days in the field every year, Mr Harvey only spends 14 days on safari

While these young bear cubs are small, they will eventually weigh up to 700lbs as adults, eat up to 90lb of food each day and measure up to 8ft long
