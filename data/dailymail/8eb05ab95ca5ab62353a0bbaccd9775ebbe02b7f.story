Police are investigating a new lead in the baffling disappearance of flight MH370 - the possibility that the plane's huge cargo of exotic fruit could have contained a hidden explosive device.

There was laughter at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur when officials revealed that the only cargo on the Boeing 777 jet was a four-ton consignment of mangosteens, a purple-skin tangy fruit with white segments inside that's popular in Asian countries.

But we've now learned that police are trying to establish whether there was a deadly link to the seemingly harmless cargo ordered by companies in China.

Mystery: Investigators are now looking into a possible theory that a bomb was hidden inside a crate of fruit on board MH370

It has not escaped investigating officers that it would be easy to conceal explosive material inside a number of the thousands of pieces of fruit loaded in crates onto the aircraft.

Malaysian Airlines CEO Mr Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, confirming that 'three to four tons' of mangosteens were on the aircraft, insisted that the cargo had been screened as a matter of routine.

Several theories are being investigated, including that there was a bomb on board

But an intelligence source in Kuala Lumpur said today that it would not be difficult to 'bury' some kind of explosive material inside the fruit, particularly if it was in the centre of a crate.

That explosive could then be set off electronically by someone on board the aircraft, prepared to die if the blast brought the jet down.

The triggering device could have been hidden inside an innocent looking mobile phone, experts say.

Investigators have not ruled out the possibility of a major catastrophic event causing the aircraft to suddenly soar up to 45,000ft, rendering everyone on board unconscious, particularly if a blast in the cargo hold had torn a hole in the side of the frame.

Out of control, it could have turned sharply westwards and continued flying straight out into the Indian Ocean until it ran out of fuel.

'This is yet another theory,' said a police officer. 'But we are not discounting anything.'

Acting Transport Minister Hishamuddin Hussein has also said that nothing is being ruled out and that all theories and possibilities were being investigated.

But he said that no official comment would be made on any information until it could be completely confirmed.

All ground crew at the airport - 'anyone who has touched the aircraft', said Mr Ahmad - are under investigation as the probe into the jet's fate continued today.

The backgrounds of all passengers - most of whom were Chinese - are also being checked and double-checked.

And further investigations are being carried out into the backgrounds of two Iranians known to have used stolen passports to board the flight as the first leg of a purported journey to Europe to start new lives.

Intelligence sources in Iran have told Malaysian investigators and Interpol that Pouria Nour Mohammad Merhdad, 19, and Delavar Seyed Mohammad Erza, 29, have no known links to terrorist groups.

They are believed to have purchased the stolen passports in Kuala Lumpur, from where, investigators have established, asylum seekers using stolen EU passports have set out to fly to Europe.
