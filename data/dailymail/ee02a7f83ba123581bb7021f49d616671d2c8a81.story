European countries could be billed for benefits paid to foreign nationals who arrive in Britain, MailOnline can reveal.

Ministers are examining the idea that welfare payments made to EU nationals could be charged back to their home countries.

The recharge scheme would apply for the first two years that a migrant was in the UK, and would seek to tackle the impression that Britain was a soft touch on benefits.

Recoup: The costs of paying benefits to foreign nationals would be reclaimed from their home countries under plans being considered by ministers

The government has stepped up efforts to limit access to Britain’s welfare system for new arrivals.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has vowed to fight European Commission demands to water down rules on benefit claims by EU immigrants.

The UK government will go to court in a battle with the Commission, who want to challenge a key part of our safeguards to ensure that benefits are only paid to people who are legally allowed to live in Britain.

The controversial ‘Go home or face 
arrest’ poster vans targeted at illegal immigrants are to be axed 
because they have been ineffective.

Sources
close to Home Secretary Theresa May said she had examined the evidence 
for continuing the Government’s billboard campaign which resulted in the
voluntary repatriation of just one person.

‘She doesn’t think there was anything 
wrong with the principle of the scheme but it is clear it has not been 
effective,’ said one source.

The
campaign has been piloted in six London boroughs featuring leaflets and
posters with the message: ‘In the UK illegally? Go home or face 
arrest.’

Two vans were driven around displaying
the slogan and advertising a telephone helpline offering support and 
advice to illegal migrants who want to leave the UK.

Ministers want to tackle the ‘pull factors’ which attract migrants from the rest of Europe to Britain.

Bureaucrats in Brussels insist there is no evidence people are attracted to the UK by its welfare system.

But now ministers are examining the idea of having the cost of benefits for foreigners refunded by the country they came from.

A growing number of northern European countries are thought to be keen to tackle the cost of benefits paid to people from elsewhere in the EU.

A Foreign Office source said: ‘Officials have been asked if it is possible to return to the system that was in place until the 1990s.

'For the first two years someone was here, we would pay the benefits and then charge the cost back to their home country.

‘It might not raise huge sums but it would send a clear message about who is picking up the bill for these people.’

Almost one in 10 people claiming Jobseekers' Allowance is not British. Latest figures show 142,300 foreign nationals were on the dole, including 35,000 from the EU.

The move comes as ministers vow to step up efforts to recoup the costs of NHS treatment for foreign nationals.

A major new government study puts the cost of ‘health tourism’ at £2billion, up to 100 times more than previously thought.

It concluded the Health Service has 
‘some of the most generous rules in the world’. And it even found 
evidence of relatives of migrants taking advantage of visits to Britain 
to have free treatment.

Ministers
have vowed to improve the way the NHS claims back the cost of treating 
visitors’ treatment from the European Economic Area from their home 
countries.

At present the 
habitual residence test applies to most people from the EEA, which 
includes all the member states of the EU and Iceland, Liechtenstein and 
Norway.

Claimants: Official figures show how tens of thousands of foreign nationals are on benefits in the UK

Bill: The cost of health tourism has been put at £2billion by a new government study

It covers benefits including Jobseeker's Allowance, housing benefit, council tax benefit and Income Support.

To receive welfare payments they must prove they have a right to reside, including being able to support themselves, be working and planning to stay in the UK for some time.

Government officials have warned ministers that reclaiming the cost of benefits from home countries could be hard to reintroduce, because the EU has expanded markedly since it was phased out.

However, the Tories are determined to take a tough line on immigration ahead of the lifting of restrictions on migrant workers from Bulgaria and Romania coming to Britain.
