Disgraced: Anton Casey, pictured with his wife Bernice, caused outrage by sneering at poor people on Facebook

A British banker who caused  outrage by sneering at poor people on Facebook lost his job yesterday, having been forced to flee Singapore with his family.

Disgraced Anton Casey, 39, sneaked out of the city state on an economy-class flight to Perth in Australia with a hat pulled down over his face.

Hours later his employer, Crossinvest Asia, pointedly used Facebook to announce his departure.

Mr Casey, who was accompanied by his wife Bernice, a former Miss Singapore, and their five-year-old son, triggered fury last week by posting a series of insulting Facebook updates that quickly spread around the globe. It led to a campaign to deport him.

In one post, the wealth manager, who lived in Singapore for 12 years, complained about experiencing ‘the stench of public transport’ while his Porsche was in the garage.

He also described a taxi driver as a ‘retard’ and posted a photograph of his son sitting on a train with the caption: ‘Daddy where is your car and who are all these poor people?’

In a grovelling email yesterday sent from Australia to a Singapore newspaper, the former HSBC  banker described his remarks as ‘the worst mistake of my life’.

Mr Casey wrote: ‘I hope the people of Singapore will allow me to volunteer my time and resources to community projects to make amends.

‘I also hope the people of Singapore, my adopted home, will forgive me over time.’

Mr Casey said he had been forced to leave the country because of threats to his family, but insisted: ‘Singapore is our home, and we hope to return.’

Death threats: British wealth manger Anton Casey and his wife, former Miss Singapore Bernice Wong

However,
 in a message posted on Facebook, Crossinvest Asia, a wealth management 
company, said: ‘The online comments made by Mr Casey do not represent 
the culture that we have built over many years.

'Accordingly, Crossinvest
 Asia and Mr Casey have parted ways with immediate effect.’

Mr Casey 
also faces possible prosecution if he returns to Singapore after a 
complaint of sedition was lodged with police. It is under investigation.

Mr Casey posted these updates on Facebook, which he later apologised for

The
 former colony is home to about 50,000 British expats. Many are hired by
 multinational banks on lucrative packages and are notorious for ‘Hoorah
 Henry’ antics.

A senior British banker, who has lived in Singapore 
for 15 years, said: ‘Casey is a pillock but unfortunately there are 
plenty of idiots like him with too much money and attitude.

‘The 
public mood is very ugly. All the major banks have given informal 
warnings to their expat staff  to cut back on the champagne and partying
 until this all blows over.’

Locals applauded his exit. On the Real 
Singapore blog, Jesse Loo wrote: ‘These kind of bigoted remarks cannot 
be tolerated anywhere.’
