Fatality: Carol Driver, a 61-year-old project manager, died on the D.C. metro system last night in a sea of smoke

This is the woman who died in a smoke-filled metro tunnel yesterday in Washington, D.C., after an electrical fire struck the subway system.

Carol Glover, 61, was the only fatality in the accident yesterday, which also hospitalized 84 people and terrified hundreds more travelers passing through the capital's L'Enfant Plaza station.

Glover, from Alexandria, Virginia, was a project manager for a communications company that does contract work for the federal government.

Twenty-one people were still in hospital Tuesday night. However, the metro system itself had been returned to full service.

According to Glover's LinkedIn profile, she had worked in the Beltway area for at least a decade, included stints at companies based in the Pentagon.

She was described as 'a vibrant woman, dedicated mother and loving person', by a neighbor speaking to local TV station WUSA9.

Officials in D.C. are yet to release her official cause of death, though witnesses from inside the metro carriage described a woman being overcome by smoke, despite commuters' efforts to revive her.

One, a member of the local transportation board, described how a woman passed out, and passengers then took turns giving her CPR.

He said he could not be sure it was Glover - but assumes it was as she is the only fatality.

Jonathan Rogers told WUSA: 'She passed out, it was obvious she passed out, and then people were taking her pulse and were like I don't feel anything.

'A few of us were rotating doing compressions, mouth to mouth, and we did it for like 20 minutes and eventually, it wasn't doing anything'.

Engulfed: Subway tunnels at L'Engatn Plaza were flooded with smoke after a major electrical fault Monday night

Choking: Commuters try to cope with the encroaching smoke, which sent 84 people to hospital after the fire was causing by arcing bursts of electricity

Accident investigators have said the fire was caused by 'electrical arcing' around a charged third rail on the subway.

In total 84 people had to go to hospital, and two people were critically injured, on top of Glover's death. Some passengers have said it took an hour for emergency crews to reach them. 

Electrical currents, which usually power the trains, can spread to unexpected places when the third rail comes into contact with something that conducts electricity, potentially starting fires.

The arcing in this case took place 335m ahead of the train, causing smoke to flood the tunnel from a point 240m to the south of l'Enfant Plaza, which led to the Pentagon.

The National Transportation Safety Board said that its investigation into the accident could take as long as a year.

Hard to breathe: Dozens of passengers were treated after breathing in the smoke whilst trapped underground

In a statement, Tom Downs, the chairman of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, apologized for the incident. He said that once the cause was determined, Metro was prepared to keep it from happening again.

The smoke near the L'Enfant Plaza station, a key transfer point for five Metro lines, also caused major disruptions on other lines.

Metro was running with delays on five of six lines on Tuesday.

The system, which operates in Washington as well as the Virginia and Maryland suburbs, is the second busiest nationally in terms of passengers carried, after New York's subway network.

The incident on Monday was the first on the Metro system involving a passenger death since a crash in June 2009 that killed eight riders and a train operator.
