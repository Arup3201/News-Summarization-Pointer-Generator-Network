Apple has overtaken Coca-Cola to become the world's most valuable brand, according to a report released today.

The crowning of the creator of the iPhone as the leading global brand is striking testimony to the increasing power of technology compared to traditional powerhouses such as car companies.

Google came second in the list compiled by consultancy Interbrand, with Coca-Cola, IBM and Microsoft rounding out the top five.

Coke, which has become an icon of 
globalisation and consumer society, has been top of the list every year 
since it was first published in 2000.

But
Apple's devotion to sleek design and Google's almost universal 
popularity as the world's top search engine helped them surpass the 
127-year-old drink for the first time.

Despite
the death of Apple's visionary founder Steve Jobs in 2011, the firm's 
brand value has continued to rise, according to Interbrand, soaring 28 
per cent in a year to reach $98.3billion.

Google's brand is worth $93.3billion - up 34 per cent on last year - with Coca-Cola worth $79.2billion.

When the Interbrand list debuted in 2000, Apple occupied 36th place with a brand value of $6.6billion - behind even the likes of Kodak.

But the introduction of the iPod, iPad and iPhone - which now accounts for one in 10 of all phones sold worldwide - has increased the value of its brand by more than 15 times.

Paying tribute to Apple's sucess, Interbrand CEO Jez Frampton said: 'Every so often, a company changes our lives - not just with its products, but with its ethos. This is why, following Coca-Cola’s 13-year run at the top of Best Global Brands, Apple now ranks #1.'

Not only does Apple have the world's best brand, it is also the most valuable company in the U.S., with a market capitalisation of more than $400billion.

Classic: Coke has long been an icon of globalisation and U.S. consumer culture

McDonald's, another firm considered to be an icon of American consumer culture, came in seventh on this year's list.

The only brands in the top 10 to come from outside the U.S. were Samsung, based in South Korea, and Japanese carmaker Toyota.

The top European brands were Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Louis Vuitton and H&M.

Among British firms, the most valuable 
brand is apparently HSBC, which occupied 32nd place on Interbrand's 
list, with Burberry, Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff the UK's only other 
contributions to the top 100.

Runner-up: Google came second in the list compiled every year by consultancy Interbrand

The fastest riser was Facebook, whose brand value increased by 43 per cent to propel it to no. 52 on the list.

By contrast, the value of Nokia's brand tumbled by two thirds in just one year after the firm was sold to Microsoft, taking it from 19th place to 57th.

The fall of Nokia, along with other tech firms such as Yahoo! and Blackberry, is a reminder that the value of brands can change rapidly in the volatile sector, implying that Apple and Google may not stay at the top for too long.

The total value of all the brands in Interbrand's top 100 came to $1.5trillion, 8.4 per cent higher than last year despite the continuing effects of the global financial crisis and subsequent recession.
