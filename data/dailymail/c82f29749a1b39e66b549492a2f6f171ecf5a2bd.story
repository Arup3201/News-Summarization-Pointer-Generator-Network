Tragic: Rose Medlock died after falling from her armchair at a residential home during a game of sit-down football

A frail pensioner who was moved into a care home for her own safety died after she broke six ribs when she fell from her chair during a game of football, an inquest heard.

Carers failed to spot Rose Medlock's injuries until the following morning when she was rushed to hospital.

However the 72-year-old died just weeks later as a result of the injury aggravating a lung condition, which caused pneumonia.

Today, her husband John, 85, of Foleshill, Coventry, said the care home should have treated his wife of 47 years sooner.

The inquest heard she fell from her armchair during a game of sit down football at Beechwood Gardens residential care home in Earlsdon, West Midlands.  

Rose had been moved into the home by social workers four months before the accident because they deemed her too weak to be cared at home her husband.

The inquest at Coventry Magistrate's Court on Friday ruled Rose died as a result of the fall on August 7, this year and recorded a verdict of accidental death. 

Mr Medlock, a retired musician who is partially sighted, said: 'It’s negligence. If she was at home with me, she’d still be alive. It’s shocking.

'Rose didn’t want to leave but social services said I couldn’t look after her because of my disabilities.

'They said she’d be best in the home, that she’d be there for at least 20 years and I could see her every day.

'She didn’t want to leave, she was insistent, but I thought it would be for the best.

'The reason they gave was that she had short term memory problems, I think they thought she had the onset of Alzheimer’s.

'But I didn’t think she did, she was just a day dreamer.

'They were scared she would fall down the stairs because our bedroom was upstairs.

'Social services forced her to move out of her own home claiming it was for her own good and she dies on her own four months later. I’m furious.'

The day after the fall, Rose was taken to University Hospital Coventry. She was discharged from hospital after three weeks but died just six days later on August 27.

Mr Medlock said: 'I don’t know much about the fall. All they told me was she was playing football and fell over.

'I think they were kicking a ball around from a sitting position. All I know is she fell over and they took her to hospital the next day.

'I love her and miss her so much. I want justice for Rose.

'I just want to make sure no one else goes through what I have.'

Care assistant at the home Alexandra Robertson, who was overseeing the ball game, told the inquest Rose collapsed on the floor after moving out of her armchair.

She said that after suffering the fall Rose 'sat up in the chair, laughing with the residents'.

She told the hearing they did check her body but there was only one small red mark and Rose 'wasn't in any pain'.

However, she said when Rose returned from hospital she was far weaker.

Ms Robertson said: 'She wasn’t the Rose that we knew before.

'She was happy to stay in bed and be cared for that way. She was kept comfortable and had regular visits.

'She wasn’t a big eater and had refused all her food.'

When asked about her injuries, care manager Joan Stubbs said: 'Accidents do happen as much as we try to stop them.'

Coroner Louise Hunt recorded a verdict of accidental death caused by bronchial pneumonia, fractured ribs and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

Speaking after the hearing, Rose’s sister Wynn Allen, 77, from Bedworth, said: 'I visited the Saturday before she died at the care home and she was all laid out, like she was ready to die, and she was gasping for every morsel of breath.

'She had nothing to eat and her mouth was open, it didn’t move. There was no need for that. There was no care. When she was with John she had everything she needed.'

The care home refused to comment today.
