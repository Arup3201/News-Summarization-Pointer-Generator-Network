Ever wondered what the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would look like if they lived in a parallel hipster universe? Ponder no more.

The royal couple have been given an edgy makeover by mixed media artist Cheyenne Randall - and we're loving the results.

Kate's long brunette waves have been jazzed up with an edgy purple tint and her arms covered with sailor-style tattoos, while Wills rocks heavy, geek-style spectacles, an asymmetric hairstyle and matching ink 'sleeves'.

Cheyenne Randall's website Shopped Tattoos also features Hollywood stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Grace Kelly and Star Trek's Spock with photo-shopped body art.

Randall says he tries to imagine 'what iconic figures would look like from a parallel universe'.

Cheyenne manages to make the tattoos not only look realistic - following bends and curves of the face and body - but also tailors them to suit their human canvasses.

Something about Marylin's polka-dot dress makes her painted lady appearance look intentionally rockabilly.

Pointy-eared and eyebrowed 
Spock already had the look of a body modification fan, so his inking looks rather in keeping with his style.

John Lennon looks a bit more biker than hippie with his sleeves, while butterfly tatts soften boxing legend Muhammad Ali's tough-guy image.

However Jackie Kennedy, Audrey Hepburn and Grace Kelly's adornments seems most at odds with their ladylike images

Imagine... what John Lennon would look like with full sleeves - more biker than hippie

First Lady Jackie Kennedy is perhaps the most unlikely figure to be seen with full sleeves and neck tattoos

Already a possible body-modification fan - look at those pointy ears and eyebrows! - Spock suits his full-body inking

Winona Ryder's shaggy hair style and sleeveless top suit mean Cheyenne's grungy additions look startlingly natural

Audrey Hepburn manages to make tattoos look classy - and Cheyenne manages to make the tattoos look realistic, following bends and curves of the face and body

Janet Leigh in Psycho sports a heart on her chest and a shoulder tattoo which reads 'slaughter' - oh the irony...
