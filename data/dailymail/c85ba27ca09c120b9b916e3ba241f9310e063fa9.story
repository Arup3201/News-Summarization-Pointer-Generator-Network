Making enemies: Alec Baldwin called movie producer Arki Busson a 'pockmarked toady' in a recent interview

Alec Baldwin has doled out yet another tongue lashing and this time the target of his ire is millionaire investor Arpad Busson.

The 30 Rock actor has taken umbrage with Busson, who recently announced a move into movie producing, after he claimed Baldwin was 'only a TV star'.

Baldwin told TV Guide: 'He’s a pockmarked toady who hops from 
yacht to yacht and bed to bed.

'So when some bloated little toad like 
Busson labels me a certain way, I say to myself, ''Consider the source.''

'If movie stardom meant being trapped on a yacht with Busson, I’d rather 
be a weatherman for Ch. 4 in New York.'

It appears that Baldwin crossed paths with Busson, who is the partner of Uma Thurman, in Cannes earlier this year.

Baldwin, 55, who is launching his own MSNBC talk show, also used the interview as an opportunity to air his grievances against Hollywood movie bosses, saying that they were clueless when it came to making films.

The actor said: 'They’re all factotums of multilateral corporations. It’s all money, money, money.'

However Baldwin did express admiration for Steven Spierlberg, adding: 'He doesn’t have to go to one of the douchebags from Warner Bros. and explain to them why his movie is marketable.'

Baldwin has been given his own Friday night TV talk show called Up Late With Alec Baldwin. It begins next month.

The rant is the latest from Baldwin, who recently became a father again to daughter Carmen with second wife, 29-year-old Hilaria. The actor also has a 17-year-old daughter Ireland with ex-wife Kim Basinger. 

Baldwin is known for his fiery outbursts. Last month he tackled a photographer in New York City who he believed had come too close to him and Hilaria while they were out for a stroll. The couple did not have their baby daughter with them at the time.

Photos of the scene appear to show the angry actor first warning off the male photographer then manhandling him over the hood of a parked car.

No charges were made against Baldwin or the photographer following the incident.

Age: 55

Origins: Born in Amityville, New York, he has three brothers and two sisters.

Relationship status: He is currently married to Hilaria, a 29-year-old yoga instructor. The couple married in 2012 and she gave birth to their first child, a daughter Carmen, in August.

He was previously married to Kim Basinger who he split from in an acrimonious divorce in 2002 after being married for nine years. The couple had a bitter custody battle over daughter Ireland, now a 17-year-old model.

Wealth: Estimated at $65million. Baldwin reportedly takes home $150,000 an episode for 30 Rock. He is the face of Capital One Bank for which he has publicly donated $10.5 million fees to various charities.

Controversy: The reputation of Baldwin's fiery temper often precedes him. He has had several run-ins with photographers, some ending in physical altercations.

In 2011, he was removed from a flight in LA because he would not stop playing a game on his phone for take-off.

In 2007, during his divorce battle with Kim Basinger, Baldwin left a voicemail for his daughter, calling her a 'rude, thoughtless little pig'. He later apologized.

Age: 50

Origins: Boulogne-Billancourt, France. He served as a medic in the French army before delving into the world of hedge funds in 1986. He is also known for his involvement in philanthropic causes around the world.

Relationship status: He is currently in a relationship with Uma Thurman, who gave birth to the couple's first child Rosalind Arusha Arkadina Altalune Florence Thurman-Busson, (known as Luna) in July 2012.

He was previously in a relationship with model Elle Macpherson from 1996 until 2005. The couple have two sons Arpad Flynn and Aurelius Cy Andrea.

Wealth: Busson had an estimated wealth of $200million this year, according to a French investment magazine.

Controversy: Arpad Busson reportedly made his first money as a toothpick salesman, a claim which the multimillionaire vehemently denies.

As a young man, he dated actress Farrah Fawcett, who was 16 years older than him, after meeting her on the French Riviera. 

The financier's EIM Group is believed to have been a victim of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme in 2008.

Fatherhood: Alec Baldwin and Arpad Busson have both embraced fatherhood again in their fifties

The actor has previously been involved in altercations with both 
reporters and photographers, and admits he struggles to deal with the 
interest in his private life.

Earlier this year the 30 Rock star told Gothamist: ‘The one element of 
culpability I have is I did let it get to me, and I have been 
confrontational with them [the press].’  

Back in February he allegedly told a 
reporter to 'choke to death' after she questioned him about a lawsuit 
involving his wife Hilaria's work as a yoga instructor.
