London Mayor Boris Johnson said European leaders should abandon 'hysterical' efforts to rescue the eurozone and recognise that some countries have to drop the single currency.

'I would be amazed if we were all sitting here next year and the euro had not undergone some sort of change,' he told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show.

'I think it highly likely that there will be a realignment in the sense that some countries will fall out... and we all know who the likely candidates are.

'But there is such phobia about this and such a lot of political ego has been invested in the success of the euro project that people are failing to see that might be the best way forward.

'If we continually go on with these hysterical attempts to bubble gum the whole thing together we are just going to consign those periphery economies particularly to low growth and we are never going to get confidence back in the eurozone.'

The senior Tory played down calls for an immediate referendum on UK membership of the EU - saying it would be required if there was a 'treaty change that substantially affects the UK'.

'There is no immediate reason as far as I can see to get embroiled in an in/out referendum,' he added.

Interviewing Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable, Mr Marr asked: 'Even Boris Johnson conceded or suggested that the use of the British veto, which he was in favour of... hadn’t actually put the City in a stronger position, or British financial services in a more protected position, is that what you think too?'

Mr Cable replied: 'That’s correct and Boris Johnson was right, as a matter of fact the position is unchanged.

'It was largely political, certainly the Prime Minister has got a short-term boost from it, but it doesn’t actually deal with the big long-term fundamental problems in Europe.'

Asked if he contemplated resignation at any time during the crisis over the EU veto, Mr Cable said 'No'.

He added: 'I frequently wonder about my position in Government because we’re all making difficult decisions, but when I reflect on it as I do, I realise that what we’re committed to is actually making this Government work, we’ve got to deal with the very serious problems in the economy.'

The comments came as David Cameron's hardline stance over the eurozone treaty appeared to have secured a significant boost in public opinion - as the Tories opened up a six-point poll lead over Labour.

A survey, conducted as the political fallout from his use of the UK’s veto at the Brussels summit convulsed the coalition, put the premier's party up two points with Labour dropping the same amount.

The 40 per cent to 34 per cent gap is among the biggest since the immediate aftermath of the 2010 general election and marks the highest Tory approval rating for more than 18 months.

Warning: Rating agency Fitch has told the European Central Bank to take a more active 'firefighting role'

The Liberal Democrats, whose MPs abstained en masse in protest at what they saw as a damaging outcome to single currency crisis talks, were unchanged on 14 per cent in the ICM/Sunday Telegraph poll.

It also suggested Mr Cameron could face growing demands for a referendum on the EU following his dramatic withdrawal from the deal agreed by most of the other member states last week.

A 58 per cent majority of those polled backed the move, with more than one in three (35 per cent) wanting a vote within a year.

As credit ratings agencies cast fresh doubt on efforts to end the euro crisis, it was reported that evacuating expats formed part of emergency plans being drawn up by the Foreign Office.

The Sunday Times said officials were concerned that around a million Britons living in Spain and Portugal could be trapped without access to cash if banks in the eurozone countries collapsed.

Preparing: Nick Clegg is getting ready to launch a fresh dig at Tory eurosceptics

It quoted officials saying the worst case scenario was being prepared for - with possible transport routes out and emergency loans among measures being examined.

A spokeswoman said: 'Officials continue to contingency plan for a range of possible scenarios.'

It came as Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg prepared to launch a fresh dig at Tory eurosceptics - criticising the influence of 'narrow nationalism' over 'enlightened internationalism'.

The Liberal Democrat leader will take to the TV studios for the second weekend in a row today as he battles to assert his party’s position after the difficulties caused by the euro row.

Yesterday he urged eurosceptics not to exploit the eurozone crisis to foster 'xenophobia, chauvinism and polarisation' as fresh doubts were cast on efforts to save the single currency.

Credit rating agency Fitch said it believed that a comprehensive solution was now 'technically and politically beyond reach' despite last week’s agreement on a rescue package.

Tory former chancellor Lord Lamont warned that time was running out to develop sufficiently strong measures to prevent the euro from a fatal 'explosion'.

In moves that will be closely watched by markets, Fitch put the ratings of six countries - Belgium, Spain, Slovenia, Italy, Ireland and Cyprus - under review.

It also dropped France's economic outlook from stable to negative - meaning it believes the country is more likely than not to lose its cherished AAA credit rating within two years.

Paris was delivered a diplomatic slap by the Deputy Prime Minister on Friday for 'simply unacceptable' attacks on the UK economy by a series of senior politicians and officials.

Its prime minister and central bank chief were among figures publicly suggesting the UK was a better candidate for any downgrade of its credit rating.

Mr Clegg has welcomed what he said were encouraging steps towards ensuring the UK was not isolated in Europe, including an agreement that British officials will take part in 'technical discussions' over the formation of the new rules on debt and deficit limits and a softening of opposition to the use of EU institutions in developing them.

The European Court of Justice will enforce what are meant to be strict central controls on the economies of participating member states.

Hungary and the Czech Republic have said they will not join the new agreement unless plans for tax harmonisation were dropped as signs of cracks among the other 26 nations appeared.

ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,008 adults by telephone on December 14-15 and the results were weighted to the profile of all adults.

It follows a YouGov poll for The Sun which gave the Tories a two-point lead over Labour and another by ComRes for The Independent poll putting the main parties neck-and-neck on 38 per cent.
