Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke has welcomed the return of Fernando Torres to his boyhood club.

Torres, 30, has agreed to join Atletico on loan from AC Milan until the end of the 2015-16 season and the move was confirmed on Monday.

And Koke believes the return of the club legend can help them in their bid to retain the Spanish title.

'It is very exciting for us to have Torres back,' said the 22-year-old Koke. 'This is still a player that can be one of the best strikers in the world when he is playing regularly.

'This is not a player we are signing at 35 or 36 - at 30 he is still at his peak - and Europe knows that when he is playing at his best that he is unstoppable.

Torres won the Champions League during his time at Chelsea, who he joined after Liverpool

'We want to defend our La Liga title. Real Madrid and Barcelona are playing well, but it is our dream to retain it - and we have to believe that is possible.

'It is signing players like Fernando that have won the World Cup and Champions League - that will go a long way to helping us achieve that goal.'
