If there is one thing I'm A Celebrity viewers have noticed this series it's that Melanie Sykes body really is a sight to behold. 

So fabulously toned is the 44-year-old mother-of-two that her rock hard six pack has been the talk of the show in and outside the camp.  

In an interview prior to her move to the jungle, Mel revealed her body isn't thanks to a get fit quick plan after signing up for the show.

'I've been training for seven years so I'm always bikini ready,' she said. 

Mel's trainer Chris Constantinou revealed that the secret to having a body like hers is you have to do a variety of exercises as well as sticking to a healthy diet.

He said: 'All too often people make the mistake of doing 100’s of crunches morning and night in the hope this will unearth the abs of Peter Andre in the 1990’s.'

Chris recommends a mixture of five different exercises. Starting with jumping sumo squats: 'These are similar to traditional jumping squats but with feet at a 45 degree angle to really work the inner thighs and gluts,' he explained.

Next try an 'own body weight push up with shoulder touch.' Chris said. 'This is a challenging twist to a push up, once at the top touch your shoulder with the opposing arm, giving a "Down, Up, Touch, Touch" rhythm.'

The third exercise that he recommends is jumping lunges: 'This will get your heart rate up as well and working the gluts and quads.'

Next he recommends core stability move 'the plank'. 

'Switch your weight between your forearms and the palms of the hands for the duration of the hold, this engages a greater number of the abdominals than a static plank,' he said. 

The final - and possibly most difficult exercise - that Chris recommends is burpees. 'Begin in a standing position. Feet shoulder-width apart, he explains. 'Lower your body into a squatting position, place hands on the floor in front of you. Kick feet back to be in a push-up position. 

'Lower chest to do a push-up. Bring chest back up. Kicking feet back to their original squat position. Stand up, and then jump into the air while reaching arms overhead. Repeat.'

But while these exercises will help you burn calories and become fitter and stronger, Chris said it's not the only thing that will give you a body like Mel's. 

He said: 'Remember, diet is as important as exercise. Avoid sugar dense food and drinks as this is known to sit on your midriff, it important to chose wisely post exercise to rehydrate and recover.'

He recommends drinks high in protein after exercise to help your muscles recover such as milk or his favourite, CocoPro, a high protein coconut water drink. 

Before heading into the jungle Mel revealed to OK! Magazine that she has been happy with her body for some time.  

However she did voice her concerns that she would lose weight thanks to the meagre jungle portions. 

'I'm going to lose weight and I don't want to - I like being athletic and fit, I don't like being slim. Eating just rice and beans, that's going to drive me mad,' she said.
