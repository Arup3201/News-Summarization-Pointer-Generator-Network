Richard Glatzer, 63, was taken to hospital near his Los Angeles home on Friday, his husband and collaborator on Still Alice, Wash Westmoreland, wrote in a Facebook message.

Mr Westmoreland posted: ''Not so glamorous but I wouldn't have it any other way. And Richard will be alive to see it.'

The couple married in September 2013. Mr Glatzer was diagnosed with degenerative ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease, in 2011.  

By the time production started on Still Alice, he'd lost his speech and the use of his arms.

Adapted from Lisa Genova's bestselling book, the tender and occasionally harrowing drama Still Alice tells the story of an accomplished Columbia University linguistics professor, Dr Alice Howard (played by Julianne Moore) who discovers that she has early onset Alzheimer's.

Moore has been nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award for her work. She has already been awarded a Golden Globe for her role and is a favorite to win the Oscar  - her first in five nominations - on February 22.

In an interview last month, Glatzer communicated by typing on an iPad with a toe on his right foot.

'I could still type with one finger on the iPad,' said Glatzer of the film shoot. 'It's so very important if you're struggling with a disease like this to feel you still matter. 

'It's ironic that in my deteriorated state, I'd be able to make a film that was creatively everything I'd ever wished for.'

The directors have partnered on three other films, The Last of Robin Hood in 2014, Quinceanera in 2006 and The Fluffer (2001). 

Julianne Moore has been nominated for an Academy Award for her role in movie Still Alice, where she plays a doctor with early on-set Alzheimer's
