Sitting proud and upright as he stares defiantly into the photographer's lens, this is one of the last images ever taken of the most famous Native American chief, Sitting Bull.

His picture is among 127 rare images collected by English adventurer Charles Alston Messiter through the latter third of the 19th century, about to go under the hammer.

A moving and intimate window into a way of life almost completely wiped out by the modern world, the collection reveals an ancient culture in transition.

Dry-plate photography made it possible for photographers to go into the wilds of native USA and document everyday life.

The iconic portrait of Sitting Bull was taken eight years after his legendary victory over General Custer at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1886.

In a bloody battle that would be seared into folklore, the chief led a united force comprising Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho Native American warriors to defend their camp against an invasion by the U.S. army.

Custer launched a three-pronged attack against Little Bighorn, but was cut off and surrounded by Sitting Bull's larger army leading to a stand off that became known as Custer's Last Stand. Custer and all his troops subsequently lost their lives. 

Little Bighorn also is, to some Native Americans, as the Battle of the Greasy Grass.

The United States prevailed in the Indian Wars, but Sitting Bull became, and remains, a hero to his people. Later in his life, he may have taken up -- the point is disputed -- the 'ghost dance' movement, which foretold that dead Indians would return to life and that white domination would end.

This spooked U.S. authorities. They went after Sitting Bull, who had settled back at Standing Rock. He was killed in a battle with Native American police and U.S. soldiers on June 15, 1890.

According to the Library of Congress' website: 'When European settlers arrived on the North American continent at the end of the fifteenth century, they encountered diverse Native American cultures—as many as 900,000 inhabitants with over 300 different languages'

'These people, whose ancestors crossed the land bridge from Asia in what may be considered the first North American immigration, were virtually destroyed by the subsequent immigration that created the United States. 

'This tragedy is the direct result of treaties, written and broken by foreign governments, of warfare, and of forced assimilation.'
