Fresh calls have been made to quash a death penalty handed out to a double killer because the jury in his trial was told black men were more violent.

Duane Buck, 51, was convicted in Texas of killing his ex-girlfriend and a man in her apartment in July 1995 and has been on death row since.

While his guilt is not being questioned, Buck's lawyers say the jury was unfairly influenced and that he should 
receive a new sentencing hearing.

In 2011, Buck's attorneys appealed to the Supreme 
Court and Texas Governor Rick Perry to block the execution, saying a 
psychologist testified that black people were more likely to commit 
violence.

Psychologist Dr Walter Quijano, 
who had been called by Buck's defense lawyer to testify about his future
threat to society, testified to this under cross-examination by the 
prosecutor.

He was asked: 
'You have determined that the sex factor, that a male is more violent 
than a female because that’s just the way it is, and that the race 
factor, black increases the future dangerousness for various complicated
reasons; is that correct?'

Dr Quijano said: 'Yes.'

The Supreme Court halted the execution and the justices said they would review an appeal in his case.

In a new documentary on the case, Christana Swarns, director of the 
criminal justice project for the NAACP legal defense fund, said: 'It’s a stunning and outrageous case.

'You have someone condemned to die because he is African American.'

Buck's
case is one of six convictions that then Texas Attorney General John 
Cornyn - a political ally of Perry who is now a Republican U.S. senator -
reviewed in 2000 and said needed to be reopened because of the racial 
reference.

In the other five cases, new punishment hearings were held and each convict again was sentenced to die.

State attorneys contend Buck's case was different from the others and that the racial reference was a small part of larger testimony about prison populations.

Perry is a capital punishment supporter and as frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination his actions now are coming under closer scrutiny.

The reprieve from the nation's highest court came nearly two hours into a six-hour window when Buck could have been taken to the death chamber.

Buck was convicted of gunning down ex-girlfriend Debra Gardner, 32, and Kenneth Butler, 33, outside Houston on July, 30, 1995, a week after Buck and Gardner broke up.

A third person, Buck's stepsister, Phyllis Taylor, also was wounded, though she has since forgiven Buck and sought for his death sentence to be commuted to life in prison.

Buck's attorneys went to the Supreme Court after losing appeals in lower courts.A clemency request to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, all of whom are Perry appointees, also failed.

Now former Governor Mark White, prosecutor in the case Linda Geffin, members of the Texas legislature and retired prosecutors and judges are petitioning the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals for a new sentencing hearing.

Mr White has also narrated a new documentary on the case called A Broken Promise in Texas: Race, the Death Penalty and the Duane Black Case.
