Florists compared incorporating pot to a lover giving chocolate or wine

'You can't do a lot because the smell is so overwhelming. It's more of a little accent here and there,' Cind Olig of Perfect Petal in Denver told WTSP. 

Olig compared incorporating pot to a lover giving chocolate or wine, noting that she'd even done marijuana arrangements for summer weddings of pot dispensary owners.

'They have great budgets and wanted to give a nod to their business,' she joked.

The customer must provide the pot themselves as well as picking up the completed arrangements by themselves

Ever since the Denver Post wrote about her offer, she says she's been flooded with business.

Some caveats: the customer must provide the pot themselves as well as picking up the completed arrangements by themselves.

Another florist, Bud & Blossoms is also making marijuana arrangements.

The company encourages customers 'you can take the buds from your bouquet or 'budonniere' and put in straight into your bowl.'
