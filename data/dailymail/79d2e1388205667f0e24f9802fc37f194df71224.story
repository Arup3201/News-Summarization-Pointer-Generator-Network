Derek Fisher is one of the most decorated players the NBA has seen over the last two decades, but this year he has learned that coaching is a whole different ball game.

After winning five NBA titles with the Los Angeles Lakers, Fisher called time on his illustrious playing career and is now in his rookie year as New York Knicks head coach.

But the 2014-15 season has been a reality check for coach Fisher, and his Knicks side travel to England with just five wins from a miserable first half of the campaign.

‘Our record is not where we would like it to be for sure, but we are in the process of restructuring and retooling the New York Knicks.’ Fisher said at the team’s practice facility in Tarrytown last week.

‘We are going to play a new brand of basketball and we are going to represent this city and organisation in a different way. The wins and losses don’t represent it right now, but we are making progress, we are changing out habits, we are building a new culture and we believe we are going to get there.’

Fisher’s calm persona, optimism and belief that his team will eventually get it right cannot hide the fact that this is a completely different Knicks side to the one that travelled to London two years ago.

On that occasion, a New York team featuring Carmelo Anthony at his peak as well as the likes of Tyson Chandler, JR Smith and Jason Kidd proved far too strong for the Detroit Pistons in a 102-87 victory.

The Knicks finished second behind the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference standings that year, and fell in the East semi-finals to the Indiana Pacers.

This year, though, they travel to London on a 15-game losing streak and with the unwanted tag of being the worst Knicks team in history.

‘It has been challenging,’ Fisher said. ‘We have asked these players to play a new style of basketball and to approach their job in a different way. When you’re asking somebody to try something new and they’re not getting positive feedback it is difficult to keep going.

‘It has tested our faith and our trust in each other, but we are forging relationships as men. Nobody likes to lose, but these guys are working hard everyday and there are still a lot of positive things going on even in the face of our struggles right now.

‘We have really had to make sure our guys remain diligent in their habits and focus on the process as opposed to the results. If you focus on the process and the habits then the results will start to take care of themselves.

‘The losses just represent the fact that we are not at where we need to be yet, but it doesn’t mean that we are going to give up on what we are trying to do.' 

The Knicks have only won one of their last 26 games and all but given up on their season

Injuries haven’t helped the Knicks, but a trade last week that sent Smith and Iman Shumpert to the Cleveland Cavaliers for very little in return was effectively a surrender of their season.

In making the trade the Knicks have at least cleared some cap space for free agency in the summer, but their fans can expect many more losses this season.

Fisher, though, is not giving up on his future goals with New York and believes that they will start winning games by playing his brand of basketball.

‘While I was playing, I always believed the game should be played a certain way,' he said. 'As a young kid, the way I was coached and taught to play basketball, it was as a team with all five guys contributing on the floor and guys on the bench supporting their team-mates.

‘You dribbled the basketball with a purpose and passed with a purpose. No matter what system I decided to run, it was going to be with that in mind that basketball truly is a team game and that’s how I want my teams to play on both ends of the floor.

Fisher is optimistic that the Knicks will be a force again once he implements his brand of basketball

‘I feel that my experience and my belief in the way that basketball should be played over the course of my lifetime is going to bode well for me and help me going forward.

‘We have a wonderful coaching staff with a world of championship experience and Phil Jackson as the president of our team is a great resource. It gives me a lot of confidence that I have plenty of support and resources as to how to continue to find ways to try and push the right buttons for our team.’

A trip across the Atlantic away from the spotlight may be just what the Knicks need right now, but on Thursday they will come up against a Milwaukee Bucks team that has beaten them twice already this season.

‘Sometimes a road trip for a team is a good thing,’ Fisher said. ‘On the road, it is just you and your team and so there is a different level of brotherhood and togetherness that starts to happen.

Fisher won five NBA titles as a player with the Los Angeles Lakers during his long career

‘Hopefully while we are in the UK we can take advantage of the fact that we are a band of brothers going over to represent New York and represent the league and have a good time while we work hard.

‘We understand the responsibilities that come with representing the NBA overall and not only is it a regular-season game that means something on our schedule, but it is also an opportunity to grow the game and give people in the UK a special experience.

‘It is a gift to be able to go there and so we want to represent our team and organisation well. We also have to respect the fact that that UK is rolling out the red carpet for us to come in and so we should spend a certain amount of time in the community and make sure we are touching people and enjoying our time while we are there.’
