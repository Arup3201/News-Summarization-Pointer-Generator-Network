That's no costume, those are the polar bears that caused the small town of Cape Churchill in Manitoba, Canada, to cancel Halloween.

After polar bears were spotted lumbering across the frozen tundra, children were banned from going outdoors to trick or treat on Halloween night due to fears that the bears could attack.

The small town of Churchill has a population of just over 800, and is known as the 'polar bear capital of the world.'

Town children weren't able to go trick or treating on Halloween night for fear of bear attacks

Believe it or not, this isn't the first Canadian town that's been forced to cancel trick or treating because of these furry visitors.

Though in the summer polar bears remain inland to hibernate, when autumn wanes, they are known to assemble on the shores of Hudson Bay to prepare for the water to freeze over. 

And sure enough - further along the western shore of the bay, about 260 km north of Churchill, the remote village of Arviat, Nunavut, was likewise forced to host an alternative, indoor Halloween celebration in order to 'prevent tragedy.'

Arviat Senior Administrative Officer Steve England told CBC News that, being in the middle of polar bear season, it was their only real option.

'We're just trying to safeguard the younger population by offering an alternative,' he said.

There are about 2,300 people in the town and 1,300 are children.
