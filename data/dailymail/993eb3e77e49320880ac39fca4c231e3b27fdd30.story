A dramatic emergency operation was launched at Heathrow airport yesterday after members of a British children’s choir fell ill on a flight.

Specially trained paramedics met the Emirates plane and ambulances waited on the tarmac amid fears that dozens of youngsters were unwell.

A parent described children going ‘down like nine pins’ as the mystery illness struck while flight EK007 was in the air.

The children complained of feeling ill on the flight from Cape Town yesterday morning

The children aged between 10 and 14 started vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea during the flight

Crew
 on the Airbus A380 alerted emergency services after several of the 
youngsters, aged ten to 14, began vomiting during the seven-hour final 
leg of their flight home from South Africa, via Dubai.

Four ambulances 
and a ‘hazardous area response team’ – trained to provide life-saving 
medical care following natural disasters or industrial accidents – were 
sent to meet the flight.

Around
 60 youngsters were checked by paramedics and 12 were taken to hospital 
but released within hours after being treated for stomach upsets.

Choir member Tanwen Cray, 13, said: ‘It happened very quickly. Suddenly there were about 30 people around me being sick.

Last
 week Public Health England warned people on a British Airways flight 
from Saudi Arabia to contact the NHS if they felt unwell, after a 
passenger was diagnosed with Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers). 
The illness has killed more than 100 people in the last two years.

There
 is no suggestion the children’s choir or other passengers on the Dubai 
flight were exposed to Mers, part of the coronavirus family that 
includes the common cold and Sars, or severe acute respiratory syndrome.

A
 Public Health Wales spokesman said the children were thought to have 
viral gastroenteritis, which is also known as stomach flu.

Tanwen Cray, 13, left, said cabin crew were busy handing out sick bags, while her sister Efa, right, described the trip as 'fantastic' apart from the trip home

‘The
 air stewardesses were running around giving people sick bags as quick 
as they could. There were a lot of queues for the toilets and we were 
all a bit queasy. I don’t know what caused it but it was a long journey 
and a bit bumpy. A lot of people were ill very quickly.’

Tanwen
 said she and her sister Efa, 11, were taken ill and she underwent three
 hours of tests at Hillingdon Hospital, west London.

The
 children from Welsh choir Only Kids Aloud were returning home from 
performing in Cape Town with world-renowned opera star Bryn Terfel.

They
 were said to have recovered quickly after receiving treatment at 
Hillingdon Hospital. Last night, the choir returned to Wales.

Bet
 Davies of the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff, where the choir is 
based, said the children were checked by paramedics ‘as a precaution to 
make sure they weren’t bringing an infection into the country’.

She
 said: ‘They were on a massive high after performing but on the flight 
home some of them fell sick and were running to the toilet. There had been a bit of turbulence and some of the children had never flown before.

The children performed at two sold-out performances at Cape Town Opera House on Friday and Saturday night

They performed a new choral work, Spirit of 
Peace, by composer Paul Mealor, at two sell-out concerts on Friday and 
Saturday.

The events were organised to mark the 20th anniversary of the 
end of apartheid in South Africa.

The choir, which includes children from across Wales, has also performed at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.

London Ambulance Service said it spent almost two hours at Heathrow, checking and treating around 60 children.

It is believed that 60 of the 65 members of the Only Kids Aloud choir, pictured, were struck down with some form of food poisoning as they flew on the final leg of their journey from South Africa

‘Some
 were sick on take-off, some on landing and some during turbulence, so 
because of the rules in the airline industry – we were travelling with 
Emirates – they say if more than three children are sick on the same 
flight you need to have paramedics in to check on the children.

'We were 
also anxious that they were checked out before travelling back to Wales 
as we have a duty of care towards them.’

The
 65-strong choir flew to South Africa last week for two performances at 
Cape Town’s Artscape Theatre Centre, with Cape Town Opera’s chorus and 
bass baritone Mr Terfel.

An eyewitness on Twitter said some of the children were 'seriously ill'

Dr
 Judy Hart, a consultant in communicable disease control for Public 
Health Wales, said: ‘A few members of the Only Kids Aloud choir have 
returned from their trip to South Africa with symptoms of vomiting and 
diarrhoea.

‘Information so 
far indicates that this is probably viral gastroenteritis.

All the 
children have now recovered and returned to their homes across Wales.’
