Right down to the thick-rimmed glasses, expressions and perfect comic timing, the likeness is uncanny.

And if it weren’t for the fact that Morecambe and Wise are sadly no longer with us, these two men would surely pass for them every single time.

Jonty Stephens and Ian Ashpitel have been given the daunting task of ‘resurrecting’ Britain’s best-loved comedy duo for this month’s Edinburgh Festival.

Those who have seen them in action are astonished that they not only look and sound identical to the twosome, but their mannerisms and delivery are also spot on.

Their show, Eric and Little Ern, re-enacts the finest moments during their 42-year partnership, which ended with Eric Morecambe’s death in 1984.

It is set in 1999, when Ernie Wise is close to death in hospital after having two heart attacks while on holiday.

While he dozes, a white-coated doctor walks in - and turns out to be none other than the spirit of his old pal Eric.

Somehow, he manages to coax ‘little Ern’ off his sickbed and into a re-enactment of some of their finest showbiz moments.

The show, written and performed by Stephens and Ashpitel, aims to bring to life the ‘feel, look and sound’ of an evening with Eric and Ernie.

It combines much-loved sketches with additional original material by scriptwriters Eddie Braben, Sid Green and Dick Hills as well as some biographical details.

Highlights: Morecambe and Wise cosy up to actress Penelope Keith. The show recreates their greatest comedy moments in a series of flashbacks from Ernie Wise's death bed

Chemistry: Their talent and affection for each other jumped off the screen, whether it was dressing up with Glenda Jackson (left) or acting the fool in the opening gambit to their show (right)

Ashpitel and Stephens say their own friendship, spanning back several decades, helps them recreate the chemistry of that incomparable duo.

They also suggest it helps that Ashpitel, who plays Wise, ‘just happens to have short, fat, hairy legs’.

The pair first met at drama school 30 years ago and recently created this show from a shorter, after-dinner sketch they were already performing.

Individually they have a wide variety of stage and television credits ranging from BBC drama to Shakespeare’s Globe.

Morecambe and Wise met as teenagers in 1941 and took part in a series of children’s variety performances before launching as a comedy duo.

In 2000, The Morecambe and Wise Show was voted 14th in a list of the Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute.

The two were honoured with a blue plaque at Teddington studios, where much of their best work was shot, in 2013.

Eric and Little Em is showing at Edinburgh’s Gilded Balloon until August 26.
