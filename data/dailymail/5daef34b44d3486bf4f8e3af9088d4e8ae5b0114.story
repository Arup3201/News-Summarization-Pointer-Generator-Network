Iranian authorities are planning to sue Hollywood over the Oscar-winning movie Argo because of its 'unrealistic portrayal' of the country, according to local media.

Several news outlets, including the 
pro-reform Shargh daily, said today that French lawyer Isabelle 
Coutant-Peyre is in Iran for talks with officials over how and where to 
file the lawsuit.

Ms Coutant-Peyre is also the lawyer for notorious Venezuelan-born terrorist Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, known as Carlos the Jackal.

Iranian authorities plan to sue Hollywood over its 'unrealistic portrayal' of the country, according to reports

Argo's portrayal of the escape of five hostages from Iran has been dismissed as 'CIA propaganda'

The
 decision on the lawsuit reportedly came after a group of Iranian cultural 
officials and movie critics screened the film in a closed audience in a 
Tehran cinema late last night.

Argo, which won the Best Picture Oscar this year, tells the story of the escape of six American hostages from the besieged U.S Embassy in Tehran in 1979.

The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance met for a one-day conference called 'The Hoax of Hollywood' on Monday night, according to the Tehran Times.

It said the 'distortion of historical facts' in films including 300 and Argo prompted them to meet.

Conference secretary Mohammad Lesani was quoted as saying: 'One of the main aims of the meeting is to unify all cultural communities in Iran against the attacks of the West, particularly Hollywood.'

The website also reported that the conference intends to send a statement to the Human Rights Council on the matter.

French lawyer Isabelle Coutant-Peyre who has represented Carlos the Jackal, will reportedly represent the Iranian authorities in its lawsuit against Argo, which won the Best Picture Oscar at the Academy Awards

Last month Iranian officials dismissed Argo as pro-CIA, anti-Iran propaganda and state television called it an 'advertisement for the CIA'.

The semiofficial Mehr news agency called the Academy Award 'politically
 motivated' because Michelle Obama helped present the award.

Mohammed Hosseini, Iran's Culture Minister, described the film as a 'distorted history'.

Argo has been banned from Iranian cinemas, but bootleg copies are believed to be available.

Hundreds of Iranian students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran before taking dozens of staff hostage

The American hostages, who were paraded in front of cameras  blindfolded and tied up, were held captive for 444 days from November 4, 1979 to January 20, 1981

The hostage crisis began on November 4, 1979 when militants calling themselves Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line stormed the embassy in Tehran.

Five members of staff managed to escape by a side exit but the remaining 55 staff members were held captive for a further 444 days.

The storming of the embassy was a result of mounting hostility against the U.S. after the exiled Shah of Iran was allowed to enter the America for cancer treatment

Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was installed and supported by both the U.S. and the UK governments but his rule was overthrown shortly after his exile in January 1979 and replaced with an Islamic republic.
