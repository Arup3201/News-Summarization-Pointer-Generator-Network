A 4,000 tonne silo building was left resembling the Tower of Pisa after an explosion meant to bring it to the ground left it mainly intact and leaning to one side.

Demolition experts were left a little red-faced after they miscalculated the implosion of the silo in Redbank, Australia. 

Big bang: Demolition experts set off 100kg of explosives to implode a 4,000 tonne silo in Redbank, Australia

Going, going... not gone: But the explosives fail to destroy the top half of the building, leaving it leaning on one side

Workers used 100kg of explosives in the controlled explosion, but it was not enough to bring down the building.

The structure remained largely intact and was left looking like Italy's most famous leaning tower for 40 minutes until excavators arrived to push the rest of the building over.

Workers were left with a big clean-up operation after much of the building was left collapsed in large chunks instead of the intended rubble.

Got there eventually: Excavators were brought in after 40 minutes to push the remaining building over

Reduced to rubble, sort of: Workers were left with a big clean-up operation after much of the building was left collapsed in large chunks
