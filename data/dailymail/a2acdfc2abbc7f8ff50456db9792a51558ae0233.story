Twitter’s chief executive has taken personal responsibility for the social media website’s problems in dealing with abuse reported by users.

Dick Costolo admitted that Twitter ‘sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls’ in an internal memo seen by The Verge.

In it, he said that he is embarrassed by the way the company handles abuse and that it must take stronger action in the future.

Twitter chief executive Dick Costolo has accepted the blame for the social media site's failure to tackle online abuse. He said: 'We suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we’ve sucked at it for years'

Mr Costolo said: ‘We suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we’ve sucked at it for years.

‘It’s no secret and the rest of the world talks about it every day. We lose core user after core user by not addressing simple trolling issues that they face every day.

‘I’m frankly ashamed of how poorly we’ve dealt with this issue during my tenure as CEO. It’s absurd. There’s no excuse for it.

‘I take full responsibility for not being more aggressive on this front. It’s nobody else’s fault but mine, and it’s embarrassing.’

Mr Costolo’s comments were posted on an internal forum among Twitter employees, after one employee raised the question of what more could be done to tackle online abuse in the wake of writer Lindy West speaking to the Guardian about her experiences. 

In recent years Twitter has come under fire for failing to protect its users from trolls. Robin Williams’ daughter, Zelda Williams, left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father’s death. She made an appeal to her 166,000 followers to report two users on Twitter (shown above)

She received comments and abuse on a daily basis. Internet trolls even created a Twitter account in the name of her deceased father in order to send insults to her.

Mr Costolo said: ‘We’re going to start kicking these people off right and left and making sure that when they issue their ridiculous attacks, nobody hears them. Everybody on the leadership team knows this is vital.’

Stories of abuse, threats and internet trolls have become commonplace on Twitter in recent years. 

In the UK, journalist Caroline Criado-Perez (pictured) received rape threats after she voiced her support for the campaign to introduce Jane Austen as the new face of the £10 note 

Robin Williams’ daughter, Zelda Williams, left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father’s suicide.

Feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian was threatened with rape, sexual violence and death by Twitter trolls during the 'Gamergate' saga after she criticised the way women are portrayed in video games.

In the UK, journalist Caroline Criado-Perez also received rape threats after she voiced her support for the campaign to introduce Jane Austen as the new face of the £10 note.

Twitter users Isabella Sorley and John Nimmo admitted sending the messages to Ms Criado-Perez and both were jailed last year.

Many people believe that Twitter is still not doing enough to tackle trolls.

In December, the social platform made the task of reporting abuse easier.

Its update saw the process streamlined so there are fewer steps required in order to report abuse.

It used to require filling in a nine-part questionnaire but trolls can now be reported in a few steps.

Twitter has said that more tools are on the way to further improve the service.

Mr Costolo said: ‘Let me be very, very clear about my response here - I take personal responsibility for our failure to deal with this as a company.

‘I thought I did that in my note, so let me reiterate what I said, which is that I take personal responsibility for this. I specifically said “It’s nobody’s fault but mine”.

‘We have to be able to tell each other the truth, and the truth that everybody in the world knows is that we have not effectively dealt with this problem even remotely to the degree we should have by now, and that’s on me and nobody else.

‘So now we’re going to fix it, and I’m going to take full responsibility for making sure that the people working night and day on this have the resources they need to address the issue, that there are clear lines of responsibility and accountability, and that we don’t equivocate in our decisions and choices.’

Ms Criado-Perez took to Twitter this morning to agree with Mr Costolo that Twitter ‘sucks’ at dealing with abuse, before adding that it was ‘good to see an acknowledgement tho (sic)’.

‘And to be fair to Twitter, I know they’ve been working hard on finding solutions to the problem’, she added.

Under the Malicious Communications Act 1988, any 'indecent or grossly offensive' message that causes 'distress or anxiety' to the recipient can lead to prosecution.

The maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level four on the standard scale - i.e. no more than £2,500.

Since the 1988 law came into force before the widespread use of the internet, e-mail and social networking, prosecutors have used a number of different laws to charge Twitter trolls.

Student Liam Stacey, who sent a series of racially abusive tweets after footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed, was charged under the Crime and Disorder Act.

Two men jailed for inciting riots last summer were found guilty under the Serious Crime Act, and Paul Chambers, who joked he would blow Doncaster airport 'sky high' was charged under the Communications Act 2003.
