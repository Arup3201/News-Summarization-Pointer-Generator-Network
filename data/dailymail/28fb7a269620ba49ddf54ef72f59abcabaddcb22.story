He was seen in the water in Sutton Harbour, Plymouth, trapped between an old fishing boat and a harbour wall

The man was being chased by officers after they were called out to reports of a theft of a bicycle, Devon and Cornwall Police said

Police officers and firemen desperately tried to get to him but were unable to do so in time.

Royal Navy divers later recovered his body, which the police are yet to identify.

They also recovered the bicycle but it is not clear whether he rode it into the harbour. 

A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman said: 'Police were called to reports of the theft of a bicycle from Citadel Road East in Plymouth around 6.10am.

The man was seen by members of the public to enter the water close to The China House pub around 6.30am. 

'He became trapped between a disused fishing vessel and the harbour wall.

'Two lifeboats and the fire service water rescue team were deployed but were unable to reach the man due to his location.'

It is believed that the flood gate at Sutton Harbour had been closed to prevent water levels rising

Police said they had referred the death to the Independent Police Complaints Commission - standard practice when someone dies after involvement with officers.

A woman who was at the harbour at around 5.50am this morning saw the commotion and said: 'I noticed the cop cars turn up shortly after I got here and then there were police all around the China House.

'Then there were some police officers stood on the harbour and I offered my assistance and he said they had reports someone jumping in the harbour.

'I think he swam round and got himself trapped between the wreck and the wall.

'I came back at about 6.45am and they had found him between the boat and the wall and you could hear him shouting.'

The woman said she could hear a man's voice shouting 'I can't swim' before she was asked by police to move away. 

It is believed that the flood gate at Sutton Harbour had been closed to prevent water levels rising.
