Liverpool are set to give their fans a much-needed boost by agreeing a new £25million deal with Raheem Sterling by the end of the month.

The Anfield club are confident of securing Sterling on a five-year contract worth £100,000-a-week and have stepped up negotiations with the 20-year-old England international following the surprise news that captain Steven Gerrard will leave at the end of the season to play in America.

Manager Brendan Rodgers is pinning his hopes on Sterling becoming the club’s new talisman and even though the England star has two years left on his current deal, Liverpool are keen to reward him for his outstanding form and want to ward off £60m interest from Real Madrid and Manchester City.

‘It was always the club’s intention to show Raheem how much we value him and the belief is the new contract will be in place by the end of the month,’ said a source.

Sterling, who signed for Liverpool from QPR as a 15-year-old in 2010, was England’s best player at last summer’s World Cup and has overcome accusations of being tired to play at centre-forward due to an injury to Daniel Sturridge.
