London Welsh captain Tom May and Irish replacement Dan Leo were sent off as Welsh went down to their 11th league defeat.

May lashed out with a swinging elbow and though Leo initially appeared to be defending himself, having grappled May to the floor he punched the opposition centre.

Welsh head coach Justin Burnell was frustrated that a game which was close for a long time slid away from his side in the second half.

He said: ‘We are bitterly disappointed because at certain stages, I thought we could win. We were in contention at half-time and at 17-9 down midway through the second half we were still well in the game.’

Welsh battled harder than in recent weeks but tries from Tom Court, Geoff Cross and Alex Lewington rewarded a dominant Irish pack. 

Tom Homer converted all three and kicked a penalty, with three penalties from Will Robinson being the only response from the visitors.

Such was the dominance of the home eight that they should have picked up a bonus point, which their director of rugby, Brian Smith, accepted.

He said: ‘I am relieved but I have mixed emotions as with 10 minutes left I thought we could have squeezed out a bonus point. The win was obtained purely on the back of our forwards but you could see how difficult conditions were as it was raining heavily and the pitch was very slippy.’

The major talking point was the double dismissal of May and Leo in the 34th minute.

Burnell said: ‘We saw the incident involving (Northampton hooker) Dylan Hartley last week and there is obviously a similarity for the referee to consider.

‘Tom is distraught as it’s probably the first time in his career that he’s been dismissed and he feels he’s let his team-mates down.’

Smith also alluded to the Hartley incident, saying: ‘It certainly shone a light so the match officials had to make a call based on that. As a result the offence became topical but the issuing of cards needs to be proportional. Dan is very upset and not a thug so we will be strongly defending our boy as we believe he may have been hard done by.’

The first Irish try came after 29 minutes when a chip ahead by Shane Geraghty should have been dealt with by the visitors’ defence but a favourable bounce saw Fergus Mulchrone collect to send in Lewington.

Robinson kicked his second penalty for Welsh but the hosts looked to have extended their lead when another chip from Geraghty was pounced upon by Topsy Ojo for the wing to touch down. However, the replay showed Ojo to have been just in front of the kicker so the TMO ruled no try, leaving Irish with a 10-6 lead at the interval.

The Irish pack continued to dominate after the break and were rewarded when prop Cross forced his way over from close range.

Robinson kicked his third penalty to make it 17-9 at the end of the third quarter but Irish clinched victory when Court finished off a line-out drive to ensure Welsh remain winless and slipping ever closer to relegation.
