These cadets make rugby players look like wimps as they battle it out for pole position in one of the world's toughest sports.

The recruits at Japan's National Defence Academy marked the 60th anniversary of its foundation today with a traditional game of Botaoshi.

The brutal sport involves two teams of up to 150 people attempting to topple their opponents' flag pole using any means necessary.

Last line of defence: A player kicks out in a last ditch attempt to hold onto his team's flag pole

Botaoshi, which translates from Japanese as 'pull down a pole', is played every year at the academy in Yokosuka, south of Tokyo on its foundation day.

It is meant to demonstrate the cadet's physical strength, operational capability and teamwork, with the four teams competing for the victory trophy in front of a delighted public.

A favoured strategy is for players to clamber on top of teammates and run on their backs, before launching themselves at the opposition's pole.

Defending teams usually position a player on the top of the pole as a last line of defence - kicking and punching any opponent who gets too close.
