Rail crossing crash victim Thomas Pizzey was described as 'a kind, generous and gentle man'

A man who was killed when a car was hit by a freight train on a rural level crossing was named by police today as 85-year-old Thomas Pizzey.

Mr Pizzey, from Banbury in Oxfordshire, was a passenger in a blue Renault Kangoo that was hit at a crossing in Sandy Lane near Yarnton, north of Oxford, yesterday afternoon.

In a statement released by British Transport Police, his niece Linda Mogford said: 'My Uncle Tom was a kind, generous and gentle man and this incident has come as a great shock to all the family.

'We would like to thank everyone for 
their kind messages of support at this very difficult and sad time and 
extend our sympathies to those who knew Tom in Banbury.

'He will be greatly missed by his 
family and those who loved him and we would ask for privacy to grieve 
and come to terms with our loss.'

The driver of the car, a 78-year-old man, is in a stable condition in Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital, BTP added.

Police, firefighters and paramedics 
rushed to the scene at 3.40pm after the fright train driver radioed his 
control room and told his controllers that he had struck a car on a 
level crossing.

The driver of the freight train, en 
route from Trafford Park in Greater Manchester to Southampton, was 
'shaken but uninjured', British Transport Police said.

The
crash happened on a rural crossing in a quiet country lane which was 
reportedly due to be visited by a new speed camera van designed to catch
people who attempt to beat barriers before they come down.

The Oxford Mail newspaper reported 
last month that British Transport Police were rolling out the 
purpose-built van to crossings in the county where drivers are known to 
gamble on beating the warning signals and barriers to get across before 
the train arrives.

It would then collect video evidence for prosecutions. The paper reported that Sandy Lane was one of those due to be visited.

A spokesperson for British Transport Police said it is not clear at the moment why the car was on the level crossing

Network Rail said that the crossing in Sandy Lane was in full working order before the crash.

A spokesperson said it was working with BTP to determine how the accident happened.

'The level crossing was in full working order beforehand,' she said.

'The lights were working and the barriers. That is part of the investigation so we will be looking at that. There is nothing to suggest it was not working beforehand.'

She
said there had been a problem at the crossing a year ago, with the 
barrier rising and falling slowly, but it had been fixed when a treadle,
which operates the crossing when triggered by an approaching train, was
replaced.
