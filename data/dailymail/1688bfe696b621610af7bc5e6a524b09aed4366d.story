Mayweather's fight with Pacquiao is being billed as the biggest fight in history and there had been questions as to whether Bieber would be forced to take a step back in Vegas.

With a 47-0 record on the line, Mayweather knows this fight is without doubt the biggest of his career - and the most lucrative

However, Bieber confirmed in a video posted online that he will be part of Mayweather's entourage for the mega-fight, shouting 'hell yeah' when asked by reporters.
