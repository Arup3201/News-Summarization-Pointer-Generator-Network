This 14-year-old girl was fatally stabbed 15 times on her way home from school and left to die in a pool of her own blood next to a main road.

Now, almost 30 years after Tina Faelz was brutally killed in Pleasanton, California, police have arrested a suspect thanks to a new DNA match.

Her Foothill High School classmate Steven John Carlson, 43, has reportedly been arrested over the death that ‘devastated’ a community.

Police would not name the suspect because he was a minor at the time of the incident - but the San Francisco Chronicle identified him as Carlson.

Carlson, who was 16 at the time, allegedly murdered Tina while she walked home from school in April 1984 and took a shortcut by a drainage ditch.

But less than an hour after she went through the dark culvert her bloody body was found and she had been stabbed more than 15 times.

She would usually take the bus home but did not want to be teased by other pupils anymore and chose to walk, her mother Shirley Orosco said.

The crime baffled police and they in fact interviewed Carlson shortly after Tina was found on a shortcut route that no longer exists.

It took until 2007 for a DNA 
breakthrough when police sent evidence to the FBI for re-examination, 
reported the San Francisco Chronicle.

The FBI’s lab matched the biological evidence to Carlson last year and it helped them rebuild the whole case, authorities said.

Carlson lived near the shortcut and became a registered sex offender after Tina’s death, but police don't believe he sexually assaulted her.

Pleasanton Police Chief David Spiller told the San Francisco Chronicle that the local area was ‘rocked’ with a reaction of ‘purely shock’.

‘The brutal murder of this 14-year-old freshman made the people of Pleasanton look at the world entirely different that day,’ he said.

Carlson is expected to be arraigned on Wednesday at the Alameda County Juvenile Justice Center before he is moved to an adult court.

He was released from Santa Cruz County Jail where he was being held on unrelated drug charges and a probation breach.

Carlson was convicted for sexual assault on a child in Yolo County in 1989 that made him a sex offender and landed him in jail for three years.

He was also convicted of assault with a deadly weapon three years ago and sent to prison for 120 days, reported the San Francisco Chronicle.

Ron Orosco, husband of Tina’s mother Mrs Orosco, 63, said she ‘lost a child’ and wants to know who was responsible before she dies.

Leslie Davisson, 43, told the San Francisco Chronicle she used to go through the same shortcut and the killing ‘rocked our teenage worlds’.
