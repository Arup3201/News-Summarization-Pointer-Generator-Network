As a proud hunter who enjoys the outdoor lifestyle, Paul Ryan's appeal to the base of the Republican Party is thought to have been one of the main reasons why Mitt Romney chose the self-styled action man for his presidential ticket.

So when the Wisconsin Congressman was photographed in Cincinnati yesterday buying his 10-year-old daughter camouflage gear for a hunting expedition this Fall to go along with the rifle he got her last Christmas, the outrage from liberal's condemning the father-daughter trip was all too predictable.

But the backlash against father-of-three Ryan has been met with a remarkable counter-backlash from gun enthusiasts across the country who have taken to Twitter to post pictures of their little girls posing with rifles, automatic weapons and hand guns supporting the GOP politicians right to introduce his daughter to firearms.

The small army of support began when Fox News contributor Michelle Malkin spoke up in favour of Ryan and tweeted that she had taken her 12-year daughter shooting for her birthday and that 'Self-defence is one of the best gifts you can give a girl.'

This invited hundreds of dads, mothers and supporters of the Second Amendment to come forward to share their memories and pictures of learning to shoot from their father or of teaching their girl to fire a gun.

One proud parent with the Twitter name @OffACough uploaded a picture of his 13-year-old daughter with her Remington 870 shotgun and the 20-pound turkey that she had just killed and that she was going to eat before heading off to the mall to buy some shoes.

Michelle Malkin's tweet that started the whole backlash against the backlash is replied to by Randy Janinda who also tweeted his daughter at the shooting range on her 16th birthday

Some of the tweets from individuals were in defence of their constitutional rights, with Rob O'Donnell putting pictures on the social networking site of his two girls with semi-automatic weapons stating, 'it's not only my right, but my duty to share and teach the love of shooting with my daughters.'

One father, Matt McCracken, decided to put a sweet picture of his little girl holding a rifle almost as tall as her onto Twitter, stating that 'this is my daughter age 10 learning gun safety.'

In addition to dads standing up for Paul Ryan, daughters got in on the act too.

Stephanie Janiczek tweeted, 'My Papa bought me my first shotgun, a Remington MDL 1100 with a full choke barrell when I was twelve. Got first buck with it.'

Rob O'Donnell claimed it was his duty to support his daughters learning how to shoot - just like like Paul Ryan

An avid hunter and outdoorsman, Paul Ryan somewhat expectedly found himself under attack when he took a break from a bus tour through Ohio to shop at Outdoor World for 15 minutes to buy his 10-year-old ddaughter Liza camouflage gear.

He told the reporters who followed him that he is going to take her deer hunting this fall in Wisconsin and Oklahoma, which is where his wife's family lives.

'She's going to get to go hunting this year for the first time,' said Ryan, who has previously told the press that he bought his daughter a Remington 700. 243 junior model rifle last Christmas.

'She's 10-years-old, so she can hunt starting at 10.

'She's been getting ready, she's been practicing.

'I just need to get her some clothes.'

The controversy started after Paul Ryan was seen to buy his ten-year-old daughter hunting gear while he took a break from campaigning in Ohio

Buying his girl gloves and a jacket for $101.14, Ryan has spoken at length in the past about his love of American outdoor pursuits.

He has pointedly said 'Hey, I'm a Catholic deer hunter. I am happy to be clinging to my guns and my religion', which is a dig at President Obama who made a campaign speech in San Francisco in 2008 in which he said some voters, 'cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them.'

But in comparison to his boss, Paul Ryan is a big-game hunter comparable to Theodore Roosevelt.

'I'm not a big-game hunter. I've made that very clear. I've always been a rodent and rabbit hunter. Small varmints, if you will,' said Mitt Romney in 2008, during his first unsuccessful tilt at the U.S. presidency.

The support for Ryan, 42, followed the initial backlash his shopping trip for his daughter first provoked.

One Twitter user, Troy Martez took to the site to post the message that 'Aww! There's nothing sweeter than a Dad and a daughter bonding over the body of a dead animal they probably won't eat.'

Another user called @nschim posted: 'Ryan gets daughter a rifle??? Maybe its for her shotgun wedding if she is not allowed to use birth control.'

According to an interview with Deer & Hunting magazine, Ryan 'shoots a Mathews Z7Xtreme compound and loves the thrill of bow-hunting, but also enjoys firearms.'

'My daughter she's been hunting with me for years, watching me, but she's old enough this year to hunt on her own.

'She's really looking forward to it.'

An earlier version of this article carried a caption that suggested the girl in the first image was holding a military grade assault rifle.Â  We are happy to clarify that this is not the case.
