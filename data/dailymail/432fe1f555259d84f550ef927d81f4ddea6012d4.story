Need some inspiration deciding who to back at Cheltenham? Sportsmail's Marcus Townend and Peter Scudamore reveal their favourites...

Peter Scudamore - Eight-time champion jockey and rider of 13 Festival winners

HARGAM (Triumph Hurdle, 1.30)

No secret that this is regarded as one of AP McCoy’s best chances of the week. He was recruited from France, where he showed decent form on the Flat, and although he was beaten by a good rival on his hurdling debut, has won his two races since. Last time out he slammed Starchitect, who ran a commendable fourth in the Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle here on Tuesday.

BEST ODDS: 6-1

AP McCoy and Hargam won the JCB Triumph Hurdle Trial at Cheltenham in December

HOLYWELL (Gold Cup, 3.20)

Rain would admittedly diminish confidence in Jonjo O’Neill’s runner but he has all the credentials to run really well. He has won at the past two Festivals, peaks at this time of year and has been re-fitted with the blinkers which seem to bring out the best in him. His last time out victory at Kelso indicated the spark had been rekindled in this gelding by his shrewd trainer after a couple of moderate efforts.

BEST ODDS: 9-1

CURRENT EVENT (Foxhunters’ Chase, 4.0)

Owned, but not trained, by Paul Nicholls and prepared for this race by one of his long-time staff, Rose Loxton. Had won his previous seven point-to-points before being taken up to Musselburgh where he sauntered home in a Hunter Chase.

BEST ODDS: 9-1

NEXT SENSATION (Grand Annual Chase, 5.15)

Fourth in this race last year after trying to make all the running and only being overhauled after the last fence. He races off a similar handicap mark and, while his form this season has been a touch below par, he has had a breathing operation since his last run.

BEST ODDS: 10-1

CAPTAIN HEATH - Marcus Townend on the best each-way bets 

KAREZAK (Triumph Hurdle, 1.30)

Alan King’s entry has been locking horns with the best juvenile hurdlers all season and, while a sequence of four second places might seem off-putting, he does not lack heart. Fast pace should play to his strengths and could hit the frame.

BEST ODDS: 20-1

Karezak (pictured right) is a decent each way bet in the opener on the Festival's final day

TEA FOR TWO (Albert Bartlett Novices’ Hurdle, 2.40)

Romped home in January’s Lanzarote Hurdle at Kempton and subsequently beaten at Ascot. But those races were at a shorter distance and the mount of Lizzie Kelly shapes as if he will improve for the greater stamina test.

BEST ODDS: 33-1

THE GIANT BOLSTER (Gold Cup, 3.20)

Has become a regular in this race having finished second, fourth and third in the last three runnings. Form this season has been unspectacular but this has been the day local trainer David Bridgwater has trained him for all season. Hard to see him winning but easier to see him in the places under regular jockey Tom Scudamore.

BEST ODDS: 33-1

HOTSPOTS

Work Whisper: One Last Dream (Wolverhampton, 5.45)

Weighting Game: That’s The Deal (Fakenham, 2.55). Down 22lb from last winning mark.

Burnt Fingers: Revolutionist (Lingfield, 4.25)
