In the speech, Mr Cameron said 'there is further to go' in filtering out extremist propaganda online

Majot internet firms must act faster to delete terrorist propaganda including beheading videos, David Cameron warned yesterday.

Movies showing extremist violence should be treated like those showing child abuse, the Prime Minister said.

Firms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter have a ‘social responsibility’ to strengthen filters, improve reporting and be more proactive in taking down the material.

In a speech to the Australian parliament, in Canberra, Mr Cameron said the West faced a ‘new and pressing challenge’ in filtering out extremist propaganda designed to radicalise impressionable youngsters.

The warning came as Mr Cameron revealed that the security services have foiled multiple ‘major plots’ to attack the UK in recent months – and stepped up pressure on Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg to allow the reintroduction of control orders on terror suspects. 

British police and intelligence experts are already removing 1,000 extremist images and videos a week from the internet – equal to one every ten minutes.

Of these, some 80 per cent relate to jihadist activities in Iraq and Syria. But Mr Cameron said leading internet firms also had a ‘role’ to play. He added: ‘We are making progress but there is further to go.

‘This is their social responsibility. And we expect them to live up to it.’

His comments came as Downing Street announced that several major internet companies have now signed a deal to make it easier to taken extremist propaganda offline.

Mr Cameron announced the crackdown as a British jihadi in Syria sought revenge on the Government’s decision to strip him of his citizenship by posting bomb-making instructions on the internet.

The Islamic State fighter, who calls himself ‘Muslim-Al-Britani’, said he had recently arrived in the war zone from the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

In a badly-spelled message on his Twitter account – now suspended – he said: ‘I just wana thank the Home Secretary Theresa May 4 taking my British Citizenship away. I thought I should reward her.’

He then posted details of how other jihadis could construct home-made bombs and assemble weapons. The man, who is based in the IS stronghold of Raqqa in northern Syria, is thought to come from Manchester.
