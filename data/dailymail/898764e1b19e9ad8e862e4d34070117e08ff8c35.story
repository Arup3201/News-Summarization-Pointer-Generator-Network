The University of New Mexico's women's football team are at the centre of a 'hazing' controversy following team initiations on Sunday evening.

Allegations that new players were forced to strip naked, had urine thrown over them and were made to drink an excessive volume of alcohol have led to an investigation by the university. 

Two students left the University of New Mexico (UNM) as a result of the initiations, which reportedly left two players hospitalised.

Controversy: University of New Mexico's women's soccer team are being investigated by their college for allegedly forcing players to strip naked and have urine sprayed on them during a hazing incident

UNM women's training was cancelled earlier this week as the university continues to investigate. 

Hazing is a form of aggressive initiation to a team, which usually involves humiliation and abuse.

Only six of the 50 US states do not have anti-hazing laws - including New Mexico - but, although the police are currently not investigating the incident, if it is decided a crime has been committed then they may still intervene.

Despite no criminal investigation taking place, the police were called to the incident on Sunday night and rushed two players to hospital.
