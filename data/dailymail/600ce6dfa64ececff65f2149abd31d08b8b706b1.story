Newcastle United scouts will check on FC Sion striker Moussa Konate this weekend.

The 21-year-old Senegal international first attracted English clubs' interest while playing for his country's Olympic side in 2012 where he scored five goals in four games and finished as the tournament's second top scorer.

West Ham, Fulham and Aston Villa have all tracked his career at various stages and Newcastle will watch him on Sunday when Sion visit Young Boys of Berne.

Newcastle have checked on Aleksandar Mitrovic at Anderlecht, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of Borussia Dortmund and Burnley's Danny Ings but fear they could miss out on all in the summer and are weighing up alternatives.

Konate is quick and 6ft tall. He can play on either wing and as a central striker and replaced West Ham's Diafra Sakho in Senegal's Africa Cup of Nations squad.

He has scored five goals in 13 games so far this season.
