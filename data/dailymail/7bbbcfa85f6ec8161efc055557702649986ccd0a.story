Real Madrid midfielder James Rodriguez returned to training this week as he stepped up his recovery from a fractured metatarsal that has kept him sidelined since the start of February.

The Colombia ace, signed from Monaco for £63million last summer, sustained the foot injury during Real Madrid's 2-1 La Liga win against Sevilla one month ago and has now started work on the training pitch.

The 23-year-old trained alone on Wednesday and he went through some light exercises with the ball as he closes in on a return to full fitness.

Meanwhile, Gareth Bale and Co prepared for Saturday's league match against Athletic Bilbao at San Mames as Real look to ramp up the pressure on Barcelona.

Luis Enrique's side don't play in La Liga until Sunday and, should Carlo Ancleotti's side return to winning ways against Athletic, could find themselves five points behind the league leaders doing into the clash with Rayo Vallecano.

Real Madrid were held to a 1-1 draw with Villarreal at the Bernabeu on Saturday after being pegged back Gerard Moreno after Cristiano Ronaldo had given the hosts the lead in the first half.

Ancelotti is unlikely to be have lost too much sleep as Real are still well placed to win their first La Liga title since 2011-12 under Jose Mourinho.

'The team is improving,' Ancelotti told a news conference after the Villarreal game.

'We've dropped two points but La Liga will be decided in the final match,' the Italian added.

'We have to focus on the two-point lead we've got, which isn't much, but is a lead we must make the most of. Now we have to carry on and in the next game, which will be difficult, try to produce a good reaction.'
