Obama's approval rating has dropped a staggering eight points over the past month to 45 percent, his lowest approval rating since November 2011, according to a new national poll.

The drop comes in the wake of controversies over government surveillance of call and Internet data, IRS targeting of conservative groups and the Justice Department's collection of reporters' phone records.

The CNN survey reveals that for the first
time in Obama's presidency, half of voters believe he is not honest or 
trustworthy. When he was elected, more then seven in 10 respondents thought he fit those characteristics.

A PRESIDENT IN TURMOIL

Obama's disapproval rating, at 54 percent, is at its highest 
point in a year and a half - and up nine points since last month.

A decline in supportÂ  among young people has fueled the downward spiral in Obama's ratings.

'The
drop in Obama's support is fueled by a dramatic 17-point decline over 
the past month among people under 30, who, along with black Americans, 
had been the most loyal part of the Obama coalition,' said CNN Polling 
Director Keating Holland.

Obama took the biggest hits to his approval ratings on foreign affairs (down 
10 points to 44 percent since January) and counterterrorism (down 13 points to 52 
percent since January).

His ratings on domestic issues, such as the economy and 
immigration, only dropped two to four points.

PUBLIC VIEWS ON GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE

A majority (61 percent) of voters said 
they disapprove of the government's surveillance of U.S. citizens, 
according to the CNN poll, which was conducted by phone last week.

More than half of Americans oppose the leaks by former security contractor Edward Snowden, who brought the government surveillance programs to light

However, only 43 percent said the administration has gone 'too far' in restricting civil liberties in order to fight terrorism. Thirty-eight percent said the administration has been 'about right' on striking that balance and 17 percent said it has not gone far enough.

Specifically, the public is split on the NSA's collection of Verizon customers' phone data, but a majority (66 percent) support the analysis of Internet data belonging to foreign nationals outside the U.S.

Overall, six in 10 voters believe the 
government has collected their phone or Internet data, but only 8 percent think the administration is using that data to investigate them 
personally. Just over half believe the government
has stored their data without analyzing it and one third doubt the 
government accessed their data at all.

Additionally, more than half of Americans oppose the leaks by former security contractor Edward Snowden, who brought the government surveillance programs to light, and 54 percent say he should be brought back the U.S. and prosecuted for his actions.

Snowden fled to Hong Kong around the time that he leaked classified information on the programs to the media.
