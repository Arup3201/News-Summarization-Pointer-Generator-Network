TV presenter Noel Edmonds is preparing to buy the BBC with the backing of a group of wealthy investors to save it from ‘inevitable disaster’, he claimed yesterday.

The former BBC star – who now hosts Deal or No Deal on Channel 4 – said renewing the corporation’s current licence fee agreement would be ‘as futile as giving medicine to a corpse.’

Instead, he wants to turn it into a not-for-profit broadcaster run along commercial lines and slim down its ‘bloated’ bureaucracy.

Noel Edmonds rose to fame when he started out as a DJ on BBC Radio 1 - but now he has his sights set on a promotion after he has said that he would now like to part-own the corporation

The 65-year-old said he has assembled a group of rich backers under the name Project Reith, after the corporation’s first director general Lord Reith.

He insisted they ‘could and would pay’ the market price of the BBC, as calculated by a team of advisers and former BBC executives.

He said that finding the money to buy the corporation would not be a problem.’

Writing in The Sunday Times, Mr Edmonds said that he had meetings with business people across the globe and they all believed that a business model could be found to save the BBC.

He said: ‘Believe me, these people can make it happen. If ailing British companies such as Rolls-Royce, Land Rover, British Airways and Cadbury can be turned around, there is still hope for the BBC.’

Mr Edmonds first found fame on BBC Radio 1 before hosting TV shows including Top Of The Pops and Noel's Hose Party.

But he quit in 1999, publicly criticising the corporation’s management culture. In the past, he has refused to pay the licence fee in protest at the ‘threatening’ way in which it is collected.

Yesterday, the star claimed the BBC could face a mass ‘licence fee revolt’ and could collapse if just five per cent of households refused to pay the £145.50 annual charge.

Noel Edmonds blasted the 'bloated bureaucracy' at the BBC but said that there is still hope for the organisation

He said that he believes people 'deserve better' than the current organisation.

'BBC management has pursued an expansionist strategy that defies logic and the founding laws of commerce,' he said.

He blasted the organisation for purchasing new buildings rather than focusing on quality television.

My Edmonds declined to say how much it would cost to buy out the BBC, although experts have said its commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, is worth about £2billion alone.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Long-term polling shows that the licence fee is the funding method with single most backing and it’s been rising.

‘Support for the licence fee is at 53% - way ahead of subscription and advertising. It’s the top choice for funding the BBC across all ages, classes and whether you are in a Freeview, Virgin or Sky household.’
