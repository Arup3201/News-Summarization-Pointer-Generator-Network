The son of Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs has revealed plans to scatter the late criminal's ashes at the scene of the crime.

Michael Biggs, 39, has said it was his father's wish that a third of his remains would be spread at Bridego Bridge in Ledburn, Buckinghamshire on the 50th anniversary of the Great Train Robbery.

Brazilian-born Biggs-the-younger will also keep 'a few grains' which he will tattoo into his skin underneath an inking of his father on his arm.

One third of Ronnie Biggs' ashes will be sent to his ex-wife Charmian in Australia and the final third will be flown to Brazil, Michael Biggs told the Sun On Sunday.

Charmian,
 with whom Biggs was on good terms despite running off to Brazil and 
marrying Michael's mother, will scatter his ashes on the grave of their 
son who died in a car crash in 1971, aged ten.

Father-of-two
 Michael said that he will ensure that the final part 
of his father's remains is left under the Christ the Redeemer statue in 
Rio de Janeiro.

When announcing his 84-year-old 
father's death last month, he said: 'He was always present, very present
 in my life. He was always there for me and when my mother left, he was 
my mum and my dad all my life.

'I always knew about everything growing up but it was just part of my life.'

'I'm sad for all the family. Hopefully he will be remembered as a good father, and a gentle, generous and fine man,' he added.

Biggs became a household name as a 
result of his part in the gang which stole Â£2.6million (the equivalent 
of Â£40million today) from a train that they forced to stop at a bridge 
in Cheddington, Buckinghamshire.

Biggs's
 involvement in the Great Train Robbery has long been debated with some 
suggesting he was only involved because he could recruit a train driver 
to move the train once it had been stopped at a false set of signals.

Others
 suggest that he was the one who hit train driver Jack Mills around the 
head causing injuries that he never fully recovered from.

He
 shot to legendary status a couple of years later, however, when he 
escaped from prison and went on the run.

Within
 two years of being jailed, two of the robbers, Charlie Wilson and 
Biggs, escaped from Wandsworth Prison - Biggs scaled a wall with a rope 
ladder.

Three years before the robbery, Biggs had married his wife Charmian, with whom he had three sons.

They joined him in Australia after his escape from prison, and began a new life together using fake new identities.

When
 police discovered who he really was, they raided the family home - but 
Biggs had fled a day earlier, leaving his wife and children behind.

The
 fugitive ended up in Brazil while Charmian and the boys continued 
living in Australia, where in 1971 son Nicholas died in a car accident 
at the age of 10.

While
 living in Rio, Biggs began an affair with Raimunda de Castro, a 
nightclub dancer 18 years his junior, and the couple had a son, Michael,
 in 1974.

The birth of 
the boy meant that Biggs could no longer be extradited, as the parents 
of Brazilian citizens cannot be deported from the country.

Michael
 - who later became a well-known musician in his homeland - tried to 
dissuade his father from returning to Britain, and been one of his most 
outspoken supporters.

He
 returned to the UK from exile in Rio de Janeiro in 2001 against 
Michael's wishes, saying he wanted to go to a pub in Margate 'as an 
Englishman and buy a pint of bitter'.

He was eventually freed from jail in 2009 on 'compassionate grounds' by then Justice Secretary Jack Straw.

In his final years, he was cared for at Carlton Court
 Care Home in East Barnet, north London, after suffering several strokes
 in recent years, and Michael moved to Britain to be close to his father.
