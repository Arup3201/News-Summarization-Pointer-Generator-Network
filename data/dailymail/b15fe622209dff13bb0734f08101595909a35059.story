Stand-up comedian and actor Omid Djalili – long-time Chelsea supporter – was shocked by the video footage of fans racially abusing a passenger on the Paris Metro.

Djalili, born in London to Iranian parents, witnessed violence and racism on the Stamford Bridge terraces in the 1970s and 1980s and sees the widespread condemnation of the fans’ actions as a good thing for society.

To say I was shocked and dismayed when I saw the video is an understatement. At first I thought it was a random thing posted on twitter so I've been pleasantly surprised that people are making a fuss about it.

I’m glad it's being taken seriously because when you break it down the behaviour is appalling. World-wide condemnation of this sort of thing, however small in the grand scheme of things, is a good thing for society.

Everyone has a video camera on their phone these days, linked in to social media, so more cases are exposed and more people are standing up and saying enough is enough. It's good to remind ourselves that it wasn't always the case.

Back in the 1970s and 1980s the violence was far worse. I remember as a teenager seeing people being abused or beaten up every two or three games. So-called ‘football fans’ did this regularly and no one would do a thing – everyone would keep their heads down and stay quiet.

What was amazing was that man in Paris, after being pushed off once tried to get on the train again because he couldn't accept what was happening - I know I would have recognised these were nutters and would have just moved along to the next entrance. But that's a Pavlovian reaction I'd have because I'm used to avoiding drunken behaviour. This man just didn't compute.

You hear the blokes chanting football songs so you'd assume they're football fans but I'd call them fans of alcohol and thuggery, fans of a group mentality where it's supposedly ok to push a black man off a train and then chant about racism and say ‘that’s the way we like it’.

It's alcohol-fuelled behaviour – and that is the problem. We tend to forgive people and excuse their behaviour by saying ‘he’s had a drink’, but in my mind that's just not acceptable any more.

This is not just a football problem. These people may identify themselves as football fans - and Chelsea should do everything to keep them away from the club and ban them (not for life I would add, there's always room for improvement in all our lives) – but it's a wider societal problem. Chelsea are owned by a Russian and half the players are black or multi national, and as a club have already done so much to curb this behaviour. I certainly have not seen this at Stamford Bridge for years.

We need fans to stand up and show that we will not tolerate behaviour like this.

I sit near the away fans at Chelsea and we’ve had issues with people goading the opposition and passing it off as ‘banter’. Kids talk about this is schools about the line between "banter" and offensive and hurtful behaviour. But deep down everyone knows when a line is crossed.

What's needed is people with a voice to stand up and say that they are crossing the line and should stop. It makes me genuinely happy and very hopeful when I see that this is happening. We are evolving. Finally.

Kick It Out chairman Lord Ouseley (far left) has condemned the incident and called for action by Chelsea

The Professional Footballers' Association condemned the 'group of so-called Chelsea fans' and PFA deputy chief executive, Bobby Barnes, said: 'I am extremely saddened that such a great football club has had its name dragged into the gutter by a very ignorant minority who seemingly equate supporting Chelsea and cheering for the likes of Didier Drogba, Ramires and John Obi Mikel, with abusing a fellow passenger on a train who was going about his own business.

'I am sure that Chelsea will seek to take strong action against the supporters shown in the video as the club works very hard through their community and education programmes.' 

Kick It Out chairman Lord Ouseley echoed their stance, and said: 'I was shocked that Chelsea fans were still behaving like this. 

'I thought the club had made it quite clear and taken action about stopping any repetition, knowing Chelsea, how hard they've worked on these matters, with fans as well as players, that it was unlikely to occur.

'The fact it involved an assault as well, of the individual that they pushed off the train, was even more shocking. Clearly it sends out a strong signal to, not only Chelsea, but the whole of football, that you cannot be complacent and think the actions you're taking are sufficient to deal with the scourge of racism, sexism, homophobia and anti-Semitism. We've got to do a lot more and not be complacent.'
