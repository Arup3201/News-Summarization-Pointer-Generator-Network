The State of the Union address got a bit of Hollywood glamour on Tuesday night when the famed Twitter Mirror, a regular at awards show red carpets, made an unexpected appearance at the White House.

First Lady Michelle Obama and some of her guests posed for selfies taken by the mirror which included the hashtag #SOTU.

The first selfie tweeted out by Michelle Obama's @FLOTUS account featured Anthony Mendez, who overcame homelessness to go to college, and Malik Bryant, a 13 year-old from Chicago. Both were White House guests to the State of the Union address.

Another pictured featured the First Lady posing with Dr. Jill Biden, the wife of the Vice President.

More commonly used at award shows like The Oscars and The Grammys, the mirror was making its first ever appearance at The White House. It is believed to be part of efforts by the White House to appeal to a younger demographic.

Michael Kors Suit

From the Fall 2013 collection

Michelle Obama wore Michael Kors to the President's State of the Union address and the Internet went crazy.  Almost immediately after the speech, Twitter and the blogoshere were buzzing about the First Lady's choice to sport the grey zip-front jacket and matching skirt.

Wearing a modified version of the catwalk two-piece, which featured a belt around the waist and a front slit, the mother of two kept it modest and business appropriate.

This isn't the first time we've seen Michelle in pieces from the popular designer and we're sure it won't be her last. The political powerhouse has attended several events clothed in the New York-based brand's luxury items.

This look is from a few seasons back, so it isn't available to purchase. However, we've rounded up some skirt suits worth taking a look at. The Albert Nipon selection at Neiman Marcus has got our vote.
