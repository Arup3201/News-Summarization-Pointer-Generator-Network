He is a 255 lb. tight end who broke many a tackle en route to scoring seven touchdowns for the Detroit Lions in his first NFL season, but it seems there is one thing guaranteed to take down Joseph Fauria - his adorable puppy, Lil Rufio.

Fauria, 24, was chasing his teeny tiny three-month-old Pomeranian/Husky mix around the house Wednesday night after the pup 'kind of did something bad,' and ended up spraining his left ankle in the process.  

'It was kind of an agonizing pain,' is how he described the feeling that went through his body when he missed the last two steps on his staircase and slid on his hardwood floor.

Adorable: Fauria told reporters Lil Rufio (above) did something bad so he was chasing him, then felt an agonizing pain when he missed two steps on the stairs and slide across his wood floor

'He was about to pee and I was like, 'Come here you little ... nugget,' Fauria revealed to reporters on Monday. 

'And I was chasing him downstairs. I wasn't running but I was chasing him downstairs and I just misstepped and I reached with my left foot and I just didn't end up well.'

He also said that some neighbors drove him to have his ankle checked and, despite what earlier reports have stated, he did not hurt himself playing volleyball or at a bar. 

He has not revealed when he will be able to play again.

Sidelined: Fauria (above) is now on the injury list for an undisclosed amount of time

Still best buds: Both Fauria and Lil Rufio have expressed over social media that they are still the best off friends

Since the incident, both Fauria and Lil Rufio have been talking about what happened on their Instagram accounts.

That's right, Lil Rufio has an Instagram account.

'Now I'm only concentrating on getting back on the field ASAP! Please no death threats to Lil' Rufio, he's just a pup!' wrote Fauria on Monday.

As for Lil Rufio, he wrote yesterday, 'Check your facts, I'm not an assailant, I'm a pomsky, Duh.'

It's great to see there are no hard feelings between the two.
