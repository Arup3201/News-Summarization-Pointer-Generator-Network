Leading radiographer Paul Welch, 59, who has been accused of using a hospital computer to search the web for 'upskirt' images

A man in charge of hospital x-rays used his NHS computer to look for 'upskirt' photos of X-factor judge Nicole Scherzinger, Jennifer Aniston and Britney Spears, a disciplinary panel was told today.

Leading radiographer Paul Welch was caught using the hospital computer to search for indecent images of celebrities and erotic fiction about incest, it was claimed.

The 59-year-old left his job after he was faced with allegations that he had used a NHS reception computer to search for naked and upskirt pictures  of the stars who also included Beyonce and Miley Cyrus.

The married father-of-two also allegedly used the hospital PC to search for father-daughter sex tales during internet sessions.

The NHS radiographer denied the claims but retired after 38 years of work following an internal investigation by hospital chiefs, who held him responsible for the searches.

Welch was in charge of the radiography department at the West Berkshire Community Hospital in Thatcham, Berkshire, when a colleague 'stumbled upon' the search terms in the browser history on the PC.

He was identified as the prime suspect after it emerged he was the only person working in the radiography department at the time when computer records showed the searches were made between May 10 and May 18 last year.

When he was quizzed in an internal NHS probe, Welch admitted searching for one unnamed American actress who runs her own lingerie line because he said he knew her personally.

However, he denied he had searched for other inappropriate material on the PC just minutes later and described it as a 'coincidence', a disciplinary panel from the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) heard today, which went ahead in his absence.

Mary Page, counsel for the HCPC, said the searches took place on May 10, 11 and 18 last year at the reception desk computer in the hospital’s radiography department.

The radiographer denied the claims and retired after 38 years of work following an internal investigation by hospital chiefs, who held him responsible for the searches, a disciplinary hearing was told today

'The inappropriate searches were stumbled upon by a colleague of the registrant (Welch) as they were searching on the computer in the reception area in the hospital,' she said.

'When searching in the search engine box, you put in a number of letters and an auto-fill function shows you previous searches.

'When the colleague saw the list of previous searches, she was immediately concerned as to their content.

'One that particularly concerned her was a search of a female that was known as an acquaintance of the registrant.'

The panel was told that woman was an American actress who has her own underwear line.

The married father-of-two also allegedly used the hospital PC at West Berkshire Community Hospital to search for taboo father-daughter sex tales

Miss Page said naked pictures of the actress were searched for by Welch on May 10 last year.

Twenty seconds later, this was followed by searches for 'Naked celebrities', and 'Nicole Scherzinger panties'.

The following day, there was a search for 'Christine Bleakley Simon Cowell 50th birthday party upskirt'.

There were also searches for 'Naked celebrities', 'Beyonce Upskirt', 'Britney Spears birthday no panties', and 'Miley Cyrus upskirt'.

Miss Page continued that Mr Welch made a number of searches for incest terms.

Searches were made for explicit shots of celebrities, including Miley Cyrus

She added: 'Rota documents were compared to the searches and the registrant was identified as the most likely staff member to be responsible.

'Those searches took place between 5pm and 5.30pm approaching the end of the day and towards after-hours.'

Miss Page said Welch was interviewed about the searches by Geoff Pinney, a senior pathologist at the Royal Berkshire Hospital Trust, during an internal inquiry in July last year.

She said: 'He admitted he may have used the computer and he confirmed searching for female AB.

'He denied searching for any of the other terms found on the search history - even though they were just minutes later - and said it was a coincidence only.'

Welch claimed he had been 'set up' by disgruntled staff' and that everyone knew the generic log-in details for the computer and that the PC may even have been accessed remotely.

He told Mr Pinney: 'Yes, I’ve heard of Britney Spears but I’m not into celebrities or anything to do with them.'

Giving evidence, Mr Pinney told the panel in London that he did not believe the experienced radiologist’s side of the story.

'The opinion I formed during the interview was that the registrant was lying to me,' he said.

Welch, ofTilehurst, Reading, Berkshire, retired after the NHS trust inquiry concluded that he had breached its computer use policies.

He wrote a letter to the HCPC panel today saying he had 'no intention of returning to work as a radiographer' and therefore would not be attending to hear if was to be struck off.

In her closing statement to the panel, Miss Page said: 'The circumstantial evidence, taken altogether, is persuasive.

'You can see the pattern of searches and the timing of the searches with just seconds or minutes between them.

'The registrant was the only man in the department accessing this computer.

'It’s a generalisation but it is more likely that a man would be searching and looking for these search terms than a woman.

'In this scenario, I would suggest the search terms are inappropriate. They are not medically justified.

'The only reason for these search terms is for personal pleasure or personal gratification. They are sexual in nature and not appropriate.'

Miss Page said Welch’s behaviour undermined public confidence in his profession.

She added: 'Whilst it may not trouble an ordinary member of the public to find out the registrant was doing this in his own time at home, it clearly damages the reputation of this individual as it was being done on work equipment.

'It clearly raises questions about the registant’s judgement, if nothing else.'

The panel retired to consider its judgment this afternoon.

It must decide if Welch is guilty of misconduct, and if so whether that impairs him to practice as a radiographer.
