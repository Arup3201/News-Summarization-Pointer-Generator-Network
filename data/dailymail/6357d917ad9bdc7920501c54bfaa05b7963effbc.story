Tragedy: Dana Ferrari, 28, was struck by a train on the no.2 train track at 34th street on New Year's day in the early hours of the morning

The family and boyfriend of a young New Jersey women who was killed by a subway train after stumbling onto the tracks on New Year's day are reeling in shock with unanswered questions as to how she ended up there.

Dana Ferrari, 28, a pediatrician's office employee, had travelled to Madison Square Garden with fiancé Blake Pupo and his brother to see a Phish concert on New Year's Eve but disappeared in the middle of the night's festivities.

Witnesses at the 34th street subway station say they saw Miss Ferrari in the early hours of the morning staggering around the no.2 line platform before stepping onto the track and lying down.

The New York Post reports that 
according to law enforcement officials, it was too late by the time the 
driver saw her and she was struck by the train just after 5 a.m.

The
horrific news comes just days after an unsuspecting man was shoved 
under a Manhattan subway train by a mumbling woman in a horrific hate 
crime, and just weeks after a homeless man pushed a Queens father-of-one
onto the tracks after an altercation on the platform.

According to the victim's sister, Leslie
Ferrari, 22, of Andover, Mr Pupo went to the bathroom during the 
concert and when he returned his fiancée had gone.

'He’s a mess,' she told the Post. 'We’d like to have more answers. How did she get into the train station?'

Family members cannot make sense of 
the unspeakable tragedy, seeing no reason that Miss Ferrari would take 
her own life. Her sister recalls a text message she sent to her at 
midnight that read: 'happy new year! i love you'.

But a police source told the New York
Daily News that Miss Ferrari had been spotted walking down a flight of 
service stairs to the track bed about 5:20 a.m.

Furthermore, contrary to witnesses 
claims that the victim appeared intoxicated, Miss Ferrari insisted that 
her sister 'definitely wasn't a drinker.'

Dana Ferrari was identified by the CVS loyalty card attached to her keys that belonged to Mr Pupo.

Stumbling: Despite reports that the victim appeared intoxicated, the city Medical Examiner's Office is still investigating the bizarre tragedy

Raised in Newton, New Jersey, she had been engaged to Mr Pupo since 2009 and had lived in Dingman's Ferry, Pennsylvania with him and their dog.

While her sister said that the medical examiner informed the family that the death was being treated as an accident, Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city Medical Examiner’s Office, said the cause of death was still listed as 'pending further study.'

'We are doing testing and further investigation,' including toxicology tests, she told the New York Post.

New Year's Eve: The shocking incident occurred just blocks from Times Square, where millions of revelers watched the ball drop hours earlier

Subway deaths are common in New York City.

Last year, according a report in the Daily News, there was about a fatality a week.

But they have been getting extra scrutiny in recent weeks after the two men were shoved to their deaths in December.

In the most recent case, which took place on Thursday in Queens, Erica Menendez, 31, has been charged with murder as a hate crime in connection with the incident, which resulted in the death of 46-year-old Sunando Sen.
