A Florida man has been sentenced to three and a half years in a Colorado prison for selling a dangerous synthetic weed that 'was not meant for human consumption' and had not been properly tested under racy names like 'Sexy Monkey'.

Daniel Bernier, 28, was one of nine people charged over manufacturing, marketing and distributing the drug that has come to be known as 'Spice'.

Prosecutors said Bernier imported chemicals from China and then sprayed them onto leaves.

He then packaged the product with a warning label saying it should not be consumed, but called the drug different provocative names, including Sexy Monkey, and targeted young people when selling, The Denver Post reported.

Busted: The synthetic weed, marketed with names such as 'Sexy Monkey' but better known as 'Spice', was made using imported chemicals from China that were sprayed on leaves 

'Nobody knew what the effect of these chemicals would be other than it would make people high,' Federal prosecutor Jaime Peña said.

At least 221 people were admitted to hospital in Denver and Colorado Springs - just in August and September of 2013 - after using Spice.

The drug became known to cause powerful hallucinations, with one man trying to decaptiate himself.

Another user tried to set themselves on fire.

One 15-year-old boy died.

U.S. District Judge Philip Brimmer denied a move by Bernier's lawyers to reduce his sentence.

Bernier provided details to police over how his syndicate worked and explained how much money he lost - over $1.8 million - when the operation went bust, The Denver Post reported.

He even apologized to the judge. 

'My actions were ignorant,' he said.

'They were reckless.'

However the judge did not budge.

He said the the 'big picture' was that Bernier knew his product was not ready for consumption but continued to sell it in the name of money.

'That was fire Mr. Bernier was willing to play with,' the judge said. 

Bernier received the three and a half year jail sentence, along with three years probation on top of it.

Four of the nine people allegedly involved in the syndicate have entered guilty pleas.
