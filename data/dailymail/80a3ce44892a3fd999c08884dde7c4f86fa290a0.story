It could be a grim Christmas for 3,600 shop workers as Blacks Leisure is on the brink of going into administration.

The struggling outdoor clothing store, which put itself up for sale after massive losses, admitted it had failed to attract interest in its shares.

Workers at the head office and distribution centre in Northamptonshire could begin the year without a job, with the outlook bleak across the entire British High Street.

Who will buy? Loss-making Blacks has failed to attract interest in its shares after putting itself up for sale

Miserable month: Carpetright had an £800,000 loss over six months, Thomas Cook is merging with Co-Op travel, La Senza is 'restructuring' and Cadbury is laying off 200 jobs

Blacks at least hopes to sell off its trade, assets and brands - which include Peter Storm and Eurohike

The loss-making group, which owns 98 
Blacks outlets and 208 Millets stores, is still in talks with potential 
buyers, who are said to include clothing companies Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Mountain Warehouse.

The unseasonably warm weather in 
October and November was a crippling blow for the outdoor clothing group
after a tough year.

Blacks is in £36million of debt and made a £16m loss in the 
first half of the year, reflecting the pain on much of the High Street.

Topshop owner 
Arcadia and department store John Lewis have both also cited the negative effects of autumn's 
record temperatures in the run-up to Christmas.

Dismal December: Millets, which is owned by Blacks Leisure, has been hit hard while retailers Barratts collapsed, Peacocks is closing 200 stores and Comet was sold for £2 after announcing losses of £22m

Even Tesco's sales were down almost one per cent on a year ago, despite its major price-cutting campaign.

Comet was sold for just £2 last month after losses of £22m in six months of trading. The electrical retailer has 245 stores, in which revenues slid by 18 per cent in the period to October 31.

There was more misery for workers last week when Thomas Cook, which posted losses of £400m for last year, said it was closing 200 stores last week.

The travel agency will cut around 1,000 jobs as it merges with Co-Op's high street travel agency business.

And in a depressing season, this month has seen La Senza begin a restructuring, putting 2,600 jobs and 158 stores at risk, and Kraft laying off up to 200 workers at Cadbury’s Bournville factory in Birmingham.

Shoe retailer Barratts collapsed earlier this month and Peacocks is also looking to close an estimated 200 stores.

Dark tidings: Blacks saw its shares plummet this year

Carpetright added to the gloom by 
posting the worst first-half performance in its history, making an 
£800,000 loss in the half-year which ended on October 29. In the 
previous six months they had made a £9.8million profit.

The news is a serious blow for the economy, with more than two million people currently unemployed.

Blacks now has a market value of less than £1million, and has indicated the likelihood of a pre-pack deal.

This is a speeded-up procedure in which a firm is sold immediately after entering administration.

Sports Direct, which is owned by Newcastle football club owner Mike Ashley, recently withdrew from talks over buying the company.

But they could still swoop for Blacks' assets if it goes into administration.
