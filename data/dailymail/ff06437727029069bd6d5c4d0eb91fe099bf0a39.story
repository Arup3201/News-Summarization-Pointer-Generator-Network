Steeped in tradition, the history of the Norland nanny has gone virtually unchanged since the company was founded in 1892. The gold standard of nannies, the Norland nanny is impeccably trained - and just as impeccably dressed.

Norland founder Emily Ward introduced a distinctive uniform so her highly trained nannies would not be mistaken for housemaids.

But now, for the first time in 70 years the uniform of these formidable figures, so beloved by royalty, celebrities and the wealthiest of families, has undergone an update.

No need for hysteria though. As befits one of the most highly esteemed Nanny schools in the world, the Norland uniform remains as proper as ever - and is certainly not a dramatic departure from the old.

Legacy:
 The first Norland Nurses in 1892 wore full-length dresses with aprons 
and leg o'mutton sleeves - a touch less practical than today's offering

The nannies' dresses maintain the 
beige, white and brown colouring that has long been associated with the brand. The practical styling and 
simple accessories - brown hat and brown gloves, or white in summer - remain 
unchanged.

But the new Norland nanny's outfit has a few modern flourishes that give the uniform a flavour of the modern day.

Turned-up cuffs, a more open neck (with no brown neck-tie) give a more 
contemporary look. Toned panelling at the waistline give the illusion of
 shape, making the dress a touch more flattering. The fabric is heavier, falls in a more appealing way and keeps its shape better.

The brown tights and sensible brown brogues remain. 

For
 winter, the coat has had a stylish update. The loose, fawn 
single-breasted overcoat has been replaced by a rather smart button-up 
coat in brown with a wraparound collar that has more than a hint of Mary
 Poppins about it. Velvet cuffs and an embroidered N on the tie complete
 the look.

The changes have been introduced in an attempt to make the dresses more flattering and practical.

As well as the formal uniform, the nannies have a ‘practical outfit’ for work placements, which features the vibrant blue used on the original Norland uniform.

The practical outfit consists of navy blue trousers and jumper and a speedwell blue polo shirt and a wax jacket.

Liz Hunt, Principal of Norland College, said: 'We felt it was important to modernise the uniform, just as we have made changes to the curriculum at the College [the college now includes self defence, skidpan driving and Taekwondo on the syllabus].

Modest: The 1950s style dress remains, but with a neater silhouette and heavier fabric - and retains its demure hemline

'Norland
 trains the childcare professionals and nannies of the future and we 
wanted a uniform which would appeal to modern-day students.

'Over the
 years, our uniform has gone from wools to silks and frills to stripes 
before settling on the brown and beige palette which is now recognised 
worldwide.

'The new style is more comfortable and practical for the 
students to wear, whilst also bringing the image of Norland up to date 
and in line with our new degree course.'

Norland College in Bath, Somerset, has been training professional nannies for the rich and famous since it inauguration - and has even placed its nannies in the Royal family: Prince Charles famously had a Norland nanny.

Graduates
 pay £36,000 for a four-year course.

The Norland uniform has been many colours over the 
years, starting as grey and pink, which quickly changed to blue to 
distinguish Norlanders from hospital ward maids.

It was in 1910 that the cloak became brown and then over the years hemlines rose from ankle to knee along with the fashions.

However, no major overhaul of the uniform has taken place since the 1930s.

The
 new uniform, for pupils studying for a BA (Hons) Early Years 
Development and Learning, was designed by Somerset-based, Lauren Cope 
and produced by UK suppliers.

Liz Hunt added: 'We have worked with 
our designer to ensure we keep the ‘essence’ of what makes a Norlander 
stand out, and that the standards expected from our students in terms of
 appearance and practice is not lost.

'Norland students are well 
known for their impeccable, smart appearance, whether they are 
travelling to college or on work placements with families or in a 
nursery or school.

'They are such recognisable figures on the streets
 of Bath and elsewhere, and we feel the new uniform has just the right 
mix of tradition and fashion.'

Trainee
 Charlotte Hannahford, 18, from Newton Abbott, Devon, added: 'I love the
 new uniform; it is much more flattering and feminine than the old one.'

Ellis
 Carveth, 19, from Newbury, Berks., added: 'The uniform was a really 
important factor when choosing to come to Norland College, the new 
uniform is much more flattering and contemporary, than the old uniform 
and I love it.

'It’s so much easier to move around with huge hidden pockets.

'There
 are really strict guidelines on our uniform when we are studying at the
 College and I think that’s really important as it means we always look 
smart and very professional.'

After
 unveiling the new uniforms, the pupils took part in a Mary 
Poppins-themed photoshoot around Bath, where the college has been based 
for the past ten years.

Seventies - and the uniform remains unchanged: Norland Nurses at Denford Park in the 1970s

Norland College, founded in 1892 by Emily Ward, is a leading provider of childcare training.Emily Ward introduced a uniform so Norland graduates needed to be recognised as professionals and not mistaken for housemaids and it is still a strong part of the college's tradition.The founder focused her training on the principles of Friedrich Froebel, the German educationalist who developed the 'kindergarten system'.Its Early Childhood Studies course concentrates on numerous aspects of childhood.Students study elements of social science, psychology, child health, history, literature and education.It also trains its students - known as 'Norlanders' when they graduate - how to work with families, develop a child's math skills and become a whizz in the kitchen and teach a child not only how to cook, but how to cook healthy meals.

Along with the traditional skills of cooking, sewing and first aid, new subjects on the curriculum include Taekwondo, self defence, skidpan driving - and escaping from paparazzi. In the second year of the course, students learn from a stunt driver on the Castle Combe Racing Circuit in Wiltshire who prepares them for all kinds of situations, from icy roads to potential kidnappers or paparazzi.
