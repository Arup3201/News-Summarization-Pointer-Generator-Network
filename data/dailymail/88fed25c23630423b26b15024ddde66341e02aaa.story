A man was charged by police after he was found drink driving a motorised Esky full of alcohol on a busy street in Hillarys, a suburb north of Perth.

The 22-year-old was caught riding down the middle of West Coast Drive by police who were patrolling the suburb on Friday night about 8pm.

A Western Australia Police media spokeswoman confirmed the Esky was full of beers, separate from the alcohol the man had already consumed, at the time he was stopped.

The spokeswoman confirmed the man was driving on the stretch of trafficable road, out the front of Sorrento Surf Club.

'He was actually driving on the road. It (the incident) had nothing to do with the club,' she told MailOnline.

'He was heading to the local petrol station, but I don't believe it was to get petrol.'

The Sorrento man was found to be over the 0.05 blood alcohol content limit and was charged with driving under the influence.

He is due to appear in court on a date yet to be set.

But it is not the first time a drunken reveller has been caught using an improvised Esky as a ride.

In March, a drunken 38-year-old man from Scarness, Queensland was charged with drink driving after he was caught riding a motorised Esky crammed with beer, cask wine and bourbon pre-mix drinks on a bike path.

In August 2011, a drunken 23-year-old man was fined $500 and was disqualified from driving for nine months for taking his four-strike 'extreme cooler' for a 'test drive' on a main road in Noosa Heads, Queensland 'for a bit of a giggle'.
