It is a fact that illustrates just how difficult the predicament is becoming for Roberto Martinez: in 2015, Bradford City have beaten more top flight teams than Everton.

Such a swaggering and creative force 12 months ago, this campaign has become one long episode of domestic disappointment and, on one of those unforgiving, slate-grey Merseyside afternoons, the woes failed to relent against Leicester City.

Everton somehow scrambled a 2-2 draw against the Barclays Premier League’s basement team but on a day when they handed out Blue Noses to fans to mark the 27th anniversary of Everton in the Community, the club charity, Martinez and Company might have been left with red faces.

How the Premier League table looks

Tim Howard, normally a figure of such composure and authority, made two uncharacteristic blunders that enabled David Nugent and Esteban Cambiasso to give Leicester a lead that they seemed certain to protect until, in the 88th minute, Matthew Upson put through his own goal.

Steven Naismith had opened the scoring for Everton in the 56th minute but not once did they threaten to go through gears, as they did so elegantly in Martinez’s debut campaign. This run – two wins in 14 Premier League matches since November 30 – is vexing their manager.

‘We need to find the enjoyment that we have in the Europa League,’ said Martinez, who refused to point the finger of blame at Howard. ‘We need to look forward to facing the opposition, as we do in Europe, and find enjoy the challenge of facing different teams.’

This Everton team is an enigma. Having looked so confident when they have ventured into Europe, having scored 14 goals in seven games to take them to the brink of the last 16, they have had no rhythm in the Premier League and will not be threatening the top six come May.

When Everton are on form, there is a pace and energy to how they go about their business but, from all on, you could see this was going to be one of those ponderous days to which they are prone, passing the ball from side to side without any conviction.

An obvious, if rudimentary, tactic to profit here would have been to keep playing balls out to the right flank for Aaron Lennon to scamper after, as neither Paul Konchesky nor Matthew Upson had the pace to get within five yards of the on-loan Tottenham man.

But, for some reason, they used it only sporadically and, as a result, Leicester were comfortable. Everton rarely had a sight of goal – Ross Barkley wasted their best chance when blazing over – while the visitors came closest to breaking the deadlock through a curling Andrej Kramaric effort.

Leciester started the second half confidently, too. They pinned Everton back and had Jeffrey Schlupp shown more composure, they would have taken the lead. Instead, however, Leciester fell behind in the 56th minute when Naismith squeezed a shot past Mark Schwarzer via deflection off Robert Huth.

Teams at the bottom can lose heart in such circumstances but Leicester’s character cannot be called into question and they roared back into the contest following Pearson’s decision to introduce Jamie Vardy and Nugent.

Vardy is a terrier and his scuttling run down the right in the 63rd minute, beyond Leighton Baines, caused panic but the danger should really have cleared his cross but, instead, Howard inexplicably turned the ball into Nugent’s path and the boyhood Evertonian swept in the loose ball.

That rattled Everton and a bigger calamity followed in the 70th minute when Howard completely misjudged Danny Simpson’s cross, allowed it to drift into the path of Vardy, who in turn gave Cambiasso a chance he could not miss.

‘We have three players around him and it ends up with him,’ said Martinez. ‘In football you are going to have errors but it is how you can help your team-mate when an action like that happens. 

'As a team we need to defend much better. I don’t see Tim as directly responsible of the draw.’

The mood darkened around Goodison, particularly when Romelu Lukaku fluffed two gilt-edged chances, but some form of redemption arrived in the 88th minute when Upson diverted into own net after Christian Atsu had crossed. It was harsh on Leicester but Pearson was phlegmatic.

The dressing room is very disappointed, as you can imagine. We have got to turn these performances into wins, it is that simple, because of the predicament we find ourselves in. But in terms of the performance, it was full of intent. But we didn’t do enough to win. That is the reality.’
