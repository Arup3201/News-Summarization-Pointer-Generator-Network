A toddler who captured the nation’s hearts when he drove down the aisle to deliver his parents' wedding rings in his favourite remote-controlled car has lost his battle with cancer.

Two-year-old Charlie Harris-Beard had been battling acute myeloid leukaemia since he was diagnosed in April 2011.

Today his parents said 'heaven had gained another angel' after he died this afternoon.

Charlie Harris-Beard was his father's best man when his parents Fiona and Joe hastily brought forward their wedding last November after learning he had just weeks to live

A message on the family Twitter page today said: 'Heaven gained another angel today as our little soldier Charles Joseph Harris-Beard peacefully passed away'

Charlie was his father's best man when his parents hastily brought forward their wedding when they learned he had just weeks to live last November.

Despite the odds, he defied doctors by living to see his last Christmas. But the experimental drug his family hoped would prolong his life later failed.

Courage: Charlie drove the rings down the ailse

Today, his older sister Ellie Louise, 12, told his 45,000 Facebook fans around the world he had finally lost his battle at 2.04pm, surrounded by family and friends.

In a heartbreaking Facebook tribute she said: 'Hello everyone, it's Charlie's big sister Ellie Louise.

'Minutes ago I had to sit with my mom, dad, family and Charlie, to say goodbye as the angels came down. Thank you everyone, (your) thoughts and prayers meant a lot.'

A message on the family Twitter page added: 'Heaven gained another angel today as our little soldier Charles Joseph Harris-Beard peacefully passed away.'

Today Charlie's mother Fiona said she was too devastated to talk about the passing. She said: 'Everything is just so raw at the moment.'

charlie returned home from hospital in 
January last year following a successful bone marrow transplant using 
stem cells from an American baby's umbilical cord.

But in November last year his parents Fiona, 31, Joe, 31, decided to 
bring their wedding forward so that their beloved Charlie could play a 
leading role as his dad's best man.

Charlie, wearing a smart black wedding suit, brought a tear to the eyes 
of the 300-strong congregation as he delivered the rings to his parents 
in his favourite remote-controlled car.

After the service at St Mary's Church in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, he smiled for pictures with his proud family.

His plight captured the hearts of the nation and his favourite football 
team Aston Villa even invited him and his family onto the pitch before a
match to meet his idols.

Pictures of the plucky youngster driving the wedding rings down the aisle in his favourite toy car made headlines around the world.

In a final attempt to save his life, Charlie had started a trial of the drug Aurora Kinase in December.

The revolutionary drug, which is 
administered over 72 hours every 21 days via intravenous infusion, is 
intended to inhibit cancer growth by blocking the enzymes which cause 
cancerous cells to grow.

But just weeks later, his parents announced the devastating news that the potentially lifesaving drug had failed to save him.

Today, followers took to his Facebook page to pay tribute to Charlie.

Paula Gouldstone wrote: 'Rest In Peace Charlie, such a brave little boy.
My heart bleeds for all his family and friends. Cant imagine how they 
are all coping right now, Such a shame. Sleep tight little angel xxxx'

Tanya Cunningham added: 'Night night Charlie Bear - you and your family 
have touched the hearts of so many and you'll never be forgotten - Rest 
In Peace little one xxxx'

Devastating: Charlie was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia on Easter Sunday 2011

Earlier today a picture had been posted showing a frail looking Charlie being cradled one last time by his big sister.

His heartbroken mother Fiona posted: 
'Ellie loved her picture with Charlie yesterday [Thursday], she wanted 
to show the whole world how much she loves him.

"However,
until Charlie is feeling stronger that will be his last picture, we 
know it can be upsetting seeing someone so poorly and don't want to 
offend anyone but it was important for Ellie to show you all how much 
she loves her brother.'
