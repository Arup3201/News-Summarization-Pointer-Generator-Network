She's the darling of the French film scene, a successful model and the brains behind her own philanthropic foundation.

Now Elisa Sednaoui has revealed that she's determined to ensure that poverty-stricken Egyptian girls get the education they deserve - and has teamed up with shoe supremo Christian Louboutin to make it happen.

But there's more to Sednaoui than acting and charity campaigns. A self-confessed nerd, she says that the current trend for teenage girls to value looks over brains is worrying and she hopes that they will realise that in life, intelligence is just as important as good looks.

Values: French actress Elisa Sednaoui says it's time to stop obsessing about looks and start valuing brains

'Life always ends up teaching us, one way or another, that without depth, beauty is worth very little,' she explains in an exclusive interview with MailOnline.

'It's much better to start being curious and asking questions about the world early on. Education is everything.'

The mother of a one-year-old son Jack, Sednaoui is outspoken about raising her son to respect women - and would even describe herself a feminist.

'I am a feminist in the sense that I believe that women are entitled the same rights and opportunities as men and are of equal value,' she says firmly.

'I will always be grateful to those women who fought for this, as I feel completely equal and I will do all I can to help women around the world to achieve the same.'

Passion: The Elisa Sednaoui Foundation aims to provide supplementary education for Egypt's poorest people

To that end, she has set up the Elisa Sednaoui Foundation, which provides after-school tuition to girls and boys in Egypt - a country close to the part-Egyptian Sednaoui's heart.

'In Egypt, women can work outside the home, go to school and university, and are free to vote or run in elections,' she explains.

'But in education and the labour market, women still lag behind. Women are four times more likely to be unemployed than men.'

Keeping track of women's progress in the country is difficult because, as Sednaoui points out, the majority either work at home or have an informal role in the work place.

This is something that she hopes to fix and to that end, she is currently working on a campaign to raise awareness of their plight and funds to support her foundation's work - all with a little help from Louboutin.

Exciting stuff: Elisa hopes that her charity will be able to help more children go to school like this group

Together, the pair are running a social media campaign which encourages women to post pictures of themselves and their shoes on Instagram and make a donation at the same time.

Those with the most exciting pair of shoes will be entered into a competition to win an all-expenses paid trip to Paris to tour Louboutin's studio, escorted by Sednaoui.

Her charitable ambitions, always bubbling under the surface, have become more urgent since becoming a mother in part, she says, because of the way parenthood has turned her into a more empathetic person.

'Becoming a mother has given me more empathy,' she beams. 'More understanding, more tolerance with myself and others. Its a thrilling experience to rediscover the world through his eyes'

Nevertheless, despite being a good example of a woman who has used her brains as well as her beauty to get ahead, she remains concerned about the way celebrity is fetishised and seen as an end in itself by today's teenagers.

'Celebrity is by no means a goal in itself,' she says. 'Unfortunately I feel young people are confused about this today. 

'The most important is being able to do what makes you happy - not having a paparazzi chasing you.' 

Big plans: Elisa, who says becoming a mother made her more empathetic, says celebrity is not a real goal

Set up to provide creative after-school activities to deprived Egyptian children, the Elisa Sednaoui Foundation is now an important part of the actress' life.

Focusing on cultural exchange and life skills, the charity aims to give girls' education a boost in a country where many women still lack the life chances of their male counterparts.

Celebrity supporters include Christian Louboutin, who has teamed up with Elisa for a new campaign to raise funds for the charity, and is offering a prize of an all-expenses paid trip to his Paris atelier, a signed pair of stilettos and a luxury spa experience for one lucky winner.
