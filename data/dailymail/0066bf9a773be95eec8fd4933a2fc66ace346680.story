A barrister who obtained a
council flat and sub-let it while already owning two homes has been jailed 
for seven months today.

Nadine Wilson-Ellis, 35, told officials she was a penniless unemployed 
single mother and  was given a council 
flat in Bristol which she then illegally sub-let for £100-a-week.

The mother-of-two - who earned £30,000-a-year as a legal lecturer - lived 150 miles away with her husband in Nottingham in one of her two homes.

Locked up: Barrister Nadine Wilson Ellis obtained a council flat and sub-let it while owning two homes. She has been jailed for seven months

Wilson-Ellis - who recently qualified as a barrister - made £10,000 from
the scam which she used to pay the mortgages on her other homes which were worth £55,000 and £73,000.

She was only caught out when she asked Bristol City Council for a bigger flat.

Investigators
found she had falsified bank statements and a maternity certificate in 
an attempt to prove she was living in Bristol while she lived and worked
150 miles away.

She was teaching law full-time at a higher education college in Nottingham with a £30,000 salary.

Judge
Michael Longman jailed her for seven months at Bristol Crown Court today after she previously pleading guilty to two offences under the
Fraud Act.

He said: 'The effect was to provide you with 
accommodation that you did not need and that was in the place of someone
who was more deserving.

Scam: The mother-of-two was given this council flat in Bristol which she then illegally sub-let for £100-a-week while she lived with her family in one of two homes in Nottingham

'As to the harm [you caused] that too was 
high because your behaviour resulted in a more deserving candidate being
denied the accommodation that was offered to you.

'You brazenly lied in the face of the most damning evidence which fortunately the jury saw through.'

Prosecutors
on behalf of the council said the scam cost the taxpayer almost £75,000
- around £35,000 in investigation and court costs.

The council say because she had the flat they had to pay for a genuine claimant to live elsewhere at a cost of £39,000.

Had she pleaded guilty at the first hearing, court costs would have been just £3,700.

The
court heard she applied for a council house in September 2008, but used
forged bank statements showing an address in Bristol, and a form which 
had false information about her job.

Wilson-Ellis then applied for a 
bigger council house in Bristol in September 2011, again giving false 
information about her address and income.

Jailed: Wilson-Ellis - who recently qualified as a barrister - made £10,000 from the scam which she used to pay the mortgages on her other homes. Wilson-Ellis owns this property in Nottingham

She has since lost her job as a result of the court proceedings, and is now on benefits and going through a divorce.

Wilson-Ellis
was sentenced to seven months in prison and wailed loudly as she was 
led down to the cells, while members of her family blew kisses to her.

Prosecuting,
Alan Fuller had asked the judge to order Wilson-Ellis to pay back some 
or all of the council’s costs, but the judge declined to impose that 
punishment.

Bristol’s Assistant Mayor Gus Hoyt, responsible for 
neighbourhoods and council housing, accused her of a 'shocking abuse of 
the system'.

He said: 'It is hard to think that our investigation 
officers will come across a worse example of fraud. Tenancy fraud is 
theft, pure and simple.

Homeowner: This shows another of Wilson Ellis's properties in Nottingham

'It robs those who are in genuine need of social housing of a precious and scarce resource.

'There
are currently more than 14,000 people on the waiting list in Bristol. 
The need for social housing has never been greater. This was 
scandalous.'

If Wilson-Ellis had not been caught she would 
eventually have qualified for the right to buy a larger council house in
Bristol, depriving a family in genuine need of much sought-after social
housing.

Speaking during her trial, Wilson-Ellis told Bristol Crown 
Court she had not rented out her council flat and insisted the tenant 
was a friend.

She claimed: 'The lady who stayed with me was not living there.

'She
was paying me back. I had leant her some money previously, to help her 
out so she could help her mum out back in Jamaica for her mum’s 
surgery.'

Defending Wilson-Ellis, Shahida Begum said her client did not financially benefit from the scheme.

Miss Begum said: 'When she came to Bristol she did just want a haven away from her ex-partner.

'She has lost her job. She has had to put in a claim for income support because she has no other means.

'She is extremely remorseful.'
