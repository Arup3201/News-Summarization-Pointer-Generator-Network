Skills Minister Matthew Hancock missed his chance to publicise a flagship policy to help unemployed youths become more employable - by oversleeping.

The red-faced minister was spurned by ITV's Daybreak after he was late for his primetime breakfast slot just before 7am.

He has admitted that he could not get out of bed on time, despite the broadcaster sending a chauffeur-driven executive car to get him from his West London home.

Skills Minister Matthew Hancock missed his chance to publicise a flagship policy to help unemployed youths become more employable - by oversleeping

Minister Matthew Hancock failed to turn up for his appearance on ITV's Daybreak, leaving Ian Pattison of Youth Fight for Jobs, pictured, as the sole interviewee

His gaffe -dubbed somnishambles and lategate on Twitter - comes after Chancellor George Osborne admonished people who stayed home with their curtains drawn.

Mr Osborne - who used to employ Mr Hancock as an adviser before the young minister was elected in 2010 - had spoken of the injustice felt by 'the shift-worker, leaving home in the dark hours of the early morning, who looks up at the closed blinds of their next-door neighbour sleeping off a life on benefits.'

Mr Hancock yesterday confessed that he was catching up on some shut-eye when he missed his chance to trumpet an apprenticeship scheme aimed at 16 to 24 year olds.

And he also tried to turn the blunder into a lesson for shirkers. 'I was 30 seconds late for my interview at 6.40 this morning, so they wouldn't let me into the studio to make my case,' he said. 

'It proves the point: you've got to be on time for work or there are consequences. I'll learn from my own example.' 

The government has tried to drum into young people the importance of punctuality in the workplace.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has also highlighted the plight of 'alarm clock Britain'.

But Mr Hancock appeared to have hit the snooze button when the driver had to wake him yesterday THURS morning.

An ITV source said: 'It is not as simple as being late by 30 seconds, you can't just get to the studio and expect to rush straight on the screen. If a guest is late, it causes huge stress for everyone. We have rejig the format or get the presenters to fill airtime. On this occasion, the item went out with just one side of the argument being presented.' 

The source added that Mr Hancock had 'at least been contrite and his office did apologise'.

Mr Hancock was supposed to go on air with Ian Pattison, from the pressure group Youth Fight for Jobs.

After the ministerial no-show, Mr Pattison accused him of double standards.

'If the Minister was a jobseeker, he could lose his benefits for up to three months for such an offence. Luckily, the Tory MP doesn't have to worry about things like that.'
