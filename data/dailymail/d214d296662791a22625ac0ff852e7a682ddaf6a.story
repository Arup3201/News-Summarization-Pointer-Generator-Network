Sale have tied down young prospects Mike Haley and Josh Beaumont to new two-year deals.

The duo are both highly rated with the Aviva Premiership club, who currently lie fifth in the standings ahead of their clash with Leicester on Saturday.

Haley, 20, has displaced Italy international Luke McLean as full-back and 22-year-old Beaumont, son of former England captain Bill, is a regular in the number eight role.

'Josh and Mike are both great lads and we are delighted they have both agreed their new deals with the club,' said Sale director of rugby Steve Diamond.

'Josh is a like a sponge in that he soaks up all the information. He's thriving on the responsibility.

'Mike's another who has seized his opportunity with both hands. Nothing fazes him and he has kicked on massively keeping a current international out of the starting side.

'Both lads have taken their opportunities and if they carry on performing like they have done then they know they will stay in the team.'

The Sharks are attempting to tie down their young talent, with hooker Tommy Taylor signing a fresh 12-month deal last week.

Josh Haley, who was recently praised by Sale director of rugby Steve Diamond, has also signed a new deal
