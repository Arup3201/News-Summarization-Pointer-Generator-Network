While pandas are often criticised as slow, lazy and maybe not the brightest of the bears, the young ones at a Chinese breeding centre are far from that, when motivated enough. 

In their case, the lure of milk in a neighbouring enclosure is enough to inspire a bit of extra effort from these giant pandas who manage to contort their cumbersome bodies through cell-like bars. 

These pieces of  footage comes from CCTV cameras behind the scenes at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.

The centre is the same one that tourists can go to if they want to volunteer to be a panda keeper for the day for about £35, with a one-minute cuddle with one of the teenage bears an added bonus for £200. 

And for superfans of the cuddly panda, the cameras show rolling footage of the animals online.

Known as PandaCam, the cameras broadcast the daily lives of the animals around the world, allowing viewers to flick between cameras in the cages of both youngsters and adults with their babies.

Footage shows how curiosity gets the better of the pandas as they squeeze through the bars of neighbouring cells.

The first clever one has no problem getting next door without the key on New Year's Day 2014, and shows how much fluff makes up its body mass while going through the metal bars.

Of course, it's not so easy for some, especially if they try to go back the other way.

Footage of another from December 17, 2013, is a little tough to watch given how cute the creature is as its head gets stuck.

This giant panda makes the mistake of, once getting his head through the bars, attempting to retreat. 

Its friends on the other side first come over to help - or play, it's hard to tell - before a keeper notices the predicament and decides pulling the head through would work. It didn't. 

In the end, the keeper urged the panda to continue on the originally desired path and soon all the pandas were together on the same side of the bars, with the stricken one looking a bit exhausted.
