When it comes to regrets, the fox in the box has a few – possibly starting with the label given to him by Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger.

Injuries, expectations, attitude. Three words to sum up why a career that promised so much for Francis Jeffers ultimately disappointed.

These days Jeffers’s main claim to fame is to be compared to Wayne Rooney and cited as an example of how two teenage prodigies from the same neck of the woods could take such diverging paths.

England captain Rooney, 28, celebrates his 100th cap against Slovenia on Saturday while Jeffers, 33, is back on Mersyeside learning how to be a coach.

They both made their Everton debuts at 16 although Rooney was 38 days younger.

They made their England debuts in the same match, a 3-1 defeat by Australia in 2003. Jeffers never played for the seniors again.

Yet for a while it looked as if Jeffers was destined to be as big a star as Rooney eventually became.

When Wenger paid £8million for him in 2001, he was supposed to be the English bees knees, the final piece of the Arsenal jigsaw.

Three years later he was on his way to Charlton for £2.4million. Two FA Cup medals were in the trophy cabinet although injury meant that Jeffers was not part of the final match-day squad on either occasion.

Jeffers built up his reputation as a youngster at Everton and signed for Arsenal for £8million

Jeffers praises Arsene Wenger for being honest with him and admits he looks back on his career with regrets

Jeffers scored four goals in 22 Premier League appearances for the Gunners and was sold soon after

During his time at Arsenal, Jeffers was linked to many clubs with wages a stumbling block. These words from David Gold, then co-owner of Birmingham, could almost have been prophetic.

He said: ‘If he wants to sit at Arsenal on his big contract and play golf every day, rather than get on with his career, then he can continue with that.

‘Jeffers has got at most 10 years left - and losing something like 150 grand a year is not something I would see as a good career move to be honest.

‘But if the alternative is sitting on your backside doing nothing, where is the motivation in that?’

Good question and one that Jeffers answers honestly.

‘I was out, partying, living life – tossing it off in training because I always thought I wouldn’t play Saturday anyway. Now I look back with a lot of regrets,’ he admitted to the Independent.

‘That is where I should have been putting it in more. Arsène Wenger gave me a fair crack of the whip. I haven’t got a bad word to say about him. He tells you how it is, one of the only managers I played for who did.

Rooney, unlike Jeffers, didn't score in the game against Australia but has been a revelation ever since

‘He said there were things going on in my head that shouldn’t have been and that it was an important time in my career. I am not saying I threw it all away because I had a decent career. I fulfilled a lot of ambition but I always say it, I know how much ability I had. I’m not soft. I know how good a player I was. One England cap wasn’t enough.’

In Jeffers’s defence, his body let him down too. Ankle and shoulder injuries struck on what became a long and winding road from Charlton, to Blackburn, to Sheffield Wednesday, to Newcastle United Jets in Australia, to Motherwell, to Floriana (Malta) and to Acrrington Stanley.

There was a loan move to Rangers in there, too, but what should have been a six-month stint was cut short.

‘For some reason, even towards the end when my career was fizzling out, the press have always taken a big interest in me and what I did,’ Jeffers added.

‘I don’t know whether people think the same as I think which is: I should have been better.’

Injuries halted Jeffers' career, who had limited success with Charlton among with many other English sides
