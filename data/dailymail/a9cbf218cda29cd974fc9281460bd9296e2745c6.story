Reaction: David Puttnam said it was 'wrong' to argue filming in the Lords would belittle the place 

Film producer David Puttnam last night attacked the ‘forces of reaction’ at Westminster after peers refused to allow a new version of Tarzan to be filmed in the House of Lords.

Warner Brothers, the makers of the film, Tarzan The Untamed, had planned to use the ornate Chamber because in the original Tarzan Of The Apes novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the hero is the son of a British lord and lady.

But after peers rejected the move amid fears it would ‘demean’ the Chamber, Lord Puttnam, whose films include The Mission and Chariots Of Fire, issued a scathing attack. 

The Labour peer said it was ‘wrong’ to argue that filming in the Lords would belittle the place. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, he said it was a ‘ludicrous’ argument to make.

Lord Puttnam stressed he had no involvement in the film, which will star Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgard in the title role, and had only proposed the Lords plan as he is unpaid chairman of Film London, a not-for-profit agency which promotes the capital as a venue for movie-making.

But he added: ‘There are always the forces of reaction. In the end, you have to overcome them.’

Labour peer Lord McAvoy, who led opposition to the idea, said commercial filming in the House of Lords would ‘diminish the Chamber’.

But another peer told The Mail on Sunday: ‘This is ridiculous. It’s not as though they were asking permission to swing on a rope from one side of the Chamber to the other.’ 

Until recently, commercial filming was banned across the entire parliamentary estate.

But 12 months ago, MPs relaxed the ban in the Commons in a move designed to help pay for repairs to the increasingly run-down Palace of Westminster.

The Lords’ administration and works committee followed suit a few weeks ago, and approved the specific Tarzan request from Lord Puttnam only for it to be rescinded later by a more senior committee.

The new film, featuring Wolf Of Wall Street star Margot Robbie as Jane, will be the latest of dozens of movies based on the original 1914 novel. The full cast list will be published tomorrow.
