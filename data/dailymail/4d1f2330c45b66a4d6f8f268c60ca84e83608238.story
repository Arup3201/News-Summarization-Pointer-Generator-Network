The mother of an 11-year-old boy who tried to kill himself after classmates taunted him for wearing a My Little Pony backpack has revealed she was planning her son's funeral.

Michael Morones' mother Tiffany found her son at their family home in Raleigh, North Carolina, after the suicide attempt in February.

He had been constantly bullied at school for being a fan of the cartoon and would tell his mother he was tired of being 'ugly and stupid'.

Oxygen to his brain was momentarily cut off after he tried to hang himself and doctors believes he could now be suffering from locked-in-syndrome.

Teased: Michael Morones was bullied over his love for My Little Pony and tried to commit suicide

Devastated: Mother Tiffany Morones-Suttle, pictured with stepfather Shannon Suttle, said she was planning her son's funeral at one stage

Despite the terrifying experience, his 
mother reveals he is 'getting better every day'.

Speaking to The Huffington Post, Mrs Morones-Suttle said: 'It's insane to think that we are even here.

'Sometimes our kids think they're strong and they're tough and they can handle everything, but as a parent it's our job to say, "You know what, this is something I get to handle for you."'

She admitted her loneliest moment came when she started making arrangements for her son's funeral, but now the family are committed to getting his life back on track.

'He gets a little better every day, but there is still a long road ahead of him.'

But she said it was a constant struggle because she has 'no idea what he is thinking or going through.'

After a visiting a neurlogist last week, she was told her son could be suffering from locked-in syndrome, meaning he struggles to communicate and could be completely paralysed.

Speaking with Michael's stepfather, Shannon Suttle, she described how she would see stories similar to her son's and ask herself: 'How does a child ever feel like that.'

A concert featuring stars such as Sir Ian McKellan and Sir Patrick Stewart was held in New York last night to help raise funds for Michael .

A website set up by his uncle has also helped increase awareness for his tragic story after going viral.

My Little Pony is a TV show about cartoon horses and has its own online forums including My Little Pony Reddit.

But fans of the show say they are being subjected to bullying and harrassment since the forums went viral. 

A documentary was recently made called My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic which tells the story of men who are fans of the show and call themselves Bronies.

However, they keep their love for the show a secret for fear of reprisals. 

At the time of Michael's suicide attempt, Mrs Morones-Suttle told WTVD: 'He would come home and say mum I'm tired of people being mean to me. That I'm ugly and stupid. 

'It breaks my heart that people have no sense of community or respect or boundaries.

More than 5,000 children between the ages of 10 and 14 have attempted suicide in the US so far this year, according to figures.
