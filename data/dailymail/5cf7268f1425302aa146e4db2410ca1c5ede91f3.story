It could almost be called the Mystery of the Missing Jewels as an Agatha Christie fan  found a strongbox full of the crime writer's jewels.

The story begins in 2006 when Jennifer Grant, a fan of the crime writer, bought a travelling trunk for £100 during a house clearing sale of the Devon home of Dame Agatha.

The house - Greenway, near Brixham in Devon - had been left to Dame Agatha's daughter Rosalind Hicks and was sold upon her death on October 28, 2004.

Two of the pieces of jewellery formerly owned by Dame Agatha Christie that are being auctioned by Bonhams in October, after being found in a trunk bought during a house sale of the crime writer's f

Inside the trunk, which belonged to Dame Agatha's mother, Clara, was a locked strongbox which the new owner opened four years later finding a purse of gold coins, a diamond brooch and a diamond ring. 

The jewellery, valued at around £10,000, is being sold at auction in October after lying unseen for years at Christie's family home.

Miss Grant said: 'I was thrilled to have stumbled upon my very own mystery. I always wondered what was locked inside the strongbox but I never dreamt it would be anything so exciting as diamonds - I could hardly breathe when I unwrapped the tissue paper and found them.

Greenway, near Brixham in Devon was crime writer Dame Agatha Christie's summer home. She described it as 'the most beautiful place in the world'

'As an Agatha Christie fan, it's wonderful to think that these items actually touched her life. I've enjoyed the jewellery greatly over the last four years but I don't wear it as much as it deserves. I thought - why not let someone else enjoy them.'

Dame Agatha used Greenway, which she described as 'the most beautiful place in the world', as a holiday home.

The house was used to film David Suchet's last appearance as Poirot on ITV last year.

The jewels will be sold at Bonhams auction house in Knightsbridge, central London, on October 8.

The first mention of the house situated on the River Dart is in 1493 when it is called Greynway.

The present house dates to the late 18th century and was bought by Agatha Christie and her husband Max Mallowan in 1938. They lived there until their deaths. She described it as 'the most beautiful place in the world'.

Greenway was acquired by the National Trust in 1999 and it is now a Grade II* listed building. Dame Agatha used the house or its environs in some of her books including Five Little Pigs (1942), Towards Zero (1944) and Dead Man’s Folly (1956). 

They are mentioned in the Agatha Christie biography as pieces earmarked for the novelist and her sister Madge to inherit from their mother's collection.

Dame Agatha wrote: 'My mother's valuable jewellery consisted of "my diamond buckle", "my diamond crescent" and "my diamond engagement ring" ... Madge was to have the diamond crescent, I was to have the diamond buckle...'

'...my mother sorted amongst an array of odds and ends... all these required hours of sorting before they were packed in the trays in the various trunks.'

Greenway features in several Agatha Christie novels, with its secretive walled gardens, tennis court and boat house on the river which wraps itself around the property.

The 19th century diamond brooch found in the trunk is expected to reach between £6,000 and £8,000 at auction, while the diamond three stone ring has an estimate of £3,000 to £5,000.
