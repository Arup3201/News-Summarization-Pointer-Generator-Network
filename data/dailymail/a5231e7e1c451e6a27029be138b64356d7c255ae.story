The British double agent who foiled the ‘underwear bomb plot’ could receive millions of dollars for carrying out his daring mission, a former top CIA official said last night.

The man is likely to receive the cash from the American authorities for risking his life infiltrating Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

His family will also be relocated to ensure their safety.

Plotter? Senior Al Qaeda leader Fahd Al-Quso, killed on Sunday by a drone strike, was believed to be behind the updated underpants bomb plot

Yesterday it emerged that MI6 gave the Saudi-born spy UK citizenship specifically for the mission.

By holding a British passport, he 
would have been a more attractive Al Qaeda recruit, as he would have 
been able to travel to the US without a visa.

Phil Mudd, a former deputy director of
 the CIA’s counter- terrorism centre, said there was no doubt the spy 
and his family would be financially secure for the rest of their lives.

He said: ‘He’s going to get a pay cheque that you or I would want any day of the week. We’re talking millions.’

According to reports from the US, the 
CIA was involved in the operation so it is likely the money will come 
from them, or possibly the FBI.

It is unclear whether British intelligence services will also contribute to the pay-off.

The agent’s extraordinary role was 
revealed earlier this week when it emerged he had thwarted an alleged 
plot to send an ‘undetectable’ bomb on a plane bound for America.

The device would have been a more 
advanced version of the one used by the ‘underpants bomber’ Umar Farouk 
Abdulmutallab in the failed Christmas 2009 plot.

Instead of boarding a jet and setting the device off, the double agent flew out of Yemen and gave it to his handlers.

His pay-off reflects the extreme 
personal danger he put himself through when he spent months undercover 
in Yemen. The exact sum is unlikely to be disclosed, but could include 
the reward for providing information which led to the US drone strike 
which killed Al Qaeda commander Fahd al-Quso.

The bounty for information leading to his capture was posted by the FBI at £3.1million.

The agent is said to have been 
recruited by MI6 for an operation to target Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, the
 Al Qaeda master bombmaker.

The spy had fallen in with jihadist 
sympathisers and was ‘turned’ around a year ago in an operation that 
involved Saudi intelligence agencies. He was sent to Yemen when it 
emerged a definite plot was under way and he volunteered to blow himself
 up on an America-bound jet.

According to the American news channel
 CNN, the device he was given was designed to be worn in a garment of 
some kind that would go over his underwear.

It used a chemical as a detonator that would have been undetectable by airport scans.

MI6 officials have confirmed that the agent was given British nationality for the mission.

The operation shows the close co-operation among the US, British and Saudi intelligence services.

On Wednesday, the Mail revealed how 
thousands of passengers flew to America from UK airports last week 
unaware they were being guarded by US air marshals, after the latest 
underwear bomb plot was smashed.

Security officials in America said 
hundreds of armed guards had been sent to Europe to accompany flights 
following reports that Al Qaeda was planning a ‘spectacular’ to mark the
 first anniversary of the killing of Osama Bin Laden by US special 
forces in Pakistan.

Dozens of transatlantic jets operated 
by British and American airlines are understood to have had at least one
 air marshal on board.
