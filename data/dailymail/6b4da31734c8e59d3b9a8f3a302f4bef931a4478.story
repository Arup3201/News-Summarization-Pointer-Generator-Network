New evidence has emerged of Russian military firepower on the streets of eastern Ukraine in the hands of pro-Moscow separatists, just as the new Ukrainian president has initiated a week long ceasefire.

Ukraine's defence minister claimed a
 total of ten BM-21 vehicles crossed the border into the hands of 
separatists, and said there was definite evidence that they were of 
Russian origin.

Two T-64 tanks and five armoured personnel carriers were also pictured entering the city of Lugansk close to the Russian border.

Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko announced a week-long unilateral ceasefire would begin Friday in the separatist east to give the pro-Russian rebels a chance to disarm.

'Today, on June 20, the ceasefire should begin. It will last until June 27,' he said on a visit to breakaway Donetsk region, his first since he came to power on June 7.

Few observers expect the rebels to lay down their arms in what is supposed to be the first part of his 14 point peace process.

Later it was claimed a fierce battle was underway at the city's strategic airport between Ukrainian troops and separatist fighters.

The photos have emerged a week after NATO issued a warning to the Kremlin that sending its tanks into Ukraine would mark a 'serious escalation' of the crisis.

Moscow insists its recent border swelling of troops is to combat weapons smuggled to separatists

The arrival of three tanks, pictured a week ago in separatist hands, caused shock waves since the deployment appeared to contradict Russian assurances to the West that it was seeking to diffuse tension

Defence minister Mykhailo Koval said there was 'operational information that ten BM-21 Grad military vehicle crossed the state border and are on the territory of Ukraine.'

One vehicle was seized and destroyed, he said.

'In the vehicle we found evidence that it belonged to the 18th Infantry Brigade from Chechnya, in the Southern Military District of Russia. There were notebooks, map lights and the seals of this brigade,' he said.

The US warned that Russia has re-deployed 'significant' military forces near its border with Ukraine and stockpiled additional tanks and artillery at a southwestern site.

The equipment and forces were being prepared by Moscow 'to provide active support for separatist fighters,' alleged a senior US administration official.

Washington is 'confident' that Moscow last week sent tanks and rocket launchers from the deployment site in southwest Russia into eastern Ukraine where pro-Russian separatists are battling to set up a state that would become part of the Kremlin empire.

A Kiev military expert warned of a 'stream of mercenaries and weapons from Russia' moving through the border

Some of the
 equipment was of the same type used by Ukrainian forces, an allegation 
that follows claims that Russian soldiers have been seen wearing 
Ukrainian uniforms.

'Separately we have information that Russia has re-deployed significant military to its border with Ukraine,' said the official.

America on Friday unveiled sanctions against seven key separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine.

Kiev
 military expert Dmitry Tymchuk warned: 'A stream of mercenaries and 
weapons from Russia keeps moving through the Dolzhansky border crossing 
point into Ukraine.

'Today another convoy of equipment entered in which at least three Grad multiple rocket launchers were identified.'

The unmarked arms are Russian in origin, according to Kiev.

Moscow
 insisted yesterday (FR) that a border swelling of troops - denounced by
 NATO - was undertaken to prevent the smuggling of weapons to 
separatists.

'We
 cannot speak of any concentration of troops other than measures to 
reinforce the protection of Russia's borders, which are being carried 
out on President Vladimir Putin's direct orders,' said his Kremlin 
spokesman.

The instruction 'was given several weeks ago' when the West complained about border breaches.

Ukraine's
 new Western-backed president Poroshenko yesterday unveiled a 
sweeping peace plan for curbing the violence tearing apart the ex-Soviet
 state which has seen at least 365 deaths.

The
 14-point scheme drops criminal charges against many fighters and 
establishes a six mile buffer zone around the border zone between the 
two countries.

It is far from clear that the plan will hold.
