What does your dream home look like?

From a converted warehouse in Melbourne's trendy South Yarra to a tropical tree-house in the balmy Top End. A space-saving beach-side semi in Sydney's popular Tamarama to a quiet mountain retreat at Hanging Rock in Victoria.

Here are the 13 incredible Australian houses in the running for the coveted 2014 National Architecture Awards. This year, you can help decide the the country's most beautiful designer home by casting your vote in the inaugural People's Choice Award.

The public can choose here from the judges' short-list of best new houses and renovations before October 29. 

Judges praised the Troppo Strohmayr House in the Northern Territory for its 'clever management of new and old and the variety of spatial events'

The Tamarama semi by David Langston-Jones (NSW) was described as a 'gem' by this year's jury. 'The design has a reverence for space and serves as a reminder that houses in Australia are, on average, much larger than they need to be,' said the jury

Bellevue Terrace. This transformed 1890s home in Western Australia has been called 'a handcrafted jewel' by the 2014 WA Architecture Awards Jury

The Southern Outlet House by Philip M Dingemanse 'deserves high recognition by virtue of its character: playful and confident, modest in size, yet bold in expression,' said the jury

'Considered and refined': The South Yarra Warehouse by NMBW Architecture Studio is praised for a simple design that 'celebrates' the building's history

House at Hanging Rock by Kerstin Thompson Architects is 'reminiscent of a mountain hut or shelter, a place of refuge and quiet – but still humble and part of the outside world,' say judges

Griffith House by Popov Bass Architects in NSW was praised for the close relationship between design elements and artistic outside landscapes

The jury described this Queensland Oxlade Drive house by James Russell Architect  as 'an intelligent, appropriate reinterpretation of the possibilities of inner city living'

'A sublime piece of architecture': The Highgate Hill House by Twofold Studio & Cox Rayner Architects, Queensland.

Cost effective: Hover House in Victoria by Bower Architecture

K House by Chenchow Little, NSW: 'A beautifully accomplished and confident building – a good testament to an adventurous architect and visionary client' said the Jury

 

Cosy stay: Lune de Sang - Stone House by CHROFI was designed for 'closeness and conversation' as an intended guest house, say the judges

Poetry: Judges described this Queensland 'West End Tower' by Owen and Vokes and Peters  as 'a poetic piece of architecture' that 'engages the senses'
