Israeli supermodel Bar Refaeli has split with her boyfriend Adi Ezra in a blazing row over Rolling Stones frontman Sir Mick Jagger - ruining her 29th birthday.

Bar recently admitted she was serious about Ezra and the couple were pictured on an intimate vacation in Thailand in March.

However, Israeli publications reported the couple split after Ezra accused the blonde of dancing too close to notorious womanizer Jagger, 70, with one claiming that he was so furious he grabbed Bar and pulled her off the dance floor at an exclusive Stones party.

Suddenly single? The X Factor Israel host reportedly split with her boyfriend Adi Ezra after he accused Refaeli of dancing too close to Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger at Yarkon Park in Tel Aviv

The couple were then heard having an argument and left the bash separately - and have not spoken since.

Bar - who was pictured partying with Jagger last year - and Ezra attended the Stones gig at Yarkon Park in Tel Aviv last Wednesday, celebrating the model's birthday.

The pair later joined the band at an exclusive after party at a restaurant called Mr. & Mrs. Lee. But Bar's birthday celebrations soon soured, allegedly fueled by Ezra's jealousy.

The Sports Illustrated beauty flew to Los Angeles at the weekend accompanied by her father Rafael, and her youngest brother, On, and the trio were pictured at the Jewish Life Foundation Salute to Hollywood Gala on Sunday.

Asked about the split, her mother Zipi Refaeli refused to comment, while Ezra said he did not comment on his personal life.

However, Bar - who dated A list star Leonard DiCaprio for four years before their split in May 2011 - made it clear she was serious about Ezra as she posed in wedding dresses for Hello! magazine in May and admitted she could hear wedding bells, saying: 'The wedding of my dreams is very simple, not a lot of people, not in a big place, maybe outdoors, barefoot.

'I'm in a relationship, there's a special guy in my life, we're not talking marriage yet.

''[I
 am] a romantic person, but a very solid romantic person.I like basic 
things - when somebody tells me he loves me, or when I say, 'I love 
you'. I really mean it, I don't just say it, so that's romantic to me.

'I
 don't need to go to the beach and have a picnic with wine in a basket 
to feel romantic. I feel romantic when I look into my boyfriend's eyes -
 that's enough for me.'

Meanwhile,
 Rocker Jagger has caused his own furore by seeming to be back to his 
womanizing ways just 11 weeks after the tragic suicide of his longtime 
love, fashion designer L'Wren Scott.

Serious: Bar Refaeli said she could hear wedding bells for her and Adi Ezra - however, their romance soured on her 29th birthday last Wednesday when Ezra is believed to have dragged her off the dance floor at an exclusive Rolling Stones party following their Tel Aviv gig - accusing her of getting too close to Mick Jagger

Beaming and looking relaxed, he threw his arm around Israeli model Noa Tishby following the Stones Tel Aviv gig.

Today, a pal of the singer conceded to the Daily Mail the pair have a flirtatious friendship, but added: ‘They got to know each other in Mustique but they are not  having sex, that one just likes the publicity.’ 

Fuelling rumours over their friendship, the brunette shared the image of the pair together with her 49,000 Instagram followers last week, writing: 'There's no way to post a picture like this without 
feeling a little douchy.

'However in the world of self aware name dropping, this may be the best one yet. So here goes.

'Thank you @mickjagger for amazing few days in Israel.

'Thank you for showing us all how to rock it like a legend. Thank you for being so generous with your energy, time, music.

'To say you're inspirational would be the understatement of the century.'

Her
 post came just days after Jagger was pictured with a dazzling young 
brunette on his hotel balcony in Zurich, Switzerland, whom he is 
believed to have picked up in a Zurich nightclub.

Wearing what appears to be one of his shirts, the singer’s companion was seen leaning in behind him and a friend said today:  ‘He has been up to his old tricks with women since the tour started a couple of weeks ago. There have been several already. Everybody is really pleased about it, delighted actually. It’s good to see him back in the saddle.

'The woman in Zurich, he picked up in a nightclub. It was just a passing fling and is over now and he has moved onto the next one.

'To Jagger, having sex is like taking a beer out of the fridge.'

As to the identity of the brunette, in some quarters she has been identified as a Russian ballerina, though there has been no corroboration of that suggestion. In any case, Jagger’s camp are quite sure the woman in question is, in their words, ‘a goner’, and has been discarded by the priapic frontman.

The source added: ‘I don’t think he will start another serious relationship for a long time because that would feel like a betrayal of L’Wren, but this sort of a fling does not.

‘He didn’t leak the Zurich girl on purpose, but the Stones camp and Mick are really quite glad that it’s out. Mick doesn’t want to be seen as some sort of broken old bloke who is on the look-out for his  next wife.’

But for the sister of L’Wren Scott, it is too much too soon.

Partner: L'Wren Scott was found dead in her Manhattan apartment in March. The couple had been together for 13 years and the rock legend was said to be 'devastated and distraught' at her death

Jan Shane attacked the Stones frontman, saying: ‘And people wonder why L’Wren was so depressed.’

Speaking
 from her Utah home, the  53-year-old, who was estranged from her 
sister, added: ‘These pictures make me really wonder what Mick is 
thinking  and feeling.

‘His
 daughter says that he is still heartbroken and so devastated about 
losing my sister. And then you see these  photos – he will never 
change.’

Miss Scott, 49, killed herself in March 
in her Manhattan apartment. There was no suicide note, but business 
records showed her design company, LS Fashion, had racked up millions of
 pounds of debt – a burden thought by friends to have caused her a level
 of distress that she kept private.

Miss
 Scott and Jagger were together for 13 years and the fashion designer 
was widely regarded as having tamed his roving eye. Following her death,
 Jagger was said to be distraught. In a statement, he said he could not 
understand  how his ‘lover and best friend could end her life in this 
tragic way.’

The Stones were
 forced to cancel the Australian leg of their tour  after the tragedy 
and resumed their concert dates only last month.
