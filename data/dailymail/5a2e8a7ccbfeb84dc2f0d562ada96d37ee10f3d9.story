The restaurant, known for its delicious food, is very popular in Jacksonville. But the owner said he was surprised that anyone would choose to rob him.

Jerome Brown told ActionNewsJax: 'Twenty years I've been here. [And this has] never happened.' 

Brown said the thief clearly had a taste for barbecued food because he took 'ribs, chicken, oil, baked beans, pork and beans, sausage and shrimp.' 

And that's not all. 

The bandit also reportedly stole Barbecue sauce, computers and a register and altogether he got away with items worth about $4,000.

Meanwhile the heist has come as a shock to customers who say they enjoy eating at the barbecue spot- but think the thief went too far. 

'The people worked hard to get where they're at. I don't understand why anyone would do something like that,' Kaylah Yarberry said.

Security: Brown said the restaurant has surveillance cameras, an alarm and locked doors but that did not deter the suspect, seen here,

According to Brown the restaurant has surveillance cameras, an alarm and locked doors. 

But that didn't stop the determined crook. 

Brown believes the thief even brought a truck to haul away his loot which he may sell.

The restaurant said that it is now busy attempting to restock the items that were taken.

And if the thief is caught, Brown hopes law enforcement will prosecute the thief.

Brown's alarm company, ADT allegedly said it sent Brown a text when the alarm went off but did not call police.
