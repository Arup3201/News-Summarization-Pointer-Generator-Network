Emma Foster describes the moment her daughter Lauren was diagnosed with cancer as like stepping on to a rollercoaster.

But now, two years on, the 12-year-old is free of the disease – thanks to a new type of highly targeted radiotherapy at the cutting edge of cancer technology.

Proton-beam therapy is already paid for by the NHS for certain rare cancers, but patients have to travel to the US for treatment. Now it is set to come to Britain, after a Government pledge of £250 million this summer to build two proton therapy centres, due to open in 2018.

Success story: Lauren Foster, 12, is now in remission from tissue cancer thanks to a new type of highly targeted radiotherapy

The pioneering technology kills cancer cells in a similar way to conventional radiotherapy but uses proton beams instead of X-rays. Protons are tiny positively charged particles found in the centre of atoms that are generated and focused into beams in large particle-accelerators called cyclotrons.

But unlike X-rays, proton beams release their energy only when they reach their target – meaning much less damage to surrounding healthy tissue.

That reduces the long-term side effects of treatment, which is particularly important for children. Lauren, who had a rare tissue cancer called Rhabdomyosarcoma, was an ideal candidate.

Her cancer affects about 60 children in the UK each year and develops from muscle or fibrous tissue in any part of the body.

Lauren’s tumour was at the back of her
 palate, meaning surgery wasn’t a viable option. Its proximity to her 
eyes and nose made the pinpoint accuracy of proton-beam therapy 
extremely beneficial.

‘I’d never heard of proton-beam therapy before,’ says Emma, a medical secretary.

‘When the doctor told us it was 
available only in America, I immediately thought of the cost and how we 
could afford it, but the doctor said that if the panel decided it was 
the best option for Lauren, the NHS would pay for it.’

The
 panel agreed, and in March 2012 Lauren travelled to the US with her 
parents Emma and Stephen  and younger sister Holly.

Lauren had 28 
sessions over a nine-week period, which fell halfway through her six 
months of chemotherapy.

Proton therapy is done in tandem with chemotherapy and its timing in the cycle is crucial.

The
 treatment is ‘posh radiotherapy’, according to Dr Adrian Crellin, the 
UK’s clinical lead on proton- beam therapy. ‘It’s unlikely that it is 
going to cure any more children with cancer but it reduces the chances 
of long-term side effects and secondary cancers in later life.

But in 
adults with some rare cancers like sarcomas of the skull and spine, 
proton therapy can mean an increased dose of treatment can be directed 
at the tumour, potentially curing more patients.’

Each
 treatment room costs about £20 million, more than ten times the cost of
 the linear accelerators used in conventional radiotherapy.

The
 NHS has been sending patients to two centres in the US – in Oklahoma 
and Florida – since 2008, at a cost of £97,500 per patient. Once the 
machines begin operating in this country, these costs should drop to 
about £40,000 per patient.

‘It is an expensive treatment but at the moment a significant proportion of the cost is travel, accommodation and chemotherapy in America,’ says Dr Crellin, whose team have reviewed 504 potential patients since it became available on the NHS in 2008. Of those, 383 have been approved,  70 per cent of them children.

Lauren’s treatment began with surgeons inserting tiny beads, known as fiducial markers, into the surface of her skull. These show up on the scan and enable the radiographer to target the proton beams precisely at the site of the tumour.  A custom-made mask was fitted over Lauren’s face to keep her head in place for each 40-minute session.

‘I was worried about how Lauren would cope and if she’d be able to stay still for so long,’ says Emma. ‘We thought she might need to have each session under general anaesthetic [as some youngsters do], but she did brilliantly.’

 Lauren recalls: ‘It was a bit scary at first but I got used to it. By the end I sometimes felt so ill I couldn’t even be bothered to feel emotions.’

A side effect is that the beams burn the area targeted. Lauren’s throat became so sore after two weeks that she had to be fed through a tube for the final five weeks.

‘She was very weak,’ says Emma. ‘Those last weeks were the worst of my life. It was awful. We were so isolated and at the weekends when Lauren had a break from treatment, we would just sit in the hotel room counting down the hours. Lauren would sleep or just sit there.’

The new UK centres – one at Manchester’s Christie Hospital and the other at UCL Hospital, London – will mean patients can be treated closer to home. And the number treated is expected to rise from 79 NHS referrals last year to 1,500 annually.

Some medics are sceptical about how many people will be eligible  for the technology, and last month’s report making the case for the Christie said there are ‘considerable risks in ensuring patient numbers’.

But Dr Crellin says this is because proton-beam therapy is still in its early stages. ‘It’s for very specific rare cancers and we’ve got to be careful about raising false hope, but if you’re that patient it could make a huge difference to your prognosis.’

Proton-beam therapy is by no means a miracle cure as only one per cent of patients currently receiving radiotherapy are suitable. And it’s too early to say whether the children treated develop fewer long-term side effects. But for Lauren’s family, the verdict is a positive one. Last summer, scans revealed that her tumour had disappeared.

Lauren still has scans every six weeks but started secondary school in September and is thriving. ‘We feel privileged to have had the best treatment money can buy,’ says Emma.

Lauren Foster was nominated  for a Cancer Research UK Little Star Award in partnership with TK Maxx. The awards celebrate the courage of all children diagnosed with cancer. To nominate a Little Star, visit cruk.org/littlestar.
