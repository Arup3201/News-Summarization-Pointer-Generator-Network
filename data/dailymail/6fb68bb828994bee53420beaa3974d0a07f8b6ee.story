A former US nurse who searched for suicidal people online and encouraged them to kill themselves has been sentenced to 178 days in prison.

William Melchert-Dinkel was convicted in September of one count of assisting a suicide and one count of attempting to assist a suicide in the deaths of an English man and a Canadian woman.

The 52-year-old was sentenced to three years in prison, but he will not have to serve the prison term if he complies with conditions of probation that include the jail time. 

William Melchert-Dinkel (pictured in 2011 with his wife Joyce) was convicted in September of one count of assisting a suicide and one count of attempting to assist a suicide in the deaths of an English man and a Canadian woman

Prosecutors said William Melchert-Dinkel, was obsessed with suicide and got a thrill from preying on people in their most desperate hours.

They said he posed as a suicidal female nurse to win his victims' trust, then entered false suicide pacts and offered detailed instructions on how people could take their own lives. 

The convictions came after the Minnesota Supreme Court narrowed the state's assisted-suicide law and reversed earlier convictions.

Prosecutors say Melchert-Dinkel, of Fairbault, Minnesota was obsessed with suicide and hanging and sought out potential victims on the internet. 

When he found them, prosecutors say, he posed in chat rooms and in e-mails as a woman, using such names as ‘Li dao’ or ‘Cami’, playing the role of a compassionate friend, and offering step-by-step instructions on how they could take their lives. 

According to court documents, Mr Drybrough posted a message in a chat room, asking if anyone had instructions on how to hang oneself without access to something high.

He began receiving e-mails from ‘Li dao’ containing detailed instructions. 

The prosecutor in 2011 said that Mr Drybrough died by the hanging methods described by ‘Li dao.’

He said that in Mr Dryborough's last communication with Melchert-Dinkel he said he was scared and 'holding on to the hope that things might change'. 

In the Canada case, evidence shows Miss Kajouji went online saying she wanted to commit suicide but was afraid of failing.

Five days later, she participated in online chats with ‘Cami’ - who prosecutors say was actually Melchert-Dinkel, claiming to be a 31-year-old emergency room nurse.

During the chats, Miss Kajouji said she planned to jump into a river the following Sunday, and Cami said if that didn’t work, they would hang themselves together that Monday.

‘We are together in this,’ Miss Kajouji wrote.

‘Yes I promise, Monday will be my day,’ Cami replied. 

In September, Rice County District Judge Thomas Neuville ruled that Melchert-Dinkel had assisted in the suicide of Mark Drybrough, 32, of Coventry, England.

But he found the state had failed to prove he had done the same in the death of Nadia Kajouji, 18, of Brampton, Ontario, instead convicting Melchert-Dinkel of a lesser charge of attempting to help her take her life.

'I am sorry ... for my actions and what I have done,' Melchert-Dinkel said in court before he was sentenced.  'I have repented.' 

It was the second time Melchert-Dinkel was tried in the deaths.

In 2011 he was convicted under a law that made it illegal to 'advise' or 'encourage' suicides.

Melchert-Dinkel told police in  interviews that he did it for the 'thrill of the chase.'

Prosecutors said he acknowledged participating in online chats about suicide with up to 20 people and entering into fake suicide pacts with about 10 people, five of whom he believed killed themselves.

The judge in Minnesota at the time said he showed a minimal level of remorse despite admitting his deeds were 'dark' and 'disgusting'.

But in March 2014, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled the law amounted to an unconstitutional restriction on speech, reports the BBC.

Melchert-Dinkel remained free on appeal. 

The state tried him again, this time under a separate part of the law making it crime to 'assist' in a suicide if the speech is targeted at one person and provides someone with advice needed to kill him or herself.

'When Nadia died, the best parts of me died with her,' her mother, Deborah Chevalier, said during an emotional statement in court in 2011.

'What William Melchert-Dinkel did was vile, offensive and most importantly, illegal. 

'He knowingly chose to mastermind the deaths of some and destroy the lives of many.'

Kajouji's family talked of a bright woman who wanted to become a lawyer and mother, and had only become depressed after she went away to college. 

Six months after starting, she disappeared. 

Some family members at first thought she had been kidnapped, and told the court of the horror of searching for her for six weeks until her body was found.  

After Drybrough's death, police scanned his computer and discovered he sought advice online.

They later realised the person giving advice on how he should hang himself was Melchert-Dinkel, according to prosecutor.    

Melchert-Dinkel must report to jail October 24.
