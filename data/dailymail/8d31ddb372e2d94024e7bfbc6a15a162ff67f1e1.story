Phil Jagielka admits he got frustrated by the constant talk of John Terry returning to the England squad ahead of the World Cup.

Jagielka, who has finally recovered from a hamstring injury, has never been on the losing side for England in 10 starts alongside Gary Cahill.

Nevertheless, there had been calls for Terry, who retired from international duty in September 2012, to make himself available for Brazil.

The Everton centre half admitted: 'It's difficult. I can't say I like to hear it, but I understand why I do.

'Obviously Cahill and Terry play together at Chelsea, they play in the Champions League and were contenders to win the Premier League.

'As a defender, partnerships are important. If you have two players who work well together they may be a better bet than two superior players, so I can understand why people talk about Terry.

'England's defence in the qualifiers was pretty decent, but I can't decide what people ask. I stop, smile and get on with it.'

Terry, 33, has always insisted he would never come out of international retirement and head coach Roy Hodgson hasn't even discussed it with him.

Although England's defence does look vulnerable, Jagielka and Cahill will be Hodgson's first pick at the World Cup this summer.

The Everton defender has won 31 caps and is expected to face Peru in England's World Cup send-off at Wembley on Friday evening.

He added: 'I still find it difficult assuming I'm going to play for England but I've played quite a lot in qualifying and have built up a good relationship with Cahill.

'We haven't played together for a while and hopefully these three games will give us the chance to get that relationship going again. Being in the squad is great, but nothing beats starting games for your country. It's what we all want to do and it looks like I've got a good chance of doing that at the moment.'

Jagielka also mounted an impassioned defence of young English footballers after monitoring the progress of Everton midfielder Ross Barkley, plus Raheem Sterling and Luke Shaw this season.

The England defender watched Barcelona striker Gerard Deulofeu on loan at Everton last season and claims he is no better than young English players.

He added: 'Gerard came in and he was quite a selfish player but he has a tremendous amount of ability and went past people. We are probably taught to be less selfish but technically there is no difference.

'The ideal comparison is Raheem to Deulofeu and for me Raheem had the best season. That is a direct comparison.

'It is too easy to point the finger but if you take a step back to what we have got, we have some tremendously talented individuals.

'If you look at Ross, he has a good physique, is good in the air, eats the right food, and more importantly loves the game. You cannot get him off the training ground. He had a couple of injuries when he was younger which set him back a bit and he did not get to play that much football because he was not around the first team at a young age.

Looking good: Ross Barkley is one of the young England stars picked for the World Cup

'This season has proved how much he has grown mentally. He went through a bad period but the manager stood by him and he came out of it. He has got the whole package, but we don't want to put too much pressure on him. 'People compare him to Wayne Rooney but they are not the same players. In terms of mindset, they are the same.'

Jagielka missed three months of the season with a hamstring injury, but finally returned to the Everton team for the 3-2 defeat against Manchester City on May 3.

He added: 'I don't feel 100 per cent sharp but training with these extra layers on is perfect. I can only improve and hopefully if I can get some time on the pitch in these three games I'll soon be a lot fitter.'
