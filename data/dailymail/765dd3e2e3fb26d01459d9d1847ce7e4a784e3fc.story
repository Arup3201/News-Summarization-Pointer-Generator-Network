Thugs who repeatedly crashed a stolen lorry into the front of a house leaving it in danger of collapsing were being hunted by police tonight.

The three tonne flat-bed vehicle was believed to have deliberately ploughed into the two-bedroom semi-detached house, in what was thought to be an 'ongoing localised dispute'.

Neighbours reported hearing a noise 'like 
an earthquake' or a 'bomb going off' as the two balaclava clad men drove
 into the house three times before running away from the scene in Spondon, Derbyshire.

Damage: This two-bedroom house in Spondon, Derbyshire, was left on the verge of collapse after thugs repeatedly crashed a stolen lorry into it

The owners of the 
Â£120,000 property were not present at the time of the Bank Holiday 
attack, which took place at around 4.50am today.

Next door neighbour, Kay Nyakale, 23, said those living nearby were forced to flee their homes as it was feared the house would collapse.

'This is traumatic, to say the least,' he said.

'It's incredibly shocking, the house felt like an earthquake and it was shaking for a few seconds afterwards.

'I came outside and saw a lorry in the yard and the front of the neighbour's house was completely gone.

Scene: Police sealed off the road and launched a manhunt for the two suspects

'We were told to evacuate the house immediately and told it was a health hazard.

'I
 feel like a victim of this atrocious attack on the property, it's the 
most shocking thing that's ever happened outside my front door.'

Anne Byrne, 51, who also lives near 
the scene, added: 'I heard a bang last night and saw two or three men 
shouting - I don't know what it was about, but they got into a truck.

'It must have been one hell of a crash, it was like a bomb going off.'

Another
 eyewitness, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'I was coming back 
from being out in town and got out of a taxi as I live up the road from 
where it happened.

'As first we thought the van was just reversing but then we heard the hit going into the building.

'The
 taxi driver didn't want to let us out a first. It was scary. When it 
hit, it was a really loud bang, then men in balaclavas ran out of the van 
and into the house. I think there were four or five.

'They then came back out of the house with nothing and jumped into a car and drove off.'

Police sealed off the road and a man-hunt was immediately launched, but so far no arrests have been made.

Officers are now appealing for witnesses after the incident, which involved the lorry allegedly stolen from a waste management company in Staffordshire.

'Two men were seen to get out of the stolen vehicle and make off in a white van,' said a police spokesman.

'No one was in the house at the time and no one was injured.

'No weapons were used or seen.'
