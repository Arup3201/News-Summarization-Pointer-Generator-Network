HEARTBREAK FOR JERSEY GIRLS 

Jersey came within a whisker of ending their 24-year Commonwealth Games medal drought in women’s pairs bowls, but were edged out by Northern Ireland. Katie Nixon and Lindsey Greechan were heartbroken after being beaten to the bronze medal by Barbara Cameron and Mandy Cunningham. In the final, England had to settle for silver as Natalie Melmore and Jamie-Lea Winch lost to South African pair Tracy-Lee Botha and Colleen Piketh. 

LET THEM EAT CAKE 

After Wales women sealed ninth place in the hockey by thrashing Trinidad and Tobago 4-0 on Thursday, goalscorer Phoebe Richards posted a picture on Twitter. ‘Post-Commonwealth Games treats, muffins in the ice bath!’ was the accompanying message. Well deserved, ladies.

BOUCHARD DIVES TO GLORIOUS FIFTH 

Amid the excitement of Jack Laugher and Chris Mears’ gold medal in the men’s synchronised 3m springboard, the inspirational Maxim Bouchard slipped under the radar. Bouchard broke his arm, back, wrist and legs and split his head open when a 7m platform collapsed underneath him in 2010, and still has metal pins in his left arm. Bouchard and Ryan McCormick managed a fifth-place finish for Canada. 

ENGLAND SPOT ON AGAINST KIWIS 

A penalty shootout was required for England’s women to reach Saturday’s hockey final. Lily Owsley gave England a first-half lead against New Zealand, but the Antipodeans levelled with a minute to go. The teams had to settle for a shootout, which England won 3-1, thanks largely to the heroics of goalkeeper Maddie Hinch. Now all that stands between England and a gold medal is Australia, who beat South Africa 7-1 in the other semi-final...

High five: England put years of spot-kick heartache behind them to triumph 3-1 on penalties against New Zealand in the semi-final of the women's hockey after drawing 1-1

ANOTHER ALL-ENGLAND FINAL 

English mixed doubles pair Tin-Tin Ho and Liam Pitchford caused a huge upset in the table tennis semi-final, beating Singapore’s Jian Zhan and Tianwei Feng 12-10, 11-8, 11-13, 6-11, 11-5. Pitchford and Ho, who has a table tennis-obsessed father to thank for her first initials, will contest an all-England final on Saturday against husband-and-wife team Paul and Joanna Drinkhall, who defeated Danny Reed and Kelly Sibley in the other semi.

OUSEPH PULLS THE STRINGS 

English badminton player Rajiv Ouseph may not have had the crowd’s backing in his quarter-final against Glasgow’s Kieran Merrilees, but that didn’t stop him winning in emphatic fashion. Ouseph sewed up victory in 29 minutes, despite snapping his strings early on. ‘In our sport there’s only two people, so if you’re not winning you’re losing,’ is the Londoner’s motto. It served him well on Friday.

BID FOR BARROWMAN'S RANGE ROVER! 

Fans have been given the chance to bag themselves the ultimate souvenir from the Games — the 4x4 ridden by John Barrowman in the opening ceremony is being auctioned off. The bidding for the ‘Tartan Clad 2003 Ford Ranger’ is currently at £4,400 with 20 days left of the auction. Not a bad price for ‘the most recognised and sought after Ford Ranger ever’, according to the Commonwealth Games website anyway. 

JUST KEEP THE FAITH, VALENTINO 

Valentino Bon Jovi Bong may be leaving Glasgow without a medal, but he comfortably wins the competition for best name at the Commonwealth Games. The Malaysian squash player, who was eliminated from both the mixed and men’s doubles on Thursday, revealed the secret to his association with the 80s rockers: ‘I was born in 1989 when they were really big and my mum was a fan, so she decided to give me that middle name,’ Bong said.

Joy! Swimmer Adam Brown won gold and bronze medals at the Games and he now has a baby daughter too

BABY JOY FOR DOUBLE MEDALLIST

English swimmer Adam Brown now has a baby daughter to add to his gold and bronze medals from the Commonwealth Games. The 25-year-old, who medalled in the men’s 4x100m Medley and freestyle relays, missed his daughter’s birth as his wife went into labour four weeks early. The Alabama-based swimmer uploaded a picture of his new arrival to Instagram on his return to the States.
