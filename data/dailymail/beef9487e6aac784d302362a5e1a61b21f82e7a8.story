Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has expressed his disappointment in former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani for saying he doesn't think President Barack Obama loves the United States.

In an interview on CNN's State of the Union program, Johnson branded Giuliani's words 'very regrettable.'

'His comments were not helpful...And I'm sorry to see statements like that coming from the former mayor whose response to 9/11 in 2001 I admired very much,' Johnson said.

Criticism: Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has questioned President Barack Obama's love of his country

Johnson revealed he was once hired by fellow New Yorker Giuliani as a federal prosecutor and the two visited fire stations and police precincts in Lower Manhattan on the September 11 anniversary.

But while he admitted that he admired Giuliani's response to the 2011 attacks, he said he was sorry to see the former mayor make his recent statements. 

He added: 'I think his most recent statements are very regrettable.' 

The former mayor made his controversial remarks about the President Wednesday at a private dinner for Wisconsin's Republican Governor Scott Walker.

Giuliani said: 'I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the president loves America.'

Since facing a barrage of opposition over his comments Giuliani made an attempt to justify his claims saying it dates back to when the President was nine years old.

Giuliani said that the President's lack of affection for his country can be attributed to meeting Communist Party members when he was living in Indonesia 44 years ago. 

He suggested that Obama's meetings with Communist Party member Frank Marshall Davis, when the President-to-be was nine years old has affected his attitude towards America.

He told Fox News that he wasn't 'questioning his patriotism', but said his rhetoric did not convey the pro-American sentiment he had heard from Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. 

Yesterday Giuliani stood by his comments despite  receiving death threats on his voice mail in the wake of the controversial statements.

The former mayor did not say whether he contacted police about the threatening calls but told CNN that despite the criticism he has also received widespread support. 

Yet, Democrats, members of the GOP and the White House have condemned his comments. 

Deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said it was 'a horrible thing to say', while Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz said it was the time for Republican leaders to 'stop this nonsense.'  

White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, spoke Friday saying that he feels sorry for the man who was once known as 'America's mayor.'

'I can tell you that it's sad to see when somebody who has attained a certain stature and even admiration tarnishes that legacy so thoroughly,' Earnest said. 

But Giuliani hit back and told NBC Friday: 'I'm right about this. I have no doubt about it. I do not withdraw my words.'

'I do not detect, in this man, the same rhetoric and the same language, the same love of America that I detected in other American presidents including democrats.'
