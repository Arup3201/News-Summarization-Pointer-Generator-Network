A Delaware elementary school teacher found guilty of having sex with one of her 13-year-old students is trying to have her 10-year prison sentence reduced.

Rachel Holt was 34 when she was charged with 28 counts of raping a minor in 2006. She pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree rape and was handed a mandatory 10-year sentence.

Investigators said the science teacher had sex with the boy more than 25 times in just over a week, and on one occasion let his 12-year-old friend watch.

Appeal: Science teacher Rachel Holt is trying to have her 10-year sentence for rape commuted

The board of pardons is scheduled on Thursday to hear a commutation request from Holt, who used to work at Claymont Elementary School.

A previous request to have her sentence commuted was rejected in 2010.

At the hearing, deputy attorney-general James Kriner said: 'It hasn't been proven to my satisfaction that she doesn't pose a threat to other teenage boys,' according to the Star Democrat

Court documents showed that Holt had been disciplined by the school for 'inappropriate behavior' including sitting on the laps of male students, and driving them home in her car.

In January 2006, just a few months before she started having sex with a 13-year-old student, the school principal, Betty Pinchin, had received several complaints from parents about Holt.

The concerns included that the science teacher was 'instant messaging kids 10.00 at night' and 'becoming more of a buddy tha[n] a teacher'.

In March 2006 she was suspended for three days after a parent volunteer observed her kissing and hugging a student in the library.

She returned to work on March 16 and began a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old on March 24.
