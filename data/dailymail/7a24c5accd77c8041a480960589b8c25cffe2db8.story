Co-chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold have urged West Ham supporters to avoid any unwanted behaviour when they start their Barclays Premier League campaign at home to fierce rivals Tottenham on Saturday.

With the club having come under scrutiny in the past - anti-Semitic chanting and hisses have been heard, allegedly replicating gas chambers used during the Holocaust - the spotlight could again shift away from the on-field action.

But Sullivan and Gold, writing a message to fans on the club’s official website, are keen to avoid any further incidents which would portray West Ham in a bad light.

London affair: West Ham play host to north London outfit Tottenham on Saturday afternoon

Fierce encounter: Both sides will be looking to claim all three points in their opening match of the season

The statement read: 'West Ham United would like to thank all supporters who have purchased a ticket for Saturday’s season opening London derby with Tottenham Hotspur.

'The Hammers enjoyed three memorable wins against Spurs last season, with the resultant press coverage of each game rightly focusing on the action on the pitch three outstanding performances from the team.

'Saturday’s game is likely to be an immensely passionate affair and, as ever, we know both sets of fans will be providing plenty of vocal support for their team.

'However, West Ham United seeks to remind all home fans attending the match at the Boleyn Ground that they will be acting as ambassadors for West Ham United and their behaviour should reflect the values and standards of our club.

'We are proud to support causes that promote tolerance and inclusion and tackle discrimination in whatever form it takes.

'Therefore, any inappropriate behaviour is completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated by the club.

'Working with the Metropolitan Police, the club will continue to adopt a zero tolerance policy towards any form of discriminatory behaviour and any fan found to be acting inappropriately - including racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic behaviour - will be punished to the full extent of the law and banned from attending matches.

'Everyone at West Ham United is looking forward to the first game of the new season at the Boleyn Ground, where the famous Claret and Blue Army can show the world what being a Hammers fan is all about - supporting with pride, passion and respect.'

Tottenham also moved to stress the need for proper conduct from their travelling supporters.

A statement on the club’s website read: 'As we look forward to the Premier League season getting underway this weekend, we should like to remind all our fans making the trip for our season opener at West Ham United that the Metropolitan Police will adopt a zero tolerance policy towards any form of behaviour they deem to be discriminatory.

'All of our supporters travelling to Upton Park are doing so as ambassadors of the club and we would ask that they behave in a manner of which we can be proud.

'The club does not tolerate discrimination of any sort, on the pitch or in the stands, and we shall also take appropriate action against anyone heard using abusive, offensive or obscene language.

'Our fans generate a fantastic, positive atmosphere both at the Lane and on our travels and we hope everyone continues to focus their energies on cheering the team on.'
