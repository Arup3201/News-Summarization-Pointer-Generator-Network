Sometimes you've got to take the plunge, and that's certainly what this puppy did when it came to tackling stairs for the first time.

Chunk the English Bulldog was filmed as he sat on a step at home debating the best method of getting down.

After more than half-a-minute of hesitation, the gutsy pup pulls himself together and takes an enthusiastic leap.

He suddenly springs into the air and manages to make it over four steps.

Although a little unsteady on his feet, Chunk lands on all four paws, his wrinkly skin rippling with the fall. 

A woman filming the stunt is heard giggling as he goes.

In reward for his efforts,

Chunk gets a pat from his owner. 'That's a good boy,' the man says in an American accent.

Many viewers have said  their dogs have similar issues when it comes to stairs. 

One pet owner wrote: 'My Pom is terrified to go up the step to my apt building. It's one step, about three- to four inches tops.

'[But it] takes a good five to ten seconds to mentally prepare to launch himself.'

Plucking up courage: A new home video shows Chunk the English Bulldog hesitating as he tackles the stairs at home for the very first time - he tries to pop a paw down but the distance is too great

Born to fly: After more than half-a-minute of hesitation the pup suddenly takes a leap - in a flash he flies over four steps and lands on all four paws to get a well-earned pat from his owner
