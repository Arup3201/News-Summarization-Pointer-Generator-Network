Physically carrying your kids around is one thing, but lugging their combined weight on your own frame in extra pounds is quite another.

But  a mother-of-four has lost a whopping ten stone, the weight of her children put together after they spurred her on to beat the bulge.

Emily Rennie, 29, from Stafford, was encouraged by her three older children, Leo, 8 Libby, 6 and Taylor, 4, to stick to her diet after tipping the scales at 19st.

Dropped from 19st and a size 22 to 9st and size 10 by joining Weight Watchers and with the support of her children

Emily's total weight loss is equivalent to the combined weight of her children (L-R) Taylor, 4, Leo, 8, Joseph, 19 weeks and Libby,6

The adorable tots would cheer on their mother if she was doing well, and even warn her against eating less nutritious foods.

Now Emily has lost an impressive 10st, the same as her four children’s combined weight - despite becoming pregnant with baby Joseph, 19 weeks, during her weight loss - and now weighs in at a svelte nine stone.

Emily said: 'As soon as I joined Weight Watchers the kids were behind me every step of the way.

'They’d support me and tell me off if I went to get something unhealthy out of the fridge.

'Every time I had a weigh in they’d always ask me how I’d done and congratulate me.

'Now, when they see old pictures of me they don’t recognise the person as their mummy.

'I had my own little team to keep me going.

'I’m just so pleased I’ve been able to do this for them.'

Emily began to put on weight at the age of 17 after being diagnosed with Crohn’s disease.

'I was 17 when I was diagnosed with Crohn’s, and the medication made me gain quite a bit of weight quite quickly.

'Then after that I just got fatter and fatter.

'I just ate the wrong foods - I’d have takeaways and burgers and I’d snack on crisps and cake.

'If I ever felt hungry during the day I’d go to the fridge and just cut myself a chunk of cheese - I’d never do that now.

'Then I went onto have three children in the space of five years, and because I was pregnant I used it as an excuse to eat more.

'Before I knew where I was I weighed 19 stone.'

But after seeing an unflaterring photo of herself, Emily decided to join Weight Watchers.

Emily said: I’d tried other diets before, but this time I was determined

'I was a size 22 and even then I sometimes had to go up a size.

'When I saw the picture of myself, I just didn’t realise I was that big.

'But I took to Weight Watchers straight away, and actually found it easy.

'I lost the weight really quickly - I had to stop when I had Joseph but as soon as he was born I lost the baby weight and then some.'

As soon as Emily began dieting, her loving children were determined to help their mother, becoming her own personal support team.

Emily said: 'I explained to the children that mummy was going to start eating more healthily.

'At first there wasn’t much of a reaction but soon they really started to notice what I was doing and they were so positive.

The children became Emily's support team, cheering on her successes and discouraging her from eating bad foods

Having lost over six dress sizes, Emily is now swamped by her old trousers (left) while Leo, 8, and Libby, 6 can easily fit one in each leg (right)

'They’d tell me off I was going to give into a craving and eat something naughty, and Libby would always ask me how I was doing.

'I didn’t want to disappoint them so I knew I had to keep going.

'It’s been great for them as they understand the importance of being healthy and to eat good foods.'

Now, the children don’t recognise old pictures of their mother.

Emily said: 'The other day I was looking through some pictures and I asked Libby who the lady in the picture was.

Breakfast: Nothing

Lunch: Sandwich with crisps and chocolate bar

Dinner: Burger with chips

Snacks: Cheese, crisps and cake

Breakfast: Apple and banana

Lunch: Weight Watchers soup or ham salad sandwich

Dinner: Grilled chicken salad

Snacks: Weight Watchers biscuits

'She had no idea and was even more shocked when I told her it was me.

'It’s lovely to see how proud they are of me.'

Emily has now dropped an impressive six dress sizes to a size 10, and couldn’t be happier.

Emily said: 'I wish I’d done this years ago.

'Not only do I weight less, but I feel like a different person.

'I’m so much happier and healthier.

'Before I wasn’t active at all, but now I can run around after the kids all day long.

'I can’t thank them enough for helping me through - I hope I’ve made them proud.'
