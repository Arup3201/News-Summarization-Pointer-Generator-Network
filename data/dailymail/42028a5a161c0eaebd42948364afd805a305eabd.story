Sharing your life with someone used to mean sharing a home. But now as many as one in 20 couples to chose to live apart.

And according to Sarah Essig, it may just be the secret of a happy union.

This year she and husband Tom will celebrate their second wedding anniversary and both say they have never been happier.

Miles apart: Sarah and Tom Essig may live 3677 miles apart with her living in the USA and he in Dorset in the UK but they believe that's the secret to a happy marriage

But Sarah and Tom don’t just live in separate homes. They live in separate countries. Tom lives 3677 miles from Sarah’s Dorset home in Virginia, USA.

The happy couple have not ruled out living together in the future, but have no immediate plans to do so.

Sarah, 53, says: ‘ Yes it’s unconventional but it works for us and we are incredibly happy.

‘We love each other deeply and we are married and plan to spend the rest of our lives as a couple. Living in separate countries doesn’t make our relationship any less important. In fact it has benefits.

‘People can me quick to make assumptions about my marriage because my husband and I chose to live in separate counties, but I want people to know it can work.’

According to research the number of men and women living apart as couples has increased by 40 per cent in the last decade. It is estimated that one million couples now keep a separate property.

Long-distance love: The couple met on a cruise in 2008 and wed in summer 2011

But for Sarah, it wasn’t a lifestyle choice to live apart from the man she loves, more a matter of practicalities.

The couple met on cruise in 2008 shortly after Sarah’s marriage had ended.

Mother-of-two Sarah was holidaying with a friend while American widow Tom, now 59, was on aboard with his daughter when they got chatting at dinner.

Sarah says: ‘I certainly was not looking for a relationship and neither was Tom. I’d been through a divorce and he had recently lost his wife of 24 years to cancer.

‘But the more we talked, the more we connected and we ended up spending the whole holiday together talking.

‘We really understood each other and knew before the cruise ended that somehow or other we would remain in each others lives.’

In fact the couple met up again in London just a few weeks later.

‘It just affirmed what we already knew, that we wanted to be a couple. But we already knew that our situation – both of us having children that needed us in different countries – meant living together was not an option so we went into it with our eyes open.’

After meeting again the couple spoke constantly on skype – which Sarah describes as a ‘best friend’ for couples living or working in separate countries.

In the months that followed they planned more trips to see each other.

‘It meant the time we spent together was always quality time and we were always very excited about meeting up.

‘In the past my relationships have all been about stability and security but by the time I met Tom I already had that in my life and instead our relationship was more about fun, excitement and passion.

Sarah’s family situation made it impossible for her to consider moving to the USA with Tom.

Her marriage ended after ten years and her children now aged 12 and 16 remained in the home with their father while Sarah moved into a place nearby so she could still see them everyday.

‘I didn’t want to be selfish and cause any more disruption by insisting they leave their home to move into a new house with me.

Reunited: Tom wanted to remain close to support his children through college after their mother sadly passed away but he and Sarah take lots of holidays together when they can

‘But even though my children don’t live with me full time they are still my life and my priority.  Even when it became obvious my relationship with Tom was serious it never entered my head to move.

Similarly, Tom, a former Homelands security officer who now works as a security consultant, also felt he could not leave his two children.

Though older, they found it hard to cope with their mother’s death from cancer and Tom wanted to remain close to support them through college.

But that didn’t stop the couple getting married on July 11 2011.

‘We wanted to marry to show our commitment and also because it would make our trips to see each other easier when we went through customs – which was a lot, ‘ laughs Sarah.

‘We decided on a Vegas wedding with just the two of us present so our families could watch online without spending on expensive flights.’

Their honeymoon was their eighth cruise together after which they returned home alone.

‘Yes there are times when it is hard, but it’s no different for couples in the Armed Forces. You get used to it.

‘I’m sure some people thought we were barmy getting married while living in different countries with no intention of sharing a home, but so what?

It must be love: Sarah took redundancy from her job as a graphic designer to be free to visit Tom more often

Cruising: The couple are currently planning their 13th cruise together

‘He is the man of my dreams and we’re happy so who can judge that.’

Sarah took redundancy from her job as a graphic designer to be free to visit Tom more often.

The couple say they make their marriage work by spending at least half an hour a day ‘ together’ talking on their webcams.

‘The time zone can be tricky to manage because when it’s evening here Tom is just waking up so we might be in different moods but we are used to that now.

At the moment they are planning their 13th cruise together over two weeks in April.

‘I can’t wait to see Tom and I know we will have a fantastic time.

‘I’m sure one day we might live together, but that doesn’t man we are not a genuine and very happy couple in the meantime.’
