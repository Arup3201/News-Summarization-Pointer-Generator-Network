Armed police are today patrolling London's Eurostar terminal as security checks at ports and stations were ramped up in the wake of the gun massacre in Paris. 

The development came as the head of MI5 warned that the attack at the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine was a 'terrible reminder of the intentions of those who wish us harm'. 

Home Secretary Theresa May chaired a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee this morning as British police and security agencies closely followed developments in France.

British Transport Police said they have increased armed patrols at London's St Pancras station to provide reassurance to the public at the Eurostar terminal.

A spokesman said: 'Since 2012, we have deployed armed officers within London.

'The safety of rail passengers and staff is of paramount importance to us, and we want to provide a reassuring, visible armed presence to deter terrorism on the rail network.

'In light of the events in Paris, we have increased patrols at St Pancras, in order to maintain and provide enhanced visibility and reassurance to the public. We keep our security arrangements under constant review.' 

Ahead of a speech in London tonight, Andrew Parker, director general of the Security Service, said

'It is too early for us to come to judgments about the precise details or origin of the attack but it is a terrible reminder of the intentions of those who wish us harm.

"As you would expect, we are offering our French colleagues our full support as they respond."

Home Secretary Theresa May arrives in Downing Street to chair a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee. Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'We have to fight this terrorism with everything we have'

Prime Minister David Cameron, speaking at an event in Manchester, said: 'We have to fight this terrorism with everything we have'

Downing Street said there was no specific threat to Britain, but extra measures had been put in place as a precaution. 

The Government has sent a specialist counter terror police officer to Paris to beef up the UK's anti-terror team in France.

David Cameron's official spokesman said: 'What has happened since the incident is, one, the intelligence does not suggest there is any change in the threat level here but on a precautionary basis we have tightened up border security.

'So, I think for example, ports - people going through them will see increased car and truck searches; a bit more scanning of freight.

'They will also see an increased visible presence in the Gare de Nord in Paris.'

Downing Street said checks at ports and Eurostar terminals would be stepped up in the wake of the Paris attacks

Mr Cameron this morning observed a minute silence in respect of the victims of the massacre. 

Speaking this morning, the PM said his thoughts were with the French people following the 'appalling' events in Paris.

He told business leaders at a conference in Manchester: 'Everyone's thoughts will be with the French people and will be thinking about the appalling events that happened yesterday in Paris.

'These are a challenge to our security because we have to fight this terrorism with everything we have.

'But they are also a challenge to our values and ... when it comes to security we must use every part or vigilance and security we have.'

When it comes to values he said the best way to protect them was to 'repeat our belief' in them.

He added: 'We stand with them today in defending the values we all hold dear.'

It comes after Nick Clegg this morning insisted Britain's security services have a grip on the terror threat as he faced questions about why the Cobra emergency committee is not meeting until 24 hours after the Paris attack.

The Deputy Prime Minister stressed that the police, MI5 and MI6 'work flat out all the time regardless of whether a Cobra meeting is taking place in Whitehal.

Home Secretary Theresa May will chair the Cobra meeting this morning with security chiefs, police and senior ministers, after what David Cameron described as a 'different' kind of terror plot.

Masked gunmen killed 12 people, including four cartoonists and two policeman, in the assault on the Paris offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.

A huge manhunt is underway in Paris after police identified two 'armed and dangerous' brothers with links to terrorist groups going back at least a decade. At least seven other people have been arrested.

Mrs May last night said that Britain stands with the French people 'at this time for freedom of speech and democracy and against terror'. She warned that the terror threat to the UK is 'grave and relentless'.

Mr Cameron has offered the assistance of British spies to help French agencies investigate the atrocity.

Taking calls on his weekly phone-in, Mr Clegg faced questions about the British response to the attack in Paris and why Cobra did not meet last night. 

He told LBC: 'Our intelligence services and police work flat out all the time regardless of whether a Cobra meeting is taking place in Whitehall or not.

'They do an extraordinary job and thwart a lot of threats we don't hear about.

'I think it's right that Theresa May is chairing this Cobra meeting this morning to stress test and absolutely check that all the measures that need to be taken in the light of this barbaric murder of journalists in central Paris that every possible eventuality of how that might affect us is properly addressed.'

Mr Clegg stressed that a meeting of Cobra was 'just a forum' at which senior security officials can 'double check' the impact of the Paris attack. 

'It is not as if nothing happens until a meeting happens in Whitehall', he added. 

British tourists in Paris, meanwhile, have been warned to take 'extra care' in the wake of today's terrorist gun attack in the French capital which left 12 people dead.

The Foreign Office warned there is a 'high threat from terrorism' and attacks 'could be indiscriminate'.

The Prime Minister and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were given an extraordinary joint security briefing by British intelligence agencies MI5 and MI6.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg stressed that the police, MI5 and MI6 'work flat out all the time' regardless of whether a Cobra meeting is taking place in Whitehall

The 10-minute briefing was based on what the intelligence agencies had been able to piece together so far from open source material.

It highlighted the calm, determined and apparently professional way the killers had carried out the assault. 

Mr Cameron said: 'This is different from some of the plots that we have seen here in the UK from so-called home-grown terrorists.'

The PM added that the UK was 'already at a very high state of alert' and the security services were looking at what more could be done, he said, 'but there is no one single answer to these appalling terrorist attacks'.

Defending the right to free speech he said: 'We should be very clear this day that these values that we have are not sources of weakness for us, they are sources of strength.

'Of course there are all sorts of economic things we have to get right but, as we do that, the countries that succeed in the future I think will be those that stick to the values of freedom, of democracy, of the rule of law.

'Those are part of the things that make our economies and our societies and our political systems strong and powerful and good and we must not give those up.'

Mr Cameron and Mrs Merkel also spoke to French President Francois Hollande from the Prime Minister's office in No 10, a call the German Chancellor described as a 'very moving moment'.

France has raised its terror alert system to the maximum - Attack Alert - and bolstered security with more than 800 extra soldiers to guard media offices, places of worship and other possible targets. 

French President Francois Hollande chaired an emergency meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris this morning. 

Britain's terror threat level is currently set at 'severe' but the question of increasing to 'critical', the highest state of alert, is likely to be discussed.

It was last raised to critical in 2007 in the wake of terror attacks in London and Glasgow, and indicates an extremely high level of threat.

Three masked attackers brandishing Kalashnikovs burst into the Charlie Hebdo headquarters, opening fire on staff after seeking out journalists by name. 

Those executed included four of the most famous cartoonists in France – men who had regularly satirised Islam and the Prophet Mohammed – including the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Stephane Charbonnier.

Witnesses said the suspect Al Qaeda killers were heard to shout 'the Prophet has been avenged' and 'Allahu akbar!' as they stalked the building.

Horrific footage also emerged showing an injured police officer slumped on the pavement outside the office as two of the gunmen approach. 

Suspects: The three men were named as Cherif Kouachi (left), 32, his brother Said Kouachi (right), 34, and Hamyd Mourad, 18, of Gennevilliers

In a statement the Queen said: 'Prince Philip and I send our sincere condolences to the families of those who have been killed and to those who have been injured in the attack in Paris this moming.

'We send our thoughts and prayers to all those who have been affected.'

The Foreign Office has updated its travel advice to state: 'If you're in Paris or the Ile de France area, take extra care and follow the security advice issued by the French authorities.

'There is a high threat from terrorism. Attacks could be indiscriminate. Due to ongoing threats to France by Islamist groups, and recent French military intervention against ISIL, the French government has warned the public to be especially vigilant and has reinforced its own domestic and overseas security measures.

'Previous incidents attributed to Islamist extremists have included the shooting of 3 soldiers and 4 civilians in Toulouse, and a knife attack on a soldier near Paris.'
