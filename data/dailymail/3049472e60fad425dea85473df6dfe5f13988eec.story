Royal Bank of Scotland has squandered every penny of taxpayers’ rescue cash after racking up £46billion in losses since the financial crisis.

This equates to more than £1,500 for every taxpayer in the UK.

The state-backed lender delivered the grim figures yesterday as it revealed it had slumped further into the red. Some £1.7billion was wiped off its value as shares plunged by almost eight per cent.

The bank posted an £8.2billion loss for last year and sparked another row over pay with plans to award £576million in bonuses. The loss was driven by a spiralling bill for mis-selling and restructuring costs and is the biggest since it posted the worst loss in UK corporate history of £24billion in 2008.

Grim: Royal Bank of Scotland chief Ross McEwan announcing losses of £8.2billion for last year

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Business Secretary Vince Cable led a chorus of criticism over the latest pay bonanza. Mr Clegg said a bank ‘on life support’ should not be ‘dishing out even larger bonuses’.

RBS is 81 per cent owned by taxpayers after receiving a £46billion bail-out in 2008 and 2009. In total, the lender has since paid out £4.6billion in bonuses – £1billion for every £10billion it has lost.

Appearing under a slogan declaring ‘A bank that earns your trust’, RBS chief Ross McEwan acknowledged that ‘it is a highly emotional issue to see bonuses paid when we are still losing money’. But he said he needed to ‘pay competitively’ to attract and retain the best staff.

The argument received short shrift yesterday. Mr Cable said ‘the public simply will not understand why big bonuses and large salaries continue to be paid out by a loss-making public enterprise’.

Predecessor: Stephen Hester was ousted as chief executive with a pay-off worth up to £5.6million after intervention by Chancellor George Osborne

TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady added: ‘There would be no RBS had it not been bailed out by taxpayers. Ordinary people will be wondering how on earth a bank which has made such huge losses for six consecutive years can find a penny in bonuses for its bankers, let alone hundreds of millions.’

Labour also said the Government should reject any request by RBS to pay bumper bonuses for 2014 following the introduction of an EU cap.

The punishing losses mark another setback for plans to sell RBS back to the private sector. Chairman Sir Philip Hampton predicted last May that the Government should be able to start selling shares by the middle of this year.

But Mr McEwan conceded that the bank was not strong enough to ‘be privatised at a profit for the taxpayer in the immediate future’.

The New Zealander replaced Stephen Hester as chief executive last summer. His predecessor was ousted – with a pay-off worth up to £5.6million – after intervention by Chancellor George Osborne.

The Treasury had become increasingly concerned that he was not the right man to lead the bank through privatisation.

Mr McEwan said the ‘days when RBS sought to be the biggest bank in the world are well and truly over’ and instead laid out plans for it to become the ‘best bank in the UK for customers’.

However, he admitted it would take time to win the public’s trust.

‘We are the least trusted company in the least trusted sector of the economy,’ he said. ‘So the goal of my plan is very simple. We have to be a bank that earns your trust.’

Critical: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Business Secretary Vince Cable led a chorus of criticism over the bank's latest pay bonanza

The lender, which also owns NatWest and Ulster Bank, announced a series of measures to win back the public. These include an end to better rates for online customers and ditching ‘sweetener’ payments used to attract new account holders.

But Mr McEwan also became the latest bank boss to warn of plans to shut branches, as more customers bank electronically.

He said the busiest branch is ‘the 7.01 from Reading to Paddington’ as increasing numbers of customers use RBS’s mobile app.

‘We have to accept there will be less branches,’ he said.

RBS also said it aims to trim £5billion from its running costs by 2017. Mr McEwan said this would involve ‘difficult choices on jobs in the years ahead’. More than 41,000 workers have lost their posts since the bank was bailed out.
