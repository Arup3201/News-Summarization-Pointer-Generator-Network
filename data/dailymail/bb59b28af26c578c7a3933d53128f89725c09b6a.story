This is the dramatic moment a three-month-old baby is rescued from heavy flooding that has so far killed at least 40 people in the Balkans.

Members of the Slovenian military winched the baby into a helicopter as floodwater ravaged the northern Bosnian town of Šamac on Saturday.

The rescue was part of a wider mission to deliver food and equipment to people affected by floods in the region.

The Slovenian armed forces helped 52 people to evacuate the severely flooded area during the mission.

Rescued: A three-month-old baby is winched into a helicopter by a member of the Slovenian military as floodwater ravages the Bosnian town of Samac

Bosnia's government says more than one
 million people have been affected by the flooding and landslides after 
days of the heaviest rainfall recorded in the Balkans since records 
began 120 years ago.

The 
video emerged as authorities warned of a new threat of disease from the 
corpses of thousands of tonnes of livestock which drowned in the floods.

With the rainfall stopping and temperatures rising, the withdrawing floodwaters revealed a harrowing sight: thousands of dead cows, pigs, sheep, dogs and other animals that were left behind after their panicked owners fled rapidly advancing torrents.

'There are tons of dead animals that we must dispose of,' Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic told a government meeting Tuesday.

One farm near the northern Bosnian town of Samac reported losing 450 of its 500 cows.

Authorities are also warning that many 
of the more than 100,000 remaining landmines dotted across Bosnia have 
been dislodged by heavy rain, flood waters and hundreds of landslides, 
shifting beyond their markers.

Mine
 removal experts estimate that more than 120,000 landmines remain 
planted across Bosnia, the legacy of a war that killed 100,000 people 
and displaced more than a million.

Bosnia's
 Mine Action Centre (MAC) has appealed for international help in getting
 more equipment and satellite screening to track the movement of mines 
after the heaviest rainfall in the Balkans since records began 120 years
 ago.

The record flooding in Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia in past week has forced half a million people out of their homes and led to at least 40 deaths: 20 in Serbia, 18 in Bosnia and two in Croatia.

Authorities say the death toll still could go higher.

Bosnia declared Tuesday a day of mourning while Serbia said it would hold three days of mourning for flood victims from Wednesday to Friday.

Witnesses say the waters in some areas rose within hours, racing into yards and homes without warning and flooding entire towns.

In many cases, farmers did not have time to unleash their livestock or let them out of barns to try to swim to safety. Only some were pulled out in time.

Authorities in Bosnia have asked for 
international help to deal with the animal carcass problem, while 
governments in both Serbia and Bosnia have set up special phone lines 
for people to reach sanitary teams to pick up dead animals.

Serbian
 state television on Tuesday showed army teams spreading out to 
decontaminate and disinfect flooded areas to prevent possible diseases.

Residents
 also have been given special sanitary instructions: they are not to 
return to their homes before disinfection and not to eat any food from 
flooded gardens, orchards or barns.

'Dead
 animals are a special problem. Those have to be removed and destroyed 
properly or at least dug deep into the ground and covered with calcium 
oxide,' said Bosnia's chief epidemiologist, Dr Zeljko Ler.

Several swollen livestock could be 
seen along the roads leading toward Serbia's hard-hit town of Obrenovac,
 outside the capital of Belgrade. 

The animal carcasses were apparently brought over from fields and barns for veterinary teams to pick up.

In
 Obrenovac itself, dozens of stray dogs and others abandoned by fleeing 
owners were roaming the town's muddy streets, looking for food among the
 scattered debris.

Ler 
warned that acute stomach ailments and other diseases - including 
hepatitis and typhoid - often occur in the aftermath of the flooding.

'We are warning the population to drink only boiled or bottled water,' he said. 'There are still no mass infections (yet) but for some diseases the incubation period is 14 to 21 days.'

In neighboring Croatia, authorities said they managed to save 7,500 livestock from eastern flooded areas and transport them to safety.

The floods are still threatening Serbia's biggest power plant, located in Obrenovac, while in Bosnia, many areas faced new land mine dangers after hundreds of landslides hit, shifting mine fields left over from the country's war.

Water levels in the mighty Danube were also rising Tuesday and Serbian authorities ordered the evacuation of two villages along the banks of Europe's second-largest river.

Both Serbia and Bosnia have appealed for international help, saying damage from the flooding will be measured in billions.

The two countries still have not fully recovered from wars of 1990s, which claimed 100,000 lives and left millions homeless.
