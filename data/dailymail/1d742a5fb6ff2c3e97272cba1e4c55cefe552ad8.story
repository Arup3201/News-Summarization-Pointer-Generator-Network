Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton on Friday forcefully defended his company's decision to cancel the release of The Interview and had some harsh words for President Obama who earlier today said the movie studio 'made a mistake.'

In an exclusive interview Friday with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, Lynton insisted that 'we have not given in and we have not backed down.'

In a controversial move earlier this week, the studio pulled the plug on the release of The Interview after hackers officially linked to North Korea made terrorist threats against theaters showing the comedy.

Speaking out: Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton on Friday forcefully defended his company's decision to cancel the release of The Interview

Lynton told CNN Sony does not have the interface necessary to distribute the movie on the web directly

Harsh words: On Friday, President Obama said during a press conference Sony 'made a mistake' when it decided to cancel the release of the political satire 

'The president, the press, and the public are mistaken as to what actually happened,' Lynton said. 'We do not own movie theaters. We cannot determine whether or not a movie will be played in movie theaters.'

After Wednesday's threats, Sony told theaters they could drop the film if they chose to, and all major chains promptly did.

The company then scrapped the release altogether.

Responding to calls from the likes of George Clooney to release the movie online, Lynton told CNN Sony does not have the interface necessary to distribute the movie on the web directly.

Lynton explained that in order to release the film online, they need to go through a third-party distributor, but so far none have come forward offering their services.

Earlier on Friday, Obama said during his end-of-the-year press conference Sony should have released the film and not bowed to pressure from hackers.

'I wish they would have spoken to me first,' Obama said. 'I would have told them, "Do not get into a pattern in which you're intimidated by these kinds of criminal attacks."

'We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States,' the president said. 'Because if somebody is able to intimidate folks out of releasing a satirical movie, imagine what they start doing when they see a documentary that they don't like, or news reports that they don't like.'

The hackers leaked embarrassing emails between Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin joking in a racially insensitive manner about Obama's film tastes.

The Sony executive said if given the chance, the studio would have made The Interview again, and that he still would like the public to see the film

Responding to the president's critique, Lynton said Sony had 'no alternative' but to pull the screwball comedy about a fictional plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un because movie theater chains said they would not screen the film.

'We have not caved, we have not given in, we have persevered and we have not backed down,' Lynton said. 'We have always had every desire to have the American public see this movie.'

The Sony executive added that if given the chance, the studio would have made The Interview all over again, and that he still would like the public to see the film.

'Knowing what I know now, we might have... done something slightly differently,' he added.

When asked about his reaction to the president's statement earlier today, Lynton - a long-time support of Obama - said he would be 'fibbing' had he said he wasn't disappointed.

'I don't know exactly whether he understands the sequence of events that led up to the movie not being shown in the movie theaters,' Lynton said. 'Therefore I would disagree with the notion that it was a mistake.'

The full interview with Michael Lynton will air Friday night on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 at 8pm and Sunday on Fareed Zakaria GPS.
