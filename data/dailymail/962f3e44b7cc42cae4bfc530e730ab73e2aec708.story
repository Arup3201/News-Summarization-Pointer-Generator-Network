A three-year-old girl was found dangling by her neck from a fourth floor window grill after her parents left her alone to go to work in China.

Firefighters were called when passerby heard Chyou Wang's cries after she became stuck by her head in the grill, which is designed to stop burglars.

The tearful girl was eventually freed by emergency services in the city of Guilin in Guangxi Zhuang after they broke into the flat.

Firefighters had to widen the bars while holding on to the girl before easing her free.

Her parents said she must have got bored or gone to look for them and somehow managed to open the window by herself.

When she got outside, it is believed she slipped and was only prevented from falling four storeys to the ground by her head.

Pictures show the distressed child holding onto the bars with her knees up while firefighters worked. 

They said they often left her alone while they went to work and she usually just slept or watched television.

The girl's parents have promised not to leave her alone again after her traumatic experience

Her parents said they shut and locked the door before leaving.

Father Lian, 44, said: 'We never imagined something like this could have happened.

'We are so grateful that it worked out well in the end.'

In the meantime her parents had also been located and came back to console their daughter and now promise not to leave her on her own in future.
