Half of women and 43 per cent of men are taking a drug prescribed by their doctor, it was revealed yesterday.

A study into the nation’s pill-popping habits, the first of its type, found the most prescribed medicines were cholesterol-lowering statins, followed closely by drugs to reduce blood pressure and aspirin.

Twice as many women – one in nine – as men use antidepressants.

A study into the nation’s pill-popping habits, the first of its type, found the most prescribed medicines were cholesterol-lowering statins, followed closely by drugs to reduce blood pressure and aspirin 

In all, the report showed an average of 18.7 prescriptions per person in England in 2013, costing the NHS in excess of £15billion a year.

According to the latest Health Survey for England by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, the number of prescription drugs increases with age. More than half those aged 65 and over are taking at least three medicines and more than a third aged 75 plus take at least six medicines.

Dr Jennifer Mindell, reader in public health at University College London and one of the report’s authors, said the figures should be taken in context as people were living longer and in better health than ever, which may be partly due to drugs used both for prevention and treatment of disease. GPs said ‘strict and robust monitoring systems’ ensured patients only got drugs when absolutely necessary.

The report is the first nationally representative assessment of drugs actually being taken by people in the community, rather than within the healthcare system. As well as those on long term medication, it includes those who were on a short course of antibiotics but represents a daily picture of the use of drugs.

Overall, 50 per cent of women had taken at least one drug during the previous week compared with 43 per cent of men. More than a fifth of men and nearly a quarter of women were taking at least three. Most frequently used drugs were statins to cut cholesterol – taken by 16 per cent of men and 12 per cent of women – and medication to reduce high blood pressure (14 per cent of men and 15 per cent of women).

Painkillers were taken by 12 per cent of women, just ahead of antidepressants (11 per cent). Middle-aged women were most likely to need antidepressants – 16 per cent of 45-64 year old women are on them – along with 17 per cent of the poorest women compared with 7 per cent of the richest.

Cholesterol lowering statins, pain relief and anti-depressants among the most commonly prescribed drugs

The most commonly prescribed single medicine was simvastatin (40million prescriptions) for high cholesterol followed by aspirin (31million).

Dr Mindell admitted it was hard to tell from the figures whether growing use of drugs meant hypochondriacs were also on the increase. She said there had been big changes in statin use, for example, with millions more eligible to take them today than a decade ago. Depression rates were generally higher among women than men because they were more willing to seek medical help. Dr Maureen Baker, of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said: ‘Prescribing is a core skill for GPs and patients can be assured that their family doctor will prescribe medication only when necessary and where other alternatives have been explored. GPs also have to adhere to strict and robust monitoring systems.

‘We have an ageing population and more patients are presenting with complex and multiple conditions including mental health issues and this is reflected in today’s figures.’
