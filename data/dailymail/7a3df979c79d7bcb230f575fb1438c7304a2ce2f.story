Nervous: Megan Harvey, 14, has to avoid excitement as it drives her into a fit of vomiting that can last 12 hours

A 14-year-old girl has a rare condition that makes her vomit for hours on end if she gets excited.

Megan Harvey has been forced to miss sleepovers, days out and parties for fear of a sickness attack - which can last around 12 hours.

And the anticipation ahead of her school prom left her hospitalised for a week.

It means that family holidays are a 
nightmare - as Megan's condition is triggered by the emotions of 
anticipation leading up to an event.

The condition, Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome (CVS), emerged as she reached secondary school, when she would be struck be severe vomiting attacks towards the end of every term.

Her mother, Jodie Harvey, said: 'We didn't understand why she got so ill in the summer holidays until she was diagnosed with CVS.

'Then we realised it was her excitement about going out and having fun which was making her so sick.

'She goes into a kind of waking coma when she's sick and when she's recovered she can't remember what has happened.

'One year we travelled to Spain by coach for our family holiday - Megan was sick for the entire 12-hours of the journey - it was awful.

'Now I don't let Megan go for parties or sleepovers before we go away - we try and keep her as quiet as possible to prevent the holiday being ruined.

'It can be really upsetting - as a surprise I once booked tickets to go roller skating at the O2 before Christmas.

Hospitalised: The condition left her hospitalised for a week due to the anticipation of her school prom

'After telling her she got so exited that the evening before we were due to go she got sick and we didn't end up going.'

Megan, from Belvedere in Kent, even missed her end of school prom due to her severe CVS.

She and her mother went shopping for the dress and shoes, arranged the hairdressers and were ready for the big night when a sickness attack hit leaving Megan incredibly ill and unable to celebrate with her friends.

Family events to the science museum, a 
birthday pamper party and a trip to the races have also been ruined by 
Megan's rare condition.

Treatment: The schoolgirl must now take a cocktail of drugs to quell her condition, Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome

Mrs Harvey said: 'This summer Megan stayed at a friends house and camped in the garden. There were around 15 girls and again Megan got sick.

'Because she was comatose and vomiting her friends all thought she had got drunk and teased her.

'Megan was taken home where she spent five days being sick and recovering from the excitement of the occasion.'
