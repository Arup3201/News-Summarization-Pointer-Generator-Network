Traitor: But MI6 bosses believed that Kim Philby could not possibly have betrayed his country

British spy bosses repeatedly tried to protect Soviet double agent Kim Philby because they believed he 'couldn't possibly be a traitor', according to a new book which was banned by MI6.

Tim Milne, an MI6 spy who was Philby's oldest friend, has revealed the extraordinary lengths to which intelligence officials went in order to protect the notorious figure.

Philby came under suspicion when two other members of the Cambridge spy ring fled to Moscow - but despite a 12-year investigation, he was never brought to justice and was eventually allowed to defect to the USSR himself.

MI6 chiefs refused to believe that he could be guilty because of his apparently distinguished service and Establishment background, and shielded him from an MI5 probe.

Milne was a childhood friend of Philby's after the pair attended Westminster School together, and they travelled across Europe as students in the early 1930s.

When Philby joined MI6, he recruited Milne to be his deputy, giving the author a unique insight into the investigation which eventually unveiled his old friend as a foreign agent.

In 1951, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean - old friends with Philby from their Cambridge days - fled to Moscow after being unmasked as Soviet spies.

It was obvious that someone had tipped the two men off to allow them to escape, and Philby was eventually forced to resign his position as the senior British spy liaising with U.S. officials.

However, Milne's book - titled Kim Philby: The Unknown Story of the KGB's Master-Spy - reveals that MI6 bosses did not believe that he was actually guilty of Soviet spying, according to the Guardian.

'There were very few people in the service who had inspired so much trust and respect as Kim, and so much affection among those who had worked closely with him,' the author writes.

'The general office belief was that he'd had to go simply to preserve good relations with the Americans.'

Sir Stewart Menzies, head of MI6 during the war, even told the director of MI5 that Philby - who had previously been in charge of detecting double agents - 'couldn't possibly be a traitor'.

Revelations: The inside story of the hunt for Philby is told in a new book by Tim Milne

Despite losing his post at MI6, 
Philby was employed as a journalist in Beirut with the help of security 
officials, and maintained links with the serivce.

The
 next year, bosses decided to send an agent to Beirut to interrogate 
him, but MI6 insisted on sending one of Philby's ex-colleagues, Nicholas
 Elliott, rather than a famously tough MI5 agent.

Milne
 reveals in his book that Elliott - who believed Philby when he said he 
had stopped spying for the KGB 16 years earlier - made several blunders 
in the questioning which allowed the double agent to walk free yet 
again.

Elliott's recording of the interrogation was inaudible because of the noise of traffic outside, and he allowed Philby not to sign a statement in which he admitted his guilt, instead saying he would return for another meeting later.

Before that meeting took place, Philby vanished in January 1963 and settled in Moscow, where he lived for 25 years before his death.

MI6 officials continued to insist that he had given them valuable information about other agents, according to Milne, even telling Harold Macmillan that he had helped detect Soviet spies in Britain.

The security services tried to block the appearance of Milne's book, but after he died in 2010 his family continued the fight against censorship, and this week it will be published by Biteback Publishing.

The 'Cambridge Five' spying scandal rocked the Establishment by revealing Soviet double agents at the heart of many of Britain's most storied institutions.

Kim Philby, Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean and Anthony Blunt all met at the University of Cambridge, where Blunt was an academic and the other three were undergraduates.

The older man recruited the students to the Soviet cause before the Second World War - and they remained devoted to the USSR even after the start of the Cold War.

Philby was head of counter-intelligence for MI6, while Maclean was a Foreign Office official and Burgess worked for the BBC.

Blunt was the most eminent of all, as director of the Courtauld Institute and keeper of the royal family's art collection.

In 1951, Burgess and Maclean were exposed as double agents - but after being tipped off by Philby they were able to escape to Moscow.

Despite the suspicion surrounding Philby, he avoided detection until 1963, when he too defected to the USSR.

Blunt escaped exposure for even longer - it was not until 1979, when Margaret Thatcher named him as a suspect in the House of Commons, that he confessed to his treachery and was stripped of his titles.

The 'fifth man' in the spy ring has never been definitively identified, but was named as John Cairncross by KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky.

The story of the unlikely traitors has been dramatised several times, including in John le Carr√©'s classic book Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and a 2003 BBC series titled Cambridge Spies.
