Judge Guy Kearl QC fined student juror Thomas Kelcher £250 after he was late turning up at court

A juror who overslept when his alarm clock failed to go off because of a power failure has been fined £250.

Architecture student Thomas Kelcher's lateness earned him a severe ticking off from Judge Guy Kearl, QC, who told him he had cost the taxpayer more than £12,000.

The university student was due at Leeds Crown Court at 10.30am yesterday where the jury was hearing the case of a man accused of sex offences, but did not appear until after 1pm.

He told the judge there had been a power cut at his parents' home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, and his alarm clock had turned off.

He said: 'I know it’s not a good excuse.'

Judge Kearl asked him what time he went to bed on Monday night and was told midnight.

'So you slept 12-and-a-half hours non-stop?' asked the judge.

'Yes,' replied Kelcher.

His fellow jurors were waiting to resume considering verdicts in the trial of a Huddersfield man accused of sex offences.

Kelcher arrived after 1pm when the jury retired and reached verdicts in the trial, but was kept in court to be dealt with after the rest of the jury left.

The judge said that Kelcher had already been warned about being late one day last week.

He said: 'This is now the second occasion you have been extremely late.

'That is not only a question of disrespect for the court but for everybody involved in the case, not least the defendant awaiting the outcome of his case no doubt anxiously, but also to your fellow members of the jury.'

The judge said out of concern for the juror’s welfare he had also asked the police to visit to check on him. By the time they did he had already left for court, but he said that was more public money wasted.

Thomas Kelcher turned up at Leeds Crown Court more than two hours late after his alarm clock failed to go off

The juror, who said he was studying at Northumbria University and had a part time job as a sales assistant in Newcastle, said he did not have much money.

He was ordered to pay the fine at £10 a week or face 14 days in prison in default.
