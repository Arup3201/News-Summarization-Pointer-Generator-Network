Cushty: Oscar Pistorius has been given a raft of new privileges in prison after having his status was upgraded from category B to category A

Oscar Pistorius is now able to hug and kiss his visitors, own a radio and wear jewellery in a raft of new privileges behind bars, MailOnline has learned.

The convicted killer will also be free to make more phone calls, take up a hobby and have a bigger budget to buy toiletries and treats after a decision by jail chiefs to re-categorise his prisoner status.

News that Pistorius has been upgraded to category A status from category B comes two years after he shot dead Reeva Steenkamp at his home on Valentine's Day.

Although Pistorius is still said to be struggling to cope with his loss of freedom, bosses at Kgosi Mampuru prison in the South African capital, Pretoria, relaxed the terms of his incarceration after deciding he poses little threat to security. 

The Pistorius family spokeswoman, Annalise Burgess, confirmed the track star, known as the Blade Runner, is 'now a Category A prisoner' – news that was greeted with delight by his relatives.

A family source told MailOnline: 'We have a family Whatsapp group on which we all hear the news about Oscar as well as other family business.

'Since Aimee and Carl (his sister and brother) are his most frequent visitors, it is usually them who let the rest of us know what is happening with him inside. 

'This has boosted him a lot. He has been very low in prison, although he seems to be getting all the support from the prison authorities that he needs. 

'His new status means he will be able to have more visits – there are a lot of family members who would like to go and see him, but in the past have stayed away so that it is mostly Carl, Aimee, his aunt and grandmother who take the allocated slots.'

It comes after one prison officer last week said the disgraced former Paralympian was being treated 'like royalty'. 

Up until now, Pistorius has been separated from his visitors by glass, with a handset to speak through and and a strictly 'no-touching' policy in place. 

The 28-year-old can now touch his loved ones during their 'contact' visits, which have been extended from two to three hours per month, although both he and his visitors will still be searched.

Pistorius must continue wear his prison-issue orange jump suit.   

Sentence: Oscar slips his watch to his uncle Arnold as he is taken down to the holding cells after being given five years imprisonment for the culpable homicide. He has now been allowed to wear jewellery in prison

The runner who is famously a keen collector of expensive watches, is also now also free to wear jewellery, though not in his ears or nose. 

He was seen to hand over a chunky designer watch to his uncle Arnold Pistorius as he was led to the cells in the minutes after he was jailed for culpable homicide - or manslaughter - in October.

The allowance the famous inmate is allowed to spend at the prison tuck shop has also risen– from R100 to R150 (£6 to £9) – which will enable him to buy chocolate, fizzy drinks and toiletries.  

Thanks to his new status, Pistorius will now have more chance of entertaining himself in his single cell, with the right to pursue a hobby (provided no sharp tools are needed) and keep a radio.

The star of the London Olympic games will also be free to make more phone calls - 24 per year, a massive hike on his category B allowance of six per year. 

All prisoners are allowed to receive and write as many letters as they like, although they must fund their own postage and stationary costs.   

Killed by her boyfriend: Oscar was convicted of Reeva Steenkamp's manslaughter after shooting her through a locked toilet door at his home in Pretoria in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013

Since his jailing nearly four months ago, the shamed sprinter has completed a number of rehabilitation programmes, including a course on coping with emotions, and has proved to be a model prisoner.

According to a prison guard, Pistorius spends much of his day isolated from other inmates. 

The sprawling facility is notorious for the sexual and physical violence that is meted out by the 'numbers' gangs who dominate prison life. 

Attacking – even murdering - fellow inmates is a means of climbing the gangs' chains of command, and a famous target is likely to hold even greater kudos.  

As a precaution, Pistorius rarely leaves his hospital wing where, at weekends, early mornings and late afternoons he is in the company of one of South Africa's most infamous underworld criminals, Radovan Krejcir.  

Although Pistorius is still said to be struggling to cope with his loss of freedom, bosses at Kgosi Mampuru prison (above) have relaxed the terms of his incarceration after deciding he poses little threat to security

The Czech fugitive – who is wanted in his own country on a raft of charges – is the defendant in three active court cases in South Africa, including fraud, robbery and torture.

Last week, he was charged with a fresh count of murder.

The Olympian and the fugitive shares the use of Krejcir's running machine and exercise bike which are kept on the hospital wing corridor.

As a prisoner on trial, the Czech is entitled to greater privileges than a convicted criminal such as Pistorius.  

Pistorius could be freed from prison as early as July and allowed to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. 

However, prosecutors are appealing his conviction for culpable homicide as well as his five-year jail term. 

Pistorius is expected to fight any decision to convict him of murder or lengthen his prison sentence, despite the fact he ran out of money to pay the team who defended him at his lengthy murder trial.

Pistorius made history at London 2012 by competing at the Olympics and the Paralympics, where he won two gold medals.
