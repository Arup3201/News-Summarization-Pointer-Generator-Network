With delicate central carvings that appear to be growing from the solid wood on either side, the Branching Table isn't your average sitting room centrepiece.

Crafted from walnut wood and plexiglass, the piece is the brainchild of San Francisco architect and designer Andrei Hakhovich who says his unusual design was inspired by growing things as well as the relationships between people.

'While I was developing the Branching Table, I kept thinking about about the relationships between people as they sit across [the table] from each other,' explained the Belarus-born designer.

Creative: The hidden plexiglass support makes the table appear as if it is growing branches

Delicate: The fragile branch details are toughened up with protective plexiglass

'Tension, attraction, repulsion, connection - I wanted to reveal it all. I had a desire to map the unseen, although part of the table's geometry was inspired by growing forces in trees and traditional Japanese joinery.'

While the table can be used like a normal coffee table - you can pile books and the remote control on it - Hakhovich hopes that those who buy one will treat it as more than just a piece of furniture.

Project: Along with the Branching Table, Hakhovich has also made a table lamp from old cassette tapes

'I consider it to be more like a 
functional inspiring art piece,' he explains. 'I hope people will be 
moved by it and encouraged to connect and spend more time together while
embracing the unique craftsmanship and enjoying the ownership of a 
piece that will last a lifetime.'

Striking
though it is, the Branching Table isn't the only foray into furniture 
design that Hakhovich, and his design consultancy Gradient Matter, have 
made.

The Belorussian is also behind the Tapelamp, a limited-edition light fitting made using recycled cassette tapes.

Other works include an 'Infiniti Tree' made from frosted acrylic and created to dress a Cirque du Soleil set.

He has also designed the 'Airium', a light, ultra-modern building that Hakhovich hopes will one day be built in San Francisco.

Despite his big plans, Hakhovich says smaller works such as the Branching Table dovetail neatly with his more grandiose efforts.

'I use small-scale work like furniture and installations as a research and testing grounds for some ideas that later will be translated or incorporated into large scale work,' he explains. 'I find working across multiple scales very satisfying.'

But not quite as satisfying, perhaps, as those who manage to get their hands on the incredible Branching Table.
