When a Michigan family was looking for answers to help their sick daughter in 2010, the last place they expected sound medical advice was from a man who would one day be running for president.

But Brad and Jesi Smith found answers from then-Senator Rick Santorum to help their then 22-month-old daughter Faith.

The smiling brunette girl suffers from the same genetic disorder – Trisomy 18 – as Mr Santorum’s youngest daughter Bella.

Interested party: Santorum told Mr Smith several months later that without treatment for sleep apnea, their daughter Faith wouldn't survive

Helping hands: Brad and Jesi Smith said they owe their daughter's life to Rick Santorum, who told them to have her see a sleep specialist

The Rochester Hills, Michigan family told the Detroit Free Press about their incredible encounter with Mr Santorum two years ago, and the advice the family claims saved their daughter’s life.

When Faith was born, doctors said the outlook was bleak. She was diagnosed with Trisomy 18, a genetic disorder that causes heart defects, kidney problems, delayed growth, and a small head.

Mrs Smith, a radio station sales manager, told the paper that one doctor told her to put away funds for the funeral, as most children die either in infancy or as a toddler.

‘I said, absolutely not, I’m saving for her wedding,’ she told the Detroit Free Press.

After switching hospitals to the University of Michigan’s C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital, prognosis looked better, as doctors were eager to learn from the case.

In the spring of 2010, the Smiths were looking forward to meeting with Mr Santorum, as he was the only person they knew with a child who suffered from the same disease.

Born this way: Faith was born with Trisomy 18, also called Edwards syndrome, which is a genetic disorder where a person is born with extra chromosome 18 material from a third copy which interferes with normal development

Have some faith: Faith's condition greatly improved after she was diagnosed with sleep apnea, which allowed doctors to better treat her

They spoke with him about their daughter Faith, and he showed them an article he had written on his BlackBerry about his own daughter Bella. His wife Karen talked to them throughout his speech that evening, the Detroit Free Press said.

But seven months later, Faith’s health was declining. By chance, Mr Santorum was in town for an unrelated fundraiser and came into Mr Smith’s radio station to tape a show.

Mr Smith approached Mr Santorum, asking his advice for his sick daughter. According to Mr Smith, the senator said they needed to get Faith tested for sleep apnea – where someone stops breathing in their sleep – and get her a breathing machine.

He said that sleep apnea was particularly precarious for Trisomy 18 children.

Mr Smith expressed his doubts, and said Mr Santorum then got stern, saying: ‘Look, you need to do this. If you don’t , you’re going to lose your daughter.’

Loving father: Rick Santorum held his daughter Bella on June 6, 2011 to announce he was running in the 2012 presidential race

Father and daughter: Trisomy 18 is a genetic disorder in which a person has a third copy of material from chromosome 18, instead of the usual two copies

Per the politician’s advice, the Smiths took Faith to see a sleep specialist, who diagnosed her with sleep apnea and said she was swinging her arms at night to keep herself awake so she wouldn’t stop breathing.

Trisomy 18, also called Edwards syndrome, is a genetic disorder where a person is born with extra chromosome 18 material from a third copy which interferes with normal development.

Described as a relatively common condition, it occurs in about one out of 3,000 live births, killing half of those within their first week.

Those who have survived into their teenage years suffer from serious medical and developmental problems including clenched hands, mental deficiency, a small head or jaw and heart defects.

A small number of adults with the condition make it to their twenties or thirties while always requiring assisted caregiving.

The happy father credited Mr Santorum with the initial breakthrough. ‘I can honestly say that if not for Rick Santorum, (Faith) would not be alive today.’

Mr Santorum himself has gone through several scares with his own daughter Bella in recent months. In January, she was admitted to the hospital for pneumonia.

When asked about her, Mr Santorum says his daughter was not expected to survive until her first birthday and often has to catch himself to stop from tears.

'I have a little girl who's three-and-a-half years old,' he told Christian conservatives in Iowa before winning the caucus there.

'I don't know whether her life is going to be measured - it's always been measured - in days and weeks. Yet here I am... because I feel like I wouldn't be a good dad if I wasn't out here fighting for a country that would see the dignity in her and every other child.'

When voters ask him about her, he calls the decision to campaign 'gut-retching' but says he hopes to fight for all special needs families.

'You think she's fine, and then one cold and she's this close to dying,' he told the Washington Post in an interview last year.

In October, he missed one of Bella's surgeries to participate in a debate and told the audience that he planned to take an all-night flight home from Las Vegas to be with her.

'I look at the simplicity and love she emits,' Mr Santorum said in a web video his campaign released after his scheduling drew questions, 'and it's clear to me we're the disabled ones.'
