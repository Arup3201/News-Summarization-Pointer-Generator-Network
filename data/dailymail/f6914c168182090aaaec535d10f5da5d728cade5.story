The 3-year-old boy found dead after his parents mistakenly left him in a hot car in Florida over the weekend died of hypothermia, an autopsy has revealed.

Kyrese Anderson was pronounced dead on Saturday afternoon after being mistakenly left inside a hot SUV for up to four hours as his parents attended the funeral.

'It's very, very tragic and everything 
the detectives have uncovered so far point to it being a very tragic 
accident,' Dave Bristow of the Manatee County Sheriff's Office.

Tragedy: This is the Florida home where Kyrese Anderson, 3, died after his parents accidentally left him in a hot car for four hours while they went to the funeral of another family member

The confusion started when the baby's 
parents, Robert Anderson, 29, and Amanda Jo Anderson, 30, took two cars 
to drop their children off with a babysitter about 1 p.m.

The two older children - ages 4 and 5 - were in one of the vehicles, while Kyrese was in the other.

The
Andersons dropped the two older kids off with the babysitter but forgot
about Kyrese. They then took one car to the funeral and left the other -
the one containing the boy - in front of the babysitter's house, as the
hot, mid-day sun beat down upon it.

'They
get back from the funeral several hours later - and they ask where the 
3-year-old was, and the babysitter said, "I thought he was with you?'" Bristow told NBC2.

Heat related vehicle deaths amongst children are relatively rare and tend to happen in places with warmer climates like the southwest and Florida

The couple rushed to the car and 
found the baby unresponsive inside at about 4 p.m. and called 911. 
Kyrese was pronounced dead at a local hospital.

The Manatee County Sheriff's Office is
investigating the case. So far, no charges have been filed against the 
parents or babysitter.

After the autopsy was completed, experts said the official cause of death was hyperthermia.

Heat
related vehicle deaths amongst children are relatively rare and tend 
to happen, as one would imagine, more frequently in places with warmer 
climates, like the southwest and Florida.

According
to the website KidsandCars.org, 33 children were killed in the U.S. 
when they were left in hot cars in 2011. That's down from 49 in 2010.

The table shows non-traffic fatalities amongst children and shows that there were 613 heat-related deaths between 1991 and 2011

The group suggests parents take precautions to keep them from forgetting about children sitting in rear car seats. For example, leaving a purse or cell phone in the backseat is a good way to ensure that you will look in the back of the vehicle before getting out of it.

The group also suggests putting a large stuffed animal in the seat when the baby is not in the vehicle. When the baby is in the vehicle, the group suggests you put the stuffed animal in the front seat as a reminder that a baby is in the back.

Additionally, the group suggests parents get in the habit of always opening a rear door when they reach a destination - the group calls this ' look before you lock.'
