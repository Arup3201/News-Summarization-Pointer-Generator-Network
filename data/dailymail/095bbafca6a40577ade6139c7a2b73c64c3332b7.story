Followers of Haiti's most celebrated patron saint have made their annual pilgrimage to a remote waterfall in a bid to cleanse themselves of their bad luck and sins.

Voodoo worshippers travelled to Saut d'Eau, 42 miles north of the capital Port-au-Prince, to wash in the water which is believed to have purifying powers.

As part of the cleansing ritual, they delivered a list of wishes to improve to their lives and used leaves to wash away negative omens.  

Lionel Saint-Jean, who attended the gathering, said that after losing his house in Haiti's catastrophic 2010 quake, he asked the saint for a new one and he got one. 'So I came this year to thank her for that,' he said. 

Haitians have travelled to the same spot for hundreds of years to bathe because the virgin saint is believed to have appeared on a palm tree there in 1847.

 Voodoo, or Vodou as many practitioners prefer, evolved from West African beliefs and adopted elements of Roman Catholicism.

To a higher power: A woman holds up an empty bowl to the waterfall before praying at the Saut d'Eau waterfall in Haiti. As part of the ritual, they also petition the saint, Our Lady Mount Carmel, by shouting out a wish list at the base of the cascading water

Euphoria: A woman holds out her hand and sings  while a number of other Haitian worshippers bathe in the mystical water behind

Immersed: A voodoo pilgrim stands in the middle of the waterfall which is believed to have purifying powers

Bathing: A Voodoo pilgrim scrubs himself with tree leaves which he believes will give him good luck, as he readies to cleanse himself with the other followers

Crowd: Thousands of Haitians travel to the spot every year in a bid to wash away their negative omens 

Cleanse: Two voodoo believers submerge themselves in the water, hoping it will cleanse them of their sins and bad luck

Surrounded: A voodoo pilgrim bathes using leaves mixed inside a bowl at the waterfall 

Crowd: A number of men and women walk to the base of the waterfall with bowls in a bid to collect a sample of the water

Procession: The ritual involves percussion-led music and dancing. Most participants strip down to their underwear as part of the annual tradition

Crowd: A number of men walk up the waterfall with containers to take a sample of the water away
