We reveal how to get the enviable physiques of the stars. 

This week: Rene Russo's legs.

Rene Russo's slender legs stole the show when she turned up with director husband Dan Gilroy at an awards ceremony in New York recently. 

The 60-year-old actress says: 'I work out every day, but just 20 minutes on that damn bike, do some light weights, and that's it and I've gotta move on.'

She focuses on 'one body part a day' and walks a lot. To stay flexible, she does Feldenkrais floor work, a type of stretching, and Pilates moves.

What to try: 

Knee crossover tucks. Lie face down as if doing press-ups. Raise yourself up using your arms, maintaining a stable, straight torso.

Slowly lift one foot off the floor and raise the leg, bringing the knee across and into your chest. 

Stop when you feel your lower back bending and slowly lower to the starting position. 

Repeat for the other side. Do it 12-15 times on each side.
