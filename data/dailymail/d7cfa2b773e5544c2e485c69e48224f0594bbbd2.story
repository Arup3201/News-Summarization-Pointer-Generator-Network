Heaven knows what James Sherwood would make of this.

The American tycoon occupied Sea Containers House for many years. It was the HQ for his shipping company, and then his Orient Express trains and hotels.

On the top floor, he made sure there was the biggest boardroom in London, if not the world. It stretched the entire length of the building.

Great location, shame about the general service: The Inspector found the Mondrian to be rather overpriced

Now it's the Mondrian London hotel - and while this American outfit has maintained something of a nautical theme (there's a submarine hanging over the restaurant bar and various models of container ships are dotted about), the vibe is super-cool, courtesy of designer Tom Dixon.

It's the sort of place where you wear dark glasses when it's raining.

And where you don't flinch when bumping into Russell Brand coming out of the loo, or when being charged £10 for an ordinary glass of vino.

It's day two when we're there, but please don't give me all that guff about teething trouble.

Not at these prices.

Our shoebox costs £221 room only, for which we get some plastic art on the wall that looks like cows' udders. The bed is at an angle, presumably in an attempt to make the room more interesting.

No bath. No heated towel rail. One small bottle of water. Sealed windows. And it's not as if many of the rooms actually look out over the Thames.

Mind you, the views of St Paul's Cathedral from the main bar are splendid. We order a couple of drinks, but it takes the barman ages to produce them. The music is too loud, but it doesn't matter because most people are taking photographs of each other rather than conversing.

We love our table in the restaurant. We are near a window, and can watch joggers, skateboarders and cyclists flashing past. Trouble is, the menu is complicated, with far too many categories: small plates; raw; flatbreads; market salads; larger dishes and 'dishes for the table, served family style'.

'What does that mean?' we ask.

'We normally recommend two people to share,' says our waiter.

The ribeye comes in at £71 - I would want to feed the whole family for that.

With no desserts and two glasses of wine each, our bill for dinner is £121. Oh, and if you order a newspaper, it'll cost you £3. Climbing into bed I feel something plastic rubbing against me.

Could be worse - it's a glove left by whoever made up the bed.

Sorry to bang on about money, but go for the Sea Containers Breakfast Table and it costs £19. My wife has a yogurt and two slices of pineapple.

'Will that cost £19?' I ask.

'Yes, but she can go back for more.' 'But she doesn't want to.'

We ask to see the manager, who, to his credit, accepts the pricing is bizarre and charges us nothing.

I produce the plastic glove at checkout and secretly hope the smiley young man will knock something off our bill. He doesn't.

We won't return.
