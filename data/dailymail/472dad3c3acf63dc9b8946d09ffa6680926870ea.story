A 'polo-playing friend of Prince Charles' could be jailed for failing to hand over Mercedes cars, a Harley Davidson motorbike and a personalised number plate to his ex-wife.

Libor Krejci, 63, a former tennis coach turned property developer, led an 'international lifestyle', including yachting and playing polo with royalty, off the back of an off-shore family trust worth at least £30m, according to his ex-wife, Gillian Hope Lewis.

But he claimed he was broke, having declared himself bankrupt in the UK when he and his wife split in 2000. 

Battle: Libor Krejci (left), was described as a 'polo playing friend of Prince Charles' worth £30m, is facing a bid to have him jailed by his ex-wife Gillian Hope Lewis (right), for not handing over Mercedes CL500 and SL350 cars and a Harley Davidson as well as a personalised number plate as part of his divorce settlement

However, his plea of poverty was rejected by divorce judge, Mr Justice Mostyn, who ordered him to pay his ex £368,000 including costs.

In June last year, the judge also ruled that Mrs Hope Lewis could enforce her order against two riverside flats in Battersea - valued by lawyers at £1m - along with two Mercedes cars and a Harley Davidson, as they represented the only accessible assets linked to her husband in the UK.

The properties and the vehicles were the property of Mr Krejci’s off-shore family trust, but the judge allowed the wife to 'pierce the corporate veil' and take possession in order to satisfy the divorce award.

Now Mrs Hope Lewis has applied to the High Court to have Mr Krejci committed to prison, for his alleged failure to deliver up the Mercedes CL500 and SL350 cars and the motorbike, along with personalised number plate LBO1.

Mr Krejci has already had an appeal against the lump sum order thrown out by Lord Justice Thorpe, in the Court of Appeal - where he was described by the judge as 'generally angry about everything.'

The businessman, of Lombard Road, Battersea, and Mrs Hope Lewis, separated in 2000, after a 17-year marriage, leaving her as the primary carer for their teenage daughter.

In 2011, Mr Justice Mostyn called Mr Krejci’s conduct of the case 'truly abysmal'.

He also found that 'bankruptcy in the UK didn’t involve much hardship for the husband.'

'His business was successful and was owned by the (off-shore) trust,' said the judge, who added: 'He had access to large amounts of cash from his inheritance in the Czech Republic.' 

'Friend of Prince Charles': Mrs Hope Lewis' then barrister, Duncan Brooks, told the Appeal Court last year 'he is the polo-playing friend of Prince Charles and the beneficiary of an off-shore trust with assets exceeding £30m'

He put Mr Krejci’s identifiable assets at £1m, although his wife claims he has access to far more.

Mrs Hope Lewis, formerly of Bole Walk, Cardiff, but currently believed to be living in Battersea, is now asking the High Court Family Division to commit her ex-husband to prison for alleged contempt of court in failing to hand over the cars and motorbike awarded to her by the judge.

In a preliminary hearing, her barrister, Amy Kisser, told the court that '19 attempts' had so far been made to serve court documents on Mr Krejci, without success, and asked Mrs Justice Parker to deem that he had been officially informed of the proceedings via email last month.

Timothy Becker, for Mr Krejci, did not object, and the judge ruled that good service had been achieved and ordered Mr Krejci to pay legal costs.

However Mr Becker went on to tell the court that Mr Krejci argues it is not his responsibility to hand over the vehicles and number plate.

The most valuable of the cars is in the Czech Republic and, according to the husband, belonged to a former tennis player whom he used to coach, the barrister said.

'(Ownership) has been transferred to the wife, so in our submission, it is up to her to retrieve it,' he told the judge.

Miss Kisser said that the tennis player - David Rikl, a former Wimbledon doubles finalist - had told Mrs Hope Lewis, "we’ve got the car - come and get it in the Czech Republic if you want to try your hand," - that is his position.'

International lifestyle: Libor Krejci, 63, a former tennis coach turned property developer, led an 'international lifestyle', including yachting and playing polo with royalty, off the back of an off-shore family trust worth at least £30m, according to his ex-wife, Gillian Hope Lewis.

Arguing that it is Mr Krejci’s responsibility to track down and deliver up the vehicles to his ex, the barrister added: 'It is for him and his company to take proceedings in the Czech Republic.'

Mrs Hope Lewis’ then barrister, Duncan Brooks, told the Appeal Court last year that Mr Krejci 'is a man of contradiction.'

'To the court, in these proceedings, he is penniless and staving off the insolvency of the company that has been his life’s work.

'To the public at large he is the polo-playing friend of Prince Charles and the beneficiary of an off-shore trust with assets exceeding £30m, including properties in Monaco, Geneva, New York and Prague.'

The barrister also claimed that 'post-separation, the husband had continued to live life as before, funded via the trust.'

He added: 'By contrast, the wife...was not funded by the trust and was left penniless...Mr Krejci continued to lead an international lifestyle, developing properties and spending much of his time sailing. All of this was conducted behind the veil of the trust.'

The full committal hearing, which could see Mr Krejci put behind bars if he does not hand over the vehicles and the number plate, is now set to come back before the High Court in the New Year.

Mr Krejci also has another challenge pending in the Court of Appeal, which will be heard first.

Outside court, the husband’s barrister estimated the value of the two properties at about £1m, though the equity in them is believed to be less than £100,000.

The value of the vehicles and number plate is a matter of dispute between the former spouses.
