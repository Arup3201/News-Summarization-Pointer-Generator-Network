Jose Pekerman has signed a new contract to stay in charge of Colombia until 2018.

Argentinian Pekerman, 64, has been rewarded for steering his side to the quarter-finals of the World Cup in Brazil where they were knocked out by the tournament hosts. 

The Colombian federation said: 'The Executive Committee expresses its pride in continuing with this great group of people that brought great results to the country.'

Pekerman's side topped Group C with a 100 per cent record after beating Greece, Ivory Coast and Japan and saw off their fellow South Americans Uruguay in the last 16 with two goals from James Rodriguez. 

Real Madrid's summer signing topped the scoring charts with six goals for Pekerman's team.
