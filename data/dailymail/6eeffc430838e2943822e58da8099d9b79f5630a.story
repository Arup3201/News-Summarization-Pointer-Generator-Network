Tarbuck spent 11 months on police bail, during which time he was unable to work

Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck has said accusers in sexual assault cases should be named, after his harrowing ordeal when he spent nearly a year on police bail. 

The entertainer said he had suffered the 'worst year imaginable' since his arrest in April 2013 as part of the £2.7million Operation Yewtree triggered by Jimmy Savile's abuses.

Tarbuck spent 11 months on police bail, during which time he was unable to work.

But in March he was told there would be no charges over an allegation of child sex abuse in the 1970s made by six individuals.

Tarbuck, said he was relieved that his name has been cleared, but disturbed that those who pointed the finger at him remain anonymous while he was held in a blaze of publicity. 

In an interview with the Sunday People, he said: 'What can you do? The only thing that annoyed me, other than the lies, the total lies, is that they remain anonymous and no one knows who they are.

'It upset me. It upset my family. It was a lot of stress, but you do find out who your friends are at a time like that.

'You wake up at seven o'clock in  the morning with a knock on the door and there are 14 policemen up your drive and you've gotta go, "What?"

'One day when I write it out people won't believe it and will say, "It wasn't like that, was it?" I'll say, "Yes it was." It was blatant, total lies.'

Tarbuck said a group of women 'jumped on the bandwagon' after his arrest became public last year.

'They claimed I had made inappropriate sexual advances during Top of the Pops in 1963, he said.

'Not only have I never met these women, I have never appeared on Top of the Pops – which in any event didn't start until 1964.

'I would think on certain areas it's a witch-hunt. Maybe there has been a bit of a witch-hunt. And why? Is it envy? Is it greed? Is it illness? Is it mistaken identity? I don't know.'

Now, with his name untarnished, Tarbuck will mark a triumphant comeback on tonight's London Palladium show. 

And it has a special place in his heart, as it was the stage from where he hosted Saturday Night at the London Palladium for two years from 1965.

He said: 'It's just a thrill walking on that stage. You're playing in the Premier League and the Palladium is that - it doesn't get any better than that.

'The Palladium is the most famous theatre in the world.' 

The Liverpudlian comedian said he had suffered the 'worst year imaginable' but will make a comeback at the London Palladium tonight 

Known for his gap-toothed grin, broad Liverpudlian accent and love of golf, 'Tarby' began his showbusiness career aged 18 as a member of a touring rock and roll show and then as a Redcoat for a Butlins holiday camp in Brighton.

After leaving school at 15 his first jobs were as a mechanic and sweeping the floor of a ladies' hairdresser. He recalled: 'It was a brilliant way to meet girls.'

Tarbuck was classmates with John Lennon at Dovedale Junior School in Liverpool. He claimed the former Beatle once spiked his drink with speed.

The entertainer's first taste of mainstream success came in 1964, when he presented It's Tarbuck 65! on ITV.

He went on to host numerous quiz shows, including Winner Takes All and Full Swing. 

In the 1980s, he hosted Sunday night variety shows Live From Her Majesty's, Live from the Piccadilly and Live from the Palladium. He was awarded an OBE for services to showbusiness and charity in 1994.

David Lee Travis - The former Radio 1 star  was given a suspended sentence of three months for indecently assaulting a woman in 1995 last month. At an earlier trial, he was cleared of 12 counts of indecent assault, alleged to have taken place between 1976 and 2008.
