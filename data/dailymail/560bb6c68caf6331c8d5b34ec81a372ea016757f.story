Arsenal keeper David Ospina has joined up with his Colombia team-mates for the international break.

The in-form stopper helped the Gunners secure three vital points at Newcastle on Saturday with a series of fine saves as Arsenal prevailed 2-1 at Newcastle.

Victory keeps Arsene Wenger’s side hot on the heels of League leaders Chelsea and Manchester City with the international break upon the footballing world.

Colombia face Bahrain on Thursday before facing Kuwait at the end of the month in a duo of international friendlies.

Ospina was snapped on the plane out on Sunday by team-mate and Borussia Dortmund striker Adrian Ramos, who posted a picture from the cabin with Toulouse’s Abel Aguilar and Aston Villa’s Carlos Sanchez.

Ramos captioned the picture: ‘Again with family ... yes yes Colombia with my people…blessing’ as the quartet appeared in high spirits as Colombia look to build on a World Cup quarter-final outing last summer.
