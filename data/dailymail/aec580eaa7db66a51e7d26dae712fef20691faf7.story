A drinker was shocked to discover one of his pork scratchings bore the pig's identification marking 

Adrian Mullins was not put off the snack but said it was a 'brutal reminder' of where scratchings came from 

'I couldn't believe it when I lifted the pork scratching out of the bag and the numbers caught my eye.

'You could clearly see four numbers and I knew straight away it must have been the identification code for the pig.

'It was a bit of a brutal reminder of what pork scratchings are. I mean we all know it is deep fried pig skin but prefer not to think of it.

'How can you not when you can actually read the skin in your hand' 

The popular pub snack is Mr Mullins's favourite for when enjoying a pint of beer but said he prefers not to think of the fact that it is deep fried pig skin. Pictured is a packet of the brand in which the marked scratching was

Despite his surprise, Mr Mullins finished the packet with his drink at The Rifleman Pub in Twickenham 

Despite his shock, the businessman was not put off the snack.   

'I must admit it did put me off to start with. But then I thought what the hell and I still had my pint left so I ate it.

'Despite the writing it still tasted pretty good with my beer.'

Colin Brumdy, Quality Manager for Midlands Snacks which produces the scratchings, said: 'They are inspected but we are expecting millions of pieces of pork so you’ll get the odd piece of skin with the number on it. 

'It’s not going to harm anybody, the ink is perfectly safe and non-toxic. 

‘There is always the slight risk that it’ll get a number through.'
