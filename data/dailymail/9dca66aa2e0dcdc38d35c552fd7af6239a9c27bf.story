School sport is in decline despite a pledge to use the Olympics to encourage more children to take part, figures have shown.

Teachers are spending 60 per cent less time organising competitions and after-school clubs since the Coalition cut funding for school sports.

The figures are sensitive for the Government since a key pledge that helped win the Olympics for London was a promise to 'inspire young people around the world to choose sport'.

Drop: Teachers are spending 60 per cent less time organising competitions and after-school clubs since the Coalition cut funding for school sports

Figures uncovered by Labour under the Freedom of Information Act suggest a decline in the amount of sport being organised in all English regions following the overhaul.

They show a 60 per cent decrease in days worked per week by PE teachers on release compared with sports co-ordinators working under the old scheme in 2009/10.

Clive Efford, shadow minister for sport, said: 'It is incredible that David Cameron can complain that too many of our top sports people come from private schools when he is damaging the structure of sport in our state education system.'

A Department for Education spokesman said: 'We're spending £65million over the academic years 2011/12 and 2012/13 to release a secondary PE teacher in every school for one day a week so that opportunities in competitive sport are increased.'

Issue: Education Secretary Michael Gove drew a storm of criticism from athletes and head teachers two years ago

Education Secretary Michael Gove drew a 
storm of criticism from athletes and head teachers two years ago after 
threatening to axe a national network of School Sports Partnerships.

He was forced into a partial U-turn and 
agreed to fund a new scheme which allows PE teachers to be released from
 their schools for one day a week to help co-ordinate local sports 
provision.

But the budget for the scheme was smaller than funding for sports partnerships as the Coalition implemented austerity measures.

In the West Midlands and North East, the figures were 74 per cent and 72 per cent respectively.

Speaking in Singapore in 2005, Lord Coe 
said: 'London's vision is to reach young people around the world.

'To 
connect them with the inspirational power of the Games. So they are 
inspired to choose sport.' 

However the new figures suggest a 
decline in the amounted of sports being organised by schools, including 
local tournaments after-school clubs.

The withdrawal of funding for school sports partnerships led to a decline in their numbers of 37 per cent, the data showed.

More than a quarter of local authorities no longer have any.

Some areas have managed to keep the 
networks going but responses from local authorities suggested a decline 
in sporting participation, with Wokingham reporting that 'a drop-off is 
evident without whole partnership meetings and limited staffing 
capacity'.

Harrow, meanwhile, noted 'a drop in 
children's participation in sport and school's participation in 
coordinated extra-curricular activity'.

The Coalition has instead focused efforts on creating a new school games aimed at reviving competitive sport.

The tournament has reached more than half of schools.

There has also been lottery funding and 
investment in encouraging older teenagers and young adults to 
participate in sport amid evidence youngsters lose interest after 
leaving school.

But Tessa Jowell, shadow Olympics 
minister, said: 'When we won the Games, we made a promise to the people 
of this country and the international community to inspire a generation 
of young people through sport.

'The Olympic and Paralympic Games are a once in a lifetime event that will get young people excited about sport.

'It is important that schools are able 
to maintain this momentum and help young people develop sport and 
exercise as a habit that will keep them healthy and fit for the rest of 
their lives.'
