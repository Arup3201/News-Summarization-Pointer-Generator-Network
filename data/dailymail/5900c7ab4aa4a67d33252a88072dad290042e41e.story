Dawn had just broken over the squalid, stinking campsite that had been the young Afghan’s home by the dockside in Calais for the last three months.

When 20-year-old Morad Mohammed looked out of his makeshift tent there was a French policeman in riot gear telling him to get up and go.

‘Where?’ he asked the officer as he watched the site being dismantled and destroyed all around him.

‘Go to UK,’ the policeman told him. ‘It’s easy.’

Desperate: Migrants push against a steel barrier as their camp in Calais disappears before their eyes. Not one said the action would alter their hopes of getting to Britain to start a new life

That was how the French authorities yesterday thought they could solve the long-standing problem of migrants using the port as a waiting room for a new life in Britain.

But today – within hours of the campsite being cleared – the daily struggle by refugees and chancers trying to smuggle themselves aboard a lorry or cling to a cross-Channel train was set to start again.

Yet, even in the long and difficult history of Calais as a stepping stone towards the white cliffs of Dover, yesterday was dramatically different. Everywhere the would-be Britons looked when they emerged into the daylight, they saw police vans, gendarmes and officers in full riot gear.

Somewhere in the distance, a brace of bulldozers was waiting to move in and flatten everything to the ground.

And so, in a carefully planned operation to rid the French port of this eyesore and its unwanted controversy and in a fierce confrontation with those demanding human rights for the migrants, another chapter in a years-old saga came to a close. If only it was the finale. But even as mechanical diggers were crushing tents and turning three campsites back into swathes of empty wasteland, anyone you spoke to would tell you it won’t end here.

‘Not until I get to England or die trying,’ as one put it yesterday.

Nor is it likely to halt an immigration merry-go-round which arrest, deportation, beatings and appalling conditions have repeatedly failed  to stop.

One charity worker said Calais ‘will always be a magnet of hope’ for the thousands who see it as the last stop before Britain.

Face off: A migrant confronts a row of grim-faced French riot officers in body armour as his possessions are cleared

Last night that determination was underlined by little clutches of people, cold and homeless, but far from hopeless, wandering the streets, sitting in doorways, sleeping under bushes – and waiting for the next chance to try.

It took months to turn this camp into somewhere that up to 1,000 migrants colonised; less than two hours to destroy it.

Authorities insisted it had to be cleared because of an outbreak of scabies, a skin condition caused by mites (although none of the migrants I spoke to yesterday knew anyone who had been infected).

Scuffles broke out as armed police used shields and batons to corral and drive back scores of migrants whose base was being flattened before their eyes, often with their possessions still inside their tents.

A few hundred yards away, a P&O ferry was loading lorries and other vehicles before setting sail for England. Everyone knew there would be another one soon.

Time to move: A gendarme peers into one of the makeshift shelters used by migrants in the Calais camp

Yasir Muhammad, a 25-year-old student, sat on a grass bank with some companions as the diggers moved in. He told me he was kidnapped by Taliban supporters from his home in Peshawar, had a hood put over his head and was threatened with his life. He abandoned his dream of studying to become a zoologist and fled. He and his family paid 10,000 US dollars to a fixer to get him to Iran, then through Turkey, Greece, Italy and France.

He has been in Calais for the past four months, despite being deported twice to Italy, the country that holds his fingerprints. Each time he has returned; next stop London.

‘I will get there,’ he tells me, pointing out to sea with the only remnant of his former home – a glass-fibre tent pole. In a daily routine that spans morning, noon and night, he calculates he has tried more than 400 times to get to Britain. With a smile, he adds: ‘One day, I know that I will succeed.’

Nearby young Morad (his name means ‘Wish’) was describing the ‘very frightening’ moment he was woken and beaten by a police officer ordering him to get out of his tent.

The student, who says his family was murdered, left the camp with nothing but his clothes when the police moved in.

Levelled: A digger ploughs into shelters, crushing them and the possessions occupants couldn't save

Another Afghan, probably in his 30s, complained: ‘No one explained what was happening. We were just told to move. Now we have nowhere to stay, nowhere to sleep. We have lost everything.

‘But we still have our human rights. Here, they give you nothing. In Britain, they give you a house, somewhere to sleep. That is where  I will go.’

Yesterday charity and support groups – as well as activists demanding fair treatment for the migrants – brought food and water and handed out numbered tickets to exchange for blankets.

About 300 were moved to an open-air compound for the night as volunteers prepared meals for them. One stood talking in French among a group of maybe 100 displaced ex-campsite dwellers and told me: ‘They are prepared to risk their lives to get to England and they’re not going to give up.

‘They don’t want to stay in France. They cannot go home. So yes, they will be back. If not here, then somewhere else in Calais.

‘It is a cycle, a continuing cycle. It is their gateway to the UK. The authorities? They can close the gate, but people will still find a way.’
