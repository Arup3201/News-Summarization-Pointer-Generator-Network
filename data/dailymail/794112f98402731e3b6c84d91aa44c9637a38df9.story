The Alabama fan who took football fandom to the next level by poisoning rival school Auburn’s cherished, century-old oak tree has been sentenced to three years in jail.

Harvey Updyke, Jr. first made himself known as the superfan who poisoned the Auburn oaks when he called into an Alabama sports radio show in January 2012 under the pseudonym ‘Al’ and gloated about the late 2010 misdeed.

The following day, Auburn authorities tested the soils around the gnarled old oaks and found lethal amounts of the herbicide tebuthiuron.

Updyke was arrested and charged with the crime in February 2011.

Guilty: Alabama fan Harvey Updyke admitted he poisoned rival Auburn University's cherished oak trees and was given three years in jail

He pleaded guilty on Friday to criminal damage of an agricultural facility.

The split -sentence requires him to serve at least six months in jail and spend five years on supervised probation for the Class C felony.

He has been credited with 104 days already served since his bond was revoked after a September incident in which he allegedly threatened employees at a Lowe's store and was arrested.

Updyke managed to go through eight attorneys since he was initially charged. He also reportedly confessed to a student reporter in 2012 and then publicly denied the confession ever happened.

The former Texas state trooper was also fined $1,000.

Cherished: Since the 1950s, Auburn fans have celebrated wins by 'rolling' the trees in toilet paper, but the 130-year-old oaks are now at death's door

The probation terms include a 7 p.m. curfew and prohibit Updyke from going onto Auburn's campus or attending a college sporting event.

Auburn fans traditionally gather at Toomer's Corner to celebrate victories, and the case further highlighted the emotions in the year-round in-state rivalry during the two-plus years since Updyke was arrested.

'We have a significant number of violent felonies awaiting trial in Lee County and I could not in good conscience justify financing a three-week trial merely to arrive at no better a resolution,' Lee County District Attorney Robbie Treese said in a statement.

Updyke, 64, had pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to charges of poisoning the trees during Auburn's successful bid for the national championship in the 2010 football season.

Updyke had been charged with criminal mischief, desecrating a venerated object and damaging agriculture.

As a result of Updyke's plea Friday, prosecutors will not pursue those charges, according to court documents.

Updyke is also banned from that store under the probation terms.

Shameful: Despite efforts to salvage the trees, the Toomer's Corner Oaks cannot be saved and will be removed in April

Farewell: A final, goodbye roll will be held for the beloved trees April 20, before they're removed three days later

Treese said restitution amounts would be determined later and are automatically doubled under Alabama law.

The DA said expenses would have included transportation and lodging of up to 50 witnesses and fees for several experts.

'Whether or not, Mr. Updyke can manage to stay on probation is entirely up to him,' Treese said. 'Despite the destruction he has caused, no one is capable of diminishing the spirit of our community.'

Auburn fans traditionally 'roll' the trees in toilet paper after a win, a tradition that dates back to the 1950s.

Tigers fans will have one final, goodbye roll on April 20. The now-skeletal trees are scheduled to be removed three days later.
