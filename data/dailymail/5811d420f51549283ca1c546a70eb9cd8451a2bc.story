The energy firm in a £25million pay row was accused of blackmail by shareholders yesterday.

BG Group has warned that Helge Lund may turn down the post of chief executive if investors do not approve his £25million pay offer.

But ShareSoc, which represents individual shareholders in the group, said there was no excuse for the huge sum, which includes a £12million ‘golden welcome’.

Mark Bentley, ShareSoc’s director, said: ‘We cannot succumb to the blackmail implicit in the statement. I would be happy for Mr Lund to be appointed as chief executive, but see no reason why they needed to offer such a vast package to him.’

Shareholders are supposed to decide on the pay offer at an emergency meeting on December 15 but there are calls for the vote to be scrapped. 

Royal London Asset Management, a major shareholder that had backed Mr Lund, said it would vote against the measure even if it meant losing him.

The investment firm’s Ashley Hamilton Claxton said: ‘The responsible thing to do is to call a halt to the vote and enter into meaningful discussions with shareholders in order to reach an acceptable outcome which motivates the chief executive and clearly aligns his interests to shareholders.’

‘Barring that, we plan to vote against the pay package.’

Four of the company’s 15 biggest shareholders have publicly criticised the pay deal and many other significant investors have said privately they cannot support it.

One of the biggest names to oppose the arrangement so far is Glass Lewis, the US-based group that advises pension funds on how to vote on pay issues. It was behind the removal of James Murdoch from the board of Sky two years ago.

Other corporate governance giants to have come out against the deal include Institutional Shareholder Services and Pensions & Investment Research Consultants.

The UK Corporate Governance code warns companies against ‘ratcheting up remuneration levels’ and tells them to be sensitive when setting executive pay.

It says firms should avoid paying more than is necessary.

But there is growing evidence that BG Group has ignored the concerns of investors in the latest row. Mr Bentley has met Sir John Hood, the company’s pay chief, to express worries over its salary policies.

‘He has completely ignored these concerns and just gone ahead with this,’ Mr Bentley said. ‘This is very much a case of vested interests’.

Sir John, who is on £153,000 a year, is chairman of the remuneration committee at BG Group, the body of five directors who are paid £1million a year and who proposed Mr Lund’s deal.

He is also the remuneration chief at the advertising giant WPP – which has experienced significant investor revolts over the past two years over its pay awards for Sir Martin Sorrell.

A BG spokesman said: ‘We believe Helge Lund is the right person to lead BG Group.

‘His proposed remuneration is competitive in the international oil and gas industry.’

BG Group was part of British Gas when privatised, but became a separate company in 1997.
