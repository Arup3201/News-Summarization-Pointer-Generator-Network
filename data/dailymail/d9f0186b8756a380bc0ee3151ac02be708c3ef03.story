Everywhere you go you run the risk of leaving traces of your DNA behind – from fingerprints, to skin, hair and cigarette butts.

A Brooklyn-based firm is so concerned this DNA could be collected and stored by authorities it has created a range of sprays designed to help people delete it from all surfaces.

A limited number of Invisible sprays are due to go on sale in June for $99 (£58) to protect people’s privacy, but, in theory, it could also be used by criminals to commit crimes without getting caught.

The Invisible range of sprays has been created by Brooklyn artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg and her new company BioGenFutures. The Erase spray, pictured left, is said to remove 99.95% of DNA from surfaces, while Replace, pictured right, removes the final 0.5% by mixing it with other genetic material

The Invisible range consists of two different sprays that can be used as a pair, or separately.

The first is called Erase and it’s an ‘antiDNA cleaning product’ similar to a disinfectant spray.

While
 Replace is an obfuscation spray that adds a mixture of genetic material
 to a DNA sample to cloak the details of the original.

This means customers can either wipe everything clean, or leave an alternate DNA sample to protect their privacy.

The Invisible range of sprays was created by genetic privacy company BioGenFutures, set up by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg.

Last year, Dewey-Hagborg set up the Stranger Visions exhibition in which she created realistic 3D portrait sculptures of strangers using DNA she collected from public places. 

According to the BioGenFutures sites, Invisible is a set of sprays that can be used to remove or obfuscate a person’s residual DNA left on door handles, keyboards, train seats, or in restaurants and pubs.

The first spray is called Erase and it’s an ‘antiDNA cleaning product’ similar to a disinfectant spray.

'Replace', on the other hand, is an obfuscation spray that adds a mixture of genetic material to a DNA sample to cloak the details of the original. 

Invisible was created by genetic privacy firm BioGenFutures, set up by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, pictured spraying Erase onto a glass. BioGenFutures' website claims the product goes on sale in June for $99 (£58) and customers can use it to wipe everything clean, or leave an alternate genetic sample to protect their privacy

This means customers can either wipe everything clean, or leave an alternate DNA sample to protect their privacy.

The site does, however, feature endorsements from genetic experts including Jeremy Gruber, President of the Council for Responsible Genetics who said: ‘No-one should be able to take another person’s DNA without consent and mine it for information.

‘The promises of the genetic revolution 
will not be fully realised if concerns over unauthorised testing of DNA 
and its misuse are not addressed. Invisible represents a critical step 
towards achieving that goal.’

This graphic reveals that the average person sheds 50 strands of hair each day and each strand contains five nanograms of DNA. Only 0.5 nanograms of DNA is required for standard forensic analysis

BioGenFutures continued: ‘Genetic information is inadvertently discarded by billions each day through shed hairs and lashes, dropped cigarette butts and gum, or saliva left on glasses and silverware.

In addition to being accidentally discarded, DNA is routinely extracted and often stored from infants at birth, and as criminal DNA databases are expanding exponentially.

‘Law enforcement now routinely profiles individuals convicted of even petty crimes, tending toward permanent storage of both profiles and biological samples from individuals arrested for but never convicted of a crime.’

Commenting on the spray,  Dr John Bond from Leicester University 
told MailOnline: 'It is easy to remove DNA with a good clean, with 
biological washing powder for example.

'I can’t see any implications for criminal 
investigation as this would require a criminal to spray around after 
themselves cleaning up. 

'Given that, today, criminals still don’t wear 
gloves I can’t see this being effective. 

'I think its cashing in on the 
‘hype’ surrounding DNA analysis and the (unjustified) fear that people 
have that it will be used for non-criminal investigation purposes.'
