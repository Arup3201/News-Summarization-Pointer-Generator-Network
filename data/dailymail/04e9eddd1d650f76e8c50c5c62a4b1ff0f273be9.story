A long line of cars and trucks 
collided one after another early yesterday on a dark Florida highway so 
shrouded in haze and smoke that drivers were instantly blinded. At least
ten people were killed.

When rescuers first arrived, they 
could only listen for screams and moans because the poor visibility made
it difficult to find victims in wreckage that was strewn for nearly a 
mile, police said.

Authorities were still trying to 
determine what caused the pileup south of Gainesville on Interstate 75, 
which had been closed for a time before the accidents because of the 
mixture of fog and heavy smoke from a brush fire that may have been 
intentionally set. At least a dozen cars and six tractor-trailers were 
involved, and some burst into flames.

Deadly crash: At least ten are dead and many more injured after a multi-vehicle wreck on Interstate 75 at Paynes Prairie, Florida today

Steven R Camps of Gainesville said he
and some friends were driving home several hours before dawn when they 
were drawn into the pileup.

'You could hear cars hitting each 
other. People were crying. People were screaming. It was crazy,' he 
said. 'If I could give you an idea of what it looked like, I would say 
it looked like the end of the world.'

Another traumatised driver, Donna Henry, recounted the 
moment she hit the smoke: ‘We just hit it, and you couldn’t see 
anything.'

In an interview with the Sun, Ms Henry said she was driving home from a trip with her friends when they hit the 
darkness. Her Toyota struck a guardrail, but she managed to pull off of 
the road.

From there, all she could do was listen. She placed a call with 911, but
during the call, she heard at least 15 cars colliding into each other 
‘from this side and that, north and south. It was bad,' she said.

Photographs of the scene taken hours 
later revealed an aftermath that resembled a Hollywood disaster movie. 
Twisted, burned-out vehicles were scattered across the pavement, with 
smoke still rising from the wreckage.

Cars appeared to have smashed into 
the big rigs and, in one case, a motor home. Some cars were crushed 
beneath the heavier trucks.

Reporters who were allowed to view 
the site saw bodies still inside a burned-out Grand Prix. One 
tractor-trailer was burned down to its skeleton, charred pages of books 
and magazines in its cargo area. And the tires of every vehicle had 
burned away, leaving only steel belts.

other. People were crying. People were screaming. It was crazy. If I could give you an idea of what it looked like, I would say 
it looked like the end of the world.'

Before Mr Camps hit the fog bank, a 
friend who was driving ahead of him in a separate vehicle called to warn
of the road conditions. The friend said he had just seen an accident 
and warned Camps to be careful as he approached the Paynes Prairie area 
just south of Gainesville.

A short time later, Mr Camps said, traffic stopped along the northbound lanes.

'You couldn't see anything. People were pulling off the road,' he said.

Mr Camps said he began talking about the
road conditions to a man in the car stopped next to them when another 
vehicle hit the man's car.

The man's vehicle was crushed under a
semi-truck stopped in front of them. Camps said his car was hit twice, 
but he and another friend were able to jump out. They took cover in the 
grass on the shoulder of the road.

All around them, cars and trucks were on fire, and they could hear explosions as the vehicles burned.

'It was happening on both sides of 
the road, so there was nowhere to go. It blew my mind,' he said, 
explaining that the scene 'looked like someone was picking up cars and 
throwing them.'

Authorities had not released the 
names of victims Sunday evening, but said one passenger car had four 
fatalities and a 'tour bus-like' vehicle also was involved in the 
pileup.

'Our standard operating procedure is 
to get the road open as quickly as possible but let's not forget we have
ten people who are not with us today. So we are going to take our time 
assessing the situation.'

- Florida Highway Patrol spokesman Lieutenant Patrick Riordan

At least 18 people were were being treated at Shands at the 
University of Florida, said hospital spokeswoman Allison Wilson.

A crash scene investigator told the newspaper that it will take some time to investigate each individual crash.

All six lanes of the interstate – 
which runs virtually the entire length of Florida – were closed most of 
Sunday afternoon as investigators surveyed the site and firefighters put
out the last of the flames.

The northbound lanes of I-75 were reopened around 5:30pm EST, but the southbound lanes remained closed.

'Our standard operating procedure is 
to get the road open as quickly as possible but let's not forget we have
ten people who are not with us today,' said Lieutenant Patrick Riordan,
a Florida Highway Patrol spokesman. 'So we are going to take our time 
assessing the situation.'

It was not clear when the highway would fully reopen because part of the road melted, police said.

At some point before the pileup, 
police briefly closed the highway because of the fog and smoke. The road
was reopened when visibility improved.

Riordan said he was not sure how much time passed between the reopening of the highway and the first crash.

Traffic was being diverted much of Sunday onto U.S. 301 and State Road 27, Riordan said.

A spokeswoman for the Florida Forest 
Service, Ludie Bond, said the fire began Saturday, and investigators 
were trying to determine whether the blaze had been intentionally set. 
She said there were no controlled burns in the area and no lightning.

Bond also said the fire had burned 62
acres and was contained but still burning Sunday. A similar fire nearby
has been burning since mid-November because the dried vegetation is so 
thick and deep. No homes are threatened.

Four years ago, heavy fog and smoke were blamed for another serious crash.

In January 2008, four people were 
killed and 38 injured in a series of similar crashes on Interstate 4 
between Orlando and Tampa, about 125 miles south of Sunday's crash. More
than 70 vehicles were involved in those crashes, including one pileup 
that involved 40 vehicles.
