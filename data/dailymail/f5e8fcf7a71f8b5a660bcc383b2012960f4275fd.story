Joe Biden held an ‘emotional one-on-one meeting’ with Barack Obama and ‘apologized profusely’ after announcing his support for gay marriage in May, according to a new book.

The Vice-President also accused Jim Messina, the Obama campaign manager, of ‘throwing him under the bus’, an e-book published by Politico has revealed.

Obama tried to calm Biden down, saying: ‘Look, Joe, there are people who want to divide us. You and I have to be on the same page from now on. You and I have to make sure that we don’t get divided.’

After Biden’s ill-judged utterance, Obama was forced to bring forward his own announcement of support for gay marriage, which he had planned to make at the Democratic convention in Charlotte, North Carolina this month.

The incident underlines the extent to which Biden’s garrulous manner and inability to stick to a prearranged message has become a problem for the White House and the Obama campaign.

It also highlights, however, Obama’s apparent loyalty to Biden, whom he picked as his running mate even though he had failed to win a single state in two presidential campaigns 20 years apart.

Biden had served 36 years in the Senate and was lampooned for his long-winded nature even in an institution renowned for the excessive self-regard and verbosity of its members.

Last week, there was dismay among 
Democrats and jubilant cat-calling, coupled with some genuine outrage, 
from Republicans after Biden told supporters, including many blacks, at 
an event in Virginia that Republicans wanted ‘to put ya’ll back in 
chains’.

The deeply-reported e-book, called Obama's Last Stand, also lays bare how a spat between David Axelrod, Obama’s chief strategist, and Stephanie Cutter, the high-profile deputy campaign manager, left them ‘barely on speaking terms’.

It also reveals concerns within the Obama campaign about the abrasive Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz after private polling was commissioned as to how various leading Democrats were perceived and she ranked least popular

Obama was reportedly furious that Jim Margolis, an ad consultant, had sought to burnish his own image in a newspaper profile, and livid that a campaign stunt in Boston engineered by Axelrod had backfired.

There is also criticism from Messina over the president’s high-minded criticism of super PACs following the 2010 Citizens United decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Messina reportedly said of Obama and Axelrod: ‘We’re going to lose this f****** thing. Why don’t they get it?’
