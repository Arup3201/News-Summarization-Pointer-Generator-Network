Statins have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects on the nervous system.

Previous research using simvastatin in people with early-stage MS found reductions in brain lesions, suggesting the statin was affecting the disease process.

British researchers randomly assigned 140 patients with secondary progressive MS to receive either 80mg of simvastatin (costing £2 a month) or placebo (dummy pill) for two years.

Brain MRI scans showed a reduction in the average atrophy rate to 0.3 per cent a year with simvastatin, a 43 per cent reduction (when adjusted for factors such as age and gender) compared with placebo.

Small but significant improvements in disability were noted by doctors and patients, while serious adverse events were similar between the two groups.

Study leader Dr Jeremy Chataway of University College London Hospitals, said ‘In the progressive stage of MS the brain shrinks by about 0.6 per cent a year.

Our main measure of success was to reduce the rate of brain atrophy.’

‘Caution should be taken regarding over-interpretation of our brain imaging findings, because these might not necessarily translate into clinical benefit.

‘However, our promising results warrant further investigation in larger phase 3 disability-driven trials.’

Professor John Greenwood at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, who has investigated the possible benefits of statins in autoimmune diseases such as MS and uveitism, said: ‘After nearly two decades of research, it is immensely gratifying to see this work progress into the clinic to deliver benefits to patients.’

Dr Susan Kohlhaas, head of biomedical research at the MS Society, said: ‘There are no treatments that can stop the condition from worsening in people with progressive MS.

‘Scientists have worked for years to find a potential treatment that could help people, and now, finally, one has been found. This is very exciting news.

‘Further, larger clinical trials are now absolutely crucial to confirm the safety and effectiveness of this treatment, but for now, people with MS should be really encouraged by these results.’
