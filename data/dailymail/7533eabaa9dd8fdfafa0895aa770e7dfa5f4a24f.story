Kato Kaelin, the bit-part actor who became famous overnight as OJ Simpson's house-guest at the time of his ex-wife's murder, has revealed that OJ tried to persuade him to provide an alibi for that fatal night 20 years ago.

On the 20th anniversary of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, Kaelin spoke to Today along with the father and sister of Mr Goldman. The pair were found brutally stabbed to death at Ms Brown Simpson's LA home on June 12, 1994.

Kaelin was staying in a guest house at OJ Simpson's compound
 and was present at the time the murders took place. He appeared as a prosecution witness at OJ's murder trial before a rapt but unforgiving public where he was criticized for his rambling, arrogant testimony and dubbed a 'beach bum' and 'parasitic freeloader'.

Kaelin said on Wednesday that his life was changed forever by the murders of which Simpson was sensationally acquitted after a grueling eight-month, televised trial in 1995.

'Kato the character': The struggling actor was living in a house on Simpson's property at the time of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman's murders in June 1994 and was later called to testify (left).  He said today (pictured right) that the events turned his life upside down and made him an infamous public figure whom people still have opinions on 

'One day I walk into a courtroom. I 
walk out of a courtroom and everybody’s shouting my name. I became this 
public figure and everybody had an opinion,' Kaelin said.

'I
 was Kato the character. Still to this day I can’t believe some of the 
hate that can come over social media. If I work, they say you’re 
capitalizing, still to this day, If I don’t, then I’m a bum.'

When asked by Today host Matt Lauer if there were things he could have done differently, Kaelin said: 'I testified to things that I knew, not what I thought happened. And that's the God's honest truth.

'A lot of times, people would say: "He
 looked like a deer in the headlights." It's because I sat in with the 
prosecution for over 20 hours and if a question came in during the 
trial, I was going "I don't remember that question."

'Being on camera, it's always on you. People were going "look at that guy, he's lying, he's like a deer in the headlights."'

Kaelin, whose real name is Brian Jerard, also revealed to Dateline, in an episode to be aired tonight, that OJ had tried to persuade him to provide an alibi.

He said: 'He
 [Simpson] had tried to talk to me one time and tell me, ''You know 
where I was Kato, you know I was in the kitchen at this time''.

'He was in 
the kitchen trying to convince me about what I believe now was an alibi 
for him.'

On the 20th anniversary of the murders of Ron Goldman and OJ Simpson's ex-wife Nicole, Goldman's father Fred (center) and sister Kim (left) spoke to the Today show on Wednesday along with Kato Kaelin

Fred Goldman appeared alongside Kaelin on the morning show on Wednesday and said that 20 years after his son Ron's death, the pain of losing him has never faded.

Mr
 Goldman, 73, said: 'The loss is exactly the same. It's just become a new normal, 
minus my son. Without any of the opportunity to share his life with him, his joys, his happinesses, his successes… all of that is gone.'

Ron Goldman's sister Kim Goldman said today: 'After my brother died, I didn’t know what that was because everything shifted and I was lost for a really long time.'

Ms Goldman said that in the 20 years that have passed since she lost her brother, she has learned 'that I'm resilient, that I'm a fighter, I'm loyal and committed and I know what family is about'.

Mr Goldman added: 'If nothing else, I have learned how to adjust. How to change but not change.'

Lives cut short: Ron Goldman was 25 and Nicole Brown Simpson was 35 when they were viciously stabbed to death in front of her condominium on North Bundy Drive. Ron was stabbed almost 60 times

The bloody glove: 'If it doesn't fit you must acquit,' said defense attorney Johnnie Cochran about the bloody glove found at the guest bungalow in back of OJ's Rockingham home. Simpson is pictured at his murder trial in 1995

Bloodbath: The pathway leading to Nicole's door was a horror show of bloody footprints on June 12, 1994. Nicole's body lay at the end of the walkway just below the steps to her door

Fred Goldman revealed to MailOnline this week that OJ's 'Dream Team' lawyer, Robert Kardashian carried away evidence in a suitcase from 
the former footballer's home the night his ex-wife Nicole Brown-Simpson 
and her friend Ron Goldman were viciously stabbed to death – and took 
the secret of where it is to his grave.

‘That evidence would have convicted "the 
killer",’ he said, who to this day refuses to 
refer to the disgraced football player by name. Kardashian, the father of reality TV stars Kim, 
Khloe and Kourtney, died of esophageal cancer in 2003.

Witnesses whose claims appear to support Mr Goldman's opinion of Simpson's guilt have come forward this week - sharing for the first time information that the murder trial jury never heard.

One of those is Rob Kardashian's former wife, Kris Jenner, who was one of Nicole Brown Simpson's closest friends.

The reality TV matriarch told Dateline that Nicole had confided in her that she feared for her life in the weeks before her murder.

Kris Jenner, a close friend of Nicole Brown Simpson, told Dateline this week that Nicole told her she feared that OJ would kill her and would get away with it

Kris Jenner: 'She told me: ''Things are really bad between OJ and I and he's going to kill me and he's going to get away with it. You'll watch and see what happens.'' She knew exactly what was going to happen to her.'

The jury also never heard from Skip Junis who claimed that he saw OJ throwing things away at LAX Airport on the night of the murders.

Mr Junis told Dateline: 'A limousine pulled up and OJ Simpson got out of the limousine. He was carrying this little cheap gym bag.

'He zipped it just a little bit at the bottom and was reaching his hand in and pulling things out and putting them in a trash can.'

The jury in the OJ Simpson trial never heard from Skip Junis (pictured left) who said he saw OJ throw items into the trash at an airport on the night of the murders. Jill Shively (right) said she saw Simpson drive past her close to the crime scene minutes after the murders were believed to have taken place. She did not testify because she sold her story to the media

Defense attorney Carl Douglas told Dateline that he redecorated OJ's house to give the jury a better impression of it before viewing. He said: 'This is not tampering with evidence...They play hard in the big leagues'

Another witness Jill Shively told police she saw Simpson driving his white Bronco SUV near the crime scene minutes after the murders are believed to have taken place. She never testified in court because she sold her story to the press.

She told Dateline this week: 'All of a sudden, this white car comes flying north on Bundy with its lights out. I barely missed him. It was OJ Simpson.'

Simpson defense attorney Carl Douglas also revealed that he redecorated at OJ's house before the jury came to view the murder scene.

He also spoke to Dateline, saying: 'We wanted to make the location look lived in and stand with all of its regalness, so that the jurors would say, OJ Simpson would not have risked all of this for this woman. 

'This is not tampering with evidence... I'm trying to get the optimum advantage to win. They play hard ball in the big leagues. This was the big leagues.'

According to the Los Angeles Coroner's report, dated June 14, 1994, Ronald Goldman, who was 25 at the time of his death, was stabbed almost sixty times: in his neck, which severed his jugular vein - a fatal wound - the right side of his chest - a fatal wound - and his abdomen - also a fatal wound - but there were many more wounds, some defensive to his hands, but also to his thigh and scalp. 

The coroner describes many of the wounds as 'taunting' wounds, indicating that Ron may have been strategically stabbed to torture him before he died.

Nicole Brown-Simpson's neck was cut from ear-to-ear with her head almost severed from her body and she had been stabbed numerous times in other areas. She was 35, the mother of Sydney and Justin Simpson.

A few years after Simpson was found not guilty of the double murder, Fred Goldman and his family filed a wrongful death lawsuit and on February 5, 1997 the civil jury unanimously found the former NFL Hall-Of-Famer guilty of battery against Ron and Nicole.

Fred Goldman was awarded $33.5 million in damages but he and his family have seen only a fraction of the money.

When Simpson was convicted in Las Vegas, Nevada court on October 3, 2008 of conspiracy, kidnapping, robbery and assault with a deadly weapon - 13 years to the day after he was acquitted of the double murder of Nicole Brown-Simpson and Ron Goldman – Fred and Kim sent OJ a card at the Lovelock Correctional Center in Lovelock, Nevada.

‘We hope you enjoy your new home!' it read.

Simpson
is currently serving his 33-year sentence with the possibility of parole after
nine years. He went back to court in 2013 hoping to get his conviction overturned due to poor
legal representation but his request was denied by the court stating there was no merit for his accusations.

His earliest possible release date from the Nevada prison
will be in 2017.
