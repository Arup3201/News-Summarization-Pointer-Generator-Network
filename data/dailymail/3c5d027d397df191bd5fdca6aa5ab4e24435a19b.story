The sex scandal engulfing former CIA chief David Petraeus and America’s commander in Afghanistan deepened yesterday when it emerged the two men had personally intervened in a messy child custody battle.

While supposedly focused on the anti-terror agenda, two of the leading figures in the US security machine were writing glowing letters in support of the twin sister of the woman at the heart of the scandal.

The revelation in court documents of their intervention on behalf of Natalie Khawam – a woman a judge had ruled psychologically unstable – fuelled speculation over the extent of their involvement with her sister, Florida socialite Jill Kelley.

And in another twist in the affair, it was   reported that General John Allen, the US commander in Afghanistan, sent emails to Mrs Kelley that were so explicit they were akin to ‘phone sex’.

Allen, 58, is under investigation by the Pentagon over up to 30,000 pages of messages of allegedly ‘inappropriate communication’ between him and 37-year-old Mrs Kelley, a married mother of three.

She has been portrayed as a flirtatious, cunning social climber who assiduously cultivated both Allen and Petraeus, a four-star general who became CIA director in September 2011, and other senior officers while they were stationed at a base near her home in Tampa.

A former intelligence officer claimed yesterday that she even browbeat a special forces admiral into allowing her to jump with America’s top paratrooper commandos. ‘Do not ever bring that lady back here again,’ the parachute team leader said afterwards, according to the source.

And she was clearly equally determined to call in favours from the top brass when it came to helping her troubled twin.

A judge last year awarded Miss Khawam’s ex-husband custody of their three-year-old son, John, and ordered her to pay his legal bills of £221,000. Judge Neal Kravitz rejected her claims she had been a victim of domestic violence, criticising her ‘pattern of misrepresentations about virtually everything’.

The judge also condemned Mrs Kelley’s testimony that she had seen her brother-in-law push her sister down the stairs while clutching their baby, describing her as a ‘patently biased and unreliable witness’.

Miss Khawam, a lawyer, filed for bankrupcty in April after racking up £1.9million in debt and moved in with her sister and brother-in-law Scott, a cancer surgeon.

Little more than a week after a terrorist attack on the Benghazi consulate in which the ambassador to Libya was killed in September, Mrs Kelley’s friends in high places found time to back her sister in her legal battle.

Using his old title of ‘general’ and an envelope  embossed with four gold stars, Petraeus, 60, gushed in his letter to the court that ‘Natalie clearly dotes on her son and goes to great lengths – and great expense – to spend quality time with him’.

Whenever he and his wife, Holly, had seen the pair, including when they had them over at Christmas last year, they had seen a ‘very loving relationship’.

Writing two days later on September 22, Allen – Petraeus’s deputy when they were  stationed at Central Command on MacDill Air Force Base – said: ‘Natalie clearly loves John and cherishes each and every opportunity she has to spend time with him.’

Petraeus resigned last Friday after admitting he had been having an affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. The pair’s relationship was exposed after Mrs Kelley went to the FBI after receiving anonymous harassing emails. Investigators discovered not only that they had come from Mrs

Broadwell but also that she was having an affair with the CIA chief.But they also learnt that Mrs Kelley was exchanging thousands of what officials call ‘potentially inappropriate’ emails with Allen, who is married with two children. In fact, he, too, had been emailed by Broadwell who warned him to stay clear of Mrs Kelley as she was a ‘seductress’. 

Allen’s appointment as Supreme Commander of Nato forces in Europe has been put on hold while the Pentagon investigates the extent of his relationship with Mrs Kelley.

Yesterday Fox News said the pair became involved in much more than ‘flirtatious’ behaviour and quoted an insider saying the messages they exchanged were the ‘equivalent of phone sex over email’.

Last night Barack Obama said he was ‘withholding judgment’ on whether the FBI should have told the White House much earlier about its Petraeus inquiry.

Praising his ‘extraordinary service’ to his country, Mr Obama added: ‘By his own assessment, he did not  meet the standards he felt were necessary as the director of the CIA.’
