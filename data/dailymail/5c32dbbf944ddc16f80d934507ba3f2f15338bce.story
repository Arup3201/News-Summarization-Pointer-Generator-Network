John Terry might have fleetingly wondered if he was on the right plane as he jetted back from a European night in Portugal without Frank Lampard next to him.

Lampard, his travelling companion for 13 years, was making his way home from Manchester’s Etihad Stadium as, by chance, was Ashley Cole, in a reminder of a summer of accelerated change at Chelsea.

Didier Drogba was injured, Petr Cech among the substitutes, John Mikel Obi came on but Terry was in his usual place, in the centre of Chelsea’s defence, celebrating his own Champions League ton by beating Sporting Lisbon thanks to Nemanja Matic’s first-half header. 

John Terry became only the sixth Englishman to reach 100 Champions League appearances

It did not always seem likely but he is the last of the old guard, the only survivor from the original Jose Mourinho team to be integral to the new-build project. And he detects signs of progress and medals ahead. 

‘The most important thing is not the 100 appearances but to strive to go on and win the Champions League again,’ said Terry. ‘That’s the target of the club, the mentality of where we are as a club and has been for the last 10 years, since the owner came in. With Mourinho back in, that’s our target and that’s the standard.

When Chelsea lost in the semi-final last season, there were tears from Terry. To some it was a sign he was on his way out of the club he joined from school. Like Cole and Lampard, his contract was up but, as they were allowed to leave, he signed again.

David Luiz was sold to Paris Saint-Germain as Mourinho backed his 33-year-old skipper to be the solid base of a team he is creating to challenge for titles on all fronts.

‘I’ve fought off the competition. It’s what I’m hungry to do,’ said Terry. ‘I just want to win trophies. It’s what I’m born to do. It’s in me from when I was a kid. 

‘I was in tears over the Premier League last year, behind closed doors, over throwing it away. Emotions are what I play for, week in, week out. I’m never scared to show them.’

He has a winner’s medal but Europe’s top competition has not always been kind to Terry. He missed the decisive penalty in the 2008 final shoot-out and when Chelsea did triumph, four years later, he was suspended as punishment for kicking Alexis Sanchez, a player he will face again for Arsenal on Sunday.

‘Of course, it was the biggest night ever for the club and I didn’t play,’ said Terry. ‘But I played in one and I felt a massive part of it and the players made me feel a huge part of it. You look back at games like Napoli and others along the way where you played a big part.

‘Because it’s me, people say: “He’s not won it”. People like to have their digs and their pops, but I know I played a huge part along the way, in the dressing room and on the field.

‘I count myself to have won it. No one speaks about the other 10 players who weren’t on the pitch that night. Maybe that’s me and where I’m at as a player.’

It has been a turbulent career, with scandals on and off the pitch, but Terry seems to have quelled the storm, helped by the return of Mourinho, who values his leadership qualities and plays a tactical style that suits him.

The niggling injury problems which played a part as he slipped to fourth-choice centre-half under Rafa Benitez two years ago have eased and the captain stands as an example to the new guard: Cesc Fabregas, Diego Costa and Nemanja Matic.

‘They’re unbelievable players and big characters on and off the pitch,’ said Terry. ‘They’re what I call real men. Matic came back from Portugal a completely different player and a man.

‘Cesc has been here before, so he knew what to expect. With Diego we didn’t know. Some strikers take months but he’s hit the ground running with eight goals already.’
