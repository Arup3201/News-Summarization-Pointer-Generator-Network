A sheep in a knitted jumper may not, at first glance, seem the biggest advance in animation ever seen.

However, experts say the image could usher in a new era of characters wearing ultra-realistic clothes.

The images are the first time researchers have managed the incredibly complex feat of recreated knitting inside a computer.

The images of a sheep in a knitted jumper is the first time researchers have been able to 'virtually knit' an outfit, and could lead to far more realistic animated characters

To put clothes on their characters, 
computer graphic artists usually simulate cloth by creating a thin 
sheet, then adding some sort of texture.

However, this doesn't work for knitted garments, as they are simply too complex.

To make the image realistic, the computer has to simulate the surface right down to the intricate intertwining of yarn.

So computer scientists are in effect teaching the computer to knit.

The research, from Cornell University, was unveiled at a computer graphics conference.

'We are actually changing the shape of the yarn loops that make up the stitches,' Professor Steve Marschner from cornell, who led the research, explained, 'simulating how they wrap around other loops.'

The result is a simulation with detail down to the yarn level.

The trickiest part, Marschner said, is to make sure the images of yarn loops don't slide through each other like ghosts.

That would cause the simulation to "unravel" like a dropped stitch in real knitting.

The team has also revealed far more natural looking knitted outfits for human. Funded by Pixar, the research could be seen on a cinema screen soon.

The 
Cornell innovation is to create a 3-D model of a single stitch and then 
combine multiple copies into a mesh, like tiles in a mosaic.

The 
computer projects the mesh onto a model of the desired shape of the 
garment, treating each stitch as a tiny flat polygon that stretches and 
bends to fit the 3-D surface.

Then it "relaxes" the graphic image of 
each stitch to fit the shape of its polygon, just as real yarn would 
stretch and bend to fit the shape of the wearer.

In knitting, a single stitch is formed by pulling yarn through a loop. 
Rows of stitches, built on the loops formed by previous rows, make up 
the finished garment.

The yarn can be pulled through in a variety of 
ways or multiple times, creating various shapes and textures.

To 
simulate this realistically, a computer graphic artist would have to 
painstakingly model the 3-D structure of every stitch.

The researchers tested their method with several patterns from knitting 
books and created images of dresses, sweaters, a shawl and a tea cozy.

The simulations are highly realistic, but the researchers noted that the
results of knitting a particular pattern depend on the yarn and needles
used, as well as the style of the individual knitter.

The method has 
some parameters that can even be adjusted to simulate the effects of 
different needles or yarn, or different yarn tension used by the 
knitter, they said.

The research was supported by the National Science Foundation, the 
Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial 
Foundation and Pixar.

A range of different knitting techniques can now be virtually created and wrapped around a character's body.
