Thomas Francis McCloskey-Sharp, 26, was labelled a 'coward' on Friday by the sentencing judge for his part in a vicious and unprovoked attack against a group of defenceless party-goers on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula two years ago ... but he's likely to spend just 17 months behind bars.

David Cassai suffered a fractured skull in the attack by the three men and died hours later.

McCloskey-Sharp had pleaded guilty to punching Vasu Phillips, a friend of Mr Cassai's, in the head as he stood with his back turned, and was handed a maximum jail term of two years, three months.

Justice Elizabeth Hollingworth said David Cassai and his friends took a defensive position and were trying to defuse the situation and retreat when Dylan Closter and two of his friends, including Thomas Francis McCloskey-Sharp, attacked

He's the third person to face time in prison over the attack.

Victorian Supreme Court Justice Elizabeth Hollingworth said McCloskey-Sharp had committed a cowardly crime.

'You hit him after you had indicated that you were no threat to him,' she said.

'He would have had no idea what was coming and was therefore unable to defend himself in any way.

'It was a very cowardly act.'

She said the courts must send a message to the community that street violence will be punished with a prison term.

'Un-premeditated violence may be brief, but it can have profound and enduring consequences for all involved, as it has done in this instance.'

McCloskey-Sharp pleaded guilty to recklessly causing injury and affray. He must serve a minimum of 17 months in jail.

The man who fatally punched holidaymaker David Cassai and then danced over him like a boxer was  sentenced on Thursday to at least six years in prison. 

Dylan Closter was 18 when he roundhouse punched Mr Cassai. He suffered a fractured skull when his head struck the pavement, and died hours later.

Closter, now 20, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and affray in Cassai's killing. Justice Elizabeth Hollingworth sentenced him to nine years and three months in prison, with a non-parole period of six years.

Justice Hollingworth described how Mr Cassai and some friends were confronted by another group, which included Closter. Mr Cassai and his friends took a defensive position and were trying to defuse the situation and retreat when Closter and two of his friends attacked.

After Closter knocked Mr Cassai to the ground, he bounced on the balls of his feet in a boxing stance before fleeing.

As Closter's group fled, witnesses heard laughing and someone yelling out 'that's what we come here for', the Victorian Supreme Court heard.

David Cassai's mother Caterina Politi said the sentence highlighted the need for Victoria's mandatory 10-year minimum terms for one-punch deaths. Dylan Closter is in jail for a minimum six years and fellow attacker Thomas Francis McCloskey-Sharp will serve at least 17 months in prison

David Cassai was killed on new year's eve 2012 when attacked by Dylan Closter on the streets of Rye. In handing down sentence Justice Hollingworth told his assailant 'this was very much a one-sided attack, you started the affray and remained the principal aggressor throughout'

Justice Hollingworth said Closter handed himself into police out of pragmatism rather than remorse, given the number of witnesses and surveillance video and said that Closter initially claimed he was acting in self-defence.

'What happened that night was entirely of your making,' the judge told the accused.

'The affray involved a violent, frightening and completely unprovoked attack by you and members of your group on another group, in the middle of the night, on a public street, at a busy time of year.

'In the space of less than a minute, multiple punches had been thrown, one man was dead and five others were injured.'

'They just went out (to) celebrate a birthday and they just wanted to get home. They were ambushed and they had no chance' David Cassai's mother told reporters after his attacker Dylan Closter was jailed earlier this year for the 2012 assault

At the time, Mr Cassai's mother Caterina Politi said the sentence highlighted the need for Victoria's mandatory 10-year minimum terms for one-punch deaths.

'Six years minimum, it'll never be enough, but it doesn't send a message of deterrence and punishment for a man who took my son's life,' she said outside court.

'People waste their lives on the dole for five years and six years. Ten years is more significant.'

Ms Politi said her son and his friends posed no threat to anyone that night.

'They just went out (to) celebrate a birthday and they just wanted to get home. They were ambushed and they had no chance,' she said.

One of Cassai's friends, Tyrone Steven Russell, 23, from Perth, was jailed for 15 months with an eight-month minimum.

He pleaded guilty to recklessly causing injury, and affray, over the attack on Mr Cassai's friends.

'Six years minimum, it'll never be enough, but it doesn't send a message of deterrence and punishment for a man who took my son's life,' said David Cassai's mother Caterina Politi
