A Japanese soldier who refused to surrender after the Second World War ended and spent 29 years hiding in the jungle while continuing a guerilla war has died aged 91.

Hiroo Onoda remained on an island in the Philippines until 1974 because he did not believe the war was over.

He became the last Japanese soldier to surrender – but only after his former commander, who in 1945 had told him to stay behind and spy on American troops, was flown from Japan to order him to give up.

His extraordinary determination to 
carry on made Mr Onoda a hero in his homeland, although he was said to 
have killed 30 people while evading capture. His story was turned into a
 film and a book.

He had come out of hiding, erect but emaciated, on Lubang island on his 52nd birthday.

During
 his formal surrender to Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Mr Onoda
 saluted the Japanese flag and symbolically handed over his samurai 
sword while still wearing an army uniform that had been patched many 
times over.

His generation 
was taught absolute loyalty to Japan and its emperor. Soldiers in the 
Imperial Army observed a code that said death was preferable to 
surrender.

Mr Onoda, a 
lieutenant in army intelligence, had been sent to Lubang, 90 miles 
south-west of the Philippine capital Manila, in December 1944.

Most
 of his comrades surrendered when US troops landed on the island less 
than three months later but he refused to give up and remained in the 
jungle with three other soldiers.

He
 later recalled: ‘Every Japanese soldier was prepared for death, but as 
an intelligence officer I was ordered to conduct guerilla warfare and 
not to die.

‘I became an officer and I received an order. If I could not carry it out, I would feel shame. I am very competitive.’

At
 least four attempts were made to find him, during which family members 
appealed to him over loudspeakers and flights dropped leaflets urging 
him to surrender.

As he 
struggled to feed himself, Mr Onoda’s mission became one of survival. He
 stole rice and bananas from villagers, and shot their cows to make 
dried beef, triggering occasional skirmishes.

Three
 other soldiers were with him at the end of the war. One emerged from 
the jungle in 1950 and the other two died, one in a 1972 clash with 
local troops.

The turning 
point came on February 20, 1974, when Mr Onoda met a young globetrotter,
 Norio Suzuki, who had ventured to Lubang in pursuit of the veteran 
soldier.

Mr Suzuki quietly 
pitched camp in jungle clearings and waited. Mr Onoda eventually made 
contact with a simple ‘Oi’, and they began to talk.

Mr
 Suzuki returned to Japan and contacted the government, which called in 
the soldier’s superior, Major Yoshimi Taniguchi, to bring about a 
surrender.

The Philippine 
government pardoned Mr Onoda although many in Lubang never forgave him 
for the 30 people he killed during his campaign on the island.

Mr
 Onoda struggled to adapt to life on his return to Japan and he 
emigrated to Brazil in 1975 to become a farmer. He finally settled in 
his homeland in 1984 and opened nature camps for children.

He did not consider his 30 years in the jungle to have been a waste of time.

‘Without
 that experience, I wouldn’t have my life today’ he said. ‘I do 
everything twice as fast so I can make up for the 30 years. I wish 
someone could eat and sleep for me so I can work 24 hours a day.’
