A mother who was seriously injured in the horror coach crash that killed 39 people in Italy last month refused further treatment today until she sees her husband and two daughters... unaware they are all dead.

Clorinda del Giudice, 44, was on the bus with spouse Antonio and children Simona, 16, and Silvana, 22, when it careered into the guardrail of a flyover near the town of Avellino, and plummetted 100 feet into a ravine on June 28.

Heartrendingly, her refusal came hours after her daughter Simona lost her two-week fight for life today, making her the 39th fatality of the crash.

Hours before the fatal crash, Simona's sister, Silvana, posted happy pictures on Facebook, as the family
sat together on board the coach, at the beginning of a holiday weekend 
that ended in tragedy.

The elder sibling had only agreed to come on the trip at the last minute, having had a fight with her boyfriend.

Italian prosecutors are investigating
the owner of the vehicle and two people who work for the highway 
service company Autostrade for possible manslaughter after the crash, 
one of Europe's worst road accidents.

The 48 close-knit group of friends 
and relatives were almost all from the small seaside town of Pozzuoli, 
near Naples, and often took holidays together, organised by local salami
butcher Luciano Caiazzo, who also died in the collision.

The
blue-eyed sisters documented the whole trip, photographing the group, 
the family and each other, posting all the pictures on Facebook.

Then tragedy struck. Silvana and her father had been sitting, on Sunday night, at the front of the coach, the part that hit the ground first.

But in a horrific case of mistaken identity, their emotional grandfather, dazed by grief as he arrived at the makeshift morgue, mistook the body of Silvana for that of her younger sister, Italian media reported.

Simona’s name therefore wrongly appeared on some early lists of the dead.

Horrific: The crash happened on July 28. Here, rescuers wielding electric saws cut through metal looking for survivors inside the mangled bus, stopping occasionally in silence to listen for any cries for help

Carnage: Firefighters stand near the wreckage of the bus which plunged 30m (98ft) off a motorway into a ravine, killing at least 39 people

Macabre: Rescuers prepare the coffins of victims as the recovery operation continued through the night

Because of the mix-up, Silvana’s boyfriend arrived at the hospital that afternoon to make up with his lover, whom he believed was still alive, although badly injured.

Finding in the hospital bed instead, her younger sibling, who had the same blue eyes, he collapsed to the ground in tears, the Italian newspaper la Repubblica reported.

There was no one left but the grandfather to return to the morgue to re-identify Silvana.

Grief: People pay tribute to a coffin of one of the victims of a coach crash at the end of the funeral service at the Monteruscello Palasport near Pozzuoli July 30 - two days after the tragedy

Grief-stricken: Relatives gather around coffins in Moterusciello, Italy, during a mass funeral for the 39 victims

Heartbroken: Relatives are overcome with grief as they clutch the coffin of one of the victims of the crash which killed 28 members of one town alone

The poignant story emerged last week as families gathered in Pozzuoli to bury their dead after thousands of mourners packed into a sports hall for a mass funeral to commemorate the victims.

Prime Minister Enrico Letta joined an estimated 4,000 relatives, friends and dignitaries after calling a day of national mourning to mark one of the worst road accidents in the country's history.

Sobbing relatives clutched flower-draped coffins or collapsed into the arms of their loved ones ahead of the service this morning in Pozzuoli, a town in southern Italy which lost 28 members in the crash.
