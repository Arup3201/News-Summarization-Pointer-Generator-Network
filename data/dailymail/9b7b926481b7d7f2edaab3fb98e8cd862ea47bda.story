A single mum is desperately saving every cent to fly to the U.S. for her three-year-old daughter's ear to be reconstructed so she doesn't get bullied about the birth defect when she starts school.

You would never know to meet Autumn Byas, from Bass Hill in southwest Sydney, that she was born with a congenital deformity because her confidence and lust for life is oozing out of the energetic little girl.

The adorable little girl may only be able to hear from her left ear but that doesn't doesn't stop her great love for music and dancing. 

But her mother, Tanya Byas, has been on a mission since her daughter was born with microtia to get to California for Autumn to have an operation because she can't have surgery in Australia until she is 10 years old - in seven years' time.

Autumn loves music despite being deaf in her right ear

The condition, that affects about one baby in every 8,000-10,000 births, is treated differently in Australia with medical professionals using rib cartilage from the 10 year-old patient to recreate the ear, which takes six months to recreate.

However in America, the surgical technique uses a synthetic framework and the body’s own tissue to create an ear during the eight-hour operation, meaing there are no age restrictions.

'They will use her good ear as a template and make it out of synthetic material but make it a bit bigger because ears only grow a little bit so when she grows up they will be even and they use her membrane skin to cover it,' Tanya explained.

Autumn will also need a jaw reconstruction when she is about 12 or 13 years old.

After scrimping, saving and fundraising, Tanya has booked her daughter in for the operation on June 2 but she is $20,000 short with just 10 weeks to go. 

Although Autumn is deaf in her right ear, she speaks well and has no other health complications but her mother's worst fear is that she will be tormented when she starts school in two year's time for looking different.

'With school and bullying the way it is at the moment - life is hard enough,' Tanya Byas said.

'She is so outgoing and free-spirited - it doesn't hold her back - she just goes about everyday life and I don't want that to change.'

Paul Stanley from KISS was born with the same condition and was teased at school, and although it didn't stop the guitarist from succeeding in one of the most famous rock bands in the world, he still went ahead and had the reconstructive surgery in 1982 - almost a decade after the band formed.

'I read that he got called things like a "one-eared freak" when he was at school and I don't want Autumn to get called that,' she said. 

'As much as I can teach her to be strong - it would still be tough.'

Tanya's fear is that her daughter will be bullied when she starts school in another two years

A fundraiser is being held on Saturday to help with the last $20,000 needed for the $50,000 surgery

Life has been tough for Tanya, 39, who works full time as a sales coordinator, while her parents look after Autumn and has done without so she can put as much as she can towards her daughter's surgery.

When Autumn was one-year-old, Tanya held a fundraiser dinner which raised $17,000 and she has managed to save $13,000 of her own money.

She has also managed to pay for airfares and accommodation for the month-long trip.

'It's been hard because we can't do everyday things that people take for granted like going out to lunch or taking a trip,' she said.

'We went to the zoo last month but only because our friends had a free family pass.' 

But, Autumn still gets to do fun activities like any other kid such as swimming and dancing lessons which she relishes.

The condition, Microtia, affects about one baby in every 8,000-10,000 births

With still $20,000 to go, Tanya is holding another fundraiser dinner this Saturday in the hope to raise the last of the funds for the surgery. 

'I haven't even thought about what I will do if we don't raise the funds - I will have to get it from somewhere even if I get out a loan I guess,' she said.

'It will change Autumn's life immensely - it will give her a good start in life because no one will ever know.'

'She's such a performer so this will help her if she chooses that path in life.'
