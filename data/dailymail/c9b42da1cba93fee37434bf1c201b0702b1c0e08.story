On the field at least, this crushing Hibs victory represented a new low for Rangers and proof that the problems besetting this football team run a lot deeper than the identity of the manager.

Any hope that the placing of Ally McCoist on gardening leave might provoke a positive reaction was dissolved within 12 barnstorming minutes as Hibs grabbed control of the contest and rendered it an early walkover with strikes from David Gray and Jason Cummings.

This was Rangers’ heaviest domestic defeat since losing 6-2 in an Old Firm derby in 2000, a day on which a certain Alan Stubbs helped man the Celtic defence. Stubbs the manager spoke afterwards of Hibs’ near-perfect performance and, in Scott Allan, he possessed the game’s classiest performer.

Kenny McDowall acted as assistant throughout McCoist’s time in charge, but this was not so much a bruising introduction to the front line as a full-on torture session.

The caretaker manager looked shell-shocked as Rangers were taken apart by a side which started the day seven points poorer off in the Championship standings.

The irony is that nobody gained from this result so much as the league leaders, and Hearts’ procession to automatic promotion moved a step closer as Rangers fell further behind in the title race.

Even victory in next weekend’s Edinburgh derby is highly unlikely to provide Stubbs’ side with the opening to haul themselves back into the hunt but, having now chalked up three victories on the bounce, there is momentum at Easter Road.

And, having now beaten Rangers twice in the league handsomely, there is no reason for them to fear a play-off against the Glasgow club at the end of the season.

Easter Road has arguably proved Hibs’ biggest obstacle to keeping pace with neighbours Hearts at the top of the table. Still resentful of being relegated alongside the neighbours last term, the Leith crowd have been a cranky lot this season, affording little patience to Stubbs’ new-look side as they have bedded in.

Jason Cummings was in the right place at the right time to slot home Hibs' second of the afternoon

With Hibs entertaining Rangers for the first time since the latter’s financial meltdown in 2012, this was a top-tier standard occasion and the audience reflected the fact by backing their players to the hilt.

The ground was not full but it was noisy and Gray’s rocket soon boosted the decibel levels.

Although Rangers had not been here on league duty since a Nikica Jelavic double gave them a comfortable win in December 2011, they had visited the stadium for last term’s Challenge Cup Final, which ended in a humiliating defeat by Raith Rovers.

This was a different class of opposition but the shame was no less for it. The Hibs fans had already been warmed up by the sight of former Hearts midfielder Ian Black being bullied off the ball by Allan when Gray unleashed his piledriver.

A Liam Craig cross had been half-cleared by Lee McCulloch and Gray had time to take a touch as he stepped on to it 20 yards out.

The resulting shot was straight and true, arrowing high past Steve Simonsen at a fair pelt.

If that goal could just about be forgiven, Rangers’ defence was utterly incompetent at the second. Not only did Craig have the time and space to meet Dominique Malonga’s looping cross unopposed, his ball back across goal found Cummings in even more room in the six-yard box where he applied the simplest of finishes.

Cummings scored twice at Ibrox earlier in the season and he was again proving a constant menace, pulling Rangers’ defenders all over the place and showing no lack of confidence with the ball at his feet.

He attempted one of his zingers from 20 yards, forcing Simonsen to spill and, after Scott Robertson sent the rebound wide, Black’s embarrassment was completed as the No 8 was shown on the board to signal his withdrawal.

Already on a booking after a brainless challenge on Allan, the midfielder was saved from himself, if not the baying crowd, by McDowall, with Kyle Hutton being sent on in his place. There were just 33 minutes on the clock.

A cry of ‘sack the board’ went up from the away end and there was even some rare self-deprecation as they started to sarcastically cheer a succession of passes from the men in blue.

The break robbed Hibs of some momentum but they stood firm defensively with Liam Fontaine and Gray both putting their heads in the way of Nicky Law shots.

Kris Boyd had come on for Rangers at the break but the burly striker never looked like threatening.

Instead, Hibs were able to pick their guests off. Robertson got the third, swapping passes with Allan before sliding a low finish across Simonsen, and then Craig helped himself to the fourth.

It was again Allan with the assist, first bamboozling Hutton with a shimmy before driving forward and then scooping a pass into the path of Craig who, from a similar angle to Robertson, applied a subtle volleyed finish into the far corner.
