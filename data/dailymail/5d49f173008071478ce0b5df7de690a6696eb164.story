Feeling festive: Abbey Clancy has been unveiled as the face of Ultimo's festive lingerie collection and showcases the brand's new bras, which claim to boost the wearer's cup size by two

Crafted from vibrant red satin and finished  with embroidery and ribbon bows, the bra  promises to enhance your cleavage by two cup sizes.

Speaking about the range, Michelle Mone OBE, founder of Ultimo, said: 'There is no better way of enhancing your lingerie drawer than with a splash of colour - and this gorgeous new set is the perfect way to get into the festive spirit.

'Picking the right lingerie is as important as choosing the perfect party dress. It will ensure that you feel sexy and most importantly, comfortable and well supported. 

'Good lingerie creates the perfect foundation underneath any outfit and will make the world of difference to how you look and feel. Ultimo’s heritage is built on enhancing the female form, with a specific focus on cleavage boosting and uplift.'

Ironically, Abbey confessed to Grazia recently that she never wore a bra until she was 16.

She said: 'I only got my first bra when I was about 16 - I was still in thermal vests up until then, I was completely flat chested. Then all of a sudden I grew these humongous breasts.

'I've got a long relationship with underwear - I'd go so far as to say I've got a lingerie fetish. I think it's the first thing - the key thing - to make you feel good.' 

This ad campaign isn't the model's only coup in recent months- Abbey, 28, was also unveiled as the new face of Avon fragrance and invited her 53-year-old mother Karen to star alongside her.

The mother and daughter duo look more like sisters in the new promotional images for the fragrance, Cherish, which launches just in time for Mother's Day though. 

Referring to Karen shortly after the birth of her own daughter in 2011, Abbey said: 'I weigh less than I weighed before I had the baby and I'm really happy with my figure.

'I'm lucky to be blessed with good genes. My mum is 51 and hasn't had any work done, but still looks like she could be my sister. She's a goddess.'

The  range is available now from www.ultimo.co.uk priced at £30 for the bra and £14 for the matching briefs.
