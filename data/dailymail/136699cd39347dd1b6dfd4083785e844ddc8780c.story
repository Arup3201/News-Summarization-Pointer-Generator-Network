A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a body was found stuffed inside a plastic barrel that was dumped in front of Sonoma's city hall in California wine country, authorities said.

In custody: Christopher McNatt, 40, of Sonoma, was arrested Saturday on suspicion of murder

The blood-stained barrel was covered with a plastic tarp when it was discarded in front of the city hall on Friday at about 11.50pm.

The discovery of a dead man stuffed inside the 55-gallon barrel led detectives to a mobile home park, where Sonoma County Sheriff's detectives said they believed the victim, Ronald Sauvageau, 64, was killed.

They served a search warrant at a home inside the park and arrested Christopher McNatt, 40, in the slaying.

An autopsy will be conducted Tuesday to determine the cause of Sauvageau's death.

Sheriff's Sgt. Cecile Focha told the Santa Rosa Press Democrat that a weapon believed to be used in the killing was recovered, but she declined to elaborate on the type of weapon or the relationship between the two men.

'I can't speak to the motivations, but whoever decided to kill the person and bring his body there seems gruesome and disrespectful,' Focha said.

Scene: Late on Friday night, police were alerted to a a 55-gallon plastic barrel with dried blood on it, dumped outside Sonoma City Hall. Inside they found the dead body of a 64-year-old man

Trailer: Investigations lead police to a mobile home at the Acacia Grove Mobile Home Park on Highway 12 in Sonoma Valley, where detectives believe the crime took place. One of the recycling bins out front was missing

Investigation: Deputies determined which mobile home the victim was killed in at this park

Focha also refused to comment on whether the body was found whole or dismembered.

She said at least a half-dozen deputies with the Sheriff's Office and Sonoma Police Department are still investigating.

Deputies initially detained a second man Saturday in connection with the crime.

However he was let go without charge.

Focha also said that although the mobile home east of El Verano appeared to be the scene of the killing, she could not say where the two men were arrested

Ex: Dana Hamilton, a former girlfriend of suspect Christopher McNatt, was shocked about his arrest

'There's no danger to the public,' Focha said. 

'But no, I don't know if they're looking for other suspects.' 

McNatt was being held without bail pending a court appearance set for Tuesday. 

An ex-girlfriend of McNatt, Dana Hamilton, told ABC 7 News she was shocked about his arrest.

'There's no reason for this - he's not a violent person,' she said.

'It's so surreal, I'm just trying to catch my breath.'
