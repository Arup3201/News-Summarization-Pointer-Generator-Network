Roberto Soldado is compiling quite a DVD of video nasties and produced another horror show as Tottenham crashed out of Europe.

As he sprung the Fiorentina offside trap, Soldado had three choices: go round goalkeeper Neto and roll the ball into an empty net, shoot, or pass to Nacer Chadli to his left to leave the Moroccan with a tap-in. Any of those would have given Spurs the lead in the tie.

Instead, he chose secret option four, pass the ball straight at Neto in trying to find Chadli.

The look on Soldado’s face said it all. He wasn’t the only one as his team-mates tried to comprehend his decision. There was no open goal this time — but in many ways Thursday night’s gaffe was just as bad, if not worse.

Within 15 minutes, Soldado was trending on Twitter — above Madonna’s slip at the Brit Awards on Wednesday night. Had the striker done what a player worth £26million should, then Spurs might still be in the Europa League this morning. Instead, they head into Sunday’s Capital One Cup final against Chelsea on the back of this disappointing defeat.

However, Soldado shouldn’t shoulder all the blame for Thursday night’s defeat. Jan Vertonghen must also take his share of the flak.

Quite how the giant Belgian allowed the diminutive Mohamed Salah to outmuscle him in the box before firing Fiorentina into a 2-0 lead is a question Mauricio Pochettino — who didn’t look at Vertonghen when he was hauled off — will demand answers to.

Everyone, including Jose Mourinho, was looking for clues to Pochettino’s team selection ahead of Sunday’s Wembley showdown. And the Argentine, unlike his striker and centre half, didn’t disappoint. Harry Kane, Kyle Walker, Danny Rose and Ryan Mason were all left on the bench — a clear indication they will start at Wembley.

Nevertheless, this was a bold team selection by Pochettino. Imagine if Christian Eriksen had limped off?

The decision to start Eriksen was a risk but it nearly paid off inside 12 minutes when he fell in the box under Stefan Savic’s rash challenge. He appealed for a penalty but to no avail. However, replays showed he did have a case.

It was the talking point of a frenetic opening 20 minutes, which saw Eriksen, Milan Badelj and Claudio Pizarro all fail with long-range efforts.

Tottenham certainly weren’t overawed, looking to nullify Fiorentina’s away goal in the 1-1 draw at White Hart Lane from the outset.

And they would have had it in the 29th minute had it not been for Soldado’s ineptitude following Erik Lamela’s defence-splitting through-ball.

Pochettino was apoplectic in his technical area. ‘Why would a striker pass up an opportunity to score?’, he was probably asking himself. We’d all like an answer to that question, Mauricio. The night plummeted for Spurs from that moment.

Had Turkish referee Huseyin Gocek pointed to the spot when Fiorentina appealed for a penalty, claiming Federico Fazio had handled Gomez’s shot, then Spurs could easily have been behind by half-time.

By the 51st minute Tottenham’s bench was a man down after goalkeeping coach Toni Jimenez was sent to the dressing room after arguing with Gocek.

And three minutes later they were behind when Mario Gomez raced through one-on-one with Hugo Lloris after Badelj’s defence-splitting pass before coolly slotting home.

Lesson to Soldado: when you’re a striker in a one-on-one, you shoot.

Spurs would have been out of the tie had Lloris not thwarted Salah as he raced through on goal in the 61st minute. Pochettino sent for the cavalry, introducing Kane and Andros Townsend in search of an equaliser.

It didn’t work. Salah ended Tottenham’s Europa League campaign in the 71st minute, somehow firing past Lloris after Vertonghen’s mistake.

The Egyptian, on loan from Chelsea, flung his shirt off in celebration striking a psychological blow for his employers before the final.

Soldado will be lucky to have a shirt to wear at all on Sunday.

Was fatigue a factor? Spurs have now played 43 games this season, which is more than any other Premier League side. They will certainly be tired of hearing about one historical statistic that rumbles on – Tottenham have never progressed in European competition knockout rounds when they have failed to win the first leg at home.

This was a rare start for Micah Richards. In fact it was only his second since Fiorentina’s December 11. In the meantime, he has been an unused substitute eight times, come off the bench twice and had only one start. He is understood to want a move back to the Premier League, with Everton and West Ham keen. His Manchester City deal is up in the summer.

- Mohamed Salah just loves tormenting Tottenham and, indeed, any English side. The on-loan Chelsea attacker, who demolished Spurs in this competition in 2013 when he was a at Basle, scored Fiorentina’s second here and was man of the match. He has now scored five in this competition and all five have been against English sides (three against Chelsea and two against Spurs).
