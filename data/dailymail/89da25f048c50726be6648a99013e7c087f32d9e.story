Two men in their early 20's have been pulled unconscious from the water near rocks in Palm Beach on Sydney's Northern beaches.

At around 2pm on Thursday emergency crew responded to reports that two people had been swept into the ocean from Palm Beach, approximately 40 kilometers outside of Sydney's CBD.

'It's a bit sketchy, we don't know exactly how they ended up in the water, whether they jumped in or were swept in there by the water,' said Kate MacDonald, President of Palm Beach's Surf Life Saving Club.

'All we know is that neither of them could swim,' she said.

The surf life saving club responded to the two men, who are of Indian appearance, and pulled them from the water onto the club's inflatable rescue boats.

The men, who may be tourists, were both semi-conscious and had laboured breathing.

'They were very close to death, and we did everything we needed to do from our end,' said Ms MacDonald.  

Emergency services responded to the report and at least one of the men has been airlifted to hospital, with the other possibly transported in an ambulance.

'This is what we're here to do. From our perspective everything went well,' said Ms McDonald.

'The guys have been congratulated by NSW Ambulance for the work they did.' 

Palm Beach is the northernmost stretch of sand in Sydney, and is a popular tourist district.

The incident follows the death of a man believed to be in his 60's at The Entrance North, on NSW Central Coast.

At about 1.45pm on Thursday police and emergency services were called to a beach on Bondi Road, following reports that a man had been pulled from the water.

Ambulance Paramedics treated the man, but were unable to revive him and he died at the scene. 

He is yet to be formally identified.

Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding his death and a report will be prepared for the information of the Coroner.  

'New Years Day is always a big one, especially if it's a hot one like today,' said Ms MacDonald.

'We get all walks of life and nationalities and swimming abilities, so for anyone heading out tonight, first and foremost swim between the flags,' she said.

'The ocean is a scary beast, and lifesavers have the best eyes.'

For parents, Ms MacDonald advises a close eye be kept on children as 'they will tend to just want to jump in the water when it's hot'.
