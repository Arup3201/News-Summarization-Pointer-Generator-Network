Stoke City manager Mark Hughes has hit out at the Senegalese national team over their handling of summer signing Mame Biram Diouf.

Hughes has joined a long list of Premier League managers who have had to change their selection plans for this weekend's fixtures as their players have returned from the international break with injury knocks.

Diouf, who netted Stoke's winner against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium before joining up with Senegal, had to complete the majority of a 12,000-mile round trip in economy class before eventually touching back down in Manchester on Friday afternoon.

Hughes has stated he might have to have more of a say on how Diouf, who scored in Senegal's 2-0 win against Egypt on Friday, travels to and from Africa.

The Stoke boss said: 'He realised quite late on he was down as an economy ticket and tried to change it.

'In the end, I don't think he was able to get on business class, going out, and I don't think there were any tickets left.

'It's something we maybe need to look at to make sure we have an input because it compromises the players if they don't travel right coming home and I think the complete journey was 12,000 miles.

'He flew in from Paris to Manchester - so I assume there was a flight from Johannesburg and one from Botswana.

'You don't get any information, which is disappointing - that should be a prerisquite.'

Stoke's medical team will make a late check on Diouf to determine if he can feature against Leicester City.
