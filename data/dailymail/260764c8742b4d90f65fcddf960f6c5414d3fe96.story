Winner: Jo Wheatley, who won the Great British Bake Off, told producers of the show that her husband was in jail

The programme was billed as a  celebration of all things homely.

But the truth about the life of this year’s Great British Bake Off winner is a far cry from the cosy domestic bliss viewers of the BBC2 series might expect.

While mother-of-three Jo Wheatley’s wholesome cooking won her first place, it has now emerged that the 42-year-old Essex housewife is married to a professional gambler who is serving a lengthy prison sentence for his part in a £60million money-laundering racket.

The Great British Bake Off was the surprise hit of the BBC’s autumn schedule, with its cookery book going straight to number one in the non-fiction chart.

However, what the BBC did not tell either the show’s two judges or its  four million viewers was that Mrs Wheatley’s husband was jailed for seven years for conspiracy with others to conceal, convert and transfer the proceeds of crime.

Richard Wheatley, 44, who is known as ‘The Bear’ on the international gambling circuit, pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court in April last year after £60million – allegedly the proceeds from drug trafficking – was laundered through a money exchange.

The couple’s sons – Billy, 24, Jesse, 21, and Dylan, 16 – were interviewed for the programme at home, playing cricket in the garden and enjoying a happy tea party to celebrate their mother’s win. Yet there was no mention of their father, who will be eligible for release in two years.

Even the show’s judges, cooks Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood, did not know about Wheatley’s prison sentence until after the end of the series, in which they were won over by Mrs Wheatley’s ‘sublime’ cupcakes and ‘outstandingly delicious’ limoncello and white chocolate croquembouche.

In one of the only interviews given since the show’s final on October 4, Mrs Wheatley admitted that her husband had a conviction for ‘fraud’ and added: ‘I was honest with the producers from the start but I didn’t want it to define me.

‘I didn’t want to use it as some  X Factor-style sob story.’

Criminal: Richard Wheatley, husband of bake off winner Jo Wheatley, is a poker player known as 'The Bear' . He is now in jail over a £60m money laundering racket

Kept in the dark: Great British Bake Off judge Mary Berry was not told about Richard Wheatley's conviction until after the final

Asked if she would stand by her husband, she said: ‘Of course. I’ve known him since I was 15 and I love him.’

She said she ‘just wanted to do 
something for myself’ and now hopes to set up a cookery school as a 
means of supporting her family.

Mrs Wheatley, who lives in a £500,000 
farmhouse in Ongar, Essex, already has a popular blog – Jo’s Blue Aga – 
and has set up a series of cookery workshops. A book deal is said to be 
in the offing. Her husband, meanwhile, lists his hobbies as urban art 
and golf on his professional poker profile and boasts on Twitter of 
dining at The Ivy and taking gambling holidays in Monaco.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Joanne Wheatley’s husband’s background bears no relevance to the programme.

‘She does not have a criminal conviction and was selected in the same way as the other contributors who appeared.

‘She is a talented baker and those talents have been recognised.’
