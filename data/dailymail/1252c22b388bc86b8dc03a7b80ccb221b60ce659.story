Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers has broken her own record by having the most children while in office.

The 44-year-old Republican welcomed her third child into the world on Sunday, announcing the birth of her daughter Brynn Catherine on Instagram two days later.

'Nothing compares to the miracle of bringing a new life into the world. She's beautiful and seems to be taking it all in stride. Our hearts are full,' she wrote as a caption to the picture of her holding her newborn.

New family member: Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers gave birth to Brynn Catherine on Sunday and posted this photo to her public Instagram account two days later

She was elected to Congress in 2004 and represents the eastern district of Washington state that encompasses Spokane.

Mrs Rodgers married her husband Brian in August 2006 and eight months later, she had their first child, a son named Cole.

After Cole's birth, the couple revealed that he had been diagnosed with Down Syndrome and she has been an advocate for special needs advocacy and launched the Congressional Down Syndrome Caucus a month after Cole was born.

'Every parent has hopes and dreams for their child, Down Syndrome is not on the list,' she said in an interview with regional magazine Northwest Woman posted on her Congressional website.

Growing brood: The 44-year-old Congresswoman has two other children- her son Cole and daughter Grace- with her husband Brian and is currently in her fourth term representing Washington's 5th district

'It is not what we expected, yet we have embraced Cole as the special gift from God that he is. We are developing new dreams for our son and other children with Down Syndrome.'

She gave birth to her second child Grace more than two years later in December 2010 and now Brynn Catherine is the latest addition to the growing family.

Each of the children were 'record breakers' in a way, because Mrs McMorris Rodgers became the first member of Congress in more than a decade to give birth while in office when she had Cole.

Grace then set her over another edge by making her the first Congresswoman to give birth twice while in office, and now Brynn has set the bar even higher.

She appears to have stayed active at work until the very last minute, putting out a press release about the passage of a gas pipeline reform act on Thursday which was the last day Congress was in session before the Thanksgiving break.

They will not return to the chambers until Monday December 2 and they will have two four-day weeks before taking off for the Christmas holidays.

Calls to the Congresswoman's office about the expected length of her maternity leave were not immediately returned.
