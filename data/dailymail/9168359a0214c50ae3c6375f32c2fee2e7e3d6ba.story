Many women will admit that they have been dreaming of the perfect fairytale wedding since they were little girls.

But
some, it seems, are so enamoured by the idea, that they have even gone so far as to purchase any wedding related products they can get their hands on.

According to the latest research, 11 per cent of single women in the UK have already picked out their wedding dress.And of these keen women, an additional 37 per cent have even gone as far to already purchase a gown, with no proposal on the horizon.

Now THAT's keen! One in 10 single British women have already chosen their wedding dress, even though they don't even have a partner yet

And it isn't just the perfect dress that avid brides-to-be are dreaming up.

59 per cent have already planned other elements of their big day, such as make-up, bridesmaids and a venue, despite not having any immediate plans to marry.

And only 41 per cent of respondents who had planned 
elements of their wedding day admitted that they had told a prospective 
partner about their plans, whilst 36 per cent claimed that their wedding plans 
had scared members of the opposite sex in the past.

Furthermore, a canny 34 per cent of respondents 
admitted that they had already started saving towards their wedding; 76 per cent
of which claimed that they already had a budget in mind.

Keen: Of these keen women who have already chosen a wedding dress, an additional 37 per cent have even gone as far to already purchase it

A spokesman for MyVoucherCodes, who carried out the survey, said: 'Whilst I have heard of people who have 
had some ideas about their wedding day, I have never heard of any who 
have purchased a wedding dress despite no plans to get married in the 
near future; but it seems that the majority who have keep it a secret, 
so this is probably why!

'Whilst it is good forward planning, parting 
with a lot of money for something you don’t need there and then is never
advised- particularly as you might change your mind when the big day 
comes around.

'Planning a wedding can be expensive and if you do not have
to spend the money right away, what is the rush?

'The best bet is to 
wait until you have decided what type of wedding day you and your 
prospective partner would like to have.'

Pippa Vosper, wedding style consultant for TheWeddingEditor.com, added: 'I think if you know what suits your body shape and you fall in love with a wedding dress on first site, it's quite safe to assume you will still love the dress when your wedding day arrives.

'I have brides who want me to work on their dress selection with them over a year before the big day and only once has the bride not gone with her original choice.

'When you know you know!'
