Alan Pardew believes Joey Barton could follow him with a career in the dugout – but admits he won’t go away quietly whatever he does.

The 32-year-old returns to St James’ Park for the first time on Saturday after leaving for Queens Park Rangers three years ago.

Barton has since been critical of the ownership and hierarchy at the club but remains in contact with his old boss.

And Pardew says he was amused rather than agitated by the midfielder’s forthright views on every subject.

‘If you work with Joey he has got an opinion on everything and he likes to express that,’ revealed Pardew.

‘He always made me laugh, or made me think. I didn't 100 per cent categorically disagree with him, but he has an opinion and you have got to admire that and I really enjoyed working with him - I had a great relationship with him.’

As for the future?

‘Joey isn't going to go away quietly,’ admits Pardew. ‘I am sure he has got a plan and I think he could go down (the management route).

‘But I think he gets overlooked for what a good player he is. In terms of his tweeting and everything else he does, none of that bothers me, it is what he does on the pitch that matters and he does it very well.’

Barton returned to action following injury during QPR’s 2-2 draw with Manchester City earlier this month. That point took Harry Redknapp’s side to within one of safety, but their record on the road remains played five, lost five.

Pardew, though, is confident that his opposite number will emerge from the drop zone he himself populated until four wins on the spin.

‘Harry’s CV and reputation speak for themselves – he’s been there and done it. He knows that his team is playing well,’ said the United manager.

‘When I was under a difficult spell, just before the big disappointment at Southampton (4-0 defeat), we were terrific but didn’t win a game.

‘I think that’s where QPR are. They are better than the position they are in and we’ll see that.

‘We won’t be surprised to get a tough game. I think there will be goals, hopefully we’ll get one more than them.

‘But I always enjoy Harry’s teams. They play to win, like my teams, and are always on the front foot with flair.’

Newcastle, meanwhile, could enter the top four with a sixth straight victory in all competitions.

It was back in 2012 that the Magpies finished fifth, although Pardew feels this team is more about pace on the break compared to the domination of that vintage.

‘This is a different squad and it has not got the experience of that team,’ he said.

‘Possession was the key to that team and this is slightly different. We can still win games, but we do not control the game in terms of possession.

‘Instead, we have some real assets in the team in terms of pace and exuberance.’
