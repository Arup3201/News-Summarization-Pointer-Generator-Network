A 30-year-old New York State school bus driver was killed on Tuesday morning after suffering a suspected heart attack behind the wheel.

Authorities say that Edwin Rivera DeJesus was driving towards Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. School No. 9 in Rochester at around 7am when the medical issue caused him to sideswipe another vehicle and hit a tree.

He was pronounced dead at the scene. All of the eight students traveling with DeJesus and a female adult supervisor were taken to Strong Memorial Hospital with some suffering serious but not life-threatening injuries.

As of 2pm six of the eight children, ranging from eight to 11 years old, had been discharged and allowed to return home.

The students in the other bus DeJesus hit were not hurt. 

Noe Gonzalez, an early morning commuter who stopped to investigate the crash scene, told Time Warner Cable News he heard children screaming before spotting the unresponsive driver.

He helped the passengers exit the bus by opening the emergency exit. The front end of the bus had been crushed with the front doors locked shut.

Another eye witness said: 'I called the police and said, "get here, get here, get here." It was just crazy, it was scary.'

DeJesus had worked with Monroe School Transportation since 2010 and was said to be 'well-liked'. 

He apparently had no prior medical conditions and had even recently passed a physical examination.

David Bonacchi, vice president of the bus company, said early indicators suggest the driver suffered a 'massive heart attack.'

Police are currently investigating the incident.
