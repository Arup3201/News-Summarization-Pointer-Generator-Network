The mystery of the Madonna figure which glowed in the dark, attracting thousands of pilgrims to a sleepy Belgian village, has been solved - and it's not a miracle.

A team of scientists from the science faculty at Liege 
university discovered the Madonna was glowing in the dark because it had been covered with paint containing zinc sulphide on an unknown date.

Dr Rudi 
Cloots, who led the university team said: 'This chemical has a luminous effect and 
is the reason for the strange light. It's no miracle.'

Mystery solved: Scientists found that the statue was covered in paint containing zinc sulphide which made it glow

But he could not explain why it took 15 years before the glow appeared.

After the statue was discovered in mid-January, police had to control crowds in 
the village of Jalhay, near Liege who were eager to touch the figure which 
suddenly began to glow in the kitchen of an elderly 
couple's home.

Over 500 people visited the house in one day, eager to pay homage to it.

Four 
visitors claimed they had been cured of physical disabilities after 
being in the presence of the Madonna and the Bishop of Liege sent church
 officials to investigate the phenomenon.

The
 statue, which is about a foot high, represents the 'Virgin of Banneux',
 from the name of a nearby village where a young girl was said to have 
witnessed an appearance by the Virgin in 1933.

The
 town is a pilgrim destination in largely Catholic 
Belgium, although Catholic authorities from the Banneux sanctuary also expressed caution about the 'glowing' Virgin.

The glowing Madonna will now be moved to a local church so pilgrims can continue to see it.
