A chemical usually associated with how happy we feel could also play a pivotal role in our sexual preferences, researchers have discovered.

A Chinese team found that blocking serotonin, known as the brain's 'happy chemical' caused female mice to switch their sexual preferences.

It is the first time that sexual preference has been reversed in animals without sex hormones.

Researchers found that when they blocked the serotonin receptors in female mice, their sexual preferences switched and they tried to mount other females

Serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine, is a  neurotransmitter - a chemical substance that transmits nerve impulses across the space between nerve cells or neurons.

It plays an important part in the regulation of learning, mood, sleep and helps control blood vessels.

It has also been linked to anxiety, migraine, vomiting and appetite.

Yi Rao of Peking University in 
Beijing, China, and his colleagues genetically engineered female mice so
that they could no longer make or respond to serotonin.

'Female mouse mutants lacking either 
central serotonergic neurons or serotonin prefer female over male 
genital odors when given a choice, and displayed increased female–female
mounting when presented either with a choice of a male and a female 
target or only with a female target,' the team wrote in their paper,  
which is published in the journal PNAS.

Although the research was carried out in mice, serotonin works in the same way in human brains

'Our results indicate that serotonin controls sexual preference,' they say.

'It's possible that the well-known 
effect of early sex hormone levels on partner preference and the 
serotonin mechanism described here are completely independent 
mechanisms,' Simon LeVay of Stanford University told New Scientist.

'In other words, serotonin systems 
may be part of the cascade of signals that translate sex hormone levels 
during development into sexual partner preference in adulthood.'
