Play was suspended in the first round of the KLM Open on Thursday when Paraguay's Fabrizio Zanotti was hit on the head by a golf ball from a wayward shot by Alexandre Kaleka.

Zanotti, who won the BMW International Open earlier this season, was on the 16th fairway when he was injured by a ball struck from the 14th tee.

The 31-year-old received treatment on the course and was then taken to hospital.

Zanotti had started his round from the 10th at Kennemer Golf Club and was level par after six holes.

He was partnering Hennie Otto and Brooks Koepka while Kaleka was out with James Kingston and Richard Bland.

The European Tour confirmed that Zanotti was on his way to hospital to be assessed further but that he was ok, with tournament director Miguel Vidaor later adding: 'The latest report from hospital is that all neurological tests have come back clear. We wish Fabrizio a speedy recovery.'

Zanotti has since took to Twitter to thank people for their messages of support to him following the incident, confirming he has been discharged from hospital and will now take a couple of weeks out to fully recover.
