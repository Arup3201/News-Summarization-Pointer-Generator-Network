A group called DoSomething.org has launched a website where students can post photos of the most unappetizing lunch offerings from their schools.

It is called Fed Up and, like all projects taken on by the non-profit, it aims to empower young people to make positive changes in the world.

Along with the pictures, grossed out teens can vent their frustration with sarcastic captions that sum up just what makes each dish so unpalatable.

Brain food? A new website allows school kids nationwide to upload photos of their most unappetizing school lunches. This gruel was uploaded by a student at Jubilee Academy in Texas

Mission: The site was started by DoSomething.org, a non-profit dedicated to empowering young people to make positive changes in the world

Those who visit the blog-style site can approve of, or condemn each photo via Eat It or Toss It buttons.

According to Farah Sheikh, who runs Fed Up, the idea for the project came from a study that sought to understand why students drop out of school.

‘The obvious reasons, like bad grades and needing to support their families with a job, came up,’ Sheikh told Today. ‘But we started realizing that nutrition in school plays a huge role in ability to perform. Have you ever eaten a fried food lunch and felt the effects afterwards? For some students, they have no choice but to feel that way after a meal.’

Unappetizing: Many examples, like this lunch from Dearborn High School in Dearborn, Michigan with what appears to be pizza, are downright disgusting

Tossing your lunch: The site allows users to upload photos like these, and also to vote each photo as Eat It or Toss It

Tasty! The uploader of this photo from Cherokee High School in Georgia noted the light seasoning of human hair atop what may or may not be pizza

Quippy: Many of the uploads come with sarcastic, though occasionally flattering, remarks about the food items from the students

Salty: Part of the USDA's Healthy, Hunger-Free kids initiative stipulates that high school lunches must contain less than 740 milligrams of sodium

Fatty: The USDA also stipulates that school lunches contain less fat than they once could

Fed Up has received thousands of submissions in the week or so since it launched. And the photos have received a combined 30,000 votes.

‘We've learned that young people care,’ Sheikh says. ‘They want to see change, and up until now haven't known how to voice their opinions.’

Users will be able to post photos and vote through November 15.

Once voting closes, DoSomething.org will compile the data and create infographic maps that show where the best and worst lunches in America are served.

The funny captions hide a bitter truth about American school lunches. Despite new legislation aimed at making them healthier, around two thirds of American school lunches exceed recommended fat content and most exceed recommended sodium content

Healthier: The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 established new standards for all foods sold in schools with an emphasis on more veggies and fewer calories

WHAT'S BEING DONE

In 2010, the USDA instituted the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. The initiative is a pet project of first lady Michelle Obama, who has made childhood obesity her signature issue.

The new regulations have a calorie cap and require that school meals include only one portion of meat or protein. They also stipulate that milk be either skim or one percent fat and that bread be ‘brown wheat.’

In an effort to curb obesity, carbohydrates like French fries may only be served in three-fourths of a cup portions and kids in elementary school—where the complaints mostly seem to originate—may only be served a total of 650 calories per meal.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

The government estimates that
around two thirds of school meals exceed the fat content limits. Most 
lunches are believed to exceed the sodium limits.

Meanwhile, some 21 million students relied on school lunches as their primary meal of the day last year.

And at least a third of American children and adolescents are overweight or obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

Farah Sheikh, who heads up Fed Up, fears that American students are losing out in part because of fattening school lunches.

Hopeful: Sheikh hopes the Fed Up project will help improve school performance and alleviate the childhood obesity epidemic

Bot all bad: Not all of the photos are uploaded by students angry at the quality of their school lunches. Some actually praise them, though the majority of votes are likely of the negative variety

Useful: Fed Up intends to take data it collects from the site and turn it into an infographic handout for schools and nutritionists
