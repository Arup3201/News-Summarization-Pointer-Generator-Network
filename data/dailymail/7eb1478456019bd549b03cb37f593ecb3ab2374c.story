The Prince of Wales ready to be crowned King of Spain is how Gareth Bale’s appearance in Wednesday night’s Copa del Rey final has been billed.

He is yet to score in the cup in four brief appearances but his 19 goals in all other competitions have left Madrid fans convinced he will step up in the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo.

So far this season he has delivered without Ronaldo – half of his 14 league goals have been scored when his Portuguese team-mate has not been in the side – but games in Spain don’t come much bigger than Clasico cup finals and Diario AS on Wednesday morning referred to this match as ‘the game of his life’.

Glory days ahead: Bale could win his first piece of silverware at Real Madrid

Bale has been in Ronaldo’s shadow for most of his first season.

His worst moment of form and fitness came at the end of last year and he benefited from the Madrid obsession with Ronaldo winning the Ballon d’Or.

His blip would have made far more headlines had Ronaldo not been on the brink of being crowned World Player of the Year.

Bale is the first galactico spared the intense first season spotlight because it has remained on Ronald, but on Wednesday night the lights will all be on him as Real try to win the Cup for the first time since 2011.

Then, it was Ronaldo who got the only goal in an extra-time 1-0 win.

Bale has impressed his team-mates this season with some super-human goals.

The run from the half-way line against Rayo Vallecano and the perfectly executed first time shot that he squeezed into the corner from 30 yards out against Real Sociedad.

But team-mates have also remarked on how detached he remains in the dressing room.

It’s a coldness born of not speaking the language; of still adapting to the club that is like no other in the world; but also of a steely determination to succeed.

Bale has kept the blinkers on and his team-mates believe that will serve him well as the season heads into the home straight.

When others have been affected by the ever-changing moods of the Bernabeu, Bale has remained completely untouched by both the abuse and the adulation.

He has gained the reputation of a man moved only by his own numbers – 15 assists and 19 goals is an incredible first season return.

He needs to get his first goal against Barcelona and more importantly, bag his first trophy.

Barcelona boss Tata Martino believes be criticised even if his side beat Real on Wednesday night.

'When I arrived in Barcelona, people were saying I wouldn’t be eating Christmas pudding here,' said the Argentine. 'But now I’m getting ready to eat a nice Easter egg.

'Whatever happens, the analysis of my performance will not be positive. That’s the price you pay for being here.'
