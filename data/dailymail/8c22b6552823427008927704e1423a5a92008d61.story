The trailer park babysitter who allegedly bludgeoned a nine-year-old girl to death before wrapping her body in bin bags, putting it in his freezer and dismembering it was today charged with murder.

Michael Plumadore, 39, of Fort Wayne, Indiana, told police he 'killed Aliahna Maroney-Lemmon', who weighed just 41lbs, in the early hours of last Thursday before she was reported missing the next day.

He had been looking after the girl and her two younger sisters because their mother was ill. He had cared for Aliahna's dying grandfather and her family saw him as a trusted friend and neighbour.

Plumadore is jailed without bond and the charges will be read to him in prison. A court hearing on his three charges is scheduled for next Wednesday and he could face the death penalty if convicted.

The murder jail sentence in Indiana is up to 65 years. He is also charged with abuse of a corpse and removing a dead body from the scene, which each carry maximum jail terms of three years.

Plumadore told police he hit the girl in the head with a brick. He then allegedly put the girl's body inside bin bags and stuffed it inside a freezer in the trailer where he had lived with her grandfather.

He told authorities he later used a hacksaw to dismember her body. Police arrested him on Monday, two days after more than 100 emergency workers searched where he and Aliahna's family lived.

Police said Plumadore told them he had hidden Aliahna's head, feet and hands at the rundown trailer park and discarded her other remains at a business nearby.

Authorities obtained a warrant to search the trailer on Monday and found the body parts then. He has previously been convicted of trespassing, assault and forgery in three different states.

The girlâ€™s tearful mother Tarah Souders was seen clenching a fist near her mouth at a candlelight vigil held for the little girl in Fort Wayne on Tuesday night.

It also emerged this week that there was a warrant out for Plumadore's arrest 11 years before the murder. He was charged with battery of a first-responder in 2000 and was given felony probation.

But he failed to report to his probation officer, fulfil his community service hours or complete an anger management course. Plumadore was reported an absconder in June 2000.

Greg Shumaker, one of 15 convicted sex offenders who lives at the park, recalled Aliahna's family moving to the trailer park to help take care of 66-year-old James E 'Shorty' Lemmon.

Frightening: According to a state website, 15 registered sex offenders live at the mobile home park that numbers about two dozen homes

Sadness: Tarah Souders, mother of Aliahna, is pushed in a wheelchair by step-grandfather David Story and reacts in front of a memorial outside of a mobile home next to Michael Plumadore's residence on Tuesday

He was also a convicted sex offender and died on December 3. Mr Shumaker said Aliahna's grandfather Mr Lemmon was 'getting old' and 'had trouble breathing.'

Convicted: James Lemmon, Aliahna's grandfather, was convicted of child molesting

Mr Shumaker said he introduced Plumadore
to Mr Lemmon shortly after Plumadore moved into the trailer park, and 
Plumadore moved in with Mr Lemmon a few days later.

Mr Shumaker said he knew Mr Lemmon because they were both sex offenders and were in jail together. Plumadore is not a registered sex offender in Indiana.

But Mr Lemmon had assured Ms Souders that there was nothing to worry about, Mr Shumaker said.

Paulette Hair, 45, a former manager at the trailer park who lives at a nearby trailer park, said she also knew Mr Lemmon was a sex offender. 'He stayed out of everybody's way,' she said.

Mr Shumaker said Plumadore briefly moved away, but returned when Ms Souders, 28, asked him to care for her father.

Aliahna's
father, Dawayne Maroney of Centerville, Iowa, said he knew Plumadore 
through Ms Souders and had no reason to distrust him.

'I
can't talk about it because I'm still coping with it. It's too hard to 
talk about,' he said. 'I had no reason to suspect anything.'

Mr Maroney said he hadn't recently talked with his daughter or her mother, because they frequently changed their phone number.
