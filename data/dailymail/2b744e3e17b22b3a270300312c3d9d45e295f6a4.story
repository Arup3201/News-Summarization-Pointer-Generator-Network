Yaya Toure hit back on Tuesday after he was subjected to more racist abuse in the build-up to Manchester City’s crucial Champions League clash with CSKA Moscow.

Toure was targeted on Twitter just hours after reactivating his account on Monday following a five-month break from social media, and yesterday described the abuse as ‘a disgrace’.

Anti-racism group Kick It Out reported it to Greater Manchester Police who confirmed that they have launched an investigation.

City boss Manuel Pellegrini insisted that the issue will have no bearing on Toure’s participation in Wednesday's Group E tie against CSKA at the Etihad. The two teams were forced to play behind closed doors in Moscow two weeks ago due to UEFA sanctions against the Russian club dating back to the racist taunts aimed at Toure by their supporters in last season’s competition.

The Ivory Coast star responded to the latest abuse, saying: ‘For me, it’s a disgrace to be honest. We need to do something to try to tell people those kinds of behaviour have to stop.

‘I want those people to understand what they’re doing is wrong. I’ve been attacked like that for many years. I will never stop telling them they are wrong and have to change.

‘To have such aggression in sport, I can’t understand that. That’s why I’ve been trying to fight it. Football doesn’t have a colour. We’re just people from all over the world trying to enjoy the game. I never see this in rugby, I never see that in tennis or anything else. I don’t know where it’s coming from.’

Pellegrini denied that the controversy could be a distraction for Toure as City attempt to revive their flagging European campaign.

‘Yaya is an experienced player,’ he said. ‘He is always trying to fight against those things but I don’t think he will have any problem about that, to play in the way he knows.’

Pellegrini believes that despite having picked up just two points from the opening three group games, City can still turn Champions League gloom into glory this season by joining the list of clubs who recovered from a poor qualifying campaign to be crowned kings of Europe.

The Premier League champions will have 11 points if they win their remaining three games against CSKA, Bayern Munich and Roma, although even that is only likely to guarantee second place.

Jose Mourinho led FC Porto to Champions League triumph from a similar position in 2003-04, and did the same with Inter Milan six years later despite winning only nine points from the group stage. Liverpool embarked on the road to Istanbul after finishing group runners-up with 10 points.

‘This is a very important game but it’s not a death match because until mathematics can’t fix it, you can continue,’ said Pellegrini. ‘There are teams who qualified with few points and then after that they won the Champions League.

‘It is impossible to be sure but I think this group will be decided in the last game in Italy against Roma.’

After playing to 8,000 empty seats against the Italians in their last home game and then an empty stadium in Moscow, City have declared tonight’s tie a 46,000 sellout on the back of a two-for-one ticket offer.

However, they will be without defender Aleksandar Kolarov who has been ruled out for a month with the calf injury he suffered in the warm-up for Sunday’s Manchester derby.
