Former 'Saturday Night Live' cast member Victoria Jackson has filed to run as an independent candidate for a seat on a county commission outside Nashville, Tenn.

Jackson calls herself a tea party conservative.

Though she has spent her political life up until now as a registered Republican, she believes the party has lost its way.

Second act: Former SNL star Victoria Jackson wants to run for a Tennessee county commission seat as a 'tea party conservative'

Funny girl: Jackson was once better known as an SNL player working with comedy legends like Jane Curtin, Chevy Chase, Lorne Michaels, and Dana Carvey

Jackson, 54, told The Tennessean she filed as an independent candidate because she was 'very disappointed with the Republican Party.'

'But I just can’t do it anymore; they just don’t have the values of our founding fathers anymore,' she said. 'I am sure there are a few Republicans who do. I want less federal government involvement, lower taxes, smaller government, more public involvement, a balanced budget and fiscal responsibility.'

As long as Jackson meets the candidate qualifying requirements by the Feb. 20 deadline, her name will be on the county general election ballot on Aug. 7.

Should she make it that far, she'll run against the Republican nominee, who will be chosen in May.

There are currently five Republicans who have gotten petitions for the District 2 seat Jackson is gunning for.

The comedian's legal name is Victoria Lynn Jackson-Wessel, but she asked county officials if her name could appear on the ballot as simply Victoria Jackson because 'people thought it said weasel,' said deputy administrator Chad Gray.

Controversy: No stranger to heated debate, Jackson has called television shows featuring gays 'sickening' and protested Muslim centers

Jackson promised not to be a traditional candidate if she qualifies for the ballot, relying on 'word of mouth' rather than actively fundraising, and possibly buying campaign stickers and shirts with her own money.

Though once known for her parts in popular skits like 'Toonces the Driving Cat' and appearances on Weekend Update, in more recent years Jackson has been in the public eye as an outspoken Tea Party activist and conservative Christian.

In 2011 she sparked controversy when she blasted television show Glee for airing a same-sex kiss between two male actors, calling the program 'sickening' and 'a mockery of Christians.'

Golden years: Seen here with fellow SNL alum Jon Lovitz, Jackson was known for her squeaky-voiced late night persona

'I think the key to saving America is normal everyday citizens getting involved because we the people are supposed to be in control, not the government,' Jackson said. 'I had a political awakening in 2007. I'm tired of complaining. I want to do something.'

Upon arriving in Tennessee, Jackson continued to speak out against cultures and lifestyles she believes threaten the country, including protesting a public discussion hosted by the American Muslim Advisory Council and working to stop a mosque from opening in Murfreesboro.

Jackson moved to Tennessee last year
 with husband Paul Wessel, a retired helicopter pilot with 35 years 
experience with the Miami Police Department.

'I think I will fit in quite easily with (the current county commission),' she said. 'I went to the dentist recently and there was a Bible in the lobby of the dentist office...I love this town. My two favorite things are here - Jesus and show business.'
