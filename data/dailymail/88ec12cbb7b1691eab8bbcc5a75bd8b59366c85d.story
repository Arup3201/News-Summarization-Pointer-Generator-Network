Eleven members of the same Brazilian family are in a critical condition in hospital after unwittingly cooking up the world's deadliest fish for their supper, it was reported today.

The pufferfish was caught by members of the Souza family while fishing near Duque de Caxias and contained a toxin 1,200 times more lethal than cyanide - a drop of which can kill within 24 hours.

The poison paralyses the muscles while the victim remains fully conscious, eventually dying of asphyxiation when the venom reaches the diaphragm.

The Souza family reportedly fried and served up the fish they had been given by a friend who had returned from a day's sea fishing near their home in Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro.

But seconds after taking their first bite all began to vomit, before losing the feeling in their face, arms and legs.

Most of the victims - which include four children aged three to five - were totally paralysed before they could reach a car that would take them to hospital, according to reports.

Cristiane Souza, whose husband Jose Augusto, 41, ate the fish, said she had called her extended family living nearby for what she thought would be a delicious fish feast on Wednesday evening.

She told Brazil's RJ TV: 'The fish looked so tasty so we invited the whole family. We fried it and everyone tucked in.

Treat: Pufferfish are considered a rare delicacy in Japan, but chefs have to undergo two years of rigorous training and be officially licensed to prepare them

Pufferfish are  the second-most poisonous vertebrates in the world, after the golden poison frog.

Most contain tetrodotoxin - a substance that makes them foul tasting and lethal to fish.

There is enough of the powerful toxin tetrodoxin in one pufferfish to kill 30 adult humans, and there is no known antidote. 

Symptoms can include dizziness, exhaustion, headache, nausea and eventually asphyxiation, resulting in death.

Pufferfish meat is called 'fugu' in Japan, and is considered a delicacy.

It can only be cooked by trained chefs who must cut and trim the fish perfectly to avoid poisoning their customers.

Pufferfish range between one inch and two feet long - although they triple in size when threatened.

'My husband was the first to say he couldn't feel his tongue, then his face, and then his arms. Then his legs went dead and he couldn't stand up any more. It was terrfying.

'My brother-in-law was the same. He didn't even make it out the door. We had to carry them out and rush them to hospital in a car.'

Grandmother Maria do Carmo said: 'We had no idea it was a pufferfish. They're all in a critical condition. My grandson, my daughter, and my son-in-law, they are all in hospital. We're praying for a miracle.

'We put the fish on the table in the yard outside and everyone dived in. They were all saying how delicious it was.'

'I didn't eat it because I was waiting until everyone had tried it.'
