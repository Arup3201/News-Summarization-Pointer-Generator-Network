After Europe's Ryder Cup-winning weekend, the players could be forgiven for taking a week off to recuperate. But not Rory McIlroy, who was straight back on the golf course 48 hours after Sunday's success.

Practicing with his dad Gerry ahead of the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship at Kingsbarn, in which they take part annually, McIlroy looked in good spirits as the pair played 18 holes.

McIlroy joins a stellar line-up of golfers for the Dunhill tournament, including European captain Paul McGinley, as well as other Ryder Cups heroes in the form of Martin Kaymer, Victor Dubuisson and Stephen Gallacher.

World number one McIlroy is favourite to win the event, but will face stiff competition in the Thursday-Sunday tournament, which pays $800,000 to the champion.

McIlroy will compete with his dad over four days, where the field will play three courses in rotation for the first three days, before returning to the Old Course at St Andrews for Sunday. 

The tournament is famous for its pro-am contest, which will feature an array of stars from the world of sport, television and film.

This year, the all-star line-up includes Johan Cruyff, Michael Ballack, Gianfranco Zola, Sir Ian Botham, and Shane Warne.
