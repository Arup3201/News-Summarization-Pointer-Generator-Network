Honoured: Baroness Thatcher will receive a ceremonial funeral with military honours, Downing Street has said

The armed forces will line the streets of London as Baroness Thatcher is given a ceremonial funeral with full military honours, Downing Street said today.

A date is yet to be confirmed but the funeral - set to be the biggest farewell staged for a former prime minister since that of Winston Churchill in 1965 - is expected to take place next week.

Britain's first and only female prime minister died at the Ritz hotel today, where she been living in recent months after spending Christmas in hospital.

Number 10 said a wide range of friends and colleagues are to be invited to the service at St Paul's, which will be followed by a private cremation.

The funeral itself will be televised.

Some Tory MPs had called for a full state funeral - usually reserved for monarchs - for Lady Thatcher, but she had stated before she died that she did not want one.

She told her friend and spokesman Lord Bell that a military fly-past like the one seen at the state funeral held for Winston Churchill would be 'a waste of money'.

The day before the funeral the coffin will be transferred to the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft in the Palace of Westminster.

There will be a short service following its arrival before the coffin rests in the chapel overnight.

A Downing Street statement said: 'On the day itself, the streets will be cleared of traffic and the coffin will travel by hearse from the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft in the Palace of Westminster to the Church of St Clement Danes, the RAF Chapel, on the Strand.

'At the church the coffin will be transferred to a gun carriage drawn by the King's Troop Royal Artillery. The coffin will then be borne in procession from St Clement Danes to St Paul's Cathedral.'

The route from the Church of St Clement Danes will be lined by personnel from the RAF, the Navy and the Army before it is met at St Paul's by a guard of honour.

Members of the armed services and pensioners of the Royal Hospital Chelsea will line the steps of St Paul's.

Former colleagues, as well as the Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, will be invited.

Flags were being flown at half mast at Downing Street today, and will remain so tomorrow.

They will be at half mast again on the day of Lady Thatcher's funeral.

Downing Street said that the former 
prime minister's family had asked that if people wish to pay their 
respects, they consider making a donation to the Royal Hospital Chelsea,
rather than laying flowers.

The Number 10 website will have a 
condolence page on which people will be able to write private messages 
for the Thatcher family.

The public will be unable to attend 
the funeral service itself but can line the route of the funeral 
procession from the RAF Church in the Strand to St Paul's Cathedral, 
said Number 10.

Lord Bell said: 'She specifically did not want a state funeral and nor did her family. She particularly did not wish to lie in state as she thought that was not appropriate.

'And she didn't want a fly-past as she thought that was a waste of money - somewhat in character you might think.

'She expressed those views to me personally and she will get what she wanted.'

Lord Bell's comments came after several Tory MPs said Lady Thatcher should be granted a full state funeral.

Alun Cairns of Vale of Glamorgan wrote on Twitter: 'Margaret Thatcher deserves a state funeral after transforming our nation in such a positive way. The changes were never reversed.'

Dover and Deal MP Charlie Elphicke said he thought Lady Thatcher should receive a full state funeral but he respected the family's wishes.

He said: 'My personal view is that an appropriate celebration of her life would be a state funeral with full honours. However, I understand that her and her family's wishes were not to have that and I respect that.'

Should Baroness Thatcher be given a state funeral?

The date of the funeral, which will be followed by a private cremation, is yet to be confirmed.

A
statement released by Downing Street today said: 'We can announce that,
with the Queen’s consent, Lady Thatcher will receive a ceremonial 
funeral with military honours.

'The
service will be held at St Paul’s Cathedral. A wide and diverse range 
of people and groups with connections to Lady Thatcher will be invited.

'The service will be followed by a private cremation.

'All the arrangements being put in place are in line with wishes of Lady Thatcher’s family.'

Further details will be published in the coming days, the statement said.

There are few visible differences between a state funeral and a ceremonial funeral, although officially the former requires the approval of Parliament.
