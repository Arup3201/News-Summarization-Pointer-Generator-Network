Hosts Morocco  demanded on Saturday that the African Cup of Nations be postponed for a year because of the widening Ebola epidemic.

But a government statement did not answer an ultimatum from the Confederation of African Football (CAF) calling on Morocco to say whether it would still host the tournament from January 17 to February 8.

The statement released by the Ministry of Sports said the country was faced with 'a strictly health linked case of force majeure' in making its call for a postponement 'from 2015 to 2016'.

Morocco had already called on CAF to push back the tournament but African football bosses had refused to change the dates. 

CAF is to meet on Tuesday to decide its next step. Last week it had ruled unanimously that the competition should go ahead, despite the health threat.

The confederation pointed out that of the three countries worst effected by the disease, only Sierra Leone can still qualify, while there have been no incidents of Ebola in Morocco.
