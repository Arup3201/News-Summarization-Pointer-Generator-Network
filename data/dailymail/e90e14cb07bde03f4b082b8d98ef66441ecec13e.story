Nigel Pearson spent the last quarter of this match pushing his team on from his technical area, clapping, cajoling, instructing.

He has experienced a great escape at the Hawthorns before, in 2005 as assistant to Bryan Robson. Beyond 90 minutes, Jamie Vardy scored a goal that gave an exhilarating indication another improbable story could yet be told.

Leicester secured their second consecutive Premier League win to bring safety into view for the first time in a long time. Pearson’s side are still bottom, but now just three points behind Hull in 17th. With seven games to go, five at home, they are still very much in this fight.

Vardy personifies that more than anyone. In the first minute of added time he bullied Gareth McAuley to gain possession by the halfway line and advanced on goal. Joleon Lescott was unable to halt him and in a flash the ball was in the net.

Pearson turned to his bench and held both arms aloft. He had switched to three at the back at the interval and made all his substitutions with half an hour to go, and been vindicated.

Trailing 2-1, Leicester had equalised in the 80th minute when Marc Albrighton delivered a cross that reached David Nugent at the far post. He hooked the ball back, Marcin Wasilewski won the header and Robert Huth nodded beyond Craig Dawson on the line.

This was a second consecutive home loss to a team in trouble for West Brom, following the 4-1 defeat to Queens Park Rangers.

It had all begun so brightly for the hosts on a day to honour their late, great striker Jeff Astle, scorer of the winning goal in the 1968 FA Cup. West Brom looked resplendent in their replica kits from that year, numbered one to 11.

Darren Fletcher paid a fitting tribute with a very good glancing header to Chris Brunt’s corner. Goal-line technology was required to confirm the goal after Esteban Cambiasso cleared. It was Fletcher’s first goal since scoring for Manchester United in November 2012.

Leicester equalised in the 20th minute. Cambiasso took a long free-kick that Leonardo Ulloa flicked forward for Nugent to stroke in a composed finish.

West Brom went ahead again six minutes later when Craig Gardner’s volley deflected off Wes Morgan into the net. But Leicester struck back impressively and, from nowhere, have genuine hope of survival.

‘You never want to come off the field with regrets,’ said Pearson. ‘If we can maximise that home advantage we have a chance. I don’t think at any point this season [the] players doubted themselves.’

West Brom are not yet safe and face a frightening run-in. ‘The first goal is lower-league stuff,’ said Pulis. ‘The third goal, Gareth’s trying to play like a right winger. You can’t do that at this level.’
