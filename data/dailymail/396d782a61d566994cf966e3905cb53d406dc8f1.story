If we told you you could stay trim while eating ice cream - the same ice cream, no less, favoured by British male supermodel David Gandy - you'd probably throw Cornettos in our faces.

But it's true.

High-protein ice cream brand Wheyhey (available in strawberry, chocolate and vanilla) is sugar-free, gluten-free, has 66 per cent less fat than normal ice cream, packs just 125 calories per 100ml, and contains 22g of protein per tub - the same amount as 70g of chicken breast.

No wonder burly gym aficionado Mr Gandy - who understands the importance of a high-protein diet to maintain his impressive physique - has secured their future with a financial investment.

Hello, ladies: David Gandy has given his support to high-protein ice cream brand Wheyhey

The supermodel told Vogue: 'I like to support new, innovative British people and brands,
and Wheyhey is a guilt-free answer to one of our favorite treats,
ice cream.

'Protein is a highly important part of
of your nutritional content whether training or not and it makes
the product unique.

'I met the team who are young and full of energy
and ideas, tasted the range and was hooked!

Wheyhey ice cream is made primarily of water, whey protein isolate, xylitol sweetener, whole cream and emulsifier.

Compared to regular ice cream which contains around 11g of fat per 100g, Wheyhey contains just 4g of fat.
