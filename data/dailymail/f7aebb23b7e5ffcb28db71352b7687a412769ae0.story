A woman
accused of having a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old female student while
teaching at a Utah high school has avoided jail and will have to serve 100
hours of community service, 18 months of probation and pay a $900 fine instead.

Courtney Louise
Jarrell, 23, had faced up to three years in jail, but Judge Bruce Lubeck
today decided against any time in prison after both prosecutors, Jarrell’s lawyers and
even the student asked that she be kept out of jail.

In February, Jarrell pled guilty to three counts of
misdemeanor sexual battery and agreed to give up her teaching license. She initially
faced charges of object rape, a first-degree felony,
and forcible sexual abuse, a second-degree felony.

By pleading guilty to misdemeanor charges,
she does not have to register as a sex offender.

‘I’ve lost my teaching license and that was something that I worked
really hard for and I've been punished throughout the year with different
things,' Jarrell told Lubeck, crying, KSL
reported. ‘I'll never be in a school again like that. I don't even know if I
can go on field trips with my nieces' or nephews' or kids' schools and that's
really hard for me. I feel like it was a big deal for me to lose that.’

Jarrell was accused of touching the female student's breast and genitals.
 She had been initially charged with object rape and forcible sexual 
abuse, but the charges have been downgraded to a middemeanor under a plea.

Her attorney, Ken Brown, said that Jarrell is still the focus of
criticism and has lost her teaching license as a result of her action.
He added that Jarrell told the student to wait until she was 18 before having
sex. In February, he said the relationship was consensual as well

‘Ms. Jarrell is a good person and, as I indicated throughout this case,
she fell in love with a student,' he said. ‘I don't think she was abusing
anyone's trust.’

Jarrell
was arrested in April 2013 on allegations she fondled and raped a 17-year-old
female student, just eight months after she took a job teaching at Riverton
High School.

The
school district received a complaint in March of last year that Jarrell had had
sexual contact with one of her female students.

Jarrell was a high school softball star and the captain of her basketball team at Davis High School in Kaysville

The
alleged abuse took place at her home last February or March. Police said she
touched the female student's breasts and genitals.

Jarrell
taught math at Riverton High and coached the sophomore girls' basketball team.

The 5
foot 8 young woman was a high school softball star and the captain of her
basketball team at Davis High School in Kaysville, 30 minutes north of Salt
Lake City.

She also
played softball in college at Utah Valley University and majored in secondary
education.
