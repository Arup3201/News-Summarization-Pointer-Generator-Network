A woman involved in the case arrives at Central London Employment Tribunal. It is alleged that a property tycoon slept with his PA then sacked her when his wife found out

A property tycoon slept with his PA then sacked her when his wife found out, a tribunal has heard.

The chief executive allegedly treated his mistress to a car and a luxury flat in London during the course of their three-year relationship.

He took her on holidays to Cuba and Australia and promoted her to a £40,000-a-year position, it  was claimed.

He is even said to have asked the 32-year-old to arrange a threesome with an Australian employee – offering to help with her visa if she agreed.

But when his wife found out, the 56-year-old boss fired the PA and told her: ‘Don’t you ****ing come back,’ the tribunal heard. London Central Employment Tribunal, which heard the case last week, ordered that none of those involved can be named.

The chief executive, whose property company has a portfolio worth billions, routinely harassed women in his office, the tribunal was told.

It was claimed he had a preference for recruiting pretty, young female surveyors and admin staff, and would call them ‘slappers’.

The PA, who began her affair with her boss soon after she started at the company in 2008, claimed he got rid of her after a former business associate sent his wife a letter disclosing their affair.

She told the hearing: ‘In December 2010, he told me his wife had received a letter from somebody telling her about our relationship, and about various details like the flat, and that we had gone on holidays.

‘After that, he started asking me to leave. He said that his wife was putting pressure on him to sever all ties with me. [But] he told me he wasn’t going to get rid of me just to please his wife.’

The pair continued to sleep together, but he became rude and dismissive in the office, she said.

She wept as she added: ‘I did feel at certain times that if I didn’t sleep with him then he would get very angry.’ She claimed he eventually offered her a £50,000 tax-free redundancy package to leave, as his children would no longer speak to him because of his cheating, but that she refused.

Two months later, in a heated phone call, he sacked her, she said. ‘I asked, “Are you firing me?” and he replied: “Yes, don’t you ****ing come back”, and told me I was sacked.’

The claimant told the hearing: ‘His attitude was that female staff  members could get ahead in business not on their merits but by using their sexuality.

‘When we were recruiting a receptionist, he instructed me to tell the recruitment agency not to send anyone fat, old or male.

‘Throughout my time at the company he would choose attractive female staff members to attend meetings with external parties or difficult clients and would say “we’ll ask her to wear a short skirt” or “we’ll ask her to wear a low cut top”.’

She also claimed he ‘pestered’ her to encourage an Australian staff member to have a threesome ‘in return for sponsoring her visa so she could stay in the UK’.

David Massarella, representing the company boss, put it to the woman that it ‘simply didn’t fit’ that his client tried to force her out, because he had recently given her a pay rise, renewed the lease on her flat and said he would pay for her to take her property surveyor exams so she could further her career.

Mr Massarella said the PA had repeatedly accused her boss of seeing other colleagues and even of spending the night with a prostitute.

She said: ‘I’d heard from someone he was seeing a prostitute. At the time, we were having unprotected sex and I was concerned.’

But when he told her he had not slept with a prostitute, just gone out with her, his mistress said: ‘He always told me lots of lies.’

Asked why she would want to work for someone who was a habitual liar, she said: ‘I loved that job.’

Mr Massarella accused her of bombarding his client with texts and phones calls – at one point calling him 29 times in one day.

She is suing the property company for unfair dismissal and sex discrimination. The hearing was adjourned.
