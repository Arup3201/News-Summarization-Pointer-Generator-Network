Steve Bruce spent close to £40m in the summer transfer window, but the Hull manager cannot have done many better bits of business than the acquisition of Mohamed Diame and Andy Robertson.

The pair, who cost about £6.3m between them, combined to score the crucial first goal against Crystal Palace before Nikica Jelavic sealed the points with a minute to go, ending Neil Warnock’s run of unbeaten league matches.

Diame’s header in the 60th minute from Robertson’s left-wing cross was his third goal in four matches since signing from West Ham.

Jelavic then added his fourth goal of the season in the closing stages after being put through on goal by Jake Livermore. 

‘In the end it was a wonderful cross and a great finish from Diame to get us the victory then a good finish from Jela too,’ Bruce said.

‘I first came across Diame when he was at Wigan and blasted one in .

‘I think he got me the sack when I was at Sunderland, actually. He’s a really good player.

‘He’s got a right foot, a left foot and now he’s scored with a header.

He’s not quite complete but he’s big, strong, athletic, he handles the ball well. He’s good in the air.

‘He’s had a really good start so let’s hope it continues.’

Hull came into this having conceded 13 goals in a winless run of five matches, so it was little surprise that Bruce opted to revert to the 3-5-2 system that has served him so well in his two years with the club.

The Tigers based promotion from the Championship and then survival on a sound defensive base but that steely determination has eluded them recently.

The onus was on wingbacks Ahmed Elmohamady and Robertson to bombard Palace with crosses and Hull finally carved out a chance when the visitors failed to fully clear a delivery from the former.

Diame played a one-two with Abel Hernandez to create space eight yards out but the Senegal midfielder’s shot from an angle flashed across the face of goal and wide.

The visitors finally cracked on the hour mark.

Hull had plenty of bodies forward and another accurate Robertson cross from the left was met by the head of Diame, giving Julian Speroni no chance.

Yannick Bolasie was quiet but burst into life when he checked inside to shoot from 30 yards. 

At 39, goalkeeper Steve Harper was sprightly enough to keep it out with a one-handed save. 

Nikica Jelavic fires home to put the result beyond doubt; his 89th minute goal made the score 2-0 and ensured Crystal Palace went home with nothing

As Palace pushed forward, they were susceptible on the break and Hull took advantage in the 89th minute. Livermore won possession in midfield and threaded a pass through to Jelavic. The Croatian kept his cool to check inside Martin Kelly before firing right-footed under Speroni.

‘I can’t fault the effort but we needed a little bit more belief,’ Warnock said.

‘When we went a goal down, that was our best spell but I wanted to see that before we went a goal down. I thought it was a compliment that they changed their system completely.’
