Her mother is one of the world's most famously stylish women so perhaps its no surprise that Kate Moss' daughter Lila Grace has a penchant for fashion.

According to Moss, her daughter is currently 'obsessed' with the film The Devil Wears Prada which offers a tongue-in-cheek look behind the scenes at a glossy fashion magazine.

'Lila's watched The Devil Wears Prada 10 times,' revealed the model in an interview with Allure magazine.

'She wants to be Anne Hathaway [who played put-upon assistant, Andy Sachs]. She's so into fashion.'

So enamoured with the film is 11-year-old Lila, she even has a little desk in her bedroom where she plays at being assistant to Runway magazine's ferocious editor-in-chief, Miranda Priestly.

'She puts on a little outfit, picks up the phone and says, "Hello, Miranda Priestly's office." I say, "Do you know who Miranda Priestly is in real life?" But she just doesn't care.

'She's like, "Hello, Miranda Priestly's office. Can you hold? (Photographer) Patrick Demarchelier on the line"

'I died when I heard her. She's so funny. She doesn't have a clue who it is but it's word for word.'

Glamorous: Moss also revealed that she wasn't always body confident and hated her teeth and flat chest

In real life, Miranda Priestly is, of course, the famously icy Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of US Vogue, whose cover Moss has graced in the past.

Although Moss is now confident in her good looks, she told Allure that when she began, she was far from convinced.

'I didn't like my teeth or my flat chest,' she revealed. 'I was like, "I'm going to have a t*t job." Can you imagine?

'I was the opposite of Cindy Crawford and those girls.'
