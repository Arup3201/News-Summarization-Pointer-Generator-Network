This is the horrifying moment an out of control motorbike crashed into a cameraman who was filming nearby costing him his leg.

Noel Greaves-Lord was left with a bone sticking through his skin after the powerful Ducati superbike slammed into him at speed while losing control on a bend on a road in Cannes in the south of France.

The father-of-three from Worthing in West Sussex underwent multiple operations to fix a severe fracture to his right ankle, which he sustained in the collision.

The front bike then appears to lose control after coming off the bend in the road and begin to hurtle towards the cameraman 

But he contracted an untreatable form of MRSA and doctors were forced to amputate his leg to save his life.

The 52-year-old, who covered sporting events for the BBC, Sky and ITV, now has to wear a prosthetic leg and has given up his job.

But now he has been awarded a massive undisclosed payout from the motorcyclist's insurers following a four-year battle.

Mr Greaves-Lord travelled to Cannes to carry out some filming as a favour to a friend.

But while he was filming near to a road, an out of control motorbike crashed into him, with the whole incident being captured on camera.

The father-of-three from Worthing in West Sussex underwent multiple operations to fix a severe fracture to his right ankle. He eventually had to have his leg amputated after contracting an untreatable form of MRSA 

He said: 'The bike just slipped out and it happened very, very quickly.

'You replay it in your mind and think could I have done anything different to get out of the way but there was nothing I could do.

'I just stuck my leg out to protect myself and it hit the sole of my foot and broke my ankle but luckily it pushed me out of harm’s way.

'It could’ve been so much worse. It could’ve killed me.

Mr Greaves-Lord now has to wear a prosthetic leg and has had to give up his job. He has just been awarded a massive payout from the motorcyclist's insurers following a four-year battle

'I was in extreme pain and was conscious the whole time and aware something was seriously wrong.

'I thought I’d lost my leg right then and there.

'But my friend who was a medic explained everything would be okay and an ambulance came.

'It took eight minutes apparently but it was the longest eight minutes of my life.'

Mr Greaves-Lord underwent a year of operations before doctors advised that he would need to have his leg amputated.

Now, four years later, he has received a compensation payout after a legal wrangle in the High Court, in London.

He added: 'I am pleased and relieved that my legal battle has come to a conclusion and I can now focus completely on rebuilding my life and continue with my recovery and rehabilitation.

'The last four years have been devastating and the injuries I sustained in France have had a huge impact on my life.

'I had always been a very active and independent man but I have struggled to come to terms with the impact the injury and subsequent amputation has had on my life.'

The settlement will serve as compensation for the loss of his leg and to cover the financial losses since the crash in October 2010 as well as the ongoing costs of his rehabilitation.

Demetrius Danas, a lawyer for Irwin Mitchell who helped Mr Greaves-Lord receive the settlement, said: 'We are delighted that we have been able to secure a settlement which reflects Noel’s complex needs as understandably he and his family have been concerned about what the future might hold.

'Noel has been incredibly courageous throughout this most challenging time and his determination and spirit are inspirational.'
