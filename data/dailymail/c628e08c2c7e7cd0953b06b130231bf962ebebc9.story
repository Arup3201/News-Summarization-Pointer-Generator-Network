Swaying gently in the evening breeze, these glowing balloons floating in the night skies along the length of Hadian's Wall are a striking sight in the middle of the British countryside.

More than 400 huge balloons, measuring six feet in diameter and lit by internal lights, were tethered along the historic 73-mile wall as part of a unique digital art installation.

Hundreds of people gathered to gaze upon the atmospheric scene last night (Friday) as the balloons became a line of pulsating colour stretching from North Tyneside to Cumbria.

Called Connecting Light, the installation has been designed by New York-based digital arts collective YesYesNo, founded by Zachary Lieberman.

People were encouraged to interact with the installation by sending messages which would be transmitted along the wall via the lights within the balloons - turning them into a line of pulsating colours.

The concept behind the project - which will be live again tonight (Saturday) - is to view Hadrian's Wall, part of an ancient fortress, as a structure that inspires communication, rather than division.

The balloons are positioned across the 73 miles of Hadrian's Wall from Segedunum Roman Fort at Wallsend, North Tyneside, to Bowness-on-Solway, Cumbria.

Special viewing locations have been set up along the length of the wall for art-lovers keen to catch a glimpse of the unique project, which was organised as part of the London 2012 Festival.
