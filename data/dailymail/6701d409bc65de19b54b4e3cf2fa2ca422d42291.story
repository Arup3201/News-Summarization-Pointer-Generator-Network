It is one trademark celebration we’ve seen rather a lot of this season. At the final whistle, if Ipswich have claimed the three points, their captain Luke Chambers hangs around on the pitch.

The fans linger too, knowing what’s coming. When all his team-mates have drifted off towards the tunnel, Chambers runs towards the stands and gives a victory shout and a fist pump. The crowd respond with a guttural roar of their own.

On Saturday at Portman Road, Chambers did the celebratory fist pump no less than six times. It was, by popular Twitter consensus, the most passionate one yet. But then this had probably been the team’s best performance yet.

‘We are going up,’ chorused the home faithful as Chambers (pictured) finally made his way off. They may well do. Ipswich look better equipped to mount a promotion challenge than in any of the last dozen campaigns since they dropped out of the Premier League.

This was a surprisingly straightforward victory against a high-flying Middlesbrough side usually so assured on their travels but timid and toothless here. One of the Ipswich scorers was expected, the other less so.

Republic of Ireland international Daryl Murphy rattled home his 14th of the season to move top of the Championship scorers’ chart, before Jay Tabb headed in the contest-killing second.

The diminutive Tabb, discarded by his former club Reading, may have found himself on the scrapheap again at the end of last season but stayed at Ipswich to fight for his place — with outstanding results.

‘I think I was waxing lyrical about him last week,’ said manager Mick McCarthy. ‘He just continues to flourish and get better and better.

‘We made them all back themselves in a little sweepstake within the club and if they don’t get the goals, their £100 goes to charity. He only needs another seven so he’d better pull his finger out.’

There was an amusing debate about Tabb’s actual stature. Wikipedia suggested 5ft 7in, McCarthy thought that might be generous. Either way, he managed to outmuscle two burly Boro players in Emilio Nsue and Albert Adomah to head in Teddy Bishop’s perfect cross.

‘I’m 5ft 5in, maybe 5ft 6in but I have always had a good leap on me,’ said Tabb. ‘I win my fair share of headers out there on the wing.

‘I saw the ball come in and I just timed my jump well. I probably leaned into them a bit to win it but I managed to get above them.

‘Mick said to me at the end of last season things haven’t really worked out so if a club came in for me or I wanted to leave he would not stand in my way.

‘But I said “no” straight away. I like Ipswich Town, I like Suffolk, I like the gaffer and TC [assistant manager Terry Connor], and I wanted to stay and fight for my place. I’ve done that and it’s working out.’

With left-back Tyrone Mings linked with a move to Arsenal, McCarthy is also braced for a flurry of interest in 18-year-old midfielder Bishop, whom Boro boss Aitor Karanka described as the best player on the park.

Bishop, a product of the club’s academy, has made his breakthrough this season but McCarthy issued a stern hands-off.

‘It would be wrong anyway. He should play his football here. It’s funny, when he starts doing well, everyone wants to get him out the door and sell him to a big Premier League club. If he wants to play in the Premier League, let’s see if we get there,’ said the Ipswich manager.

You can only imagine the Chambers fist pump if they do make it.

Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe insisted the Capital One Cup loss to Liverpool wouldn’t affect his team. 

He was proved emphatically correct as the Cherries routed Blackpool 6-1 to ensure the Championship No 1 spot at Christmas. 

Matt Ritchie’s goal to make it 3-0 was pick of the bunch.

‘It was an horrendous day,’ said Blackpool manager Lee Clark. ‘I’m angry, disappointed, embarrassed and upset.’

Not the best start for new Reading boss Steve Clarke as they went down 1-0 at home to 10-man Watford. 

They’ve now not scored in their last three Championship games at the Madejski.

MK Dons boss Karl Robinson said his team were ‘sensational’ as they routed Oldham 7-0 to move into the automatic promotion spots in League One.

Will Grigg struck twice and there were five other scorers.

Luton left Newport’s nine-match unbeaten run in tatters with a 3-0 win at Kenilworth Road to move third in League Two. 

The Hatters have won their last eight home league games.
