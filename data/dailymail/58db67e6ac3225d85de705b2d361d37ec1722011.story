The moment the wave struck was caught on video by a witness and sent to French TV station TF1.

The area is known for being dangerous and walkers are strongly advised to avoid, according to Le Parisien.

The video shows three people walking along the pathway when a huge wave rises up from the sea.

One of the men manages to scramble to safety running up the steps on the pathway.

But two remaining walkers are both dragged out to sea and can be seen bobbing around in the water, before another wave submerges them.

Their walking companion who has just escaped is evidently in shock and in the clip the cameraman filming the terrfying scene shouts out to him:  'Your friends, they are in the water. Call the police quickly, don't mess around.'

One witness named Nicolas recounted what happened on Monday to BFM TV, reports The Local.

'We
 called out to them to tell them to go back. It was too dangerous. But 
they do not hear us with the sound of the wind and the waves. Then a big
 wave came and they went over the railings. '

The man was found in the water after 20 minutes and taken to hospital. Despite a helicopter search the missing woman has not been found.
