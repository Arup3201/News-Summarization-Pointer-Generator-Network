A British man truly took the plunge when he proposed to his girlfriend as he popped the question after they had skydived from 15,000ft.

Luke Harding, 26, had planned ahead to create the ultimate romantic scene. After convincing Rachel Hughes, 29, to join in him for a spectacular parachute jump, he arranged for her to land on a sun-kissed Australian beach where he was waiting down on one knee with a ring, flowers and a huge sign reading, "will you marry me?" 

Luke, from Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, had taken three months to plan the proposal after he and Rachel had decided to go travelling.

Taking the plunge: Rachel has no idea what's in store as she and Luke prepare for their skydive

Plan in motion: Luke leapt out of the plane with an instructor first

Excited: He would land on Geographe Bay in Western Australia and wait for Rachel down on one knee

He said: 'Getting down on one knee in a 
restaurant just wouldn't be me, so I guess this is the reason for making
 it extravagant.

'A skydive 
seemed the most logical thing. It was then a question of finding a 
company who could accommodate my request and also at a location of pure 
natural beauty.

'I always knew she would say yes and I wasn't nervous about the skydive or proposal.'

The coasteering instructor spent weeks scouting for 
locations before deciding upon Geographe Bay in Western 
Australia and getting outdoor adventures firm Southern Skydivers on board with his plan.

Surprise! As Rachel landed on the beach after Luke, he popped the question

Sealed with a kiss: She said yes

After getting Rachel to join him for the skydive, he then had to ensure he leapt out first so he could be in position when she landed.

Rachel's tandem dive instructor gave Luke a few moments headstart before angling their 65 second descent so 
she came in to land right in front of his giant banner.

She immediately said "yes" after Luke popped the question with a blue sapphire Vera Wang engagement ring.

Rachel said the romantic moment completely took her by surprise.

She said: 'I had absolutely no idea 
he was planning this. As we swooped round in the air to line up for our landing I could see the banner and when it clicked I couldn't believe it.

'I
 mean just an hour earlier Luke dropped the bombshell that we were going
 to do a skydive and then I'm seeing a "will you marry me" banner. I just felt like I was dreaming and then reality kicked in and with it my emotions. 

More in store: The couple then moved onto a surprise engagement party Luke had arranged

Wedding bells: The globe-trotting pair will return to the UK for a summer wedding in 2015

Dream come true: Rachel said she loved her romantic proposal

'Glenn, my tandem buddy, swooped me down right in front of Luke and I couldn't wait for him to disconnect me.

'Luke
 then asked those famous words every girl dreams of hearing, "will you 
marry me" and with that I couldn't hug him tight enough.'

Keen travellers, Luke and Rachel met 
three years ago before heading to New Zealand and Australia for a 
two-year trip of a lifetime.

They had been staying in Perth and 
working in a restaurant so Luke had even arranged for some of their friends to meet them after the proposal for a surprise engagement party at a venue near the beach.

Luke said: 'The
 great thing about all of this is that Rachel usually guesses when I'm 
up to something, or planning anything and also has a terrible habit of 
guessing what it is also.

'However
 on this occasion she didn't have a clue. Which was key to the success, I
 wanted the whole day to be one surprise after another after another.

'Even down to the surprise engagement party I threw for her our friends at the end of the day. A feeling of pure elation and couple this with feeling like the luckiest guy on earth sums it up pretty good.'

The couple plan to fly back to the UK in October ahead 
of their August 2015 wedding.
