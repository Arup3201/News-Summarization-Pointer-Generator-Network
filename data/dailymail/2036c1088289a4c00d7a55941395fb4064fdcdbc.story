A woman and her boyfriend were shot to death in cold blood by a lone gunman in the parking lot of a Bronx motel early Saturday, according to police.

Witnesses said the female victim, identified as 38-year-old Tracy Bennett, of Elmont, was heard wailing, 'Don't do it! Don't do it!' before the shooter pulled the trigger, killing her outside the Holiday Motel at 2291 New England Thruway.

The incident took place after the gunman approached her 50-year-old boyfriend, reggaeton singer Wayne Hamilton, outside the motel office at around 3.15am, police said.

The perpetrator shot Hamilton, who goes by the stage name Captain Barkey, several times in the back of the head as the victim tried to run way.

The killer then turned his attention to his 38-year-old girlfriend standing near a parked Toyota Camry with the motor running and shot her in the head as well.

Witnesses who were celebrating a birthday in a room upstairs said they overheard four to five gunshots break out, 1010 WINS reported, before running to see what was happening.

'I looked out my window and saw a lady standing there,' party guest Ricky Gugliotta told the New York Daily News.

'She was begging him not to shoot her, but then he shot her twice and she went down.'

Both Bennett and Hamilton were pronounced dead at the scene by EMS.

The suspect, described as a bald man, fled the scene in a blue or green sedan, sources told the Daily News.

Motel patron Augustine Mawugbe, 45, told DNAInfo he was asleep in his room when he heard gunshots.

Mawugbe said he looked outside and saw a tall man in a brown polo shirt firing a pistol.

‘He jumped into the car and drove away. He drove fast,’ he added. He said the man fired about ten times, and got into a light green Toyota Camry or Ford Taurus.

According to the New York Post, the shooter may have been the woman's ex-boyfriend.

Hamilton's friends who stopped by the crime scene Saturday afternoon said he was originally from Jamaica but was now living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

‘I saw him last night at Memories playing dominoes,’ said Oneil Taylor, referring to a Bronx nightclub.

Another friend, an shuttle driver, said he had picked up Hamilton Friday from the airport and brought him to the Fenton Avenue club. 

Tragedy: Guests at the motel saw Hamilton and his girlfriend celebrating with a bottle of Champagne just hours before the murders

The New York Times said that the victims were staying in a room on the motel’s second floor. Other guests reported seeing the slain couple several hours before the murders with their arms around one another.

Bennett was spotted by one patron holding a bottle of Champagne in a celebratory manner.

So far, no arrests have been made. Police are still trying to determine the motive behind the cold-blooded murders.
