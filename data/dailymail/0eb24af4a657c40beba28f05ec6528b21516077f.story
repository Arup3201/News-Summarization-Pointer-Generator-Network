Active leader: CEO Kevin Clearly revealed the practices

Like a lot of companies plugging health foods and fitness supplements, Clif Bar projects a rugged, wholesome, pro-fitness image.

But, it emerged, the California-based company takes its healthy message so seriously it even pays its employees to work out.

Staff members are allowed two and a half hours of company time every week - or a half-hour a day - to hit the on-site gym.

The facility is complete with personal trainers, daily classes, 'nutritional counselors' - and a boulder-climbing wall.

Workers are also encouraged to switch off completely after working hours - and won't get a response from their CEO via phone or email if it's after 6.30pm.

The push for a balanced, active lifestyle is being led by chief executive Kevin Cleary, who revealed some of his company's  practices in an interview with ABC News.

He said: 'We have a great gym... We encourage everyone to get out and exercise.'

'There's a lot of times I'll go out for a run then I'll walk back through the company and I'm going to a meeting and I'm still sweating, because I'm squeezing the workout in.'

And the family man - who lives with his wife and three sons near Clif Bar's HQ in Emeryville, California -  also said he leads by example in being out of contact after hours.

He said: 'I don't send out emails at night. I don't send them out on the weekend. I may do work, but I won't send out an email.

Wholesome: The California-based company offers other healthy incentives for its workforce

'I don't want to set the expectation that people should be working at 7 or 8 at night. I get home at 6:30. I put the phone in my home office. I leave it there, then I'm just dedicated to my kids'

The company, which is privately-held, also offers employee benefits including the chance to have every second Friday off by putting in extra hours elsewhere, subsidies for leaving the car at home, and the chance to bring their dogs into work.

Employees with seven years' service are also given a paid sabbatical vacation 'for personal growth and renewal'.
