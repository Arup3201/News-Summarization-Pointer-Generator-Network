A 14-year-old girl with Down syndrome who was believed to have run away with a 51-year-old family friend has been found safe.

Elizabeth Rex was found inside a trailer with the older man, Randy Johnson, in Harlingen, South Texas early on Wednesday, Lt. Brady Fitzgerald with the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office said.

Lizzy, whose mental disabilities cause her to act like a five or six year old, appeared to be unharmed but she is being transferred to a local hospital and deputies are in touch with her family.

She was rescued after authorities received a tip-off that she was in Harlingen - which is 350 miles from her home in Magnolia - with Johnson on Tuesday night.

After they were found inside the trailer, Johnson was arrested for 
kidnapping and remains in custody in Harlingen. He is expected to be 
extradited to Montgomery to face official charges.

Lizzy's parents previously revealed that they took Johnson in to their home last year after learning he was suffering from colon cancer.

But
 after he had stayed for eight months, they asked him to leave because 
he was getting 'too close' to Lizzy, whose mental disabilities cause her
 to act like a five or six year old, they said.

'We were literally listening to 
every conversation and it was in code,' her mother Jennifer Black told KHOU. 'So once we decided 
what the codes were, it was like "you have to go, you can't be here".'

Safe: The girl, who has 'a touch' of Down syndrome, acts like a five or six year old, her parents said

Scene: She vanished from outside her family's trailer park home, pictured, on Monday, her parents said

On Monday, Lizzy walked outside the 
home to a park area and vanished. They believe Johnson told her to wait 
outside the family's trailer park for him.

'He
 calls us and says, "Y'all will never see Lizzy again" and 
things like that,' said her dad Patrick Rex. '"Where we're going you 
can't get there". Not even ten minutes later he calls back and goes, 
"La-la-la-la".'

The parents 
added that Johnson claimed he was going to be passing through a 
checkpoint, but pointed out that the family had no IDs to be able to do 
the same.

Johnson, who previously worked with 
Lizzy's father, does not have a car but the parents previously said they believed he and Lizzy
 got a ride south to his hometown of Harlingen.

Concerns: An ABC reporter, right, speaks to Lizzy's father, center, and mother, left, as they claim that Johnson called them and told them they would never see their daughter again

Worry: Lizzy's mother, left with one of Lizzy's sisters, said they had been forced to kick Johnson out of their home after eight months because they noticed he was getting too close to Lizzy

Fears: Lizzy's mother Jennifer Black, pictured, had worried that she will not see her daughter again

Lizzy's parents previously said she has 'a touch of' Down syndrome, autism, attention deficit disorder, bi-polar disorder and pre-developmental disorder.

Her medical conditions cause mental instability and occasional mental breakdowns in high stress 
environments, the Montgomery County Sheriffs Office said.

Her parents had said they were also concerned that she had not taken her medication since she left the home two days ago.
