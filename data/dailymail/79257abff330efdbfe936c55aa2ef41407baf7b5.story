An overweight teaching assistant who cried when she looked at herself in the mirror is now a lingerie model after dropping four dress sizes.

Becci Skelley, 21, weighed more than 14 stones before going on a ‘fruit and soup’ diet and six months later she has shed five stones.

She has now starred in her own lingerie photo book and is also modelling for bridal shows.
