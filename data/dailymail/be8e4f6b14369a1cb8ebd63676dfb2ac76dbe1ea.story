Before every UEFA match there is a meeting of 'emergency personnel' who run through what to do in the event of any major incident before or during the match.

This wouldn't be expected to cover a drone flying over the stadium with a politically-incendiary flag, however.

While the referee does not attend this meeting, he is aware of potential issues, as England's Martin Atkinson would have been ahead of taking charge of Serbia against Albania in Belgrade.

Serbia's game against Albania was abandoned after a drone flying over the stadium sparked chaotic scenes

Serbia defender Stefan Mitrovic pulled down a flag carried by a drone - the Euro 2016 tie was later abandoned 

Albania players flee the pitch and head to the relative safety of their dressing room following the chaos 

The decision to take the players off the field may have been Atkinson's or he could have been advised to do so by UEFA's veteran delegate Harry Been, who is likely to have been sent there with any potential issues in mind.

Once safely back in the referee's dressing room as the trouble unfolded on the pitch and in the stands, there will have been regular updates for Atkinson and his team of English officials as to how things were progressing.

Out of courtesy, he will have been ‘consulted’ regarding the eventual abandonment - but the decision will have ultimately been made by Been.

These incidents are rare but when they do happen it is always nice for the referee to have a senior delegate to take control or responsibility.

People often ask me about the toughest international game I've reffed. I had one particularly tricky incident in a Paraguay vs Colombia World Cup qualifier.

Smoke from flares that had been set off at the start of the game meant that TV companies wanted the game stopped as their viewers couldn’t see the action.

The Argentinian delegate and I decided to keep playing and allowed the smoke to clear. There wasn't any major backlash, although the fourth official got an earful from a TV producer.

I was supposed to referee the Euro 2008 qualifier between Finland and Belgium, but was replaced by Mike Riley after my decision to retire.

He had to stop play for six minutes when an owl landed on the pitch and was swooping on to the goals.

When refereeing, you just have to expect the unexpected and follow the advice of the UEFA delegate.
