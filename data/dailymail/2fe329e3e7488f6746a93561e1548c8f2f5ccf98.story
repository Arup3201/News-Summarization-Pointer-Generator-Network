Riot police were out on the streets in force in major cities across France today as thousands took to the streets to protest against the country’s hardline immigration policies.

It follows a number of violent incidents in Paris on Thursday as students blockaded colleges following the high-profile deportation of a Roma gypsy.

Leonarda Dibrani, 15, was taken off a school bus by police in front of her class mates and then sent back to Kosova last week.

Thousands of people turned out in cities across France today to protest against the deportation of foreign pupils following the high-profile eviction of a 15-year-old Roma girl, Leonarda Dibrani

This was despite the fact that Leonarda, a failed asylum seeker, had spent five years at a French school and spoke the language fluently.

Police were pelted with stones and other projectiles on Thursday and fires were lit as protestors carried banners reading ‘End Expulsions’.

All accused President Francois Hollande’s Socialist government of ‘losing its soul’ as it pledged to get rid of thousands of Roma it associates with crime and public health problems.

There are now fears that the growing 
protests will turn into the kind of major riots last seen in Paris in 
2006 when young people protested against proposed employment laws.

Today the main teaching unions and even a parents’ federation have given their backing to the protests.

Bernadette Groison, head of the main FSU teaching union, said: ‘Nobody should be expelled before they have finished their exams.’

A Paris police spokesman said: ‘A demonstration is expected this afternoon, hence an increased number of police.’

A march being held today was due to end at Place de la Nation at around 3pm, said the spokesman.

Similar demonstrations are also planned for other cities including Bordeaux and Lyon.

The worst riots in years broke out in Moscow this week after Yegor Shcherbakov was murdered. Around 200 people were arrested for violating a public order

The clashes come just days after some of the worst race riots in Russia for years. - sparked by the stabbing of a man in Moscow.

Orhan Zeynalov, a citizen of Azerbaijan, is being held on suspicion of murdering Yegor Shcherbakov, 25, in the streets of the city on October 10.

He is thought to have fatally stabbed the man while he was walking through the city with his girlfriend, which unleashed the worst race riots Moscow has seen in three years.

Nationalists have threatened further protests in areas populated by migrant workers from former Soviet Central Asia and Caucasus states.

Advocacy groups warned migrants are at a high risk of violence as crowds of Muslims celebrated the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha, and a heavy police presence was seen in the capital.

The murder triggered the riots in Moscow's southern Biryulyovo district, where Shcherbakov was attacked.

Tensions have been simmering in Moscow between disenchanted ethnic Russian youths and labour migrants mostly from predominantly Muslim ex-Soviet states.

Hundreds of nationalists gathered near a shopping centre in southern Moscow, Russian wires said, to protest against Shcherbakov's killing in what was promoted online by nationalists as an 'Answer to Eid al-Adha'.
