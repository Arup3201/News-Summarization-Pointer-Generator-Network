The parents of freed American POW Bowe Bergdahl have told their son they love him at a press conference in Idaho, as they reveal they haven't talked to him directly since his release because he is being debriefed by military psychologists in Germany.

Bob and Jani Bergdahl teared up as they spoke of their love for the 28-year-old soldier who was held captive by the Taliban for five years as America's only POW of the war in Afghanistan.

'I love you Bowe,' his mother said Sunday afternoon in Boise. 'I'm so very proud of you and of course your large family also loves you and is proud of you. We have been working very very hard for your release these past five years, never losing hope in you or for you.

'I'm so looking forward to seeing your face and giving you a great big bear hug and holding you in my arms again never wanting to let you go,' she added. 'I will see you soon my beloved son.'

Bob Bergdahl compared Bowe to a diver coming up slowly from the depths with respect to the recovery and reintegration planned following his years spent in captivity.

'We haven't talked to Bowe yet, we haven't called him on the phone... there's a reason for that,' the father, who grew a beard and learned the Pashtun language to show solidarity to his son, said at the Boise conference.

'Bowe has been gone so long that it's going to be difficult to come back. It's like a diver who goes on a dive, if he comes back too fast it could kill him. He needs time to decompress.'

Mr and Mrs Bergdahl praised the administration's handling of Bowe's release.

'The ethos no one left behind is true. You were not left behind, I told you you wouldn't be left behind but it wasn't easy you'll never know how complicated it was. We will never meet most of the people who made this happen,' Mr Bergdahl said.

'It's so big and includes so many people so there's no way we can thank them all.'

The father then slipped between English and Pashtun as he addressed his son, tears welling in his eyes.

'Bowe I love you. I'm your father. I have written to you over and over. Can you speak English still? I hope when you hear this, and you will hear this, I hope your English is coming back. I love you, I'm so proud of you, your character, your patience, and perseverance, your cultural abilities to adapt, your language, your desire and your action to serve this country in a long and difficult war.

'But most of all, I'm so proud of your wanting to help the Afghan people. For how far you were willing to go to help them and you have succeeded. It is an amazing testimony of human endurance and gives hope for the loved ones who still have captive loved ones over the world.'

The parents landed back home in Boise earlier on Sunday to make preparations for the long awaited return of their son.

MailOnline was on the same flight as jubilant Bob and Jani Bergdahl as they returned from their meeting with President Barack Obama at the White House in Washington.

They took connecting Delta flight 2106 via Salt Lake City and received a rapturous applause by passengers on the packed aircraft as it touched down in Boise.

Mr Bergdahl stood up and smiled before saying to airline staff who had announced the family's presence: 'Thank you, we're looking forward to getting our son back.'

A few hours after the release of American's only prisoner of war, who had been held in captivity for five years, his parents joined President Obama at the White House.

The President had telephoned Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl's parents early Saturday to tell them their son was headed home.

The news Saturday of Bowe's release from captivity spread quickly in his hometown of Hailey in southern Idaho, and residents immediately began making plans for a welcome-home celebration.

An annual event called 'Bring Bowe Back' scheduled for June 28 was quickly renamed 'Bowe is Back.'

'It is going to be Bowe's official welcome-home party even if he's not quite home yet,' organizer Stefanie O'Neill said Saturday.

In Hailey, a town of 7,000 residents 
just down the road from upscale Sun Valley, residents have hung yellow 
ribbons along the one major road that travels through the heart of the 
community. Signs were taped up Saturday that said, 'Bowe is free at 
last!'

Hailey resident Audrey Kirk said she found out about Bergdahl's release after her sister texted her the news.

'I
 remember when he was captured. It was awful,' said Kirk, who attends 
the same church as Bergdahl's parents. 'When I got the text, I just 
started screaming and went to turn on the TV. It's surreal that he's 
coming home.'

Rebecca 
DeShields, also a Hailey resident, said that when she heard about the 
news she grabbed her bike and attached a bright yellow balloon to the 
front. 'This is a story of redemption, this is a story of one of our own
 coming home,' she said.

DeShields was standing outside Zaney's River Street Cafe, where Bergdahl used to work as a barista. The coffee shop became the town's center for friends and acquaintances to show support for Bergdahl.

For years, a sign that hung in the window read 'Get Bowe Back.' On Saturday, it was accompanied with two more signs that said, 'Welcome home, Bowe!' and 'Our prayers have been answered!'

Jeff Gunter, Hailey's police chief, 
described the day as being 'extremely emotional.' Gunter has been close 
friends with Bergdahl's family for the past 25 years.

'Nobody
 can know what they (the parents) went through,' Gunter said. 'But now 
that they're able to reach out and touch him, to hold him, that's 
amazing.'

Bob and Jani Bergdahl live in a modest home off a dirt road about 5 miles outside of Hailey.

They joined President Obama during an appearance in the Rose Garden Saturday evening as he announced Bowe Bergdahl's release.

Bob and Jani Bergdahl planned to speak to the media in Boise on Sunday afternoon.

Bob Bergdahl learned some Pashto, the language spoken by the Taliban, and made a video, distributed via the Internet in May 2011, in a bid to appeal directly to the Taliban for his son's freedom. He also grew a beard as a personal monument to his son's plight.

Governor C.L. 'Butch' Otter issued a statement welcoming the news and expressing gratitude for prayers for Bergdahl's release being answered.

'Today, Idaho gives thanks,' Otter said. 'Soon we all will celebrate Bowe's freedom and homecoming.'
