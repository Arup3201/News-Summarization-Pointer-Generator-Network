When Gordon Spence planted a few cucumber seeds, he was envisaging being able to use the home-grown produce to make a bit of salad for himself and his wife to enjoy.

But the 86-year-old, from Brentwood, Essex, might have to invite a few more friends and family round to share in the feast after coming up with this bumper crop.

The grandfather of five's gardening efforts produced a colossal 21-inch cucumber weighing more than three times the average.

Some of the UK's most super-sized vegetables are showcased every year at the UK National Giant Vegetables Championships.

The monster veg can be so gigantic that forklift trucks are used to move them into display.

A new world-record breaking 18.5ft parsnip was one of more than 200 vegetables unveiled at the competition in the Somerset town of Shepton Mallet last weekend.

The root vegetable is an eye-popping 36 times bigger than the standard parsnip and was lovingly grown by Peter Glazebrook, 68, from Newark, Nottinghamshire.

The retired chartered surveyor has previously held the world record for a 8lbs 40oz potato.

He has also been the double Guinness World Record holder for the heaviest parsnip, at 13lb, and the longest beetroot, at 21ft.

The veteran grower's record-busting reputation is rivalled by Joe Atherton, 56, from Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire. He snapped up the world record for the longest carrot, which he grew to an enormous 19ft 2inches in 2007.

He also held the world record for the heaviest leek, at 6.6kg, in 2001.

His wife stumbled across his monster 
vegetable -
which is twice as long as a normal cucumber - in their greenhouse after
the couple had forgot about the seeds Mr Spence planted last March.

Last week Vera, 85, discovered the three-and-a-half pound vegetable hidden behind a large leaf.

Mr Spence said: 'I couldn’t believe what she was holding in her hands really - I thought it was a dead animal or something.'

'It was so huge but then when we eventually came down we realised it was a cucumber.'

'It looks more like a marrow than a cucumber as I didn’t think a cucumber could grow this big.'

'I just couldn’t believe it. It is the biggest one I have grown by some distance.'

The average cucumber normally weighs in at around 1lbs and measures 10inches in length.

However, the couple’s greenhouse 
giant cannot live up to Chinese farmer Akele Hi's world-record-breaking 
cucumber. It measured an enormous 5ft 7inches long and weighed a 
staggering 154lbs.

Mrs Spence admitted their impressive effort was a complete accident, adding: 'It is a fluke as far as we are concerned.'

But the couple are at odds with what to do with their mammoth vegetable.

Mr Spence joked: 'We might eat it, although it would come in handy if you had a few words with your missus or your husband - wallop, take that.'

For now, the impressive cucumber has become a major talking point in the couple’s kitchen.

The Spence's granddaughter Gemma Sanderson, 29, said: 'I was impressed when I came in and saw it on the kitchen side and I said ‘I need a photo of that’.'

Mr Spence's cucumber is still some way off rivalling Akele Hi's record-breaking 154lbs whopper, pictured
