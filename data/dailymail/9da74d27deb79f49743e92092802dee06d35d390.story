A remarkable teenager with no elbows and only three fingers on each hand has overcome his disability to become a piano prodigy.

Landon Weeks, 16, from Ogden, Utah, was born with rare disorder Phochomelia which means he has short arms which can't bend and only has three fingers on each hand.

However, the determined young man hasn't let his disability hold him back - becoming a talented piano player and recently winning $10,000 in a national schools talent show.

'It just comes to me I guess. When I started playing I fell in love and it just became easier, he told Fox News yesterday. 'I just put my heart in it and it works'.

His mother Lanette Weeks is immensely proud of her son who decided to take up the instrument after watching his three able-bodied brothers play.

'He said: 'I want to play too' but the teachers were hesitant to teach him,' she explained. 'But then we found a teacher who used to be a concert pianist who became paralyzed in one arm and could only use two fingers on one hand. She said if she could play with two fingers she could teach Landon to play with three.'

The Bonneville High School student now visits elementary schools in the area to show off his skills and encourage others to take up the piano.

'Their jaws are on the ground and they can't believe what they're seeing and hearing,' his mother added.

'As a mother, I did whatever it took to help Landon find success in life,' she told the Standard Examiner.

'I knew it wouldn't be easy, but I knew that he was sent to me for a special reason, and I was determined to help him reach his full potential.'

And aside from playing the piano he has also mastered the drums and likes to drive.

'I have hundreds of piano books. My favorite composer is Jon Schmidt, because he lives in Utah and he's very good,' he told the local paper. 'And my mom lets me out of housework if I play the piano, so that's a big plus.'

In China piano player Liu Wei, who lost both his arms in an accident, won China's Got Talent by playing piano using only his toes.

He said of his passion: 'There are only two paths in my life for me â€“ either to die as fast as possible, or to live as brilliant a life as I could.'
