Different regions of the country have very alternative ways of expressing their feelings, according to a new study.

London is the flower capital of the UK, with over a third of Londoners having bought their partner a bouquet in the past year to maintain a blossoming relationship.

The Scots put faith in their loved 
one's sweet tooth: 29 per cent have surprised a partner with the reliable chocolate box gesture in the last year.

In Northern Ireland, the failsafe romantic meal is favoured by over two fifths, who have cooked a gourmet dinner as a way of showing affection towards their other half.

The Welsh eschew all other niceties and prefer to make a straight play for passion, with an overnight stay in a hotel proving the most popular gesture.

In stark contrast, East Anglians believe flattery will get you far - making East Anglia the compliment capital of the UK. Nearly a half of residents in the East Anglia region rely on compliments to show their loving side.

Helping out with everyday chores is the secret for romantic success in the South East with over one in five choosing to help their partner with household tasks.

The title for the least romantic 
location in the UK goes to Yorkshire. Nearly a third (34 per cent) of 
Yorkshire’s residents haven’t done anything romantic for their partner 
in the past year.

Keeping the romance alive in a long-term relationship is no mean feat but the survey has revealed the perfect formula for a successful relationship.

The survey, which questioned couples over 45 in long-term relationships, found that listening to your partner (39 per cent), spending time together (29 per cent), making sure you never go to bed angry (17 per cent) and making sure you give each other space (15 per cent) keep the romance alive long-term.

A spokesperson for Warner Leisure Hotels, who commissioned the survey, said: 'It's clear that each region has a different way of saying I love you.

'Relationships and romance require quality time together, trying new things as a couple and investment, but it’s the small things, such as cooking a meal or going on a spontaneous trip for the weekend, that really do make the difference. 

'No matter your age, or where in the country you live, it’s always important to make your partner feel special.'
