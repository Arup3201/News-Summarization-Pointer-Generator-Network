A primary school teacher awaiting sentencing for beating up his former girlfriend is receiving taxpayer-funded sick pay, it emerged yesterday.

Matthew Shadbolt, 32, has pleaded guilty to assaulting mother-of-three Carly White at her home and is to be sentenced next month.

It was after their relationship had lasted two years that the attack took place, leaving the university student with severe bruises to her arms and legs.

Yesterday she spoke out to alert parents of schoolchildren to his conviction for violence and the possibility of Shadbolt going back to teach at Rise Park Primary School in Nottingham. 

A spokesman for the school said it was inappropriate to comment but confirmed that Shadbolt remained on long-term sick leave.

Miss White, 31, from Giltbrook, Nottinghamshire, said: ‘It is a bit strange how he is still on sick pay.’

Injuries: The university student was left with severe bruises to her arms and legs and today spoke out as a warning to other parents

Employment: Despite admitting the offence, Shadbolot is still receiving full, long-term sick pay

Argument: Miss White said the attack happened after the pair argued before a trip to visit a friend

She explained that she felt compelled to speak out.

‘I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if something happened to a child,’ she said.

‘I thought about it and decided I wanted to make sure this didn’t happen to anyone else.

‘I just feel, if I was a parent at that school, I would want to know about the conviction, to make an informed decision as to whether I felt this person is suitable to teach my children or not.

‘I am hoping to go into teaching myself so it is all close to my heart really,’ she added.

Miss White, who had met Shadbolt on dating website Plenty of Fish, said the attack happened as they argued before they set off from her home to visit a terminally-ill friend in Dorset.

She added: ‘My children were staying with their father at the time. We had just been alone in the house.

‘It was a frightening experience which left me shaken and afraid. The whole incident lasted for a few minutes.’

Miss White did not contact the police straight away. Instead a friend she had told about the assault contacted police on her behalf about two weeks later.

Shadbolt was subsequently arrested by officers. 

He appeared before Nottingham Magistrates’ Court where he pleaded guilty to one charge of assault by beating on September 3. 

He will be sentenced at the same court on October 15.

Shadbolt’s solicitor declined to comment.
