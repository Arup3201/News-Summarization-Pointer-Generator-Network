A medical examiner has testified saying he was unable to prove how the wife of a Mormon doctor charged with murder died, complicating an eventual decision by jurors in the case.

The medical examiner said that Michele MacNeill’s heart could have stopped beating because of a natural reaction to the toxicity of prescription drugs she was using following her recent face lift and latent heart disease.

'I didn't believe I had enough to justify homicide,' Todd Grey testified on Thursday about his finding in the case involving defendant Martin MacNeill.

Inconclusive: Medical examiner Todd Grey changed the report of Michele MacNeill's death so that it wasn't necessarily a natural causes but said that it was undetermined

Grey said an irregular heartbeat was the most probable manner of death, but he doesn't know what caused it.

A heart arrhythmia 'leaves no footprints' that can be detected by a forensic pathologist, he said.

While he did not directly state any alternative theories, the prosecutor laid one out for him, saying: 'If you were to learn that the defendant here drugged up Michele MacNeill, and convinced her to get into the tub, and held her down for a little bit and it caused her death, would that scenario be consistent with how Michele MacNeill may have died here?'

'Yes it certainly is possible,' Grey responded.

The assistant medical examiner who drew up the first report has since died, but Grey said that he purposefully made it more open-ended.

'You wonder is something else going on here, if there is motive,' he said of the case.

Grey's testimony came a day after one of Martin MacNeill’s mistresses testified that he once described how he could induce a heart attack in someone that would appear natural.

Anna Walthall said MacNeill told her over 'pillow talk' in 2005 that '`there's something you can give someone that's natural that's a heart attack that's not detectable after they have a heart attack.''

One of Grey's subordinates initially ruled that Michele MacNeill's 2007 death was natural from heart disease, and that she had high blood pressure and was developing myocardosis, or inflamed heart tissue that could have interfered with a normal heart rate or rhythm, he said.

Investigative findings prompted Grey to change the autopsy finding to undetermined - and to add that drug toxicity may have played a role.

Those investigative findings 'raised a question as to whether this was a simple, straightforward, natural death,' said Grey.

He wasn't asked to elaborate on the stand.

That said, the change to undetermined opened the way for the murder charge against Martin MacNeill.

Prosecutors have said he hounded Michele MacNeill to get cosmetic surgery, then knocked her out with painkillers, Valium and sleeping pills and left her to die in a bathtub.

For the first time in the trial, prosecutor Chad Grunander suggested that MacNeill 'held her down to cause her death.'

Defense lawyers argue she had a heart attack and fell into the tub.

Grey said he couldn't confirm that she drowned, but it is possible. He said her lungs were about twice their normal weight, possibly because they were saturated with fluid or blood congestion, 'but I couldn't use those findings alone to prove drowning.'

Emergency medics previously testified Michelle MacNeill expelled two or three cups of fluid from her mouth when they performed chest compressions. Still Grey said it wasn't clear if the water came from her lungs or stomach.

In addition to the medical examiner, the court also heard from one of MacNeill’s older daughters Alexis Somers. She first testified on Wednesday and continued on Thursday, when the prosecution tried to poke holes in her credibility.

They argue the Somers, who now uses her mother’s maiden name, has based her recollections of the events surrounding her mother’s death on her desire to seek revenge on her father.

She has not been shy in offering her opinion, saying explicitly why she was so determined to investigate her mother’s death.

‘Because I believe my father killed her,’ she said in court on Thursday.

During her testimony on Wednesday, Somers revealed that just days after Michele was found dead in the family's bathtub, she received a phone call from her father saying that he had found a nanny for her younger siblings.

She told the court that he started to say that the nanny's name was Jillian and she cut him off.

'You mean Gypsy Jillian Willis? I know that woman and I know that mom was worried about you having an affair with her and you are not to bring her into this home,' Alexis recalled telling her father.

'He got irate. He was screaming at me, "How dare you, how dare you accuse me?"'

The court had never been told that Michele had suspicions about her husband cheating before, but Alexis said that her mother had paid a service to track a phone number that her husband had been calling. That number was registered to Gypsy Jyll Willis.
