In spite of the fact the birthrate has climbed, nappy sales have fallen - particularly expensive branded diapers

Sales of nappies have plummeted as cash-strapped new parents have slashed their spending on the newest member of the family, according to a new report yesterday.

Despite the birthrate in Britain hitting a record level, the latest research shows that the demand for nappies has failed to enjoy an upsurge.

But the greatest impact has been felt by the big brands which have seen hefty reductions in sales as families switch to cheaper own-label nappies from discount store chains and supermarkets.

Trade magazine The Grocer reported 
yesterday that the bottom has well and truly fallen out of Britain's 
nappy market which is worth £473.8 million a year.

In the past 12 months, value has slumped 3 per cent with volumes down 3.9per cent.

Grocer
 said: 'What baby boom? We may have seen a 23 per cent hike in births 
over the past decade and the national birthrate may be at its highest 
point since 1971, but that has not stopped the nappy market from having a
 stinker.'

The report says that Pampers, the UK's biggest nappy brand, has continued to lose value and volume sales despite its biggest rival, Huggies, making a shock exit from the UK market in October 2012.

Pampers has sold a staggering 76.3 million (4.1 per cent) fewer nappies year on year. A spokesman for brand owner Procter & Gamble told the magazine: 'As we said this time last year, we knew own-label would present strong competition and this has been the case.' 

But popular discount store chains have cashed in on the demand for cheaper products and the report shows that own-label figures are up an impressive 37.3 per cent on volumes up 44.5 per cent.

Aldi says it had doubled sales of its own-label baby and toddler range this year, claiming a 15 per cent own-label share for nappies, which it claims puts it behind only Tesco and Asda.

Aldi also reports newborn nappy sales have risen 190 per cent in the past year helped by on-pack promotions, discount coupons in key parent and baby magazines and low prices.

We're starting to see a switch in mindset with mums and how they make their purchasing decisions,' said an Aldi spokesman.

'The tough economic climate has forced many to look at alternatives. Once brands were best but they now realise there is no need to pay a premium price for a good quality product.'

Fellow discounter Lidl has also been one of the most active store chains in new product development.

'We are experiencing a baby boom in the UK at the moment so this is the optimum time to be developing and expanding our range,' a spokesman said.

Other industry observers say that savvy parents are increasingly switching to online retailers such as Amazon for their nappies.
