Napoli head coach Rafael Benitez has pointed the finger at assistant referee Elenito Di Liberatore for his side's 3-1 defeat to Juventus on Sunday.

Benitez was fuming regarding one pivotal decision made by the linesman in the game at the San Paolo stadium.

With the contest tied at 1-1, Juve's Martin Caceres headed Andrea Pirlo's free-kick past Napoli goalkeeper Rafael to put the visitors ahead in the 69th minute.

Rafael Benitez was left incensed after he saw his Napoli side drop points to rivals Juventus 

However, TV replays show Caceres and team-mate Giorgio Chiellini were in an offside position and the goal should have been disallowed.

'Juventus are a very strong side, but it's not hard to see Chiellini's white shirt and especially that bandage on his head with Caceres behind him,' Benitez told the Italian press. 'Against Juve it is always like this.

'We were in the game but the offside goal changed everything and we had to chase again.'

Napoli could not find an equaliser and it was Arturo Vidal that wrapped up the win for Juve deep in stoppage time.

'We give credit to Juve because they have quality and work hard, which is why they have been winning the scudetto for three years and will win again,' Benitez said. 'Our anger comes from the fact we could not compete on level terms due to these errors.'

The loss, Napoli's first at home to Juve since 2000 and their fourth of the season, dropped Benitez' side to fourth place, one point adrift of third-place Lazio, who hold the last Champions League qualifying spot.

Napoli travel to Rome on Sunday to face Lazio at the Stadio Olimpico.
