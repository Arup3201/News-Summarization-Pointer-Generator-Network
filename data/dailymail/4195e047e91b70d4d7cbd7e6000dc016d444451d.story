Daphne Belt will do a triathlon every morning until she turns 75

As she nears the age of 75, when most pensioners would look forward to putting their feet up and dunking a digestive into a nice cup of tea, Daphne Belt is lacing up her running shoes and preparing to celebrate her birthday in her own indomitable fashion.

At just 5ft 2ins tall, this extraordinary human powerhouse is planning to undertake a triathlon on every single morning of the entire 75 days running up to her landmark birthday.

This means each day for two-and-a-half months leading up to 14 August 2014, Daphne will swim 1,000 metres in her local pool, ride eight miles on her bike and 'wind down' with a run of almost two miles along the seafront in Littlehampton, West Sussex.

Daphne's extraordinary challenge will raise money for her local children's hospice.

'I want to raise well over £1,000 for Chestnut Tree House - the only children's hospice in Sussex - and I'll nag everybody silly until I do,' she says with a twinkle in her eye.

Taking the easy option has never been on Daphne's agenda. Her core of inner steel has powered her through more than 250 triathlons and 18 'extreme' fitness endurance tests known as Ironman challenges.

Normally, such extreme challenges - undertaken in the searing heat of foreign shores and often amid perilous mountain terrain - are the reserve of 6ft-tall fitness instructors and soldiers from elite forces. But Daphne's neat grey crop, tiny frame and cheerful smile have become familiar fixtures on starting lines around the world.

She tirelessly raises money for charity, and says: 'I first went to visit the local children's hospice several years ago. I saw such sadness and love there, it moved me to tears. I thought "I've got to do everything I can for these brave children and their families." '

If she's not raising money for the hospice, Daphne is helping other adults - many of whom have lost their way and their confidence.

She tirelessly helps to teach women beginners to swim and hundreds of others to keep fit, and blazes a trail encouraging women and men over a certain age to get up from the sofa.

Watching Daphne sprint down the road it's hard to believe that 24 years ago she was so unfit she could hardly climb the stairs without becoming breathless.

Daphne, who lives with her antique dealer husband of 35 years, Stephen, says: 'I floated past my 40th birthday without being bothered at all. My daughter was grown up, and I enjoyed a quiet life with Stephen.

'But as I neared my 50th birthday, the impact of my age suddenly hit me. I thought 'Oh my goodness, it's half a century.' I imagined my life as a spiral staircase, with me sliding down. I remember thinking 'I've got to claw my way back up.

'My hobbies were reading, watching television and tinkering in the garden. I did no sport or keep-fit at all, and although I'm not tall, I weighed 11 stone. I joined a local gym and started to get a little fitter, but one day the manager came up and said 'I've never seen you on the treadmill.'

'I said firmly "Oh, I don't do running." But he persuaded me to jump on and run for the first time in my life. It was an extraordinary feeling. I felt as if my lungs were inflating for the first time.'

Daphne's story might have ended with sedate workouts at the gym – but then a young friend mentioned a triathlon.

Daphne leapt at the challenge. She says: 'I thought "that sounds rather jolly," so at the age of 51, I found myself taking part in my first triathlon, in Ringwood, Hampshire. I didn't think there was anything unusual about me taking part, but it caused a stir on the starting line, and I realised I was quite a bit older than the other ladies taking part.

'It simply made me all the more determined to prove myself. By the time I finished, I was hooked.'

Eighteen months and several triathlons later, Daphne, 53 at the time, was ready for a more extreme event - the ultimate Ironman challenge of a 2.4 mile swim, a 112-mile bicycle ride and finally a 26.2 mile run.

Daphne almost completed the Ironman Lanzarote in 17 hours. but collapsed just five miles from the finishing line - and immediately decided to sign up for another the following year.

She adds: 'They are tough, and at times I feel like my lungs are bursting. I suffer from asthma, so it can be a real challenge. When I feel I can't go on, I push one leg in front of the other - and overcome it. The feeling of exhilaration at the end is worth every moment of pain.'

She now tackles ten triathlons a year and runs for the British team.

'Someone said I should publicise my races, to encourage other women of my age group to get fit. I started doing little pieces for the local paper, and sure enough, more women began entering triathlons,' she says. 'Younger women often come up and say “I read about you and decided to try this for myself.”

'Just the other week, when I was competing in a triathlon, a man jogged past me and did a double take. He was red and sweating and he said 'You're the reason I'm suffering like this!' Apparently, he had seen a piece about me on the wall of his gym, and had thought 'If she can do that, so can I!'

For 12 years, she has also run free keep-fit classes for women who are complete beginners - working with them for eight weeks to improve their fitness and self-esteem.

Daphne says: 'I've helped more than 100 women of all ages improve their fitness and in some cases, it literally transforms their life.

Daphne has also coached a swimming group which included disabled athletes, and helped one friend with cerebral palsy who could hardly walk to take her first tentative steps on a track.

Daphne says: 'Gradually, she took her first running steps and it was fabulous to watch. Eventually, she completed her own triathlon. To see her delight was worth every second.'

In May this year, Daphne broke an arm, a foot and her hand in a fall in Italy. She says: 'I was so cross with myself. I was looking at Mount Etna in the distance when I put my foot in a hole in the ground and fell.'

'We had to hail a taxi and the driver took one look at me and said 'Hospital'. I said 'Oh no you don't!' I didn't want to be trapped in a hospital so far away from home.'

So she endured the pain until she returned home three days later. I was so fed up because it meant I couldn't train. So I challenged myself to write a poem every day, to put in a book and sell to raise money for the hospice.'

When the plaster came off, Daphne returned to her training and just one month later, represented Great Britain in the Triathlon world championships.

Daphne said: 'We're in our 70s, but we're young at heart and we have steel in our soul. Everyone my age is capable of making their mark and helping this world be a far nicer place'

Somehow Daphne also manages to care for her 93-year-old bed-bound mother-in-law. She says: 'I don't think that I am extraordinary, but I am part of an extraordinary generation - the absolute backbone of this country.

'We're in our 70s, but we're young at heart and we have steel in our soul. Everyone my age is capable of making their mark and helping this world be a far nicer place.'

With a spring in her every step, Daphne is an inspiration to us all.
