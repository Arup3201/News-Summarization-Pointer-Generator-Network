A Colorado man had three toes amputated after a 78-year-old veterinarian allegedly gave him medicine meant to treat cancer in dogs.

A veterinarian for 54 years, Francis Freemyer is accused of illegally treating at least one human with disastrous results. The animal doctor was cited by officials for rubbing Dermex, a salve used to treat skin cancer in dogs, on the man’s foot, causing it to become infected and resulting in the man losing toes. Freemyer denies the charges and insists that he only treats animals.

Dermex is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use on humans and is still in testing on animals, but Freemyer swears by the drug – he says it cured him of melanoma.

Denial: Fran Freemyer denies he ever treated humans, except for himself - when he rubbed dog medicine on his own melanoma

Cops allege the folksy animal doc was ‘very energetic about his confidence in his ability to fix the foot’ and applied the ointment to a 58-year-old man’s toes when he went to the Eldred Animal Hospital in June complaining of sore toes, according to a police report.

The man’s foot became severely infected, resulting in three toes being amputated at a local hospital, according to reports.

Authorities told local media that Freemyer admitted to treating the unidentified man in exchange ofr payment, but he has denied these claims in several interviews with local media.

‘I don't treat people,’ Freemyer told KMGH. ‘I treat dogs and cats and cows and horses and fish and snakes and all of those things, anything that comes in the door – except people.’

A veterinarian at the clinic since 1959, Freemyer told CBS Denver that he rubbed Dermex on a Jack Russell terrier named ‘Scooter’ to treat lesions on its back. The woman who owns the dog then decided there was too much medicine on the dog, scraped it off and gave it to a neighbour who rubbed it on his foot and went to the animal clinic for a follow up.

Ever the attentive doctor, Freemyer covered the man’s foot in plastic wrap so the dark brown dog liniment wouldn’t stain his sock.

‘He came and talked to me I said, 'hell, I don't treat people, but you've already put it on there,’ Freemyer told KUSA.

A follow up visit to a regular doctor resulted in the man being admitted to a hospital and his toes being removed after his infection made its way to the bone, according to KMGH.

Officials think there may be other humans Freemyer has treated.

‘This isn’t something that we run across every day and it is something that we would like to see if there’s other people out there that this person may have actually treated as well,’ a Greeley Police spokesperson told KDVR.

Freemyer sees it as a witch hunt, telling KDVR ‘this is just such, it’s such a crock of, well, anyhow… the doctor’s the one that’s after me. The guy with the foot is still a good friend.’

Not his first time at the rode: Freemyer has been previously cited twice for improprieties

The unidentified man refuses to cooperate with police, according to reports.

One local called the allegations ‘crazy.’

‘When I heard it I couldn’t believe it because I’ve know the man all my life and he doesn’t do that. He doesn’t do it because he knows his job,’ Ruth Allmer emphatically told KDVR.

Even crazier, Freemyer told KUSA that he cured himself of malignant melanoma by rubbing Dermex on his skin.

This is not the first time the animal doc has run afoul of regulators, he has been previously cited twice for indiscretions, according to Reuters.

The first citation was the result of Freemyer certifying he examined 13 greyhounds after only seeing 12, it resulted in a $1,500 fine.

The second violation came when Freemyer was found to have not properly kept a cat’s medical records, he was fined $250.

The veteran vet plans to fight the latest charges in court.
