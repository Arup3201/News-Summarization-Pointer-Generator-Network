Robin van Persie would pick fellow strikers Wayne Rooney and Radamel Falcao in his dream five-a-side Manchester United team.

The Dutchman has said he would pack his side with attackers but would not call on the services of United's record signing Angel di Maria or Spanish playmaker Juan Mata.

Van Persie, speaking to the club's official website, said: 'That’s a good question because you have to make a decision if you want to go with attackers or have a combination and you might need a goalkeeper!

'I will go for David [de Gea] in goal. I need one defender so I will go with Michael Carrick because he can play in both positions [defence and midfield], then I’ll go for strikers so Wayne [Rooney].

'I’m involved as well? I’m not on the bench?! So me, David, Michael, Wayne and… this is very hard because you have Juan [Mata], you have [Angel] Di Maria and you have Falcao... I’ll go for Falcao.'

Van Persie scored his seventh Premier League goal of the season in the 3-1 victory over Liverpool on Sunday.

The Dutchman will be hoping to add to his tally when United travel to Aston Villa at the weekend.
