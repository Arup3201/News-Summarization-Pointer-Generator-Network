Tickets for beach volleyball were among the fastest to sell out at London's 2012 Olympics, despite it being little-played in the UK - and it even attracted Prince Harry.

Audience members were quick to comment on - and photograph - the England team's enviably toned physiques - and now you can get the look because the likes of Zara Dampney and Shauna Mullin have launched a fitness class inspired by their sport.

Dubbed Volleybody, it is a high-intensity fitness programme inspired by the training regimes of the world’s best beach volleyball players.

Get the look: Members of Great Britain women's Beach Volleyball team, including Shauna Mullin and Zara Dampney (far right) have created a new fitness class based on their training regime called Volleybody 

The exercise class is the brainchild of Katie Taylor, a marketing manager who saw the potential of turning the British beach volleyball team's training regime into a fitness programme.

She teamed up with Olympians Zara Dampney and Shauna Mullin as well as Katie Eddy, a strength and conditioning coach, and Lucy Jones, a nutritionist and dietician.

'Volleybody is founded on the scientific training principles of a professional beach volleyball athlete’s physical programme, explains Taylor.

Jump to it: The classes cost £10 and the different exercises and drills aim to hone your body to perfection and boost fitness levels

'The exercises take inspiration from three core moves within a volleyball game - defending, hitting and blocking a ball.'

The class has broken down the team's training regime into simple moves, which focus on upper and lower body strength plus high intensity interval training.

The 45-minute class is packed with skipping, squats, lunges, burpees and ball skills.

The class is £10 and currently only available at Slice Studios in South West London but fitness programmes and video content can be downloaded online for £10 a month and the founders are hoping to roll it out across the UK soon.

Beach Volleyball made its Olympic debut at Atlanta 1996 and has since become one of the most popular spectator sports at the Games.
