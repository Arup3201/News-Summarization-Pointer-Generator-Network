Hull City owner Assem Allam has offered to give the club away for nothing if his last-ditch bid to rebrand their traditional identity fails.

During a 45-minute briefing at the KC Stadium, arranged of his own volition to make plain his future intentions, the 75-year-old also pledged to deliver Champions League qualification if his appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport is successful.

Since saving Hull from a financial abyss in November 2010, the Egyptian-born, locally raised businessman has ploughed £72million of his personal wealth into transforming them from a mid-ranking Championship team into FA Cup finalists and Europa League participants.

Assem Allam has announced Hull City Football Club is up for sale and has been for more than five months

There had been growing rumours Assem Allam wanted to sell Hull City and the owner confirmed the news

But, having been denied the chance to drop City from their traditional name to rename them as Hull Tigers by the FA five months ago, Allam is prepared to write off his investment.

‘I’m out means I’m out. I will give it away if the appeal fails and no buyer is found. My message is that if you don’t like Hull Tigers I go,’ Allam confirmed.

When the Allam family took over four years ago, the strategic plan included playing top-flight football this season, a feat that was achieved 12 months ahead of schedule.

Allam’s legal team are understood to have been working on the CAS appeal over the summer and it is expected to take up to three months to reach its conclusion. 

‘Nobody works forever. But I wanted to be here until I achieved my ambition of being in the top four. You will say that it’s a bit wide, a bit exaggerating,’ Allam said.

‘No, because if I told you three years ago there would be Premier League and FA Cup final, and all this, you would have thought it was a joke. Now I am saying I want to be top four. In a couple of years’ time you will find it’s not a joke, it’s a possibility — if I am still here.’

Allam’s frustration over the restriction on Hull’s global branding — he revealed that the club’s current shirt sponsorship with 12Bet is £1m a year less than had been agreed with another unnamed Far East company before April’s FA ruling kiboshed it — follows failure to secure the freehold for the ground from Hull City Council, blocking plans to build a hotel and house other commercial facilities on site.

‘There is a difference between Championship, League One, League Two and Premier League,’ Allam said.  

Hull City is for sale and has been for five months after Assem Allam announced the rumours were true

The name change was turned down on April 9 and Assem Allam put the club up for sale 24 hours later

‘Championship and below you are a local club. Gate receipts represent 60 per cent of total income. When you are Premier League you are no longer local, you are global.

‘So you act global, you don’t act local. At the moment, because we have no other income, I pay, as evidence of my commitment to the local community, but there is a limit and I have gone past that limit.

‘We stated earlier this year that the club would be for sale should our attempt to globally promote Hull Tigers as a brand name and playing name be blocked.

‘As a consequence of the FA’s decision on April 9, I announced, on April 10 that Hull City is for sale. I am using the wording Hull City now to show respect to the FA’s decision. This is in accordance with my decision 10 months ago that I would walk away within 24 hours. 

Assem Allam says Steve Bruce can have no sway over his decision because there's nothing to decide

Hull City Football Club was put up for sale less than 24 hours after the name Hull Tigers was denied

‘In actual fact it was 22 hours. When I say something I mean it. I don’t call bluffs. We have also begun the appeal against the FA decision via arbitration and we are hopeful of a positive outcome or that the FA reconsider their decision.

‘Until the conclusion of the appeal or the sale, whichever comes first, we will remain fully committed to the club, evidenced by the latest remarkable additions to our already very good team.’

Allam was referring to Hull’s £38.5m outlay on signings since the end of last season, including the record £10m recruitment of Palermo’s Uruguay striker Abel Hernandez, who could make his debut against West Ham next Monday.
