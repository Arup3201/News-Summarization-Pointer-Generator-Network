Britain’s drink-driving hotspots were revealed today - with a small town in Wales found to have the highest proportion of convictions for driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

The ‘Postcodes of Shame’ results were published by MoneySuperMarket, which analysed 11million car insurance quotes from the last 12 months to determine which postcode areas had the highest and lowest proportion of motorists with drink or drug-drive offences listed on their policies.

Llandrindod Wells emerged at the top of the table - an area in mid-Wales where the conviction rate was 1.98 offences per 1,000 drivers.

The second-worst area was Blackpool (1.85 offences per 1,000 drivers), followed by Crewe (1.81), Swansea (1.76) and Inverness (1.72).

The rest of the worst-offending top ten was Cardiff (1.71), Kirkcaldy in Scotland (1.70), Shrewsbury (1.70), Darlington (1.69) and Northampton (1.67).

By contrast, Londoners are least likely to have drink or drug-driving convictions per head of population.

London postcodes dominated the least-convicted table, with the East (E), NW (NW) and North (N) codes taking up the first three positions. The London E area had a rate of just 0.76 offences per 1,000 drivers.

Other than London and Greater London areas, the postcode districts with the lowest proportion of offenders included Bradford (0.81 per 1,000 drivers), Liverpool (0.90), Huddersfield (1.04) and Manchester (1.05).

Drink-drivers face a driving ban of at least 12 months, a fine of up to £5,000, and in some cases, a prison sentence of up to six months.

Yet the report says more convictions are appearing on insurance quotes with each offence adding up £350 to an annual car insurance premium when the driver does get his or her licence back.

The MoneySuperMarket report says: ‘The rate in the rural Welsh LD postcode is more than double the rate among motorists living in some Greater London postcodes. ‘

Another drink-driving hotspot: The second-worst area was Blackpool (1.85 offences per 1,000 drivers)

But it also notes: ‘The Scottish postcodes of Inverness (IV), Kirkcaldy (KY), Aberdeen (AB), Dundee (DD) and Galashiels (TD) also feature in the top 20, as do Welsh hotspots Swansea (SA), Cardiff (CF) and Newport (NP).’

The report says: ‘Drivers in Scotland – including English drivers crossing the border - should be aware that the legal limit for alcohol in Scotland is being reduced on December 5, 2014.’

* The figure gives the drink or drug-drive conviction rate per 1,000 drivers in area

The current limit is 80mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood; it will fall to 50mg. This effectively means that one drink could put someone over the limit.

The report also points out: ‘Looking at postcodes with relatively few convictions for drink and drug-driving, there is a proliferation of locations – 10 out of 20 – that are within the M25 and on the periphery of central London. This might be because the area benefits from good public transport.’

A further breakdown of car insurance convictions found motorists aged 20 to 24 are the most likely to have a drink and drug conviction on their licence, at a rate of 2.5 per 1000 drivers.

This compares to 0.7 per 1,000 for drivers aged 17 to 19 years old, some of whom are only just old enough to drink legally and learn to drive.

Male motorists are more than twice as likely to offend as women, with conviction rates at 1.7 per 1,000 male drivers, compared to 0.7 per 1,000 female counterparts.

Kevin Pratt, car insurance expert at MoneySuperMarket, sought to answer why offending rates were higher in some areas than others.

Capital roads: Londoners are least likely to have drink or drug-driving convictions per head of population

He said: ‘There are serious consequences for those caught breaking the drink and drug-driving laws. All right-minded people understand that drink or drug-driving is wrong.

‘In a rural location such as Llandrindod Wells it could be the lack of public transport and the misguided belief they won’t get caught. Or maybe motorists are driving the morning after the night before, when they still have excess alcohol in their system.

‘Whatever the circumstances, the fact remains that driving while over the limit is always illegal - there is simply no excuse.’

Mr Pratt noted: ‘Even after a ban is served, a conviction will see insurance premiums shoot up by an average £350 – which is more than the cost some people’ s policies in the first place.’

He added: ‘With five Scottish postcodes featuring in our top 20 it will be interesting to see what effect the new, lower drink-drive limit will have. Many drivers are already being caught and convicted for drink and drug-driving, and many more could get caught out by the change in the law.’

Peter Rodger, chief examiner at the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said: ‘It’s nearly 50 years since breathalysers were introduced yet incredibly there are still people drink-driving and putting lives at risk.

‘Motorists have to face the consequences of their actions. The message is really simple. If you are driving, don’t drink at all. If you are drinking, don’t drive at all.’

In 2013, Aberdeen (AB) topped the chart of over the limit drivers with a rate of 1.5 per 1000 drivers.
