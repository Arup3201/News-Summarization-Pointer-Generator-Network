When Sheridan Smith bounds onto the stage to belt out Merseybeat classics in Cilla tonight, her huge voice is sensational.

Watch the second part of ITV’s outstanding Cilla Black biopic and you’ll see an actress who can do everything — comedy, drama and song, all at the same time. Even the real Cilla says she’s envious of the performance — and over the weekend sent a bouquet of flowers to congratulate her.

This is a star so gifted and glamorous that major names from director Trevor Nunn and comedian David Walliams to Hollywood superstars Kevin Spacey and Dustin Hoffman have pleaded to work with her. Maggie Smith and Michael Gambon count themselves among her fans.

But there’s one person who refuses to be convinced by all this effusion. Sheridan Smith is terrified that one day soon the world will declare her a fraud.

‘I spend most of my time feeling like I’m totally blagging it through life,’ she admits. ‘I didn’t go to drama school. I just wing it. And I honestly do feel out of my depth.

‘So I keep my head down. I don’t want anybody to spot I’m not a real actor.’

When she collected an Olivier award for best actress in 2011, for her West End starring role in Legally Blonde, she blurted: ‘I don’t think I deserve to be here.’

Coming from other actresses, this might be just fishing for compliments. But the cracks in Sheridan’s self-confidence go much deeper, affecting not only her career but also her private life.

Single since parting four years from her last acknowledged boyfriend, Reg Traviss — Amy Winehouse’s former lover — she admits that at 33 she has started to feel an urge for motherhood.

But she cannot believe that, after so long living alone, with a demanding job and a passion for her pets (a pug called Barry Manilow, a Japanese Spitz named Trish, and Enid, a Chinese shar pei) any man could want to share his life with her.

‘I’ve become a crazy dog lady from Crouch End,’ she frets. ‘What man wants to take on three dogs as well as me? Dogs are more loyal than men. And they’re less trouble. I’m happy with the dogs.’

She claims that attempts at dating over the years have been less than successful. One man turned up for dinner wearing socks and sandals; another threw up drunkenly over her dress on the bus.

Not one of these dates amounted to much. There has been nothing to match her emotional two-year affair with her Gavin & Stacey co-star James Corden, which was intense and draining.

Sheridan has maintained a dignified silence about the trauma of their repeated break-ups, but Corden has been less coy. There were no half-measures in their life together, he says: it was always ‘true love or deepest heartbreak’.

‘She is an incredible actress,’ he wrote in his autobiography. ‘Unbelievably talented. Funny, and absolutely intoxicating to be around. I loved her more than I ever knew was possible.

‘Each time we got back together the love would be more intense; and then, of course, the break-up would be all the more heart-breaking.’

They finally split in 2009.

Sensitive, wary and unsure of herself, Sheridan may still be nursing wounds from this emotionally exhausting merry-ground of break-up and reconciliation.

Her lack of confidence seems at odds with her upbringing. She comes from a supportive and hugely affectionate family. When she was starring in Legally Blonde, her mother would organise buses to bring her friends and family to see the show. These were riotous excursions with everyone dressed in high heels and feather boas.

Her parents, Marilyn and Colin Smith, work as a country ’n’ western duo called The Daltons, and from the age of four Sheridan was singing on stage in the local clubs with them, standing on a stool so the audience could see her.

Even today, there’s nothing she enjoys more than an impromptu song with her family. While filming Cilla in Liverpool earlier this year, she joined her brother Damian’s band, The Torn, at a pub in Liverpool’s Penny Lane, to belt out a Dolly Parton classic, Working Nine To Five.

There was, however, heartbreak in this otherwise happy, noisy childhood. Her other brother Julian, ten years her senior, died from cancer when she was just eight. Sheridan has a tattoo on the inside of her wrist in his memory — a pair of angel wings with a halo.

The actress admits she finds the tragedy hard to talk about, but she has just finished filming The C-Word, a drama celebrating the life of her friend Lisa Lynch, who died last year after a five-year battle with breast cancer.

The role required her to shave her head — and, typically, she seized the opportunity to do something unpredictable. A week before she was due to go bald, she dyed it green, blue, pink and then purple — and turned up to the Baftas with a lurid mohawk.

She called it ‘liberating … I can enjoy all the different styles it will go through before I’m back to being me’.

This clash of extroversion and insecurity lies behind everything she does.

Even before she reached her teens, her talent was obvious. She went to dance classes near her home in Epworth, Lincolnshire — ‘right bang between Doncaster and Scunthorpe’.

Her secondary school drama teacher urged her apply to the National Youth Music Theatre, which led to her first major part, in the musical Bugsy Malone. She was Tallulah, the gangster’s moll played by Jodie Foster in the movie.

In 1997, aged 16, she moved to London, sharing a two-bedroom flat with five other young actors and singers.

One of Sheridan’s first jobs was at the prestigious Donmar Warehouse, in the Stephen Sondheim musical Into The Woods playing Little Red Riding Hood. Damian Lewis, later the star of Homeland, played the Wolf.

Sheridan admitted that until she turned up at the theatre for rehearsals, she’d imagined the show would take place in a real warehouse. It was an understandable mistake from a no-nonsense Northern lass who thought ‘RP’ stood for ‘Right Posh’ rather than ‘Received Pronunciation’.

With a fake tan and extensions plaited into her hair, she played Anthony’s (actor Ralf Little) girlfriend in the BBC sitcom The Royle Family. An eight-year stint in the raucous comedy Two Pints Of Lager And A Packet Of Crisps followed, also with Little, who became a long-term friend.

She began to fear she had been typecast, condemned to play ‘scrubs, chavs or slappers’ in sitcoms such as Benidorm and Gavin & Stacey, in which she played James Corden’s gobby, tracksuit-wearing younger sister.

But her career took a sudden upward swing with the West End smash Legally Blonde — as Elle, the madcap peroxide blonde who amazes everyone by becoming a top lawyer.

The demands of the role looked impossible, with 18 musical numbers and a frenetic plot. But Sheridan handled it with consummate brilliance. Two phrases cropped up again and again in the ecstatic reviews — ‘A star is born’ and ‘Much better than Reese Witherspoon in the film’.

This success alerted Trevor Nunn to her talent. He cast her in Terence Rattigan’s wartime weepie, Flare Path, at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 2011, and sensational reviews followed.

One night Dustin Hoffman came backstage and reduced her to tears of disbelief with his praise. To prove these were not empty words, he cast her in his first film as a director, Quartet, with Maggie Smith, Billy Connolly and Michael Gambon.

She went on to do Ibsen at the Old Vic, encouraged by the theatre’s artistic director Kevin Spacey, and starred as Titania in A Midsummer Night’s Dream opposite David Walliams as Bottom.

Sheridan lost her older brother to cancer when she was just eight years old. She recently shaved her head to film The C-Word, a drama celebrating the life of her friend Lisa Lynch, who died last year after a five-year battle with breast cancer

Yet she is still crippled by self-doubt. Following an appearance on Jonathan Ross’s chat show where he ambushed her with a family video of her on stage singing at nine years old, she tweeted: ‘Oh I can’t stop crying. Hate myself sometimes, just can’t be myself. I can only play characters. Wish I had more confidence when I’m being me.’

She has collected shelfloads of awards, including two Oliviers and a Bafta.

The acclaim seems to do nothing for her confidence, however. When she was presented with an honorary doctorate from the University of Hull, she said: ‘I’m thrilled — but I left school when I was 16, and all the graduates here today have worked so hard and thoroughly deserve their degrees. They make me feel a bit of a fraud.’

Perhaps one day Sheridan will learn to trust the judgment of others. In the meantime — though she might not believe it — the whole country thinks she’s just fabulous.
