They are arguably some of the most famous faces in the country.

But clearly someone thought these two policemen needed a who's who of the Royal family - and provided them with a gallery of pictures so they could double check the people attending the Queen's pre-Christmas lunch were invited.

Despite the high-profile guests, it looked-like a decision had been taken to keep the checks low-key and a paper sheet was being used for monitoring who was entering the Palace.

The method of checking off members of the Royal family on a paper copy is reminiscent of bouncers turning away partygoers at a nightclub.

The esteemed members of Her Majesty's family descended en masse to Buckingham Palace for a festive feast this afternoon..

It's a rare occasion which sees the entire Royal family gathered around the table. Only twice a year does the Queen summon the entire extended Royal Family to the Palace for her pre-Christmas dinner.

And while some would expect the distinguished guests to arrive in expensive cars driven by chauffeurs, Viscount Linley and his daughter took a far more humble approach to their mode of transport.

The beaming pair arrived in a tiny blue Fiat 500, with a pair of dice dangling from the rear view mirror.

Prince William drove his wife Catherine in for the dinner, but there was no sign of their only son Prince George

Catherine looked fresh-faced and rosy-cheeked as she arrived for the annual Christmas dinner for the Queen's extended family

Cheer up William, you're about to have Christmas dinner! The Prince and 
Kate drove to the feast, but the baby seat in the back of the car appeared empty

Prince William was all ears when Kate spoke to him as they drove to the central London palace

They were joined by other members of the Royal family including Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.

Kate wore a festive red coat while her husband, the second in line to the throne, looked smart in a blue suit and glasses as he drove them into Buckingham Palace.

However, there was no sign of the couple's son, Prince George, who is third in line to the throne. But a baby-seat could be seen strapped into the back seat's chair behind Prince William.

The Queen, who appeared to be wearing a peach jacket and a string of pearls, could be seen peering out of the window as she was driven into the palace.

Camilla looked all smiles as she was joined by her husband Prince Charles for the Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace

She will be dining with Prince Edward, Princess Beatrice and Katharine, the Duchess of Kent, along with other members of her large extended family.

Crowds braved the rain to line the path of the Mall in London to greet the Royal family, which included both immediate and extended relatives f the Queen.

While everyone else drove in and waved to the crowds from their seats, Prince Edwards chose a far more subtle approach to arriving - strolling in on foot in his wax jacket from the direction of Clarence House.

The Prince, who arrived an hour early, barely caught the attention of the crowds. Another pedestrian was Vice Admiral Sir Tim Lawrence, the second husband of Princess Anne.

While William and Kate drove themselves to the lunch, it was a far cry from their latest 'official engagements' car.

Prince
 William has recently added a Â£250,000 Bentley to his garages is likely 
to make him the envy of many fathers-to-be up and down the country.

The Flying Spur, which the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will use for high-profile official engagements, is one of the worldâ€™s fastest saloon cars with a top speed of 200mph.

Viscount Linley and daughter Margarita Armstrong-Jones were all smiles as they made a grand entrance in a tiny Fiat 500

A far more environmentally friendly way to travel: Prince Edward arrived on foot, as did Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Lawrence

Safety features include bullet-proof windows and super-hardened steel armour, contributing to its hefty three-ton weight.

One member of the family who was absent from today's festivities is Prince Harry.

The
 29-year-old Royal showed off his bushy facial hair during a tour of a 
South Pole research centre shortly before departing for the UK.

 Harry returns to Britain after finishing Walking With The Wounded's 
South Pole Allied Challenge, which saw him join a team of injured 
service personnel from the UK and two others from the Commonwealth and the US, for a charity trek across Antarctica.

Princess Beatrice was driven in like most of the other guests, but Prince Edward braved the rain to arrive on foot for the special meal

The Prince and Princess Michael of Kent were among the guests who got into the Christmas spirit today

Anne, the Princess Royal, looked all wrapped up in her car and wasbe joined by her relative the Duchess of Kent at the occasion

Lady Helen Windsor (right) glowed while Viscountess Linley (left) looked serious - perhaps because she had seen the tiny car her husband had used to drive in

Autumn Philips, the wife of Peter Phillips, who is the son of Anne, Princess Royal, also chose to sport a red outfit to the occasion while Sarah Chatto, the only daughter of the 1st Earl of Snowdon and Princess Margaret, chose a dark blue ensemble

While Prince Charles was probably expecting his photograph to be taken when he arrived at the Palace, he wasn't expecting it when a youngster asked him for a snap yesterday.

The schoolboy took a selfie of himself with Prince Charles after he asked the Royal for a picture during a visit to a church centre.

The young boy took the picture before security staff could intervene after he asked the Prince of Wales if he could take a photo.

The boy, a member of the Coptic Orthodox Church Centre, in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, took the opportunity to ask for a picture while Prince Charles was chatting to the congregation yesterday.

He said: 'I went up to him and said if I could take a photograph of him - and then well I didn't wait for the body guards to push me out of the way, I just took a picture.'

Prince Charles, who was wearing a navy blue suit and checked tie, is seen standing behind the boy, looking into the camera.

Say cheese! The young boy took the picture before security staff could intervene after he asked the Prince of Wales if he could take a photo
