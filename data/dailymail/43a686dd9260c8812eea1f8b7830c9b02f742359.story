One in ten under-25s think Elvis Presley or Paul McCartney wrote the words instead of Robert Burns, pictured

It happens every year. We get 12  months to learn the lyrics – but hardly anyone bothers.

Now three-quarters admit they will mime or make up the words when the clock strikes midnight tomorrow . . . and the time comes for Auld Lang Syne.

A poll found that some 37 per cent do not know a single line of Robert Burns’s piece, written in 1788.

Its provenance is equally mysterious to some, especially when it comes to the younger revellers.

One in ten under-25s think Elvis Presley or Paul McCartney wrote the words – whatever they may be.

In terms of tactics, 37 per cent of all those surveyed said they hum loudly when their musical knowledge lets them down.

Others prefer a more physical performance: a fifth attempt to prevent people from discovering their ignorance by distracting them with some vigorous arm-shaking while linking limbs during the seasonal sing-song.

Almost two-thirds were also stumped over the meaning of the song’s title, which roughly translates as ‘Times Gone By’.

Now three-quarters of respondents to a poll admitted they will mime or make up the words when the time comes to sing Auld Lang Syne on New Year's Eve

The survey, to mark the release of Warner Bros’ ensemble comedy New Year’s Eve, found 10 per cent typically gaze upwards through the duration of the song to avoid being detected.

A cowardly 5 per cent actually leave the room altogether.

Rather fittingly, the most commonly  misremembered lyric was: ‘Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind?’

Some scamps replace the line with: ‘Should old acquaintance be forgot, and something else that rhymes.’

In total, 2,105 adults responded to the poll commissioned to promote the Hollywood film, which features a string of stars including Halle Berry, Michelle Pfeiffer, Zac Efron and Sarah Jessica Parker.

Meanwhile, many people's celebrations are being adapted to deal with their financial worries, a survey has found.

More people are planning a big night in than the traditional big night out this New Year’s Eve, with many revellers staying indoors due to concerns about cash.

But this does not actualyl make for a cheaper evening, according to the Post Office Home Insurance New Year survey.

Nearly three quarters of people (74 per cent) will stay in this year, it found, up from 72 per cent who were planning to stay in last year and 55 per cent in 2007.

Money and cost are an important factor in deciding how to see in the New Year, with 14 per cent of people citing this as the main reason behind their plans.

But those choosing to party at home are set to spend an average of £95 on food and alcohol - amounting to double the £48 average spend for those planning on heading out to celebrate.

Post Office head of home insurance, Gerry Barrett, said: 'New Year’s Eve can end up being a costly night, and as our research shows bizarrely, it can be even more costly for those who plan to stay in.'

Mr Barrett said the survey of 2,016 UK adults showed people look set to be emulating diners in Channel 4 programme Come Dine With Me.

He said: 'Come Dine With Me fever is apparently gripping the nation as more people than ever plan to stay at home or hold dinner parties, but many hosts could see their bills mount up as they look to impress their friends.'

While the lyrics for Auld Lang Syne are attributed to Robert Burns, it is likely that he merely adapted the words of an old ballad.

Burns apparently sent a copy of the song to the Scots Musical Museum with the remark: 'The following song, an old song, of the olden times, and which has never been in print, nor even in manuscript until I took it down from an old man.'

The poet also wrote a letter to Mrs Agnes Dunlop, attaching his version of Auld Lang Syne, in which he comments: 'Light be the turf on breast of the heaven-inspired poet who composed this glorious fragment! There is more of the fire of native genius in it than in half a dozen of modern English Bacchanalians.' 

Some say the famous chorus actually dates from the middle of the 16th century, if not before

The phrase 'Auld Lang Syne' is also used in similar poems by Robert Ayton (1570–1638), Allan Ramsay (1686–1757), and James Watson (1711) as well as older folk songs predating Burns.

Contemporary Scottish poet Matthew Fitt uses the phrase 'In the days of auld lang syne' as the equivalent of 'Once upon a time...' in his retelling of fairy tales.

But for those who need to brush up for the big night...

Should auld acquaintance be forgot,  And never brought to mind?  Should auld acquaintance be forgot,  And auld lang syne!  CHORUS

For auld lang syne, my dear,  For auld lang syne.  We'll tak a cup o' kindness yet,  For auld lang syne. 

And to really impress here are verses two to five...

And surely ye'll be your pint stowp!And surely I'll be mine!And we'll tak a cup o'kindness yet,For auld lang syne.We twa hae run about the braes,And pou'd the gowans fine;But we've wander'd mony a weary fit,Sin' auld lang syne.We twa hae paidl'd in the burn,Frae morning sun till dine;But seas between us braid hae roar'dSin' auld lang syne.And there's a hand, my trusty fere!And gie's a hand o' thine!And we'll tak a right gude-willie waught,For auld lang syne.
