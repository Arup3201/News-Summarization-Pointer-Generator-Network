A mother thrown to her death from a Six Flags rollercoaster in July was sitting in a car operators knew to be faulty and wasn't properly restrained, according to a newly released police report.

Rosa Ayala-Gaona Esparza, 52, was ejected from her seat in the Texas Giant in front of her mortified daughter at about 6:40 p.m. July 19. Her partially severed body was found wrapped around a support beam on the roof of the Honky Tonk tunnel, with blood and tissue scattered over a 75-foot area.

According to The Houston Chronicle, the ride operator told Arlington Police Department investigators that he checked everyone's restraints before the train departed, but when it went by he remembered thinking the restraint wasn't all the way down on Esparza's thigh.

The theme park has denied a mechanical fault was to blame for the accident.

However, the harness was down far enough for the computer to register it as locked.

The police report also reveals that an investigator received an email from a woman who had ridden in car number 3, the car Esparza was riding in, the day before the fatal incident.

The woman said she was riding at about 6:30 p.m. and after the train had loaded, the operator announced 'all clear' over the loud speaker.

But he then immediately looked down and announced 'Check car 3.'

She explained that one of the employees who had previously checked the restraints came back to her car and rechecked the restraint.

Then came another 'all clear' announcement and the ride began.

A witness riding in the fourth row, directly behind Esparza, corroborated the claim that her restraint was not properly latched.

He told police both he and his friend tried to help the woman when they saw her feet in the air but they couldn't reach her.

Investigators interviewed 17 witnesses who either saw Esparza being flung from the car or only became aware of the tragedy after the ride came to a halt.

The woman's daughter, who is suing the theme park, was riding in the car ahead of her mother with her husband and turned around early int he ride to see her mother almost completely upside down in the car with her head at the floor.

As the ride began its third ascent, she saw her mother being tossed out of the car but didn't see her hit anything, the report states.

The daughter was then forced to endure the rest of the ride, not knowing her mother's fate.

It took fire fighters an hour to remove Esparza's body from the aluminum roof.

'The decedent's body was partially wrapped around support beam #471, with her lower body on top of the roof and her nearly severed upper body hanging over the south side of the roof,' one of the reports states, according to the Chronicle.

Reopened: The Texas Giant roller coaster ride in Six Flags Over Texas, pictured, reopened in September

In a statement to the newspaper on 
Monday, Six Flags said, 'Our hearts remain heavy about this accident and
 our sincerest condolences go out to Ms. Esparza's family.'

The theme park denies all allegations that it was at fault.

In
 October, Six Flags said in court documents that it was not responsible 
for the death because it was not the manufacturer or designer of the 
Texas Giant ride.

The theme
 park filed its response on October 4 in district court in Tarrant 
County to the wrongful death lawsuit filed by Esparza's family. 

The ride reopened in September.

The company said it followed maintenance and inspection procedures recommended by manufacturer Gerstlauer Amusement Rides.

It also pointed out that about 2.5 million people had been on the roller coaster before the incident.

Six
 Flags announced in September that the notorious 153-foot tall roller 
coaster was to reopen with new seat belts and redesigned restraint bar 
pads following an internal investigation.

While the company maintains a 
mechanical failure was not to blame for Esparza's tragic fall, her family have 
accused the park of negligence and operating a faulty ride.

The $1 million lawsuit, filed in September names Six Flags 
Entertainment Corporation, Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc, Texas Flags, Ltd.
 and Six Flags Over Texas as defendants.

Ominous: Witnesses said they heard Rosa Esparza complain about her harness before she fell

According to the suit, Esparza, who 
also went by the surname Ayala-Gaona, was in the front left 
seat of the train's second car behind her daughter and son-in-law.

The 
car had no seat belt or shoulder harness, only a single lap or 'T-bar'
to restrain passengers, Star-Telegram reported.

'As the roller-coaster was in its first 
large descent, Rosa Esparza's daughter heard screaming and yelling 
behind her, and turned to see her mother in the process of being thrown 
out of the car, out from behind the safety in her seat,' the suit 
states.

Esparza was then thrown against a support piling as the car twisted and turned, landing on the tunnel's roof.

'She was then catapulted many feet below
 onto the metal roof of a tunnel,' the lawsuit states.

Before the mother of two fell about 
75 feet, witnesses said she had complained her harness wasn't fastened securely.

'They didn't secure her right. One of
 the employees from the park â€” one of the ladies â€” she asked her to 
click her more than once, and they were like, 'As long you heard it 
click, you're OK.' Everybody else is like, 'Click, click, click.' ' a 
witness told The Dallas News.

'Hers
 only clicked once. Hers was the only one that went down once, and she 
didn't feel safe, but they let her still get on the ride.'

Devastating: Esparza's family is suing Six Flags Over Texas for negligence after the tragic accident

The suit states Esparza's daughter and son-in-law were forced
 to complete the ride for 'what seemed like an interminable time knowing
 that Rosa Esparza had been thrown out of the ride and not knowing 
whether she was dead or seriously injured and in need of immediate 
medical attention'.

It also claimed Six Flags employees initially refused to believe that Esparza had been thrown off the ride.

'It's a tragedy of the highest order,' Dallas attorney Frank Branson, who filed the suit on the family's behalf, told Star-Telegram. 'I believe it should have been 
avoided and could have been avoided.'

Following a nearly two-month investigation by the
 'ride train manufacturer, internal engineers and external experts', the
 Texas Department of Insurance gave the park approval to start up the 
ride again.

Six Flags officials said it has now added 'incremental and overlapping safety measures' to the ride, including re-designed 
restraint-bar pads from the manufacturer and new seat belts.

The park is also now providing a coaster ride seat at the entrance to allow guests 
with 'unique body shapes and sizes' to see if they fit in the restraint.

'We are heartbroken and will forever 
feel the pain and sadness of this tragic accident,' Steve 
Martindale, president of Six Flags Over Texas, said.

'The safety of our guests
 and employees is our company's absolute highest priority and we try to 
take every reasonable precaution to eliminate the risk of accidents.'

Martindale and his family were among the first riders when it reopened in September.

The Esparza family's suit says Six Flags
 operators have known for decades the extreme dangers posed by
 such rides.

This was the park's second fatality. In 1999, a 28-year-old Arkansas woman 
died and 10 others were injured when a boat capsized on the Roaring 
Rapids ride.

In 2006, 
nine park patrons were injured on the Texas Tornado when one of the 
mechanical bearings that spins the ride malfunctioned.

'More often than not, the response of 
the Six Flags defendants to roller-coaster tragedies at their parks has 
been merely to feign surprise and to belatedly add safety belts in an 
attempt to calm the public's fears,' the lawsuit states.

Star-Telegram also reports the suit states that inspections done on
 the roller coasters since Esparza's death 'showed that various parts of
 the security systems on the ride were experiencing inconsistencies and 
intermittent failures.'

'In addition, Six Flags has now admitted
 that, after these inspections, they replaced a 'limit switch' for a 
restraint in the very car in which Rosa was riding because Six Flags 
found the switch to be defective,' the suit states.
