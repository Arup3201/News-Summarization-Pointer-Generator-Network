A scorned woman was so furious at her cheating lover she recruited a removal firm to strip his flat bare - including the carpets.

Corrina Finney, 39, was heartbroken when she caught Brian Waite cheating for the third time after spotting his photo on a dating site.

In revenge the mother-of-two persuaded a removal van driver to help gut his flat while he was out.

She took all his furniture, electrical equipment, bed, and even his clothing and toiletries - leaving just the underlay for the carpets.

Mr Waite returned in the evening to find the interior of his flat 'looking like a new build'.

Finney was quickly tracked down by the police and has now admitted a charge of theft at Swindon Magistrates Court in Wiltshire.

But the defiant mum has refused to apologise - and said she is glad that Mr Waite 'got what he deserved.'

She said: 'I am not sorry. My solicitor told me to say I was sorry but I’m not - I am only sorry I didn’t do it sooner.

'I was heartbroken. This was a man I loved for 10 years. I want everybody to know what this man has done.

'Now I have my revenge. He got what he deserved. I am no longer a victim, I am a survivor.

'If it wasn’t for the help of my friends and family I wouldn’t be here today.'

Finney, from Redhouse in Swindon, pleaded guilty to stealing from her ex-partner’s flat in the Moredon area of the town on March 14.

The court heard she was devastated after catching Mr Waite, 63, advertising himself on website Mature Free and Single, and opted to get revenge.

Vivian Thatcher, prosecuting, said: 'For 18 months he [Mr Waite] has known the defendant and has been in a relationship with her. In total they have known each other for about ten years.

'He describes their relationship as being generally good and he says that he got on well with the defendant’s son and daughter as well.

'She has always had a key to his flat and has been free to come and go as she pleased.

'On March 14 he left in the morning at about 7.45am and he returned at about 8.15pm. He went in and the flat was empty. It was completely absent of all items.

'Only the underlay was left. The victim said it was as though it was a new build.'

The police were called and Corrina’s house was searched but officers could not find the stolen belongings.

The court was told the value of the stolen items were unknown and that most were recovered by police with the help of the removal man.

Only some clothing and other items remain outstanding.

Will Woodman, defending, said: 'This is a case of a woman scorned and I understand this was the third time on which Miss Finney’s partner had slept with someone else.'

The case was adjourned for psychiatric and pre-sentence reports and Corrina was released on bail. She will appear before the court on May 12.
