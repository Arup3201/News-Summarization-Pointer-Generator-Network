Princess Beatrice attended a basketball game at Madison Square Garden yesterday, where she watched the Atlanta Hawks take on the New York Knicks.

But the Duchess of York's daughter didn't appear to enjoy her experience of the American basketball match.

Sitting next to Gossip Girl actress Michelle Trachtenberg, 28, the British royal, 23, tapped her feet and covered her face with her hands as she looked on.

But her sombre appearance may be down to her missing loved ones back in Britain.

Eugenie is now almost three months into a new job with online auction house in Manhattan.

She is separated for the first time from her family and long-term
 boyfriend Jack Brooksbank, 27, and friends say she was initially 
apprehensive about the move, as she had few close friends in the city.

But Jack, who visited Eugenie in October, says despite the 3,500 miles between them the couple speak to each other as often as ever.

'We spend a lot of time on Skype,' he says. 'It's great. We are still very much together.'

Eugenie is based
 in a stylish apartment in the trendy Meatpacking District of Manhattan 
and is now said to be 'making the most' of her time in New York.

But
 while she she was dressed impeccably in a chic embellished jumper, the 
Royal appeared uncomfortable and out of place among the otherwise 
cheerful crowd at the game.

Gossip Girl star Michelle Trachtenberg laughed and joked with her companion as she posed for pictures.

Meanwhile, affectionate couple
 Olivia Munn and Joel Kinnaman wrapped their arms around each other as 
they sat courtside.

A cheerful Christie Brinkley also attended the match with her son.
