Spanish officials treated EU inspectors to a slap-up lunch today before taking them to the border with Gibraltar to highlight their concerns about smuggling.

European Commission experts spent the first part of their fact-finding mission in the Rock gathering information on border queues that have sparked a diplomatic row between Britain and Spain.

But they enjoyed Spanish hospitality ahead of their afternoon the other side of the border in the town of La Linea.

Border queues have been causing diplomatic tensions as Gibraltar citizens claim they are in retaliation for trying to build an artificial reef in disputed waters

Spanish foreign ministry officials took them to an upmarket restaurant called Aqa overlooking the sea.

They kicked off with an aperitif before tucking into plates of Russian salad, fried squid, a cold garlic-heavy tomato soup called Salmorejo and tuna kebabs.

The special menu included a lemon sorbet dessert. Most of the party stuck to water although beer was provided.

Police guarded the entrance to the restaurant opposite the Rock as the group were escorted to a cordoned-off first-floor dining area.

The inspectors, who are looking at border and customs controls, spent around an hour and a half at the 'working lunch' before getting back to business on the ground.

Tensions over Gibraltar have been rising since Spain's ruling Popular Party swept to power in elections nearly two years ago.

They reached boiling point last month after Gibraltar dumped 70 concrete blocks into the sea off the airport to stop Spanish fishermen entering their waters.

Spain reacted by increasing checks on cars with the claim they were targeting cigarette smugglers and money launderers - forcing people to wait up to seven hours to cross the border from Gibraltar.

However Spanish officials says they are necessary to stop smuggling and have nothing to do with disputes over Gibraltar's sovereignty

The Rock's chief minister Fabian Picardo branded the Spanish government 'neanderthal' and accused it of acting like communist north Korea after its foreign minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo threatened to charge motorists Â£43 a time to cross the border.

The European Commission agreed to send a fact-finding mission to the area after complaints from locals, MEPs and the Gibraltar government over the checks on traffic entering and leaving the Rock.

Spain has insisted its checks are vital to tackle the scourges of cigarette smuggling and money laundering.

Experts from areas including customs, justice and anti-fraud took part in today's trip.

A European Commission spokesman said: 'The Commission will carry out an assessment on the basis of the information obtained during the visit and the information already provided.

'Based on this assessment, the Commission will decide if further action is necessary.

'Lunch was a working lunch and I don't see where the inspectors had lunch as a big deal. It's a long day and they had to have lunch.

'They had coffee on the Gibraltar side in the morning and from then on it was a question of timing.

'Spain is a big country with more administrative layers than Gibraltar so the Spanish side of the visit required more time.'
