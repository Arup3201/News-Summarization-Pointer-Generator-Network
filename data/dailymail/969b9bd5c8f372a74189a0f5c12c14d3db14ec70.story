The Czech Republic's top celebrity website have claimed British women are not beautiful using the winner of the Miss Great Britain beauty pageant as a prime example.

The website Extra.cz claimed that Shelby Tribble, 21, from Plymouth, was not good-looking enough to told the title of a beauty queen.

They felt so strongly about Shelby's appearance that they went as far as to pixelate out her face on their site.

Rude: Czech gossip website Extra.cz blurred out Miss Great Britain winner Shelby Tribble's face 

Miss Great Britain: But a Czech website described Shelby as an 'ordinary, regular, non-interesting blonde' and said she 'proved the rule that British women are not beautiful'

The Czech gossip website said traffic for their articles about the Miss Great Britain beauty contest had gone through the roof after they declared the winner was not good looking.

In one of the first reports they included the headline: 'Great Britain has new Miss and she proves the rule that British women are not beautiful.'

It included the pixelated photo of Shelby, who has won a number of beauty queen titles in the UK. As well as being crowned Miss Great Britain 2014/15, she has also been crowned Miss South West, Miss Hippodrome 2014, Miss Loaded 2014 and has been a Miss England finalist.

Facing adversity: The 21-year-old said competing in pageants has help rebuild her confidence after being bullied at school

But the Czech article concluded that if she was to take part in a Czech beauty pageant, she would not even make the finals.

Publishing photos of the other Miss Britain contestants, it said: 'Ordinary, regular, non-interesting blonde beats approximately 40 competitors. If you want to know why look no further than this gallery.'

And it pointed out that there was no surprise that famous British women like Emma Watson, Kate Middleton, Kate Moss, Cara Delevigne, Keira Knightley and Kate Winslet had decided to steer clear of the UK event.

Shelby, here competing in Miss Great Britain as Miss South West before she won, has not always been so self confident 

It said: 'It seems that the really beautiful British women that the UK produces prefer to invest the time in a career, leaving the beauty contests to the rest.'

In the Czech Republic, they said, beauty contests were at whole new level because they actually had women that were worth looking at.

They said: 'It's not really a surprise, hear in the Czech Republic it is an interesting event. The show is broadcasted live on national TV and the winner becomes a famous celebrity.

'But look at the British event, no celebrity guests, no four-hour-long show and most importantly, no beautiful girls.'

Exceptions: The article describes Englishwomen Emma Watson and Kate Middleton as two of the most stylish women in the world and questions why British beauty contestants are so 'ordinary' 

The story, which was a viral hit for the website, was then developed with further stories including one that said: '10 finalists for the English Miss contest that will make your eyes water. Such monsters are hard to find!'

The author then admits that they deliberately chose the ugliest but points out that they were nevertheless staggered that they ever made it even to the final.

It said they had no dress sense, cheap shoes and relied on revealing intimate body parts rather than real natural beauty in order to win votes. 

Shelby, whose story was published on MailOnline this week, is no stranger to facing cruel taunts.

She describes herself as 'painfully shy' after being bullied at school and had to overcome low self-esteem in order to triumph as a beauty queen.

She said competing in beauty pageants and modelling has helped her turn the tables on her tormentors and gain a sense of self worth.
