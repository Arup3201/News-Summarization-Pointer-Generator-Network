One in ten police officers are being sent out on duty with a potentially lethal Taser stun gun, it was revealed last night.

Almost 14,000 frontline officers are allowed to wield the 50,000-volt devices, which they are given after just three days of training.

The figure lays bare how forces are increasingly relying on the weapons, which they claim make officers and the public safer. And it raises fresh questions about whether British police are being 'armed by stealth', endangering almost two centuries of policing by consent.

Potentially lethal: Figures show one in ten police officers are allowed to carry Tasers after just three days training

Critics claim the American-made weapons are increasingly being used to force people to obey police, simply by threatening them.

But one police chief said the training officers received was 'world-class' and Tasers were less dangerous than conventional firearms, batons and dogs.

Fatal burns: Controversy rages over the death of Andrew Pimlott after he was Tasered while soaked in fuel

The news came as controversy rages over the death of Andrew Pimlott after he was Tasered while soaked in fuel.

The 32-year-old succumbed to horrendous burns after a confrontation with police outside his home in Plymouth, Devon. The independent police watchdog is investigating the incident.

A total of 13,794 officers are trained to use Taser stun guns, which were introduced in 2004. There are 132,235 police officers in England and Wales.

To be able to carry a Taser, officers undergo a three-day training course and renew their accreditation each year via the internet.

The training course includes classroom-based lessons and practical testing, including a scenario with a man holding a can of petrol and a cigarette lighter.

One Taser critic claimed the weapons have been put into the hands of non-firearms officers without any clear debate or political decision.

Richard Taylor, who is based in Cambridge, said: 'I don’t think any element of a UK police officer’s power and authority should come from the weapons that they are holding.’

Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman said there was 'pressure’ for even more of the weapons to be made available.

The West Mercia officer, who is responsible for Taser use nationally, added: 'Mistakes will be made because there is a human element to all this. We feel it is often by far the safest and least injurious weapon to use.'
