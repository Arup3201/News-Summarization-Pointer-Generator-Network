A job advert for a council-owned company says it would be an advantage to speak Polish – in Wales.

The £6.50-an-hour jobs are for 'recycling operatives' at waste company Cwm Environmental, in Carmarthen, which is owned by Labour-led Carmarthenshire County Council. 

The advert says: 'The ability to speak and understand Polish is an advantage but not essential.'

There is no mention of speaking Welsh.

Council-owned waste management company Cwm Environmental in Carmarthen, Wales, has put out a job advert in which it states: 'The ability to speak and understand Polish is an advantage but not essential'

However, 30 of Cwm's 100 workers are from Eastern Europe, mostly Poland.

Cwm said it made sense for them to be able to communicate in Polish for health and safety reasons.

The council said the firm was entirely responsible for recruitment. But Welsh Tories said local workers were being disadvantaged.

A spokesman for the Welsh Conservatives said: 'This is an extraordinary attempt by a Labour-run council to recruit migrant workers, at the likely expense of local jobseekers who speak English or Welsh.

'Ed Miliband promised to ban recruitment agencies which try to undercut local wages by hiring only migrant workers, yet here is a Labour-led council aiming a job advert at Polish speakers - with such rank hypocrisy, it's no wonder voters can't trust Ed Miliband on immigration.

'Putting local workers at a competitive disadvantage and exploiting foreign workers is clearly beyond the pale.'

Official figures show more than 40 per cent of the population of Carmarthenshire speak Welsh as well as English - but there is no mention of speaking Welsh in the advert.

A spokesperson for Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru said: 'We are saddened that the council does not always place the same emphasis on the need to be able to communicate through the medium of Welsh when delivering public services.'

The council insists it has no involvement in the everyday running of the company.

John Rees, managing director of Cwm, said: 'We are an arms' length company and the council could not interfere in operational matters like recruitment policy.

'Around 30 of our 100 workers are from eastern Europe, the great majority from Poland. They are very good and reliable workers.

'There are health and safety considerations and it makes sense for workers to be able to communicate in Polish.'
