Ed Miliband insisted shadow Chancellor Ed Balls will not be sacked before the election – but failed to guarantee him in his job after 2015.

Amid reports that Labour MPs are increasingly unhappy with the performance of the abrasive Mr Balls, the Labour leader dismissed speculation that he could be replaced by former Chancellor Alistair Darling or shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves.

‘Ed Balls is doing a really good job and, absolutely, I’ve said that he’s going to be the shadow chancellor going with me into the election,’ Mr Miliband told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme.

Insists: Mr Miliband told Andrew Marr the shadow chancellor will keep his job until at least 2015

However, observers asked why the Labour leader had not gone further, and pledged that Mr Balls would serve as Chancellor in a Labour government.

Some speculated that Mr Miliband might want to keep the option open of putting someone else in charge of the Treasury - possibly Business Secretary Vince Cable in the event of a Lib-Lab coalition.

The Labour leader added: ‘People have their critics.

'The thing I’d say to you about Ed Balls: he’s got a clear sense of what this economy needs, he’s working with me on tackling the cost-of-living crisis that we face and he’s got the toughness to stand up to lots of people who want more spending when actually it’s going to be tough for Labour.’

Yesterday, an Opinium poll for the 
Observer found that just 18 per cent believe Mr Miliband and the shadow 
Chancellor would be the best custodians of the economy.

Concerns: Labour MPs are said to be increasingly unhappy with Ed Balls' abrasive performance

An anonymous Labour MP was reported as complaining that Mr Balls had ‘lost his mojo’.

‘Balls used to throw his weight around in shadow cabinet meetings and ignore Ed Miliband when he spoke,’ the MP said.

‘Now
 Balls is totally out of sorts. He doesn’t say much at shadow cabinet 
meetings and when he does, he is the one who is ignored. He has lost his
 mojo.’

Last week, Mr Balls dismissed speculation over his future in the shadow cabinet as ‘tittle tattle’ and insisted he has a ‘very good relationship’ with Ed Miliband.

The shadow chancellor, whose response to the Autumn Statement last month was widely criticised, was not mentioned in a major speech by the Labour leader, prompting further questions about the security of his position.

Candidates? Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rachel Reeves and former Chancellor Alistair Darling

‘If you are a grown up in politics then you don’t take that kind of tittle tattle seriously at all,’ Mr Balls said.

‘I’m the person who is going to make sure we have sound public finances but also have fairness in our labour market, fairness in our tax system, preserve our National Health Service and have competition in banking in our economy to tackle the cost of living crisis and every day I’m going to work hard to do my job for the benefit, not of the Labour party, but for the British people.’

Conservative party vice chairman Bob Neill said: ‘It’s clear Miliband hates Balls but he’s too weak to move him.

‘Every time he praises him he does so through gritted teeth. Every single call Balls has made on the economy has turned out to be wrong. The only thing he and the Labour Party stand for ate more borrowing, more spending and higher taxes.’
