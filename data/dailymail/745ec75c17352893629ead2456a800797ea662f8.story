Neil Warnock’s impact was evident, quite literally, from the first minute until the last.

First there was a goal inside 31 seconds on his return to the dugout and then Wilfried Zaha - brought back to Selhurst Park by the new boss on Friday - salvaged a point in the fifth minute of stoppage time after a breathtaking finale at St James’ Park.

Old boys they may be, but Warnock and Zaha will have a major say in a new era for the Eagles.

For Zaha, it is about rebuilding a reputation damaged by a season in the shadows at Manchester United after his £15million move last summer. Warnock, meanwhile, wants to ‘pay back’ the club some four-and-a-half years after leaving for Queens Park Rangers.

Both he and his opposite number Alan Pardew could make a case that their side deserved to win this pulsating contest.

Palace flew out of the blocks as Dwight Gayle netted inside the first minute. Pardew’s men equalised through Daryl Janmaat - their first league goal of the season - before Jason Puncheon restored the visitors’ advantage just after half-time.

But 18-year-old substitute Rolando Aarons headed the hosts level before he assisted Mike Williamson for what appeared to be the winner two minutes from time. Zaha, though, had other ideas.

And Warnock said: ‘You can’t ask much more than what they gave me. They played like I thought they could.

‘The one thing I love about football is when you’ve got a group of players who want to come in and train, want to tackle, want to put their heads in. So for however long it lasts I’m going to enjoy it.’

On point-saver Zaha, he added: ‘I said to him “smile a lot”. He’s not being playing much and if he enjoys himself he’ll be a threat in this league. It’s a big season for him’.

Meanwhile, Pardew reflected: ‘We’ve conceded a goal after 30 seconds and straight after half-time, but have come back each time.

‘We then got carried away when we took the lead. It was at a time in the game when we should have seen it out. Zaha is a player that we’ve talked about here and admired him, so it’s more galling that he’s scored the equaliser.’

All the attention before the game had been on Warnock and Newcastle midfielder Jack Colback, signed on a free from rivals Sunderland, who was included in Roy Hodgson’s England squad this week.

But it was Aarons - called up to the Three Lions Under-20 set-up for the first time on Thursday - who threatened to steal the headlines until Zaha’s last-gasp intervention. Gayle’s close-range opener was cancelled out when Janmaat poked in via a deflection before half-time, only for Puncheon to volley an emphatic second for the visitors after the break.

Newcastle were short on ideas until the introduction of Aarons and he sprung highest to head home from a Remy Cabella corner, bringing parity and relief to St James’ on 73 minutes.

And it was his trickery and cross-cum-shot which allowed Williamson to stab in his first for the club after the ball had rebounded off the upright.

Pardew said: ‘There are times when we’ve come up against packed defences and it’s difficult. You just need that sub to make the impact and Rolando certainly did that today.

‘I have given a lot of good players their debut - Mark Noble, Jonjo Shelvey, Alex-Oxlade Chamberlain among them - and he’s up there with them. He’s got something about him.’

But it was Zaha who stole the show at the death, much to the annoyance of Pardew.

‘They came here and wasted time from the first minute. They are then 3-2 down and they get seven minutes added time - in the spirit of the game I thought that was wrong,’ he said.

On the subject of spirit, Warnock had no complaints.

‘Tony (Pulis) must have done a fantastic job,’ he said. ‘Because they’ve got a great camaraderie here.’
