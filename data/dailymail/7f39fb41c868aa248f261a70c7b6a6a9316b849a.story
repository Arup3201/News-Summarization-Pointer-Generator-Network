The House of Representatives on Friday passed legislation giving the makers of the Keystone pipeline the go-ahead to build the fourth and final section of the oil transportation system. 

The House has already sanctioned the construction of the XL portion of the pipeline eight times but today it passed language identical to a bill under consideration in the Senate by a vote of 252-161.

The Democratically-controlled upper chamber has long declined to vote on the matter but had a change of heart on Wednesday after Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana begged her colleagues to immediately bring the legislation to the floor.

Landrieu's Senate seat hangs in the balance after neither she nor her Republican opponent, Congressman Bill Cassidy, crossed a state-mandated threshold of 50 percent plus one in last week's election. The three-term senator hopes to fend off Cassidy in an upcoming run-off election by pushing through approval of Keystone.

Cassidy and Landrieu will go head to head on Dec. 6 as a result of Louisiana's jungle primary, which authorizes all candidates seeking office to appear on the ballot on Election Day. The top two vote-getters advance to a runoff if neither are able to reach a simple majority.

Landrieu currently trails Cassidy by 16 points, according to internal polling taken by the GOP candidate that was shared with MailOnline.

Passage of the pipeline may be her only shot of closing that gap.

Chair the Senate's Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Landrieu has made her seniority on the committee her main argument for reelection in her oil-rich state. 

However Cassidy got a bump of his own when incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell publicly promised him a seat on the committee this week, assuming he wins next month's election.

As soon as lawmakers returned to the Capitol for work this week Landrieu took to the Senate floor and called for a vote on Keystone in an attempt to even the score.

'We can have the Keystone pipeline and answer the frustrations of the American people so they can... say "Oh my gosh the senators of United States of America have ears, and they have brains, they have hearts and they heard what we said," ' she argued. 

The Keystone Pipeline System is an oil transportation system owned and operated by energy company TransCanada. It stretches from Alberta, Canada to southern Texas and Louisiana and would bring 700,000 barrels of oil daily from Canada to the Gulf Coast upon completion.

The first three phases of the pipeline have already been built, while a fourth phase, the XL portion, is still awaiting both government and court approval.

The XL pipeline would replace the already constructed first phase and would run from Hardisty, Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska.

Environmental groups strongly opposed the completion of the pipeline and have lobbied the U.S. government to shoot down the proposal.

In April the Obama administration announced that it was suspending its review of the pipeline until a court case in Nebraska challenging the XL route concluded.

White House officials, including the president, have repeatedly said in recent days that the administration's position on the issue has not changed. 

After Landrieu rallied fellow senators on Wednesday to bring Keystone XL under formal consideration, Cassidy took to the House floor to ask the lower chamber to do the same.

The legislation currently being debated was sponsored by Landrieu in her capacity as energy chief and was authored by Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota.

It now awaits a vote in the Senate, scheduled for next Tuesday, giving Landrieu a few more days to round up the 60 votes she needs to overcome a filibuster.

Every Republican in the Senate has committed to supporting the bill, giving her 45 yeas right off the bat. Now she needs to convince just 14 of her Democratic colleagues to vote her way, too. As of today, whip counts put her just one commitment shy of  60.

If the Senate joins the House in approving the legislation, it will go directly to the president's desk, per an agreement between Senate Republicans and Landrieu. President Barack Obama has not said whether he would veto it or not.

If he did, it would take 67 votes in the Senate to bypass him - a number that Landrieu will not likely be able to match.

Notwithstanding a veto from Obama, Landrieu is convinced that authorization of Keystone will be the miracle she needs to stay in Congress.

Cassidy has owned the issue as well in the final days of the campaign and tweeted this morning, 'Not so fast, my friend: Don’t fall for’s desperate “Hail Mary." '

The sponsor of the House version of the bill, Cassidy pointed out on Thursday during debate on the House floor that its been more than six years since TransCanada first applied for permission to build the pipeline. 

'The bill considered today that I introduced is the language asked for by the Senate. So we are going to make it as easy as possible for the Senate to finally get a bill to the president’s desk that approves this long-overdue Keystone XL pipeline,' Cassidy said.

'I encourage my colleagues to join me in approving the Keystone XL pipeline to finally provide 40,000 promised jobs to the American people.' 

After the House vote Hoeven, a Republican, sent out a statement congratulating fellow GOPer Cassidy on passing his legislation in the House - making it clear just where his allegiances lie in the Senate race, even if Landrieu's name is on the Senate bill with him.

Hoeven also stated that if the Senate was unable to reach 60 votes, he would reintroduce the bill next session after a handful of newly elected GOP lawmakers are seated.

And if Obama vetoes the legislation, 'we aren't finished,' Hoeven said on Thursday. 

'We'll pass it as either part of broader energy legislation or as an amendment to another must-pass bill.'

President Barack Obama would not say at a press conference last week if he would veto the construction of the XL portion of the pipeline. Obama said he was waiting to make a decision until after Nebraska's Supreme Court makes a ruling on the proposed path.

'On Keystone, there’s an independent process. It’s moving forward, and I’m going to let that process play out,' he said. 'The process is moving forward, and I’m just going to gather up the facts.'

That court ruling is anticipated to come in the next few weeks. 

Obama told reporters covering his press conference in Burma on Friday that his position on the issue remains the same. He did however push back on claims that Keystone would be a 'massive jobs bill' as proponents have claimed.

Furthermore, several senior level White House officials have said on the record this week that the administration has a 'dim view' of efforts in the legislative branch to force government approval of the pipeline, foreshadowing a possible veto from the president.

Obama has only issued two presidential vetoes in his nearly six years as president, but with Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress beginning in January, that number is expected to go up dramatically. 

House Speaker John Boehner chided Obama on Friday for his role in slowing down the Keystone construction process.

'Thousands more Americans would be working today if President Obama had put their priorities ahead of his political interests and approved the Keystone pipeline,' Boehner said in a statement after the House vote.

'Instead, he continues to block the project, and the new jobs, lower costs, and increased energy security it would provide,' Boehner continued. 'The president doesn’t have any more elections to win, and he has no other excuse for standing in the way. It’s time he start listening to the vast majority of Americans who support Keystone.'

A major environmental group, on the other hand, celebrated the prospect that the 'ill-considered legislation' could earn 'a well-deserved presidential veto.'

Danielle Droitsch, Canada Project Director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement on Friday afternoon that the 'House-passed bill is wrong for our country' and would 'short-circuit the deliberative approval process that President Obama has said should run its due course.' 

'It turns Congress into a permitting agency; even worse, one waiving all environmental safeguards and legal challenges from the public,' she claimed.

'President Obama has ample reason to veto this measure,' the statement went on to say, pointing out that the number of no votes in the House today show's just how many legislators 'know the pipeline would be a disaster for our climate and a danger to the land and water that sustains countless Americans.'
