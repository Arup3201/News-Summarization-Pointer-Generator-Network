The shocking decline of young English players in the Premier League is revealed by new research published by The Mail on Sunday which shows that the academies of the Premier League’s current 20 clubs have produced just 57 first-team regulars over the past 10 years.

In the week in which FA chairman Greg Dyke attempted to persuade Premier League clubs to increase the quota of home-grown players in their squad from eight to twelve, the new figures show that the nation’s elite clubs are producing fewer than three players per club on average over a decade with the league’s biggest clubs having some of the worst records.

Chelsea have produced no home-grown first-team regulars since John Terry emerged at the start of the millennium. Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City have had less than a handful each. Regular is defined as playing half or more of league games in a season.

The issue is becoming a major battleground between FA chairman Greg Dyke, who wants to introduce measures to increase opportunities for home-grown talent, and the Premier League clubs, who don’t want quotas forced upon them.

The new research on home-grown regulars produced in the past decade shows that only Southampton and Aston Villa, with seven such players each, and Newcastle, with five, had produced five or more since the start of the 2005-06 season.

The Southampton players who meet the criteria are Theo Walcott, Gareth Bale, Adam Lallana, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, James Ward-Prowse, Calum Chambers and Luke Shaw.

Theo Walcott is one of an abundance of players that have made a name for themselves after coming through the ranks at Southampton

West Ham United duo Mark Noble and Jack Collison came through the ranks at Upton Park, as did defender James Tomkins

Five of them have been capped by England, and Bale, the world’s most expensive footballer, by Wales, while James Ward-Prowse, 20 in November, has 28 England appearances below senior level.

But given that Premier League clubs have spent around £600 million combined on their academies in the last decade alone, or about £3m per club per year on average, the number of players most have produced for their first teams is pitiful.

The new research considers how many players the current 20 Premier League clubs have nurtured between the ages of 15-18 who have then gone on to be ‘regulars’ for that team.

Southampton’s academy has produced more players in the decade than the seven mentioned but not who have yet become regulars as defined.

On the same basis, Chelsea’s tally is zero, Manchester United’s is just two, in Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverley. Liverpool and Arsenal have produced just three each, respectively Justin Hoyte, Jack Wilshere and Kieran Gibbs, and Stephen Warnock, Raheem Sterling and Jon Flanagan.

Manchester City’s four such players were Stephen Ireland, Michael Johnson, Micah Richards and Nedum Onuoha. All the relevant ‘products’ of the 20 clubs over the decade are in the accompanying panel.

Dyke has started negotiations with the Premier League clubs to seek a minimum of 12 home-grown players per first-team squad of 25 by 2020, phased in from 2016 onwards. He wants the definition of ‘home-grown’ to be players registered with a club for three years before the age of 18.

Dyke’s aim is to expand the talent pool of English players with good amounts of high-level competitive exposure. Chelsea in many ways exemplify the core problem: they have more age-group England players below the senior team than anyone, and some truly outstanding youngsters. But those players for now are struggling to become first-team players let alone regulars at Stamford Bridge.

Managers like Jose Mourinho are charged with winning by their employers, not helping England. And many fans would probably agree that is something they support.

Dyke created the an FA England Commission in 2013 to explore the reasons for the low number of English players in the Premier League and suggest solutions to address the issue - with the stated aim of helping to improve the England team.

The number of English players in the Premier League has fallen as low as 32 per cent in recent years. Dyke wants that boosted to 45 per cent by 2022.

A Commission report last year highlighted how there is a particular ‘bottleneck’ for English players aged 18 to 21, limiting first-team opportunities at Premier League clubs. Many clubs prefer to use tried and tested - and often foreign - players instead of their own home-growns.

The alarming extent to which that is true is highlighted here. Minutes played by English players aged under 21 in the Premier League have fallen by more than half in 10 years, and Englishmen in the Champions League are a relatively rarity despite England have joint-most teams competing each season.

Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane has excelled in north London since bursting on to the scene and even earned an England call-up 

Former England manager Glenn Hoddle, a member of Dyke’s commission, believes that clubs should back his proposals, citing Harry Kane as an example.

‘You sense there is reluctance over Greg Dyke’s suggestion we increase the number of homegrown players,’ he said. ‘We will never know if our players are good enough unless they get the chance. Talent isn’t always as obvious as Raheem Sterling or Wayne Rooney.

‘Sometimes, as with Harry Kane, it takes time to develop and that only comes with games.

‘A year ago some at Tottenham would have questioned whether he was Champions League quality. They don’t now, but only because he was lucky to have managers willing to play him.’
