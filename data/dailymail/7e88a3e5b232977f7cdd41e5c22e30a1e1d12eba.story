Courtney Love's own father has made the sensational claim that his daughter was responsible for the death of Nirvana star Kurt Cobain - and he can prove it.

Hank Harrison, the ex-manager of the Grateful Dead, said that while he can't prove his daughter pulled the trigger on the shotgun that ended the grunge star's life 20 -years ago, he 'can prove her involvement to a high degree of certainty.'

Harrison, who is estranged from his rock-star daughter said that he became convinced she killed her own husband after the Seattle police released a note that Cobain held in his wallet mocking his wedding vows that called his wife a 'b***h with zits'.

Harrison told RadarOnline.com that he believes his 49-year-old daughter was complicit in her husband's death.

Updated: Hank Harrison has said that his book Love Kills: The Assassination of Kurt Cobain will be republished to include the proof of his daughters involvement

He is planning to publish his proof in his upcoming republished book, Love Kills: The Assassination of Kurt Cobain.

The final clue that sealed his opinion was the handwritten note inside the music legends wallet.

'Do you Kurt Cobain take Courtney Michelle Love to be your lawful shredded wife,' the note begins, 'even when she’s a b**ch with zits and siphoning all (your) money for doping and whoring.'

Harrison, who is also suspicious of the Seattle police's motives for only releasing new evidence 20-years on, said that the note is key.

'If you read the true meaning of this small note, and place it in conjunction with the rest of the evidence, anyone with even half a wit will see that something dire and awful took place,' Harrison alleges.

Indeed, his criticism of the Seattle police is strident.

'Nobody, except me, asked the obvious question: ‘Why weren’t they developed 20 years ago?’ he added to RadarOnline.

'They weren’t developed because the police had already decided it was a suicide and didn’t need any more evidence.'

Hank and Courtney's fractious relationship mirrored that of his with her mother Linda Carroll.

The pair were hanging out together and tripping on LSD when their daughter, Courtney Michelle Harrison was born in 1964.

They soon split and Love never became close with her father who specializes in medieval and Celtic history.

The brief contact they did have was when he would mail her packages of of LSD and Ecstacy when she was living in Liverpool, England as a teenager.

Harrison is banned from seeing Kurt and Courtney's daughter Frances Bean Cobain and has been concerned his daughter killed her own husband for years.

'She's a psychopath, she has a sociopathic personality like I do. I don't know who killed him. I know who benefited from his death: my daughter, for one,' said Harrison to NBC's Dateline in 2004.

Indeed, the note found on Cobain has only add fuel to the fires of speculation regarding the circumstances of the grunge legend's suicide and what role his troubled marriage and personal life played in the final days of his life.

Poetic play on words: This is the note that Kurt Cobain carried in his wallet that sarcastically mocked his marriage to wife Courtney Love

The release of the note by Seattle police last Friday is the latest revelation to come out of the departments decision to launch an internal review of the investigation into the rock star's death.

Anticipating huge media interest over the 20th anniversary of the star's suicide by shotgun, the Seattle police have decided to release dozens of never-before-seen picture from the crime scene.

They also released for the first time, the investigative detective's full report on the re-opening of the case - which came to the same conclusion of suicide, two decades on.

However, the sarcastic note will provide fans and conspiracy theorists hours of debate as they attempt to decipher the meaning behind the words.

Was the note written in anger by a resentful Cobain, desperate to escape his unhappy marriage?

Or was it a play on words penned with the knowledge of Love, that the musician carried around to remind him of their unconventional bond?

Those who believe that Love was involved in her husband's death will point to the fact that the content and tone of this note wildly differs from his handwritten suicide note.

New evidence: In March police in Seattle announced that new photographs of the scene of Kurt Cobain's suicide have been uncovered and developed

The short marriage parody calls his wife a 'b****' who is 'siphoning money for doping and whoring.'

This is in stark contrast to his believed suicide note which calls Love a 'goddess....who sweats ambition and empathy.'

Adding to the scuzzy appeal of the note, it is written on paper from the Phoenx Hotel in San Francisco's gritty, crime-infested Tenderloin district.

The Phoenix's reputation is that of an achingly cool refuge for poets and artists, very much like New York's infamous Chelsea Hotel.

And earlier this month on the eve of the 20th anniversary of Kurt Cobain's suicide, the Seattle Police Department released a cache of never-before- scene photos showing the room where the Nirvana frontman was found dead in April 1994.

In March, the law enforcement agency announced that it had developed 35 photos taken by officers who responded to Cobain's Seattle-area home two decades ago.

A set of photographs made public by police show the troubled singer's suicide note the way he left it before taking his life April 8, 1994.

CBS News reported that most of the photographs were shot on a 35mm film, which has become discolored over the years, giving the images a greenish hue. A few of the pictures were taken with a Polaroid, among them outside shots of Cobain's garage.
