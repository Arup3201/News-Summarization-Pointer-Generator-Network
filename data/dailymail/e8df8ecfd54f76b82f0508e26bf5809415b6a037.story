Charged: Laszlo Csatary was the world's most wanted Nazi for his alleged role in the Holocaust. He is accused of beating jews with his bare hands and a dog whip

A 98-year-old former police officer has been charged today by Hungarian prosecutors for abusing thousands of Jews and sending them to Nazi death camps during World War II.

Prosecutors say Laszlo Csatary was the chief of an internment camp for Jews at a brick factory in Kosice - a Slovak city then part of Hungary - in May 1944.

He is alleged to have overseen the deportation of 15,700 Jewish detainees to concentration camps.

The pensioner is also accused of beating them with his bare hands and a dog whip. He also allegedly refused to allow ventilation holes to be cut into the walls of a railcar crammed with 80 Jews being deported.

Csatary 'willfully assisted in the unlawful execution and torture of the Jews deported from (Kosice) to concentration camps in territories occupied by the Germans,' prosecutors said in a statement.

Csatary, who has denied the charges, was first detained by Hungarian authorities in July 2012 after his case was made public by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish organization active in hunting down Nazis who have yet to be brought to justice.

Budapest Investigative Prosecutors' Office spokesman Bettina Bagoly said that since Csatary has been charged with war crimes, the case is considered to be of special importance and the first session of the trial must be held within three months.

Bagoly also said that the prosecution has asked the court to tighten the conditions of Csatary's house arrest, which were loosened by a judge in April.

Csatary lived for decades in Canada and worked as an art dealer before leaving in 1997 just before he was due to appear at a deportation hearing. His Canadian citizenship was later revoked.

Though Csatary is currently expected to go on trial in Hungary, it is also possible that he could be extradited to Slovakia, where he was convicted in absentia in 1948.

In January, a court in Kosice changed the sentence in that case from death to life in prison, since the death penalty is banned in the European Union. That could open the way for his extradition.

Bagoly said prosecutors, who requested information in the case from Slovakia, Canada and Israel, had not yet received an extradition request from Slovakia.

Accused: The 98-year-old is alleged to have been the chief of an internment camp for 12,000 Jews

Case: Csatary was a senior police officer at the time he is accused of committing the crimes

Efraim Zuroff, head of the Wiesenthal 
Center's Jerusalem office, who brought Csatary to the attention of 
Hungarian officials, said he planned to attend the trial.

'We welcome the indictment and call 
upon authorities to expedite the trial in light of the defendant's 
advanced age,' Zuroff said by telephone from Israel. 'This is a very 
strong reminder of the importance of achieving justice even many years 
after the crimes were committed'

Csatary was placed under house arrest in Hungary after it was revealed he was secretly living in Budapest.

Acting on the information provided by
the Wiesenthal Center, prosecutors 
began an investigation.

Efraim 
Zuroff, the Wiesenthal Center's chief Nazi-hunter, said last year that 
he has been 'very upset and very frustrated' about the lack of action by
Hungarian authorities.

The
fact that Csatary lived freely in Hungary for some 15 years and the 
lack of progress by prosecutors also added to worries about the 
direction of the EU member state under right-wing Prime Minister Viktor 
Orban.
