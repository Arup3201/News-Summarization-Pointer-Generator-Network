The mystery man who inspired Boston by shoveling snow from the marathon finish line on Tuesday has been identified following a social media hunt.

Chris Laudani, a 25-year-old bartender, said he had been clearing snow from outside Back Bay Social Club, where he works, when he decided to head to the finish line to shovel there too.

'The finish line is my favorite spot in the whole city so I wanted to go down there and dig it out because I don't think it deserves to be covered in snow,' he told the Today show on Thursday. 

'Obviously it holds a special place in everybody in Boston's heart but for me it was more about the spirit of the Boston Marathon and the incredible amount of encouragement and positivity that surrounds the event and how much people, including myself, just love the race.'

Kind-hearted: Chris Laudani was identified as the man pictured shoveling the snow from the Boston marathon finishing line, where three people were killed in the bombing in April 2013

Three people, including a six-year-old boy, died at the finish line while watching the marathon on Boylston Street when the city was bombed on April 15, 2013.

On Tuesday afternoon, Philip Hillman was working in a nearby hotel room overlooking the street, when he snapped a photo of Laudani shoveling the snow and posted it to Twitter.

'I thought it was a powerful image when I looked at it,' Hillman told Today. 'I've been a resident of Massachusetts my whole life. For us, that finish line has become sacred ground.' 

Boston Police then released photographs on their social media of the mystery man and called for help identifying him using the hashtag #WhoShoveledTheFinishLine.

Back Bay Social Club, which is located about two blocks away from the finish line, identified the shoveler as Laudani.  

Dig it: Photos taken by Philip Hillman, who was working in a hotel nearby, were shared around social media, making it onto the Twitter of the Boston Police Department, who helped spread the word

ID please: The mystery man who shoveled off the marathon finish line on Boylston street during Juno was identified as local bartender Chris Laudani

Laudani, who was initially unaware of the search to find him because he does not have a Twitter account, said he was shocked by the attention and doesn't want to be hailed as a hero.

He told GMA he simply 'wanted to do a good deed for the community because I love Boston'. He added that he also loved the marathon, which he ran in 201 

After falling under more than two feet of snow that knocked out power in some areas, New England is bracing for a second round of heavy snowfall.

Forecasts predict that up to 12 inches of snow is on the way for Friday, and Sunday and Monday will bring down a wintry mix of snow and rain.  

Hardest hit in the storm were the towns of Marshfield and Scituate, just south of Massachusetts Bay, where storm surge breached an eight-foot flood wall at high tide - coating houses with icy seawater from below - as frost and snow blanketed them from above.

The flooding sank parked car and flooded roads - forcing the National Guard to evacuate some residents before high tide caused even more flooding again early this morning. 

Buried: Residents spent Wednesday digging out cars and sidewalks in Boston, after the storm dumped more than two feet in some areas

Frosted over: These coastal homes in Scituate, Massachusetts, on the South Bay, were coated in ice from sea spray and flooding caused by a massive storm sturge

Some 36 inches of snow fell in Lunenberg and Auburn, Massachusetts.

Elsewhere, blasts of wind topped 75mph. In Boston, Juno dumped 26 inches on many streets, with 30mph overnight winds. The total is two inches shy of the all-time record. 

The storm punched a gaping hole in a seawall and swamped a vacant home in Marshfield, Massachusetts, and flipped a 110-foot replica of a Revolutionary War ship in Newport, Rhode Island, snapping its mast and puncturing its hull.

Burrillville, Rhode Island, got 26.5 inches. More than 20 inches piled up in Portland, Maine, and 33.5 inches in Thompson, Connecticut. Orient, on the eastern end of Long Island, got about 30 inches.

Two deaths, both on Long Island, were tied to the storm by police: a 17-year-old who crashed into a light pole while snow-tubing down a street and an 83-year-old man with dementia who was found dead in his backyard. 

Lived to tell the tale: Tim Mannix was gashed in the face when a wave shattered a window of his house in Marshfield, and he had to be rescued by front-end loader and then Humvee

The Pilgrim nuclear plant in Plymouth, Massachusetts, was shut down after two transmission lines were damaged in the storm - though the plant remained safe, the Boston Globe reports. 

'I had to jump out the window because the door only opens one way,' Chuck Beliveau said in the hard-hit central Massachusetts town of Westborough. 

'I felt like a kid again. When I was a kid, we'd burrow through snow drifts like moles.'

New York City was spared the brunt of the storm - despite forecasters predicting so much doom and gloom at the governor shut down the subway system, the first time ever for snow, and the mayor closed all roads on Monday night and Tuesday morning. However, just a few inches of snow fell in the city. 

Bitter cold in New England threatens to complicate efforts to clear clogged streets and restore power to more than 15,000 customers shivering in the dark, including the entire island of Nantucket. A 78 mph wind gust was reported there, and a 72 mph one on neighboring Martha's Vineyard.

The low in Boston on Wednesday was expected to be 10 degrees, with a wind chill of minus 5. Forecasters warned that it won't get above freezing for a week.

Several inches more snow is slated to fall on New England on Friday and high winds return to much of the Northeastern US

The Quincy Patriot-Ledger reports that it could take days for power to be restored to everyone in the South Bay. The cold temperatures ensure that little snow will melt and digging out will be time consuming and arduous. 

't’s a lot of snowfall, and residents are encouraged to be patient. It’s going to take a couple days to clean this up properly,' Quincy spokesman Chris Walker told the newspaper.  

Despite the inconvenience of the storm, it brought little actual damage to New England. Save for a few homes that flooded in the seawall burst, most of the region was unscathed Wednesday.

About five homes have been condemned due to the flooding. 

There were no deaths in Massachusetts and less than 30,000 homeowners lost power during the storm.  

About 200 people stayed in storm shelters - far fewer than predicted, the Globe reports.

'If you’re the one dealing with power outages, you don’t really care that the number is a lot less than expected. But the fact that we are dealing with 25,000 power outages and not 250,000, I think, is a little bit of a blessing in all of this,' Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker told the newspaper. 

In Portland, Maine, Phil Curran uses a snow blower to dig out from the storm. Up to a foot more is expected for the area on Friday

All that remained of the blizzard-that-wasn't in New York on Wednesday was snow piles on sidewalks and at intersections

Deluged: Although Winter Storm Juno failed to live up to its hype in New York City, it was a very different story in many parts of New England. Wind-driven seas caused severe flooding along some roadways in coastal Massachusetts including in Scituate (pictured)
