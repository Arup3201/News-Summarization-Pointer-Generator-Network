Tragic: Scott Bradley (pictured) was driven to suicide after rumours circulated in the Scottish village where he lived that he was one of James Bulger's killers

A distraught mother whose son was driven to suicide by rumours he was one of James Bulger's killers claims an ignorant mob were to blame for his death.

Scott Bradley, 36, was accused of being 
child murderer Robert Thompson, whose real identity is protected, and 
suffered months of malicious abuse and torment from a hate mob in the 
village of Garlieston, Wigtownshire, in Scotland.

His mother Sue Bradley, 66, found her beloved son hanging from the top of their stairs three weeks ago.

Mrs Bradley said her son, a handyman, had turned 
into a nervous wreck after a campaign of hate in which he was branded a 
killer and a paedophile.

She said: '(One man) went round telling everyone 
that my son was definitely Thompson. People started shouting abuse at 
Scott in the street and calling him a child killer.'

'It was a build-up of months and months of pressure. The worst part for him was feeling helpless. He just couldn't take anymore.'

She said she was shocked at how callous people have been about his death and how little remorse his tormenters have shown.

She told the People: 'The night Scott died a friend was at a party and a woman talked about it and said, "Good result".'

In December 2010 Mr Bradley, who had moved from Bury, Greater Manchester, to share a home with him mother in the Scottish coastal village, broke into two sheds and stole some tools.

The following August he was jailed for four months for theft.

Shortly after, the community council put a poster warning about a man recently been released from jail.

It said he was due to go back to England but he was still in the area preying on young girls and frightening people.

Some locals assumed the man was Mr Bradley - which is when the evil hate campaign began.

Rumours circulated that Mr Bradley was under protection from the Home Office because he was Robert Thompson, who murdered James Bulger, two, along with Jon Venables, now both 30, in 1993.

The rumours started spreading to other villages and Mr Bradley, who had a teenage daughter and a young son, could not find work.

Then they intensified after after a local playwright wrote a 
fictional play last year about Robert Thompson moving to a remote 
coastal village in Galloway.

The play, Village of the Damned, proved so controversial that playwright
Des Dillon was interviewed by police.

In June this year it was revealed
Dillon was negotiating the rights to turn it into a Hollywood film.

Mr Bradley, who moved to Scotland seven 
years ago, left a heartbreaking suicide note which read: 'They called me
all sorts - a paedophile, a follower of young girls, walking around 
bullying old people.

'The list is endless. And I’m supposed to be a child killer.'

Mrs Bradley said Scott had turned into a nervous wreck after a campaign of hate in which he was branded a killer and a paedophile.

She said at the time of his death: 'My son was tormented by the allegations. He had a good heart and didn’t deserve this. It’s been heartbreaking.

'He kept saying ‘I’ve had enough, I’m going to kill myself’, but I didn’t believe him.'

James Bulger's mother Denise Fergus said
earlier this month that she was 'shocked and upset' to hear of Mr Bradley's death and claimed 
he would still be alive if the identities of Thompson and Jon Venables 
were not a secret.

Mrs Fergus said: 'What happened to Scott makes my blood run cold.

'I’m shocked and upset that he has apparently taken his own life.

'Whatever
the rights and wrongs of this case, this is one that shows how 
dangerous it is to spread false rumours and gossip about something as 
serious as the identity of child killers.'

She
said: 'Sadly Scott’s death goes to show it is other people who are left
to suffer as a result of the official conspiracy, lies and deceit that 
the authorities have used in this case.'

Robert Thompson and Jon Venables were just 10 years old when they abducted James Bulger from a shopping centre in Bootle in February 1993.

The pair walked the toddler several miles to a railway line in Walton, where they tortured and killed him, leaving his body on a train line where it was hit by a train.

Thompson and Venables were convicted of murder and served eight years in prison before being freed in 2001 and issued with secret new identities to protect them from vigilantes.

Venables was recalled to prison in 2010 after downloading child pornography. He is set to remain in prison indefinitely for his own safety after revealing his true identity.
