For male chimpanzees, there
may be a benefit to being a bully.

A study of chimpanzees in
Tanzania spanning 17 years found that males that subjected
females to long-term aggressive behavior, often including
physical attacks, greatly improved their chances of fathering
babies with them.

'It is certainly not a happy message,' said Arizona State
University evolutionary anthropologist Ian Gilby, one of the
researchers.

A dominant male chimpanzee feeds in Kibale National Park tropical rain forest, 354km southeast of Uganda's capital Kampala. Scientists said a 17-year study of chimpanzees in Tanzania's Gombe National Park found that males that subjected females to long-term bullying including physical attacks improved their chances of fathering babies with them.

'Males who directed aggression toward females at high rates
were more likely to sire those females' offspring than less
violent males were. 

'This effect was particularly strong for high
ranking males (in the chimpanzee community),' Gilby added.

The study involved an ape species that is a close genetic
cousin of humans but the researchers were wary about making
conclusions about the origins of sexual violence in people.

The researchers knew from detailed long-term observations of
this chimp community in Tanzania's Gombe National Park which
ones had mated with one another as well as the paternity of 31
babies born during the study period from 1995 through 2011 based
on DNA collected from fecal matter.

'The hypothesis is that females are intimidated by long-term
aggression from the male so that they acquiesce or even solicit
mating from the male when they are fertile, and avoid mating
with other males in his presence for fear of further aggression
from the male,' said Duke University evolutionary anthropologist
Anne Pusey, one of the researchers.

Male chimps  that subjected females to long-term aggressive behavior, often including physical attacks, greatly improved their chances of fathering babies with them.

The aggressive behavior by the males included violent
physical attacks including biting and striking that sometimes
caused wounds as well as chasing the female and engaging in
outbursts in which the male charges and strikes nearby foliage.

Mating did not take place during or immediately after the
bullying. 

In fact, it was serial aggressive behavior over two or
three years that was particularly effective in later securing
fatherhood.

The researchers found that females at their time of peak
fertility actively sought to mate with the males that bullied
them.

The researchers noted that the evolutionary lineage for
humans and chimps split some 7 million years ago and that the
mating systems for the two species are different.

'Nevertheless, recognizing the adaptive value of male-female
aggression in chimpanzees may inevitably help us to understand,
and hopefully prevent, similar behavior among humans,' Gilby
said.

The research was published in the scientific journal Current
Biology.
