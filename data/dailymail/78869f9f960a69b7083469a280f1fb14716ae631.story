A ten-year-old boy burst into tears as he led his school in the Pledge of Allegiance - only to be surprised by the return of his soldier father who had been serving in Afghanistan.

Ten-year-old Christopher had taken to wearing a camouflage T-shirt to school in honor of his father Staff Sergeant Luis Bratic who had been away from home for 11 months.

Last Thursday, in the gymnasium of Mason Elementary School in Grand Blanc, Michigan, Christopher led his fourth grade assembly in the words with their hands placed over their hearts.

As they chanted the words, Sgt Bratic appeared from behind an American flag and recited the words before embracing his son, the pair clinging to each other in floods of tears.

The emotional moment was captured on camera in full by Michigan Live.

The father and son had limited contact while Sgt Bratic was serving in Kabul with infrequent chats on Skype and Facebook. 

The ten-year-old had talked incessantly about the day his father was due to come home, supposedly in two weeks.

The reunion left the father and son and many other gathered students, teachers and parents in tears.

Sgt Bratic, who is originally from Brooklyn, New York and has spent 19 years in the military completing three foreign tours, told Michigan Live the reunion was the 'best thing in the world'. 

Christopher added he couldn't wait to see The Avengers with his dad.
