Two care workers who 'abused, degraded and mocked' mentally-ill patients 'for their own amusement' while another took photos on her mobile phone have been jailed.

William Bowman, 22, and Chevonne Benson, 23, subjected their victims - many who suffer from dementia - to systematic abuse including hair pulling, name calling and cruel pranks, while Claire Strong, 21, took pictures of the humiliating incidents.

The offences at Bupa-run Beacon Edge Nursing Home in Penrith, Cumbria, took place between January and September last year.

The mistreatment only emerged when a female carer started work at the home and resigned, appalled at some of the events she witnessed, after just one shift.

The whistle-blower's concerns were passed to management before social services and the police became involved, Carlisle Crown Court heard.

Bowman, from Bowscar, near Penrith, was jailed for three-and-a-half years today after he admitted eight counts of ill-treatment of a person without a capacity and was convicted earlier this week of sexually assaulting a resident at the care home.

Benson, from Penrith, was sentenced to three years after she pleaded guilty to 10 counts of ill-treatment of a person without capacity.

Strong, of Clifton, was jailed for one year after she admitted three counts of ill-treatment of a person without capacity.

Detective Constable Carolyn Willacy, who led the investigation, said: 'The level of ill-treatment towards residents by these three was so shocking that a member of staff resigned after working only one shift.

'She was left distraught by what she saw but displayed great courage and decency by speaking out.

'All of the residents involved in this case suffered some form of mental illness, most from dementia. Their lack of understanding and inability to report the abuse made them an easy target.

'Bowman and Benson abused, degraded, and mocked those people who were under their care. Their vile acts would be recorded by Strong on her mobile phone. They subjected their victims to torment, including hair pulling and verbal abuse which left them visibly distressed.' 

The horrific abuse took place at the Bupa-run Beacon Edge Nursing Home in Penrith, Cumbria

In a joint statement issued through police, the families of the victims said: 'Due to their illnesses, we do not know how the victims, our loved ones, feel about what happened to them, but we do our best to speak on their behalf.

'The investigation and court case have been extremely distressing for us all and we do not take any pleasure in the outcome.

'There are lessons to be learnt from this case and we hope all involved will work together towards preventing anything like this happening again.'

They thanked the woman who spoke out and exposed the abuse.

Senior prosecutor Isla Chilton said: 'The three defendants physically, verbally and emotionally abused vulnerable men and women for their own amusement. William Bowman also further degraded one of the residents by sexually assaulting her.

'The victims were lovingly placed in the care of the residential home by their families. It is a place where they should have been looked after and all their needs met.

'However these three employees abused the trust placed in them by their employers and the victim's families by their demeaning treatment of them.

'It is due to the willingness of the witnesses in coming forward which brought an end to the abuse and has enabled us to bring these defendants to justice for their abhorrent actions.'
