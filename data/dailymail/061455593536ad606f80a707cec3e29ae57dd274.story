Manchester City face the potentially daunting task of needing to topple the mighty Barcelona in a bid to reach their first ever Champions League quarter-final. 

The Premier League champions will host Barca at the Etihad Stadium on February 24 before a trip to the Nou Camp three weeks later.

Will Manchester City be happy with their draw?

Well, director of football Txiki Begiristain said immediately after the draw that City were 'very confident'. And who can blame them given the last couple of weeks? 

'We have plenty of confidence with the way we qualified beating Bayern Munich at home and Roma away,' he said. 'The players will be working hard to get fit and arrive in confidence for those games. 

Have the two teams met before?

Just a bit - this is exactly the same tie as last season's second round. City were beaten 4-1 on aggregate, largely thanks to Martin Demichelis horror performance at the Etihad Stadium. Manuel Pellegrini's side were barely in it from the off.  

Who do Manchester City have to watch out?

A certain Lionel Messi is said to be a dab hand in these Champions League knockout games and is certain to cause even the very best all sorts of problems.

Whether Luis Suarez is able to arrest his slump since joining the Catalans over the summer remains to be seen, and encouragingly for City, the Uruguayan only scored once in four games against them while at Liverpool. 

An awful lot rests on the shoulders of Sergio Aguero, so the importance of Gerard Pique cannot be underestimated; he is the sort of defender who is capable of shackling the Argentine in full flight. 

And what about the managers?

Luis Enrique is very much a novice at this level and that could be the sort of weakness City try and play on. Manuel Pellegrini is one of the best tactical coaches in Europe and definitely has the upper hand over the young boss.

What kind of draw is it for the fans?

Supporters flying from Manchester to Barcelona can get tickets for around £250, so it's not the cheapest option available from the draw. That coupled with the fact many will have been at last season's second leg doesn't make it as appealing as you'd perhaps imagine. 

From the airport, hop on a train to Sants station and then take the green metro line to Les Corts.   

What has it done for Manchester City's chances of winning the Champions League? 

No bookie seems to know what's going to happen here - the odds of both sides winning the competition have actually lengthened. 

There weren't too many draws more favourable than this for City, particularly given Barcelona's indifference under Enrique, although it was they who drifted the furthest afterwards.
