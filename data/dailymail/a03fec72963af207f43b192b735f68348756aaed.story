Marc Wilmots hit out at Argentina after his side lost 1-0 in the World Cup quarter-finals, labelling his opponents ‘ordinary’ and claiming that the referee had protected Leo Messi.

Argentina won with an eight-minute strike from Gonzalo Higuain but Wilmots was dismissive of the Argentine performance, claiming they used time-wasting tactics and said that referee Nicola Rizzoli afforded Messi special treatment.

Wilmots said: ‘We were not impressed by the Argentina, absolutely not. It’s just an ordinary team. If I had played this way I would have been destroyed by Belgian press.

Angry: Belgium coach Marc Wilmots labelled Argentina 'ordinary' in their 1-0 World Cup quarter-final loss

Bias? Wilmots also criticised Italian referee Nicola Rizzoli (right) for favouring Lionel Messi (centre)

‘We’ve seen the experience of 
Argentina.

'They can distort the rhythm, they take 30 seconds to do a 
throw in and the referee does nothing.

'They can break down the speed of 
the game. I was wondering who was favourite, who was making the game?

'It
 was a small, small mistake that cosy and we were incredibly sorry we 
lost but we were very proud of the boys.

Wilmots
 also said that Messi was being unpunished for fouls he made but was 
protected when he was fouled. ‘I think that Messi is the star, the 
player giving the rhythm.

'He never loses the ball. But he made a couple 
of tackles and fouls but the referee never gave them against him.

Finish: Gonzalo Higuain put Argentina ahead on eight minutes with a superb turning shot

'I 
don’t want to be cry baby, but I’m noticing whenever there is a little 
foul, it’s always in favour of Argentina.

'Messi made three fouls and no 
yellow cards. This is difference.

'But don’t expect me to complain about 
the refereeing.’

Victory: Argentina have reached their first World Cup semi-final since 1990 - and on rivals Brazil's home soil

Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella praised his side, however, after they secured a final four place.

The South Americans have not lost a World Cup match after going ahead since 1958.

Sabella said: 'After 24 years (since their last semi-final) this is a good tribute to this squad - they will go down in history as one of the best four teams in the world and we will see if they can go one step more.

'I felt he played a wonderful match. it’s not only scoring goals, it’s having possession, taking out three opponents and every move he makes is a sign of hope for us and endangers our opponents.

'That a player like Messi almost never loses the ball is water in the desert - he gives us that water in the desert.

'Today when the terrain was dry he gave us that breath of fresh air every time he had the ball.

Sabella confirmed that Real Madrid winger Angel Di Maria would have tests on a thigh injury after he limped out of the match.
