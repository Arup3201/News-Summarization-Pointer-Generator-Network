The saying goes that you can't teach an old dog new tricks.

But this dog showed that he was trying to learn a few new tricks when he got his head stuck in a cat house in Long Island and had to be rescued by amused police officers.

Buddy, the golden retriever was clearly curious when he pushed his head in the cat house on Friday morning to take a look inside.

Stuck: Two officers from Suffolk County Police Department dismantle a cat's house in an attempt to free Buddy the dog after his head got stuck 

But he didn't bank on getting stuck.

Officers Stephen Lukas and Martin Gill, along with Sergeant Kit Gabrielsen, came to the rescue at 11:10 a.m. after a woman reported that her dog was stuck in a cat house.

The officers from Suffolk County Police Department in Medford, New York, used crow bars and a hammer to dismantle the green and white  house while the dog's head hung out of it.

Buddy was freed, unharmed and released to his owner.

Police said the nosy golden retriever is absolutely fine after his ordeal.

The cat had no comment.
