Manchester United will not be renaming Old Trafford.

Earlier this week it emerged La Liga giants Real Madrid were set to sell naming rights to their iconic Santiago Bernabeu home to energy firm Cepsa.

Reports in Spain, which the club declined to comment on, suggested the stadium would become the Abu Dhabi Bernabeu, named after the homeland of the company’s owners as part of a wider 500m euros deal.

The club believe there would be little appetite to rename the stadium as people will always call it Old Trafford

And with United’s cross-town rivals raking in a reported £400m over 10 years after they sold the Eastlands naming rights along with a host of other sponsorship rights to Etihad Airways, some believed it was only a matter of time until the club’s 115-year-old home was next on the list.

Sportsmail, however, understands United officials have no plans to follow suit.

They believe there would be little commercial appetite for such a proposal given that few would refer to the stadium as anything other than Old Trafford.

Added to an undoubtedly furious backlash from supporters, the feeling is that such a move would make little sense.

A source said: ‘It’s been made clear before - Old Trafford is Old Trafford and there are no plans to change that. What does or does not happen in Madrid makes absolutely no difference to us.’

Down the road from United’s home, Lancashire County Cricket Club play at Emirates Old Trafford while a host of clubs across the world are cashing in from lucrative deals.

At City, the agreement with Etihad was key as they attempted to meet Uefa’s Financial Fair Play criteria.

However, they only moved to the stadium in 2003 and there was little affinity among supporters with its existing name.
