Vicious taunts: Thandie Newton, 41, was taught to keep a low profile when she was growing up - to try and protect her from horrific racist abuse

She has dazzled audiences with her on-screen appearances and is used to being the centre of attention on the red carpet.

But actress Thandie Newton was taught to keep a low profile when she was growing up – to try and protect her from horrific racist abuse.

The 41-year-old star of Crash, who was raised in Penzance, has vivid memories of her family being bullied because of their race.

She said her father Nick, who is white British, tried to protect them – but her mother Nyasha, a Zimbabwean, wanted her daughter to avoid attracting attention to minimise the amount of verbal abuse her family were subjected to.

The British actress recalled: ‘It was a beautiful environment, but very backward when it came to racial politics.

‘I was getting good grades, I was a really happy, sparkly child and she [Thandie’s mother] was aware that the more I was achieving, the more resentment there was from other people. But I didn’t understand, I was only little.’ 

She added: ‘Just walking through the town was drawing attention to ourselves – so of course that  has an effect on how you want your kids to be.’

Miss Newton, who was born in London and spent the first three years of her life in Zambia, said she and her younger brother Jamie were the only black children in the area and were treated as outsiders.

When she started at a school which was run by Catholic nuns, a teacher said: ‘We’re very excited, we’ve never had one before.’

And her mother was told that cornrowed hair was ‘unsuitable’ for the school’s image.

Miss Newton also recalled an  elderly lady who used to scream racist abuse at her family from across the street.

The actress  told The Times: ‘She was shouting horrible things like, “Get back to the jungle where you belong,” and “You wog”.’

She added: ‘Moving from Zambia to Cornwall in the 1970s was an extraordinary experience. 

‘The story of living in Penzance as the only black family would make a fabulous sitcom if there had been a little more humour.’
