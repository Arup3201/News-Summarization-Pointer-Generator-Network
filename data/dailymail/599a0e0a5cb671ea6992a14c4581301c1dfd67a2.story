Many drivers often become the victims of road myths - from putting make-up on at the traffic lights to wearing a seat belt below your shoulder; these are among some of the most common myths that are often mistaken for on the road.

With Christmas fast approaching and families planning road trips, Allianz Global Assistance is urging Australians to take caution on the road ahead of the festive season.

Allianz Global Assistance spokesman Simon Wilson told Daily Mail Australia that Christmas is the most busiest time of the year and it's important to know all the basic principal of driving.

With Christmas fast approaching, drivers are encouraged to take caution while travelling on the road

‘From time to time, we hear these excuses coming from our customers and we don’t know where they’ve originated from,' Mr Wilson told Daily Mail Australia.

'First of all, plan your journey, especially if it's a long one. Plan all your stops so you're not suffering from fatigue.

'Second thing I recommend is to have patience on the road. I know it's a busy time of the year and we're all trying to see our loved ones and friends but road safety is essential.

‘The third is to  know the safely around yourself and others but the number one priority - regarding how urgent you have to get wherever - it’s more preferable to be late than being in an accident.’

Based on the company's 30 years experience with customers and road side assistance, Allianz Global Assistance have revealed the top five myths to ensure drivers don't commit the same mistakes again.

One of the common road myths: 'winding down the window and turning on loud music helps with driving fatigue'

The car insurance company found one of the biggest myths is 'men are better drivers than women'

Winding down the window and turning on loud music helps with driving fatigue

‘I think the message is there’s no substitute for stopping and resting. Loud music hinders and may actually add to the distraction when you’re driving,’ Mr Wilson told Daily Mail Australia.

'Everyone is always in a hurry but what we encourage is to plan ahead and allow more travel time and have a tactic in mind.'

You can only be fined for speeding if you’re going more than five kilometres over the speed limit

‘We’re not sure where it originated from but with today’s technology, I won’t take that chance myself. Even if you’re only going over by one kilometre – you’re still breaking the law and you will get a fine for speeding.’

The company suggests setting your alarm back a bit earlier so you're not multi-tasking while driving

Plan your journey: 'Especially if it's a long one. Plan all your stops so you're not suffering from fatigue'

It’s okay to wear a seat belt below your shoulder if it feels comfortable, as long as you buckle up

‘This is an interesting one - the leading causes of deaths on the roads are under the age of 35.

'Studies show that seat belts prevent these accidents from becoming critical. Even though it’s uncomfortable – it reduces minimal accidents and injuries. Wear them the way they’re design to wear because it’ll prevent some serious injuries.

You won’t be distracted whilst putting make-up on in the car, while stopping at a red traffic light

‘I know people are always rushing out the door but trying to multi-task while driving is not ideal. Set your alarm clock 15 minutes earlier so you have enough time to get ready and not be distracted when you’re getting ready inside your vehicle.'

Men are better drivers than women

'One of the biggest myths the company has heard are male drivers are better than women. It’s an interesting myth because we actually have more men making claims than women but it’s definitely one that leads a mystery,’ Mr Wilson said.
