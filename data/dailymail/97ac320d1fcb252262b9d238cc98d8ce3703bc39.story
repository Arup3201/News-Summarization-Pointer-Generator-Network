Recruitment manager Jennifer Newman, 34, has won a £30,000 payout after her boss groped her, called her 'proper top totty' in front of clients, and then sacked her

A widowed mother of two has won a £30,000 payout after her boss groped her and made lewd comments about her in front of clients.

Jennifer Newman, 34, was called ‘proper top totty’ by Steve Hoad and described as dressing like ‘someone who works in a dubious establishment’.

Hoad’s wife, who also worked at the firm, accused her of having an affair with her husband before she was sacked as recruitment manager.

Mrs Newman said she joined the company, Hydro Cleansing, in April last year and problems began in June when Hoad emailed her a picture of a semi-naked woman in bondage gear, asking: ‘Have you got a suit like this?’ Then, to the laughter of colleagues, he added: ‘She does look like you.’

On another occasion he threw a pen to the floor in front of clients and asked her to pick it up, but when she walked off he said: ‘Look at that, proper top totty’ to laughter from the clients.

She said his inappropriate comments increased when she had breast enhancement surgery.

The final straw came on July 10 last year when Hoad groped her bottom after she asked for an advance on her salary to take her two daughters on holiday.

Mrs Newman, whose husband died in a car crash in 2009, told the employment tribunal in Croydon, South London: ‘I felt absolutely violated, upset and demeaned. 

'It was as though Steve felt that by asking for an advance on my salary it gave him the right to touch me.’

The £32,000-a-year executive, who lives in Croydon, reported the incident to HR as a protected disclosure, which employers are bound under British law to treat confidentially. 

However, the details were leaked to staff including Hoad’s wife, Carol.  

The tribunal was given an account of a car journey taken by Mrs Newman and Mr Hoad to the Caravanning and Camping Club in Coventry.

Mrs Newman said her boss was being unusually quiet compared to his usual 'chatty' self when he would 'comment on his relationship with his wife and how she had been caught having a number of affairs over the years.'

'In his words "caught with her knickers down"', Mrs Newman added in her statement.

Mrs Newman said that despite being previously 'polite and cordial' Mrs Hoad turned hostile towards her on her return to the office and was also seen holding her HR file before having a heated row with her husband.

A Croydon tribunal heard that recruitment manager Mrs Newman, 34, was then accused of having an affair with him by his wife. She was also described as dressing like 'someone who works in a dubious establishment' after she underwent breast enlargement

Mrs Hoad 'had put two and two together' after hearing the allegations and believed the pair were having an affair, the tribunal heard.

On returning from her holiday on August 19, Mrs Newman was told 'within an hour' she had been made redundant in a meeting without the Hoads present.

Kayleigh Long, representing Mrs Newman, said: 'She had complained about Mr Hoad who usually got away with behaving as he wished.

'They wanted her out and she was pushed out of the company because of her rejection of behaviour by Mr Hoad. It began with comments and it ended with her dismissal.'

She added: 'A letter sent during the course of litigation reflects the insulting comments sent during her employment.

'It refers to her wearing tight jeans and a crop top without a bra after having undergone breast enhancement surgery. 

'There is a further comment in that letter that says her attire was akin to someone who works in a dubious establishment.

'Miss Newman found this very upsetting and degrading, she says it is a complete fabrication and felt it was the harassment carrying on after she left the company.'

The Croydon employment tribunal heard that 
the harassment began when Ms Newman received an email from Mr Hoard of a 
picture of a semi-naked woman in bondage gear - and said 'she looks like you' 

Mr Hoad and his firm failed to send representatives to the tribunal where the panel unanimously upheld Ms Newman’s complaints.

She was awarded £29,525.06 in damages, while Hydro Cleansing and Mr Hoad were ordered to also pay her legal costs, totalling £12,897.

Speaking afterwards, Ms Newman said: 'This means a lot to me and my family - it’s compensation for what this man put me through.

'Hopefully it will be recognised that I’ve made a stand for lots of women out there who are afraid to speak out.

'I took my problem to HR and they broke my confidence, people need to be protected.'

She added: 'I’m a youngish single mum. I’ve been through a lot, but I’ve picked myself up and dusted myself down.

'I’ve never experienced working for any company like this. But I’m career-minded and I couldn’t bury my head in the sand.

'It’s a relief, justice has prevailed. The next step is moving on.'
