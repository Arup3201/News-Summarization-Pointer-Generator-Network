Message: Senior Roma official Damian Draghici has said that Britain should be more worried about bankers 'stealing' than beggars from his country

Britain should be far more worried about bankers 'stealing' billions than Roma who will come to beg on the streets from the New Year, a senior Romanian official has said.

Damian Draghici, an adviser to the country's prime minister, believes migrants from his nation should be given the chance to settle in the UK.

The 43-year-old, who is also a Roma, said he expected 
relatively few would make the journey to the UK when the 
restrictions on the movement of Romanians and Bulgarians in the EU are 
lifted on January 1.

Mr Draghici said they did not like Britain because it was too cold and 
predicted that only around 2,000 to 3,000 would travel to the UK this 
winter.

'The Roma begging in the streets are obvious because we see them, they ask for one pound or one euro and they bother us. Yet some of the people in the banks are stealing billions of euros but nobody sees them because they are on the 60th floor,' he told The Times.

'Seventy per cent of Roma that left from Romania in the last 10 years are integrated. They have kids that go to school and they act like active citizens and taxpayers in the places where they are.'

He added that groups who set up camp on Park Lane on several occasions this year were the 'exception'.

Romania has around two million Roma and there are 750,000 in Bulgaria, although many have already left for Western Europe seeking work since the countries joined the EU in 2007.

Estimate: Mr Draghici says that Britain's cold weather will put off migrants, and he expects around 3,000 to enter after Britain after January 1

Migrants from these countries coming to 
Britain in the New Year could put huge pressure on housing, schools and 
hospitals, a major report warned last week.

The study by the centre-left Institute for Public Policy Research says most of the new arrivals will settle in London and the South East – meaning public services in these areas will be most affected.

It warns that Britain could see an increase in anti-social behaviour, aggressive begging, rough sleeping and criminality from next week.

And it says David Cameron’s much heralded changes to benefits rules are ‘largely symbolic’ and will make little or no difference.

Mr Cameron has resisted calls to face down the EU and extend the controls, despite opinion polls showing huge public support for such a move.
