Looking back nearly two weeks on I am still stunned by the scale of Carl Froch's fight against George Groves. The pressure on everyone involved was so big, but no one carried more than Carl.

The winner was always going to go on and become the biggest household name in British boxing and I always felt that despite everything Carl has achieved, he would be judged on that night. That’s brutal but that’s life.

I went in to see him before the fight and I told him: ‘You simply have to win because everything you have achieved will mean nothing if you don’t.’ He said: ‘I know, it's unbelievable, eh?’ It’s not fair, but what can you do? The finish was stunning, the night was stunning.

Now we are looking at the next step for Carl. There is no cast iron guarantee that Carl will fight again unless the opportunity is right. If the right fight doesn't present itself there is a real possibility Carl will retire.

There are three realistic options for opponents – a third fight with Mikkel Kessler, James DeGale and Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr. I don’t think Carl is in any rush to fight again and I don’t think in his mind he is 100 per cent about coming back. It is all about the opportunity.

A fight in Las Vegas is what he really wants to do and Chavez would be the most realistic fight to happen in Vegas. It is not necessarily 'Vegas or nothing', but all the noises from Carl are that he has done almost everything and what could possibly follow Wembley? ‘What can get me motivated like I was for that fight?’ is how he looks at it.

I had a meeting with James DeGale last week, I am meeting Sauerland Promotions on Wednesday and on Tuesday I spoke to Bob Arum about Chavez and Vegas.

Like I said and Carl has said many times, he wants to fight in Vegas. I think he wants Chavez more, but there is always a case for big domestic fights and he likes going to war with Kessler. They like punching each other. If DeGale or Kessler could be made in Vegas then Carl would consider those as well, but being realistic Chavez is the Vegas fight and I know it would sell.

We now need to look into the demand, appetite and money for all our options.

DeGale is an interesting case because he is the IBF mandatory challenger, but Carl doesn’t have to fight him until February. It’s feasible that Carl will fight someone else this time and then come back to DeGale in Spring. It is also possible that Carl will take a break and come back next Spring, but if he comes back this year it is likely to be at the end of November.

He wants Vegas and that is what I am working on.

From one world title fight to another. We have agreed terms with Golden Boy for Kell Brook to fight Shawn Porter on August 9 at the Barclays Centre in New York. I have been quite vocal on Twitter in not announcing fights until contracts are signed. The process is simple – you agree terms and then you proceed to contracts. That is where we are at in this moment. We expect to execute those contracts within the next 24 hours.

I don’t see any issues coming up. We tried everything we could to get Porter to the UK but there was zero interest from their team. We are very happy with the deal, though, and Kell is in fantastic shape.

He has been training since March, when he had his last fight, and his weight is perfect. He is absolutely firing on all cylinders. I cannot see anything else other than a stoppage win for Kell Brook.

No trip: Porter (here knocking down Paulie Malignaggi) didn't have any interest in a fight over in Great Britain

It is a big shout – Porter is a great talent. But let’s break it down. Porter’s win over Devon Alexander to win the IBF title was impressive, but Alexander was inactive. Then there was the performance against Paulie Malignaggi, which was impressive but how much does Malignaggi have left? Porter also drew with Julio Diaz, and went the distance with Phil Lo Greco. Shawn Porter is certainly not superman.

I am confident that if he mauls forward and tries to fight like he did against Malignaggi, then he will walk on to one against Brook. Brook is not Malignaggi. When he hits you, you know about it. A deal will be done on Wednesday or Thursday and then Kell will have the fight he wants so badly.

I was so happy to see Jamie McDonnell become a two-time world champion on Carl Froch’s undercard. He has had a horrible 12 months, having his IBF world title stripped because of politics, but he has the WBA world bantamweight title and we are now planning his next move.

Who next? We saw Paul Butler beat Stuart Hall to take McDonnell’s old IBF belt and now we have the prospect of two British fighters in a unification fight. Frank Warren, Butler’s promoter, says he has made an offer, but neither Jamie nor I have received an offer.

Just champion: Jamie McDonnell became a two-time world title holder at Wembley

Next up? McDonnell could face Paul Butler (right) in a unification fight

That said, it is a fight we would love to make. We have sent a written offer to Butler's team for a huge purse of £200,000. If Frank wants to beat that offer, then we will certainly consider it. We don’t want to play games, let’s make this fight.

Brian Rose is fighting for a world title this weekend against Demetrius Andrade in New York.  

This is a huge opportunity for Brian. He has been out there for a couple of weeks and is living the dream. There are question marks over whether he can do it at this level, but he is a mandatory challenger and has earned the right to this shot. He is very confident and we all believe he can do it, but this is a tough, tough job.

I am going to New York on Wednesday where I have a series of meetings lined up with Golden Boy, HBO, Top Rank etc to discuss all sorts of things. I am discussing Porter against Brook, Froch and Chavez, the possibility of Kevin Mitchell against Miguuel Vazquez for the IBF lightweight title, and the possibility of Lee Selby against Evgeny Gradovich for the IBF featherweight title. Plenty is going on.

A Rose win would make this an incredible trip.
