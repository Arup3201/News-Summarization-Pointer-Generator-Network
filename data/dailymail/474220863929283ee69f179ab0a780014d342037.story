They gathered in the same studio to record the same song... but what a difference 30 years makes.

Back in 1984, the group that sang the original Do They Know It's Christmas? included such global superstars as David Bowie, Paul McCartney and George Michael.

Today? The new Band Aid features three social media celebrities with millions of fans on the internet – but no experience of professional singing.

In a sign of the times, Zoe Sugg, Joe Sugg and Alfie Deyes – all made famous by YouTube – are part of the group of performers Sir Bob Geldof has gathered around him for the project, which is raising money to help alleviate the Ebola crisis.

The trio have become known for creating and publishing short clips on the video sharing website. Miss Sugg, 24, posts beauty and fashion videos under the name Zoella and has more than 6.5million subscribers.

The 'YouTubers', as they are known, are joined on the track by veteran musicians including Sir Bob and Bono, as well as rising stars of the new generation such as Ed Sheeran.

And in another modern twist, some of the biggest acts in the line-up are those made famous by reality television – such as boy band One Direction, who were formed on X Factor in 2010. 

They have gone on to become a worldwide phenomenon and have topped the UK charts three times. Fellow X Factor star Olly Murs has had four number one hits.

Elsewhere, however, the new Band Aid line-up includes 11 musicians who have never had a UK number one single – a stark contrast to the original group that included members of Bananarama, Duran Duran and Status Quo.

The new cohort does have 28 number ones between them, but half of these come from veteran stars Bono, 54, Midge Ure, 61, Queen drummer Roger Taylor, 65, and Sir Bob, 63.

Members of the bands Bastille, Elbow and Underworld, as well as artists including Emeli Sande, 27, Paloma Faith, 33, and Jessie Ware, 30, are all taking part despite having never had a single top the UK charts.

However, their luck might be about to change – as the power of the internet has allowed Do They Know It's Christmas? to climb the charts three weeks before it is even released. So many fans have pre-ordered a copy on Amazon that it has shot to second on the shopping website's list of most purchased singles.

The line-up of performers on the track also includes two British rising stars who do not feature in the studio picture – 22-year-old Sam Smith and Rita Ora, 23.

The official BBC Children In Need single has topped the UK chart. The song – a cover of Avicii's Wake Me Up – was sung by Gareth Malone's All Star Choir, featuring celebrities including Great British Bake Off host Mel Giedroyc, actress Linda Robson and ex-footballer Fabrice Muamba.

But Adele refuses to take part

With Ed Sheeran and One Direction signing up to Band Aid, it can boast some of the biggest young stars in modern British music.

But there is one conspicuous absence from the line-up – Adele, 26, who has reportedly not been taking Sir Bob Geldof's calls.

The Skyfall singer, whose album 21 is one of the top-selling records of all-time in Britain, was said to have been asked 'hundreds' of times, but will not appear on the track. According to Sir Bob, this is because she is focusing on her family.

He said: 'Adele is doing nothing. She's not answering the phone. She's not writing. She's not recording. She doesn't want to be bothered by anyone.

'She won't even pick up the phone to her manager. She's bringing up a family, you know.'

The original 1984 line-up included global superstars such as David Bowie, Paul McCartney, George Michael and Status Quo

It's not only the line-up that has changed since Band Aid first released Do They Know It's Christmas? in 1984. The lyrics have also been altered to reflect the ebola crisis.

The original line 'Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears' has been replaced with 'Where a kiss of love can kill you and there's death in every tear'.

The words 'Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you' have become 'Well tonight we're reaching out and touching you', while the chorus is a call to 'feel the world' and 'heal the world' as well as 'feed the world'.

And instead of 'There won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time. The greatest gift they'll get this year is life. Where nothing ever grows. No rain or rivers flow. Do they know it's Christmas time at all?', they sing 'No peace and joy this Christmas in West Africa. The only hope they'll have is being alive. Where to comfort is to fear. Where to touch is to be scared. How can they know it's Christmas time at all?'
