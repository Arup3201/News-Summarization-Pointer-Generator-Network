It may be getting colder, but the continuing trend for fake tanning shows no signs of cooling off.

Strictly, X Factor and I’m A Celebrity have done much to boost sales of self tanning products and with Christmas parties about to kick off, more bottles will be flying off the shelves as shoppers prepare for the party season.

I used to think I had to spend at least £20 and upwards to get a decent self tanner. The earliest budget self tanners produced unattractive tangerine hues that were less than lovely and don’t even think about the unforgettable whiff of some of the first self-tanning products - seriously stinky.

Cheap and cheerful? Elsa McAlonan puts the new Anovia £1 fake tan to the test for Femail

But the quality (and smell, thankfully) of products under £10 is improving all the time - Cocoa Brown (the tan pictured here) is an affordable self tanning range that is proving a winner with self-tanning fans.

Despite the lower price tags, some of these budget self tanners are proving every bit as good as the premium ranges.

And now there's an even cheaper range to try. Love the Tan (a range of four products that cost £1 each) has just been launched by Anovia, the low-cost skin and body range, which is developed and manufactured in the UK.

All products are ph balanced and enriched with active natural ingredients that are kind to skin. But I thought this sounded too good to be true, so decided to try them.

Bargain beauty: Anovia's £1 tanning range includes moisturiser, primer and smooth-on instant bronzer

Elsa's favourite: Femail's tester adored the self tan moisturiser and said it didn't streak

LOVE THE TAN EXFOLIATING PRIMER

You should always exfoliate before applying self tanner, so it is well worth using this in your tanning routine.

For best results, massage into damp skin and rinse off thoroughly. Pat skin dry before applying tanner. It does the job well, smells pleasant and is not too granular, so gentle on the skin.LOVE THE TAN SELF MOISTURISER

This is enriched with cocoa butter and vitamin E and works in three hours to produce a natural glow. Available in either light/medium or medium/dark.

Amazingly it didn’t streak. I tried light/medium, which was dark enough for my skin tones. I think the medium/dark would have been too dark and not natural looking.

LOVE THE TAN SMOOTH ON INSTANT BRONZER

I prefer wash off bronzing gels if I just need a bit of colour on my arms or legs. Go easy when you open the tube as it comes out in a huge globby chocolate sauce spurt. 

For best results exfoliate first definitely use an application mitt or gloves with this – the colour is good and it certainly looks natural. It comes off easily with soap and water, but be warned – it takes a bit of rubbing to remove it.

Love the Tan is a collection of self-tanning products available for only £1* each and all available to buy now at Poundland.

FASTEST WORKING: Cocoa Brown 1 Hour Instant Tan, £7.99 (Superdrug)

This
 is great for last-minute fixes as it dries really quickly. The colour 
goes on evenly, but make sure the skin is prepared first, as it will 
stick to any dry patches. It’s best if washed off after an hour, but 
leave it on for up to three hours for a darker shade.

LONGEST LASTING:Garnier Ambre Solaire Gloss Bronzer Self-Tanning Gel, £8.99 (Boots)

A
 light gel that slides on easily and works well if it’s buffed when 
applying with a mitt – don’t even try applying this with just your 
fingers, as it streaks. Its big advantage is that it lasts well – use 
every day for up to three days and the colour will last for a week.

EASIEST TO APPLY: St Moriz Instant Self-Tanning Mousse Medium, £4.99 (Boots)

This
 mousse is really quick and easy to apply as you can see exactly where 
you’re putting the colour.

This is best applied with gloves so you can 
really blend it into skin and rub away any streaks as you’re applying 
it. You need to keep skin well moisturised and the colour won’t flake 
off, and will fade gradually.

BEST COLOUR: Tanatomicals Self Tan Cream, £6.99 (Superdrug)

This
 is a great range that doesn’t always get the credit it deserves. 
Although creams can sometimes be difficult to apply as they can easily 
streak, you won’t go wrong with this one.

Apply with a tanning mitt and 
it gives a light colour instantly. Leave overnight and you’ll be pale 
golden in the morning – even with fair skins, it won’t leave an orange 
hue.
