The financial problems experienced by middle income families since the economic crash has been exaggerated, according to new research set to be published tomorrow.

The middle classes may have even thrived since the beginning of the economic downturn in 2008, according to the analysis by the Social Market Foundation (SMF).

The independent think tank has used new research to tackle the conception that those on a low to middle income have been struck by a fall in real wages. Instead it claims that more than four in 10 families have moved up the income scale.

The group says that families in the middle 20 per cent of income distribution – the third income bracket – have shown 'remarkable resilience'. 

The report claims that the middle classes
 may have fared well in the recession by adapting their spending on 
food, childcare, and housing.

They tracked this group from the start of the economic downturn in 
2007-08 to 2011-12.

The report, called Riders on the Storm, states that families within this bracket had a 
total pre-tax income of between 26,100 and 
£41,200, including benefits.

It found that more than 40 per cent had stayed within this wage bracket, and 40 per cent had crept into the fourth bracket, with incomes of between £41,200 to £63,000.

Meanwhile 18 per cent had fallen into the two lowest
 income brackets, of £11,700 to £26,100 and below £11,700.

The study is due to be published tomorrow.

The SMF said it had tracked actual working-age households rather than relying on statistical averages and other data to make the findings.

The SMF's director, Emran Mian, said that the middle earners had coped surprisingly well since the beginning of the economic downturn.

Mr Mian said: 'Even in the teeth of the recession, two-fifths of them moved up the income distribution, just as many managed to stay where they were.'

While the study found that today's families have a real income which is 13 per cent lower than in 2007-2008, because wages rose more slowly than inflation, 30 per cent of households had risen  one income group.

Some ten per cent had even jumped from the middle group to the top bracket of earners.

Mr Mian said: 'Families in the middle have adapted to evade the squeeze.

'The super-consumers among them have beaten the market, managing their costs so that they rise by less than inflation.

'We should expand access to consumer data so that everyone can see how they’ve done it.'
