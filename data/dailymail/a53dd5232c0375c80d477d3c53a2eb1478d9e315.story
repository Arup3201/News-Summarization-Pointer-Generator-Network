The grieving father of murdered teenager Georgia Williams last night whispered 'fly with the angels' as he lit a Chinese lantern in his daughter's memory.

Decorated police detective Steven Williams, 56, and his wife Lynette, 51, were joined by hundreds of friends and well-wishers for the moving memorial event just 100 yards from their family home in Wellington, Shropshire.

The memorial came just a few hours after Jamie Reynolds, 22, appeared at Telford Magistrates Court yesterday charged with Georgia's murder after the teenager's body was discovered by a member of the public on Friday afternoon.

He was remanded into custody and will appear at Stafford Crown Court on Tuesday.

The schoolgirl's emotional parents linked arms with Georgia's boyfriend Matthew Bird, 19, and best friend Katy Lafferty, 17, in Bowring Park on Saturday night.

More than 250 friends gathered in the park from 5pm - many bringing Chinese lanterns and wearing flowers in their hair as a tribute to the 17-year-old.

Tearful friends began letting off the lanterns as Georgia's parents arrived at 7.30pm.

The couple were consoled by some of their daughter's closest friends as they watched hundreds of lanterns float above the picturesque park.

Georgia's boyfriend Matthew smiled as he helped friends set off the lanterns - watched on by her parents who shared their memories of her.

One of Georgia's friends said: 'Everyone was so glad when Mr and Mrs Williams turned up. They've had a horrible week just like the rest of us but they have been so brave.

'In a really touching moment, someone handed Mr William's a lantern and he lit it with a match while whispering: "Now you fly with the angels my love".'

'It was a very quiet, beautiful tribute from father to daughter but he managed to smile as the lantern drifted up into the sky.

'The sun was just going down, it was amazing and everyone felt that Georgia was looking down on us. It was lovely.

'No-one stopped crying all day and it was very sad and emotional at the football club but the lantern release had a different feel about it.

'Matt had a smile on his face and it was so nice that her parents saw all her friends smiling as we remembered the many good things about Georgia.

'She was an incredible person and she will never be forgotten, no-one will let that happen.'

Georgia,
a former head girl at her old school, was last seen by her parents on 
Sunday evening when she told them she was going to see friends.

The body of a young female was later found on the Nant-y-Garth pass near 
Wrexham, north Wales, on Friday afternoon.

After the devastating news of her death was 
announced early yesterday, her parents were joined by more than 100 mourners who 
gathered at the Wellington AFC football ground to pay tribute to the 
teenager.

Mr Williams said: 'Today is a day for Georgia and for us to meet her friends and for us all to celebrate her life'

Mr Williams wrote in a book of condolence set up by the club: 'Thank you for being in my life. God bless you.'

Afterwards he said: 'I'm holding it together for Georgia. I'd like to thank everybody who's here for coming down and showing their love for Georgia.

'I don't really want to make any comment other than today is a day for Georgia and for us to meet her friends and for us all to celebrate her life.'

Hundreds of floral tributes were left on the stand, along with teddies and T-shirts.

One message written on a shirt read: 'Georgia Williams, never forgotten' while another said: 'Georgia we love you always'.

A spokesman for the football club said: 'Georgia was introduced to the club by her grandfather and aunt who also volunteer for the club on match days. She was a bright, colourful and polite young lady.

'The club is united in grief but also united in our strength, supports, thoughts and prayers for the family of Georgia.'

Detectives yesterday appealed for members of the public to help track down several of the teenager's missing items - including her clothing.

Specialist officers continued combing Nant-y-Garth pass near Wrexham in North Wales where the teenager's body was discovered by a member of the public on Friday afternoon.

West Mercia Police said they are looking Georgia's leather spotty satchel, makeup bag, Samsung Galaxy Y mobile phone and her black leather jacket which she was wearing when she left her home last Sunday.

Detective Superintendent Adrian McGee, who is leading the investigation, said: 'Despite a man appearing in court charged with Georgia's murder, we still have a lot of work to do.

'The support the public and the media have given to our investigation so far has been fantastic, but we need to ask for their help once more as we try to find these items.

'If anyone is aware of their whereabouts or comes across any suspicious items, particularly in the area between Oswestry, Wrexham and Ruthin in north Shropshire and Denbighshire, then please get in touch.'
