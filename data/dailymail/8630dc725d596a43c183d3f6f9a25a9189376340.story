As the final NFL draft day arrives all eyes will be on AJ McCarron and Michael Sam to see which team will launch their professional careers.

If Sam is called up tonight he will also become the first openly gay football player, after the Missouri linesman announced his sexuality in February.

Alabama quarterback McCarron, who thought he would be picked on the first or second draft days, is also waiting for a team to select him.

In all, 20 players are still waiting to be selected as the NFL draft enters its third and final day at New York's Radio City Music Hall.

Both McCarron - who is engaged to Splash TV star Katherine Webb - and Sam had not counted on being left in the running on the last day.

Sam was expected to go in a middle round, but the 6ft 2in, 255lb linesman has been considered by some teams as too small for a defensive position and not fast enough for an outside linebacker.

If he doesn't make the draft, Sam will become a free agent, leaving him free to sign a deal with any team of his choosing.

When the 23-year-old revealed he was gay in a series of interviews earlier this year, he said: 'I am an openly, proud gay man ... but I know what I want to be ... I want to be a football player in the NFL.'

He added that he chose to go public so he could 'own my truth before anyone breaks a story about me'.

Focus: All eyes will be on Michael Sam on Saturday to see if the defensive end will get the call

NFL executives and coaches have all backed the football player, promising he will be evaluated on athletic ability alone.

'We admire Michael Sam's honesty and courage. Any player with ability and determination can succeed in the NFL.

'We look forward to welcoming and supporting Michael Sam in 2014,' a spokesman for the NFL said in a statement.

However, Chris Kluwe, who used to play for the Minnesota Vikings, said if Sam isn't drafted questions would need to be asked over whether it was because of his sexual orientation.   

'Projectable
 guys who have to change positions are generally drafted in rounds three
 through five,' he told AP.

'A bad combine shouldn't send him out of the
 draft. If that's the precedent and that precedent is not met, then why 
not?'

McCarron has also been anxiously waiting to be selected, after being led to believe he would have been an early pick.

In an interview last month he said NFL executives had said they 'felt like I could go anywhere from 16 to 35. I believe that, too. At the same time, I don’t have my hopes set on anything.'

He has watched as other hot tips have been snapped up, including fellow quarterback Johnny Manziel on day one.

'This is the moment I've dreamed about since I was a kid,' Manziel tweeted on Thursday night. 'So honored to be a Cleveland Brown.'

Florida's Blake Bortles was another quarterback to go on the first night, when the Jacksonville Jaguars made a play for him.

His stunning college student-turned model girlfriend Lindsey Duke was there to cheer him on, tweeting: 'I couldn't be happier' when they found out he had been picked by the Florida team.

Another player selected on the first day was Eric Ebron, who was clearly feeling lucky as he proposed to girlfriend Brittany Rountree at the Empire State Building a few hours before getting the call from the Detroit Lions.

Sam and McCarron aren't the only high-profile names still left on the list for the final draft day is Aaron Murray, who was slated to be a late pick. 

The Georgia quarterback, who dates glamorous Fox29  anchor Kacie McDonnell, is considered a good option for a strong back up.

He headed to Florida on Friday, as he and McDonnell try to relax before the final team decisions are made tonight.

'We’ll do some bowling, eat and just relax pretty much and see what happens,' he told Dog Bytes.

'We’re
 going to ride roller coasters, walk around, have a good time,' he 
added, as the quarterback tried to find a suitable distraction from the 
tension.
