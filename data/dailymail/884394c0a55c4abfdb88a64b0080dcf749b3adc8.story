Seventeen years, five clubs, twenty-three Ireland caps, ten operations, three metal pins – one in his ankle, one in his foot, one in his wrist. 

Five games this season, six months left on a Premier League contract at Burnley. The numbers all add up for Steven Reid.

The body is still aching, the clock is ticking, but that desire to play, to still be relevant, will not go away.

And in Lancashire, nearer to the family home, Reid has found kindred spirits. Younger, yes, but with a manager and among a group of players who are fighting as one against the odds to stay in the Premier League.

'It is just a great atmosphere,' he said. 'At times you would think we were in the top four. I know you get tired of hearing teams in that part of the league saying that. But we come out of meetings feeling on top of the world.

'People have written us off from the start and rightly so because of the financial power of some teams and we have just been promoted but we have use that to our advantage and lads are playing with freedom.

'I enjoy coming in and working in the environment and seeing the hunger of the lads has been so refreshing.

'The back end of last season was tough with the position we were in at West Brom and looking around the dressing room you're asking questions about whether the players around you are giving everything.

'It's nice to go into the dressing room when you know everyone is working their balls off and nothing is being left on the training ground or on the pitch.

'I have been brought in to be a player but the gaffer was keen to have that Premier league experience and maybe to help give guidance to others who have never played at this level.

'And I want to feel I am having an input. I don't want to ever get to the stage where I am having no input on or off the pitch and just dawdling through.

'I have looked to be a good influence, even if it is just showing professionalism in the gym and in training. Hopefully one or two of the younger lads will see things have to be done if you want to play in the Premier league for an amount of time.

'Sometimes it takes a serious injury to give you a wake-up call and make you realise you are not going to go on forever.'

Reid amassed 23 international caps for the Republic of Ireland between 2001 and 2008

Reid has learned that lesson the hard way. By his own admission, he is now obsessed with warm-ups, warm-downs and anything in between. Keeping his body in the right state after 10 operations has become paramount.

Rewind seven years ago to the opening months of Giovanni Trapattoni's reign as Ireland manager.

Reid played centre midfield in the first three games and was outstanding when the World Cup 2010 qualifiers started with wins in Germany and over Georgia and a hard-earned goalless draw in Montenegro.

Trapattoni left Podrica that night believing he had solved Ireland's central midfield problem. Reid left in agony. It was the last time he played for his country.

Reid said: 'I hadn't trained for a couple of days before the Montenegro game because of an on-going problem with my knee. It was swollen on the plane going home and I knew I was in trouble.

'They were probably my three best games for Ireland but I had no idea that it was going to be the end of my international career. Trap played me in centre mid, I felt great and comfortable in that position and was happy with my performances. Unfortunately it was my last.

'I have mixed emotions looking back. It finally looked like I had forged a position in the team and it was looking good for me in that campaign. For it to be the end was tough. And Trap didn't exactly help when he wrote me off as I was recovering and said I wouldn't play at the top level again.'

In fact Reid needed surgery on his knee cartilage, a complication from the cruciate injury and surgery he had a year earlier which had ruled him out for seven months.

He still remembers the day in training. 'I went into a tackle with David Bentley,' he said. 'I felt the crunch straightaway. It was not quite like anything I had encountered before – just a horrible sensation.

'He twisted round on top of me as we tackled and fell and my leg was trapped. I just couldn't do anything to prevent the force of him landing on top of me.

'I knew pretty much straight away it was bad. There was an awkward crunch and it blew up immediately. And you can always tell by the reaction of the physios when they had to test to see whether the cruciate intact. You can tell by their faces that you are in trouble.

'From the moment you start talking football you know how serious the cruciate injury is. That's the one you don't want. It's career threatening, even though the medical side has advanced so much that any decent knee surgeon can do a decent reconstruction and you are up and about pretty quickly.'

But the pain and the swelling would not abate. He travelled to Colorado to see renowned knee surgeon Richard Steadman who delivered more bad news, and booked him in for surgery.

There was then two months of total inactivity for his right leg and by the time he could put weight on it, his muscles had wasted away.

Sam Allardyce eventually decided Reid could move on from Ewood Park, but without Blackburn physios Dave Fevre and Paul Kelly and strength and conditioning coach Adrian Lamb, Reid might never have recovered.

The pair set up the 9am Club at Ewood and got away from the training ground, climbing England's highest mountain Scafell Pike and its sister Great Gable.

Reid said: 'Adrian's family have a farm in the Lake District so he suggested we went up there. The weather was terrible, and Great Gable was really steep and harsh but it was brilliant fun.

'The last seven years have been a constant battle with not only the physical but the mental side of it. When you are constantly doing rehab and coming back from career threatening injuries it takes its toll on the body and mind.

'You have to get your head round it quickly. You know you are going to be out for a while so you have to set targets and just get on with it. It's important to have little bits and pieces to do in the gym, to have a good relationship with the medical staff.

'You hear people say play as long as you can but 10 surgeries starts to take its toll on how you live your daily life.

'It affects when you can go out for a long walk or play football in the garden with the kids because the knee is swollen or you know you have to prepare for a game. It affects family life and what you do on your day off.'

And it's tough turning down thigh traps in the back garden with five-year-old son Harry and older sister Isla.

Harry suffers from a rare and incurable eye condition nystagmus which causes the eyeball to move uncontrollably, resulting in problems with vision, balance and co-ordination, depending on its severity.

Reid, now a patron of the Nystagmus Network, added: 'We have been lucky with the degree of the condition. He's doing really well just now but as things become more serious at school and he develops we are going to have to watch it carefully.

'He is up to every level for a child his age and as he gets older he will need help and guidance in class but he's completely fearless and confident in the playground and playing his football.'
