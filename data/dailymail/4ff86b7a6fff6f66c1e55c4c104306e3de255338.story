A Russian tycoon who was gunned down in front of his luxury London flat two years ago will face an extradition hearing in September over an alleged plot to assassinate a rich banker.

German Gorbuntsov, 48, who was shot six times in a murder attempt in March 2012, is wanted in Moldova to stand trial over the claims.

He was discharged from hospital today after having surgery for his injuries.

Gorbuntsov is accused of ordering the contract killing of businessman Renat Usatiy, in a fight for control of a bank.

He was not required to attend the hearing today  at Westminster Magistrates' Court.

The extradition hearing will take place on September 1 at Westminster Magistrates' Court in front of senior district judge Howard Riddle.

Gorbuntsov went into hiding at a secret address guarded by armed police after the shooting two years ago.

Following the botched murder attempt in March 2012, detectives released CCTV images of a man suspected of carrying out the shooting.

A suspected was seen in Canary Wharf underground station.

Michael Evans, representing Gorbuntsov, said there is an ongoing threat to the defendant’s life.

‘The assassins are still at large, as are the people who instructed them,’ he said.

‘Gorbuntsov’s life could be endangered.’

He added: ‘Gorbuntsov has been in hospital and on bail to the hospital address.

‘It was anticipated he would be in hospital for four weeks for an operation following on from the 2012 assassination attempt.

‘This morning doctors told him he had made a speedy recovery and they want to discharge him today.

‘We would like to make an application to vary bail to his home address with curfew conditions.’

The feud allegedly started after Mr Usatiy bought a stake in Universal Bank in Moldova for £1.2 million at a time when Gorbuntsov was facing debt problems.

Moldovan prosecutors have confirmed their request to Britain to put Mr Gorbuntsov on trial.

There will be a preliminary hearing on August 6.

Gorbuntsov is on bail with a curfew requirement.
