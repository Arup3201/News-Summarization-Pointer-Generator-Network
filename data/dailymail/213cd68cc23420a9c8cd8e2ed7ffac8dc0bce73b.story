Two teenagers convicted of sexually assaulting an elderly woman and then pouring bleach down her throat after breaking into her Southern California home have been sentenced to 30 years in prison.

The 87-year-old woman, named as Jane Doe, told Raymond Miranda, 15, and Ruben Melanson, 16, in court on Friday that they terrorized her, as they were sentenced as adults for the crime that occurred last April.

The boys will remain in custody of the California Department of Juvenile Justice until they turn 18 and then will be transferred to a state prison. They will remain registered as sex offenders for life.

The teenagers pleaded guilty to several charges including robbery last year after forcing their way into the apartment of Doe, a resident at the gated Camelot Retirement Community in Hemet.

Miranda and Melanson, who were aged 14 and 15 at the time of the incident, also admitted to rape, elderly abuse and a gang enhancement during the April 17, 2014 attack, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Prosecutor Sean Crandell from the Riverside District Attorney's Office said it was one of the worst cases he has worked on during his 17-year career.

Both boys were charged with burglary, elder abuse with great bodily injury, sexual penetration with a foreign object by force and rape, according to the Press Enterprise. 

The teenagers reportedly crawled through a window of the woman's home while she was asleep, tied her up, sexually assaulted and beat her using knives and bottles, and poured two bottles of bleach over her body and down her throat, according to prosecutors.

During the sentencing, Doe (above) brought Judge Judith Clark to tears as she told the boys that they did evil things and took away her independence, but said she appreciated Miranda's apology

Nearly unable to breathe, she pulled a cord that alerted the Camelot complex manager who called authorities for help.

Doe had completely stopped breathing by the time responding officers arrived but was revived through CPR. 

The victim was placed in a medically-induced coma following the crime and now has to use a wheelchair and oxygen tank to help her breathe.

Miranda apologized to her for his actions as he cried in court, according to CBS.

He said: 'I'm sorry for going into your house. I don't expect you to forgive me. But I apologize for going to your house. I'm sorry. I truly am. I don't expect you to forgive me.'

During the sentencing, the victim brought Judge Judith Clark to tears as she told the boys that they did evil things and took away her independence, but said she appreciated Miranda's apology.

Doe said: 'Now for the boys, I want them to look at me. I appreciate your apology.

'I want you to look at me and remember me because when you broke into my apartment in April, you terrorized me and also you took away my independence. You did evil things.'

Judge Clark said that she admired Doe for having experienced what she did but still having the courage to come and speak before the court.

Authorities do not usually identify juvenile suspects in criminal cases, however Hemet officials said they named Raymond  Miranda to protect the public, and aid in the capture of Melanson who was at large following the attack in April, according to CBS.

Melanson was eventually taken into custody after being found at a hotel room at the Pechanga Resort and Casino.

Both boys will have to register as sex offenders for life, and it is likely that they will not be released until they are 50 years old.
