Argentine president Cristina Kirchner has branded Falkland Islanders ‘squatters’ after they voted overwhelmingly to remain British.

She stepped up her attacks after all but three of the 1,517 islanders who took part in the referendum said they wanted to remain an ‘overseas territory of the United Kingdom’.

David Cameron welcomed the result and urged Argentina to respect the historic vote.

Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner dismissed the referendum result in the Falkland Islands as 'a parody'

But his call was snubbed by Mrs 
Kirchner in her first comments about the referendum. She spoke out after
 attending the funeral of Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez.

The president used a conference 
speech, in which she was meant to present a plan for the country’s  
science and technology programmes, to criticise the referendum. She 
claimed: ‘It’s like a consortium of squatters voting on whether they’re 
going to continue illegally occupying a building or not. The result was a
 foregone conclusion.’

Mrs Kirchner went on to dismiss the poll as a ‘parody’.

And Alicia Castro, the Argentine 
ambassador to London, claimed the referendum was a ‘ploy’ with no legal 
value. She said: ‘Negotiations are in the islanders’ best interests.

Jubilant: Falkland islanders cheer after hearing the results of the referendum to remain part of Britain

An overwhelming yes: 98.8 per cent of eligible voters in the Falkland Islands voted to remain a part of Britain

‘We respect their identity and their 
way of life and that they want to continue to be British. But the 
territory they occupy is not British.’

Argentina insists that the islands it calls Las Malvinas were forcibly  taken from Argentina by the British in 1833.

Britain says the argument is 
unfounded, because no Argentine civilian population was ever expelled.

Tensions between the two nations have escalated over the possibility of 
lucrative oil reserves in the region, which lie around 8,000 miles from 
the UK in the South Atlantic.

Last month, Argentine foreign 
minister Hector Timerman pulled out of a meeting with William Hague when
 it was revealed that members of the Falklands government would be 
present.

He has now told every Argentine ambassador to denounce the ballot as ‘illegitimate’.

Rafael Correa, the president of Ecuador, has backed the Argentine stance over the referendum.

He said: ‘It’s ridiculous, las 
Malvinas are Argentine and it’s a disgrace that there is a colony on the
 coast of the Americas in the 21st century. We must all rebel against 
this.’

But Mr Hague has called on Argentina to accept the result.

He said: ‘We have always been clear we believe in the rights of the Falklands people to determine their own futures.

‘It is only right that, in the 21st century, these rights are respected.’

And Nigel Haywood, governor of the 
Falkland Islands, said the vote was a ‘massive demonstration of the way 
the Falkland Islanders feel and of the way they see their future’.
