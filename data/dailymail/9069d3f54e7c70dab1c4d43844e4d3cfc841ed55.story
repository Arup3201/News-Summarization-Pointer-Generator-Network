There's no bigger beauty buzzword these days than ‘detox’. From deep-cleansing masks to purging baths, hundreds of treatments promise to cleanse our bodies after over-indulgence.

Some experts warn that much of the beauty detox market is little more than marketing hype. ‘The term detox is a medical term that has been hijacked by marketing departments,’ says nutritionist Henrietta Norton.

'Detox' is the buzzword of the moment, but what does it really mean? And, do the products that claim to having detoxing products really work? 

‘Traditional medical opinion views the term detox as a way to withdraw a potentially lethal toxin from the body such as in those who have abused alcohol or drugs.’

Here, Charlotte Kemp tests the most popular detox beauty products and asks skin, hair and nutrition experts for their verdicts on which might work — and which to ditch.

FOOT FANTASTIC?

Bodytox Detox Foot Patches, £3.99 for a two pack

Bodytox Detox Foot Patches, £3.99 for a two pack, nirvanahealthfood.com

The Claims: Adhesive patches you stick on your feet to stimulate the pressure points on the soles to release the body’s unwanted toxins.

Charlotte says: According to reflexology, stimulating the meridian points on the feet can help to encourage a smooth flow of energy to the major organs of the body. But can what is little more than a plaster achieve what a trained reflexologist can? I applied the patches as directed — one to each foot — and they were moist in the morning. But was this toxins or sweat?

Expert view: ‘Putting a detox patch on your skin may make the covered area sweat more,’ says scientist Harriet Ball of Sense About Science (senseaboutscience.org). ‘While very, very small levels of chemicals may be excreted in the sweat, it won’t have any discernable effect on the amount of chemicals in your body.’

DIGESTION TEA

Pukka Detox Tea With Lemon, £1.89 for 20 sachets

The Claims: A blend of organic aniseed, fennel & cardamom — natural ingredients said to ease digestion.

Charlotte says: I certainly felt virtuous sipping this herbal brew instead of my morning caffeine fix. It’s an acquired taste — I felt a little nauseous after the first cup — but it grows on you (think aniseed balls dropped in hot water) and it has to be better than my numerous cups coffee and tea all day.

Expert view: ‘The spices in this have been traditionally used to support the digestive system and the adrenal glands — our internal stress management system,’ says nutritionist Henrietta Norton of Wild Nutrition. ‘The digestive system has a central role in the effective elimination of waste presented to the gut from the liver.’

PURGING BATH

Ina Crystals White Gold Detoxifying Crystal Salts, £47 for 1000g

Ina Crystals White Gold Detoxifying Crystal Salts, £47 for 1000g

The Claims: These bath salts contain minerals small enough to penetrate skin cells and be absorbed to help the skin expel internal toxins accumulated through alcohol and a hectic lifestyle.

Charlotte says: For optimum results, the blurb recommends tipping the entire lot into the bath, which feels rather decadent at £47 a pot, and brushing the skin with the bath mitt included. Can this counter-act a month of drinking? Not sure. My skin felt wonderfully soft but surely you could get similar results by adding a couple of scoops of Epsom Salts at a fraction of the price?

Expert view: Dr Sam Bunting (drsambunting.com) isn’t convinced the ingredients will detox the body in a medical sense. ‘We do not eliminate toxins like alcohol through the skin — we do it through the liver and it’s a very efficient organ at doing so,’ she says. It will soften the skin, though.

PERFECT PORES 

Ren Invisible Pores Detox Mask, £18 for 50ml

Ren Invisible Pores Detox Mask, £18 for 50ml, renskincare.com

The Claims: A deep cleansing face mask, formulated with French clay to draw out impurities and reduce pore size by removing excess sebum (an oily secretion produced naturally to lubricate skin) and removing dead skin cells.

Charlotte says: My skin felt smoother afterwards and feels less bumpy, but I still have some yucky blackheads

Expert view: The clay will help absorb excess oil, says Dr Bunting. ‘This will reduce the appearance of pores temporarily. But it won’t pull toxins out of the skin. Those with sensitive skin need to be careful as this can be quite drying,’

SUPER SHAMPOO

Toni & Guy Cleanse, £6.49 for 250ml

Toni & Guy Cleanse, £6.49 for 250ml, hairmeetswardrobe.co.uk

The Claims: A deep clean shampoo for overstyled hair — recommended for occasional use to remove dirt, product build up and residue

Charlotte says: This is applied like a normal shampoo and my hair certainly felt less sticky afterwards.

Expert view: Trichologist Glenn Lyons, clinical director at Philip Kingsley, is not convinced. ‘Every shampoo will cleanse and clean the hair. In my opinion, the word detox is a fashionable term and a marketing ploy. This product does no more than a cheap shampoo from a supermarket. It is more important to choose a product developed to suit your hair type. That will make a bigger difference as will washing the hair more frequently.’

NAIL THE TREND

The claims: Described as a detox for the nails, this is based on a Japanese manicure technique to enhance the natural pinky colour of nails by buffing without chemical-laden polishes.

Charlotte says: After buffing with emery paper, you apply powder and then wax made of natural ingredients to soften the cuticles and leave nails a soft pink colour.

Expert view: ‘We have a tendency to abuse our nails with all sorts of extensions, acrylic, semi permanent gel or toxic nail polish,’ says nail guru Sonia Hully of Nailberry (nailberry.co.uk). ‘The P-Shine manicure will help smooth, invigorate and improve the natural lustre of nails leaving them glowing and shiny,’ she says.

AMAZING OIL

Neal’s Yard Detox Toning Oil, £15 for 100ml

Neal’s Yard Detox Toning Oil, £15 for 100ml nealsyardremedies.com

The claims: This body oil contains the essential oils used for lymphatic drainage by aromatherapists and with regular use can help to eliminate toxins from the body

Charlotte says: To get best results, it’s recommended to use this after body brushing and a warm bath or shower which is all quite a faff. As directed, I tried to massage as vigorously as I could, concentrating on all the flabby bits like thighs and tummy.

Expert view: ‘I think the vigorous massage is likely to be the most helpful element here — that could encourage lymphatic drainage,’ says Dr Bunting. ‘The aromatherapy aspect will improve the sensorial aspect of the ritual — but it won’t help with toxin elimination.’

COLON CLEANSE

Organic Pharmacy Colon Cleanse and Gut Repair Capsules, £29.95 for 60 capsules, theorganicpharmacy.com

The claims: Natural ingredients such as burdock root, leaves from the alfalfa plant, apple pectin and licorice help detoxify and rejuvenate the body at a cellular level. Claims clients have reported weight loss, better digestion and glowing skin

Charlotte says: Popping three of these every night is quite an ordeal. I can report that I was more ‘regular’ within a day or two but my skin isn’t glowing yet.

Expert view: Nutritionist Henrietta Norton confirms that the ingredients ‘primarily offer fibre’. She adds: ‘There is no scientific evidence that these ingredients will improve skin, energy, mental clarity or weight but a well functioning gastro-intestinal tract can support good health.’
