The rich and famous of Beverley Hills are experiencing a nanny crisis and the lack of talent is forcing up salaries for the elite in childcare, claims a leading nanny recruitment firm.

Beverley Hills nanny: The rich and famous are experiencing a nanny crisis and the lack of talent is forcing up salaries

Julie Swales from the nanny recruitment firm The Elizabeth Rose Agency told ABC that she knows nannies working in Beverley Hills who can charge as much as much $270,000 for just three days work a week.

Not only are these super nannies working for the super wealthy they are extremely well off themselves with million dollar mortgages, plus perks of the job including pass me down Prada dresses and ball gowns.

Agency boss Jack Lippman revealed that a current trend is for nannies who are trilingual with Mandarin especially popular. He says he's even had requests for scuba-certified nannies before. 

In San Francisco Mormon nannies are very popular because concerned parents don’t have to worry about what they get up to outside of their job.

Lana Fuchs hired a nanny for her pet monkey, while Robin Williams married his son's nanny Marsha Garces

The agency claims it is struggling to meet demand from its demanding clients who only want the best for their precious children.

A
 common mistake that some budding nannies make is being too pretty for 
the lady of the house who tends to have final say on who gets hired.

Many
 wives are concerned about hiring attractive nannies after infamous
high profile cases of affairs including Robin Williams married his son's nanny Marsha Garces in 1989 and Jude Law who admitted to an affair with his children's nanny and apologised to fiancee Sienna Miller.

The Elizabeth Rose Agency warns wannabe nannies to wear limited makeup and avoid sexy clothes if they want to get hired.

Sin
 City Rules reality TV star Lana Fuchs had a different criteria when 
hiring a nanny for her pet monkey – Prince Mikey – who requires three 
baths a day and regular treats.

The show also featured a man who so 
despaired at trying to find the right childcare that he started a 
website allowing parents to post reviews about their help.

Nate Poupko created the Nannyreviews.com site after experiencing difficulties in finding staff he could trust with his family

When Nate Poupko moved his family to Santa Monica he and his wife knew very few people in the city. With three children under two-years old, the couple approached several local nanny agencies to find quality care.

The parents despaired after time and again getting disappointing candidates. Many nannies lacked appropriate qualifications or credentials.

'I've had nannies ask for six figures and benefits. I was like, hell, I want that job,' said Popupko.

While other product and services such as restaurants and contractors had online review sites, there was no such forum for nannies, so he launched Nannyreviews.com.

The site has blossomed into an online forum that connects nannies and parents with a wealth of resources and reviews to make the relationship between nannies and families successful and rewarding.

He finally found what he was looking for – a house keeper, two baby nurses and a nanny - but also has cameras in every room in his house so he and his wife can view what their nanny and baby nurses are up to reading several horror stories in the press about nannies abusing the children in their care.
