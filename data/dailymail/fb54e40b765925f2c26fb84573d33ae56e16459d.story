Andy Carroll has revealed that Stewart Downing's form for West Ham this season has led the winger to compare himself to Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs.

Downing has been instrumental for West Ham as Sam Allardyce's side have been one of the surprise packages of the season as the east London club chase a European place.

The former Liverpool midfielder has netted five times in the Premier League this campaign, including during Sunday's 3-0 win against Hull, and assisted another seven goals for his team-mates.

And striker Carroll, who also found the target last weekend, has revealed that Downing's resurgence in form might've gone to his head.

'Stewie is a fantastic player, Carroll told the club's official website. 'He was hinting that he's the new Ryan Giggs, which the lads were giving him stick for. He's a great player and it suits him very nice in that hole.' 

Carroll has been in good form himself for the Hammers after missing the first three months of the season with injury and, after  turning home the rebound after an Enner Valencia shot against Hull, the England front man praised the work Teddy Sheringham has been doing with him on the training ground.

'That's what we've been doing in training with Teddy - a lot of finishing and following-up,' Carroll said. 'That is just another one of his sessions which happens, with Enner shooting and me following in and I had a little tap-in.

'I don't normally score many of them, so it was nice to get one. I feel good and five goals in eight games sounds good, so hopefully there is a lot more to come.'
