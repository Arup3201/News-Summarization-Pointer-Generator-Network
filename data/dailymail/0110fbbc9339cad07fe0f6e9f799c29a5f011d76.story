Serena Williams recovered from a nightmare start to overcome her compatriot Sloane Stephens and reach the quarter-finals of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells.

The world No 1 dropped her first two service games in the fourth career meeting between two former friends, whose relationship had cooled in the wake of Stephens' solitary win at the 2013 Australian Open.

Despite dropping the opening set on a tie-break after rallying to recover the double break, Williams became increasingly dominant as the game went on and secured a 6-7 (7/3), 6-2, 6-2 win in two hours and seven minutes.

It proved a much tougher challenge for Williams - making her first appearance in Indian Wells in 14 years - than her 53-minute triumph over Zarina Diyas in the previous round.

Shocked by Stephens' strong start, Williams battled back to level but the world number 42 dominated the tie-break to raise hopes of levelling the career wins between the pair at two apiece.

Williams had other ideas, breaking her opponent early in the second set and refusing to allow Stephens a single break point chance before she served out confidently to level the match.

A rattled Stephens dropped her serve again in the first game of the decider and when Williams broke again to go 5-2 ahead it was only a matter of time before she completed her comeback victory.
