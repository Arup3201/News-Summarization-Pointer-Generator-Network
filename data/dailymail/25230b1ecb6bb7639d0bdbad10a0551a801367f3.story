A former Disney marketing executive has written a tell-all memoir about his sexual exploits - with graphic detail about stars including actor Alan Cumming and Olympic figure skater Johnny Weir.

Josh Sabarra, 39, gushes about his numerous liaisons since losing his virginity at 31 in a new book titled Porn Again: A Memoir.

He also tears apart his former best friend, Hairspray actress Ricki Lake, and recounts scandalous nights with an anonymous 'household name' character actress in the book that has set tongues wagging in Beverly Hills.

In one chapter titled Cumming Of Age, the PR company director goes into vivid, complimentary description about The Good Wife actor Alan Cumming.

The pair, he explains, met at a party with Ricki Lake.

They then relocated to the trendy West Hollywood hotel Chateau Marmont for an encounter that takes several paragraphs to describe.

Johnny Weir is his second high-profile target.

Readers learn he had little in common with the reality star and Olympic competitor who he met through Elton John. 

The sex, however, was perfect, according to Hollywood Reporter.

Flattery aside, Sabarra reserves his wrath for Ricki Lake, who allegedly had him fired when her talk show flopped.

He seeks revenge by describing the way she boasted about having unprotected sex, and the day she took a picture of herself squatting in the woods.  

The tales are just a fraction of Sabarra's revelations - but many of his Hollywood friends are spared being named.

He once bedded a straight man who is cryptically referred to as 'Famous Actor'.

One unidentified character - dubbed 'Ms TV Personality' - once got so drunk she fished a $100 bill out of a toilet, he claims.

In another scathing chapter of the book, released November 4, he describes how 'Ms Character' has been reduced to Hallmark movies.
