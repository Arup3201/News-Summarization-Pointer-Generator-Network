Manchester United will step up their pursuit of Southampton full-back Luke Shaw after England’s final World Cup group game against Costa Rica on Tuesday evening.

Former United manager David Moyes did much of the ground-work to convince the 18-year-old that his future lies at Old Trafford before he was sacked at the end of April and it is understood that a wage package has been agreed that would make Shaw the highest earning youngster at Old Trafford, with a weekly salary approaching £100,000-a-week.

United made their first move with a £27million offer towards the end of May but progress stalled after the two clubs failed to push through the signing before Shaw’s involvement in the World Cup, while Southampton’s change of manager adding to the complications.

Southampton, now managed by Ronald Koeman, are under no financial pressure to sell and they are holding out for a figure closer to the £30million mark, with Shaw’s employers aware that they have the best young left-back in the world on their hands.

New manager Louis van Gaal is aware of the need for reinforcements in the United back-line and although Patrice Evra has been retained for one more year, the Dutchman is aware that the 33-year-old cannot be expected to play almost every game as he did last season under Moyes.

Current understudy Alex Buttner will be moved on this summer, with Dynamo Moscow in pole position to sign the left-back.

It leaves United in urgent need of a new full-back and they have been encouraged that the player has made it clear to Southampton that he would like a move to United to go through and executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward will look to secure the England star’s signature once England return from Brazil on Wednesday.

United will not, however, be held to ransom and if negotiations were to slow down once more, they may be forced to look at alternatives, with Ajax’s Daley Blind emerging as a £12.5million target following his impressive performances for Van Gaal’s Holland at the World Cup.

United, meanwhile, will wait until after the World Cup to make a formal offer in the region of £9million to Arsenal for defender Thomas Vermaelen. The Belgian defender is privately confident that personal terms are in place with the Old Trafford club, with Vermaelen’s contract at Arsenal expiring next summer.

The 28-year-old’s close friendship with Robin van Persie is believed to have helped matters, while United see the move as a pragmatic solution to the void of Premier League experience that has been left following the departures of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic.
