A witness at the trial of PR guru Max Clifford has told the court he has a 'freakishly small' penis.

The woman, who is not one of the publicist's seven accusers, spoke about the size of his manhood after conflicting claims earlier in the trial.

The court also heard claims Clifford 
promised to introduce one of his secretaries to pop icon David Bowie in 
return for sexual favours.

Jurors were then told he posed as the film director Michael Winner and told young 
women to go into his offices in short skirts and no knickers.

The size of Clifford's penis was discussed today after a former model giving evidence last week claimed he had showed her his genitals and said: 'How can I satisfy a woman with this?'

Publicist Max Clifford arrives at Southwark Crown Court this morning, where he denies 11 counts of indecent assault against seven women and girls

Clifford's legal team had insisted that his penis was 'average-sized' and the witness must be lying.

Speaking today, another woman told Southwark Crown Court she had described Clifford’s penis as 'freakishly small'.

Asked by Rosina Cottage QC, prosecuting, to give more details, she wept and said: 'I feel like I’m being really rude about someone.'

She added: 'It’s no more than two and a half inches.'

She also told the court that during a meeting at Clifford's office in 1982, he walked around his desk, took his trousers down and stood with his back against the door.

She said she complied with his wish for her to masturbate him, saying: 'I was out of my depth, it seemed like the easiest option, to comply.'

She said the incident made her angry, adding: 'I’ve been angry about it, more than upset, because of the way I’d been coerced, used, and I had been a laughing stock.'

The court heard claims that Clifford pushed a woman up against a wall near his office and moved his hand up her side

Cross examined by Richard Horwell QC, defending, she added: 'He was a powerful man, and I was a failed model.'

Another woman, one of the alleged victims in the case, also told the court today that Clifford pinned her against a wall and pushed his tongue into her mouth when she was 19.

She said he put his hand on her waist before moving it up towards her breast in the incident just outside his office.

The woman, who managed to wriggle free, then saw him on a later occasion apparently being given oral sex by his secretary, the court heard.

The woman told the court she used to work in an office near Clifford’s in the 1970s and would show people to Clifford’s office when they had meetings with him.

She said that one evening at about 5pm, she went to collect any post from Clifford’s office before going home.

She said: 'As I was walking down the corridor, he came out of his office, walked a couple of steps, and then suddenly veered towards me, quite quickly, pushed me up against the wall, and sort of pinned me there, with his body.

'He pushed his tongue into my mouth and tried to French kiss me.'

She added: 'He had one hand on the wall, and the other started moving up my side, and started to touch me.

'I made an effort to wriggle and turn and I went under his arm, which was up against the wall, and I walked off and back to my office.'

After that, she felt uncomfortable at work, the court heard, but she was buying a house and did not want to cause any trouble.

Not long afterwards, she walked to his office again, and pushed open the door, which was slightly ajar, she said.

'I saw his secretary, she was on her knees, she appeared to be giving him oral sex while he was in the chair,' she told the court.

'I was quite shocked, backed away very quickly, and went back to my desk.'

Defence QC Mr Horwell, cross-examining, suggested that she had not worked in an office that shared space with Clifford, but the woman replied: 'Yes, I have.'

Mr Horwell then suggested that the incident outside Clifford’s office had never occurred and she responded: 'I’d have to be completely mad, wouldn’t I? I’m not mad, and it did happen.'

One of Clifford's former secretaries, whose allegations do not form part of the charges against Clifford, later gave evidence.

She told the court Clifford would often expose himself and bragged about 'screwing women'.

She said the office was 'very sexually orientated' and 'sexual banter' was rife.

She said: 'Sex appeared to be on his mind most of the time.

'I would sometimes listen to him on the phone and he would pretend to be Michael Winner.

'He would say to them (women) he wanted to play a trick on Max, and if they went into the into the office and were wearing a really short skirt and no knickers and a low top it would help with his trick he wanted to play on him.'

She added: 'He would brag quite a lot about how he screwed them.'

She said there was an unwritten rule that you never opened Clifford's door if it was shut.

But she once accidentally saw the media mogul having a sex with a woman in his office when late comedian Lennie Bennett opened the office door.

She said: 'There was one occasion when the door was shut and Lennie Bennett came into the office and had marched into the office opening the door and he (Clifford) was up against the wall with a girl.

'The girl was leaning against the wall. I remember she had her legs around him and his trousers and pants, I don't know whether they were off.'

The woman said that Clifford once said he would introduce her to David Bowie in return for sexual favours.

She said: 'I was a massive David Bowie fan and I went to two of his concerts during the time I was working there.

'He offered for me to meet to meet David Bowie but only on the condition I have him a blowjob.

'I didn't give him a blowjob and I didn't meet David Bowie.'

She claimed she had to pleasure Clifford on a string of occasions when they were alone in the office, and he once 'fondled' her breasts.

The woman, who is now in her fifties, said: 'I felt I had no choice, I was very naive...I had come straight from school and with the whole atmosphere in the office I felt I had no choice.'

During cross-examination, Mr Horwell QC, defending, accused the woman of making the stories up.

But she insisted she was telling the truth, telling jurors: 'I wouldn't tell any lies. I don't lie.'

Clifford, 70, from Hersham in Surrey, is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault against seven women and girls. He denies all the charges. The trial continues.
