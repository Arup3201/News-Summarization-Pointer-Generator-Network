'(Mamales) had made a threat that he should kill the whole family and that he may just start with (Derek), as he grabbed the boy and left,' said Tooele Police Captain, Paul Wimmer.

Police launched a search for the 'endangered and missing child', which saw the activation of Utah's Child Response Abduction Response Team and an 'amber alert' issued. 

But now, Derek has been found and reunited with his mother and sisters after a  police K9 tracked him and Mamales to a shed near the house in East Vine Street.

The bloodhound, named Max, had been dispatched with trainer Alan Honsaker, a member of South Salt Lake's K9 unit, as part of the rescue attempt.

He was given a paper bag to sniff to learn the missing boy's scent, before tracing it to the shed, where Mamales was hiding with Derek, at around midday yesterday.

'Max was able to walk into the track at that point and take me to where the suspect was hiding,' Mr Honsaker told Fox 13.  

Following the discovery, Mamales was promptly arrested, while Derek, who was found in 'a good condition' and eating candy, was returned to his family.

Max, who has been finding missing children in Utah for more than eight years, was later given 'a big handful of juicy treats and a lot of attention' for his efforts.

Mamales, who shares custody of Derek, often brings the boy to the house he shares with his daughters - Tiffany and Samantha - at weekends.

But on Friday night, the boy's mother tried to take him home after deciding Mamles was behaving 'erratically', police said.

The suspect, described as 'very toxic' by his daughter Samantha, is alleged to have a history of drug abuse and bipolar disorder.

Another daughter Lindsi Mamales told KSL.com: 'I know he loves us, he just gets off his rocker without his meds.'

Mamales was arrested ye By Saturday evening, police were still in the process of booking him into the Tooele County Jail.

Police said they are unsure of the charges Mamales may face as the investigation is still ongoing.
