Australia is one of the world's top tourists destinations but overseas travellers are being warned of natural disasters, homophobic attacks, sexual assaults and super strong alcohol.

Warnings issued by travel advisories have posted some threats posed by native animals, bushfires, tropical cyclones, flooding, dust storms, criminals targetting foreigners, as well as homophobic crimes in rural towns.

The Daily Telegraph reports the UK are among the most alarmist, advising travellers 'there are still isolated incidents of homophobic crimes. Take care when visiting small rural communties.

'There have been some serious sexual assaults against British nationals in Australia,' the warning reads.

'Take care in the town centre of Alice Springs at night. If you are going to drink, know your limit. Drinks served in bars are often stronger than those in the UK.'

The US warns against scuba diving as 'numerous deaths related to diving incidents in the last few years.

'Fauna can be dangerous, from jellyfish off the Great Barrier Reef to Crocodiles, sharks, poisonous insects and snakes,' the US warning reads.

'Many downtown areas were built in the 1800s and can have narrow sidewalks crowded with pedestrians.'

A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs said the Australian Government had no input into advisories prepared by other countries.

US sitcom Modern Family filming their Australian episode was memorable both in terms of their reception here and also the incredible exposure they received internationally

Tourism Australia managing director John O'Sullivan said 'well-intended advice was only one source of information for travellers.

'There are myriad sources of information they'll be drawing from, including friends, colleagues, social media networks and travel and peer review websites,' he said.

Mr O'Sullivan added, 'Oprah's Ultimate Australian Adventure', US sitcom Modern Family and the British royal visit generated enormous international exposure for Australia which expected to translate into increased international visitors in time.

'These visits are always special affairs but these three particular visits were especially memorable both in terms of their reception here in Australia and also the incredible exposure they received internationally.

'The spectacular footage and photos of the visit by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to Uluru, for example, saw daily enquiries to Australia.com increase 125%. And I know Voyages and Longitude 131, who run the accommodation and tours in central Australia experienced spikes in enquiries and bookings," he said.

'I have no doubt that we're going to see a positive impact on visitor arrivals, especially from the US and the UK, two of our largest volume and most valuable traditional markets.'

Mr O'Sullivan said recent figures show Australians are enjoying record-breaking inbound tourism numbers and travellers were finding plenty of positive reasons to visit.

International visitor arrivals increased by 500,000 in the year to June 30, to 6.65 million - up 7.9 per cent on the previous year.
