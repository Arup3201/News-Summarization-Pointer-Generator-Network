'Colourful past': Prince Andrew has been controversially elected to the fellowship of the Royal Society

Founded in 1660, the Royal Society brings together luminaries of the scientific world.

The cosmologist Stephen Hawking, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the internet, and Sir John Sulston, who oversaw the human genome project, are among its current fellows.

Now they have been joined by someone with a rather less distinguished scientific background.

Prince Andrew, who gained six O-levels and three A-levels (in English, history and politics) before going to the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, has been elected a fellow.

But his selection to the prestigious role has caused a revolt at the society. Critics have highlighted his 'over-colourful past', and lack of a scientific background.

They have told Royal Society president Sir Paul Nurse they oppose the choice of the Duke and have also questioned the validity of the election.

Rebels claim the use of ballot papers that carried only a Yes box meant the only way to vote against the Duke was to spoil it, so they had no way of preventing him being chosen.

But the society claims fellows were offered advice on how to vote against. Results of the ballot announced on Friday showed he won the role with votes from only 11 per cent of the electorate, with a huge number of abstentions.

Only 147 fellows out of some 1,300 had voted for the prince with 24 spoilt papers against. Some 1,128 fellows abstained.

The rebellion is being led by David Colquhoun, a society fellow and professor of pharmacology at University College London. 'The Royal Society was founded to advocate the idea that science is what matters, not deference to authority,' he said.

'The exception to that seems to be deference to “royal blood”, but it is taking deference too far to elect Prince Andrew.'

Prof Colquhoun highlighted some 
controversial aspects of the Duke's 'over-colourful past' including the 
sale of his former home, Sunninghill Park, to Timur Kulibayev, the 
son-in-law of the Kazakh president, for £3million above the £12million 
asking price.

The Duke was nominated by the 
society's ruling council. Last night a spokesman for the society said 
Prof Colquhoun and other critics were 'in a minority'.

Bill Hartnett said: 'The Duke was 
nominated because of the huge support he has shown to British scientists
 and the development of British science.

'The Duke has been very supportive of
 young British scientists, hosting events and attending events at the 
society, and he has been instrumental in bridging the gap between 
academic science in Britain and British industry.'

Prince Andrew joins his father Prince
 Philip, siblings Prince Charles and Princess Anne and nephew Prince 
William as royal fellows. The Queen is the society's patron.

Mr Hartnett added: 'We have a very strong link with the Royal Family. That is why we are the Royal Society.'
