Attorney General Eric Holder has told the Russian government that the U.S. will not seek the death penalty for former National Security Agency systems analyst Edward Snowden.

In a letter dated July 23, the attorney general said the criminal charges Snowden faces do not carry the death penalty and that the U.S. will not seek the death penalty even if Snowden were charged with crimes that are eligible for such punishments.

Before the news of the letter broke, Edward’s father Lonnie Snowden showed his undying support for his son, saying: ‘I believe when my son takes his final breath, whether it’s today or 100 years from now, he will be comfortable with what he did.’

The elder Snowden told The Today Show that he shares his son’s outrage about the government surveillance program, the funding for which was just renewed in spite of the leaked material.

‘I am extremely disappointed and angry. I'm an angry American citizen,’ he told Matt Lauer Friday morning.

‘I’ve watched closely the balance of the 36 members on the two intelligence committees within Congress, particularly, and the American people don’t know the whole truth, but the truth is coming.’

This is the leaker’s father’s second interview with NBC and he said that while he still has not had direct contact with his son, he has changed his tune when it comes to Wikileaks.

Late last month, Lonnie expressed concern that Edward was being manipulated, but they seem to have helped ease those concerns.

‘I'm thankful for anybody at this point who is providing him with assistance, to keep him safe and secure, and so if Wikileaks is doing that, I'm thankful for that,’ he said.

Holder's letter is part of an ongoing campaign by the U.S. government to get Snowden back.

Holder says his letter follows news reports that Snowden, who leaked information on largely secret electronic surveillance programs, has filed papers seeking temporary asylum in Russia on grounds that if he were returned to the United States, he would be tortured and would face the death penalty.

The attorney general's letter was sent to Alexander Vladimirovich Konovalov, the Russian minister of justice.

The attorney general's letter may allay reported Russian concerns about how Snowden might be treated if he is deported to America.

Some Russian politicians, including parliament speaker Sergei Naryshkin, have said Snowden should be granted asylum to protect him from the death penalty.

If Snowden were to go to a country that opposes the death penalty, providing assurances that the U.S. won't seek that punishment may remove at least one obstacle to his return.

'I can report that the United States is prepared to provide to the Russian government the following assurances regarding the treatment Mr. Snowden would face upon return to the United States,' Holder wrote.

'First, the United States would not seek the death penalty for Mr. Snowden should he return to the United States.'

'Mr. Snowden will not be tortured. Torture is unlawful in the United States,' Holder's letter said.

The attorney general said that if Snowden returned to the U.S. he would promptly be brought before a civilian court and would receive 'all the protections that United States law provides.'

Holder also said that 'we understand from press reports and prior conversations between our governments that Mr. Snowden believes that he is unable to travel out of Russia and must therefore take steps to legalize his status. That is not accurate; he is able to travel.'

Careful: Snowden was accompanied by his lawyer during the interview

Despite the revocation of Snowden's passport on June 22, Snowden remains a U.S. citizen and is eligible for a limited validity passport good for direct return to the United States, said the attorney general.

A spokesman for President Vladimir Putin said Russia has not budged from its refusal to extradite Snowden.

Snowden, who is believed to have been staying at the Moscow airport transit zone since June 23, applied for temporary asylum in Russia last week. The United States wants him sent home to face prosecution for espionage.

Asked by a reporter whether the government's position had changed, Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies that 'Russia has never extradited anyone and never will.'

There is no U.S.-Russia extradition treaty.

Peskov also said that Putin is not involved in reviewing Snowden's application or discussions of the ex-NSA contractor's future with the U.S., though the Russian Security Service, the FSB, had been in touch with the FBI.
