Marcos Maidana took dirty to a new level on Saturday night as he bit Floyd Mayweather during their WBA and WBC welterweight championship rematch. Mayweather regained his titles, and Maidana's excuse was peculiar.

‘No, no. [I didn't bite him],' he said.  ‘Perhaps he put his glove in my mouth. Maybe he thinks I’m a dog.’

We have been here before when it comes to biting and excuses, so Sportsmail looks at the other scandals and the 'reasons' behind them.

Mike Tyson (Evander Holyfield, 1997)

Driven by his 'determination to win' Tyson brought biting scandals to a whole new level in his world heavyweight rematch against Evander Holyfield. The controversial star bit a chunk out of Holyfield's ear and was disqualified.

Speaking to Oprah Winfrey in 2009, Tyson said Holyfield headbutted him a lot in both fights, and he was so angry that 'Holyfield was such a great fighter', he would do anything to beat him. Tyson apologised eventually and the bite-ee surprisingly accepted it despite his scar.

Luis Suarez (Ottman Bakkal, 2010, Branislav Ivanovic, '13, Giorgio Chiellini, '14)

It would be a bite-size article if it wasn't for Luis Suarez. First, the Uruguayan attacked Bakkal in a game between Ajax and PSV, while his nibble on Ivanovic in the Premier League got the English press on his back. His latest bite on Giorgio Chiellini prompted his longest ban, and the oddest excuse.

'After the impact … I lost my balance, making my body unstable and falling on top of my opponent,' he said. 'At that moment I hit my face against the player, leaving a small bruise on my cheek and a strong pain in my teeth.'

Luis Suarez's first biting incident came against PSV with Ottman Bakkal in 2010

Francisco Gallardo (Jose Antonio Reyes, 2001)

We can almost see the reasoning behind biting an opponent (almost), but doing it your team-mate? On his testicles? The incident happened after Reyes scored a wonderful goal for Sevilla against Valladolid, with Gallardo celebrating with the youngster in an extremely odd fashion.

'I don't think what I did was very noteworthy,' Gallardo told Spanish media. 'It was meant as a joke. A teammate gave the idea. If I had known what a fuss it would cause...'

Reyes said he felt a 'slight pinch', and added: 'Gallardo hasn't heard the end of this. The worst thing now is the stick I'm getting from the other players.'

Jermain Defoe (Javier Mascherano, 2006)

During a Premier League game between Tottenham and West Ham, Defoe was upset of the treatment he was getting from the hosts' midfielders and took out his frustration on the Argentine, though Martin Jol said he did so in a 'comical' fashion and it was simply a nibble...

Defoe protested: 'This has been blown out of all proportion,'  'The referee was standing right over me and if he felt I had done anything bad he would have sent me off.' He received no ban.

Wayne Monte 'Tree' Rollins (Danny Ainge)

Tree Bites Man was the headline in the Boston Herald, the public were shocked. That was after the NBA play-off between Boston and Atalanta, when Rollins bit Ainge's finger in a brawl. The latter required stitches.

Rollins was nicknamed the intimidator as well as Tree because of his height, and was apparently irate after Ainge called him a 'sissy'. No excuse for the bite though.

Alex Burrows (Patrice Burgeron, 2011)

During a Stanley Cup finals game between Vancouver Canucks and the Boston Bruins (what is it with Boston and biting?) Burrows appeared to bite down on Bergeron's finger in a customary ice hockey brawl. No action was taken because of a lack of evidence but the victim was irate.

Burrows said: 'He had his finger in my mouth but I don't think I bit him. You saw it, he put his hand up and he put his hand in my face and his finger got in my mouth, so that's what happened.'
