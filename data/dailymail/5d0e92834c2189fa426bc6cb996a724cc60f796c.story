An ugly feud over an $8billion fortune amassed by the family who control the Orkin pest control empire is set to come to a head in a bitter court battle.

The grandchildren of company founder Wayne Rollins, who went from rural poverty in Depression-era Georgia to owning America's biggest extermination firm, have rounded on their father and uncle, who now control the company.

The four children of Gary Rollins, the CEO of Rollins Inc., which owns all of Orkin's 400 locations and nine other pest control businesses - are suing him and his brother Randall over their inheritance.

The suit has been brought by Glen Rollins, 45, his brother Wayne and two sisters, Ruth Ellen and Nancy Louise, according to a report by Forbes magazine, with the latest chapter is set to unfold in 2015.

Glen Rollins, who spent years at Rollins Inc. and was COO until being fired, told Forbes the lawsuit is an attempt to escape a family 'cult' which wants to hire private investigators and conduct drugs tests on young younger generations before they are allowed their inheritance.

He said: 'We’d put up with a lot. We didn’t want to have our kids and grandkids go through that, or worse. We were unwilling to have them rule from the grave.' 

Together, the claimants allege that the elder generation has deprived them of their rightful inheritance via a web of trust funds with arcane and intrusive eligibility requirements.

All of the Rollins grandchildren - there are another five on Randall's side of the family - had trust funds started for them by Wayne Rollins, who died in 1991.

The Orkin pest control business was started in 1901 by Latvian immigrant Otto Orkin, but the Rollins family bought it out in 1967 and have controlled it via Rollins Inc. ever since.

In Wayne's lifetime the company grew hugely, and when he died it was worth billions with an organized plan for distributing the money to the next generation. 

But in 2000, Gary and Randall imposed new requirements on the funds, requiring their children to complete 'meaningful activity' such as work or education to qualify for annual payments in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

All the grandchildren accepted the regime - and many failed the tests over the years to come so missed out on millions of dollars. But the younger generation was outraged when in 2010 the two elder Rollins men tried to impose a new set of conditions on the payments.

This included a 'monitoring program' which allowed the men to hire private investigators, access medial records and make credit and drugs tests in order to ensure the children met the criteria.

Outraged, Gary's four children hired lawyers and have dragged the family through numerous court battles without resolving the dispute.

Randall's five children did not join in - but the litigant Rollins members allege their five cousins were paid off with $9million as a reward for not complaining.

The feud has split the family apart - Glen has divorced his wife, the two sets of cousins no longer speak and Gary Rollins, now 70, reportedly celebrated his recent remarriage with none of his children present.

Lawyers for Garry and Randall Rollins said: 'The plaintiffs’ lawsuits are motivated by greed and self-interest'. According to court papers, Randall's five children submitted supporting statements describing the litigant children as a 'disgruntled and diminishing minority of family members' who are violating their grandfather's intentions.

The children's suit has made its way through county and appeal courts in Georgia, and had a hearing at the Georgia Supreme Court in January of this year.

The next stage is reportedly due to take place in 2015.
