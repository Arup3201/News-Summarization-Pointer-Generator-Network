A teenager mowed down a woman in a hit-and-run over drug payments, leaving her with such severe head injuries she regressed to being a 12-year-old.

James Slater, 20, knocked over Amanda Richards as she rode a bike because he was embroiled in a dispute with her then-boyfriend over an outstanding cannabis payment, a court was told.

Miss Richards, 33, spent a week in a coma and - as a result of her 'catastrophic' injuries - has been unable to eat solid food after her jaw was broken in the collision.

'Catastrophic injuries': Amanda Richards, 33, spent a week in a coma and has been unable to eat solid food after her jaw was broken in the collision

She suffered four separate spinal injuries as well as post-traumatic amnesia for 12 weeks, which caused her to believe she was only 12 years old.

Her memory loss was so bad that she completely forgot that her brother had died years earlier.

Slater was jailed for nine years at Newcastle Crown Court after he pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm.

The court was told how Slater, then aged 18, had driven with his aunt and her two children to meet Miss Richard's then-partner, David Fiddler, over a dispute about drug payments.

Fiddler had supplied cannabis to Slater and had claimed the defendant still owed him money for it.

At around 7pm that night, Miss Richards along with her partner and her friend, were at a bus stop in Gateshead, when Slater, driving a small light blue car, approached them.

The court heard how he approached the trio, swerving as he did, with a clear intention to hit Mr Fiddler.

Mr Fiddler managed to get out the way, 
but Miss Richards was hit by the car and thrown over the bonnet, before 
landing face first on the ground.

Jailed: James Slater pleaded guilty to GBH

Slater, who failed stop after the accident, was arrested later that same evening.

He had been due to stand trial at Newcastle Crown Court but pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm before the case started.

Recorder Jonathan Sandiford said: 'What is clear to me is that once you were there you lost it.

'You drove that motor car towards him and you intended to use that car to cause him serious injury.

'You used a very dangerous weapon, that is what a motor car is. David Fiddler managed to get out of the way but Amanda Richards was not so fortunate.

'You didn't brake or swerve, you went right through her with that car and carried on driving and drove away.

'She suffered catastrophic injuries.'

Slater often bought cannabis from Mr Fiddler, but there had been a dispute when he claimed the teenager still owed him £180 for a purchase, the court heard.

Rupert Doswell, prosecuting, said: 'David Fiddler sent text messages to the defendant chasing him for the money.

'The defendant replied saying he didn't owe him any money, and there were some abusive messages by way of further response.

'Soon after, Mr Fiddler received a text message from another number claiming to be a police officer, saying to leave the defendant alone.'

The court heard that around 6pm, Mr Fiddler and Miss Richards left their home, and on the way met a friend who was riding on his BMX bike.

At this point Mr Fiddler received another text from Slater saying he was outside his house, but when he was informed they were no longer there said he would meet him in five minutes.

Slater then spotted in his car. He was driving erratically, swerving towards Mr Fiddler who had to jump out of the way.

But the vehicle then continued into the path of Miss Richards who was on the bike at this point.

Mr Doswell said: 'It was impossible for her to move in time. As a consequence the car collided with her.

'She was thrown over the car bonnet, her face hit the ground first.'

Those who witnessed the accident were 'amazed' at how high Miss Richards was thrown into the air.

Slater, of Gateshead, must now serve nine years in a young offenders institution, and he was disqualified from driving for five years.

His defence barrister, Jane Foley, said he was truly remorseful for causing the accident and was grateful she hadn't been killed.

She added: 'He is a young man who has never been to prison before. The car was used as a weapon, but I invite you to consider there was a lack of pre-meditation.

'It was impulsive and it was opportunistic at the time. If he could turn back the hands of time, he would like to do it very much.

'It is a very upsetting and traumatic case.'

'The worst thing was that I couldn't remember that my brother was dead, so I was angry that my family wouldn't bring him to see me'

Miss Richards has faced a slow recovery and it has taken months of hospital treatment for her to regain her memory. But even now she has permanent problems.

Speaking about her ordeal at the time Slater pleaded guilty, she said: 'The main thing is that I am still alive. Things could have been so different.

'I really believed I was 12 years old. I was demanding to see my best friend.

'I couldn't remember some of my family - I even thought my niece had stolen my face, because she looks so much like me.

'The worst thing was that I couldn't remember that my brother was dead, so I was angry that my family wouldn't bring him to see me.

'My mum had to tell me all over again that he had died years ago.'

Miss Richards has managed to return to work part-time as a cleaner, but struggles with her short-term memory, has developed epilepsy, and needs to go back into hospital for more surgery on her leg as well as extensive dental work.

Amanda credits new partner Tom Drummond, a lifelong family friend, for helping her make such impressive progress.

Tom, 31, along with her her family, has helped Miss Richards regain her confidence.

She added: 'I wouldn't be where I am today without Tom. He has pushed me to do things for myself, like getting the bus on my own.

'I feel very frustrated when I can't do things or remember things but things could be much worse, I could be in a wheelchair.

'I still don't feel I'm quite back to my normal self - all sorts of strange things have happened like my taste in food has changed.

'I don't have a social life any more, and I have to have someone with me almost 24/7 in case I have an epileptic fit.

'But I am looking forward to the rest of my life. I want to go to college to study IT.'
