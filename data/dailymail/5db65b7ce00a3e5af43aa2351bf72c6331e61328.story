Students who survived the Sandy Hook massacre will begin the long healing process by returning to classes after the winter break at a school in a neighboring town.

Chalk Hill School in Monroe, Connecticut
has been empty since June 2011. Volunteers and town officials have been
working to make it suitable for the traumatized children.

Twenty students, aged just six and seven, were killed by a gunman on Friday at the school in Newtown along with six teaching staff.

A spokesman for Monroe Superintendent of Schools James Agostine said the school will reopen some time after January 1 but a date hasn't been set.

Monroe police Lt. Brian McCauley says authorities are securing the school so that it is safe when Newtown officials send teachers and students there.

Officials said close to 100 per cent of the furniture, down to the teachers' desks, would be brought into Chalk Hill to create an exact replica of Sandy Hook. Chalk Hill had been due to be turned into a recreation center prior to the tragedy.

Some of the children returned to classes in Newtown on Tuesday but Sandy Hook elementary remains closed.

Eric Millgrem told the Today show that his daughter Lauren is simply too traumatized to return to school at the moment.

She hid in a bathroom with her classmates as children were gunned down in the room next door at Sandy Hook elementary. The little girl lost nine of her friends.

Her father said: 'She's just too afraid, she doesn't want to go to any school.'

Teachers also said that they would need 
time to heal before returning to the classroom as they struggled to come
to terms with the loss of colleagues and students that they loved dearly.

According to Patch, Chalk Hill School opened in 1969 as a middle school.

The long, heartbreaking line of funeral services continued today for the pupils who were killed along with six members of the teaching staff at Sandy Hook.

dreamed of joining their ranks.

She is believed to have hid the youngsters in her classroom closet before confronting the gunman telling
them the children were at the other end of the school.

It is unclear what will become of Sandy Hook elementary school. Some have argued the school should be torn down while others have suggested making the site into a memorial.

Newtown police Lt. George Sinko said he 'would find it very difficult' for students to return to the same school where they came so close to death.

But he added: 'We want to keep these kids together. They need to support each other.
