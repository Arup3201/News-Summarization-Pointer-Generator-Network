'Security risk': Alanna Panas, 24, was thrown out of a Maryland casino for breastfeeding her daughter

A 24-year-old mother has claimed she was kicked out of a casino for breastfeeding her seven-week-old daughter in the lobby.

Alanna Panas says she was thrown out by security at the Casino at Ocean Down in Berlin, Maryland, who told her she and daughter Lilly were a 'security risk'.

Ms Panas says she had intended to feed her daughter in her car but did not have time to get the keys and as it was a cold, rainy January evening, the casino lobby was her only choice.

Ms Panas, a mother-of-one from Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, had been staying with her family at their beach home in Ocean City for the weekend, and has just visited the casino with her boyfriend.

Her mother has been caring for Lilly while she was in the casino, but as the baby had gotten hungry, Ms Panas had left the casino floor to tend to her.

'It wasn't until my mom had left and I was standing in the lobby with Lilly that I realized I didn't have my car keys,' Panas told USA Today. 

The 24-year-old texted her boyfriend to leave the casino floor and come to the lobby with the keys, but as her baby was crying she began breast feeding in the lobby.

According to the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's website, 'a mother may breastfeed her child in any public or private location in which the mother and child are authorized to be.' 

She then claims she was approached by casino security and asked to leave the building because Lilly was under 21.  

'They told me that Lilly was a security threat.

'But I didn't have my baby on the casino floor. Lilly and I were in the corner of the lobby.'

Ms Panas explains further in a post on her Facebook page: 'I did what was best and began to breastfeed, the perfect nourishment for an infant. 

'It was then that I was approached and told to leave immediately. I kindly reminded the security guard that Lilly was 7 weeks old and it was freezing cold and raining, I was not willing to leave and risk her health. 

'I was still told I needed to leave with no where else to go but the cold and rain and was labelled as a situation.

The Casino at Ocean Down in Berlin, Maryland, claimed they had asked Ms Panas to leave as they saw her and seven-week-old Lilly as a threat of sneaking onto the casino floor

A frustrated Ms Panas posted her story on the casino's Facebook page after which it gained support from breastfeeding support groups and went viral. 

Casino at Ocean Downs has apologised on social media, saying that it 'strives to make our guests' experiences enjoyable, and if any member of our team acted in a manner that did not promote that experience, we apologize.'

However, Ms Panas says that the casino is not sincere in its apology. 

'[After the incident] I did receive a phone call from the Assistant Executive Director in which I was told I had been told to leave immediately because security saw Lilly and I as a threat of sneaking in.

'They denied it was due to breastfeeding. I was told they do permit children on the property and in the lobby since they do have family friendly events.

However, since I was a "threat" they reserve the right to expand the gaming floor boundaries to wherever they please. 

'I was never formally apologized to for how Lilly and I were treated.'
