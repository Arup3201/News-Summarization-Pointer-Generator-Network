For those frustrating times when a lone fly has buzzed around your head and you've almost lost your patience - just imagine this cluster zooming towards you.

We're used to talking about swarms of bees and armies of ants, but balls of flies have a less familiar ring to it.

That's because a cluster of this kind is a rare sight.

Louise Davis, a Water Resources Advisory Officer for Devon 
Wildlife Trust, came across the clump while she was conducting a survey of a river near Torrington.

Ball of flies: Hundreds of female flies cling to a branch as they prepare to lay their eggs. Their young will fall into the river and move on to their next life cycle

According to Devon Wildlife Trust, female Atherix ibis flies are known to cluster together as they prepare to lay their eggs.

The flies form clusters that hang from branches over rivers. The balls can be made up of hundreds of flies.

Ms Davis said: 'It was about the size of my 
fist, dangling from a branch. Then I saw several other similar shaped 
balls all hanging from the same tree.

Shock: Louise David said the cluster was the size of her fist and there were several separate balls hanging from the same tree

'At first I thought they were just
debris that had got stuck. On taking a closer look I discovered that 
each was a tightly-packed dome consisting of hundreds of flies.'

Once the females lay their eggs, the larvae will fall into the water below. They can be seen hanging from bridges or any elevated spot above water.

Miss Davis told Devon Wildlife Trust: 'I get to see a 
lot of wonderful wildlife at close quarters, but I’d never seen anything
like this. Nature really is full of surprises!’
