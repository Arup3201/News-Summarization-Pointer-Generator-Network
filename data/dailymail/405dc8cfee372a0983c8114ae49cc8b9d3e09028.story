Alleged attacker: Police are searching for 22-year-old Dexter Oliver, the woman's boyfriend, who is said to have thrown flammable liquid on her and set her alight after she took his clothes to a laundromat to wash them

A young mother is fighting for her life after she was doused in gasoline and set on fire following a row with her boyfriend over the washing.

The 25-year-old mother-of-three was taken to hospital with life threatening burns to her chest, face and neck.

Her alleged attacker, identified by San Francisco police as 22-year-old Dexter Oliver is still at large.

The woman was taken to the burn unit 
at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital with life-threatening injuries after 
the attack at a laundromat near her home.

Police were called to the city’s Bayview district after a woman was reported screaming in the street on Sunday around 12.15pm.

Officers
arrived on scene to find the woman with her clothes on fire, which she 
was able to remove on her own, Officer Carlos Manfredi of the San 
Francisco Police said.

Police
confirmed that Mr Oliver had a ‘dating relationship’ with the victim 
but could not expand on the circumstances that led to the attack.

Mr Oliver used gasoline from a tank in the woman’s own home following an argument, her sister Precious Craig told KTVU.com.

Ms
Craig, who lives with the victim and their mother, said the her sister 
and Mr Oliver had a volatile relationship but that she never expected 
the horrific attack.

‘They argue and stuff all the time, but I didn't think it was going to go this far,’ she told KTVU.

'My sister wanted to leave her clothes
at the laundromat, but he didn't want to leave them there. He got mad 
and threw the clothes down.

'Ten minutes later, she was burned.'

Airing their dirty laundry: The pair is said to have argued over the 25-year-old's decision to take Mr Oliver's clothes to the laundromat, after which he followed her there and set her on fire.

He is described as a 5ft 10in and 155lbs with his hair shaved in the shape of a
fish on one side of his head and a lightning bolt on the other.
