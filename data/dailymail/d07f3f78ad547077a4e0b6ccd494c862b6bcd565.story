Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden is pregnant with her second child.

The TV presenter/actress, 39, announced she is expecting a baby boy in March with husband Chris Hughes, 37.

But Holden also explained she waited so long to announce her pregnancy after she tragically suffered a miscarriage last year.

The couple, who married in December 2008, are already parents to daughter Alexa, aka Lexi, who turns five later this month.

Writing on her Twitter page yesterday, she said: 'Just to let you know. I am 6 months pregnant with a baby boy!! Have had to keep it quiet until now!'

A statement from her publicist said the couple are 'absolutely thrilled'.

Her publicist Alison Griffin added: 'They say they cannot wait to welcome the new addition to their family.'

In a statement on her official website, Holden revealed her secret heartbreak last year after losing her unborn child.

It read: 'Amanda Holden and her husband Chris Hughes are delighted to announce that Amanda is 6 months pregnant with their second child.

'Their delight is increased by the fact that last year she tragically lost a baby.

'As they are sure everyone will understand they needed to get the all clear from the doctor before they shared their very happy news.'

Sending his congratulations on Twitter was her former Britain's Got 
Talent co-judge Piers Morgan: 'OK - Amanda Holden's pregnant...

'She's
 6 months pregnant too - how the hell did someone so indiscreet keep 
that a secret so long? Very excited for her and Chris.'

Holly Willoughby - who is also pregnant with her second child - Tweeted: 'Congrats my darling! A boy! How wonderful, bet Lexi can't wait... Big kiss to family Holden.'

Denise Van Outen also wrote: 'Huge congrats you to and your family. Exciting news! Love the Meads.'

Myleene Klass - another pregnant TV presenter - added: 'HUGE congrats gorgeous girl. Very happy for you, Chris and Lexi. More pool play dates with our babies!'

Her 
pregnancy comes in a busy year for Holden - she starts judging the new 
series of Britain's Got Talent this month and is set to play Princess 
Fiona in the new West End production of Shrek: The Musical, when it 
opens in the Spring.

Big announcement: Holden revealed she was expecting a boy on her Twitter page

But Holden insisted yesterday on Twitter her pregnancy wouldn't affect 
either commitment: 'I'm still doing BGT and Shrek the musical.'

In an interview last year, Holden admitted she had started getting broody.

She said: 'I'd love to have more children.

'I'm 39 so I'd be very lucky, I've got lots of friends who have waited too long.

'If it happens it happens. But I'm blessed with one.'

The former Cutting It actress married music executive Hughes at Babington House in Somerset in December 2008 after a five year courtship.

The couple announced their engagement in December 2004, but delayed their wedding after Holden fell pregnant with Alexa, who was born in January 2006.

Previously, Holden was married to comedian Les Dennis - 18 years her senior.

The couple split in 2002 - three years after Amanda's brief affair with Men Behaving Badly star Neil Morrissey was exposed in the press.
