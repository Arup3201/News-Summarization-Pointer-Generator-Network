A copycat crook who attempted to blackmail billionaire F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone to fund his own wedding is facing jail.

Denture technician Martin Peckham, 41, demanded up to £200,000 from the racing supremo claiming kidnappers were poised to abduct his socialite daughter Tamara.

The father-of-two threatened Mr Ecclestone in a series of phone calls to his business office between June 20 and July 4 this year.

A court heard Peckham, who hoped to use the cash to pay for his impending wedding and to buy a house, got the idea after reading about a similar plot to extort the wealthy family.

Peckham’s ‘amateurish’ plot was inspired by the case of Derek Rose, 32 and Jakir Uddin, 19, who last month denied attempting to blackmail Miss Ecclestone for £200,000 by threatening to reveal details of her sex life.

The technician, who runs a family business with his father and brother, appeared in the dock at Southwark Crown Court today where he pleaded guilty to a single count of blackmail.

Dressed in a black shirt and black trousers Peckham spoke only to confirm his name and enter his plea.

Judge Alistair McCreath granted him bail but warned he faced a ‘significant and substantial’ jail term when he is sentenced on September 3.

The judge said: ‘There can be no doubt about it that an offence of this kind inevitably leads to a significant and substantial prison sentence.

‘But, I’m prepared to adjourn sentence for a report, not to help the court with what the outcome should be but as to how long the sentence should be.

‘I give you no false hope, you understand what the inevitable outcome of this offending must be.’

Last week prosecutor Peter Zinner told the same court: ‘The Crown’s case is that Mr Peckham became aware of another separate case, and he is said to have tried to exploit that situation for his own gain but it is not linked in any way.’

Rose and Uddin are to stand trial on February 18 next year, where Miss Ecclestone is expected to a witness.

At an earlier hearing prosecutor Philip Lemoine said: ‘This was a crudely-executed, perhaps not frivolous but rather amateurish, attempt to obtain money from Mr Ecclestone.

‘Amateurish it might have been, but it was a targeted offence. The family is vulnerable and Mr Ecclestone took it seriously.’

Peckham, from Colchester, Essex, pleaded guilty to one count of blackmail.

He was bailed on the condition he live and sleep at his home address and observe an 8pm to 7am curfew monitored by an electronic ankle tag.

He must also surrender his passport to police and is banned from contacting Bernie Ecclestone, his business office, Tamara Ecclestone, and her boyfriend Amre Al Khyami.
