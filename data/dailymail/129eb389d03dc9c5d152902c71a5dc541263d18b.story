As many as ten children were killed when a Syrian jet bombed their village, it was claimed yesterday.

Activists said the youngsters were playing outside when the aircraft struck Deir al-Asafir - close to the capital Damascus - with cluster bombs.

The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said eight died while the Revolution Command Council said the figure was ten.

Deadly: Cluster bombs thought to be used by Syrian security forces on the  town of Deir Essafir which killed at least 8 children

Deadly: A Syrian boy picks up parts of explosive devices that landed on his frontyard in the village of Atme, near the Turkish border in Syria's Idlib province

An amateur video showed two girls lying 
dead in a street while the bodies of two bloodied dead boys were in the 
back seat of a car parked nearby.

Several other wounded children were seen rushed for treatment.

Another video showed the bodies of 
two dead boys inside what appeared to be a makeshift hospital as others 
received treatment from injuries while lying on the floor.

The activist videos appeared genuine 
and corresponded to other reporting about the events depicted. Syria 
restricts the access of journalists.

Syria's conflict erupted in March 2011 with an uprising against Assad's regime, inspired by other Arab Spring revolts.

It quickly morphed into a civil war that has since killed more than 40,000 people, according to activists.

Fighting: Free Syrian Army fighters are seen in Daria near Damascus. The director of the observatory, Rami Abdul-Rahman, said rebels seized control of the Marj al-Sultan base on the outskirts of Damascus yesterday morning

Destruction: Residents walk near debris from damaged buildings after shelling by forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad at Daria near Damascus

Hundreds of children have been killed since the crisis began, according to activists.

The
 air base takeover claim showed how rebels are advancing in the area of 
the capital, though they are badly outgunned, making inroads where 
Assad's power was once unchallenged.

Rebels have also been able to fire mortar rounds into Damascus recently.

The
 director of the observatory, Rami Abdul-Rahman, said rebels seized 
control of the Marj al-Sultan base on the outskirts of Damascus 
yesterday morning.

He said at least 15 rebels and eight 
soldiers were killed in the fighting that started a day earlier. The 
rebels later withdrew from the base.

Rebels
 appear to be trying to take over air bases and destroy aircraft in 
order to prevent the regime from using them in attacks against 
opposition forces around the country.

The rebels have no protection against the attack helicopters and fighter jets that have been blasting their positions.

Rebels have been attacking air bases in different parts of Syria, mostly in the northern regions of Idlib and Aleppo.

In the battle at the base outside 
Damascus, Mr Abdul-Rahman and Damascus-based activist Maath al-Shami 
said rebels destroyed two helicopters with rocket propelled grenades and
 captured a tank.

They say the base, which is on the eastern outskirts of Damascus, houses several radar positions.

'This
 is a blow to the morale of the regime, because it is close to the heart
 of the capital,' said Mr Abdul-Rahman, referring to the base that is 
about 10 miles from Damascus.

Mr
 Al-Shami said the rebels withdrew from the base after they captured 
some ammunition. He said they feared counter-strikes by regime aircraft.

Damaged: A Syrian warplane launched three bombs or rockets at a rebel command centre in the northwest of the country near the Turkish border without causing casualties

An
 amateur video posted online showed rebels walking next to two destroyed
 helicopters. At least three other helicopters appeared undamaged. Black
 smoke billowed in the distance.

Another
 video showed several radar posts on hills inside the large compound. 
Parked military trucks stood inside as rebels roamed freely.

The
 observatory also reported violence in other parts of Syria, including 
the country's largest city of Aleppo in the north and the capital 
itself.

It said rebels captured a training 
base for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General 
Command near the Damascus suburb of Douma yesterday. The PFLP-GC is one 
of the Palestinian factions most loyal to Assad.

The
 PFLP-GC said on Saturday that the base was under attack. It said 
thousands of activists and fighters who fought against Israel were 
trained at the base over the past 30 years.

Meanwhile
 the observatory said a bomb targeted a bus in the southern village of 
Othman yesterday, killing at least five people and wounding dozens.

t 
said rebels and troops clashed in the southern region of Quneitra on the
 edge of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

The
 Local Co-ordination Committees, another activist group, said residents 
found 12 bodies in the Damascus suburb of Daraya, the scene of heavy 
clashes between rebels and government troops over the past few days.

State TV said troops clashed with al Qaida militants in Daraya, killing some of them and confiscating a mortar that they were using in their attacks.

The station said troops killed an al Qaida affiliated Palestinian militant known as Abu Suhaib in the Damascus suburb of Hajira. It said his group was behind several bombings in Syria that killed and wounded dozens of people.

Assad's regime blames the revolt on a foreign conspiracy.

It accuses Saudi Arabia and Qatar, along with the United States, other Western countries and Turkey, of funding, training and arming the rebels, whom it calls terrorists.
