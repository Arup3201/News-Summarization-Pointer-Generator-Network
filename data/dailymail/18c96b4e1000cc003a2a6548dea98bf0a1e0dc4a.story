As heir to the throne, he’s certainly not short of a bob or two to spend on a new coat.

But it seems Prince Charles would rather make do and mend when it comes to his trusted old gardening jacket, which he was seen wearing on last night’s special edition of Countryfile on BBC1.

He had attempted to disguise the holes and tears in his worn-out coat by patching them up with an array of green and brown materials.

The Prince said: ‘I got somebody to patch it up with leather and now I can hardly move.’

Prince Charles also showed off his expertise in the traditional craft of hedge-laying on his Highgrove Estate.

He enthused about his passion for the art, in which the plant stems are cut and bent over to form a thick hedgerow.

He said: ‘I love it. It’s terrific 
exercise and at the same time it’s a sort of hobby or interest to see if
you can get better at doing it.

‘When you first lay a hedge, if you 
do it well, it looks so marvellous and then the fun is to see three or 
four years later, it looks like a hedge that’s always been there.’

The prince had agreed to guest-edit the weekly rural affairs programme as part of its 25th anniversary celebrations.

During the show he also talked about 
the importance of protecting the world for future generations, 
‘particularly grandchildren.’

Asked whether the prospect of 
becoming a grandfather made him feel old, he replied: ‘Of course it does
to a certain degree because you can’t believe that suddenly that is 
beginning to happen in your life.

‘It’s a lovely thought and I’ve looked forward enormously to – that relationship with a grandchild.’
