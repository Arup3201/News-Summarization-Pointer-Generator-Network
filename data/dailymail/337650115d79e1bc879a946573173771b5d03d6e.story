The moment police gunned down a schizophrenic woman in a hail of bullets has been caught on shocking video.

Police in Long Beach, California, say they had no choice but to open fire when Adeline Arroyo, 31, pointed BB gun at them Sunday afternoon. The weapon looked like nearly an exact replica of a Beretta semi-automatic pistol.

Despite police firing numerous shots at her and hitting her twice, Miss Arroyo is expected to survive. She is currently recovering at a local hospital in serious condition.

Her family says she has a long history of mental illness and suffers from schizophrenia. They say police never should have shot her and instead found a less violent way to subdue her.

The moment: Adeline Arroyo, 31, can be seen walking toward officers with what appears to be a pistol. This shot was taken a split-second before officers opened fire

Shot: Miss Arroyo immediately recoils and falls to the ground as she is shot. Her family says she was hit twice, but police can be heard firing at least ten times

Sick: Miss Arroyo's family says the 31-year-old is schizophrenic and has a long history of mental illness

KCAL-TV cameras were rolling when Arroyo was gunned down in broad daylight in the middle of a popular street in Long Beach.

Officers can be heard shouting at her over loudspeakers as she stumbles around the sidewalk in pajamas.

At first she seems to conceal the pistol under a coat. Then she can be seen clearly holding what looks like a weapon in her hand.

A video provided to KABC-TV from a witness shows a dozen officers barricaded behind their squad cars, pointing guns at her from all sides.

Some have handguns, others are armed with rifles and shotguns. 

Realistic: This is the BB gun that Miss Arroyo was holding when she was shot. It looks nearly identical to a Beretta semi-automatic pistol

Miss Arroyo, right behind a car, was surrounded by officers on three sides. It is unknown how many of them opened fire on her

The camera captures the moment that police open fire, as she lunches toward the officers.

Ten to 11 shots can be heard - including after she falls to the ground. It's unknown how many officers opened fire and exactly how many shots were fired. 

Miss Arroyo's family says she was hit twice. She was rushed to the hospital in critical condition and later upgraded to serious condition. 

'I'm feeling distraught about the whole thing. This is something that shouldn't have happened,' Irene Ward, Miss Arroyo's aunt, told KABC.

Police say they had no choice but to shoot Miss Arroyo because she refused to drop the pistol

'I feel the Long Beach Police Department should be more trained when they're dealing with somebody with a mental illness.'

But, the Long Beach police chief said his officers had no choice but to open fire when Miss Arroyo repeatedly refused to drop the pistol.

'If a person has a handgun and they point that in your direction, then at that point less lethal is not appropriate. You're facing a lethal threat,' Chief Jim McDonnell said.

This is the 19th person shot by officers in the city of 460,000 so far this year.
