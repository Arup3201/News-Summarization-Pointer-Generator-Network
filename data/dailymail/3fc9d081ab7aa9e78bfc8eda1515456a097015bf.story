From monkeys swinging in a tree to flying through the air clutching balloons and fishing on a lake, these adorable pictures reveal how these children unleashed their imaginations to create a series of make-believe scenes.

The youngsters aged 3-11 had a great time pretending to sit on a school bus, hold a birthday party and eat fruit in a classroom in the arty shots.

Photographer 'Admiral' Jan von Holleben, 37, from Germany, came up with the idea for the project and said he hoped the results proved that 'everything is possible'.

He and the youngsters spent up to an hour arranging the props for each sketch on the floor.

It took around 25 photoshoots over 10 months to complete the series.

Jan, from Berlin, said: 'I was keen to get the children involved with the making of these photos and worked with them in a big team in a never-ending playground.

'Each shot took from a matter of minutes to an hour to set up, depending on its complexity and the art direction needed.

'We put our heads together to share our creative ideas about adventures, everyday fun, things we want to show off with and anything that tells a really good story.

'We only used everyday objects to create the magic - things from my garage, the cellar, around the house and anything else we could find nearby.

'The amount of images we set up was very hard and exhausting. It really pushed me to my limits - physically as well as mentally, but each individual image was very easy and fun to do.

'I sketched out most images on paper or had a solid idea formed in my head. Sometimes it took one to two minutes to bring them to life and even the most difficult only five to 10 minutes maximum to get the final shot.

'Overall the project was very quick and fun to do - but things got hectic as soon as the kids lay in the picture. I love the photos because they prove that everything is possible and nothing is impossible.'

von Hollebon has held workshops with children on photographing dreams and is working on a children's book packed with these photos.

von Holleben was born in 1977 and grew up in the southern German countryside. He lived most of his youth in an alternative commune and says his photographic style was influenced by his parents, a cinematographer and child therapist.

At age 13 he followed his father's career by picking up a camera. After experimenting with all sorts of 'magical tricks' and developing his signature style with the help of friends and family, von Holleben honed his technique in commercial settings.

The photographer studied and worked in London for several years before moving to Berlin.
