Lieutenant William Malcolm Chisholm just before sailing to France in August 1914

The first Australian to die in World War I has been officially recognised by the Australian War Memorial almost 100 years after he died.

Lieutenant William Malcolm Chisholm was 22 years old when he was wounded in the Battle of Le Cateau on 26 August 1914, just three days after arriving in France. He died the next day.

Records previously showed Captain Brian Pockley and Able Seaman William Williams, both killed in September 1914, were the first Australians to have died in the Great War.

Today the Australian War Memorial added Chisholm - who served in a British regiment - to its Commemorative Roll.

But Chisholm's family say they have always known their relative died first, as have British and French historians and the authors of at least five books.

Chisholm's great niece Airlie Moore said she had tried to inform the War Memorial about Chisholm in 2006.

She added that she was contacted about adding Chisholm to the War Memorial's Commemorative Roll in April this year after an article about him appeared in a French newspaper.

'I said that I'd been to the War Memorial and I tried to talk to people and they weren't interested and they said it was because he was serving in a foreign regiment,' she said.

'I don't think we talk about a British regiment as a "foreign regiment" I think we talk about it as an "ally".'

Chisholm was born in Sydney in 1892, the eldest son of an eminent surgeon.

He grew up on Macquarie St in Sydney and attended Sydney Grammar School where he was a prefect.

He was commissioned in the New South Wales Scottish Rifles before his family moved to England in 1910. 

Chisholm was accepted into the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in 1911. Two years later he was gazetted into the 1st Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment, and embarked for France in August 1914.

'He died in the Battle of Le Cateau which was part of the Battle of Mons which was the first major battle the British were involved with in France,' Mrs Moore told Daily Mail Australia.

'They were in retreat he was hit with shrapnel in the stomach.'

Mrs Moore said his possessions were sent by the Red Cross back to her great grandparents.

'His sword was hanging on the wall of my father's office,' she said.

'We have his watch which was on him when he was killed.'

Mrs Moore said she has known her relative was the first Australian to die in World War I since she was a child.

'We just knew. We didn't talk about it all the time, why would you, but we knew.'

Mrs Moore said she believed the War Memorial was in a 'scramble' to recognise Chisholm before the memorial service to mark 100 years since his death.

The service will be held on August 26th at St Stephen's Uniting Church on Macquarie St in Sydney – Chisholm's family church and the place where his original memorial service was held.

'It's a scramble because the French put an article in the paper,' she said.

Mrs Moore said she is not angry it has taken almost a century for Chisholm to be added to the Commemorative Roll.

'I'm just slightly bemused,' she said.

'I think their credibility as a history source has suffered in my mind.

'I'll always look at their version of history and wonder how accurate it is, knowing they couldn't get this bit right.'

A spokeswoman for the War Memorial said its Roll of Honour (the bronze panels in the cloisters of the Memorial's commemorative area) lists the names of 106,000 Australian servicemen and women who fought and died on active service as members of the Australian forces.

The Battle of Le Cateau was fought on 26 August 1914, after the British and French retreated from the Battle of Mons and had set up defensive positions in a fighting withdrawal against the German advance at Le Cateau-Cambrésis

'Since Lieutenant Chisholm died while serving in a British regiment, he does not fit the criteria for the Roll of Honour,' she said.

'He does, however, meet the criteria for the Commemorative Roll, which honours Australians known to have fought and died in allied forces.

'Since we don't hold British service records here at the Memorial, we have to rely on the descendants of men like Lieut Chisholm to approach the Memorial with sufficient archival evidence and make an application for inclusion.

'The family of Malcolm Chisholm has never approached the Memorial with an application.'

The spokeswoman added that a member of the public from Sydney started the ball rolling after a news report in March this year.
