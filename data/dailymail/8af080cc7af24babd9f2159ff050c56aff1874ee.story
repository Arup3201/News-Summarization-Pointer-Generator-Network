Nowhere to go: Spaniard Rodrigo Ben-Azul has become a familiar sight at Santiago Airport, in the capital of Chile, ever since he ran out of money

A tourist has been stranded in an airport for more than two months in a real-life tale that has echoes of Tom Hanks' smash-hit movie The Terminal.

Spaniard Rodrigo Ben-Azul has become a familiar sight at Santiago Airport, in the capital of Chile, ever since he ran out of money.

He told newspaper PubliMetro that he arrived in the South American country in November to 'resolve a dispute' with family members that lived there.

But, after failing to work out the 
issue, he returned to the terminal and has spent the last eight weeks - 
including over Christmas and New Year - waiting for relatives in Spain 
to send him money for his return flight.

He told Chilean TV station Megavision: 'I am trying to return to Spain.

'I'm waiting for them to send me money for the ticket'.

Airport
 workers have said he has a daily routine, involving pushing abandoned 
luggage trolleys back into their spaces so he can claim the money.

At night he finds a 'small corner' 
where he sleeps.

During the day he spends his time looking for food 
in dustbins and cigarette ends which can still be smoked.

Little
 else is known about the man, who is often seen wandering the 
concourses, luggage in tow and headphones firmly placed in his ears.

His
 story has echoes of the 2004 comedy movie, also starring Catherine 
Zeta-Jones, where Hanks' character Viktor Navorski is trapped in a 
terminal at New York's John F Kennedy Airport.

Keeping busy: Airport workers have said he has a daily routine, involving pushing abandoned luggage trolleys back into their spaces so he can claim the money

Awaiting help: He told newspaper PubliMetro that he arrived in the South American country in November to 'resolve a dispute' with family members that lived there

Rest: After each day comes to an end, he finds a 'small corner' in the airport to get comfortable and have a sleep

Denied entry into the U.S., he cannot return to his fictitious country of Krakozhia due to a revolution, and so he stays in the terminal for nine months until the conflict is over.

During his stay, he falls in love with pretty air hostess called Amelia, played by Zeta-Jones, who helps him realise his dream of obtaining the autograph of his hero, the tenor saxophonist Benny Golson.

The film was in part inspired by the story of Iranian refugee Mehran Karimi Nasseri who spent 17 years living in the Charles de Gaulle International Airport's Terminal I in Paris, France, from 1988 to 2006.

Nasseri had his luggage at his side constantly throughout his stay, and spent his time reading, writing in his diary, or studying economics.

He received food and newspapers from employees of the airport before he was finally forced to leave due to a mystery illness.

He wrote a memoir of his time in Charles de Gaulle, called The Terminal Man, which helped form the backbone to Hanks' movie.
