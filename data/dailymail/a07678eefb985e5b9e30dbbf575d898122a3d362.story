POWERS OF TWO: THE ESSENCE OF INNOVATION IN CREATIVE PAIRS by Joshua Wolf Shenk (John Murray £20) 

Joshua Wolf Shenk has hit upon the interesting notion that creativity cannot occur in a vacuum. Even a proud, solitary genius such as Picasso was motivated and impelled by his rivalry with Braque and Matisse.

William Wordsworth’s poems utilised ‘imagery and ideas’ from his sister Dorothy’s journals, and behind Vincent Van Gogh was his brother, Theo, his business manager and dealer. ‘They lost patience with each other. They made each other furious. But they also spurred and served each other.’

Theo, in his polished boots and pressed suit, has been eclipsed in history by the bohemian Vincent, a mess in his patched trousers — but, without the former man’s diligence, we’d not have had the other’s electric achievement.

Eric Morecambe would have been a great actor if given the chance and was once offered a straight role. He was about to accept when Ernie Wise intervened and wouldn’t let him

Thus, in this fascinating study of ‘the intricate, intense interdependency between people’, the conclusion seems to be that ‘when we go back and forth, our ideas, our ambitions, our efficiency, our ability — everything gets bigger’.

The more we overlap and collaborate, the larger we become, ‘much larger than we were as two individuals’. This can be true of authors, such as Scott Fitzgerald and Jeffrey Archer, who depend often on unacknowledged editors to shape ‘unwieldy manuscripts’.

Politicians have speech-writers and aides behind the scenes, whether lowly MPs, or Gandhi and Martin Luther King. (Mrs Thatcher once said of Viscount Whitelaw: ‘Every prime minister needs a Willie’).

Even famous politicians like Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King relied on their speech writers

Pop performers, in particular, are heavily dependent on producers, promoters and studio engineers. It is with famous double acts, however, that ‘an unmistakeable psychological union’ takes place, which goes down ‘to the bedrock of cognition’.

Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, when formulating psychoanalysis, exchanged 337 letters, in which their handwriting and linguistic style merged. They could literally ‘finish each other’s sentences’, says Shenk.

Bill Gates, of Microsoft, calls this the blissful state of being able to get on to a ‘high bandwidth’ with a soulmate: ‘wordless communication that observers commonly describe as telepathic’.

C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien achieved this symbiosis. Meeting in a group called The Inklings to drink beer and discuss elves, they shared a love affair with Anglo-Saxon literature and Viking sagas.

Out of this, Narnia and Hobbits were generated. When reading out pages of their manuscripts, ‘praise for good work was unstinted, but censure for bad work was often brutally frank’.

Though based in a Paris, rather than an Oxford, inn, Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre were similar, ‘working in the same cafe at separate tables’.

With James Watson and Francis Crick, who together discovered the structure of DNA at Cambridge’s Cavendish Laboratory, the creative enterprise was seen to be selfless. These two filled gaps in each other’s knowledge and, ‘when one of us got on the wrong track, the other one got out of it’.

They only fell out away from the lab, when Watson published an autobiography that Crick thought ‘a violation of friendship that grossly invaded my privacy’.

The story is not as straight- forward as Shenk presents it. Crick and Watson were heavily reliant upon the research and innovations of Rosalind Franklin, who didn’t share the Nobel Prize with them only because she was a woman — a shameful episode.

Lennon and McCartney had a voluble, prickly partnership from the start. Shenk writes brilliantly of the psychology behind The Beatles. Paul was meticulous and organised, John ‘seemed to live in chaos’.

‘He was constantly searching for scraps of paper he’d hurriedly scribbled ideas on . . . Paul was the diplomat, John the agitator’. They were so creatively and claustrophobically entangled, a split was inevitable — Yoko was John’s escape route.

As Cynthia Lennon summed up: ‘John needed Paul’s attention to detail and persistence, Paul needed John’s anarchic, lateral thinking.’

The dependence, the proximity, can lead to resentment. Ballerina Suzanne Farrell became the muse of choreographer George Balanchine.

They had a ‘silent understanding’, leading to great work on the New York stage. But ‘four times had Balanchine married his lead ballerinas’. he’d be inspired, drain them, move on — a real-life version of the vampire theme in The Red Shoes.

To be a distinct pair yet only recognised as a unity can fester into hatred — as with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. Their comical slapstick fights became real, and they went from ‘rambunctious friends to wary enemies’, not speaking for years.

Authors such as Jeffrey Archer depend often on editors to shape ‘unwieldy manuscripts’

Frank Sinatra reintroduced them, but it was as painful and awkward as former spouses meeting again decades hence.

What Shenk calls ‘the essential dynamics between pairs’ is like an intense marriage, even if the partners are brothers. Orville and Wilbur Wright did nothing but squabble, but enjoyed the animosity. ‘I love to scrap with Orv. Orv is a good scrapper,’ said Wilbur.

Vincent Van Gogh, however, couldn’t cope with the idea of Theo having any sort of existence beyond just the pair of them. It was when Theo announced his engagement that Vincent chopped his ear off.

When Dudley Moore chose to move to Hollywood and break up his double act with Peter Cook, Cook told Mavis Nicholson it was ‘a divorce’, pure and simple.

It had been a marriage of two minds; together and separate, side by side and neck and neck, the comedians had undertaken ‘parallel missions that intertwined’, the one man mutually reinforcing the invention of the other. Without such a structure, Cook drank himself to death.

Shenk doesn’t, in fact, feature Cook and Moore, but a British version of his book ought to be commissioned, which could investigate the partnerships of Rolls and Royce, Marks and Spencer, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, Saatchi and Saatchi, the Two Ronnies, Welsh duo Ryan and Ronnie, Galton and Simpson, and Morecambe and Wise.

Eric, for example, a great actor if given the chance, was once offered a straight role. He was about to accept when Ernie intervened and wouldn’t let him. I hate Little Ern for having the power to do that.
