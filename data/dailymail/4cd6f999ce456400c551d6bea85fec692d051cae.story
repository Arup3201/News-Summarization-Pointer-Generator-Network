An ostrich caused traffic chaos in this country lane after racing alongside cars at speeds of more than 40mph.

The escaped bird was seen dashing past more than 20 cars on the main road between the villages of Rusthall and Speldhurst in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, yesterday.

Adult ostriches can run up to 60mph and grow to more than 9ft-tall, and while this youngster is just over 2ft-tall, it was still able to run at more than 40mph, according to locals.

Motorists slammed on the brakes after spotting the flightless bird running up and down the busy main road - causing queues of more than 20 minutes between 8.30am and 9am.

Jokers have now set up a Twitter account for the bird called TWellsOstrich.

Posts include: 'Time to hit the road! Watch out for me this morning' and 'I'm very tired from running around Tunbridge Wells all day!'

Other posts include 'There I was confidently gambolling down the road and everyone started staring at me. I don't know why', and 'I am a free range Ostrich I have you know'.

Local resident Colin Grant, 45, said: 'It was dashing around pretty fast - when I first saw it it overtook me and I was doing about 30mph, so it must have been going at 40mph plus.

'It was a very curious sight - it must have escaped from an ostrich farm nearby.'

The Tunbridge Wells Ostrich has even gained a following on Twitter

One motorist caught in the queue said: 'There was a queue of about 20 cars pulled over and I assumed it was a lorry coming down.

'I noticed a couple of people getting out of their cars and others leaning out of their windows and taking pictures.'

He added: 'Then I saw this young perky ostrich confidently gambolling down the road, with its funny gait.

'It came right up to our window and looked at us but I only managed to get the first shot on my phone.'

The police and local council were alerted to the incident.

It is not the first time an exotic animal has been seen on the loose in Britain.

In October and November last year wild wallabies were caught in Highgate Cemetery.

The first was caught in October by the RSPCA while a second was found two weeks later.

It is believed that someone dumped both marsupials in Highgate Woods and that they made their way to the famous cemetery.

The ostrich is a large flightless bird native to Africa which can ran at speeds of up to 60mph.

The largest living species of bird, they can weigh between 10 and 20 stone and also lay the largest eggs of any living bird.

They also have a long lifespan for birds - in captivity, ostriches have lived as long as 62 years and seven months.

On the African savanna however they may face a number of predators including lions, leopards and hyenas.

But their extraordinary running power means they are often able to outrun most predators, other than the cheetah.
