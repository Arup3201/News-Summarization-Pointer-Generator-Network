A Jaguar advert featuring Hollywood actor Tom Hiddleston has been banned for promoting speeding and unsafe driving.

The video was published on Jaguar Land Rover’s YouTube channel and was titled The Art Of Villainy.

It showed the actor - perhaps best known for his role of Loki in several Marvel Studios films - playing a villain while driving a Jaguar F-Type in an underground car park and through central London.

A Jaguar advert that featured Hollywood star Tom Hiddleston, pictured, has been banned by a watchdog for promoting speeding and unsafe driving

The advert - which was called The Art of Villainy - showed the actor driving an F-Type Jaguar in an underground car park and through the streets of central London 

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received a complaint that the advert was socially irresponsible because it featured and encouraged unsafe driving.

An investigation was launched and, despite the car maker claiming the car barely moved in the advert, it was banned by the watchdog.

Last month the ASA banned a set of 
four video adverts on Jaguar’s website showing a car travelling at speed 
through a tunnel and crossing over the single white lines in the middle 
of a road, before driving across a mountain road at night.

It said the overall impression of the adverts was a focus on the speed and
 acceleration of the cars.

It added that the cars were being driven on 
what appeared to be public roads and in a manner that would be 
'irresponsible and illegal' in the UK.

On hearing about the latest complaint, Jaguar Land Rover said the advert was 
set almost entirely in an underground car park and that during this time
 the car barely moved.

The 
car maker added when the car leaves the car park towards the end of the 
footage, it was shown to be travelling at normal road speeds.

The company claimed that, although the vehicle accelerated briefly along The Embankment, the speed limit was not exceeded.

In its ruling, the ASA said that - although the car's appearance was the main focus of the film - acceleration and speed did feature in the footage.

It said: 'Whilst we acknowledge the sequences were brief, we considered that the second part of the ad suggested that the car was being driven at excessive speeds and that the ad therefore encouraged irresponsible driving.'

It ruled that the advert must not appear again in its current form, adding: 'We told Jaguar Land Rover not to portray speed or driving behaviour that might encourage motorists to drive irresponsibly in future.' 

Last month a series of four Jaguar adverts were banned - including this one showing who cars travelling down a dust road - for promoting unsafe driving
