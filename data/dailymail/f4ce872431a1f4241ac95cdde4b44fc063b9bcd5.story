Manchester City couldn't have started their Champions League campaign with a tougher test but their players appeared relaxed as they left England on Tuesday.

Germany is the destination for Manuel Pellegrini's side as they face Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich.

And Sergio Aguero, Fernandinho and Bacary Sagna were all smiles as they prepared to make the trip.

Gael Clichy and Joe Hart were also pictured messing around in Manchester Airport as the relaxed atmosphere continued. 

City have history with Bayern, who were also in their group last year. They were beaten at home but escaped from the Allianz Arena with a win and will be hoping for a similar outcome in Munich this time.

Drawn in the 'group of death' along with Roma and CSKA Moscow, James Milner still believes City have the quality to win the competition.

He said: ‘Yes, I think that a club like we are, and the players we have, that is the ultimate aim. When I first signed at the club, the Champions League was new to the club.

'It was new to us a team . . . I think having won the Premier League a couple of times, and been fortunate enough to win every trophy domestically, we now want to prove ourselves on the European stage.

‘I believe we have a good enough team to do that.’
