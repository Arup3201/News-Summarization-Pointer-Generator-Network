As a 19-year-old woman was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the 
brutal murder of a teenager, who was lured by text message to a fatal ambush, his mother confronted her in court telling her she could have saved her son's life.

Seath Tyler Jackson, 15, from Florida, was beaten, shot and burned and his body parts disposed of in paint cans in April by a gang of five, simply because one of the boys had a grudge against him over a girl.

One of the gang, Charlie Kay Ely, was found guilty in 
September of first-degree murder and sentenced yesterday as Seath's mother told her: 'I have no sympathy for the tears you shed.'

Sonia Jackson addressed the court - and Ely - yesterday, telling her without ever looking in her direction: 'Some
say your life is over. (But) You will still see and talk to your 
family. You will still get letters and birthday cards. You will still 
laugh and cry.

'I
have no sympathy for the tears you shed. They have not been for Seath, 
but rather for what's happened to you. You could have been a
hero and saved many lives.'

The hearing took less than ten minutes, according to the Gainsville Sun. Outside the courtroom, Ely’s family was devastated by the sentence.

'What they have done to her, it’s not fair. She was prosecuted, but she was not defended,' said Wanda McIntyre, Ely’s grand-aunt.

'I’m sorry. I am so sorry that Sonia Jackson ended up with her child in a situation like this. But he and they did it. Charlie didn’t,' McIntyre said. 'She didn’t do this. Someone else did.'

Four other defendants, who ranged in age from 
15 to 20 at the time of their arrests, remain in jail awaiting trial on 
first-degree murder charges, prosecutors in Ocala said.

They are 
Michael Bargo, 19, Justin Soto, 20, Kyle Hooper, 17 and Amber Wright, 
15.

It was Amber Wright who was said to have been an ex-girlfriend of Seath's and the reason why Bargo - who then dated her - held a grudge against him.

Suspects: Justin Soto, 20, left, has been charged with murder and James Young Havens III, 37, charged with conspiracy to murder as police allege he knew about the plot and helped dispose of the body

Ely and Wright used a cell phone to 
text Seath and persuade him to come to Ely's home where three young men were 
waiting, according to the arrest affidavit.

Once inside the home, Seath was hit in the head with a wooden object and was shot multiple times with a .22 calibre , according to detectives. When he tried to escape, he was tackled, held down and shot again.

His body was then placed in a bath tub and his knee caps were broken. According to the report, when he was in the bathtub he started showing signs of life and was shot again.

He was then tied up, placed in a sleeping bag and burned in a fire pit.

Later, Jackson's remains were shovelled into five-gallon paint cans, 
authorities said.

The only motive for the killing noted in the 
arrest affidavit was that the alleged shooter, 19-year-old Michael Bargo, hated 
Jackson because of Wright.

A very public feud between the three involved in the love triangle was played out on Facebook.

It began on April 8 when Wright wrote on Seath's page: 'I got so tired of you treating me like I was nothing. If you're so perfect, why don't you get over your jealousy and get a new girl you can hurt. ... You know I cared deeply about you. I stuck with you through a lot of stuff. ... It takes a real man to accept the fact he got broken up with.'

He responded: 'We both need to just let all of this go. Yeah we split, yeah it hurt, but I'm over it. I'm just not going to let Mike (Bargo) have his cake and eat it too.'

Bargo's lawyer, Charles Holloman,said his client 'had affection' for Amber that sparked fury at Jackson.

'He was concerned about the way she was being treated. He wasn't the only one who was concerned,' the lawyer told ABC.

He admitted that his client had a record but added that Seath Jackson was 'no angel'.

However he acknowledges that 'killing someone, chopping them up and putting them in a bag (is) pretty damned depraved'.

At Ely's trial, Jackson's mother testified that her son and Bargo once argued 
in front of the Jackson home, according to a report in the Ocala Star-Banner 
newspaper.

Jurors deliberated about an hour before 
finding Ely guilty and told the newspaper they relied to a great extent on her 
videotaped confession.

According to the Star Banner, prosecutors have said that 
they will seek the death penalty against Bargo, who is alleged to have 
been the mastermind of the murder plot.

Speaking in a jail house interview 
shortly after Seath's death in April, Ely said she felt sorry for the 
victim's family but claims she only participated out of fear.

She said: 'They said that I'd be killed and it wasn't just a threat. It was a gun pointed in my face and everything.

'Words can't express what I want to say about it.'
