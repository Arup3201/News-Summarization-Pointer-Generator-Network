Mother-of-eleven Heather Frost faces having her £60,000-a-year benefits cut after receiving £2,000 to appear on TV and boast about her life.

The 37-year-old, who has never worked and claims around £60,000 a year in benefits, is currently appearing in a documentary series on Channel 5 called On Benefits and Proud.

But her local council said they would now
be investigating her huge hand-outs after reports she was given a substantial fee to appear on the show.

Unemployed: Heather Frost, pictured with one of her nine daughters at their taxpayer-funded six-bedroom home, could lose her benefits after receiving £6,000 to appear in a documentary

She caused outrage earlier this year when a council offered to build her and her enormous family a £500,000 eco-home.

The probe comes after Frost was questioned by police when she apparently admitted paying for stolen goods at her front door in last week’s programme.

The TV station would not comment about the payment but Robert Oxley of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: 'Life on welfare shouldn’t be an alternative to finding genuine work.

'Claimants have a duty to declare if their circumstances change as benefits are a safety net, not an alternative form of income.

'Taxpayers footing the bill will take a dim view of someone still claiming every penny they can while sitting on a handsome cheque for thousands.'

Richard Horton, revenues and benefits group manager at Tewkesbury Borough Council in Gloucestershire said it was their duty to investigate.

He refused to discuss Frost’s benefits but added: 'In all cases, if we believe there are grounds for an investigation then we are duty bound to carry one out.'

Frost, who gets £900-per-week in benefits, is featuring on the documentary which looks at a number of families from across the country who are supported by the state.

The first episode last Monday, focused on Frost and her quest to move into a £500,000 council-funded eco home.

Frost said on the show: 'People don’t agree with the benefit system but the system is there for people who can’t go out and work.

'Yes it is my choice to have a large family but there is no law to say how many kids you can have.'

Also featured on the series are a couple from Liverpool who have not worked for six years, and two single mothers in Camden whose rents are more than £1,200 a month each and are paid for by the state.

They are all believed to have received a fee from Channel 5 so the camera crews could enter their crews and part of their contract requires them to declare this money.

One couple, Vinnie Bienvenue and his new wife Julie, have also appeared on the Jeremy Kyle show in the past.

Mrs Bienvenue, 34, has six children and Vinnie has three, but they are yet to have their own child.

Frost was due to move into a specially built six-bedroomed home after she complained that her current house, in Churchdown, Glouscestershire, was unsafe.

She currently lives with her children, aged from four to 22, in two terraced houses that have been knocked together.

But she was refused the new taxpayer-funded home a few miles away just weeks later because the £500,000 property did not meet her needs.

The proposed house had three bathrooms, a large open-plan kitchen-diner and two lounges with French windows overlooking a spacious garden.

The 1,850 sq ft detached property was designed with state-of-the-art technology to cut electricity bills and has now been given to a new family.

The council will now make £2,000 worth of improvements to her two current homes.

Claudia Cobban, housing manager at Severn Vale Housing, said: 'We are planning to carry out minimal changes to the Frost’s current home to make it more suitable for the family’s needs.

'The changes will improve the connection been the two properties, providing a more permanent solution for the family.'

Frost first fell pregnant when she was 15 to a 23 year-old boyfriend who ended up in prison.

Her children are Sophie, 22, Toby, 20, Angel, 17, Jay, 15, Chloe, 13, Paige, 12, Emily, ten, Bethany, nine, Ruby, eight, Daisy, six, and Tilly, who is four.
