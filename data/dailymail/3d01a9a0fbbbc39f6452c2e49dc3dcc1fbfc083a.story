A father was sprayed in the face with a powerful chemical by police who arrested him for staging a sit-in protest at a supermarket about a faulty television set.

Officers squirted pava spray into Eric Rawlinson's eyes and struck him on both arms with a baton before removing him from the Tesco Extra store in handcuffs while staff and shoppers watched.

Mr Rawlinson, 41, had been protesting peacefully for four hours at the Swindon supermarket because staff told him they would not exchange his 10-month-old television, which had a faulty on-off switch.

But his demonstration ended dramatically after the store's manager called police.

Officers arrived to find the unemployed former design manager sitting on a swing chair in the corner of the electrical goods area.

After Mr Rawlinson told them he could not move, they squirted his eyes with the noxious spray - more potent than CS gas - and then struck his arms to release his grip from the chair.

He was handcuffed face down on the floor. Then two other police vans and two squad cars arrived.

Pava spray canisters, which are used by about 60 per cent of police forces in England and Wales, contain pelargonic acid vanillylamide and ethanol.

They are designed to minimise a suspect's ability to resist arrest without unnecessarily prolonging their discomfort.

Mr Rawlinson, a father-of-two from Abbey Meads, Swindon, described the encounter as 'the giants against the little people'.

'I was given an offer for a repair service but under my consumer rights I rejected it because I wanted an exchange,' he told the Swindon Advertiser.

'Too many people would go quietly and accept it but I believe I have a right of exchange.'

Mr Rawlinson said that staff were 'polite' but refused to back down over the Â£599 widescreen set.

PAVA spray is an incapacitant spray dispensed from a hand-held canister in a liquid stream propelled by nitrogen.

It is approved for police use in the UK, although many forces use the significantly less potent CS gas spray instead.

The liquid stream is a spray pattern and has a maximum effective range of up to 4 metres. Maximum accuracy, however, will be achieved over a distance of 1.25 to 2 metres.

PAVA primarily affects the eyes, causing closure and severe pain. The pain to the eyes is reported to be greater than that caused by CS.

The effectiveness rate is very high once PAVA gets into the eyes; however, there have been occasions where PAVA and CS have failed to work - especially when the subject is under the influence of alcohol or drugs

Exposure to fresh moving air will normally result in a significant recovery from the effects of PAVA within 15 to 35 minutes.

Both PAVA and CS are prohibited under s5 of the Firearms Act as a 'weapon of whatever description designed or adapted for the discharge of any noxious liquid, gas or other thing'.

While it is unlawful for a member of the public to possess them, police officers, as servants of the Crown, are exempt from this restriction.

Store manager Stuart Edginton said he was forced to call Wiltshire Police because Mr Rawlinson ignored repeated requests to leave and warnings from staff.

Mr Edginton called Tesco head office numerous times during the stand-off but he was advised to stick to the company's policy, which only offers a refund or exchange during the first 28 days after purchase.

A Tesco spokeswoman said: 'It is our policy to return a faulty item to the manufacturer for repairs and if these cannot be done, we will happily offer an exchange or refund.

'In this instance, as a gesture of goodwill, we also offered the customer an extended warranty on the product and the loan of another television.

'Unfortunately, the customer was not satisfied, and the police were called when he refused to leave the store after several hours.'

A spokesman for Wiltshire Police 
said: 'When officers arrived at the supermarket, the male was asked to 
leave the store, but refused to do so.

'Despite
officers best efforts to resolve the situation, the male refused to 
leave the store so was arrested for breach of the peace but resisted 
officers when they tried to arrest him.

'In trying to restrain the male, officers were required to use pava spray and an asp (police baton).

'The
first officers arrived at the scene approximately 10 minutes after the 
call but when the man became aggressive, officers called for emergency 
assistance and a further four units were called as precaution.'

Mr Rawlinson was seen by a police doctor but did not require any medical treatment.

He was cautioned for obstructing an officer in course of their duty before being released.
