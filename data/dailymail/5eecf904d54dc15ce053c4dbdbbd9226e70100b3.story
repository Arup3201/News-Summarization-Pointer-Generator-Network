It appears British holidaymakers are turning back the clock when they travel abroad as 40 becomes the new 30.

More Britons aged 40 and over are shedding the notion that their wild streak is behind them and booking booze-fuelled packages that are normally geared toward younger adults.

A survey suggests late nights, bars and alcohol are a feature for a quarter of more mature holidaymakers.

More Britons over 40 are booking booze-fuelled holiday packages normally geared toward younger adults

Women who went on such wild getaways knocked back an average 20 units of alcohol a day – the equivalent of two bottles of wine – while men sank 27 units.

More than a third (37 per cent) admitted they were hung over every morning during their trip. 

The study by online travel agents sunshine.co.uk questioned 2,764 UK adults aged 40 and over, all of whom have been abroad this year.

The most popular holidays were cruising breaks (38 per cent) and laid-back beach breaks (31 per cent), but 24 per cent had been on a holiday usually associated with younger people.

Sixteen per cent of respondents said they went on a booze-fuelled break as a guest on a hen or stag do

Twenty-four per cent said they had been on a holiday usually associated with younger people

Most chose Spain as the place to let their hair down with Majorca (21 per cent), Ibiza (16 per cent) and the mainland (11 per cent) making up the top three destinations.

Cyprus (nine per cent) and Turkey (six per cent) came in fourth and fifth, respectively.

Forty-one per cent said they went on a booze-fuelled break to ‘let off steam’ while 16 per cent were a guest on a hen or stag do.

Eleven per cent said they were letting loose after a break-up.

Women  knocked back an average 20 units of alcohol a day while men sank 27 units

Chris Clarkson, managing director of sunshine.co.uk, said: “Booze-fuelled holidays are clearly not just for 18 to 30 year olds.

‘Perhaps resorts like San Antonio and Magaluf are being taken over by the older generations now, as they look to let off some steam and party hard.

‘We were surprised that these wild holidays are the third most popular type of trip for those aged 40 and over though.

‘Still, each to their own. Holidays should be about doing what you want to do, not what everyone else does or says you should be doing. If you can keep up with the youngsters, go for it.
