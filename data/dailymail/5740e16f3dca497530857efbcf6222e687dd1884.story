A mother-of-two  received an emotional trip down memory lane when a time capsule hidden by her late father 28 years ago was discovered by the new owners of her childhood home.

Claire Brissenden remembers helping her father Ivan refurbish the family home in Heaton, Newcastle in the late 1980s but she had no idea he had used the renovation to hide a time capsule in her bedroom.

So the 43-year-old was amazed when she picked up a Facebook message from the new owners of the house, informing her of the  find.

This week Ms Brissenden took her family back to the house she had not set foot in for quarter of a century to see for the first time the contents of the 1987 package, including a letter written by her late father Ivan when she was just 15.

'It's weird,' she said as she arrived with husband Anton Lang and excited children Zoe, seven, and five-year-old Dexter.

'I feel quite emotional,' said Claire, who was the youngest child and very close to her father, who died five years ago at the age of 85. 'But I'm disappointed there's not more personal stuff in there like a photo.

The time capsule was put together in 1987 and includes a handwritten letter from Ms Brissenden's father and a copy of the Mail on Sunday

Ivan Brissenden (pictured), Claire's late father, had hidden the time capsule while he was revamping the Newcastle home they shared in the 1980s - but she had no idea that he'd hidden a time capsule in her bedroom

The package had been wrapped in plastic on which was written 'Documents from the year 1987. Please open'.

Inside, among tin foil wrapping, was a copy of the Mail on Sunday- then just 40p- the Independent and You Magazine alongside Ms Brissenden's father's letter noting historic details from the time.

In it he wrote: 'My name is Ivan Brissenden. I have been converting this room for my daughter Claire, aged 15. This note was written in June 1987

The young couple had found the time capsule after rolling back the carpet in one of the bedrooms as they set about renovating their first home, and saw the words: 'Stop! time capsule behind here'

When the homeowners looked behind the board they found the time capsule wrapped in plastic upon which had been written 'Documents from the year 1987. Please open'

'You will see that we have just witnessed the incredible General Election, in which Margaret Thatcher, Britain's first woman Prime Minister was re-elected for a third term- the first tine this has happened for 150 years.

'I have no idea how long it will be before this note is found. But I thought you, the finder, might be interested in the enclosed. I hope it will show you a bit of what life was like in the closing years of the twentieth century.'

The time capsule was discovered by Chris Pearson, 24, and 23-year-old Beth Barnes, a civil engineer, after rolling back the carpet in one of the bedrooms as they set about renovating their first home.

First they saw the words: 'Stop! Time capsule behind here' then a package wrapped in tape and plastic which they opened.

'Anyone would have been intrigued!' said Newcastle University PhD student Chris.

After coming across Ms Brissenden's name in her father's letter, Chris was able to track her down on Facebook and sent her a message.

But it was three years later when the mother-of-three finally checked her inbox and got in touch with the couple.

Ms Brissenden, who was brought up by her dad, a creative director of an advertising company,  said the idea of his making up a time capsule did not surprise her.

'At the time Blue Peter was doing a lot of stuff about time capsules!' she said.

But what did surprise her was the fact this one was not presented in quite the way she would expect from someone so creative.

'It's a manky plastic bag - I wanted a time capsule!' she said.

Chris and Beth now plan to rebury the time capsule in another location in the house.

The contents of the capsule: It included the handwritten letter from Ivan Brissenden and a copy of the Mail on Sunday dated June 14, 1987 with You Magazine and a copy of The Independent
