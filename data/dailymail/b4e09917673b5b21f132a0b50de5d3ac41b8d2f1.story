She is the hardest working and hardest
partying woman in pop music and to promote her new album, Unapologetic, Rihanna set off on an ambitious globetrotting tour that hit seven countries in seven days.

But with so many late nights of performing and partying, how did the pop princess maintain her dazzling appearance night after night?

Fashion magazine InStyle joined Rihanna on board the party jet for every destination and have shared an exclusive video documenting how the team behind her look make-up and keep up with the pop 
sensation.

Speaking to InStyle about her evolving 
hairstyles her hair stylist Yussef said: 'I was sent to her by God, 
haha, no it was through mutual management trying to put us two together,
finally one day I had chance to work with her at Paris Fashion week a 
few years ago and it was a good marriage.'

The 24-year-old has been through a series of dramatic hair styles from long beachy blonde locks to sharp pixie dos.

Speaking about her favourite hair style he said: 'This year, I love the looks that we did from We Found Love.

'It was very relaxed, natural, undone, and at that time it was a moment for the album.

'She is spontaneous and I am but we never really fight over how we should do it. I'm usually bringing something to the table and she's like "alright" or she will come to me and say "I want to do this."'

Spontaneous: Her hairdresser describes her hair style evolution as spontaneous

Describing the evolution of her hair style and her new cropped jet black look he said: 'Because we went from doing the We Found Love video and her hair was blonde and an ombre situation, we were flying to Tokyo and we were like let's go jet black and then on top of that I had clippers, and I was like ... how about and next thing you know...'

Famed (and envied) for her toned physique, most people assume Rihanna is on a strict diet, but according to her personal chef she loves a good curry.

'She loves pasta, any Carribean food, chicken, her favourite is curry,' said chef Kamal.

When asked if she ate healthily he replied: 'Look at her, it doesn't really matter.'

Hearty appetite: Although she has a killer body, her chef maintains that she loves a good curry

With so many round-the-clock performances (and not to mention after hours parties), it comes as no surprise that Rihanna has her own personal masseuse.

Lama, her masseuse said: 'I'm for her, to relax her and to get her ready for shows.

'This job, people don't understand how much energy it takes for an artist to be able to travel like this and get on stage and do all these different things.

'I think it's great to have herself taken care of, if she feels tired, she can't perform,' she added.

The fashion stylist for Rihanna’s incredible 777 tour has previously praised the singer’s notoriously wild style, describing her as ‘fearless’.

Mel Ottenburg, who is the style 
genius behind some of the superstars most outlandish looks, had never 
been tempted to dress a celebrity before Rihanna  but said he could not 
resist the opportunity to work with the singer.

Speaking in the video he said: 'We love Givenchy, Tom Ford, Kenzo.'She has killer style and she's cool and really inspired.

'Her body is great to dress, she wears clothes well and she gets it, she knows her body.'
