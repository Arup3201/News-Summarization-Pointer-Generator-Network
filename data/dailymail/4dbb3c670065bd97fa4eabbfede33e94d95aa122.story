While officials initially claimed that the strike on the U.S. consulate in Libya was a protest gone wrong, new evidence has suggested that there were obvious clues that terrorism was involved.

The consulate assault, which occurred on the 11th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, led to the deaths of four Americans - including Ambassador Chris Stevens.

Confusion over what sparked the Benghazi violence may have stemmed from the CIA, which distributed 'talking points' to top officials on September 14.

Deadly attack: The consulate was reportedly bombed twice in the months leading up to the attack, which occurred on the eleventh anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks

The unclassified documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, said in part: 'The currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault against the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi and subsequently its annex.'

'There are indications that extremists participated in the violent demonstrations.'

Likely working off the CIA document, 
government officials like UN Ambassador Susan Rice and White House Press
 Secretary Jay Carney, said there was little evidence the violence was 
planned.

However, the document went on to say that the 'assessment may change as additional information is collected' and that the investigation is 'on-going.'

Additionally, The Daily Beast reported that an intercepted phone call between a local militia group and al-Qaeda's north Africa arm, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), indicated that the two factions worked and planned the attack together.

On Saturday, the Obama 
administration admitted that it knew within 24 hours that the strike 
was a pre-planned terrorist attack and not by crazed protestors enraged 
by an anti-Islam film.

Senior U.S. officials have now 
confessed the government privately labelled the attack a terrorist act 
almost immediately after it happened, and even knew that the 
perpetrators had links to al-Qaeda.

Shawn Turner, a spokesman for 
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, said that as U.S. 
intelligence subsequently learned more about the attack, 'we revised our
 initial assessment to reflect new information indicating that it was a 
deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists.'

Turner said it remained 'unclear' if 
any individual or specific group commanded the attack. U.S. agencies 
nonetheless believe that some of the militants involved in the attack 
were 'linked to groups affiliated with, or sympathetic to al-Qaeda.'

Rep Peter King, a senior Republican from New York, demanded last week that Rice resign over her statement that the Benghazi attack was not premeditated.

Response: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has promised a full and open inquiry into the attack, which occurred on the 11th anniversary of 9/11

The State Department rejected King's call this afternoon, defending Rice and saying she has done 'a superb job.'

Last week, Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton admitted there was an explicit link between the al-Qaeda network
 in North Africa and the deadly attacks that killed Ambassador Stevens as well as information management officer Sean
 Smith and security personnel Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty..

Speaking at a Security Council 
meeting at the United Nations, Mrs Clinton said an Algerian-founded 
branch of the al-Qaeda network was situated in the area, using their 
location to plan and execute attacks, like the one in Benghazi on 
September 11.
