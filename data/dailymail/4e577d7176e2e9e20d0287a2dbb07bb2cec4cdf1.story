Michael Martin has been known to his high school friends as a star goalie, a gifted swimmer and an avid nature lover, but there was one thing he had been keeping them in the dark about: he was gay.

All that changed during a school dance earlier this year when the Musselman High School senior invited another young man to a slow dance.

As Taylor Swift's song Love Story came over the speakers, a nervous Martin and the homecoming king held hands and swayed to the melody in front of the whole school.

Star athlete: Martin is an all-state goalie on his school soccer team and also plays on the football and tennis teams 

Living in the shadows: Martin (center bottom row) wrote in a personal essay that growing up in rural West Virginia, he could never imagine telling anyone he was gay   

Last week, the all-state soccer goalie wrote a poignant personal essay about his inspiring coming out story for SB Nation's Outsports website.

'It was something I thought I'd never do -- dance a slow dance with the homecoming king at his high school,' the young athlete wrote.

Martin explained that growing up in rural West Virginia, he was afraid to be mocked by his friends and ostracized by his family and neighbors for being openly gay.

Yet on the night of the homecoming dance in October, for the first time in his life Martin was dancing with another man.

'It was a weird feeling for me, since I had just barely started coming out,' the 18-year-old confided. 'I was nervous yet excited.'

After the party, Martin asked his date - a boy from another school named Jem - to be his boyfriend.

'I posed the question by writing it on the dry erase board on his wall. He quickly said yes,’ Martin revealed in writing.

Split opinion: Martin, pictured with female cheerleaders, said most people at hs school have accepted him, but there also have been some negative remarks about his coming out, especially from the jocks 

Two weeks later, it was homecoming dance at Martin's high school, and the star goalie and member of the Musselman High School football, tennis and swimming teams decided to use the opportunity to reveal his true identity as a gay man to his own classmates.

The 18-year-old and his new boyfriend danced the night away in the school cafeteria, and whenever someone would come up to Martin and ask him if he and Jem were together, he would say, 'yes.'

But as word about his sexuality spread around the school in the days following the party, Martin discovered that not everyone was ready to accept him for who he was.

'"He is a f***** now," I was told some people said,' wrote Martin.

The senior explained that from a very young age, he knew that he was attracted to boys, but he could not fathom sharing his feelings with his ultra-conservative and devout family, or with anyone else in their isolated mountainous community.

Even as a freshman in high school, Martin said on the most part he kept mum about his sexuality for fear of becoming a pariah at school, where some of his teammates have been known to casually throw around gay slurs.

Inspiring figure: Martin's essay, published last Tuesday, has since gone viral drawing the courageous teenagers much praise from the LGBT community

Bright future: After graduating high school next spring, Martin is hoping to continue playing soccer on the college level 

It wasn't until his junior year that Martin finally mastered the courage to come out to his best friend on the soccer team, but even then he waited until the season was over, just to be on the safe side.

To his relief, the teammate reassured Martin that his being gay will not change their friendship.

Now feeling more confident about himself, Martin began laying the groundwork for a public reveal, which came on the day of the homecoming dance in Jem's school in a neighboring county, followed by the dance at his own school.

Martin wrote in his touching essay that it was the coming out story of Los Angeles Galaxy player Robbie Roberts that ultimately inspired him to cast aside his anxiety and emerge from the shadows. 

While some people have been critical of the openly gay teen, he has made many new friends  

‘I didn't want to hide how I really was any more,’ he stated. ‘I didn't want to live every day with a secret hanging over my head. I told my team before my own parents.’ 

When players on Martin's soccer team learned he was gay, some of them could not believe it at first, telling him he 'always acted so straight.'

Martin wrote he has made many new friends since coming out, and most of his teammates have accepted him.

Looking beyond his high school experience, which will come to an end next spring, Martin says he has been in talks with college soccer coaches about playing for their schools.

‘That will be a whole new level, a whole new school, group of friends, and new teammates,’ he wrote. ‘But I won't be afraid of being myself since I am proud to play as an athlete who happens to be gay.’

Martin's essay, published last Tuesday, has since gone viral, drawing  much praise from the LGBT community, including the source of his inspiration, Robbie Roberts, who even sent him a signed copy of his new autobiography with a personal inscription.

'I would have never have thought that my story would reach so many people... ,’ Martin summed up on his Instragram page.
