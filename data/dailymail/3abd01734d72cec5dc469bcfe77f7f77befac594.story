A boy hailed as China's miracle baby' after he was born when his mother was killed in a road accident has finally been adopted by his uncle and grandmother.

Pingan Zhao's mother had been in labour when she and her husband were hit by a truck as they travelled  on a motorbike to a hospital in Xiamen city in south-eastern China's Fujian province.

Both Wang Zhao, 40, and her husband Mao, 42, were killed in the accident, but not before Mrs Zhao gave birth at the scene in March this year.

After Pingan was born, Chinese media reported that he had been 'catapulted from his mother's womb as the truck ran over her, ending up ten feet away from her.

This unbelievable, and untrue, story of his birth led to him becoming a local celebrity and hailed as a 'miracle baby'.

Baby Pingan suffered from minor bruises  when he was found at the scene of the accident, and has since undergone minor brain surgery.

Police spokesman Chan Chien said: 'Eye witnesses said that when the woman was hit by the truck she gave birth on the spot. '

'Others said that the baby which was a healthy 4.2 kg had been thrown out of the woman's belly and had landed three meters away.

'What we found out from her family is that the woman, a 40-year-old, had gone into labour at 8:30 AM and her husband, a 42-year-old man, decided to take her by motorbike to the hospital rather than waiting for an ambulance. 

'The accident happened as they approached the junction of Maqing Lu and Jiaosong Lu.'

Police confirmed soon after the accident that they had arrested a 45-year-old truck driver who had apparently turned into the road just as the motorbike was coming along.

Now Pingan Zhao, who has been dubbed miracle baby, has been adopted by his uncle Yanchao Zhao and his grandmother Kaixing Xiao.

Yanchao said: 'I lost my older brother to an absolute tragedy, now I have a duty to see him live on in Pingan.

'He already has his eyes and his mother's smile.

'I shall love and treasure him as I know they would have done.'

A spokesman from Beiiing Tian Tan Hospital said: 'The baby has had an MRI scan because he is suffering from hydrocephalus, water on the brain, which was caused by the accident.

'He will need to undergo more surgery although we do not think his condition is serious.

'He truly is a miracle baby.'
