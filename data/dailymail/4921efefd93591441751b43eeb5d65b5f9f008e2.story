Pocket rocket: Mathieu Valbuena has attracted interest from West Ham and QPR

Marseille had agreed a fee with Dinamo Moscow but the player
refused to go.

West Ham formally announced the signing of striker Enner
Valencia from Pachuca on Tuesday, their fifth signing of the summer.

With 
club-record signing Andy Carroll ruled out for four months following 
surgery on an ankle injury, Sam Allardyce was desperate for a boost to 
his fortunes and with three goals in three games at the World Cup 
Valencia could be news he needed.

Valencia, 24, joins on a five-year contract after attracting attention from around Europe.
