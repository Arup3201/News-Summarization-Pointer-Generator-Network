A 'sadistic' asylum seeker who forced his former girlfriend to witness him stabbing her sister and her friend to death after she refused to take him back has been jailed for life.

Afghan national Ahmad Otak laughed and spat on 17-year-old Kimberley Frank’s body after stabbing her 15 times at her home in Yorkshire while her sister Elisa watched helplessly.

He then tied his ex-partner up with electrical flex and lured her friend Samantha Sykes, 18, to Kimberley’s flat in Wakefield, where he stabbed the teenager repeatedly before slitting her throat.

'Sadistic': Afghan asylum-seeker Ahmad Otak will serve a minimum of 34 years for the murders of Kimberley Frank and Samantha Sykes

Otak, who admitted two counts of murder at a previous hearing at Leeds Crown Court, was ordered to serve a minimum of 34 years in jail by a judge who described the 21-year-old as an 'inadequate, controlling man', who 'out of childish jealousy and vicious spite murdered two women in cold blood'.

Leeds Crown Court was told how Otak abducted his ex-girlfriend Elisa, 19, after killing the two women, using Miss Sykes' car to drive to Dover in a failed bid to flee to France.

His plan was foiled when a fellow refugee managed to raise the alarm.

After being arrested the murderer claimed he was aided in the killing by Elisa Frank, who he had planned to marry.

Leeds Crown Court was told that Elisa had met Otak in a children's home after he arrived in the UK from Afghanistan in 2007, claiming he was 16 years old.

The pair had an on-off relationship and had planned to marry in 2011, but when Otak became more controlling Miss Frank called off the wedding, the court heard.

Prosecutor Richard Mansell QC said: 'He said that even if she didn't marry him she could not leave him. He told her that he would go crazy and would kill people.'

'He said that...she could not leave him. He told her that he would go crazy and kill people'

He later claimed he was joking but 
later threatened to kill Elisa, her friends and members of family - 
including his eventual victims Samantha Sykes and Miss Frank's sister 
Kimberley.

'He told her that if she stayed with him she would be saving lives,' Mr Mansell said.

On one occasion after Elisa had 
shouted at Otak he produced a knife and told her that if she screamed he
 would sew her mouth shut.

Mr.Mansell
 said Elisa was too frightened to report what had happened to the police
 but Samantha Sykes, 18, was not and reported Otak to the UK Border 
Agency as an illegal immigrant and contacted police, but no action was 
taken because Elisa declined to make a statement.

In
 September last year she finally decided to leave him for good but 
relented when he threatened to throw acid in her face and petrol bomb 
her mother's house.

On one occasion Otak said he had prepared 'kill list' of 12 people he believed were trying to split the couple up.

'Horrific': Otak, left, stabbed Kimberley Frank (right with her sister Elisa Frank) to death at her home in Wakefield while her sister watched helplessly

In March this year Elisa Frank moved out of the flat they shared in Wakefield, West Yorks.

On
 March 9th after she demanded her belongings back from Otak, he went and
 bought a carving knife and went to Kimberley's flat in Barden Road, 
Wakefield, where she was with Elisa, who had again refused to go back to
 Otak.

All three were in 
the hallway when Otak suddenly attacked Kimberley. 'He stabbed and 
slashed her repeatedly with the knife in a frenzied attack,' said 
Mr.Mansell.

She had 15 wounds, the court heard including a massive stab wound to the neck.

Scene: The bodies of murdered teenagers Kimberley Frank and Samantha Sykes were found at Miss Frank's flat in Wakefield

After
 the killing Otak ordered Elisa to sit down and claimed she had made him
 do it and if she had gone back to him it would not have happened.

Otak took Miss Sykes car after he killed her and drove to to Dover in a bid to flee to France

Mr.Mansell said: 'At one point he stood over Kimberley's body, laughed, licked blood from the knife and spat on her.

'He
 then told Elisa he was going to kill more people and made her send 
several text messages to Samantha Sykes, asking her to come to the 
flat.'

He then tied Elisa 
up with electrical flex. When Samantha arrived at the flat Otak let her 
in and then attacked her, stabbing and slashing her repeatedly.

After
 the killings Otak took his ex-girlfriend and drove to Dover in Miss 
Sykes' car in a bid to flee to France, but was arrested when an Iranian 
illegal immigrant who was trying to get out of the UK helped Elisa get 
free after she told him her story as they tried to board a lorry.

After
 his arrest Otak claimed he had carried out the killings for Elisa 
'whose plan it was', telling police 'she forced me to do this thing. She
 said "kill my sister and friend".'

He said he killed Samantha because she was a model and he was jealous of her.

Mr.Jonathan
 Turner QC, defending said that although the 'horror of his actions can 
not be explained' he said they were the actions of a man not in full 
control of his own mind.

Jailing Otak for 34 years, less 241 days spent in custody, Mr.Justice Coulson told him it was an 'horrific case'.
