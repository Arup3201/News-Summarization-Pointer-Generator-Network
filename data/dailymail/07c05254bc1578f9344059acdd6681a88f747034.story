'Insensitive': Joey Barton described suicide as a 'selfish' act

Footballer Joey Barton was at the centre of controversy today over comments he made on Twitter about the death of Gary Speed, describing suicide as a 'selfish' act.

Despite an outcry from other users on the social networking site, the QPR captain has refused to apologise for his 'insensitive' comments.

Welsh football legend Gary Speed was tragically found hanged at his home on Sunday morning in what is thought to have been suicide.

Like countless others, Barton took to Twitter to speak of his shock at Speed's death and to pay tribute to him.

He posted: 'Just hearing about Gary Speed, to say am shocked is an understatement.

'My thoughts are with his family and friends. Really sad news.'

However, his tributes were then swiftly followed - with astonishingly tactless timing - by his views on suicide.

The outspoken footballer added: 'Suicide is a mix of the most tragic, most selfish, most terrible (and I want to believe preventable) acts out there.'

As Twitter users bombarded Barton in an online backlash, the star - unrepentant - branded his critics as having 'half a brain' instead of apologising for his offensive comments.

He added: 'Feedback on here, small minority as usual strongly disagree with what I said. If they read carefully or had half a brain, they'd understand.'

Last night his comments were 
criticised by football fans and suicide counselling groups, with Malcolm
Clarke - chairman of the Football Supporters' Federation - telling the 
Daily Star: 'This is completely insensitive and inappropriate.

'It is disrespectful to Gary's 
family. We should be concentrating on the positive impact he made on the
game at a time like this.'

Meanwhile counsellor Beth Neil, from 
the Welsh branch of Survivors of Bereavement By Suicide, added: 'He has 
no idea what kind of trauma Gary was going through. This is just sick.'

Many Twitter users also rounded on Barton. One user, Leazeslad, said: If anyone 
is in any doubt about what a p**** Joey Barton is, read his tweet about 
selfishness and suicide, on this day of all days.'
