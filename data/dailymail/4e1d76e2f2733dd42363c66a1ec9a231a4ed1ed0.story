Dodge has unveiled its most powerful car ever – the 707 horsepower Challenger SRT Hellcat.

The muscle car tops the competition with a 6.2 liter V8 HEMI engine that comes in either an eight-speed automatic or a six-speed manual transmission, the car maker announced. 

It is being positioned against the supercharged likes of Ford’s Shelby Mustangs and Chevrolet’s Camaro ZR1 models.

The most powerful mass produced American car ever made even comes with two sets of keys, according to Fox News.

‘One that restricts the engine to 500 hp and another that opens the gates of the Hellcat,' said Fox.

Both sets are actually keyless ignition key fobs, according to CNN Money.

Even with just the black key fob, the supped-up Challenger has 15 more horsepower than the next fastest model of the Challenger.

‘I thought we'd reached the point of ridiculous horsepower numbers when the Corvette ZR1 hit in 2009 with 638 horsepower,’ Karl Brauer, a senior director at the automotive Web site KBB.com, told CNN Money.

‘Clearly I was off, as the horsepower wars appear to have only just begun.’

Gas mileage and pricing have not been publicly released by the automaker, but expect both to be wallet-busting.

The beast will hit showroom floors in the fall. A four-door model is also expected to be released.

The Dodge may be the fastest American muscle car off an assembly line, but it did have to overcome some stiff competition.

The Dodge Viper SRT clocks in at 640 horsepower, and the Corvette ZR1 comes with a cool 638 horses under the hood.

No matter which one a buyer chooses, they would be hard-pressed to find a faster automobile made in the U.S.A.
