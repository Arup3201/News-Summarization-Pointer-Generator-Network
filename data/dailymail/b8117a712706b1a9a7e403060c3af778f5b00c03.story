Clutching a plastic bag and sporting a winter hat and beard, he looks just any other New Yorker riding the Subway home.

But look a little a closer and you might notice this isn't your average commuter. 

Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who has a net worth of $17.5 billion, was snapped travelling on a downtown train late on Sunday night.

Google co-founder Sergey Brin was photographed travelling on the New York Subway on Sunday

And while he didn't appear to be the most glamorous of passengers, he was sporting his company's yet to be released Google Glasses - worth $1,500 a pair. 

Brooklyn resident Niah Zerkin captured the moment on his camera and even had a quick chat with the multi-billionaire. 

It is not the first time Brin has worn the internet spectacles out in public.

The augmented-reality goggles allow users to find out the time, the temperature, talk to a friend or get directions.

They are not yet on sale but a promotional video promoting the gadget called Project Glass was  released last year prompting claims they are going to revolutionise the way we live.

The wraparound glasses feature a miniature display that sits above one eye, allowing users to surf the internet, make video calls, listen to music and update the diary without lifting a finger.

Prototype: Google co-founder Sergey Brin has been the company evangelist for the product and has been spotted wearing the Google Glasses at various events

The screen is controlled by voice and by tilting your head.

A prototype is being tweaked and tested in public by the company’s employees before it goes on sale.

The technology, known as ‘wearable computing’, is expected to launch a new generation of gadgets which display a layer of information over everything the wearer sees.

The glasses are mainly voice-controlled to bring up contacts, send emails and search the web

The wearer can even be given information instantly from buildings they are looking at, landmarks or friends in the area. 

The technology was unveiled last April and demoed when Brin sky-dived into a Google conference wearing a pair. 

They are expected to go on sale to consumers by early to 2014.
