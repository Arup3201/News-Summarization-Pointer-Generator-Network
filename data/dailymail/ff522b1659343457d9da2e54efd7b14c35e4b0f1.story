George Osborne is facing a Cabinet revolt over plans to impose tolls on Britain's roads.

Senior ministers regard the plans - which the Chancellor wants included in a coalition relaunch document in January - as 'a new pasty tax' that will undermine Tory chances of winning the next election.

Ministers and officials have privately voiced concerns that the proposals cannot be made to work and would lead to 'electoral suicide'.

The Chancellor's plans could put him at odds with the Prime Minister

The Tories spent years denouncing Labour for waging a 'war on motorists' but Mr Osborne believes getting foreign investors to build new roads and pay for them with tolls will kickstart growth.

But his calls for road tolls to be included in January's midterm review are causing widespread irritation among his ministerial colleagues.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has concerns about selling a road tax plan to the public. Allies say he sees the advantages of putting investment on a firm footing but one added: 'He can see the political challenges.'

Senior ministers like Michael Gove, Philip Hammond and Theresa May are understood to be concerned that a road toll scheme would upset Middle Britain. One ministerial aide told the Mail: 'This is nuts.

'We slagged off Labour for years for taxing motorists off the roads and now we seem to want to do the same.

'This just doesn't make sense. The problem with the pasty tax and the caravan tax and all that was that the Treasury put revenue-raising before common sense politics. We shouldn't go there again.'

The plans could put the Chancellor at odds with Prime Minister David Cameron, who is concerned that slapping tolls on motorways would drive traffic onto minor roads in the countryside.

A second senior government source said: 'Cameron only wants it if there are no losers and it's hard to see how you can get to that point. People are concerned about it across the board - ministers, Treasury officials, the lot.'

Plans to put tolls on certain lanes - branded Lexus lanes because they would create a two-tier system have already been dismissed as reinforcing the notion that the Tories treat wealthy voters differently from those struggling to make ends meet.

Others are concerned that a charging scheme dependent on every driver having every trip they every make recorded on CCTV cameras would lead to claims of a surveillance state.

'I can imagine the fuss people would make about snoopers,' said one source.

A Liberal Democrat official said that while the junior coalition partner was not opposed to the plans there is scepticism that a solution can be found.

The coalition Mid Term Review is expected to include an intention to examine road pricing but no concrete proposal.
