The family and friends of a young Missouri woman are reeling after police say she was shot dead by her school teacher boyfriend, who then took his own life.

The bodies of Jamie Lee Newkirk, 27, and Jason Crabtree, 33, were discovered early Sunday morning inside a wrecked SUV in Overland Park.

Crabtree taught second-grade at Gracemor Elementary School in the North Kansas City School District, where he was said to be loved by his students and admired by his colleagues.

Grisly find: Police responded to a report of a car crash in Overland Park Sunday, only to discover the bodies of Newkirk and her boyfriend

Miss Newkirk worked as a manager at Nordstrom at Oak Park Mall while attending college at Kansas State University, where she earned a bachelor's degree in apparel and textiles in 2012.

Those who knew her said the vivacious 27-year-old woman aspired to a career in the fashion industry. 

‘Her college friends and her co-workers all have the same remarks: “She had an infectious laugh, a contagious smile and a passion for life,"’ the family said in a statement to the station KMBC.

Investigators are still trying to piece together what may have led to the tragic murder-suicide.

At around 1am last Sunday, Overland Park police responded to a report of a car accident near College Boulevard and Mastin Street, KCTV reported.

Officers who arrived on the scene came upon an SUV that slammed into a fence near a sewage station. Inside, they found the bodies of Newkirk and Crabtree. The couple were dead from gunshot wounds.

Miss Newkirk is survived by her parents and four sisters. She will be laid to rest Thursday following a service at Souder Family Funeral Home.

On her Facebook page, Morgan Newkirk, one of Jamie’s siblings, wrote: ‘Here is what my darling sister thought me: eat good food; always look good; listen to good music (although we will disagree on what that music is); visit a beach as often as you can; surround yourself with the best of friends and family; lift your head high; live, love and laugh like crazy. Love you Jame!’

Meanwhile, friends, former classmates, co-workers and customers have been flocking to the Souder Family Funeral Home's website to pay tribute to Miss Newkirk , who was remembered as a hopeful young woman full of joy and kindness. 

‘Jamie was my manager at Nordstrom, and I will never forget the way in which she held herself. She was a strong, intelligent, kind, and hilarious person,’ Tara Singhal wrote on the online celebration wall.

Another co-worker Leah Gibson wrote: ‘She always made me laugh, sometimes to the point I couldn't breathe! She had the confidence that I looked up to and tried to imitate. She always believed in us, and always encouraged us to be the best we could be.’

The Newkirk family have set up a scholarship in Jamie’s name, which will be awarded to Kansas State students who wish to pursue a career in fashion.
