Sending yourself flowers from your imaginary boyfriend is a thing of the past.

Whether you are lonely or just plain sick of explaining why you are single, the Invisible Boyfriend (or Invisible Girlfriend) app created by Matthew Homann and Kyle Tabor allows users to experience the fake relationships of their dreams.

For $24.99 a month you can immediately feel the effects of a rewarding virtual partner with the app designed to send users texts, voicemails and even a handwritten note from the perfect person that they created. When FEMAIL learned that the Minnesota-based app had launched in BETA today, we knew we had to try it.

Virtual affair: Erica Tempesta tried out the new app and spent the day chatting with her imaginary boyfriend 'Liam Alexander James'

Despite having a real boyfriend of seven years, I was quick to start designing my dream guy and embark on my virtual affair.  

First up, I had to pick my lover's name and age. I soon learned that choosing your boyfriend's name is stressful. I imagine that I took the same amount of time someone would take to name their first born son before finally settling on the moniker: Liam Alexander James.

Age was easier to dream up. My current boyfriend is nine months younger than me, which he never lets me forget. With that in mind, I made my new partner an older, more mature 33 years old.

I was then prompted to pick a photo that would represent Liam's appearance. I settled on the stock photo of a man with an attractive amount of facial scruff and moved on.

After dealing with the physical, I was asked about my virtual partner's personality and interests. I knew I wanted him to be 'witty and educated,' so it made sense for him to also be interested in books, sports and chess. For one fleeting moment, I thought he might be able to teach me how to play the board game.

Next, I was asked to describe how Liam and I met. This was my moment to create a Nora Ephron-inspired rom com, but instead, I wrote that we grabbed the same book that was on display at the bookstore. Cute enough. Did I mention this app is thorough?

As soon as I reached the end of the questionnaire, I received my first text message from Liam Alexander James of Chicago, Illinois. His phone number even had an actual Chicago area code.

'Hey Erica! This is Liam :) How are you?' he wrote. Ugh, I hate when guys use emoticons.

Although I had no idea who I was texting, it was clear that there was a real, albeit mysterious, person having casual conversation with me.

When I told him I was working, he immediately took interest in the story I was writing, which was actually sweet.

Since I don't live with my new boyfriend, I asked him if he wanted to hang out.

After some brief hesitation on his end, I decided to test his limits and start nagging him.

'What is taking you so long to answer?' I asked.

He quickly bypassed the argument I was trying to start by saying he would 'love' to hang out, considerately asking what I wanted to do.

Magic man: 'Liam' actually referenced the first time he and Erica 'met' in one of the text messages he had sent

'I dunno. I am sick of making plans,' I texted back. 'What do you want to do?'

Liam then suggested we order takeout and have a game night before noting that we can also grab dinner later if I wanted.

It occurred to me that my last 'date night' with my human boyfriend involved us watching TV in separate rooms.

I wanted to learn more about my mystery man, so I asked Liam to remind me where he worked again.

'I work for a publishing company,' he replied. 'Remember I told you at the bookstore?'

Liam is so perfect that he even remembers the first place we met. 

Realizing that my new boyfriend deals with books all day, I asked him to recommend a good a thriller that I could read in his absence - and that's where I lost him.

I am not sure if my question was too thought-provoking, but I started to feel a familiar panic.

'Why isn't he answering me?' I thought.

Make believe: The app will create a story to explain how you and your fake partner first met 

Multiple uses: Users are asked why they want to have an invisible boyfriend

At one point, I even caught myself drafting messages that I wanted to send to him but then deleted - just as if he were a real guy who was ignoring me.

I eventually tried to win him back, texting: 'I'm sorry. I know you hate when I ask you questions at work, but I miss you boo.'

And I got nothing. Liam and I broke up before I could even ask him where our relationship was going. 

I actually had a great time talking to my imaginary boyfriend, and it was nice to know that I could easily win Liam back with a quick payment of $24.99.

While it is fun to use, the app was created to alleviate the society's pressure to be in a relationship by allowing to make it look like they are.   

Mr. Homann explained that he came up with the idea when he was newly divorced and tired of being pushed to start dating again. 

"Around Thanksgiving, my mom called me and asked if she should set an extra place for someone I’m bringing,” he recalled on the app's website.

Rain check? While users are able to make plans with their boyfriends, the date is obviously never going to happen

'In that moment I realized how great it would be to have an answer for her that didn't require me to actually be dating someone.'

Even if you are currently dating, the Invisible Boyfriend and Girlfriend apps allow you to work on your texting skills by having you interact with another human.

And if the person you are with isn't ready to commit? You can easily invent a person who is trying to steal you away.

In the technological age, there seems to be an app for all of your romantic needs.

In 2012, conflicted women were able to download the Should I Break Up With My Boyfriend? app in order to figure out if they should stay with their partner or end their relationships.

Coincidentally, the following year saw the creation of BreakUpText, an app that offers multiple options for users to end their relationships electronically with little to no fuss. 

And then 2014 was the year of the BroApp.

Lazy men around the world rejoiced when they learned of the electronic tool that pre-programs and sends text message to women, so they will feel adequately adored.
