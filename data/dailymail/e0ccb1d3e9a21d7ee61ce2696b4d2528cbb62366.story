The economy is springing back to life and there are ‘good reasons to suppose a gentle recovery is under way’, the governor of the Bank of England said last night.

Sir Mervyn King also said there was ‘no reason’ why State-backed Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds could not be largely sold back to the private sector ‘within a relatively short period’.

Delivering his most upbeat speech since the financial crisis, Sir Mervyn outlined a set of policies which he said could ‘roll back the dark cloud of uncertainty’ hanging over the economy.

Recovering: Sir Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, said there are 'good reasons' for optimism regarding the recovery of the British economy

These include fixing Britain’s troubled banks, and cutting taxes and red tape to help businesses.

Lloyds and RBS were bailed out with £66billion of taxpayers’ money during the financial crisis in 2008 but Chancellor George Osborne would like to return the banks to the private sector before the election in 2015. His aim is to achieve a large enough profit to fund tax cuts for millions but the Tories have recently started to downplay expectations, claiming that Labour ‘paid too much’ for the banks.

 

Sir Mervyn told a business audience in Belfast: ‘I believe we can roll back the cloud of uncertainty darkening the outlook for demand, allow the rays of optimism to peer through, and sustain a recovery based on a successful rebalancing of the UK economy.’

He steered clear of the term ‘green shoots’, notoriously used by the then Chancellor Norman Lamont during the recession in 1991.

But he said: ‘There are good reasons to suppose that a gentle recovery is under way.’

Back to private: Sir Mervyn added there is no reason why banks bailed out by the state, such as Royal Bank of Scotland, could not be sold back to the private sector within a short period

These, he said, included falling mortgage rates, rising share prices, and companies having a large amount of cash at their disposal to spend on expanding their business. There is also more cash swilling around the financial system.

Britain's coveted credit rating was hanging by a thread last night as the country sank deeper into the red.

Official figures showed the Government borrowed £15.4billion last month, up from £14.8billion a year earlier, fuelling fears that Britain will be stripped of its gold-plated AAA credit rating.

In further bad news for Chancellor George Osborne, figures on Friday are expected to show the economy contracted again in the final three months of last year, leaving the country on the brink of a triple-dip recession.

James Knightley, an economist at banking group ING, said: ‘The question is how long the UK can hold on to its AAA status.’ 

The Government borrowed £106.5billion from April to December, the Office for National Statistics revealed – £7.2billion, or 7.3 per cent, more than at the same stage of the previous year.

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘These figures underline what the Chancellor said at the Autumn Statement: it’s taking time, but the economy is healing.’ 

Shadow Treasury minister Rachel Reeves said: ‘George Osborne’s economic plan is hurting, but not working. We urgently need a change of course.’

The comments come as the number of first-time buyers reached its highest level since before the financial crisis, with around 220,000 sales last year, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders.

Figures from HM Revenue & Customs showed there were 932,000 house sales last year in total – a 5 per cent increase on 2011, but still half the level seen five years earlier. 

The FTSE 100 index of Britain’s biggest companies smashed through the 6,000 barrier just before Christmas, having soared by more than a quarter since the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008.

The upbeat comments from the notoriously pessimistic governor come despite growing fears of a triple-dip recession. Figures published on Friday may show the economy shrank in the final three months of 2012 after the briefest of recoveries between July and September.

But last night Sir Mervyn argued these figures ‘tell us little about the underlying health of the economy’, as they are affected by one-off factors such as the Diamond Jubilee and the Olympics.

He conceded that ‘living standards have been squeezed for longer than at any time in living memory’.

But he said the flagship Funding for Lending Scheme should make it easier for cash-strapped businesses and households to get cheaper loans.

The scheme, launched in August by the Government and the Bank of England, provides banks with cheap money if they lend more to the economy. Sir Mervyn also made it clear the Bank was ready to print more money through quantitative easing in a bid to stimulate growth. He said: ‘Be in no doubt that we are ready to provide more stimulus if it is needed.’
