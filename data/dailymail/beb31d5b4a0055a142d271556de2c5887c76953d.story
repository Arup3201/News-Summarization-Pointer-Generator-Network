This extraordinary panoramic view shows the Pope waving to the faithful as he arrived in St Peter's Square for his final general audience at the Vatican.

Pope Benedict XVI, who is the first Pope to retire since 1415, attended his last weekly public audience today before stepping down tomorrow.

The Pontiff has been the leader of the Catholic Church for eight years but has cited ailing health as the reason for his retirement.

Around 150,000 people flooded the square for his last general audience, eager to show their 
support and bear witness to the end of the papacy.

Benedict clearly enjoyed the occasion,
taking a long victory lap around the square and stopping to kiss and 
bless half a dozen babies and infants.

Seventy cardinals, some tearful, sat in solemn attendance - then gave him a standing ovation at the end of his speech.

Benedict then made a quick exit, 
foregoing the typical meet-and-greet session that follows the audience 
as if to not prolong the goodbye.

Given the historic moment, he also eschewed his typical professorial Wednesday catechism lesson and 
instead gave a personal, heartfelt final address.

He explained once again why he was retiring but assuring his flock of 1.2billion that he was not abandoning them.

‘To love the church means also to have
the courage to take difficult, painful decisions, always keeping the 
good of the church in mind,’ Benedict said.

He insisted a pontiff has no privacy as a pope, nor in his future role as emeritus pope: ‘He belongs
always and forever to everyone, to the whole church.’
