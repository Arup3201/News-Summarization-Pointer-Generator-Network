A woman's skin was burning and appeared to be melting off as she ran out from her father's Brooklyn apartment Saturday afternoon after doused her in a household acid.

The wheelchair-bound Jerome Lynch, 69, later admitted to police that he was the one to throw a cup full of drain cleaner onto his 50-year-old daughter Darlene.

'You could see the smoke coming off her body,' neighbor Clarissa Shakespeare told The New York Daily News.

'Everyone was just traumatized and scared. Her skin looked like melting wax. And then her whole eye lid was melted. The whole left side from her face all the way down to her feet.'

Scene: Neighbors called for help after they saw Darlene run out of her father's ground floor apartment in this building on Schenck Avenue in Brooklyn on Saturday afternoon after being doused in drain cleaner

Single mother Darlene, whose son is serving overseas in the military, was treated by paramedics when they arrived to help the burning woman when witnesses called for help after seeing her run out to Schenck Avenue around 1.40pm Saturday.

She is still being treated for her extensive burns, and while she is expected to live, there is a chance that she will lose her left eye because of the damage from the attack.

Dangerous: Jerome Lynch threw a cup of undiluted drain cleaner on his daughter, 98 per cent of which was sulfuric acid

'She was hollering. I heard the screaming and I just saw her there peeling. One side was peeled off and everyone took her clothes off and was pouring water on her,' witness Lisa Jones told The Daily News.

A niece spoke to Jerome, who has been in a wheelchair for the past two years after having a stroke, and he acknowledged that he knew he was going to be arrested. He now faces assault charges.

Police cuffed him to his chair when they took him away and he proceeded to admit to the attack at the station after writing a confession by note because his speech suffered in the stroke.

Family members said that they do not believe Darlene would have abused her father, and say that he has become delusional recently.

On the day of the attack, Darlene had come to his apartment because he told her he needed food.

During the visit, she was resting on a couch in his ground-floor apartment when he went into the kitchen and returned with a cup full of what she thought was water.

Instead, it was El Diable drain cleanser, which is 98 per cent sulfuric acid.

While some relatives are shocked, saying such an attack seems out of place with his 'jovial' nature, neighbors recall a more sinister side.

Ms Shakespeare said that he would keep to himself and has been known to pour bleach and ammonia down the hallway of his apartment building to keep children from playing there.
