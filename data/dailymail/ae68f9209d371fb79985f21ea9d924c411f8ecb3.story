Predator: Alberto Flores Ramirez, 36, was charged with rape after luring a woman to a California motel room to perform a raw egg cleanse

A spiritual healer has been charged with rape and sexual assault after luring a woman to a motel room to perform a raw egg cleanse treatment.

Alberto Flores Ramirez, 36, allegedly met his victim through a chat and dating website.

Ramirez, of Santa Clemente, California, embarked on an online relationship with the 33-year-old woman from Mexico who is in the U.S. on a tourist visa with her son.

Her two daughters remained in Mexico with a man who is not her husband but has custody of the children.

Santa Ana police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna told MailOnline that Ramirez had convinced the woman he could 'spiritually cleanse her', making it possible for her two girls to come to America. 

After chatting to Ramirez on the website Badoo, she agreed to meet him at a McDonald's restaurant in Santa Ana on April 3.

They then drove to the Aloha Motel around 6pm to begin the treatment - a healing art which cleanses a person's spiritual aura by running an egg over the body to release negative energies.

Egg cleansing is common throughout central and south America, but is not widely known in the U.S.

After performing the cleanse once, Ramirez told the victim she still had 'bad vibes' and to remove her clothes.

He then reportedly rubbed raw eggs on the victim’s body and fondled her, according to a report by the District Attorney's office.

When the victim attempted to cover herself with the comforter from the bed, Ramirez is accused of jumping on top of the victim and restraining her. He then raped the woman and threatened her life.

After she escaped, she contacted police and took part in a sting to catch Ramirez - who is believed to be in the U.S. illegally.

Cultural practice: Although it is not widely known in the U.S., the raw egg cleanse is commonly used as a spiritual healing treatment in Latin America

He was lured to a meeting point after text messages were sent by the woman and detectives were able to make an arrest.

Ramirez has been charged with one 
felony count each of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, and sexual
penetration with foreign object by force. If convicted, he faces a 
maximum sentence of 12 years in state prison.

Ramirez is being held on $100,000 bail and was expected to be arraigned today at 3pm local time.
