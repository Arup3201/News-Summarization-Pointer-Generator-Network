Apple is set to release the latest version of its Mac software to a million users tomorrow, as part of its biggest ever test program.

The Yosemite software will eventually allow users to make and receive calls and notifications from their Mac - even if the phone is in another room.

The software has also been overhauled with a new 'flat' look, and can search the web without having to open a browser.

Apple's Federighi (pictured) unveiled the radical overhaul of Apple's Mac software, called Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite earlier this year. The firm is making it available to users tomorrow in a special 'preview' version

Apple is set to release the test version of Yosemite tomorrow, but will limit users to a million, it said.

Users can visit apple.com to sign up - and user's machines will then be updated to the final, free version of the software when it is released later this year.

However, the firm did warn that Yosemite is still 'beta' software.

The software is the first to be overseen by Apple's Sir Jonathan Ive, who was recently given responsibility for the design of both hardware and software at Apple.

The software was first revealed at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference in San Francisco.

During the Mac OS announcement, Apple's 
Federighi joked that OS X Weed was one of the names considered, before 
revealing the latest version of the software will be called Yosemite.

It is available in an unprecedented public beta which begins tomorrow.

The
 software has been redesigned to look ‘flat’- to resemble the latest 
version of the iOS software seen on iPhones and iPads.

It
 also has a new mode that lets users easily change the colour scheme, 
and comes with a new online storage service called iCloud Drive, 
allowing users to automatically synchronise files across multiple Macs, 
iPhones, iPads and even Windows PCs.

The first thing that strikes you about Yosemite is that there is less to look at.

Gones are the bells and whistles, the fake leather and other distractions of previous versions.

Instead, what you have is, without doubt, the best looking operating system ever seen.

Apple's obsession with detail is clear, and when combined with high high resolution retina display of the firm's latest laptops, the difference is incredibly obvious.

Even the tiny details, such as a new font Apple designed, give everything a crisp, uncluttered feel.

Menus also now have a transparent feel, giving the system an almost glass-like feel as you move windows around.

Yosemite now has a similar notification screen to the iPad and iPhone

Although iOS 8 is not yet available so we were unable to try out the call and 'handoff' features, the new notification centre on screen gives a real sense that the iPhone, iPad and Mac are now one system, system than three separate gadgets.

Notifications can carry over from your iPhone, and the 'today' view mimics that iPhone users are used to.

Also surprisingly useful are the upgrades to Spotlight, the Mac's search system.

Searching now shows you information from Wikipedia pages, and you can even search the web without having to open a seperate browser window - although it does Bing rather than Google.

you can also do basic sums, and even currency conversions form the spotlight window, and even show you cinema times if you search for a film - a real timesaver.

The spotlight search system is also far smarter - for instance, search for movies, and it will show you what's on at the local cinema

The mail app has also been updated, with a new 'markup' feature that lets you easily draw on images - which is great fun to play with.

Surprisingly for what is still a test piece of software, Yosemite also feels incredibly fast and snappy.

While it is still officially 'beta' software, once you've tried Yosemite, going back to the previous version is hard - as well as being the best looking OS we've ever seen, Yosemite really does give a glimpse into the future of Apple, where all your devices work together seamlessly - as long at they are made by Apple.

The
 software update will improve battery life, according to Apple, and 
it has added a new ‘markup’ option to let users easily annotate pictures
 they are emailing.

The firm has also improved the way Macs, iPads and iPhone work together.

For example, a new feature called Continuity lets people drop files onto their phone from a Mac, while Handoff lets people swap between devices and automatically pick up where the user left off - even if an email is half written.

Elsewhere, Yosemite now has SMS and phone call support to Macs, meaning people can send texts from their Mac, and even use it as a speakerphone - although this is not available in the test version as iOS8 has not yet been released.

The new Yosemite software will be made available to a million users tomorrow as part of Apple's biggest ever test of its Mac software. The final version, which users of the trial version can upgrade to for free, will be available later this year

 example, a feature called Continuity lets people drop files onto 
their phone from a Mac, while Handoff lets people swap between devices 
and automatically pick up where the user left off - even if an email is 
half written.

Elsewhere, 
Yosemite now has SMS and phone call support to Macs, meaning people can 
send texts from their Mac, and even use it as a speakerphone.

Apple boss Tim Cook said the firm’s software had been completely redesigned to work ‘seamlessly’ together.

Although the preview release of Yosemite will not support these features as iOS 8 has yet to be released, the final version will be able to:

Make and receive callsWhen you receive a call on your iPhone, you can now answer it on your Mac, using the built-in speakers and mics as a speakerphone. you can also click a phone number anywhere in OS X to make a call through your iPhone.

Send and receive SMSThe Mac can now send and receive SMS and MMS text messages through your iPhone. 

HandoffThis useful feature allows you to start an activity on one device—and pick it on another. If you start writing an email on your iPhone and want to finish it on your Mac, your iPhone hands it to your Mac with the cursor in the same location.

The new software allows you make and receive calls using your iPhone from a Mac - even if your phone is in another room

Speaking to 5,000 developers at the California's Moscone centre,  earlier this year, Cook said: 'While the industry declined by 5 per cent, Macs grew by 12 per cent.'

Cook also took aim at Microsoft’s poorly received Windows 8 software.

'Over 50 per cent of our users are on the latest release. Windows 8 shipped a year before Mavericks, and it’s at 14 per cent.

Earlier this year, Cook announced Apple is gearing up to 'enter new product categories'.

While
 the recent $3billion acquisition of Beats Audio from rapper Dr Dre 
suggests the company is potentially exploring new territories.
