The 17-year-old CSI student who has been accused of brutally murdering and dismembering schoolgirl Jessica Ridgeway was a goth who wore black and was 'infatuated' with death, it was revealed today.

Austin Reed Sigg was arrested late on Tuesday night at his home near Ketner Lake Open Space after his mother tipped off police. He is due back in court today.

Sigg will be charged with two counts of murder in the first degree and second-degree kidnapping as well as two counts of criminal attempts. He allegedly confessed to the murder to his mother.

The accused killer enjoyed forensic science and won second place in a Crime Scene Investigation competition. Some friends told the media that Sigg expressed interest in becoming a mortician.

Alleged killer: Austin Reed Sigg, 17, was arrested late Tuesday night after Westminster police received a tip that led them to a home near Ketner Lake Open Space

He will also face charges for the attempted abduction of a female jogger near Ketner Lake on May 28.

On March 23, he won second place in the Crime Scene Investigation division of the Health Occupation Students of America State Leadership Conference competition, according to The Denver Post.

'He was so infatuated with the idea of death,' Hannah Bane, a college classmate, told a local reporter.

Brooke Olds, who has known Sigg for about nine years, told The Denver Channel: 'He was very quiet, shy and to himself. I would say he was gothic,'

Though he often complained about school, was interested in mortuary science and was taking forensics classes, said Rachel Bradley, 17, who attended Standley Lake with him.

Arapahoe Community College offers the state's only accredited mortuary science program.

'He never really talked about his family or his friends. Like, all he talked about was playing or spending time with us. He always wanted, just, to play capture the flag.'

Another student Dakota Foster, 19, said he didn't know Sigg well, but revealed 'he used to hang out with a lot of us in what we called the goth corner (of the school cafeteria), where all the metal heads were'.

The teen was arrested at his home at around 7.45pm on Tuesday and Jessica's parents were notified by Westminster police this morning.

Speaking after his arrest his mother confirmed she was the one who tipped off police.

'I made the phone call, and he turned himself in. That's all I have to say,' said Mindy Sigg, before she broke down in tears.

Sigg's parents are divorced.

The father had been arrested many times, local television stations said -- accused of domestic violence, assault and bank fraud.

'This morning the Ridgeway family was notified of this arrest,' Westminster Police Chief Lee Birk said in a lunchtime press conference.

From missing to murdered: The Colorado 
schoolgirl's gruesomely dismembered body was discovered in a park 10 
miles from her home on October 11, six days after she vanished on her 
way to school

'We hope and pray this arrest gives them some measure of closure in dealing with their horrible loss and tragedy.'

The boy's mother said she called 
police but Sigg handed himself over to officers. A woman identifying 
herself as his aunt said his mother alerted authorities after the Sigg 
came to her with some 'disturbing information.'

A police report said Sigg was 
'cooperative' when police arrived at his house and was taken to 
Westminster police department in handcuffs. He was later taken to 
Mountain View Detention Facility.

Authorities
said they could not release much information because Sigg is a juvenile
and the affidavits in the case have been sealed under court order.

Police were today blocking access to 
Sigg's home, which his just 1.4 miles from Jessica's, and a search 
warrant had been served on the property, according to The Post.

Investigators were also digging through the contents of a dumpster across the street from the Sigg residence and police towed away a bronze Jeep that belonged to the suspect.

Jessica's great-grandmother said she was thrilled police had made an arrest.

'Grateful to God that the community 
pulled together and the police department didnâ€™t quit,' said Donna Moss 
told The Denver Channel.

The teen will make his first court appearance at 8am tomorrow in Jefferson County.

'We
worked on this case nonstop, around the clock, since October 5, the day
of her abduction,' Birk said. 'I believe we've made a significant step 
towards justice for Jessica.

'We
hope also that knowing an arrest has been made in this case can cause 
our community to rest a little easier and maybe feel a little safer.'

Police
revealed earlier this week the suspect in the attempted abduction was 
thought to be the same man who kidnapped and murdered Jessica on October
5.

They have not revealed why they think the two cases are linked.

The Colorado schoolgirl's dismembered body was found six days after she vanished on her way to school.

In the abduction attempt, an 
unidentified young woman was jogging around a lake about a 
half-mile from the Ridgeway home when she was grabbed from behind by a man.

The 
attacker tried to cover her mouth with a chemical-soaked rag but she was
able to escape.

According to The Post, the woman described her attacker as a 
light-skinned Caucasian male between 18 and 30 years of age, 5 feet 6 to
5 feet 8 inches tall with a medium build and brown hair.

The link between the two cases was confirmed just days after police found a tuft of blonde hair a mile away 
from where 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway's body was discovered.

After police were alerted to the 
scene, a grid search was conducted 
while the hair was taken into evidence.

But Westminster police 
investigating the murder initially dismissed claims that the hair was a 
definite clue in the case.

A spokesman told the Denver Post last 
week that there was nothing to suggest the hair has anything to do with 
Jessica or was even human.

Another recent clue in the tragic 
investigation was a wooden
cross which police believe belonged to Jessica's killer, describing it as a 'pivotal piece of evidence' in the case.

Pictures of the cross, which is 1.5 
inches tall by 1 inch wide cross and has a hole at the top so it can be worn as a
necklace, were released by Westminster Police Department on Friday.

Hope gone: After the grisly discovery of Jessica's body on October 11, the search for Jessica turned into a hunt for her killer

Recent clue: Pictures of the cross, which is 1.5
inch tall by 1 inch wide with a hole at the top so it can be worn as a 
necklace, were released by Westminster Police Department on Friday

'Authorities are looking for someone 
who may carry or wear this type of cross, may have recently purchased 
one of these, or is known to have some association with one,' 
Westminster Police Department Mr Trevor Materasso said in a statement at the time.

Police were also looking for local businesses that may sell these types of crosses.

The solid wood pendant has three 
vertical markings etched into the horizontal bar of the cross and a 
zig-zag pattern carved into the opposite side.

Mr Materasso added that the item 'could become a pivotal piece of evidence that helps authorities identify and locate Jessica's killer.'

Jessica was last seen beginning a 
short walk from her home to Witt Elementary School on the morning of 
October 5. She never arrived.

A search by hundreds of law officers 
did not start until hours later because Jessica's mother works nights 
and slept through a call from school officials saying Jessica wasn't 
there.

Then, on October 7, Jessica's backpack was found on a sidewalk in Superior, some 6 miles northwest of her Westminster home.

At about 5pm on Wednesday October 10, 
dozens of officers flooded into Pattridge Park in Arvada, combing the 
foot of a hill, walking no more than five feet apart, reportedly working
on a credible tip.

The focus of their search was an 
abandoned cabin that appeared to have been part of a former mining 
operation. The area is now a popular park where neighbors often come to 
hike, ride bicycles and fly model airplanes.

Police said they did not suspect Jessica's parents, who are divorced and fighting a custody battle 
over her, had any involvement in the disappearance.

The U.S. Marshals Service, immigration
officials and state Department of Corrections have been reviewing registered
sex offenders in the area.

During the heartbreaking investigation, authorities have received more than 
1,500 tips from the public, searched more than 500
homes and gone through over 1,000 vehicles hunting for clues.
