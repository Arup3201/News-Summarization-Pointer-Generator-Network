A shop worker forced to dump her car in Devon when flood waters made roads impassable returned to find a £50 parking ticket slapped to her windscreen.

Mandy O'Donnell, 55, of Sidbury, was driving home from work at a Co-operative shop in torrential rain when rising flood waters stopped her in her tracks.

Mrs O'Donnell quickly parked up in a council-run car park - intending to come back when conditions were safer - but was outraged to discover the fine when she returned less than two hours later.

Disbelief: Mandy O'Donnell was stunned to find the penalty charge on her windscreen after rising flood waters forced her to ditch her car in Devon

She has now had an appeal against the penalty rejected.

'I just couldn't believe it,' she said. 'There was no way I could get home. I thought I was doing the right thing by parking it up somewhere out of the way and coming back when it was safer.'

Mrs O'Donnell tried alternative routes to get home from her early morning shift at the Co-op store in Sidmouth on July 7, driving through Manstone and making it as far as Sidford before finally admitting defeat and parking up her Vauxhall Corsa.

'I didn't have any money with me because I'd been at work and you're not allowed to carry cash,' she said. 'So I couldn't buy a ticket.

'I thought that because of the flooding I'd be okay there for a couple of hours.'

Torrential: The flash floods that forced Mrs O'Donnell to abandon her car also saw the River Exe burst its banks, as Devon was hit by a deluge of heavy rain

But a passing traffic warden evidently chose not to take the weather conditions into consideration, and duly issued Mrs O'Donnell with the £50 fine.

The shop worker had parked up at around 10.45am on the day of the flooding.

She was offered a lift by a woman in a 4x4 and walked back to her car less than two hours later, by which time flood waters had receded.

Mrs O'Donnell appealed to East Devon District Council, but the local authority upheld the fine.

She was told: 'After careful consideration of the circumstances, we have found no grounds for cancellation of the charge.'
