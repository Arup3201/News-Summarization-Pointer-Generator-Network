From scrambling for a passport at the airport, to checking the safety of your wallet on a busy street, plucking items out of a stuffed backpack can be a pain.

But now man hopes to change the way we use them by creating a rucksack, named the Wolffepack, that lets people reach into their bag without the hassle of un-strapping and taking it off.

A cord system is used to swing the pack from a wearer’s back round to their front – and back again – without moving the shoulder straps.

One former engineer hopes to change the way we use backpacks by creating one that allows people to reach their things without the hassle of un-strapping and taking the bag off (pictured) 

David Wolffe, an engineering graduate from the University of Cambridge, says that his wolffepack can also be easily worn on the front in crowded spaces, such as trains, or areas where wearers want to keep an eye on their valuables.

It contains an ‘orbital trapeze’ technology called expetoSYSTEM which is built into the backpack.

A user can tug downwards on a strap attached to the conventional shoulder strap of the bag to release the main part of the backpack and swing it round to their front.

Once the user has got what they wanted from their bag, they pull the strap again to return it to position.

Mr Wolffe, 51, who lives in London, quit his job of Finance Director to develop the backpack and is now raising money on Kickstarter to put it into production.

He has already made working prototypes and has manufacturing partners in place to make the product, if he raises £30,000 ($48,206).

The bag is available to pre-order from £85 ($137) plus shipping from the crowd funding website and is set to be dispatched in May next year.

‘For years I’ve watched people take their backpacks off time and again to get something out, to move it out of the way on a crowded train or because they’re worried about security,’ he said.

‘I knew there had to be a better way. With the help of an extraordinary team we’ve perfected the design of the wolffepack backpack.’

The bag comes in two designs – one for commuters and a more rugged, outdoor design.

They both have padded pockets inside for a laptop and tablet as well as others for chargers and smartphones, plus a separate organiser for pens, keys.

They are designed to be comfortable and has padding on the back as well as an airflow channel to keep the wearer cool.
