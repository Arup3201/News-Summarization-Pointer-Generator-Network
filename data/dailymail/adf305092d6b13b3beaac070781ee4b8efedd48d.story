A mother has been jailed after locking her four-year-old daughter in her room for three hours so she could go into town 'to be by herself'.

Sophie Ritson, 21, was jailed for 150 days after she admitted neglecting and abandoning her daughter on July 25.

North Cumbria Magistrates' Court heard that worried neighbours raised the alarm after hearing the little girl pleading for food and drink and shouting that she wanted to get out.

Police were called to rescue the youngster after she was left in a bedroom for more than three hours while her mum went into Carlisle city centre.

Diane Jackson, prosecuting, told how officers found that the little girl's potty was nearly full and the room was sparsely decorated with bare floorboards exposed.

The court was told that a neighbour heard the girl shouting 'I want to come out' from an upstairs room and later 'I'm hungry. I need a drink'.

Another neighbour said she spotted Ritson, of  Carlisle, Cumbria, with her partner in the city centre at about 1pm.

The police were called and officers managed to open the kitchen window in an attempt to rescue the girl before Ritson finally returned home at around 4pm.

When asked by police officers why she had left her daughter, Ritson said that she 'needed to be by herself'. 

She also claimed that, before she left the house, her daughter was given a drink and she had locked her door for the child's own safety.

She added: 'I don't know what I was thinking. Her attitude stinks. She is crying all the time,' the court heard.

Ritson is allowed to be named after a court order banning publication of her identity was successfully challenged.

Laura Harper, defending, said her client had received a lack of support since having her daughter.

'Sophie doesn't attempt to minimise what she did that day. She didn't feel as though she could go to anyone to talk to about child problems,' she said.

Sentencing, District Judge Gerald Chalk condemned what the mother had done. He said: 'I take the view that this is so serious that custody is my only option.

'Parents know the pleasure of having children but also the commitment of looking after that child properly. But you chose to abandon her for several hours.'
