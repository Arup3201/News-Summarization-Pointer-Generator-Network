Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew has called on fans to use social media to name and shame anyone caught throwing coins following incidents during the club's last two home games against Newcastle and Liverpool.  

The Eagles will upgrade their security measures this weekend for the visit of Arsenal in the hope that they can put a halt to the incidents seen in the last fortnight.

As well as more cameras situated around the ground, some stewards will wear body cameras in attempt to get a clearer view of potential culprits.

Crystal Palace have vowed to ban anyone found guilty of throwing coins from the ground for life 

Coloccini played the full 90 minutes in the 1-1 draw but John Carver raged he could have been blinded

And Pardew insists that fans should upload pictures of rule-breakers to social media.

'The incident with Chelsea in Paris gives you the strength of social media. So if any fans are next to someone [behaving inappropriately] then film them. Let's have a picture of them and we'll try and do our best to find them.

'We represent society at all levels, we get all types of our society here and we can't control their behaviour to a degree.

'All we can do is put on the best environment and most children-friendly environment we possibly can. We've got the best atmosphere in the country and we don't want to lose that with silly little incidents that have come, and I don't want to keep going on about it.

'Those few citizens that are letting us down, we need to reel them in and point them out to us.'

The south London club have launched investigations in two separate incidents of objects being thrown onto the pitch.

The first saw Newcastle defender Fabricio Collocini hit with a coin during the 1-1 draw last week as the Magpies celebrated going ahead, the second occurred after Daniel Sturridge equalised for Liverpool in last Saturday's FA Cup tie.

And the Eagles have invested in upgrading their CCTV equipment following the incidents that marred both matches ahead of Saturday's visit of Arsenal.

The club are also exploring tactical security measures they can take when opposition scores to prevent further incidents.
