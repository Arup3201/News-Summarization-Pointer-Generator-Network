New York City is owed over $16 million in unpaid parking tickets issued to foreign diplomatic vehicles.

Egypt is by far the worst offender owing a staggering $2 million in outstanding debt alone as of this summer, topping the list of more than 180 countries.

Five countries owe more than $500,000 - Nigeria, Indonesia, Brazil, Morocco and Pakistan - according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.

Gotcha: A New York City traffic warden issues a ticket. The diplomatic community owe an incredible $16million in unpaid fines

As home to the UN headquarters in Manhattan as well as dozens of foreign consulates, New York City issues special license plates to the members of diplomatic community.

While they are technically required to pay the fines, the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations means they are protected from prosecution.

The vast majority of the outstanding debt, 
some $15.6 million, comes from tickets issued before 2002, when the city
 launched a successful drive to stamp out parking violations.

A spokesman for the Egypt's UN Mission said he was unable to discuss the matter.

When asked about the $894,000 in unpaid tickets owed by the NIgerian government, Tope Ade Elias-Fatile, senior counsellor and head of media at the country's mission to the U.N., told the Wall Street Journal: 'I don't know why I should be the one to talk.'

The tiny South Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, owes the least amount - a paltry $30.
