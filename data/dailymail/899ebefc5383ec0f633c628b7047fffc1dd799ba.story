If you dug these up in your garden, you probably wouldn’t think twice about throwing them away.

But the unassuming objects are 4,000-year-old Bronze Age beads, and worth their weight in gold.

Unearthed from a prehistoric burial chest on Dartmoor, they have been heralded as one of the most significant historical finds in more than a century.

The beads are part of a range of Bronze Age artefacts found in Dartmoor that have been heralded as one of the most significant finds of the past 100 years

The chest’s well-preserved contents included human bones, teeth, textiles and intricate jewellery.

Bronze Age expert Dr Ben Roberts, from Durham University, said that the find was a ‘seven or eight out of ten’ on a scale where the ruins of Pompeii get a ten.

Jane Marchand, senior archaeologist from Dartmoor National Park, described the haul as one of the most important discoveries since the 19th century.

She said: ‘This is an incredible find. We had no idea we could end up with something as astounding as human remains.

‘The amber beads probably came from the Baltic – and meant they were long-distance trading 4,000 years ago.

‘These artefacts show Dartmoor wasn’t the isolated, hard-to-reach place we thought it was. This mystery is unfolding.

'This has been fascinating to work on, but it’s just one piece in a puzzle. The story is only part-told.'

The archaeologists, who were funded by 
English Heritage, had simply hoped that the chest would offer some clues
 about the environment of times past.

But its exceptionally well-preserved contents, including human bones, 
teeth, a basket and around 200 beads, may contain a wealth of 
information about life at the time.

Mrs Marchand said: ‘We lifted the cist lid and saw some red fur with 
bits of bone sticking out. We thought a fox might have died there.

‘But then a little black bead fell out and we realised it was something 
much more interesting.

'And it looked like the fur had been wrapped 
around some remains, lying on the granite base of the cist. We wrapped it in cling film and took it to the laboratory.’

The number of beads is particularly exciting.

As well as the amber beads, human remains and a woven basket or bag were found preserved in peat

Mrs Marchand said: ‘Their presence could mean it was a high-status burial that you’d normally see in Wessex or Orkney.

‘There were a number of amber beads which probably came from the Baltic -
 and that must have meant they were doing long-distance trading 4,000 
years ago.’

The cist, measuring roughly 30in wide by 60in long, also contained a 
band of leather complete with tassels, believed to be some sort of 
clothing item.

Some wooden jewellery, believed to be ear studs, was also discovered.

The findings follow the announcement by scientists at the University of 
Leicester this month that the skeleton exhumed in September last year 
during an archaeological dig in a car park is that of King Richard III.

Mrs Marchand said: ‘It is a very exciting time for archaeology.

‘We don’t yet know the age or the sex of the person whose remains have 
been found, and we may not. But this mystery is unfolding.

‘To be a part of it has been truly amazing.’

The chest, which will be featured on BBC South West’s regional TV programme Inside Out, also contained a decorated leather band and a woven basket.
