Ex-Fashion Police writers have revealed that many industry insiders believed the demise of the popular E! series was inevitable after the death of the show's former host Joan Rivers, because its current stars can't unapologetically get away with the comedian's no holds barred brand of humor.

While many blame the show's recent hiatus - and the abrupt departures of Kathy Griffin and Kelly Osbourne - on the scandal that erupted after Giuliana Rancic joked that Zendaya Coleman's dreadlocks at the Oscars made her look like she smelled of 'patchouli oil' and 'weed', others say Fashion Police was always destined to fail without the legendary comedian. 

'Joan isn't there to make it all work,' Todd Masterson, a former Fashion Police writer told Cosmopolitan.com during a phone conversation. 'She had decades of saying the most offensive things under her belt. Now the pressure was on everyone else to make provocative jokes.'

Original star: Joan Rivers sat poised in her chair during a taping of Fashion Police 

Old friends: Tony Tripoli, the former head writer of Fashion Police, can be seen showing the late Joan Rivers something on his phone during a break on set in 2014  

Industry insiders: Tony (L) and former Fashion Police writer Todd Masterson (R) weighed in on the future of the show after it was announced that the series will be on hiatus until September 

Mr Masterson, who left the series in 2013 to go on strike with a majority of the show's writers, said that he remembers Giuliana would often read from teleprompters, noting that the controversial comment was mostly likely reviewed by multiple people and passed through video editing before it found its way on air.

Tony Tripoli, former head writer of Fashion Police, also came to Giuliana's defense. 

'Giuliana was probably exhausted after spending 12 hours on the red carpet and getting very little sleep,' he said. 'I don't think she meant to sound racist or cause anyone harm.'

The 40-year-old red carpet interviewer inevitably apologized for the ill-advised and racially loaded joke - which is something both writers insist Joan would never have done.

‘That was her act,’ Mr Masterson said of Joan. 'I think she knew an apology was a floodgate.' 

Happier times: Brad Goreski, Kelly Osbourne, Kathy Griffin and Giuliana Rancic only filmed seven episodes of Fashion Police together

Controversial comment: Giuliana came under fire last month after she said that Zendaya Coleman's dreadlocks at the Oscars made her look like she smelled of 'patchouli oil' and 'weed' during an episode of the show

Truly offended: Zendaya, who can be seen posing at this year's Oscars, slammed Giuliana for her 'outrageously offensive' comment. She later accepted Giuliana's apology

Kelly Osbourne, who is friends with Zendaya, was the first to quit the show last month after five years with show.

Then Kathy announced her exit last week on Twitter after hosting only seven episodes of the show.

While she maintained that making fun of women's bodies was against what she believed in as a feminist, TMZ claimed that producers were discussing firing her from the show.

On Tuesday, E! announced that the show would be on hiatus until September, cancelling three episodes in the meantime. 

'We look forward to taking this opportunity to refresh the show before the next awards season,' the network said in a statement.

'Our talented co-hosts Giuliana Rancic and Brad Goreski, along with executive producer Melissa Rivers, will continue their roles as we evolve the show into its next chapter for the legions of fans around the world.' 

Mr Tripoli, who is currently working on and upcoming E! talk show about plastic surgery called Good Work, told Cosmopolitan.com: 'Joan would absolutely want the show to continue.'
