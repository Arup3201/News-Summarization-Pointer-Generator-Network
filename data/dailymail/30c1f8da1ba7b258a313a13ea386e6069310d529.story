The pilots of an international flight forgot to lower the landing gear and had to abort touch-down at just 500ft because the captain was distracted by his mobile phone, air safety investigators have found.

Australian Jetstar flight JQ57 was making its approach to Singapore's Changi International Airport on May 27, 2010 and was less than 2,500 feet above the tarmac when the captain's mobile phone messaging alert sounded.

The first officer twice tried to get the captain's attention to set a 'missed-approach altitude' and when he looked over noticed the 'captain was preoccupied with his mobile phone,' an official report into the incident said.

Blunder: The pilots of an Australian Jetstar passenger jet like this one were forced to abort a landing the because the captain got distracted by his mobile phone

The captain, who had more than 13,400 hours' flying experience, said he was in the process of unlocking and turning off his mobile phone and had not noticed his first officer's request.

It wasn't until the plane was at 700ft that the first officer realised the landing gear was not down.

But when the Airbus A321 dipped below 500ft with the landing gear still being deployed, the Ground Proximity Warning System alarm sounded and the pilots aborted the landing.

Now the Australian Transport Safety Board has found the pilots had failed to perform a number of tasks to prepare for landing including lowering the landing gear, completing the landing checklist, selecting auto break and checking the flight parameters.

A man who threatened the crew on an all-night Qantas flight across Australia had to be restrained by other passengers after a stewardess cried for help.

Women wept and passengers grew concerned as the man walked through the aisle of the jet shouting abuse and threatening staff and the pilots.

When he attacked another male passenger, a stewardess cried out: 'Please help! Please help!'Â 

Other passengers jumped up to her aid, tackled the man and held him down as crew members tied his hands behind his back.

The drama occurred on QF648 after it had taken off from Perth on Wednesday night for the four-hour flight to Melbourne.

'I don't know what was wrong with him. He was threatening staff, he was threatening the pilot - it was pretty scary stuff,' a passenger who gave his name as Rob told Radio Triple M.

A Qantas spokesman said he could not confirm why the man had to be restrained.

Jetstar pilots are bound by the same rules as passengers when it comes to mobile phones and they should be switched off during take off and landing and only used in 'flight mode' when at altitude.

Safety investigators said phone records showed the captain did not send or answer any text messages during the approach.

The use of the mobile phone was just one of several distractions that led to the missed landing, the report said.

The pilots' attention was also broken by a request to slow the aircraft earlier than anticipated, a discussion by the crew of the Singapore skyline and a late detection of an auto pilot-related warning light.

Despite the near miss, the Transport Safety Board made no findings against Jetstar or its procedures.

The airline said it had made the flight a case study in its training manual and had added an item to pilots take-off checklist reminding them to turn off their mobile phones.

'We take a very conservative approach to how far before touchdown an aircraft should be completely configured for landing,' Jetstar chief pilot Mark Rindfleish said.

'In the case of JQ57, pilot distraction meant all the landing checklist items weren't completed before the aircraft passed an altitude of 500ft, at which point a go-around was required under our operating procedures.

'Human factors, like distraction, are why airlines have so many procedural safeguards built into how they fly.

A Jetstar spokesman said the airline counselled the pilots 'on human factors that lead to distraction in the cockpit.'
