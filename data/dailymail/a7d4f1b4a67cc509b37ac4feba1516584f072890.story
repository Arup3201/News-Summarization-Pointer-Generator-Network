A City accountant fractured her skull and died inches from her front door when she slipped down the staircase to her basement flat after a drunken night out, an inquest heard.

The body of tragic Jemma Brownlee, 29, who worked for top accounting firm Deloitte,Â  lay undiscovered outside her basement flat in Pimlico, central London, for more than 15 hours, the hearing was told.

She was found lying in a pool of blood outside her flat - just yards from the apartment where MI6 'spy in a bag' Gareth Williams was found dead - after her mother raised the alarm when she failed to arrive in the West Midlands for a planned visit, the inquest heard.

Tests revealed Ms Brownlee, a senior tax manager at international accountancy firm Deloitte, had drunk so much alcohol during a night out with friends that she was almost three times over the drink-drive limit, the hearing was told.

Her body was only found more than 16 hours after she left a bar in Soho, central London, when a friend was sent to check on her after she failed to turn up at her mother's house in Coventry where she had been due to visit.

Assistant Westminster Coroner Doctor Shirley Radcliffe said it was a 'a terrible tragedy for a girl of 29 in such a wonderful position in life and with a successful career' to die in such circumstances.

Following a spell at Barclays, Leeds University graduate Ms Brownlee had worked for Deloittes for seven years in its tax division, rising rapidly through the ranks to senior manager.

After work on Monday April 14 this year she had been out drinking in Soho, the inquest heard.

She had left pals at a venue on Archer Street around 11.30pm, hailing a a cab home, according to a police report read to the inquest.

She had been due to visit her mum, Lynne Brownlee, in Coventry the next day.

Westminster Coroners Court heard that Ms Brownlee took a taxi to her apartment in Pimlico, London, left, but slipped on the steps and fell down the stairs leading to her front door, right, where her body was discovered

However, when her daughter failed to show up she made a concerned phone call to Jemma's friend and work colleague Amy Wilson, the hearing was told.

PC Rhys Davis was called to the scene by paramedics just before 5pm on Tuesday April 15th.

In his report, he said: 'Miss Wilson then attended Miss Brownlee's flat on Alderney Street, Pimlico, and found her lying at the bottom of the stairs to her flat.

'A neighbour said she had touched her and found her cold and rigor mortis had set in.

'Her injuries appeared consistent with falling down the stairs.'

A paramedic's statement said there had been 'a large pool of blood around her head' and there was no way of saving her, although no precise time of death was given.

The inquest at Westminster Coroner's Court heard how the accountant had fractured her skull.

Criminal examiners ruled out foul play when they found her shoes strewn across a steep concrete staircase leading down to her basement flat, with her handbag and its contents lying untouched nearby.

A toxicologist's report said she had 218mg of alcohol in 100ml of her blood, over two-and-half times the legal drink-drive limit of 80mg.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Dr Radcliffe said: 'Clearly she had left the pub under the influence of alcohol and would have been undoubtedly intoxicated, which left her at risk of slipping.

'It is a terrible tragedy for a girl of 29 in such a wonderful position in life and with a successful career, she was a bright and capable woman.

'Sadly, it's a very clear situation and I shall therefore record that Jemma Louise Brownlee has died from cerebal oedema due to ethanol toxicity.

'My conclusion is that she has died as a result of an accident.'
