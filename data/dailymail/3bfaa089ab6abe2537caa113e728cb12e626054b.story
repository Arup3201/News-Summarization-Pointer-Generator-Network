Elephant fans have gathered in Thailand to celebrate the annual National Elephant Day honouring the tusked beasts.

In Pattaya resort, Chonburi province, 52 elephants were treated to an all-you-can-eat fruit buffet to mark the day.

A senior mahout, the Thai name for a professional elephant rider, blessed the animals with holy water before the annual event at the resort.

Events will be held all week in order 
to draw attention to the efforts to save the species and protect their 
shrinking habitats in Thailand.

Over the past decades Thailand has seen a sharp decline in wild animals, currently estimated at less than 3,000.

Yesterday the U.S. ambassador to 
Thailand, Kristie Kenney, called on the nation’s government to 
prioritise the problem of poachers targeting elephants in the wild.

Ms Kenney said the Thai government 
needs to issue clear-cut rules and regulations in order to save the 
endangered species, Pattaya Mail reported.

Visiting an Elephant Conservation 
Centre in Kanchanaburi province, Ms Kenney said it was a ‘good sign’ that Prime Minister Yinkluck Shinawatra had pledged to take action 
against ivory trade, but that further regulations to protect elephants 
needed to be ‘urgently addressed’.

The Asian elephant can be found across Asia from India to Borneo. There are three subspecies spread across Asia: the Sumatran, Sri Lankan and the Indian elephant.

It is smaller in size than it’s African relative and has been listed as an endangered species since 1986.

The biggest threats against its 
population is the destruction of the Asian elephant's natural habitats from expanding 
populations and infrastructure, as well as poaching.
