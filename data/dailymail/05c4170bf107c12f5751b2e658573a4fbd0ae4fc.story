Wanted: Watford forward Troy Deeney is a target for Leicester City but they have had two bids rejected

Money: The second bid of £7.5million has been rejected by Watford who want to keep hold of the striker

His performances have attracted interest from other Premier League sides, including Leicester's fellow promoted side Burnley.

He was released early from his 10-month sentence, after showing remorse and being a first time offender.
