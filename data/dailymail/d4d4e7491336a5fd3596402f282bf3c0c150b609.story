England's Under 17s made it through to the next phase of European Championship qualifying with a hard-fought win over Macedonia on Monday.

Manchester City striker Lukas Nmecha scored the decisive goal in Paphos, Cyprus as John Peacock's Young Lions made it two wins from two and progressed to the elite qualifying round.

Having beaten hosts Cyprus 4-1 on Saturday, England - who are the defending European champions following their success in Malta back in May - knew a win over the Macedonians would likely take them through.

Peacock made six changes from the team that beat Cyprus, with Everton's Tom Davies assuming the captain's armband in place of the suspended Reece Oxford.

Leicester City's Layton Ndukwu, who scored a hat-trick in Saturday's match, was moved to the left wing with Nmecha taking his place up front with Chelsea's Jacob Maddox just behind.

Macedonia, who needed a win to stay in contention after their weekend loss to France, started brightly but found themselves trailing after 14 minutes.

Maddox broke down the right to the byline and cut the ball back for Nmecha, evading his marker, to prod the ball home from close-range.

It was very nearly a short-lived lead - Macedonia set Emil Abaz free with a long ball and goalkeeper Paul Woolston needed sharp reflexes to keep out the winger's shot.

Maddox was England's most influential player in the first-half and a forward burst and cut-back to Chelsea colleague Charlie Wakefield nearly resulted in a second goal.

Newcastle stopper Woolston was called upon again early in the second-half when Macedonia captain Davor Zdravkovski took aim from close range.

And they had the ball in the net through defender Kiril Ristovski, only for an offside flag to cut short the celebrations.

Having weathered the second-half storm, England came within inches of doubling their lead with eight minutes remaining.

Arsenal's Chris Willock, who had replaced Nmecha, struck the crossbar with a curling shot from the edge of the box.

England held on to claim victory and ensure qualification in advance of Thursday's final match with France.

There is still something to play for, however, as the winner of that match will finish top of the Group 4 standings.

England will face another three teams in the elite qualifying round early next year to determine whether or not they will reach next summer's finals in Bulgaria.
