Two men helped rescue a family including a baby in its car seat from a burning car after it suddenly burst into flames.

The two worshippers were said to be celebrating the Jewish holiday of Passover in a nearby synagogue when they heard screaming outside in Tottenham, North London, yesterday evening.

When the men rushed to the family, they saw the car engulfed in flames.

The two men, one named locally as Moses Kupermann and one believed to be on holiday from Israel, then braved fierce flames to help drag an elderly man and a young child from the burning wreckage.

The elderly man had become stuck and panicked in the vehicle after he was unable to undo his seatbelt.

The child was then plucked from a baby seat in the back of the car, seconds before the vehicle exploded into flames.

Just seconds later, the car became a fireball, leaving the inside of the Peugeot burnt to ashes.

Firefighters prepared to tackle the fire which struck the car in which a family of four was travelling

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said it had been contacted by the car owner who informed police about the incident, describing the car as 'gutted'.

The spokesman said police did not attend the scene and there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the incident.
