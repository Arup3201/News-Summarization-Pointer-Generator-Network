Marcos Rojo will travel to Lisbon on Friday to finally collect his work visa.

The £16million Manchester United signing from Sporting Lisbon has been unable to collect his visa owing to his alleged involvement in a criminal investigation dating back to 2010 for which he has not been charged.

He initially travelled to England on a tourist visa last month but already qualified for his work permit automatically having played 75 per cent of Argentina's internationals over the past two years.

Rojo, 24, was with the Argentina squad in Germany on Wednesday and Thursday and will travel to the British Embassy in Lisbon on Friday to get the necessary paperwork attached to his passport.

That will allow him access to the UK on a work visa and will put him in contention to make his debut against Queens Park Rangers next Sunday, September 14.

United confirmed the UK Border Agency had finally agreed to grant Rojo a visa on Thursday.

Rojo completed his move to Old Trafford from Sporting Lisbon on August 20.
