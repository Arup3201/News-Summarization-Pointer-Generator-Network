In a pair of stunning 1993 memos from the Clinton White House, advisers to Bill and Hillary Clinton railed against physicians for putting personal greed ahead of 'Hillarycare' medical insurance reform, and wrote that scheduled listening-session meetings with health care stakeholders were political exercises organized purely for show.

Doctors suffer from an 'emotional irrationality' and a sense that they have a '"right" to be over-compensated,' wrote attorney Amy Lee Stewart to Hillary Clinton and her health care guru Ira Magaziner.

The Bill Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Arkansas released more than 4,000 pages of memos on Friday as part of the lengthy process of opening previously secret materials to the public.

Those were the days: The Clinton White House reasoned that doctors would only oppose the 'Hillarycare' insurance reform because they were greedy

Stewart is, and was, an antitrust specialist working for Little Rock's Rose Law Firm, which was later implicated in the Whitewater real estate scandal when the Clintons refused to produce billing records from Mrs. Clinton's tenure at the firm.

Stewart wrote of her perception 'that physicians are, on the whole, very agitated about what they perceive to be infringements on their ability to continue to make money which supports them in the lifestyle which they have anticipated and enjoyed over the last few decades.

Her complaint anticipated objections from the American Medical Association, which favored antitrust exemptions for any doctors who banded together to cut costs in the wake of new regulatory costs.

'They believe they are being (or will be) sandwiched between managed competition in which they have little power to protect their comfortable income and autonomy,' Stewart wrote, 'and increased taxes which will also reduce their spending power.'

She also seemed to mock health care providers for a sense of entitlement about the income levels that follow years of education, internships and low-paying residencies.

'Their misperceptions about taxes, malpractice reform, managed care, antitrust enforcement and their "right" to be over-compensated must all be addressed as much as possible,' Stewart wrote.

'Their remaining emotional irrationality cannot, and should not, be addressed by permitting anticompetitive behavior which will undermine the goals of reform.'

Reached at her law office, Stewart told MailOnline that she was 'sorry that I can't be of any help.'

'You have caught me on a busy Friday
afternoon and are asking about something I worked on over 20 years ago,' she said.

Rose Law Firm antitrust attorney Amy Lee Stewart (L) and future Labor Secretary Alexis Herman (R) wrote frank memos at the outset of the doomed Hillarycare effort which today sound callous

First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton would later move to New York, win a seat in the U.S. Senate, and become the U.S> secretary of state -- and now she's mulling a run for president

In another memo, a staffer who ran the White House Office of Public Liaison – in charge of interfacing with special interest groups – and her assistant, briefed the first lady on a plan to host two days of public hearings about her health care push.

'The primary goal for this two day hearing would be to inoculate ourselves from charges that we are refusing to listen to all those groups out there that want input,' wrote Alexis Herman, the future Labor Secretary, and Mike Lux.

'Even though our primary goal is political inoculation,' they counseled, 'we should not lose the opportunity for some public education.'

'Some testifiers should be average people with horror stories, middle class families worried about the future, and senior citizens. These average people should testify during those periods when we believe more people will be watching.'

The Little Rock documents were held back from public view for 12 years after the end of the Clinton administration, and should have been released a year ago.

Now that they have hit the Internet in large batches, Republicans will likely mine them for material they can use against Mrs. Clinton, who is expected to be the Democratic standard-bearer in the 2016 presidential election.
