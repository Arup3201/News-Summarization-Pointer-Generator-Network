An ancient Jewish cemetery has been unearthed by construction workers digging a tunnel in Turkey.

Graves and bones were found seven meters below ground level during the building project in the Aegean province of Izmir, the Turkish government confirmed.

Ironically, the extraordinary discovery was made in the area below the Archaeology Museum.

Discovery: The ancient Jewish cemetery was found by a construction team building a tunnel in the Aegean province of Izmir

The bones were packaged and delivered to the Jewish community of Izmir, while the graves were removed from the tunnel.

But archeologists believe they have not yet found the true extent of the burial site, which was still being used until the mid 19th Century.

A letter requesting permission for the removal and transfer of the tombstones was submitted to the Ministry of Culture, as it is the main authority in the field.

Jak Kaya, the Izmir Jewish Community President said that the bones will be reburied in the Altindag Jewish cemetery following a religious ritual.

Mr Kaya said: 'The excavations are ongoing. Since there is a possibility that more bones can be found, we are suspending the burials until we are certain that all bones were collected.

'We know that this cemetery had been used during the 19th century. It was kept open for burials until the Republican period, after we started to use the Gurcesme and Altindag cemeteries.'

Izmir, which has had a recorded urban history dating back more than 3,500 years, is home to Turkey's second largest Jewish community after Istanbul.

Through out history the area has been home to a signigicant Jewish population.
