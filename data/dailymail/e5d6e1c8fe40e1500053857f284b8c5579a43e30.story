The operator of a fireworks business in Washington state is accused of strapping an explosive to his dog and blowing up the animal because an ex-girlfriend had ‘put the devil in it,’ according to police.

Christopher Dillingham, 45, of Stevenson, ranted at deputies responding to reports of a blast that he was preparing for ‘the Rapture’ as he tossed a couch and other household items onto his lawn early Sunday morning, Deputy Jordan Ejde wrote in an affidavit.

Dillingham was held on $500,000 bail after he appeared in court Monday to face two counts of reckless endangerment and one count of possessing an explosive device for an unlawful purpose.

Skamania County Prosecutor Adam Kick said
his office has yet to charges the suspect with animal cruelty because 
there is no evidence that the dog suffered before death.

Dillingham's next court appearance is scheduled for August 15.

Deputies responded to reports from 
neighbors of a loud explosion at 3.45am Sunday and found the decapitated
yellow Labrador on the man's property in a semi-rural area on the 
outskirts of Stevenson, Undersheriff Dave Cox said.

Dillingham's son and his friend were at home during the gruesome incident, but were not hurt in the exposition. They later fled to an uncle’s home nearby, OregonLive reported.

Ravings: Dillingham was ranting about the end of the world as he was tossing furniture and other items out the window

When they arrived on the scene in the 2000 block of Loop road, officials discovered the remains of the pooch named Cabela scattered about Dillingham's yard.

According to Ejde's affidavit, Dillingham, who owns a fireworks business called Thundershack, told deputies he made the device from black powder taken from firecrackers.

Dillingham reportedly said he distracted Cabela with treats as he put the device on the pet, which had been given to him by an ex-girlfriend.

Cox said investigators believe the device was attached to the large dog's collar. The undersheriff said the dog died instantly.

During questioning, the man reportedly told investigators that the 'world is going to end' because of a nuclear strike he had been preparing.

When asked why he was tossing household items and coins out the window, the 45-year-old said he believed the 'souls of demons' were trapped inside metal objects in his home.

In court: The man is facing charges of reckless endangerment and possessing an explosive device, but not animal cruelty because it appears that the dog did not suffer since she was killed on the spot

The Metro bomb squad from Vancouver and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives assisted deputies in the investigation.

There have been conflicting reports in local news media regarding the history of the slain dog. According to KOIN News, a man by the name Sam Mims gave the pooch to his cousin, Dillingham’s girlfriend, because his landlord did not allow to keep pets.

However, in an emotional interview with the station KOMO News, a man by the name Ty Freemantle claimed that he had owned Cabela ever since she was six weeks old when he bought her off Craigslist. 

Freemantle tearfully recalled how six 
months ago, he handed over his beloved pet to Dillingham before moving 
to another city after a mutual friend had reassured him that the pet 
will be in good hands.

Legal woes: Dillingham's history of arrests stretches back to 1993 involving drunken driving charges

In a phone interview with MailOnline Tuesday, Undersheriff Cox was unable to clarify who had been Cabela’s owner prior to Dillingham. 

A prosecutor is in the process of reviewing the case to determine whether to charge Dillingham with animal cruelty charges.

Dillingham has had numerous run-ins with the law, beginning in 1993 when he was picked up on a charge of unauthorized use of a vehicle. According to reports, the 45-year-old father also has a history of domestic violence.
