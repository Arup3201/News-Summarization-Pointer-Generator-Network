Hundreds of Australian troops could be on the ground in Iraq as soon as Tuesday as the Federal Government moves to snuff the growing threat of terror group Islamic State.

It comes after a fleet of six super hornet fighter jets made their way to the Middle East for non-combat reconnaissance and intelligence operations.

A source within the Department of Defence said there could be as many as 200 soldiers on the ground within days,The Daily Telegraph reported.

Approval for personnel to start training the local army to defend themselves against Islamic State is expected to be given by the end of the week.

Authorities have warned a 'long campaign' lies ahead for forces in Iraq, with the recently deployed Air Task Group of F/A 18 jets thought to be the largest since the Vietnam War.

They joined aircraft and tanker transportation already operating in the Middle East.

Defence Minister David Johnston said the government was 'optimistic' that they could quell the threat of Islamic State quickly.

But he added: 'We must say months and more because we want to under-promise and over-deliver here.

'I'm quietly confident... but the fact is, we haven't even begun to deal with the threat to the civilian population in Iraq.'

Mr Johnston also said there was a chance Australian troops could be the focus of insider attack, which were seen during the Afghanistan War.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has claimed that the Australian public supports a military campaign against Islamic State, as Australian fighter jets prepare to head to Iraq.

It comes after Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop claimed the Australian public supports a military campaign against Islamic State, as Australian fighter jets prepare to head to Iraq.

Ms Bishop labelled the 'murderous terrorist organisation' as a threat not only to the Middle East but to Australia and the rest of the world, during the the United Nations Security Council in early September.

'The international community cannot with any conscience turn away,' she said.

On Saturday, the foreign affairs minister said sending Australian armed forces overseas 'is one of the most significant and serious decisions that any government can make,'

'We have considered it from every angle, and considered every option, and we know that Australia’s national security is at risk,' Ms Bishop told The Sunday Times.

'ISIS and similar organisations are not only threatening the people of Iraq and beyond, but Australia,' she said. 

'There have been a number of videos where Australia has specifically been mentioned as a terrorist target.'

'I believe the Australian people understand the threat, and support the Australian Government doing all it can to keep them safe.'  

'We have considered it from every angle, and considered every option, and we know that Australia’s national security is at risk,' said Ms Bishop

The super hornet jets have returned to base in Dubai, and air strikes are anticipated to begin as early as Sunday evening

A Galaxy poll revealed that 62% of Australian voters are in favour of the Federal Government's decision to begin air strikes in Iraq against Islamic State

A Galaxy poll revealed that 62% of Australian voters are in favour of the Federal Government's decision to begin air strikes in Iraq against Islamic State.

A further three-quarters of voters also believed the threat of a terrorism attack on Australian soil was real.

Ms Bishop reinforced the findings of the poll as she addressed security concerns on Saturday.

Security and intelligence agencies were 'concerned that a terrorist attack could take place' within Australia, Ms Bishop said.

'They are not saying that one is imminent but they are saying Australia is a target,' she said.

'ISIS and similar organisations are opposed to open, tolerant and free societies. 

'Australia represents what they oppose and they try to eliminate any opposition to their crazy and murderous ideology.'

Ms Bishop encouraged Australians to continue their lives and to be 'pragmatic'.
