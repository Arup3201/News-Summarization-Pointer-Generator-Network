Stuart Broad has spoken of his shock at hearing that Australian batsman Phil Hughes suffered a life-threatening head injury and offered his sympathy to the 22-year-old bowler who delivered the delivery.

The England all-rounder — whose nose was broken in two places when a ball from India fast bowler Varun Aaron smashed through his visor during the fourth Test last summer — talked about the incident which left Hughes fighting for his life and New South Wales fast bowler Sean Abbott requiring counselling.

Fingers crossed he can show the same fight as he has throughout his career and he can pull through. Our whole dressing room is just massively concerned for Phil and we hope he can fight as much as he can.

‘I woke up yesterday and had a text from my mum saying “Awful news about Phil Hughes”,’ the Mail on Sunday columnist told Sportsmail. 

‘Immediately my heart sank and I thought “What on earth has happened?” I saw he’d been hit on the head and was in a critical condition. It’s desperate news. The cricketing world is hoping Phil pulls through.

‘No one who plays cricket wants to see these sorts of injuries. Everyone is just praying Phil wakes up in the next 24 hours and is ok.

‘As a fast bowler you bowl a short ball with aggressive intent but then as soon as you hit someone your entire body stops and all you care about is the wellbeing of that person.

‘You’ve got to feel sorry for the lad who bowled the bouncer but he can’t feel any guilt that he bowled a bouncer. That’s part of a bowler’s armoury. He’s done nothing wrong.’

Broad’s own injuries last summer amounted to a badly broken nose and extensive bruising after he top-edged a delivery into his face. As a fast bowler capable of hitting speeds of up to 90mph, the 28-year-old is aware of the pitfalls of what is sometimes mistakenly considered to be a genteel sport.

‘It takes bravery to play cricket,’ he said. ‘The ball can come down at great speed and as a batsman you can take all sorts of blows. I was very fortunate. I broke my nose in two places but I don’t have any long-term problems. My helmet took a lot of the pace off the ball. You saw a piece break off and that actually took a lot of speed off the ball.

‘It looks as if Phil was hit straight on the head. At the sort of speed the ball is bowled at, it is obviously a very worrying time.

‘I remember hitting Craig Kieswetter in 2010 and he went down for four or five minutes. We were encouraging him to go off the field but he carried on batting.

‘I also hit Chris Rogers at the MCG in the Boxing Day Test match. It hit him so hard on his helmet he had to replace it altogether.

‘When something like this happens it puts everything into perspective. Sport is about rivalries but it’s also about having camaraderie and friends for life.’

Hughes was last night in a critical condition in a Sydney hospital after emergency surgery to stop bleeding on his brain caused by the blow to the back of his head.

‘You’ve seen with all the messages of support what a popular figure Phil is,’ said Broad. ‘Everyone is desperate for good news. You see guys get hit in the head in sport, you see boxers get knocked out and get up again. The whole cricketing world is just hoping Phil gets up from this.’
