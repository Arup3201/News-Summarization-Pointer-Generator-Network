Borussia Dortmund star Marco Reus has been fined £427,000 for a series of driving offences - the highest sanction of its kind ever handed out in the country - according to German newspaper Bild.

The 25-year-old Germany forward was allegedly stopped by police several times and received speeding tickets on at least five occasions since 2011, before the authorities realised he had been driving without a licence ever since.

Reus told Bild: 'I decided back then to take that road but the reasons I did it are something I cannot really understand today.'

Reus' astronomical fine has accrued from offences committed since 2011 to the current day

Dortmund's prosecutor's office said the fine was related to incidents from 2011 until this March.

'Today I know that I was too naive and that it was stupid. I have learned my lesson and this will not happen again,' Reus added.

Reus, who missed Germany's World Cup triumph in July after picking up an injury in the final warm-up game, is a transfer target of several major European clubs, with his release clause £19.8million.

The club were unavailable for comment.
