Featuring  masonry columns, painted gold features, two galleries, wrought iron balustrading and a glass-domed lantern roof, a wing of the South Australian State Library has been listed among the top-20 most beautiful libraries in the world.

The Mortlock Wing opened in 1884 in Adelaide CBD, and still features original furniture and a large Dent and Son clock over its main hall.

The wing joins the likes of Oxford University's Bodleian library in England, the Marciana Library in Venice, Italy, the Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Egypt, America's Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. and the Royal Library in Copenhagen, Denmark, in the list compiled by Travel and Leisure website.

'Old World': An employee said the library had a Harry Potter-esque magic feel to it

Jo Chesher has worked at the South Australian State Library for more than 10 years and said she still gets goosebumps when walking into the wing.

She said the wing's clock is wound by staff each week and has an 'audible tick', which excites visiting school kids.

'It also seems to be getting a reputation of being rather Harry Potter-esque, with an Old World and a bit of a magic feel to it,' she told AAP.

'I would describe it as magnificent and grand, but not too big as it has an almost intimate ambience.'

Books at the library date back to colony times and can still be inspected

The wing opened in 1884 and is located within the library in Adelaide CBD

Considered one of the most beautiful parts of a library in the world, the wing took 18 years to build

Taking 18 years to build, the wing first opened as a public library, museum and art Gallery with 23,000 books and three staff.

The length building process was due to political indecision and delays, design changes and issues relating to the building being over an underground stream, which caused the foundations unstable, reported State Library of South Australia.

Original features of the wing include two gas 'sunburner' lamps in the office space on the second floor and some remaining wallpaper in a room off the ground floor.

While students are able to study at grand heavy timber desks, visitors from across the globe are greeted by one of the library's 30 volunteer ambassadors.

The Bibliotheca Alexandrina, in Alexandria, Egypt also made the list of the world's most beautiful libraries

Denmark's Royal Library Copenhagen was one of the more contemporary libraries to be featured thanks to its modern features

Marciana Library, located in St Mark's Square in Venice, Italy features ornate detailing both inside and out

'Visitors are gobsmacked - after first going through a very modern, glass, light and timber walkway they then literally take a step back in time.'

Among the selection of old books are half-a-dozen which came to Australia in trunks during colony times and can be taken out of shelves and inspected.

Some of the first-floor balcony-level books are from the early 1900s and were originally circulated to people in country South Australia.

The South Australian State Library was the only in Australia to make the list, piping out the NSW State Library and Victoria State Library.

Two American libraries made the list including the Library of Congress in Washington, which features spectacular masonry

Oxford University's Bodleian Library is the second biggest in England one of the oldest in Europe
