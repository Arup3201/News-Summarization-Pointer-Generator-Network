Ed Miliband today challenged David Cameron to sign up to TV debates at the next election.

The Labour leader told the Prime Minister to 'stop ducking and diving' and agree to repeat the live broadcasts first seen during the 2010 campaign.

Mr Miliband ruled out the idea of UKIP leader Nigel Farage being given a place insisting it should be the same format as last time, with Lib Dems, Labour and Tories represented.

Many senior Tories blame the debates in 2010 for Mr Cameron's failure to secure an outright majority.

He performed badly in the first encounter, while Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg benefited from being comparatively unknown.

Conservative strategists feared Mr Farage could enjoy a similar boost in the polls if he was given a platform in the debates.

But Mr Miliband made clear it should be a straight battle between the three main party leaders.

Speaking during a Q&A session at the Labour party conference, Mr Miliband said: 'It is time for David Cameron to stop ducking and diving to agree to the TV debates just like the last general election, so the country can make its choice.'

In 2010 each main broadcaster hosted a debate, including Sky News, ITV and BBC.

Mr Clegg enjoyed a surge in the polls in the 2010 polls as a relatively unknown figure alongside Mr Cameron and Gordon Brown.

Until recently Labour had hoped to capitalise on the rise of UKIP, hoping it would split the centre-right vote and allow them to clinch crucial swing seats.

But recent polls suggest UKIP has taken support from all the main parties.

Mr Farage has said he is prepared to take legal action to get into televised leaders’ debates if Mr Cameron tries to freeze him out.

The Prime Minister has publicly expressed concern that the three debates 'sucked the life' out of the last campaign.

He has called for future debates to take place in the months before the May 2015 vote, rather than in the final weeks - a plan that has been privately ridiculed by broadcasters.

'I think TV debates are good. I enjoyed them last time - particularly the last one. We have a fixed-term Parliament now, so we can think about it in a slightly different way,' he said in December.

'I haven’t made my mind up exactly what we should do. My reflection on last time was that they did take all the life out of the campaign.

'The press and all of us were interested in the run-up to the debate, the debate and the post-debate analysis, not the rest of the campaign, which I really enjoy.

'I like campaigning, I like being out there, the public meetings, the awkward moments, the difficulties.

'It is an incredibly exciting time, trying to explain what you are about and what you are trying to do. I found the TV debates took all the life out of it.'

Downing Street signalled that Mr Cameron would agree to the debates, but again questioned the format.

Aides
pointed out that in January Mr Cameron said: 'I'm in favour of them, I 
think they are good and I think we should go on having them, and I will 
play my part in trying to make that happen.'

A
Number 10 spokesman added: 'As for what format they will take, they are
still quite a long way off and it is yet to be discussed.'

Former Tory spin doctor Andy Coulson has warned that the Tories should not pull out, using an article in GQ magazine to tell Mr Cameron: 'Don't be chicken'.

He argued that Mr Cameron actually won two of the three debates last time. 'They sealed the deal on the question of him being seen as PM material.'

He added: 'It's also nonsense to suggest the debates starved the public of discussion on the big issues. The debate format allowed for more direct exposure to the leaders views.'
