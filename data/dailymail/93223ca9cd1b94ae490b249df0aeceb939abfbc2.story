An inmate on death row used his last breath to protest his innocence of the murder of a 12-year-old girl as he was executed in Texas last night despite his legal team arguing he was mentally ill.

Jonathan Green, 44, was jailed for the abduction, rape and strangling of Christina Neal, 12, whose body was found at his home  a month after she was reported missing in 2000.

Several last ditch appeals were made on the basis of his mental health in an attempt to save him from the death penalty but Green was given a lethal injection after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the arguments to spare him.

The 11th-hour appeals delayed the punishment nearly five hours past the initial 6pm execution time and as the midnight expiration of the death warrant neared.

Asked by the warden if he had a statement from the death chamber gurney, Green shook his head and replied: 'No'

But seconds later he changed his mind, adding: 'I'm an innocent man. I never killed anyone. Y'all are killing an innocent man.'

He then looked down at his left arm where one of the needles carrying the lethal drug was inserted, and said: 'It's hurting me bad.'

But almost immediately he began snoring loudly. The sounds stopped after about six breaths.

Green was pronounced dead 18 minutes later at 10.45pm.

The family of Green's victim lived across a highway from him in Dobbin, about 45 miles northwest of Houston, when she disappeared.

Investigators questioned Green at least twice in the days following Christina's disappearance 12 years ago. 

Delusional belief: Jonanthan Green claimed he couldn't have killed the Montgomery County schoolgirl, who disappeared while walking home in Dobbin, because letters exist that show he was somewhere in Conroe when the victim died

His wallet was found in some woods near clothing and jewellery that belonged to Christina but authorities found nothing else of significance at the time.

A few weeks later, a tip from a neighbour about an unusually large burn pile behind his ramshackle home brought them back again.

While Green had been cooperative in the past, he grew testy and ordered them off his property when an FBI agent looking at the fire site detected the smell of a decaying body and inserted a metal probe into a patch of disturbed earth.

The death penalty is currently a legal sentence for crimes ranging from drug trafficking to murder in 33 American states.

There has been increasing opposition to capital punishment in the U.S. and seventeen states - including Washington, D.C. - have banned its use.

But many states, such as Texas, Virginia, Oklahoma and Florida, still impose the death penalty.

There have been a total of 486 executions in Texas since 1976 - the highest amount of all American states - with 317 inmates currently on death row.  

Green's lethal injection is the 10th this year in Texas and the first of four scheduled for this month in the nation's most active death penalty state.

Virginia has the second highest number of executions with 109 since 1976 but has just 12 inmates on death row.

And while California has only conducted 13 executions in the last 36 years, it has the highest number of prisoners on death row, with 721 awaiting their sentence.

Florida - which has the fourth highest number of executions with 73 since 1976 - currently has the second highest number of death row inmates with 402.

But the number of Americans in favour of capital punishment is decreasing.

There were 37 executions in the United States in 2008 - the lowest number since 1994.

In 2010, 46 people were executed and in 2011, 43 inmates were all killed by lethal injection.

But a 2011 Gallup poll showed 61 per cent of Americans favored capital punishment in cases of murder while 35 per cent opposed it - the lowest level of support recorded by Gallup since 1972.

They returned hours later with a search warrant and a dog trained to detect human remains.

The dog led officers to the girl's body, stuffed inside a laundry bag in the home and wedged into a corner behind a piece of furniture.

Green contended someone else had placed the body there and that he was being set up.

Evidence at his trial indicated he had tried to burn the body, buried it in a shallow grave, then removed it when detectives left to obtain the search warrant.

DNA from her remains tied him to the slaying. A carpet fiber from her panties found in the woods was traced to a carpet in his home.

Christina's parents were among people to watch Green die. They declined to speak with reporters following the execution.

Green's lethal injection is the 10th this year in Texas and the first of four scheduled for this month in the nation's most active death penalty state.

Green's lawyers argued his hallucinations made him ineligible for the death penalty and said a state competency hearing for him two years ago was unfair.

That led to a reprieve from a federal district judge in Houston.

But the Texas attorney general's office persuaded the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn that ruling and lift the stay of execution late Tuesday.

Green's lawyer, James Rytting, said his client hallucinated about the 'ongoing spiritual warfare between two sets of voices representing good and evil'.

The appeals court ruled that none of Green's hearings had been unfair and it was reasonable to find Green competent for the death penalty.

Green told a psychiatrist who examined him before the competency hearing that he didn't and couldn't have killed Christina, that false evidence was used against him and that he understood a murder conviction could result in him receiving an injection that would kill him.

Supreme Court guidance says mental illness can't disqualify someone from execution if they understand the sentence and reasons for the punishment, the state lawyers argued.
