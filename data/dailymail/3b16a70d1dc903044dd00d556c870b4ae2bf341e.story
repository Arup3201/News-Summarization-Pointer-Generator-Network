It once stood proudly on the London skyline as a symbol of the supremacy of our British Empire.

But since a 1936 fire destroyed the Crystal Palace on Penge Common, near Sydenham Hill in south-east London, the building that once housed the 1851 Great Exhibition has never been rebuilt.

However it could now rise again, following the news that a Chinese billionaire is planning to re-build an exact replica of the Crystal Palace for events and exhibitions where the original burned down.

And this mocked-up photograph shows just how the building may look among the houses, trees and tower blocks of today's south-east London skyline.

Original steps: Since a 1936 fire destroyed the Crystal Palace on Penge Common, near Sydenham Hill in south-east London, the building that once housed the Great Exhibition of 1851 has never been rebuilt

Eerie: Mainly original staircases still stand on the site where the Crystal Palace once was in south-east London

Park life: The scene where the North Nave - from approximately outside the concert hall - of the Crystal Palace once stood on Penge Common in south-east London before it was destroyed by a fire

Memories: Earlier this month MailOnline reported how sources said the plan was still at the 'very early stages', and London Mayor Boris Johnson confirmed that he had been approached by a potential developer

Ni Zhaoxing, who heads ZhongRong Holdings, has had talks with Bromley Council and the Greater London Authority about recreating the 900,000 sq ft glass halls, first designed by Sir Joseph Paxton.

Earlier this month MailOnline reported how sources said the plan was still at the ‘very early stages’, and London Mayor Boris Johnson confirmed that he had been approached by a potential developer.

The original structure was designed by Sir Joseph and stood in Hyde Park, central London, where the exhibition was held. In 1854 it was rebuilt in a larger form on Penge Common, until the 1936 fire.

The Shanghai-based real estate firm will be putting a planning application in to the council later this year - but the news has been badly received by campaigners worried about development in the park.

Fire of 1936: The original Palace stretched from what is now the bus station to the TV mast - and the Crystal Palace Community Association chairman said such a development would not be possible today

Grand: The Crystal Palace is pictured from 800ft in March 1920, 16 years before the fire destroyed the building

Skyline: The Crystal Palace (pictured in 1932, with Shirley Windmill in the foreground) was rebuilt in an enlarged form on Penge Common, next to Sydenham Hill, an affluent south London suburb full of large villas

The original Palace stretched from 
what is now the bus station to the TV mast - and Crystal Palace 
Community Association chairman John Payne said such a development would 
not be possible today.

He 
said: ‘It may have been the site of the Crystal Palace - but it is now 
metropolitan open land, which is protected. I think Bromley Council 
should be making this point very strongly to any developer.

‘Privately
Bromley Council still harbours an aspiration to see a major development
on the top of the park so the park does always seem to be somewhat 
under threat. There is a feeling of real déjà vu.’

Crystal
Palace Campaign chairman Ray Sacks added: ‘We're not at the “chaining 
to the bulldozer” phase yet, but we should have the chains ready.

‘To
accommodate a full scale Crystal Palace, the Crystal Palace Act of 1990
would have to be changed since it limits the footprint of buildings to 
half of the 'pink' area (defined in the act).

Last days: The Crystal Palace is shown in 1936, illuminated by the light of a Brocks fireworks display shortly before it burned down

Interior: The North Nave of the Crystal Palace building is pictured in this undated photograph, looking north

After the fire: Ruins and remains of the North Nave of Crystal Palace from a position outside the Concert Hall

‘This amounts to about a quarter of the original Palace footprint. There is a long way to go before we get to the stage of the top site being desecrated.’

A Bromley Council spokesman said: ‘It is a matter of public record we are committed to improving Crystal Palace Park which remains a jewel, not just in Bromley, but in London's crown.

‘We are continuing to look at and explore all funding options, including grant funding, that might be available to help secure a long term and viable future.’

ZhongRong was set up in 1992 by Mr Ni, a married father of four and self-made businessman said to have a fortune of £830,000. He was a new entry this year in the Forbes ‘billionaires list’.

Mr Ni’s past projects include the futuristic Zhongrong Jasper Tower in Shanghai’s financial district and Chang’an No.1 in Beijing, a group of 78 European-style villas set in a mountain landscape.

Queen Victoria's husband Prince Albert had originally come up with the idea of an exhibition to show off Britain's industrial achievements.It was a huge triumph for Albert, who rarely enjoyed public popularity in Britain, and he used the profits made to help establish the South Kensington museums in central London.

Relocation: The Crystal Palace moved to Penge Common near Sydenham Hill in south-east London in 1854

Smoke and ashes: The flames from the blaze in south-east London could be seen from eight counties

Destruction: The Crystal Palace in the aftermath of the 1936 fire, witnessed by tens of thousands of people
