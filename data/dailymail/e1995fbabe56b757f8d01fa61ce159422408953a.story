Tracked down: A new documentary has heard from FBI agents who have revealed how Boston mobster James 'Whitey' Bulger was finally captured thanks to a stray cat and a boob job

For 14 years, America's most-wanted criminal James 'Whitey' Bulger and his moll Catherine Greig evaded capture by posing as any other elderly couple in a low-key suburb of LA.

Now the FBI has revealed for the first time how the pair were finally tracked down when two vastly different pieces of the jigsaw came together to out them - her love of a stray cat and her vanity as a younger woman when she opted for a boob job.

Bulger, a notorious Boston underworld kingpin was jailed for life earlier this month after a 40-year career of murder, extortion, money-laundering, arms trafficking and drug dealing.

The 84-year-old was arrested in 2011 after years on the run at the apartment he shared with Greig in Santa Monica, where residents told how the couple blended in like all the other retired couples.

Speaking to 60 Minutes on CBS News, neighbour Barbara Gluck remembered how Greig always fed a stray cat after its owner had died.

She said: 'She would pet it, you know, and be sweet to it and she put a plate of food like out here. She loved the cat.'

Bulger had been a great source of 
embarrassment for the FBI after he had infiltrated the Boston office of 
the bureau and bought off agents who protected him.

They gave him the tip that allowed Bulger to flee just days before he was to be indicted in 1995.

Some feared he would never been caught.

The film heard from FBI agents who told how they had struggled to find a workable lead for ten years - nor did they have any good photographs of the pair.

They were aware of the couple's love of animals, but appeals to veterinarians proved unsuccessful.

There had also been reports that Greig had once had breast implants and other plastic surgery in Boston before they fled the city, and, grasping at straws, they turned to cosmetics surgeons in the hope of a clue.

To their astonishment, one came from Dr Matthias Donelan, who not only found her file in storage - but crucially, photographs.

Agent
 Tommy MacDonald, who joined the Bulger taskforce in 2009, told the 
programme called The Gaskos: 'I was trying to leave the office a little 
early to catch one of my kids' ballgames.

'And I said, "Well, listen - I'm gonna swing by in the morning and pick those up."

'And
 they said to me - "Do you want the photos too?" 'And I said "You have 
photos?" And they said, "Yeah, we have photos." I said, "We'll be there 
in 15 minutes."'

Armed with 
the picture, the FBI decided to switch strategy to focus on finding 
Greig and created public service announcements on daytime talk shows 
aimed at women.

Then they got a call from a neighbour.

Deputy U.S. 
Marshall Neil Sullivan, who took the lead, said: 'The tipster specifically
 described that they were caring for this cat and their love for this 
cat.

'So that was just 
one piece of the puzzle on the tip that added up to saying "if this 
isn’t them it’s something we better check out immediately because it 
sure sounds like them."'

Bulger disappeared in 1995 as law enforcement agencies were about to arrest him

When officers closed in, more
 than $822,000 and 30 guns were found hidden in the walls of the 
couple’s rent-controlled apartment, where they had been living there 
under assumed identities with Grieg running errands, buying her aging 
lover’s medication and paying bills.

Bulger
 was sentenced to life in prison earlier this month for his murderous 
reign of terror in the 1970s and '80s, bringing to a close a case that 
exposed FBI corruption so deep that many people across the city thought 
he would never be brought to justice.

He
 was defiant to the end, calling his trial on racketeering charges a 
sham and refusing to testify or provide information to probation 
officials preparing a sentencing report for the judge.

The
 jury convicted Bulger in 11 of the 19 killings he was charged with 
participating in, but acquitted him of seven and could not reach a 
conclusion on an eighth.

Greig was sentenced separately to eight years for aiding and abetting him.
