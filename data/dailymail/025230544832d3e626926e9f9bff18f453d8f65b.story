Commons speaker John Bercow, right, with his wife Sally has been criticised over his plan to appoint Carol Mills as £200,000-a-year Commons Clerk

The man who led John Bercow’s campaign to be Speaker has warned him he could lose his job over his controversial plan to give Parliament’s top job to an inexperienced Australian woman.

Senior Conservative MP Charles Walker told Mr Bercow he must give in to demands for MPs to quiz Australian official Carol Mills about allegations of misconduct before she is given the £200,000-a-year job of Commons Clerk.

The move is a serious blow to Mr Bercow’s hopes of surviving the row. Mr Walker is a close personal and political ally of Mr Bercow and performed the traditional role of ‘dragging’ him to the Speaker’s chair when he was elected in 2009.

The disclosure came as Mr Bercow launched a desperate attempt to save his career yesterday by promising to slash the powers of Ms Mills – before she has even started work.

He said he would split the Commons Clerk into two, with a clerk in charge of advising MPs on constitutional and legal issues and a new chief executive role to take charge of parliamentary administration.

It would pave the way for Ms Mills to become Commons chief executive – and keep her out of the Commons chamber.

But senior MPs said it was ‘too little too late’, would saddle taxpayers with another six-figure salary – and vowed to carry on their campaign to defeat him and block Ms Mills.

Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘This is a grubby compromise to get the Speaker out of a hole and it won’t wash.’ And Tory grandee Bernard Jenkin, who has led criticism of Mr Bercow over the issue, dismissed the job split plan, saying: ‘It does not clear the way for Ms Mills to be appointed Clerk – it just adds to the confusion and concern. The appointment process should be stopped and must go back to the drawing board.’

Mr Jenkin said if Mr Bercow refuses to back down, David Cameron should refuse to send Ms Mills’s appointment to Buckingham Palace for the Queen’s necessary approval.

And Mr Jenkin insisted his powerful Public Affairs Administration Committee must have the right to interrogate Ms Mills, who is involved in an investigation into ‘spying’ at the Australian Senate in Canberra where she is head of the Department of Parliamentary Services.

Last week's Mail on Sunday reported on the row behind John Bercow's attempted parliamentary power grab 

Her role, which includes responsibility for catering and cleaning, has led to her being dubbed the ‘Canberra caterer’ by Westminster wags.

The row over her appointment intensified last night after claims that a warning was ignored about ‘problems’ in Ms Mills’s record in Australia was ignored by the committee of MPs – headed by Bercow – that chose her.

The warning is understood to have been flagged up in a report to MPs by a firm of headhunters dealing with the appointment. But an attempt by one MP to ask the headhunters – Saxton Bampfylde – for more details was brushed aside, a source said. He added: ‘It was obvious there was something in her background that needed to be checked thoroughly. Two members of the panel asked for the information but were told there wasn’t time and it wasn’t relevant. It would appear Bercow had decided he wanted Mills and did not want to hear anything against her.

‘If the panel had asked for the details, they would have heard the full story over investigations into Ms Mills at the Australian Senate – and she would probably have been ruled out.’

Mr Bercow’s critics say Ms Mills is unfit to perform the Commons Clerk role because she has no experience of parliamentary procedure. Some claim he wants to take advantage of her lack of qualifications to grab more power for himself.

The Speaker’s credibility took another knock with reports that all three of his Deputy Speakers, Labour’s Lindsay Hoyle and Dawn Primarolo and Tory Eleanor Laing, oppose Ms Mills’s appointment.

Last night Bercow allies denied the headhunters’ advice was ignored and insisted Ms Mills herself had mentioned the two Senate inquiries.
