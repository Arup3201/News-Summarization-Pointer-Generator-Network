Gareth Southgate was irritated. England had just put one over their oldest rivals in thrilling circumstances but something was gnawing away at the Under 21 head coach.

For some reason, Southgate couldn’t get over the first 25 minutes at the Riverside Stadium, even though England had beaten Germany 3-2.

England, he felt, were overawed by Germany who looked a team of stars, passing smoothly in tight areas, winning cute free-kicks and making their experience tell.

They were doing everything their numbers suggested they would.

The numbers?

Norwich's Nathan Redmond, who scored England's second goal, deserves a Premier League return

Jesse Lingard levelled for England to make it 1-1 in Middlesbrough during an impressive victory 

James Ward-Prowse hit the winner to give Gareth Southgate's men a tremendous win ahead of Euro 2015

Nathan Redmond: West Ham and Stoke considered moves for the winger last summer. Should Norwich fail to get promotion, he might be going up any way.

Danny Ings: Currently exploring his options with his deal at Burnley ending in June. Liverpool is his most likely destination.

Luke Garbutt: Out of contract with Everton at the end of the season, Roberto Martinez is convinced he will sign a new deal. If he can’t, others will be on alert.

Jack Butland: Just three FA Cup games is not enough for England’s No 3 keeper since returning to Stoke from his Derby loan. If Asmir Begovic doesn’t moves on, he might.

Will Hughes: Some may think he is too lightweight but Hughes is an elegant player. If Derby don’t make the leap into the Premier League, others may try to entice him.

Tom Carroll: Tottenham midfielder on loan at Swansea, a club that suits his style. He would benefit from making the switch permanent.

The team Horst Hrubesch selected had 639 top-flight appearances between them; the squad’s combined number was a staggering 977. That figure would have been more than 1,100 had key players Bernd Leno and Kevin Volland not withdrawn through injury.

Marc-Andre ter Stegen, the German goalkeeper, is only 22 but he is playing in the Champions League with Barcelona, Emre Can with Liverpool and Max Meyer’s goal against Maribor in December helped Schalke reach the last 16 of the Champions League.

How does the top-flight experience of the England starting XI measure up? The figure is 230, the squad’s total is 389.

It gives credence to the point FA chairman Greg Dyke has made about young English players not getting sufficient opportunities but when you see the impressive way they tore into Germany, it makes you wonder why some can’t break through the glass ceiling.

Southgate has been deservedly praised for how he has handled things since taking over in September 2013 but a run of one defeat in 16 games — with 13 victories — is not solely down to the man in charge.

Southgate was not happy with the first 25 minutes of England's match against their German counterparts

‘We want to get the ball down and score lots of goals,’ said James Ward-Prowse, whose late goal defeated Germany. ‘It’s also down to players putting in the effort.’

Ward-Prowse is one of the luckier squad members. With 67 Barclays Premier League appearances, he was the most experienced starter against Germany and has benefited from being at Southampton, where youth is given its head.

So what about the rest?

Experts talk about a team’s spine but England had four players — goalkeeper Jonathan Bond, Ben Gibson, Jake Forster-Caskey and Will Hughes — in key positions who had never kicked a ball at the highest level.

‘I spoke to Oliver Bierhoff about what happened in Germany,’ John Barnes, the Liverpool and England legend, told Sportsmail two years ago. ‘The German Federation said in 2002 they needed young German players to be playing regularly for their clubs to help the national team.

‘All the clubs are German-owned, so they feel a responsibility to the national team. Bayern Munich had to be the drivers. The clubs had to go through a period of not winning anything in Europe but look at them now.’

Hughes has been linked with a number of Premier League clubs, most notably Liverpool, but nobody has taken the plunge. Skilful, elegant and thriving under Steve McClaren at Derby, he scored the goal against Croatia last October which secured England’s place at Euro 2015.

Will Hughes is good enough to play in the PRemier League, despite his diminutive status

Danny Ings showcased his talents too, and he is looking likely to ply his trade away from Burnley

Jesse Lingard, who scored against Germany, is another who is benefiting from working with McClaren but the odds are against him getting regular game time at Manchester United after his loan spell. But if not United, why not somewhere else in the Premier League?

Will anyone gamble on Nathan Redmond? The Norwich winger, who excelled against Germany, believes the Championship has toughened him up since his side were relegated last May and a good showing in the finals this summer will help him. Critics will argue they are not good enough or lack mental toughness but the way they played on Monday doesn’t back that up.

Germany are the best team England have faced at this level since Spain at Euro 2011, when they were chasing shadows before scrambling a 1-1 draw with a late Danny Welbeck goal.

The performance against Germany showed how much England have evolved and why they are genuine contenders to win the European Under 21 Championship, even if their numbers suggest they don’t have enough experience.

‘We’ve got good quality in the team,’ said Ward-Prowse.

‘The games will be different in the summer, but we can take a lot of confidence into the tournament.’
