Not for a second was Saido Berahino neglecting to celebrate this one. A goal late on to win a game that had been drifting to a stale draw against a relegation rival is enough to make even the most professional of strikers smile.

Tony Pulis wants to keep hold of the England Under-21 international this window and little wonder. He was man of the match by a distance here, the only player on the pitch who bore a cutting edge.

Twelve minutes from the end his razor finish brought Pulis victory on his first league match in charge of West Bromwich Albion.

Ahmed Elmohamady needlessly passed the ball back to goalkeeper Allan McGregor, who picked up instinctively. Referee Neil Swarbrick awarded an indirect free-kick eight yards out on the angle.

Substitute Victor Anichebe touched the ball and despite four onrushing Hull players and two more on the line, Berahino’s low shot found the back of the net.

Four times he declined to show delight when scoring against Gateshead last weekend. Not a bit of it here. Arms out wide, flapping gleefully, he ran to the corner to share the moment with Albion fans.

West Brom are up to 14th with this win, Hull down to 17th, out of the relegation zone on goal difference.

Pulis had emerged in customary tracksuit garb; navy baseball cap pulled over his head, gleaming white trainers on his feet.

His clothing was no shock, but some names in his team raised eyebrows. Chris Baird, Claudio Yacob and Brown Ideye all started in a 4-4-2 formation.

Club-record signing Ideye produced another performance that made his £9million price tag beggar belief. There was the lack of pace to reach an early Chris Brunt pass, the absence of strength to hold up play.

But worse came three minutes before the interval. Andre Wisdom fed Berahino, whose deft first-time touch released Ideye clean through. A glorious chance, he looked anything but confident, a rabbit in headlights, and scuffed his shot horribly wide.

Pulis let out an agonised cry as he swirled away and adjusted his cap, resisting the temptation to throw it to the ground.

By this point Hull’s attack had been decimated, Nikica Jelavic and Abel Hernandez forced off within minutes of each other. Hernandez held his groin after stretching for the ball, Jelavic strapped ice to his knee when on the bench. 

Tom Ince and Robbie Brady were sent on by Steve Bruce, who now has an injury list of eight players, including forwards Sone Aluko and Gaston Ramirez.

Had either of Bruce’s first-choice attackers been on you sense Hull may have snatched this. In the 73rd minute Brady delivered an excellent cross than Ince failed to meet with any conviction. Never been one for headers it must be said.

Berahino was always the likeliest to break the deadlock. In the first half he sent a close-range shot wide, tested McGregor from further out, and wriggled his way into an opening before firing low to bring another save from the Hull goalkeeper.

But, as he explained after the fallout from his glum reaction to that FA Cup haul, goals are his occupation.

Twelve minutes from time it was job done.
