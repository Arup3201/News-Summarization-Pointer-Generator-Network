Arsenal might not have signed any big names this summer yet - but boss Arsene Wenger is certainly doing his best to get the word out about the Gunners.

The Frenchman is out in Brazil at the World Cup as a pundit for television in his homeland and has been spotted sporting an array of Arsenal-branded clothing during the trip.

But the North London club's new kit sponsors Puma might not be so happy - with Wenger so far picking out the club's old Nike gear from his wardrobe.

He was spotted at dinner with football royalty in the form of Fabio Cannavaro, Christian Vieri and Juan Sebastian Veron in an Arsenal Nike training top, and showed off the club crest on his trousers during a television interview too.

Some Gunners fans have grown frustrated at Wenger's media duties while their club fail to produce the goods in the transfer market - although Chile's Alexis Sanchez is rumoured to be on his way.

Wenger, though, can still watch seven of his club charges in Brazil - even at the quarter final stage. Per Mertesacker, Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski (Germany), Laurent Koscielny, Olivier Giroud (France) Thomas Vermaelen (Belgium) and Joel Campbell (Costa Rica) are all still in the competition.
