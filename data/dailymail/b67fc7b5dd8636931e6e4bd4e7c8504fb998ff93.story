A video recorded nearly five years ago showing an African-American woman reacting to seeing an African-American portraying a Disney princess re-emerged this week and has people reaching for the tissues. 

The touching video shows comedian GloZell Green watching the parade at Disneyland as some of the princess strutted by.

'Here comes the black princess,' she says when she spots the African-American princess.

Green tells the princess how nice it is to meet her. The princess responds in-kind and then proceeds to continue on the parade route.

That's when Green burst into tears.

'That was the black princess,' she says into the camera. 'I'm so happy to meet her because when I went to Disney as a child there was no black people - even in the parades. None less a princess.'

The person who recently posted the video on Tumblr describes the implications the video has in terms of cultural representation in American culture.
