Gwyneth Paltrow has won numerous awards for her acting, but speaking apparently came with some difficulty Thursday with President Barack Obama standing beside her.

'You're so handsome that I can't speak properly,' the actress, singer and food writer gushed after introducing Obama to several hundred supporters seated on white fold-out chairs in the lush backyard of her home in the movie star haven of Brentwood, a neighborhood in Los Angeles.

In a not-so-subtle reference to her 'conscious uncoupling' earlier this year from husband Chris Martin, Paltrow said it was a 'profound honor' to have Obama in the home she shares with Apple and Moses, her two children with the Coldplay lead vocalist.

Paltrow hosted a reception and dinner benefiting the Democratic Party that marked the start of a three-day, California fundraising swing for Obama. 

He is scheduled to attend three other Democratic National Committee fundraisers in Los Angeles and San Francisco before returning to Washington on Saturday.

Tickets to the reception at Paltrow's home started at $1,000, while dinner tickets cost a minimum of $15,000.

Actors Julia Roberts and Bradley Whitford were among those attending.

In a brief introduction punctuated by 'ums,' Paltrow declared herself to be one of Obama's biggest fans and said he's an 'incredible role model.'

'I am one of your biggest fans, if not the biggest, and have been since the inception of your campaign,' she said, adding that she thinks both of his campaigns and his presidency will be one of the most important and most scrutinized of all time.

Paltrow noted the approaching Nov. 4 midterm elections in which Democratic control of the Senate is at risk. 

She called it a 'critical time' for Democrats and seemed to urge everyone to vote. 'It would be wonderful if we were able to give this man all of the power that he needs to pass the things that he needs to pass,' she said. 

Paltrow mentioned equal rights for women in the workplace, an issue 'very important to me as a working mother,' said the actress, who Forbes says makes around $19 million per year. 

The GOOP entrepreneur, it appears, did not learn her lesson from the last time she invoked working mothers, saying in 2013:

'I think it's different when you have an office job, because it's routine and, you know, you can do all the stuff in the morning and then you come home in the evening.'

The comments sparked an instant internet backlash culminating in 'A working mom’s open letter to Gwyneth' in the New York Post.

Gwyneth Paltrow has had her Hollywood home targeted with a series of anti-Obama posters ahead of a fundraiser that the actress is holding for the president on Thursday evening

Paltrow also touched on investments in sustainable energy and 'everything green' before commenting on Obama's looks.

'I'm taking her to the next event,' Obama quipped when it was his turn to speak.

He also thanked Paltrow and her kids for 'letting us crash your house' before launching into, according to a White House pool report, his standard fundraiser speech.

However he was sure to mention Paltrow's famously named son and daughter in a bit about Ebola.

'I want to assure everybody that the likelihood of an epidemic here in the United States is extraordinarily small, but there’s a humanitarian crisis that’s happening right now in West Africa where children not much older, and in some cases younger than, Apple and Moses are dying on the streets alone.'

As focus of the event, Obama managed to draw much of the pre-show ire on Thursday.

The president's presence in Los Angeles wreaked havoc on the city's all-important vehicular traffic. 

And Paltrow had her Hollywood home targeted with a series of anti-Obama posters ahead of the fundraiser.

The actress got full view of the posters as she arrived home on Wednesday. They’ve been plastered to electricity boxes and hung over the road for everyone to see around her upscale neighborhood of Mandeville anyon, Brentwood.

Another poster depicts an image of the President that has been ripped down the middle to separate him from the American flag and features Gwyneth's infamous phrase 'conscious uncoupling' on it.
