A serial car criminal was today jailed for life for murdering a brave elderly man who was crushed to death while trying to stop his 4x4 being stolen.

James Simpson, 76, was left dying in the street after thief Christopher Grenfell, 25, took his Land Rover Discovery from his driveway and reversed over him.

The incident, which was witnessed by Mr Simpson's wife of 46 years, Minnie, happened outside the pensioner's home in Ashgill, South Lanarkshire.

'Deplorable': Car thief Christopher Grenfell (left) has been jailed for life for murdering James Simpson (right), who was crushed to death as he tried to stop his Land Rover Discovery being stolen from outside his home

Dumped: Grenfell abandoned Mr Simpson's Land Rover in Crossford, Lanarkshire, after killing the pensioner outside his home

Grenfell claimed that Mr Simpson fell under under the Land Rover, but he was convicted of murder after a trial at the High Court in Glasgow.

Judge Lord Burns jailed him for life and recommended that he serve a minimum of 17 years.

Grenfell was also convicted of breaking into Mr Simpson’s house to steal the car keys and, along with a second man, 24-year-old William MacVicar, was found guilty of car theft.

The pair stole Mr Simpson’s 4x4 from outside his home on November 29 last year.

Mrs Simpson described what happened next while giving evidence to the jury.

'My husband immediately got up - he was a very fast mover - and he shouted "They are stealing the car",' she said.

'He was down the stairs in about a second flat.'

Mr Simpson pulled open the door of his 4x4 and tried to drag Grenfell out as his wife begged him to come back indoors.

Courageous: James Simpson, pictured with his wife of 46 years, Minnie, reacted bravely when he realised his Land Rover was being stolen, pulling open the door of the vehicle and trying to drag the thief out. But he was unable to stop Grenfell getting away, and was crushed when the thug reversed over him

'A great relief went through me when I saw the car then going up the road,' Mrs Simpson said.

'I was then very astonished when the car stopped suddenly and I went into despair when it reversed back to where it had been.'

Mrs Simpson said her husband was 'whirled around and around' by the force and added: 'I shouted stop, but no one was listening.'

The Land Rover 'went like a bullet' away from the scene before Mrs Simpson rushed to her husband's aid, the court heard.

'Devastated': James Simpson's wife Minnie, who witnessed the incident, said her husband was 'whirled around and around'

Mrs Simpson told the jury: 'I said "You will be alright, Jimmy", but he was not looking at me. He was just staring.

'I
was shouting "Help me somebody, help". My neighbour who is a doctor 
came out and took his pulse. I was there screaming and screaming.'

Mr Simpson suffered multiple rib fractures and collapsed lungs. His spine was also broken in two places.

Grenfell dumped the Land Rover in nearby Crossford, Lanarkshire, before being picked up by a friend.

He was eventually held for the murder on December 7 last year after a high-profile appeal to catch the killer.

He initially denied that he had been at the Simpsons' home and branded claims that he was in the Land Rover as 's****'.

During the trial, however, he accepted that he was responsible for the killing, although he told the jury that it was 'by accident'.

He described Mr Simpson losing his footing and said he looked out the open door of the Land Rover and did not see the pensioner.

He said he then heard screams and fled the scene because he 'panicked'.

Lord Burns told Grenfell that he 'deliberately' used Mr Simpson's car to 'inflict fatal and devastating' injuries.

The judge continued: 'His wife witnessed these terrible events in front of their house.

'She has had to relive these events in open court.

'The trauma to her and her family caused by your actions cannot be calculated.

'You fled the scene of this crime knowing that this elderly man must have been gravely injured and abandoned the car and threw away the keys.

'Your actions against him were deplorable and motivated by greed.

'No doubt they were also done in panic since you cannot have expected Mr Simpson to put up such vigorous resistance to your plan.'

Grenfell, of Larkhall, Lanarkshire, was banned from the road at the time of the murder after being convicted of dangerous driving.

Defence: Grenfell initially denied that he had been at the Simpsons' home, but he accepted responsibility for the killing when giving evidence during his trial

His criminal record also includes a string of road traffic offences and a conviction for assaulting a prison officer while behind bars.

Outside court, Mr Simpson's son James said: 'Christopher Grenfell decided to counter the actions of my father by committing the murder of a 76-year-old man when he had the clear option of simply driving away.

'In the wake of this choice, he not only left a man dying in the street, but also left his wife absolutely devastated.

'My mother was a happy, confident and independent woman. Now my mother is shattered, nervous and a lonely widow.'

He paid tribute to his father as a man 'filled with passion and compassion in equal measures'.

'He cared sincerely about people and would not hesitate to offer help and advice to anyone where he was in a position to help,' he said.

'He met life with a positive and unquestioning optimism.'
