Millions of people gazed up at a moonlit sky last night to witness an incredible astronomical phenomenon.

With cameras at the ready, sky watchers around the world were treated to the sight of a perigree moon, more commonly known as a supermoon.

One photographer in London was able to capture not only the stunning lunar surface, but also a mysterious-looking dark object as it floated by.

Photographer and Co-founder of group travel company The Flash Pack took these pictures of the moon around 11.30pm BST on Sunday night and was amazed to see a black object (ringed in red) flying from the right side to the left of the moon

Lee Thompson, photographer for group travel company The Flash Pack, took these pictures of the supermoon around 11.30pm BST last night.

‘I captured the image from my back garden in Brixton using an 800ml Canon lens,’ Mr Thompson told MailOnline.

‘At first I thought it was an aircraft as it was moving from right to left at the same sort of speed you’d expect from a plane.'

Mr Thompson added that he believes it may be some sort of satellite shown up by an unusually bright moon.

What is this mysterious object? Colin Stuart, an astronomer at Royal Observatory Greenwich, said at first sight it is plausible the dark object is the International Space Station. But he added, that if the image was from London, then it is unlikely it is the ISS

The supermoon is not the technical term for the full moon.

Astronomers call this phenomenon a 'perigee moon,' which describes the full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest point to Earth each year.

Perigee marks the closest point of a body as it orbits around Earth, while apogee marks the farthest point from Earth.

However, 
Dr Ilian Iliev, a reader in Astronomy at Sussex University claims the 
most likely explanation for the shadow is the International Space 
Station.

'The shape is slightly strange, however, there could be something docked to it at the moment,' he said.

Astronomy and physics writer, Colin Stuart, said at first sight it is plausible the dark object is the International Space Station.

But, he added, that if the image was taken from London, then it is unlikely it is the ISS.

‘Looking up ISS visibility for the UK in July shows that it doesn't make an appearance above London until the 19th,’ he said. 

He added the most logical explanation is that it is a satellite, which often pass in front of the moon.

A supermoon occurs when the moon is 30,000 
miles closer to Earth than the farthest point in its orbit making it look bigger and brighter than usual.

In fact, it is just an optical illusion caused by its position in the sky.

It is not that uncommon. Last year we had three although only one made the news. This year we will also have three supermoons with the next occurring on August 10 and then on September 9.

It is the 
one in August that moon fans are really looking forward to with glee and
 anticipation. The moon will be 863 miles closer than last night’s.

Geoff
 Chester at the US Naval Observatory said: ‘I guarantee that some folks 
will think it's the biggest moon they've ever seen if they catch it 
rising over a distant horizon, because the media will have told them to 
pay attention to this particular one.’

The ‘Moon Illusion’  is probably what will make people remember this coming set of full moons, more than the actual view of the Moon itself, he said.

The illusion occurs when the moon is near the horizon.

For reasons not fully understood by astronomers or psychologists, low-hanging moons look unnaturally large when they beam through trees, buildings and other foreground objects.

When the moon illusion amplifies a perigee moon, the swollen orb rising in the east at sunset can seem super indeed.

'There's a part of me that wishes that this 'super-Moon' moniker would just dry up and blow away, like the 'Blood-Moon' that accompanied the most recent lunar eclipse, because it tends to promulgate a lot of mis-information,' admits Dr Chester.

'However, if it gets people out and looking at the night sky and maybe hooks them into astronomy, then it's a good thing.'
