Anger: Jordan Graham (pictured with her deceased husband Cody Johnson) allegedly spoke about killing her mother and step-father in the weeks before she became a widow

The Montana bride accused of killing her new husband by pushing him off a cliff at Glacier National Park had spoken of killing her mother and stepfather in the weeks before her June wedding, federal prosecutors claimed in legal documents filed on Tuesday.

Prosecutors allege that 22-year-old Jordan Graham was unhappy in her new marriage and deliberately shoved her blindfolded husband of eight days off a rock ledge during an argument while hiking a steep trail on July 7.

She was indicted last month on charges of first- and second-degree murder in the death of Cody Johnson, 25. Her attorneys have insisted his death was an accident.

Prosecutors, in filings in U.S. District Court in Missoula, said they plan to produce evidence at next month's trial that Graham made statements about killing her mother, Lindel Rutledge, and stepfather about five weeks before Johnson plunged to his death.

They argued that Graham's remarks about killing her parents, made in the weeks before her wedding, would be used to 'negate innocent intent and demonstrate the likelihood that the defendant did an act with the requisite intent in the charged case,' according to legal documents filed late on Tuesday.

Prosecutors also notified the court that they intend to prove Graham lied about alleged abuse she suffered in previous romantic relationships, arguing that such fabrications provided key insights about her state of mind and credibility.

Graham told federal investigators that Johnson had 'tried to hold me down' during an argument at their home in the city of Kalispell just before the couple went for the hike at Glacier, court records show.

She said that when her husband 'tried to grab my arm and my jacket' during the dispute and that she acted in self-defense by pulling away even as she pushed him, according to legal documents filed by Graham's federal defenders.

Her attorneys have previously scolded prosecutors for labeling their client a sociopath and for theorizing that a cloth found near Johnson's body might have been used to blindfold him. Her lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday.

Prosecutors said in legal filings on Tuesday that an FBI forensic scientist who conducted tests on the material will testify at trial about 'the discovery of six human hairs embedded in the cloth.'

A U.S. judge in September ordered Graham released from jail, fitted with an electronic monitoring device and placed in the custody of her parents at their Kalispell home pending trial.

Earlier this month, Jordan Graham testified at her murder indictment that she instinctively pushed Cody Johnson away when he grabbed her arm, causing the July 7 fall.

She also alleged that an FBI agent improperly interviewed her and made her uncomfortable by touching her knee.

Graham, 22, and Johnson, 25, had been married for eight days when they argued over her doubts about the marriage, prosecutors said.

Graham has pleaded not guilty, and said she was only attempting to remove Johnson's arm - not push him off the cliff.

She repeated the claim on the stand on Friday that she was acting instinctively. She added that she felt uncomfortable in a July 16 interview with FBI Agent Stacey Smiedala, during which she dropped her previous claims that Johnson had driven off with friends.

Graham's attorney Michael Donahoe alleged in court filings that Agent Smiedala interrogated his client alone and unrecorded for nearly one and a half hours so that he could 'shape' her statement to get Graham to admit she acted not instinctively, but in the 'heat of passion', required to file manslaughter charges.

During that time, Agent Smiedala allegedly made her uncomfortable by sitting very close and touching her knee for extended periods of time, Graham testified.

A shorter statement of Graham's version of events was then recorded and the agent 'told me that I was in the clear, that I wouldn't be seeing him again, and that I was free to go', she said.Her recorded statements were later distorted in the criminal complaint, Mr Donahoe alleged.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Zeno Baucus said in court filings that Graham participated voluntarily, and that FBI agents conducted the interview and filed the complaint properly.
