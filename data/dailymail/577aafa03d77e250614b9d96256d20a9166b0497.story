The reason Education Minister Christopher Pyne called Clive Palmer’s senator-elect in Western Australia Zhenya ‘Dio’ Wang by the name 'Wong' has been explained after ABC journalist Leigh Sales asked Mr Wang the proper pronunciation of his name.

In Australia the WA Senator is known as Wang so when Mr Pyne appeared on the ABC 7.30 Report and called him Wong Ms Sales quickly picked him up on it.

But after speaking with Mr Wang she has admitted it was in fact her that was wrong.

Mr Wang told her his name was pronounced ‘Wong’ in spite of the Romanised spelling of his name using the 'a' vowel.

‘So Christopher Pyne was right and I was wrong,’ Ms Sales clarified.

On Tuesday night, Mr Pyne explained: 'Well some people pronounce it Wang, some people pronounce it Wong; it depends where you are on the spectrum. But if you wish to pick me up on that Leigh, that's a very small thing and I'm surprised you'd bother with it.’

‘Never the less, Dio and I are good friends and I will continue to try and get their support,' he replied to the quip.

Mr Pyne appeared on the 7.30 Report after his higher educations were rejected by senators on Tuesday.

Palmer United senators Dio Wang and Glenn Lazarus joined independents Jacqui Lambie and Nick Xenophon, as well as Labor and the Greens to defeat the Education Minister’s bill.

ABC journalist John Barron reported on Twitter that 'Senator Wang's office says in China is would be "Wong" but they use "Wang" to avoid confusion with Senator Penny Wong.'

Mr Pyne scolded Ms Sales, instructing her to study a bachelor of political science after being asked about the frequency of which he met with the crossbenchers and the quality of the relationships they shared.

The higher education reforms were rejected by the Senate on Tuesday night with a vote of 33-31

'I have met with some of the crossbenchers many, many times – in fact I've met with some of them six or seven or eight times, but I'm not going to go through the day-to-day machinations of how government works, Leigh,' he said. 

'You can go and study that at university if you wish to, in a bachelor of political science. The reality is that I'm working closely with the cross bench, I secured four of their votes today and I'll be back at it again tomorrow with a new reform bill.'

The higher education reforms, which include a reduction in government funding and permit universities to set their own fees, were rejected by the Senate on Tuesday night with a vote of 33-31.

Pyne was also forced to deny 'harassing' senators in order to get them to support his higher education reforms.

Palmer United Party Senator Glenn Lazarus accused the Education Minister of pestering him and others in a statement on Tuesday, saying he'd been 'inundated with text messages from Christopher Pyne' despite having never given him his mobile number.

But Mr Pyne dismissed the accusations, suggesting that the 'seven or eight' messages he'd sent Senator Lazarus were entirely acceptable and telling ABC's 7.30 Report that he would be 'happy to send him more'.

'Senator Lazarus is the only crossbench senator who has refused to meet with me to discuss these reforms, so the only avenue he's left to me to be able to communicate with him, besides letters, is SMS,' Mr Pyne told Ms Sales.

He then added: 'I hope you didn't mind the fact that I sent him a Christmas card today, Leigh, I'm sure he won't.'

'I would have sent him seven or eight texts and I'm happy to send him more texts.'

Mr Pyne claimed that Mr Lazarus told a reporter he was happy for the Education Minister to send him 'as many texts as he wanted' after the post had been published, saying: 'I'm as confused as the next person about Senator Lazarus wanting me to send him texts or not'.
