A career con man who posed as a music label executive to scam Miami hotels out of $600,000 in presidential suites, bottles of champagne and haute cuisine has been sentenced to five years.

It was just the latest con by James 'Jimmy' Sabatino, who has already served more than 15 years for scamming hotels across the U.S. and the U.K. and swindling a phone company out of millions - from inside his prison cell.

Among his latest schemes, he pleaded for lazy eye surgery from inside prison in August - and eventually convinced authorities to spend $247,000 of taxpayers' money on the operation.

On Tuesday, the 37-year-old appeared at his sentencing in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, where he was ordered to serve five years behind bars as well as three years of probation as part of a plea deal.

He had pleaded guilty to grand theft and fraud after his hotel spree between July and September 2013 - just weeks after he was released from federal prison, the Miami Herald reported. 

He has been ordered to repay the whopping $594,000 he owes hotels, including $400,000 to the downtown Miami Hilton and $140,000 to the Hilton Bentley South Beach. 

Throughout the scam, he posed as a music-label exec and checked himself, his entourage, girlfriends and wannabe stars into the four luxury hotels.

To score the rooms, he claimed he had launched the careers of Puff Daddy, Mark Wahlberg, the Notorious B.I.G. and Method Man, the Miami New Times reported.

High life: On his Instagram page, he shares numerous photos of him drinking expensive champagne in hotel

Fans: He also posed for photographs with girls, some of whom he apparently treated to expensive jewelry

While at the Bentley hotel, he convinced staff that he worked for Sony. He stayed at an ocean-facing suite while his entourage drank $100,000 in alcohol and racked up $74,000 in other costs before scarpering without paying the bill.

When cops found him, he had $50,000 worth of champagne in his car.

Photographs on his Instagram page show him posing with massive wads of cash and expensive jewelry, posing with scantily-clad women and driving luxury cars.

He also shares photographs of stars, including Jay-Z, as if he were hanging out with them.

Sabatino has pulled scams before, starting when he was just 17, when he was arrested after he posed as a Coca-Cola executive to get hotel rooms.

Then in 1995, he was given 262 free tickets to the Super Bowl by pretending to be a Blockbuster exec before he sold the tickets for $235,800. He was sentenced to two years in prison.

After he got out, 21-year-old Sabatino threw himself a $55,000 party at the Marriott Marquis in Times Square - but was arrested when he failed to pay the bill.

While out on bail, he fled to London, where he scored a free room at the Four Seasons by pretending to be a movie-studio exec - before he was sentenced to prison there.

He was deported to the U.S. after calling the FBI from  jail and threatening to kill President Clinton.

In that case, he was sentenced to four years in prison but two years into his sentence, he was charged with running a scam from prison that defrauded a phone company out of $3 million. He was sentenced to 11 more years.

Then in 2008, he fed the Los Angeles Times  fake FBI documents - which the newspaper printed - linking him to a 1994 assassination attempt on Tupac Shakur, the News Times reported.

He was finally released in May 2013 - just weeks before starting his hotel spending spree. 

Then in August, Sabatino underwent his corrective eye surgery while in Miami-Dade Corrections custody. That too, he claims, was a scam.

Luxury: In other images shared at the time, he ashowed off his Bentley ride and Rolex watches

All talk: He had previously served time for scamming a phone company out of millions and, when he was caught scamming a hotel in the U.K., he called the FBI saying he wanted to kill Clinton so he'd be extradited

'I kept saying I was having these headaches, and how can we make them stop?' Sabatino said. 'Next thing I know, they approved the surgery.' 

Sabatino had provided a referral letter from doctors claiming the lazy eye came from a stroke in 2013 - when the condition has affected him since he was a child, the Herald previously reported. 

He claims that the cost to taxpayers reached $247,000.

The judge in his case expressed her outrage on learning about the procedure, but Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office spokesman Ed Griffith said doctors told them the surgery was medically necessary.

The con man, who stands at 5ft 6 and 300 pounds, joked that he wonders if he can get officials to approve lap-band surgery next. 

The Herald noted that Sabatino's father once told a judge that his son's attention-seeking behavior came from him being abandoned by his mother as a child. 

Before his sentencing, he had repeatedly contacted the Herald and asked staff to publicize his upcoming sentencing. While there, he confirmed jailhouse interviews with several outlets.
