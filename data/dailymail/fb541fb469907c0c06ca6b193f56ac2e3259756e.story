A Russian billionaire who bought a New York City penthouse for his daughter for $88million is being sued by his estranged wife over the purchase.

The estranged wife of Dmitiri Rybolovlev claims the 6,700 square foot apartment was not bought for their daughter Ekaterina to live in while she attends school in New York as he had claimed.

'She does not attend school in New York,' Elena Rybolovleva said in papers filed today in Manhattan Supreme Court.

Her lawyer David Newman adds that the 
22-year-old would live in slightly more modest accommodation if she did 
attend school in the city.

The suit contends that fertiliser 
magnate Mr Rybolovlev, 45, - ranked the 100th richest man in the world by 
Forbes - actually bought the pad in a failed bid to hide his assets from
his wife of 24 years.

'That apartment is large enough to house her whole undergraduate class if she goes to school here,' Mr Newman said.

The lawyer claims Mr Rybolovlev bought the apartment through ‘a sham entity’ in order to keep his identity and actions secret.

Marc Salis, a lawyer who represented 
Rybolovlev on the purchase of the home, did not immediately respond to a
request for comment.

The purchase of the penthouse from 
former head of Citigroup Inc Sandford I.Weill and his wife Joan was the 
highest price ever paid for a New York residence.

The Wall Street Journal says the sale 
generated nearly $2.5 million in city and state taxes and the brokers' 
commission alone came to about $3.5million.

The previous record for real estate in Manhattan was $53million.

The ten-room apartment boasts wrap around terraces and its own gallery.

Elena Rybolovleva, also 45, said she 
had begun divorce proceedings in Switzerland in 2008 after 21 years of 
marriage, and that a Geneva court later imposed a freeze on some of her 
husband's assets.

Despite this, she said her husband has
been using marital property to buy a multitude of other assets through a
variety of trusts and limited liability companies, hoping to put those 
assets beyond her reach.

Mrs Rybolovleva said these assets 
include majority ownership in French soccer club AS Monaco, a $295 
million stake in Bank of Cyprus, and a $95 million Palm Beach, Florida 
home purchased from another tycoon, Donald Trump.

Mrs Rybolovleva is seeking a 
constructive trust over the penthouse 'to ensure that assets are 
available to satisfy any monetary judgment' she may be awarded in 
Switzerland. She has filed a similar lawsuit in Florida over the Palm 
Beach home.

Mr Rybolovlev is one of the small 
group of Russians who became fabulously wealthy during the post-Soviet 
privatization of the economy and are known as oligarchs. He is the 
former owner of fertilizer business Uralkali.

Architectural Digest ran a feature on the Manhattan pad. It describes the designers as 
making the apartment ceilings and windows as high as they could.

'The sweep of space they configured made possible a Versailles-like enfilade of grand rooms with views,' it said.

Sandy Weill and his wife Joan bought the apartment themselves for a then record $42.4million.

Mr Weill said when it went on the market that the proceeds would be donated to charity.

Miss Rybolovleva is following in the 
footsteps of Petra Ecclestone, who earlier this year bought the spelling
mansion, which was listed at a selling price of $150million - America's
most expensive home.

The 22-year-old British heiress is said to have bought it for a mere $85million.

Petra is the daughter of British Formula One exec Bernie Ecclestone, whose worth is estimated at $4 billion.
