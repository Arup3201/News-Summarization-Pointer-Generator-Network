Hollywood icon Audrey Hepburn once said 'it's a wonderful idea that others come first and you come second.'

Nowhere is this better embodied than by the deeds of Huang Yuanfeng, a southern-Chinese man who has sacrificed his life for the residents of an isolated village.

The 45-year-old suffers from debilitating liver cancer. But rather than funding the costly treatment for his disease which will give him the chance to live, Mr Huang has instead resolved to use his life-savings on building a road through the previously impassible mountains that lead into his home town of Xiaojiangtun.

Mr Huang hope his legacy will be renewed trade and tourism to the impoverished town, reports Global Times.

Mr Huang is often too weak to direct work on the road, so he sits on a deck chair and uses a walkie-talkie 

Xiaojiangtun sits on the far south of China, bordering Vietnam. For generations, locals have endured days of arduous trekking to get out of the village, which is hemmed in by towering rivers and cliffs.

Mr Huang moved from the village as a teenager and spent twenty years as a migrant worker in Guilin, a popular tourist destination. It was here he amassed his savings.

As was one of few locals to escape the severely remote village, he knows how vital the  road is for the locals.

'What could be more useful than a road that would give my fellow villagers the opportunities that I had?' Mr Huang told Mirror.

The four-kilometre-long Xiaojiangtun road, completed this month, steers through cliffs, forests and rivers to connect the town to a national highway.

Inspiring: Huang decided  he didn't want to 'waste' his money on expensive medicine, and decided to help his beloved hometown instead

Selfless: Mr Huang has spent $AU34,795.16 (170,000 yuan) on the project, almost the entirety of his life savings

Last May, Mr Huang was tragically diagnosed with liver cancer. Doctors advised he was unlikely to survive, even with costly medical treatment, so he resolved to use his savings on helping others.

'I had the choice of either wasting my money on attempting a cure pretty much everybody agreed wouldn't work, or spending the money on something really useful,' he told Mirror.

Mr Huang hired a team of workers last December and rented an excavating machine for the ambitious project.

He invested $AU34,795.16 (170,000 yuan) -almost the entirety of his life savings-but Huang told local media it was worth every penny.

'I built this road for the villagers who can now transport and sell products to the outside. It will also bring tourists to my hometown,' he said.

Despite being too weak to stand on his feet most of the time, Mr Huang oversaw the entire process, directing the workers from a chair as he took his medicine through eight hour  days.

In order to maintain his health, Mr Huang kept a package on hand filled with fruit, vegetables, a special herb drink and an array of medicine.

Thankfully, he did not have to brave the task alone: his father, wife and daughter have stood by Mr Huang throughout the selfless venture.

The 45-year-old has been hailed a hero: This Xiaojiangtun woman reportedly told the cameraman Mr Huang is 'really a great man!'

Huang's 21-year-old-daughter Tonghui even took a gap year from her scholarship at one of the country's most esteemed institutions-Guangxi University-to cook for her father and help him to take his medicine.

After two months of construction, the Xiaojiangtun road is complete, and Mr Huang has been hailed a hero.
