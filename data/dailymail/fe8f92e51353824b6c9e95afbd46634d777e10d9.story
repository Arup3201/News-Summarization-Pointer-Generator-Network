The racial ‘bias’ in police use of stop-and-search powers is much worse in rural parts of England than previously thought – with black people as much as twelve times more likely to be stopped than whites.

In 27 force areas, the true extent of the disproportionate use of so-called sus powers on black people has been revised upwards in new research by the equalities watchdog.

These include Dorset, where black people are a staggering twelve times more likely than whites to be stopped and searched by the police.

In Gloucestershire, they are nearly eight times more likely, in Wiltshire seven times and more than five times in Norfolk and Suffolk.

Overall, the Census figures showed lower numbers of black, mixed race and other ethnic minority groups were living in some rural areas. The extent of racial bias in the Met is a third lower than was thought

Several other forces have been shown to have much higher levels of racial bias include Warwickshire, Surrey, Devon and Cornwall, Kent and Hampshire, the Equality and Human Rights Commission report shows.

The new figures – which will be a major concern to ministers, officers and race campaigners – emerged after stop and search numbers were re-calculated with up-to-date population estimates from the 2011 Census.

In a report released yesterday, the 
Equality and Human Rights Commisssion compared figures for how many 
people in force areas in different ethnic groups with stop and search 
totals for 2010-11 and 2011-12.

Under Section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act officers can to stop and search someone if they have reasonable suspicion they are about to commit an offence.

Overall, the Census figues showed lower numbers of black, mixed race and other ethnic minority groups were living in some rural areas. By contrast, the numbers for urban areas are much higher.

As a result, researchers have recalculated the extent to which stops and searches are ‘disproportionate’ across England and Wales.

In Dorset, the size of the black population is 2,920 – less than half the earlier estimate of 7,480.

The old figures suggested 3.8 black people were stopped for every white person, compared to more than ten under the new calculation for 2011, and nearly 12 in the 2012 figures.

The extent of racial bias was found to be twice as high in West Mercia, and nearly twice as high in Sussex than previously thought.

The census also showed ethnic minority populations in urban areas were much higher.

That means urban forces, including the Metropolitan Police, West Midlands and Greater Manchester, have lower levels of racial bias, and search fewer black people as a proportion of the overall population.

The extent of racial bias in the Met is a third lower than was thought. The force carried out 471,336 – or 47 per cent – of the 1.1million stop and searches in England and Wales last year.

The Census showed there are 888,166 black people living in London, compared with 662, 396 under old Office for National Statistics (ONS) population projections. The estimate for people of mixed race has increased from 188,784 to 280,891.

These mean that rather than five black people being stopped and searched for every white person, the true figure is just over three. For people of mixed race, the proportion has nearly halved.

Across England and Wales, the revised figures show 6.5 stops of a black person for every white, instead of 7.5 under the previous population figures.

The extent of racial bias in stop and search was cited as a major factor in the causes for the 2011 riots by some commentators.

Home Secretary Theresa May is reining in stop and search powers after figures showed just 9 per cent of all stops led to an arrest.

In some parts of the country, the figure is as low as 3 per cent, raising huge question marks over whether the power is being used properly.

A spokesman for the Equality and Human Rights Commission said: ‘The change from ONS population estimates by ethnic group to 2011 Census data has revised population profiles for some police force areas with either relatively lower or higher ethnic minority populations.

‘This either increases or decreases estimates of race disproportionality.’

‘For example, Dorset, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire have higher figures for black/white disproportionality based on the Census estimates, while Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire have lower figures.’
