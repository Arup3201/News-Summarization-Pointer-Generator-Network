It sounds like an excuse a flustered groom might make after forgetting to order the wedding cake.

But newlyweds Matt, 35, and Kelly Gamblin, 32, had to make do with a consolation cake from a nearby supermarket after a dog ate theirs.

When they arrived at the marquee for their wedding reception at Skipwith Hall, Yorkshire, they found their beautiful red velvet cake had been demolished.

The red velvet wedding cake had been lovingly made by the bride's grandfather, Richard Varley

Newlyweds Matt, 35, and Kelly Gamblin, 32, had to make do with a consolation cake after a dog ate theirs

It had been lovingly made by the bride's grandfather, Richard Varley.

Initially the couple, who were together for five years before tying the knot at York Register Office, thought it had been damaged in transit.

But a trail of muddy paw prints across the dance floor alerted the couple that there could have been a canine thief.

Caterers then told the couple that they had had to shoo animals away from the tent earlier on in the day.

Mr Gamblin said: 'It was quite upsetting - we just couldn't understand what had happened. 

'When Richard showed us, I just thought it hadn't travelled well. 

The couple married at York Register Office and held their reception at Skipwith Hall, Yorkshire

'When he told me it had, we noticed the muddy paw prints on our dance floor and knew something had got it. 

'Then we saw the dog hairs all over the remaining half and it was quite clear.

'It didn't ruin our big day but we were gutted, as was Richard.

'There was probably someone who saw their pet with its face covered in icing and chocolate so they probably knows which dog it is.

'Kelly's mum pointed out that the cake would probably not have agreed with the canine thief.'

The couple are not sure exactly which dog ate the cake, as the thief had already disappeared.

But one of Mr Gamblin's friends said he had seen a black Labrador sniffing around.

There was a field out of the back of the marquee, so it is thought the culprit came from there.
