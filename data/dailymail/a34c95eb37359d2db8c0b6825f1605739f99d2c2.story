He was sent to space to alleviate the lonliness of astronauts.

But now Kirobo, a 13-inch tall Japanese humanoid has been aboard the International Space Station since the 10th August, has has his trip home delayed.

The tiny robot issued a heartfelt plea after it's 'friend', Koichi Wakata, returned to Earth in May.

I want to come home! Kirobo the robot is stranded aboard the International space Station indefinitely

He is based on the already existing kit called Robi and stands 13.4 inches tall and weighs 2.2lbs.

The language processing technology was contributed by Toyota and Kibo speaks in a synthesized voice.

A camera on his head is fitted with facial recognition software.

'I'm a little tired, so I think I'll rest a while, but I hope you'll look up at the sky sometimes and think of me,' he said in a video named 'Last message form the universe' posted to the project web site.

He was sent up with Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata and was able to talk to him in his own language which has been programmed into his circuits.

Kiboro is the work of the The Kibo Robot Project and his Japanese maker Dentsu after an appeal by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.

Kibo also keeps the rest of the crew amused, take pictures and update his Twitter account via a robot brother back on Earth as part of his mission to be a ‘social robot’.

was sent up with Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata and was able to talk to him in his own language - until he came back to Earth in May.

Kirobo was first unveiled at a press conference in Tokyo in June.

It was created by Tomotaka Takahashi in collaboration with the Research Center for 
Advanced Science and Technology, the University of Tokyo, Robo Garage 
and Toyota.

During the conference, project manager, Yorichika Nishijima said: 'Russia was the first to go outer space,
 the U.S. was the first to go to the moon, we want Japan to be the first
 to send a robot-astronaut to space that can communicate with humans.' 

Kirobo was launched into space on board the H-IIB Launch Vehicle No. 4 from Japan's Tanegashima Space Centre on 4 August.

It
 spent six days in orbit before crew aboard the International Space 
Station (ISS) used a robotic arm to remove it from the launch capsule.

Kibo was designed by renowned robot designer Tomotaka Takahashi whose earlier creation EVOLTA climbed a rope to the top of the Grand Canyon.

Kibo’s name was decided after more than 2,400 titles were submitted as part of a competition.

The robot has the distinction of being the first to speak in space.

At the start of its mission, it said: 'On August 21, 2013, a robot took one small step towards a brighter future for all. Good morning to everyone on Earth.

'This is Kirobo.

'I am the world's first talking robot astronaut.

'Nice to meet you.'

Kirobo continued that a backup crew member called Mirata was providing support on Earth before adding: 'Mirata, please stand by, I will now send a photo to Earth.'

Mirata is a similar make and model counterpart robot for Kirobo, based at Tokyo's Research Centre for Advanced Science and Technology.

It was first unveiled at a press conference in June last year.

Project manager, Yorichika Nishijima said: 'Russia was the first to go outer space,
 the U.S. was the first to go to the moon, we want Japan to be the first
 to send a robot-astronaut to space that can communicate with humans.'

The humanoid robot was created by Tomotaka Takahashi.

Wakata bid farewell to the unusual colleague on Tuesday, May 13, 2014.

It is a collaboration 
between advertising and PR company Dentsu, the Research Center for 
Advanced Science and Technology, the University of Tokyo, Robo Garage 
and Toyota Motor Corporation.

Kirobo was launched into space on board the H-IIB Launch Vehicle No. 4 from Japan's Tanegashima Space Centre on 4 August.

It spent six days in orbit before crew aboard the International Space Station (ISS) used a robotic arm to remove it from the launch capsule.

Takahashi said: 'By bringing a robot into space, the development of a symbiotic robot is
 expected to move along much faster.'
