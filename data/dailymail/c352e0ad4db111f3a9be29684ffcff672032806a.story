Listeners to BBC Radio 4's flagship Today programme awoke to the news on November 5 last year that immigrants who had come to Britain since 2000 had made a 'substantial' contribution to the country's public finances.

The findings of the study by University College London were also given huge coverage across the BBC's TV bulletins and its website.

BBC News Online said the authors, Professor Christian Dustmann and Dr Tommaso Frattini, had found that, rather than being a 'drain' on the Exchequer, the contribution of immigrants had been 'remarkably strong'.

Those from the European Economic Area (EEA) – the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein – were said to have made 'a particularly positive contribution in the decade up to 2011, contributing 34 per cent more in taxes than they received in benefits'. Immigrants from outside the area, meanwhile, were reported as having contributed 2 per cent more in taxes than they received in the same period.

Ever since the UCL report's publication, it has been treated as an article of faith by BBC presenters.

Not surprisingly, on Wednesday, as restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians working in the UK were lifted, Today presenter Sarah Montague uncritically trotted out its findings to suggest the public had nothing to fear from the prospect of a significant new influx.

Yet, as the Mail reported yesterday significant questions are now being asked about the accuracy of the academics' report, which other experts say contains 'schoolboy errors'.

Mervyn Stone, Emeritus Professor of Statistics at UCL, and statistician Nigel Williams of the Right-leaning think-tank Civitas suggested yesterday it was a 'fatally flawed' piece of work.

The failings they identify are complex, and relate to the methodology used to work out the impact migrants are having on housing and the transport network.

But the main problem, say Professor Stone and Mr Williams, is that the researchers started with the assumption that immigration was positive for Britain. They then made a series of other assumptions to prove that this belief – almost as an article of faith for many at the BBC over the years – was correct.

Helen Boaden, the BBC's former Head of News, has admitted that the Corporation's 'deep liberal bias' prevented it from reporting immigration properly

As Professor Stone observed: 'If any honest statistician had made the same painstaking but assumption-based calculations, the last word he/she would have used to describe the estimates is “precise” – unless exhaustion had affected judgment.

'Most of the underlying crude assumptions that the all-embracing approach has been obliged to make have not been subject to sensitivity tests that might have been made if the study had not been so obviously driven to make the case it claims to have made.'

Mr Williams, meanwhile, says the authors have deliberately overstated the benefits of EEA immigration – a particularly crucial finding, given the current debate over benefit tourism and the lifting of restrictions on 29million citizens of Romania and Bulgaria.

The UCL report found that, over an 11-year period, EEA migrants had made a net contribution to the economy of £22billion.

But Mr Williams said this conclusion was 'vulnerable' to even a small change in the assumptions used by the report's authors.

Dr Frattini graduated from Bocconi University, Milan, and is currently assistant professor at the Department of Economics of the University of Milan.

In 2003, ahead of Poland and seven other ex-Eastern Bloc countries joining the EU, Professor Dustmann was one of the authors of the notoriously inept Home Office study predicting that only between 5,000 and 13,000 migrants a year would come to the UK. In the end, more than one million arrived – the largest single wave of immigration to this country since 1066.

Indeed, the research was so disastrous that, ahead of Romanian and Bulgarian citizens getting full rights to work this week, the current government refused to repeat the exercise. Is it unfair to suggest that, having so spectacularly underestimated the number of Eastern Europeans who would arrive in the UK post-2004, Professor Dustmann might feel inclined to 'spin' their positive impact?

Certainly, if the BBC mentioned his central role in the flawed 2003 study, I must have missed it in the blanket coverage afforded to the more recent report in November.

But then why would BBC chiefs be critical of a study which confirmed their own long-held views?

There are many other reasons to question the UCL report.

For instance, it made no attempt to distinguish between the types of contribution made by migrants from the Eastern European countries which joined the EU in 2004, and 'old' member states such as France and Germany.

Highly skilled German engineers and French fashion designers and bankers were therefore lumped together with lower-paid migrants from Poland and elsewhere.

Unsurprisingly, this produced a positive – if flawed – conclusion.

Most egregiously, the UCL report appeared deliberately to downplay the conclusion that between 1995 and 2011 immigrants from outside the EEA claimed £100billion more in benefits than they paid in taxes. (This is, mostly, because they tended to have more children than native Britons.) In any case, focusing on the economic contribution made to the UK exchequer by migrants ignores other vital issues.

For example, much of the public's concern about mass immigration is based on how Britain's infrastructure and social fabric can cope with such a rapidly expanding population.

Meanwhile, Helen Boaden, the BBC's former Head of News, has admitted that the Corporation's 'deep liberal bias' prevented it from reporting immigration properly or taking lobby groups critical of mass immigration seriously.

It is true that it occasionally invites the respected former diplomat Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch, to give a brief alternative view, during which he will be challenged ferociously by the same presenters who treat the pro-immigration lobby with kid gloves.

As Dr David Green, director of Civitas, said yesterday: 'It is regrettable that even academics from an august institution like UCL can only see what they want to see.

'Yet again the BBC has failed in its duty to provide the public with impartial information.

'It has the resources to double-check conclusions based on statistical studies but instead seized on the conclusions to bolster its pre-existing prejudices.'

But, having given the UCL's study such prominent coverage at the time, you'd think Radio 4's Today programme would find time to report the serious problems highlighted by Civitas and Professor Stone yesterday.

Experience of BBC bias teaches us, however, that we should not hold our breath.
