Hundreds of Air France passengers were left frustrated and angry after their transatlantic flight diverted to Manchester Airport and they sat through a series of delays lasting up to 20 hours.

The Airbus A380 was flying from New York to Paris when it was forced to land because its flight crew was in danger of exceeding its maximum allowable hours if the plane continued to France, said the airline, which is now offering compensation.

The 440 passengers were left on the plane for more than six hours and an ambulance was required for one person - the reason for which is yet to be confirmed. 

Some British travellers say they were initially told they would have to continue on to Paris before getting another flight back to the UK.

Stuck: The 220 passengers were forced to stay seated on the plane for almost seven hours, according to some British travellers

Yesterday's wintry weather at New York's John F Kennedy International Airport led to a delayed departure and that pushed the plane's two pilots to the legal limit for flight times. 

Air France said: 'In order to comply with current European legislation on maximum working times for flight crew, the crew had to land at Manchester.' 

The plane's 440 passengers and 22 crew members were already more than six hours behind schedule when the plane departed New York at about 1:10am local time yesterday.

Flight AF007 landed in Manchester shortly after 11am local time and passengers were not allowed to exit the plane for the terminal building until around 6.30pm.

The Airbus A380 was forced to land at Manchester Airport because its crew had reached its flight time quota

Air France sent three additional Airbus aircraft – two A320s and an A318 – to pick up the passengers

One woman who lives just a couple of miles from Manchester Airport said she was eventually allowed to go home at 7pm - without her luggage.

She had been due to get a connecting flight back to Manchester from Paris.

The woman told the M.E.N: 'They wouldn't let us off the plane - I kept saying "I only live down the road, please can you let me off?"

'But there were other people on there flying to all over Europe from Paris.

'There was no food whatsoever. There were kids who hadn't eaten since leaving New York the previous day who had had no food.

'There was a lot of frustration on the flight, people were getting quite annoyed.

'Eventually, about 6pm they let us off into a secluded area near departures and 50 Burger King burgers were sent down.

'About 13 of us who live in the UK refused to get on the later flight to Paris so eventually they let us go, but our bags had to go on the original plane and I am still waiting to get my luggage back.' 

Medical emergency: An ambulance was seen arriving at the plane as passengers were finally allowed to leave for the terminal

Passengers complained about a lack of information and compensation while they were in Manchester

Exhausted passengers who weren't from the UK were forced to wait inside the terminal for more than 12 hours before they boarded one of three rescue flights.

They were unable to fly to France on the A380 that landed in Manchester because it experienced a cabin pressure problem and was unable to take-off, the airline said. 

Air France sent three additional Airbus aircraft – two A320s and an A318 – to pick up the passengers and fly them to Paris.

Many vented their frustration on Twitter, calling it ‘an awful experience’ and ‘the worst flight experience of my life’. 

Passenger Mael Tannou tweeted a photo that showed dozens of passengers waiting at the gate during a delay that lasted more than 12 hours. 

Passenger Didier Bodel complained about a lack of information from Air France and told French news network BFMTV that passengers became angry as they waited at Manchester Airport.

A Twitter user snapped this photo as the Air France plane made its final approach to Manchester Airport

He said the passenger list included three unaccompanied minors, who were without supervision and became upset.

'These children are crying. People are crazy mad,' he told BFMTV.

Another passenger, Joe Ze, tweeted: 'Passengers waiting w/dignity despite 18hrs stuck btw JFK&CDG no food no rest. How will @airfrance compensate?' 

French politician Bruno Le Maire was also on board after visiting New York, where he was photographed meeting with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

It is understood delays were made worse when a passenger fell ill, the Manchester Evening News reported. 

An Air France spokesperson told BFMTV that the decision to divert to Manchester was the best solution, despite the inconvenience for passengers.

The airline said in a statement: 'Air France fully understands that its customers are frustrated at this situation.

Some passengers were stranded in Manchester for more than 12 hours before a rescue flight arrived

'Throughout these incidents, Air France has done everything it could to limit the inconvenience while ensuring that passengers and crew remain safe.

'Air France will very soon be contacting passengers to offer them compensation. This will be addressed as a matter of priority.'

An airline spokeswoman told MailOnline Travel that the compensation amount has not been determined.

The French carrier's Airbus A380 fleet is configured to seat a maximum of 516 passengers in first, business and economy classes.
