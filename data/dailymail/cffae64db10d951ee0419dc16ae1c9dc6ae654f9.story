Two members of the jailed Russian protest punk band Pussy Riot have vowed to set up a human rights organisation.

Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alekhina were granted amnesty on Monday, two months short of their scheduled release.

The move has been seen as the Kremlin's attempt to soothe criticism of Russia's human rights record ahead of the February Winter Olympics in Sochi.

Alekhina flew into the eastern Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk early Tuesday to be reunited with Tolokonnikova.

They have said the amnesty and their release was a publicity stunt by the Kremlin ahead of the Olympics. Tolokonnikova has also called for a boycott of the Olympics.

Alekhina, still dressed in a dark green prison jacket, hugged Tolokonnikova and then shook hands.

The pair have announced plans to set up a human rights organisation, after being sentenced to two years in prison for their cathedral protest

Both women reiterated that they would like to focus their future work on helping prisoners, and that they will discuss setting up a human rights organisation.

The band's third member, Yekaterina Samutsevich, was released on suspended sentence shortly after the three were found guilty of hooliganism and sentenced to two years in prison in 2012 for their protest at Christ the Savior Cathedral in Moscow.

The women have denied the accusations that they were driven by hatred of religion, and said their performance was aimed at raising concern about the close ties between the church and state.

Russian parliament passed the amnesty bill last week, allowing the release of thousands of inmates, including the two Pussy Riot members.
