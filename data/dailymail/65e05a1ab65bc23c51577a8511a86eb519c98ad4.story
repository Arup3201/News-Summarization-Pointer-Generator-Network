The greatest talent in the game can rescue a performance with one game-changing flick of their boot on the edge of the area.

Raheem Sterling had kept an expectant Wembley audience waiting for 72 minutes for the sweetest of touches to steer the ball into path of Danny Welbeck to score England’s third. It saved the teenager.

Until then he had drifted in and out of this game, trying to find his rhythm as this England team lurched between ordinary and average.

Recalled to the team after complaining of fatigue before last month’s victory over Estonia, he had begun this Euro 2016 qualifier in a tailor-made role at the tip of the diamond.

By the time he set up Welbeck’s second against Slovenia, Sterling had been switched to play right midfield. At this stage of his development he looks a far better bet out there.

To play off the two main strikers requires a player who will take responsibility for making things happen in the final third of the field.

Think Diego Maradona, Zinedine Zidane or Gheorghe Hagi because this is the type of company Sterling is trying to get into.

These guys took responsibility for their national teams and everything was channelled through them.

Sterling is still young, learning to combine his football at the highest level for club and country. He deserves and needs time.

To preserve his talent, to keep this kid fresh, the England forward needs some protection ahead of Tuesday’s blood and thunder friendly in Scotland at Celtic Park.

In the same way that Hodgson rested Calum Chambers, who has already played 19 times for club and country this season, from this Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia, he must consider Sterling’s best interests.

This clash with Slovenia was his 21st appearance of the season and there is a danger that he will soon be dropping deep into the red zone. It may be that he is there already.

We know he has the touches, the ability to pick a ball out of the sky and trap it with either foot for Liverpool and England.

His back heel to Welbeck in the 28th minute was the highlight of the first half, a delayed touch that Slovenia’s defence was impossible to read.

After the break he did a decent job of chasing down an attempted clearance from the Slovenia defence in the move that led to England’s second goal 66 minutes into this mediocre performance by the national team.

Hodgson’s decision to send him wide was a sensible decision, something the head coach can always fall back on as Sterling continues his football education.

There were a couple of loose touches at the start of the half but he, like the rest of this England team, perked up after Jordan Henderson’s 57th minute own goal.

When Sterling set up Welbeck’s second from the edge of the Slovenia penalty area with that neat first touch, his work for the night was done.

Hodgson sent for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, replacing the Liverpool forward for the final few minutes of this 3-1 victory against Slovenia.

At the final whistle they replayed the move that led to Sterling’s neat touch for Welbeck to score his second of the game on the giant screens behind each goal.

It safe to say that no-one will ever tire of watching that.
