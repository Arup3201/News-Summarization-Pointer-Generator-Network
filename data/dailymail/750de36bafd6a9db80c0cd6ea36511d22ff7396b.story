Could this spell the end of unsightly underarm sweat patches? A better relationship between your new carpet and your dinner parties?

For messy chefs in Australian kitchens at least, the latest in 'intelligent' fabrics could mean a much lighter wash load.

An Australian start-up company has created 'hydrophobic' chef jackets and aprons that repel almost any liquid, including red wine and oil. Not even sweat will stick.

Off a duck's back: The new 'hydrophobic' chef jackets repels water, wine and oil.

'As a chef I find it really difficult to keep my chef jacket white, and we like our jackets white for obvious professional reasons,' says Adrian Li, previous MasterChef Australia mentor and co-founder of Fabricor.

'There's nothing currently on the market which helps this apart from buying new jackets and washing them every day. So we decided to create a new range of chef jackets using nanotechnology that makes it water repellent and stain-proof.'

Fabricor says its garments are not made with sprays which often contain carcinogenic chemicals. The hydrophobic properties are locked into the weave of the fabric.

The nanotechnology works by modifying the fabric molecules; attaching hydrophobic ‘whiskers’ to the fibres which makes liquids bead-up and roll off the fabric surface.The liquid that is repelled carries particles of dirt off with it, making it essentially self-cleaning.

Fabricor has set up a Kickstarter fund to launch its products and says it hopes to move towards making similar stain-free garments for the medical industry in the future, including, medical garbs, nurses uniforms and lab coats. The Chef's jackets currently sell for $90 and the aprons from $30.

Fabricor's chef whites are just the latest in intelligent nanotechnology fabric design in Australia.

Last month, Melbourne clothing label Threadsmiths patented a 100% cotton waterproof T-shirt with similar technology. It too, was created without the use of harmful chemicals seen in many hydrophobic sprays in the U.S.

'The Cavalier shirt contains no aerosol applications and no dangerous chemicals, and is completely safe to wear - as a shirt should be,' says Threadsmith's Lewis Pitchford. 'Most people are pretty amazed when they see it.'

And just like Fabricor, Threadsmith draws its inspiration from nature. The unsoak-able tees, says the company, 'emulate the natural hydrophobic properties of the lotus leaf.'
