The Iowa Supreme Court says a leading chiropractic college must make accommodations to allow a blind student to pursue a degree.

The court ruled 5-2 on Friday that Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport must readmit Aaron Cannon and allow him to use an assistant to interpret X-rays and other medical images.

The college had argued that accommodation wasn't feasible, and that vision was a requirement for a degree because reading X-rays is critical for the profession.

But Justice Daryl Hecht found that Cannon's accommodation was reasonable, noting that blind students had previously graduated from Palmer.

He noted that 20 percent or more of chiropractors do not have the ability to take radiographs in their office.

The college noted that several legally blind students have graduated in the past, The Quad-City Times reports.

'Palmer
 provides assistance to students with documented disabilities through 
our Student Disability Services program,' the statement read. 'Reasonable academic accommodations are designed to provide equal 
opportunity for students with disabilities, and may include such things 
as use of a private testing room, sign language interpreters and other 
accommodations.'

College representatives added no appeal is planned.

Dissenting Justice Thomas Waterman said the decision 'elevates political correctness over common sense.'
