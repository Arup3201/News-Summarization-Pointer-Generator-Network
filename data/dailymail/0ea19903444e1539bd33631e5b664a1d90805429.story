A 19th century 'autograph book' - comparable to a modern yearbook - has been unearthed, offering us a glimpse into what life was like for a 14-year-old girl living in 1892.

Shane Kent, 18, from Milibrae, California, found the book in a box of his great, great grandmother Agnes Nevin's possessions and posted it to Reddit. It contains life advice and nuggets of wisdom for Agnes in the form of handwritten notes from her friends and relatives, dated between 1892 and 1893.

'Take my advice and married be, Before you are over twenty-three,' one entry reads - one of several marriage mentions - signed by a man called Charley Righter on May 15, 1893, from Livermore, California.

Priorities: A yearbook dating back to 1982-1983, belonging to a then-14-year-old girl, Agnes Nevin, has been unearthed, with advice including, 'Take my advice and married be, Before you are over twenty-three' (pictured)

It seems Agnes didn't take the advice of Charley, whoever he was, to tie the knot before she was 23. According to a document uncovered by her great, great grandson Shane, she didn't marry until October 3, 1906, when she would have been 28.

'Agnes is your name, Single is your station, Happy be the little man, That makes the alteration,' wrote another friend, who signed her name, 'Mary R.'

The 'happy little man' that Agnes would marry 14 years after she received the autograph book turned out to be Frank M. McCormick, then 33, from Livermore. 

Little is known about their lives together, but the couple had two sons; one born in 1909, when Frank was 36 and Agnes was 31, and another four years later in 1913.

Fragile: Books such as the one belonging to Agnes, who died a widow in 1957 when she was 79, (pictured) were known as 'autograph books' and contained notes and pearls of wisdom from friends and relatives

Ignored advice: According to a document uncovered by her great, great grandson Shane, Agnes didn't marry before she was 23, she waited until she was 28, and wed Frank McCormick on October 3, 1906

Words of warning: 'Dear Agnes, Let your life be like a snow-flake, which leaves a mark but not a stain,' offered another friend, Helen Seller, seemingly advising Agnes to watch her reputation (pictured)

'Cousin Agnes, When you get married, And live up stairs, Don't get proud, And put on airs,' wrote M McManus, another acquaintance fond of advice that rhymes.

'Dear Agnes, Let your life be like a snow-flake, which leaves a mark but not a stain,' offered another friend, Helen Seller, seemingly advising Agnes to watch her reputation.

Her brothers made no mention of a future husband, but instead pointed to the importance of friends as being key to a happy future.

Agnes' brother George Nevin wrote in 1892: 'Dear Sister, May your pathway through life led [sic] you into fields of happiness, Where none but friends sincere await, To welcome you.'

One woman, Ana Phillips, concurred, but added another of life's great joys. 

'Next to acquiring good friends, the best acquaintance is that of good books. Your loving friend,' she wrote.

Sage advice: 'True worth is in being, Not seeming In doing each day that goes by, Some little good - not in dreaming, Of great things to do by and by,' wrote Agnes' 'True Friend, Gracie' (pictured)

Perhaps the most thoughtful and in-depth entry came from Agnes' 'True Friend, Gracie.'

'True worth is in being, Not seeming In doing each day that goes by, Some little good - not in dreaming, Of great things to do by and by,' she offered, essentially advising Agnes to put her money where her mouth is, and to actually do 'good' rather than aspire to be good.

Agnes and her husband Frank appear to have stayed together until their deaths, Frank in 1952 when he was 79, and Agnes five years later, when she was also 79. 

The couple would have shared their lives through World War I and II, the Great Depression, and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima; as well as the invention of airplanes, radios, and shortly before they died, Bikinis and LEGO.
