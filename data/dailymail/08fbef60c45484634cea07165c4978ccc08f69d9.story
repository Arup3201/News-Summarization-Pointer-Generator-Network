Memorabilia belonging to hero British Spitfire pilot Flight Lieutenant Bob Poulton, pictured, who battled German Messerschmidts during the Battle of Britain in 1940 is due to be auctioned next month

A hero Spitfire pilot whose family were told he had been killed during World War 2 was actually in a POW camp - where he learned to paint, write poetry and kept a journal of his daily meals.

Flight Lieutenant Bob Poulton was forced to parachute out of his cockpit as he fought with German fighter planes in 1944.

British military officials informed his wife by telegram that the highly-decorated officer was dead and the family immediately went into mourning.

But Bob had survived the leap and after he was found by the Germans with a broken leg he was taken to the notorious Stalig Luft 1 prisoner of war camp.

During the next twelve months his family in Britain were distraught - while Bob made the most of his time in captivity in the camp in north Germany.

He compiled a journal of his daily life listing every meal he had - including pancakes, toast, butter, coffee, spam, boiled potatoes, carrots, jam and lettuce.

But he also began producing dozens of intricate pencil pictures - including sketches of planes flying overhead, watchtowers and fellow prisoners.

Bob, of Liskeard, Cornwall, also began writing poems about his time at the camp which he kept throughout his incarceration.

He was eventually released from the camp and returned home - to his overjoyed wife who had spent a year in grief.

Bob was able to return home after Swiss officials brokered a deal for him to be exchanged with two German prisoners held in Britain.

He was in fact alive in a POW camp where he learned to paint and write poetry and began keeping this journal of what food he ate and what the weather was like

Now a collection of memorabilia, including Flight Lieutenant Poulton's medals (pictured) are to be auctioned by his family

A collection of all his memorabilia including his medals, the telegram to his wife, his journal, pictures and poems are now being auctioned by the family.

Bob’s son Jeremy, 51, of Caerleon, South Wales, said: 'The family had been told he was dead and obviously when he returned they were delighted.

'But he had clearly made the best of his time and drew pictures and wrote poems. Looking at the journal the food didn’t sound to bad either.

Among the lots on offer at auction is this telegram addressed to the wife of Poulton falsely informing her of his death. The pair were reunited a year later when he was released and came home

'He did say the camp was cold but he didn’t complain about it. He wasn’t tortured because they knew he didn’t have information.'

Bob was born in Guilford, Surrey, in 1918, and was originally sent to the London Orphan School in Watford.

In 1938 he joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve sharing a room with James Edgar Johnson, who later became the RAF’s best flying ace.

Bob later became a top Spitfire pilot who won medals after downing four of the Nazi’s best Messerschmidt during the Battle of Britain in 1940.

He was forced to parachute into German hands in March 1944 and he was taken to a Nazi interrogation centre and then Stalig Luft 1.

Jeremy said his father was piloting a Spitfire escorting bombers on a raid over Fruges, Northern France, in 1944, when his plane’s engine started to overheat.

He said: 'He turned to head back towards the coast, planning to bail out over the sea.

'But he had to parachute out at 800ft into a ploughed field.

'His leg got caught between his seat and his cockpit which left him with horrendous scars. And he broke his leg on impact.

'The Germans patched him up but his right leg didn’t heal properly and, until the day he died, it was one inch shorter than his left. He always had a limp.'

Bob returned to his delighted wife Nancy in 1945 but sadly she later died of polio. He had son Jeremy with his second wife Anne.

As well as drawing, Flight Lieutenant Poulton learned how to write poems, including this one, pictured, called Lest We Forget

His papers and medals will go under the hammer at Plymouth Auction Rooms on November 21 and are expected to fetch between £8,000 and £10,000.

His medals include the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Battle of Britain Clasp, awarded to only 3,000 men.

There is also a poignant album of photographs from 1939 to 1945, tracing his career and life from pets to colleagues.

Auctioneer Paul Keen said: 'Bob Poulton was a remarkably brave man and we are privileged to handle and sell one of the finest sets of medals we have seen over the last 20 years.'

Bob went on to be an air traffic controller for the RAF until he was 50, when he passed exams to do the same job at civilian airfields.

He died, aged 79, at his home in Liskeard, Cornwall in 1998, leaving second wife, Anne who died last year, aged 86.

Bob also left his three children with Nancy; Sally, 60, Penny, 65, and his now late son Anthony, 59. As well as Jeremy, Bob and Anne had a daughter, Amanda, 55.

He had grandchildren and great-grandchildren, one of them named Nancy after his first wife.
