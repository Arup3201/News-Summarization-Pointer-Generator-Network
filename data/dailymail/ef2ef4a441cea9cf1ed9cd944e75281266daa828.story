They may be two of the world's most famous sisters but Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie are rarely pictured together.

However, the daughters of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York, put on a united front today as they joined the rest of the Royal family at Ascot.

Princess Beatrice, 25, wore an elegant teal dress by British 
designer Suzannah and a hat by top milliner Sarah Cant and 25-year-old Princess 
Eugenie looked fresh and pretty in a neat beige trench coat and a hat 
by one of her favourite milliners, Nerida Fraiman.

Sister sister: Princess's Beatrice and Eugenie arrived together on the opening day of Royal Ascot looking chic, as always

The Royal siblings were last seen together last month, when they joined Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas for a night out at exclusive member's club, Annabel's.

Other than that, they usually attend Royal engagements separately, perhaps to break up their duties between them.

The duo both spend a lot of time with their respective boyfriends but they appear to share a lot of friends, including their cousin's ex Cressida, as well as socialites such as Holly Branson and Cara and Poppy Delevingne.

The two young Princesses were joined by practically the whole royal family today.

From the 
Queen's love of racing to Prince Harry's penchant for polo, there's no 
shortage of royal fans of all things equestrian - and Royal Ascot saw 
nearly all of them turn out for the opening day of racing action.

Friendship group: The sisters have a lot of mutual friends but are more often spotted hanging out with their respective boyfriends

Trendy: Princess Eugenie has been showcasing a more sophisticated dress sense in recent months

Fresh
 from a fuss-free appearance at the Order of the Garter service 
yesterday, the Queen beamed and waved at the cheering crowds as she was 
driven down the racecourse.

Joining
 the Queen, who was chic in a blue suit by Angela Kelly, was the Duke of
 Edinburgh, who missed last year's event due to illness, the Duchess of 
Cornwall, who was radiant in a silk ice blue suit, and the Prince of 
Wales who looked dapper in morning dress.

Also arriving with the royal party was 
Prince Harry, who looked more than ready for a good time, and new mother
 Zara Tindall who sported an enormous floral hat and was spotted giving 
her handsome cousin a big kiss on the cheek.

Completing the group was the Princess 
Royal, who looked lovely in brown, Prince Andrew and a glamorous Sophie 
Wessex who, like the Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall, chose ice blue.

Family moment: The royal party, including Princess Eugenie, Princess Beatrice and Zara Philips, arrived earlier today
