The nail salon business is booming in the U.S., with more of us indulging in regular claw-preening sessions than ever before, but have you ever wondered why so many of these salons are Vietnamese?

NailedIt, a new documentary which tells the story of Vietnamese families who started off as refugees during the 1970s in America, reveals how they changed the face of the country's nail industry.

As well as the surprising revelation that Hollywood Golden Age actress Tippi Hedren, now 84, played a key role in the industry's humble beginnings, NailedIt also explores current issues from race and discrimination to the toxic fumes faced by the Vietnamese nail technicians on a daily basis.

'NailedIt is about the impact the Vietnamese have had on this multi-billion dollar industry and the diverse culture of nails itself,' explains filmmaker Adele Pham, based in Brooklyn, New York, in the film's IndieGoGo trailer.

It is a little-known fact that Tippi Hedren, a long-time philanthropist, unwittingly sparked the beginning of the industry in 1975, while aiding the thousands of Vietnamese refugees who had fled their country after the Fall of Saigon in 1975, to start new lives in the U.S.

'What we tried to do was help them assimilate,' she says. Ms Hedren saw a gap in the market amid the rich and glamorous Hollywood women she mixed with, and set about getting these refugees trained by her manicurist so they could open their own salons.

History lesson: The talent spread and demand grew for skilled Vietnamese nail technicians, who now dominate almost half of the entire U.S. nail salon industry (pictured, Ms Hedren, back right and the refugees she trained)

One of the reasons the industry took off for the mass-market in the way that it did, was the sudden abundance of skilled Vietnamese nail technicians, who made nail salons around the country more affordable.

'The film presents a long overdue cast of first and second generation Vietnamese, who redefined the stereotypical nail shop Asian'

The fact that the job doesn't require workers to speak much English has also been cited as an advantage for workers, especially for the first generation of immigrants, who had never spoken another language.

NailedIt also examines the occasional friction between Vietnamese-owned nail salons and African American customers, and explores some of the health concerns employees face, many related to the toxic fumes they are subjected to daily.

'The film presents a long overdue cast of first and second generation Vietnamese, who redefined the stereotypical nail shop Asian,' says Ms Pham, who is currently raising funds to complete the documentary.
