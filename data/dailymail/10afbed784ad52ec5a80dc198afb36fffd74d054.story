A judge has accused prosecutors of sparking a 'serious miscarriage of justice' after he was unable to give two violent thugs the longer prison sentences he says they deserve.

Judge Nicholas Coleman made the comments while sentencing Ricky Fuller, 29, and Aaron Ellwood, 31, at Norwich Crown Court yesterday, after they admitted smashing the jaw of tattoo artist Dan Tidd.

Judge Coleman branded the prosecution's decision to accept lesser pleas than the original GBH with intent charges 'manifestly flawed', when they dramatically reduced the sentences he could deliver.

Violent ex-soldier Fuller and his friend Ellwood ambushed 
Ben Gillard and Andrew Richardson as they went to get a taxi after closing time at the Rampant Horse Pub in Fakenham in Norfolk in February 2012.

Mr Gillard and Mr Richardson were both knocked out cold with punches to the head, and were then kicked as they lay on the ground.

Mr Tidd, who worked with Mr Gillard at 4Skin Tattooing in Fakenham, chased the thugs away but Fuller turned and attacked him in an alley, smashing the 31-year-old's jaw in two places.

He needed extensive facial reconstruction surgery after the attack.

Fuller and Ellwood were originally charged with grievous bodily harm with intent, which can carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

But prosecutors later accepted Fuller's lesser plea of GBH without intent, which carries a maximum five year sentence. They also accepted Ellwood's plea of affray, which is capped at just three years.

Judge Coleman jailed father-of-two Fuller for three years and father-of-three Ellwood for 18 months.

After sentencing, he said: 'I go as far as to say that this misjudgement in the prosecutorial process I believe has led to a serious miscarriage of justice in that two men who should have been tried for causing GBH with intent were allowed to plead guilty to lesser charges which did not reflect their culpability.'

But Frank Ferguson, deputy chief crown prosecutor for the CPS East of England, last night denied there had been any 'misjudgement'.

He said he would be writing to Judge Coleman about his comments.

Mr Ferguson said the pleas had been considered carefully and discussed with the victims before they were accepted.

The crime that Fuller and Ellwood were originally charged with - wounding or causing grievous bodily harm with intent - carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.

The 'intent' element is the key factor in this case and relies on whether or not the perpetrators deliberately caused severe harm.

GBH with intent requires the perpetrator to have set out to cause their victim severe injuries, and therefore falls under Section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.

The maximum sentence for GBH with intent is life imprisonment, but there are three categories within the sentencing guidelines that allow for reduced term depending on the injuries caused or the perpetrator's culpability.

GBH without intent is considered a far less serious charge and falls under Section 20 of of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.

It is used when a person has caused their victim serious injuries, but the extent of those injuries was not intended.

Again the charge is split into various categories depending on harm and culpability, but even at its most serious level, the maximum sentence for the crime of five years.

Affray - the charge Ellwood pleaded guilty to - is a public order offence with a maximum sentence of just three years.

The attack took place after an argument over whose turn it was to use the pool table at the Rampant Horse Pub.

Fuller and Ellwood later attacked Mr Gillard and Mr Richardson outside the pub, before Mr Tidd attempted to come to their aid and had his jaw broken.

Lori Tucker, prosecuting, said Mr Tidd had had difficulty sleeping and his social life had deteriorated since he'd been savagely beaten up.

She said he had not been able to return to Fakenham since the incident.

The case was seriously delayed when prosecutors decided to pursue charges against a third man - Robbie Smith - after accepting evidence from Fuller and Ellwood.

Mr Smith was later cleared of all charges by a jury.

Speaking of Fuller and Ellwood’s evidence, Judge Coleman said: 'I positively disbelieve what both of you said on oath.'

He questioned why prosecutors had accepted the evidence against Mr Smith when the co-defendants had a clear 'self-serving interest' and had not made written statements to police.

Michael Clare, defending for Fuller, said he was a 'hard-working' scaffolder who had served in Iraq and Kosovo with the army.

Mr Clare said Fuller had a wife, an eight-year-old son and three-year-old daughter and the two-year wait before sentence had already punished them all.

'He has the mental wherewithal to deal with this, but he’s extremely concerned about how his wife will deal with this,' Mr Clare added.

Jonathan Goodman, defending for Ellwood, said he had a family and three children.

He’d separated from his wife but is expecting a child with a new partner.

Mr Goodman described the attack as an 'isolated incident'.

Sentencing, Judge Coleman told the two men: 'Mr Richardson and Mr Gillard were trying to get a taxi home with their friends and you both attacked them.'

'You were both engaged in the attack that involved punching and kicking and kicking when they were both rendered unconscious.'

He branded the incident 'serious violence', and said that although Ellwood was not sentenced for the attack on Mr Tidd, the affray was 'as bad a case as you can see'.

Judge Coleman said that if the pair end up qualifying for early release, they would both be banned from all pubs in Fakenham while on licence. 

He also gave the men a three-year exclusion order from the Rampant Horse pub.

Last night Mr Tidd said he was 'gutted' that Fuller and Ellwood had not been jailed for longer.

'For the trouble it’s caused me, the sleepless nights, the paranoia, I would prefer it if he [Fuller] went away for a little bit longer.'

'But I’m happy it’s over with and everyone can just go back to normality. The whole process has been quite draining.

'If you had asked me a year ago I think I would have been a bit angrier. I’m smiling today as I know it’s over now.'

Frank Ferguson, deputy chief crown prosecutor for the CPS East of England, said after the case: 'We are satisfied that the acceptance of the offer of pleas was correct and proper in the particular circumstances of this case and there has not been any misjudgement on the part of the prosecution.

'This was a case where we were offered pleas to affray by Aaron Ellwood and Ricky Fuller and also, in Fuller’s case, to actual bodily harm and grievous bodily harm.

'There were difficulties in relation to the evidence against these two defendants which we considered most carefully before deciding to accept the pleas.

'We discussed the pleas with the victims beforehand who indicated they were happy with the decision to accept them.”

He added: 'The pleas were also accepted by a different judge at an earlier hearing who shared the prosecution’s concerns about the evidence.'

'The case proceeded against a third defendant, Robbie Smith, who pleaded not guilty to affray and grievous bodily harm with intent and was acquitted after full jury trial.'

'At the sentencing hearing, as part of the outline of the case, counsel said that the pleas by both men included their involvement in punching and kicking the victims'

'Our view was that the basis of plea did show their involvement in the assaults against the victims and gave the court adequate sentencing powers'

'We will be writing to Judge Coleman regarding his comments.'
