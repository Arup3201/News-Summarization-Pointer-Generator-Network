Lamborghini today unveiled the world’s most expensive car - a super-aggressive model costing a staggering £3.36 million.

The jaw-dropping Lamborghini Veneno Roadster is a limited edition hypercar which goes without a roof.

It has been designed by the Italian firm to drive like a race car while being entirely road legal - making it one of the most extreme vehicles ever built.

Lamborghini has fitted the Veneno Roadster with a 750bhp V12 engine which gives the topless motor a 0-62mph time of just 2.9 seconds and a top speed of 220mph.

The radical machine, made of lightweight carbon fibre, follows the hardtop version which was limited to just three and came with a £3 million price-tag.

But the convertible, of which nine will be built, will set back potential owners a cool £3.36 million.
