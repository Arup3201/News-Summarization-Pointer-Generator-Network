Scotland produced a stunningly fresh performance that matched ambition with finishing skills at BT Murrayfield on Saturday evening with four tries running up a match-winning 31-10 lead inside 45 minutes.

The brothers Richie and Jonny Gray marked their first Test match together by opening the scoring for Scotland, responding to a breakaway try by Argentina flanker Javier Ortega Desio in the second minute with two scores within minutes of each other.

The locks were at the heart of a dominant display by the Scotland pack which left the usually steamrollering Pumas pack looking a pale shadow of themselves. Ross Ford was bang on with his lineout throws, newcomer Blair Cowan was a skillful and consistent presence at the breakdown to cause problems for Argentina in attack and Glasgow Warriors duo Adam Ashe and Rob Harley combined well in the loose to maintain Scotland’s front-foot tempo.

Another key figure in the Scotland performance was scrum-half Greig Laidlaw. The skipper looks a revitalised performer since his move to Gloucester in the summer and he created numerous chances with his speed of thought and movement across the new hybrid Murrayfield turf.

It was his break from a quick tap-penalty that set up the third try, the scrum-half delivering a fine pass off his left-hand to wing Sean Maitland for the winger to sprint in and when Laidlaw repeated the trick minutes after half-time it was Stuart Hogg who benefited and finished off in the right-hand corner.

Scotland were rampant at this stage, a team playing with great ambition and showing the skills so conspicuous in recent years only by their absence, and in truth they should have been further ahead by that stage but Laidlaw missed a couple of penalties and Hogg another, the younger Gray squandered a great chance with mark Bennett by taking the wrong option and another penalty infringement cost the Scots another score.

There was an inevitability about the way their pace dropped with Scotland having virtually wrapped it up and Argentina came back at them in the final half-hour. Their pack got on the ball, managed to take play through the phases they had been dearly lacking in the first hour and Scotland’s defence was made to work harder to keep them at bay.

This Scotland managed for the most part until being reducedin number. The Argentina attack was aided by yellow cards for Rob Harley and Jim Hamilton in the final quarter – the latter being sin-binned within minutes of coming off for a team penalty.

The Pumas, eager to restore some pride, took advantage to score a penalty try and finish off with two scores from replacement scrum-half Tomas Cubelli. Tommy Seymour had by then snatched an interception and broken away to score and that ensured Scotland’s victory was never threatened, and left Murrayfield a happy place for new coach Vern Cotter and the 36,000-plus supporters.

It was an entertaining game with plenty of tries to savour but the crucial statistic was that this was Scotland’s first win over Argentina, a team that has overtaken Scotland in the rankings in recent years, in five meetings at Murrayfield. A tide turning perhaps?

It is too early to say that, and it may be different when New Zealand pitch up next week after beating England, but for now Scotland have uncovered a new buoyancy fuelled by the potential of a new-look squad and that has been a long time coming for the home faithful in this fixture.
