Holidaymakers with money to splash can sail off on holiday in a smaller version of Grand Prix racing mogul Eddie Jordan's new superyacht - but it costs more than £7m. 

The Irishman made the news in January when he splashed out  on the biggest boat ever made by world-famous Sunseekers, based in Poole, Dorset.

Currently berthed in the glamorous South of France, the replica has got just one previous owner - a family who took delivery of it last year.

The yacht, currently berthed in the South of France, is available at under the list price for a new 115 Sport Yacht

The yacht comes with custom extras including a Jacuzzi on an open deck at the rear and a satellite TV system

Called Zozo, she will accommodate 10 guests in cabins which are 'beyond luxurious, with en suite bathrooms', say Sunseeker, which is renowned for making luxury boats for the rich and famous.

There's room for five crew and mod-cons include a Jacuzzi and satellite TV system.

Powered by MTU 2,640hp engines, she has a top speed of 26 knots.

A spokesman said 'Brand new to the market and available for immediate delivery - one of Sunseeker's most popular launches over 30 metres.

'This 115 Sport Yacht is the only example currently available on the market today. 

Dinner is served: There's enough room for a lavish banquet dinner on board the superyacht

The interior design was put together by Sunseeker's experienced in-house team

With just one previous owner the yacht is in immaculate condition and is available for immediate delivery

'Built and delivered for a very knowledgable owner and crew, 'Zozo' has only ever been used for private family cruising in the Western Med area.

'A very tasteful and discreet interior is twinned with a finely balanced layout compromising a master cabin on the main deck with four further guest cabins on the lower level.

'Fitted with all the extras one would expect to find on a 115 including saloon balcony, stabilisation system, hard top and many more custom extras including a jacuzzi on the flybridge, long range tanks, nav upgrades, HD11 sat TV system and much more.

'The interior design was put together by Sunseeker's experienced in-house team working closely with the owner and his family to ensure a comfortable but stylish look.

'Maintained by a permanent crew of five, Zozo is kept in turn key condition and viewing should be encouraged to fully appreciate this fine yacht.

'Available at substantially under the list price for a new 115 Sport Yacht this boat also beats the extensive waiting which currently stretches well into 2015.

The long-range tanks hold 14,100 litre of fuel and there's even a dishwasher on board, wi-fi, water softener system, CCTV and even polished stainless steel anchors and tropical air conditioning.
