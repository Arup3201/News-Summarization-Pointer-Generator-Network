A 27-year-old Frenchman claims he was kicked out of an American Airlines flight because he smelled bad — and was admonished to 'take a shower' by the crew.

The passenger, identified only as an Algerian-born man named 'Mehdi,' says he was about to board the Dallas-bound plane at Paris' Charles-de-Gaulle Airport when he was approached by flight attendants.

'The crew and passengers complained of 
your smell,' one flight attendant told the man, according to cell phone footage watched by Agence France-Presse.

'You're with an American company, this is American territory and the captain has the right to refuse you,' the crew member added, according to AFP. 'You will not be flying today.'

The crew member told the man to 'take a shower,' according to the report.

Police were called and they escorted the man off the plane.

He filed a discrimination complaint against American Airlines.

'I covered myself with Dior perfume at the duty free shop,' he told AFP by away of explanation.

American Airlines did not immediately respond to a call from MailOnline seeking comment on Tuesday.

But a spokesman told AFP that the man had 'visa issues,' though he would not comment further to protect the passenger's privacy.

The man told the agency that he had an 'American flag in his room and dreamed of visiting' the US — but his experience has 'totally changed his view of America.'
