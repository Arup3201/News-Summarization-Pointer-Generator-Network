She may be rapidly approaching her 66th 
birthday, but when the Duchess of Cornwall stepped out at the investiture of the new King of the Netherlands earlier this week, the world was in awe of her glamorous new look.

The secret behind Camilla's fresh-faced glow is bee venom, which she slathers across her skin to maintain a youthful visage.

And it seems that women are rushing to emulate her look because sales of bee venom have soared since photographs of her youthful looks were released.

Beauty buzz: After Camilla stepped out looking glamorous and youthful in Amsterdam, sales of bee venom soared

One beauty brand - Skin Chemists - saw pre-orders for their new £135 Bee Venom Facial Serum hit 3,100 immediately after Camilla's beauty secret was revealed.

The brand, which is a firm favourite of model Jourdan Dunn, Tulisa, Amy Childs and Liam Payne's girlfriend Danielle Peazer, has also reported a huge surge in people searching for the term 'bee venom' across the web.

The Bee Venom Serum contains key ingredients and plumping agents to smooth out the texture and appearance of fine lines.

Plant extracts such as watercress, stinging nettles and horsetail help the skin revitalise and allow for sebum regulating.

Skin Chemists are famed for their powerful anti-aging treatments and their hero product, the Wrinkle Killer Snake Serum, is a firm favourite of Tulisa's.

The songstress tweeted her love for the £135 potion that includes 
syn-ake - a neuro-peptide that mimics the effect of the Asian temple 
viper's venom.

Tulisa, who also uses the brand's fat-busting 'Sculpt and Tone' body cream, £135, took to Twitter to sing the 
praises of the serum, which she described as 'amazing'.

And now, Skin Chemists are hoping for the same effect with their newly launched Bee Venom.

Camilla's personal favourite is the organic ‘Heaven’ bee
 venom facial she was given by skin care guru Deborah Mitchell.

Camilla
 has long been a fan of beauty therapist Deborah Mitchell, who treats 
her regularly with her £165 bee sting facial, hailed as a ‘non-surgical 
facelift’ – the organic alternative to Botox.

As a former cigarette smoker and sun worshiper, the Duchess of Cornwall may not be the first person who 
springs to mind for beauty tips.

But in fact, Camilla has been advising the Duchess of Cambridge on her complexion and has recommended using bee venom herself.
