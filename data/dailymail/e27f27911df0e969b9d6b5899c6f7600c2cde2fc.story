Katie Hopkins installs fear in the hearts of millions – the acid-tongued star even turned the original ice queen Katie Price into a meek woman on the current series of Celebrity Big Brother, despite the glamour model insisting there would be fireworks between them.

But there is ONE person in this world who can control the notoriously outspoken star – her husband Marl Cross – a design manager so quiet and kind that he is known to friends and family as ‘Lovely Mark’.

In an interview with FEMAIL, Katie reveals that while she refuses to listen to anyone, even her own children, she bows down to her 50-year-old husband in every argument.

Katie Hopkins met Mark Cross (pictured) while he was still with his first wife Ruth. The couple married in 2010 and have one child together. She says he is the nicest man in the world and her total opposite.

She said: ‘He is probably the only person on the planet that can control me, weirdly, because whatever he says is going to be right and there is no escaping that.

‘If he was an a***hole you could just ignore it but he's not.’

The couple met in 2006 while working at the Met Office together and first got together in 2007, shortly after Katie had appeared on BBC1 show The Apprentice.

At the time, Katie was newly-divorced from her first husband Damian McKinney and Mark was still in a seven-year marriage with his first wife Ruth.

The romance came to light after the couple were caught having sex in a field and the pictures were splashed across the pages of a national tabloid the next day.

Katie first became a household name after appearing on the Apprentice in 2007. She had a fling with one of the other contestants Paul Callaghan but he dumped her after finding out about her affair with Mark

Unsurprisingly, Mark’s first marriage failed to survive the indiscretion and he split from Ruth soon after.

He and Katie then started dating and he soon moved into the Exeter home she shared with her two children from her first marriage, India and Poppy. 

Then in 2008, their son Max, now six, was born. 

Two years later, the pair married in a barn on an episode of Celebrity Four Weddings, alongside Lizzie Cundy, comic Francine Lewis and ex-popstar David Van Day. 

In a recent documentary that saw Katie gain and lose several stone in six months, her husband Mark was often seen comforting his wife at her lowest ebb, as she tearfully talked to him in a baby voice.

It was a startling change to the TV personality, who mainly appears on camera delivering nasty put-downs to her opponents with a steely glare.

And Katie admits that even her in-laws can’t believe that her husband has chosen to settle down with her.

In an interview with MailOnline just before she went onto the Channel 4 reality show earlier this month, she said: ‘Mark is genuinely the polar opposite of me and everyone says that.

‘He's known as “Lovely Mark,” which really gets on my t***, everyone says to me with a look of horror, "What, you're married to lovely Mark?"

‘His relatives in Australia actually said to me at Christmas, “It's a surprise that you're married to our Mark.”

‘He is genuinely the nicest man on the planet. Not in a wet way though.’

Mark and Katie have one child together, Max, and the couple live with her two children from her previous marriage in a large town house in Exeter.

Katie claims that she is happier that she has ever been in her life and puts the emotions down to her marriage.

She says Mark has shown her a new way to live – one that involves less aggro – and while she might not take it fully on-board, some of it has seeped into her behaviour.

The personality that made her famous often sees her battle against everyone from celebrities on This Morning to mums at the school gate, but Katie admits that Mark is her opposite in every way.

She said: ‘He'll do all of the things that grown-ups tell you to do.

Like for instance, if someone p***** you off on an email - I would just fire one right back or even highlight their own failings.

‘Mark would do the sensible thing, which is wait two days and then reply in a thought-out and thoroughly sensible manner.

‘He'll take the time to listen to what the kids are saying and respond in a grown up manner.

‘He encourages them to have their own points of view and feelings about things and their own responses.

‘I don't have time for any of that. I just shout what I think and that's that.

‘But that is Mark. I can’t even imagine what he has to say about me, but whatever it is, he would be truthful.’

Katie is famous for her bust-ups with celebrities on the This Morning sofa, including an explosive row with the late Peaches Geldof 

It is the fact that he is so different from her that Katie believes the marriage has worked.

She said: ‘I married myself with my first husband, he would agree entirely I'm sure. But that didn't work at all.

‘And so with Mark I have married my polar opposite - he wears soft shoes, he has an earring, he has a skull as a wedding ring and he's a designer.

‘I mean, you couldn't be more opposite. And that seems to have worked.

‘I don't know how or why, but I think it is because he can tell me when I have gone over the line.

‘And obviously he does that on a daily basis.’

Much like Mark, Katie’s first husband Damian was married when they first met in 2003.

Damian, a Major in the Royal Marines, had been pensioned off because of arthritis and had built a hugely successful management consultancy called McKinney Rogers in Bicton, Devon.

Katie joined the firm as a junior client co-ordinator in 2000 and quickly rose through the ranks, being promoted to head of the US office within 18 months.

She and Damian then started up a relationship and things quickly became serious, leading to him leaving his wife Tina. 

Katie has recently claimed that Damian had split from his wife when they started dating, but his wife Tina is adamant that is not the case.

Damian’s divorce from Tina was finalised in May 2003 and that autumn Katie announced she was pregnant.

The couple married in September 2004, four months after the birth of their daughter India, now nine years old.

The couple went on to have a second child together called Poppy, now seven, in 2006, but Katie has since claimed that by then Damian was having an affair with another work colleague and left her soon after the birth.

The couple have an amicable relationship for the sake of their children, but Katie recently acknowledged that the incident made her appreciate her relationship with her now-husband so much more and revealed that although she bounced back from her last marriage, Mark having an affair would break her.

She also told Now magazine that she would no longer ever consider having an affair, despite admitting to having them in the past.

She said ‘I would never cheat on my husband now.

‘There’s too much at stake. When you have a family, you can’t think like a single person any more.

‘There are too many little hearts to look after. I couldn’t look at my kids if I’d let them down like this - it would be too big a price to pay.’
