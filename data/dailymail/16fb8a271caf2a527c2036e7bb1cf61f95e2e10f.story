A photographer has lifted the lid on a famously unexplained light phenomenon that appears in an area of the Missouri known as the Devil's Promenade

Locals in the Ozarks hills say they have seen the light and heard the tales of it all their lives.

The name of the area is the title of the series, created by artists Lara Shipley and Antone Dolezal,- but the mysterious apparition itself is known to the townspeople in southwest Missouri as the Spook Light.

Spook Light appears as a basketball-sized orb of light, but only every so often and only by chance on a road called E50, where the rolling Ozark hills disappear into the endless flatness of Kansas and Oklahoma.

The light: Artists Antone Dolezol and Lara Shipley traveled to an area of the Ozarks known as Devil's Promenade, a moniker that lent their project its name, in order to try and catch the intermittent, unexplained  phenomenon for which locals have varying explanations

On E50, also known as Spook Road, there's a gathering south of the town of Joplin each year at 
Halloween, when hopeful visitors and locals alike seek a chance 
encounter with the Spook Light.

Meanwhile, the cause of the light--which hovers in the sky and is seen to change colors as it moves towards and away from the viewer--remains a mystery.

Even the Army Corps of Engineers once tried to pinpoint the cause of the floating orb. They traveled to the area outside Joplin, a town now known as the 2011 site of a devastating F5 tornado, to study the Spook Light in the early 1940s.

They were unable to come to any conclusions.

Guesses as to its origins run from everyday expulsions of gas from the areas abundant shale deposits to UFOs.

Denizens: The area where the Spook Light is colorful even without the lore. Some locals believe its the ghost of a Civil War soldier, while others say it is an Indian spook

Isolated: The isolated locals manage a living in rural Newton County, where everyone seems have a version of the Spook Light story

Parallels: The series points toward parallels between the Bible Belt area's haunting anomaly and its denizens' struggles to remain in the light, here on Earth and beyond

MANY NAMES

The Spook Light can be found south of Joplin, Missouri, a town now better known as the site of a devastating F5 tornado in 2011.

The anomaly is variously called the Spook Light, Ghost Light, Joplin Ghost Light, Ozark Spook Light, Devil's Jack-O'-Lantern, Hornet Ghost Light, and others.

MANY LEGENDS

Like folklore anywhere, the legend of the Spook Light and its origins varies each time its told. Some maintain the light is the torch of a beheaded Quapaw or Osage Indian in search of his lost head.

According to another origin tale, the orbs are the spectral remains of the mutual murder of a native man and a white farmer in the woods.

Others legends say the light is the ghost of a Confederate soldier or that of a decapitated miner.

NO EXPLANATIONS

Despite an attempt in the 1940s by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to study the Spook Light, it's true origins remain a mystery.

Some say the lights are the result of gases emerging from the abundant shales in the area.

Others blame reflected car headlights, though official reports date back to an 1881 publication called Ozark Spook Light, well before motor vehicles began passing through the area.

Luminescence from rotting organic matter has also been fingered, as have UFOs.

ONE FORM

While the name and explanations vary, all those who see the Spook Light report it as an orb or several orbs that float on the horizon and can appear to move quite quickly. It is described as being able to change colors from blue to red to gold.

'Its very spooky,' said local Mary Roundtree. 'It looks like a light way far off, and then its right on you.'

Roundtree said she saw the light as a kid when she and her parents were lured to E50 out of curiosity.

'My heart was just pounding and it was up in my throat and I thought my head was going to explode and my hands got all cold,' she said.

Local
 legend has it that the first to see the lights were the local Quapaw 
Indians, and some stories saw the light is actually the tormented 
spirits of two Quapaw lovers run off a cliff by an angry Chieftan.

Other
 folklore says the light is the torch of a Quapaw or Osage Indian who 
was beheaded and is searching for his head. Still others maintain it's 
the spirit of a decapitated miner or Confederate soldier in search of 
his lost head.

And for every
 story behind the lights, there's another name for them. It has been 
referred to as the Hornet Ghost Light, Devil's Jack-O'-Lantern, Ozark 
Spook Light, and Joplin Ghost Light.

Regardless of the tale behind it or its proper name, the locals who've seen the phenomenon are adamant it is real.

Roberta Williams from Carthage, Missouri has seen the light
and told her story to Mysterious Universe.

‘It was before midnight,’ she said. ‘It was like a big, huge
ball with a yellow glow and it went right straight through our car. I just
screamed.’

Mary Roundtree, a local historian, told NPR she's seen the light, too.

'Its very spooky,' she said. 'It looks like a light way far off, and then its right on you.'

Roundtree said she saw the light as a kid when she and her parents were lured to E50 out of curiosity.

'My
 heart was just pounding and it was up in my throat and I thought my 
head was going to explode and my hands got all cold,' she said.

And like almost everyone else whose seen the bobbing orb, she has her own variation of the tale that's behind it.

According
 to Roundtree, a old Indian man came across some dead bodies in the 
woods where the Spook now appears. After he buried them, a white farmer 
came by carrying a lantern. The two killed one another but the light of 
the lantern still hangs there as an apparition.

The Devil’s Promenade is as dedicated to the the inhabitants of the rural, 
impoverished area as it is to the Spook Light. The series paints a vivid picture of both the 
haunting landscape and the fascinating people who populate it.

'We
 feel the frequent and mysterious appearance of the Spook Light has come
 to represent for the people we meet a desire for redemption and the 
fear of slipping into darkness,' write Shipley and Dolezal. 'Our aim is 
not to provide documentation, but to suggest a narrative that, in the 
spirit of the light, is part fixed in this unique region and part afloat
 in a mysterious, otherworldly realm.'
