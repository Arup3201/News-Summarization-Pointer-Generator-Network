There are various, well-known tweaks you can make to your smartphone to boost its battery life, such as turning off Wi-Fi and decreasing the screen’s brightness.

But these only have a limited effect when other features and services are draining energy, often without you even realising they're doing so.

Glasgow-based experts have now created an interactive guide that reveals how to save battery life using tips specific to individual phones, such as Apple’s iPhones, HTC and Samsung’s range of devices, and Sony’s handsets.

It also includes older models, and handsets from Motorola, LG, BlackBerry, Amazon, Huawei and Nokia – now known as Lumia.

The tips, compiled by electronics retailer liGO, begins by asking the user to select their make and model.

An image of the handset appears below, surrounded by tips that conserve battery life on that particular model.

Testing has revealed that the battery in Sony's Xperia Z3 handset not only lasts, on average, for 48 hours, this is the case even when streaming music, making calls and watching videos.

Tests involved using the device for approximately five hours over a 24-hour period, for a range of ‘typical usage scenarios’.

They included calling, texting, surfing the web, checking social networks, playing games, using the camera, listening to music and streaming video.   

Clicking on a tip reveals the steps needed to disable, or enable, the selected features, alongside information about why it drains battery, where appropriate.

The guide does assume that smartphone owners are running the most up-to-date version of operating system available.

Running older systems can cause battery problems themselves.

According to the guide, Apple iPhone 5S users, for example, can save battery life by managing which apps update in the background - known as Background App Refresh.

This feature is accessed via Settings, General, and by switching off the apps that are automatically updated. 

The reason this drains battery is because, even when the phone isn’t being used, these apps use a network to pull in data. This tip applies to Samsung's Galaxy S5, too.

This feature also uses data that owners may not be aware of. 

However, be aware that by disabling Background App Refresh can prevent notifications appearing until the app is manually opened.

Another tip, for Samsung Galaxy S5 owners, is to turn off Air Wake Up.

According to the guide, Samsung Galaxy S5 users, for example, can save battery life by managing which apps refresh in the background - known as Background App Refresh. The reason this drains battery is because, even when the phone is not being used, these apps use a network to pull in data

Apple iPhone 5S (pictured) users can save battery by disabling Handoff. Handoff allows users to pass over work to other iCloud devices. It is disabled through Settings, General and Handoff & Suggested Apps. The guide does assume that smartphone owners are running the most up-to-date version of operating system available

Smart stay features detect when people are looking at their screen, and means the display remains on, effectively disabling auto-locking.

This feature uses the forward-facing camera, so disabling it via Settings reduces power usage.

And for Windows Phone users, seen on the Lumia range of devices and HTC One (M8) for Windows, limiting what tiles are pinned to the start will reduce power usage.

These tiles automatically refresh to show up-to-date Facebook posts, tweets, emails or weather details, for example, and this uses battery.
