The AirAsia plane that crashed into the Java Sea last month  climbed faster than 'normal speed' and stalled, Indonesia's Transport Minister has revealed.

All 162 people on board flight QZ8501 are thought to have died when it crashed during a short trip from Surabaya to Singapore.

At an earlier parliamentary hearing, Ignasius Jonan said radar data showed the Airbus A320-200 was climbing at a rate of 6,000ft (1,800m) a minute before the crash.

He added: 'I think it is rare even for a fighter jet to be able to climb 6,000ft per minute.

'For a commercial flight, climbing around 1,000 to 2,000 (feet) is maybe already considered extraordinary, because it is not meant to climb that fast.'

Stalled: Indonesia's Transport Minster said flight QZ8501 was climbing abnormally fast before it stalled

Unusual: Citing radar data, Ignasius Jonane revealed it was climbing at 6,000ft per minute - which is 'rare even for a fighter jet', he said

Conclusive: As a police officer guards part of the fuselage of the jet, investigators are analysing  the flight data recorder, which monitors every major part of the plane to determine what caused the crash

Lost: All but seven of those on board the routine flight from Surabaya to Singapore were Indonesian

Tragedy: The AirAsia jet crashed into the Java Sea last month with 162 people on board, who are all thought to have died

Investigation: Judging from the plane's voice recorder, investigators ruled out the possibility that terrorists were to blame for the crash 

The country's meteorological agency thought bad weather may have caused the tragedy, and investigators are still studying the plane's black box before releasing an official report.

But it's emerged the pilot asked for permission to climb to a higher altitude to avoid the storm, moments before the plane disappeared from radar. His request was not granted due to 'heavy air traffic'.

The Transport Minister added: 'In the final minutes, the plane climbed at a speed which was beyond normal.

'The plane suddenly went up at a speed above the normal limit that it was able to climb to. Then it stalled.'

This latest revelation comes as Indonesian investigators focused on the possibility of human error, or mechanical problems with the plane having caused the crash - following an initial analysis of the cockpit voice recorder.

Terrorism had already been ruled out according to investigator Nurcahyo Utomo, who said: 'We didn't hear any other person, no explosion.' 

As well as the cockpit voice recorder, the committee is also examining a wealth of information in the flight data recorder, which monitors every major part of the plane. A preliminary report will be releasd on January 28.

Mourning: Rescuers have only been able to recover 53 bodies from the plane, after a massive international search helped to discover the crash sites

Confusion: Moments before the plane disappeared from radar, the pilot's request to climb to a higher altitude to avoid a storm was denied

Discovery: Last week, a Singapore navy ship located the jet's main body, with the AirAsia motto 'Now Everyone Can Fly' painted on the side

Unsuccessful recovery: Divers have failed to reach the fuselage, despite several attempts due to bad weather

Ships from several different countries, including the US and China, were involved in a huge international hunt for the crashed plane. 

Indonesian search and rescue teams have so far recovered just 53 bodies from the sea.

But last week, a Singapore navy ship located the jet's main body - with the AirAsia motto 'Now Everyone Can Fly' painted on the side. 

Rescue teams hope they will be able to find many of the passengers and crew inside.

Divers have so far failed to reach the fuselage despite several attempts due to bad weather, high waves and strong underwater currents.

All but seven of those on board the flight were Indonesian. The foreign nationals were from South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Britain and France.
