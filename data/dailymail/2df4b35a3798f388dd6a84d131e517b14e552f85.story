Former Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez believes his old club will be losing their 'red heartbeat' when Steven Gerrard leaves at the end of the season. 

The Napoli coach added his own tribute to Gerrard, saying the 'Miracle of Istanbul' - the 2005 Champions League final victory against AC Milan from 3-0 down - would not have been possible without the inspirational captain.

Benitez posted a poignant message to Gerrard on his personal website after the announcement that the 34-year-old would be leaving his hometown club Liverpool at the end of the season.

'If I could think of one word to describe Steven Gerrard it would be passion,' said Benitez. 'He was my captain at Liverpool Football Club for six seasons and we worked closely together to develop a side that could win the Premier League and the Champions League. 'Without Steven we could not have achieved the incredible success that we enjoyed throughout those years.

'The "Miracle of Istanbul" was only possible because of him. Steven inspired the team that night, refusing to believe it was an impossible job at half time against AC Milan. He led the charge with a wonderful headed goal and showed the determination needed to win a penalty for our third goal. 

'And when called upon to sacrifice his position on the pitch for the team he didn’t hesitate. It was the perfect stage for him to showcase his talents, and Steven and the other Liverpool players were rewarded with the European Cup. 

Benitez left a poignant message to Gerrard on his personal website in the aftermath of the news 

Gerrard was photographed leaving Melwood in his car on Friday afternoon following the announcement 

'He nearly always thrived on the big occasion, producing one of the great FA Cup goals as we beat West Ham at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. And the partnership he developed with Fernando Torres produced some of the most exciting attacking football the Premier League has ever seen.' 

Benitez was manager of Liverpool between 2004 and 2010, reaching two Champions League finals, winning the FA Cup and finishing runners-up in the Premier League.

'After hearing the news today that Steven will leave Liverpool at the end of the season I wanted to wish him all the best for the future and thank him for his all his hard work during the time I was at Anfield,' he said.

'Liverpool FC is not just losing a great athlete, or a great footballer. The club is losing its red heartbeat. Steve, remember, you’ll never walk alone.' 

Benitez became an instant legend by winning the Champions League on penalties in an amazing comeback against Milan but clearly believes he partly has Gerrard to thank for that.
