The perfect camping holiday used to depend on the weather, but since the opening of the world’s first indoor caravan park, not even the rain can get you down.

The unique hotel experience can be found in Berlin, Germany where classic caravans and wooden huts have been given a makeover to suit even the choosiest hipster-glamper.

The Huttenpalast, or 'Hut Palace' features all the classic caravanning accessories, from 'outdoor' communal areas to lights in the ‘trees’ to help you find your way around the campsite at night.

Huttenpalast is the brainchild of Silke Lorenzen, and events manager, and interior designer Sarah Vollmer who wanted to create a hotel which kept the traditional campsite feeling.

It is located in an old vacuum cleaner factory where the pair have incorporated the static wooden cabins and mobile touring caravans in place of traditional hotel rooms.

Silke said: ‘We wanted to preserve the integrity of the building but also create a communal atmosphere for guests where people can actually meet each other.

‘We thought about a 'room-in-room concept' and decided to build little wooden cabins in the hall.'

Outside but inside: Although it may lack the fresh air of the outdoors, there is no risk of rain, hail or snow

Mobile home:The interior has been stripped out of the caravan and it has been converted into a cozy double-bed

‘But we wanted more flexibility inside the place so it could be used for events of all kind as well so decided to put wheels under the cabins.

‘It was then we realised there are already cabins with wheels - caravans.

'Before we knew it we had three caravans in Huttenpalast.’

The pair have stripped the caravans of all the original utilities and redecorated each one with its own unique theme.

One of them has been completely transformed into a cocoon-like hideaway with a wooden mosaic interior while another has been beautifully lit and fitted with a full size double bed.

The third caravan has been provided with its own scenery, surrounded by birch trees and its residents are spoiled with a view - of the street outside.

The 'ultimate urban camping' only costs €60 a night (around £50) and when you feel like breakfast, a little bag of fruit and croissants are hung on one of the branches outside your window.
