Sweden has a constitutional monarchy 
in which the royals primarily serve as figureheads. The king is the 
country's head of state, but his powers are limited to ceremonial 
duties.

'The Office of 
the Marshal of the Realm is delighted to announce that H.R.H. Princess 
Madeleine gave birth to a daughter on February 20, 2014 at 10.41 pm 
local time New York,' the Swedish court said.

'Both mother and child are in good health.'

The
 baby was born at New York Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center, 
and O'Neill was at the hospital during the entire delivery.

'Everything went well. The mother and child are doing well,' Royal Court spokeswoman Annika Sönnerberg told the TT news agency.

The king and queen, who are in Stockholm, have been told of the birth of their second grandchild.

'Victoria
 has also been informed. But exactly what the royal family plans to do, 
whether they will travel to the US or not, remains unclear,' said 
Sönnerberg.

Prime Minister 
Fredrik Reinfeldt also issued a statement through his press secretary 
welcoming the newest member of the royal family.

'My
 warmest congratulations to Princess Madeleine and Chris O'Neill, who 
today became parents of a little girl. It's a big day for the Royal 
Court and for the new parents,' Reinfeldt said.

O'Neill,
 who was born in London, maintained his US citizenship following his 
marriage to Princess Madeleine. If their child only takes US 
citizenship, she cannot be included in the line of succession.

Their
 child would also be barred from ascending to the Swedish throne if she 
doesn't grow up in Sweden or if she is raised Catholic, the religion of 
her father.

Public support 
for the ceremonial monarchy has weakened slightly in recent years, but 
remains fairly broad in otherwise egalitarian Sweden.

A Swedish royal expert called Princess Madeline's New York birth 'practical' but also said that many is Sweden would be 'disappointed'

Sweden's one-time 'party princess' 
lives with her British-American husband, 39, in New York where she works
 for the World Childhood Foundation, a non-profit group founded by her 
mother, Queen Silvia.

The couple met after Princess Madeleine fled to the U.S. in 2010 with a broken heart.

She
 crossed the Atlantic following the breakdown of her first engagement to
 Swedish attorney Jonas Bergstrom amid speculation that he had cheated 
on her.

Rumours of a 
romance with Mr O'Neill first emerged in early 2011 when the pair were 
seen together at the Central Park Boathouse.

A source told the New York Post at the time: 'She is always happy when she is with him.'

Madeleine says she and her husband were friends first, and a relationship blossomed over time.
