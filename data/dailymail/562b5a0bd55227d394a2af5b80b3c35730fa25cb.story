An inseparable father and son who were staying in adjoining rooms at a hospice in their final weeks battling cancer died of the disease within a day of each other.

Eileen Thurlow, 71, has been left devastated by the death of both her husband Eric and her son Dean after both succumbed to cancer.

The pair spent a lot of time together as they loved fishing and travelled around the country together to pursue the sport.

Mrs Thurlow, who had been married to Mr Thurlow senior for 45 years, said: 'The last few months have just been a nightmare.

'We all just feel numb. It's like being trapped in a bad dream.' 

Dean, who has an eight-year-old son, became ill four years ago. His father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer about 15 months ago and underwent surgery and chemotherapy but died this week.

Dean was taken into Pendleside Hospice on September 25, with his father following him just weeks later on October 8.

Mrs Thurlow, of Briercliffe, Lancashire, added: 'Eric and Dean were very close, they shared a lot of interests, particularly fishing. 

'They went all over the country fishing.

'Both were quiet, caring men who loved the outdoors.

'They shared adjoining rooms at the hospice who were fantastic with us. We knew once one went the other would go.' 

Mr Thurlow senior, a grandfather, died on Wednesday - a day after his son.

The 71-year-old grew up on the Isle of Wight and moved to Burnley, Lancashire, when he joined the Queens Lancashire Regiment in which he served as a bandsman playing the drum.

The couple also have a daughter called Tracy who lives in Bristol with her 22-year-old son. 

Dean's partner Gill Isherwood said: 'Dean was a very quiet man who lived for Jake and the great outdoors.

Eric Thurlow, 70, was said to be very close to his grandchildren, Jack (middle) and Jake, son of Dean (front)

The Thurlow family have been left devastated by the death of the father and son, both within days of each other

'He was a self-employed joiner and previously worked with his dad in the trade.

'Dean also loved to go out in his campervan and walk our dogs Simba and Elsa. You don't think you can cry anymore then more tears come.' 

The pair will have a joint funeral this week, with rods placed on the top of their coffins.
