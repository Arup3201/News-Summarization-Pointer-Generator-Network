Among the numerous rumours about the size and shape of Apple’s upcoming iPhone 6, reports of individual features have been lacking.

Exclusive photos acquired by uSwitch Tech appear to show one of these features, in the form of an Apple logo-shaped aperture. 

This has fuelled speculation that the logo on the rear of future handsets will light up when new messages or updates arrive.

This would allow users to put their phone face down on a table, for example, but still be notified when someone contacts them.

If these latest Apple rumours are true, the technology would be similar to that seen on the Lunecase.

The
 Lunecase uses excess energy, generated when the phone connects to a 
network, to show notifications - and can distinguish between the 
individual wavelengths created by calls and texts.

These
 notifications appear on the rear of the case, before the phone 
registers they've arrived, and means alerts can be seen when the phone 
is face down.

Alternatively,
 the Lunecase Eclipse version uses flashing lights around the Apple icon
 to notify of incoming messages and calls.

Cases are expected to retail for $50 (£30) and go on sale in August.

‘Today our snaps, which we worked with leaks-world lynchpin Sonny Dickson to source, could offer conclusive proof that this is indeed the case,’ explained uSwitch Tech.

Rear housings for previous iPhones have been aperture-free solid blocks that feature the Apple logo embossed on the exterior of the handset.

In the latest images of what the firm call a ‘market-ready version’ of the case, the logo is part of the plastic panel inside the interior of the rear housing.

‘Tellingly, the plastic part looks to have been made thin enough that light can easily shine through,’ continued uSwitch Tech.

The rear panel in the images is also more polished than previous leaks, but confirm the rounded edges and redesigned camera flash seen in past prototypes.

Both the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch versions of the iPhone 6 are expected to be unveiled in September.

However, it’s thought that manufacturing challenges could mean that the larger, phablet model might not go on sale until next year.

uSwitch Tech acquired the images with help from prolific Apple-tipster, Sonny Dickson. Dickson recently got 
his hands on leaked images of the front and back of a possible Apple LCD
 backlight panel (pictured) that measures 5.5 inches (14cm). The photos suggest 
Apple is already producing components for its anticipated device

Meanwhile, London-based Cliq has developed an Android case that adds control buttons to the rear of the device.

Three touch-based options can be programmed to launch the camera, take photos, make a call, send a pre-written text and control music.

It is available from Kickstarter for $25 (£15) and will be shipped from August.
