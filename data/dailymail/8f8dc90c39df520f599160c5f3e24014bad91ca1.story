This is the terrifying moment a jeweller was tasered in his home by a raider posing as a delivery man – before his brave fiancee grabbed a kitchen knife and chased off the intruder.

The attack on multi-millionaire gold dealer Nigel Blackburn was caught on CCTV at his home in Hemington, Leicestershire.

As the 56-year-old went to sign for what he thought was a package, he was shot in the side of his neck with the Taser and pushed to the floor.

Attack: Paul Grimshaw is caught on CCTV trying to raid Nigel Blackburn's home in Hemington, Leicestershire. The 31-year-old can be seen tasering the multi-millionaire's neck with a stun-gun as he lies on the ground

Shock: Grimshaw, who is disguised as a deliveryman, looks up as Mr Blackburn's fiancée runs downstairs

Brave: Pranne Rice, 29, charges at her husband-to-be's attacker with a kitchen knife - causing him to flee

Recovering: Mr Blackburn, pictured with Miss Rice, suffered a cut arm and facial and neck injuries in the attack

The dramatic footage then shows the 
would-be burglar fleeing in  terror as Mr Blackburn’s fiancee, Pranee 
Rice, and her friend, Mornrat Sangyang, charge at him with kitchen 
knives.

Speaking outside Leicester Crown Court, Mr Blackburn said: ‘Pranee stopped me from being killed.

When
the delivery man suddenly stuck a stun-gun into my neck the pain was 
excruciating. I dragged him to the floor with me and started shouting.

‘Pranee
and Mornrat heard me and came downstairs as fast as two horses bolting.
They just grabbed some knives and charged straight at him, screaming to
get out. He must have been terrified of them.’

Judge Simon Hammond, who jailed attacker Paul Grimshaw for eight years, commended the two women for their ‘great bravery’.

The judge said: ‘When the fiancee and her friend appeared tooled up with knives, the defendant thought he’d had enough.

Unsuspecting: CCTV footage captures the shocking moment the attempted raid unfolded on June 20 this year

Disguise: Mr Blackburn signs for a parcel, completely unaware of the fake deliveryman's real intentions

Hidden agenda: Grimshaw suddenly grabs hold of Mr Blackburn, who runs a jewellery business in Birmingham

‘I’m publicly commending the two women in the house, who I think behaved with great bravery in chasing him away.’

Grimshaw,
31, from Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, who fled empty-handed, admitted 
aggravated burglary and possessing a stun gun with intent to commit 
robbery.

Miss Rice, 29,
had initially answered the door to him on the evening of June 20, but 
he insisted that her fiance sign for the parcel.

She
told the court: ‘We were upstairs, heard the noise and just acted 
instinctively, without thinking. We’re proud the judge praised our 
actions. It was very frightening but we’d do it again.’

Grimshaw
told police he was reluctantly recruited by a criminal gang to enter 
the property and overpower Mr Blackburn before others followed to loot 
the house. No one else was caught, however.

Mr
Blackburn, who suffered minor injuries, has now moved home and has sold
his car, which had a personalised number plate. He said: ‘Sadly, my 
partner won’t sleep without a weapon next to the bed now.’

Alert: On hearing the attack, Miss Rice and friend Mornrat Sangyang run out of the house armed with knives
