An executive fighting a £300,000 battle to make insurers pay up for a fire that gutted his home has denied that his boyfriend started the blaze while having a 'hissy fit.'

Jonathan Smyth returned home from work on the evening of Tuesday, January 22 2008, to find his house in Margaret Street, Brighton, ablaze with police and firefighters in attendance.

The fire, which started in a basement bedroom, made the £350,000 house uninhabitable and caused huge damage to the contents - as well as killing three pet cats.

Mr Smyth, who shared his four-storey three-bedroom house with two friends and his 41-year-old boyfriend Tony Howe - pet name ‘Tony Bear’ - subsequently made a claim for £200,000 against his policy with St Andrews Insurance Plc.

However the company refused to pay, denying liability for the damage, and asserting that Mr Howe had 'set the fire' when he was ‘intoxicated’ and having what his boyfriend described in court as 'a Tony Bear tantrum.'

Mr Smyth, who works as an information security manager for Direct Line, is suing the insurers for more than £300,000 in the High Court, asking Judge John Randall QC to force them to meet his claim, plus interest and expenses.

The court heard that while Mr Smyth, now of Cooperage Quay, Stirling, Scotland, was at work on the evening of the fire, Mr Howe and their flatmate, Rebecca Alexander, had an 'altercation' prior to the blaze being discovered.

The court heard Mr Howe and the couple's flatmate Rebecca Alexander (pictured) had an 'altercation' before the blaze was discovered

The two flatmates had a 'history' of disagreements 'about tidiness' in the house, Sonia Nolten, for the insurance company, told the court.

Mr Smyth had received a text from Miss Alexander as he made his way home from work, saying that Mr Howe had gone into a 'big fat Tony Tantrum' and that the pair had fallen out.

The fire was discovered and the house evacuated whilst Miss Alexander, at the foot of whose bed the seat of the blaze was found, was out and she subsequently made 'accusations of arson' against Mr Howe.

The fire brigade investigated and concluded that 'the most likely cause was a deliberate act.' Both Mr Howe and Miss Alexander were subsequently interviewed by the police in relation the fire, but neither was charged.

However, on the basis of reports by the police and fire service, the insurance company, after its own inquiries, refused to pay out, explaining: 'It is the view of the insurer, based on the investigation, that Mr Howe set the fire because he was angry with Miss Alexander and intoxicated.'

Mr Smyth, in the High Court witness box under cross-examination, admitted his boyfriend was 'rather prone to having hissy fits' but denied that he would have done anything to damage the house or harm any of its occupants.

'Tony had tantrums yes, hissy fits,' he said. 'I called them Tony Bear tantrums - it was like watching a five-year-old stamping and shouting,' he added.

'The tantrums varied. Sometimes it was just a moan, a complaint. On much rarer occasions it was a full stomp the feet and shout. Generally it was a hissy fit, not a full-on shouting match, a complaint, a bit of attention seeking,' he went on.

'What I call a Tony Bear tantrum covered a wide spectrum from the full blown row to a little ‘look at me’ attention seeking,' Mr Smyth added.

Defending his boyfriend from the accusation that he would have set the fire in a 'rage', Mr Smyth said: 'Tony is soft - he wouldn’t lift a finger - it’s not in his nature.'

Damage: The fire started in a basement bedroom of Mr Smyth's former home in Brighton and made it uninhabitable. Three pet cats were also killed in the blaze

Mr Howe, facing cross-examination himself, admitted that the descriptions of 'Tony Tantrums' were accurate.

'I do have other types of Tony Tantrum. I have lain on the floor in Marks & Spencer completely sober and made everybody laugh because I couldn’t get my own way about a bacon sandwich,' he told the judge.

Mr Howe admitted that he had been drinking in pubs on the night of the blaze to celebrate his birthday and was 'merry' before returning home and rowing with Miss Alexander about 'the state of the kitchen'.

He said that he yelled swearwords at Miss Alexander as she left the house and that the row had been 'on the bad end of the Tony Bear tantrum spectrum.'

Miss Nolten, who is seeking to prove to the judge that Mr Howe probably set the fire, categorised this as 'extreme behaviour.'

However, Mr Howe denies any involvement, accidental or deliberate, in the starting of the fire.

The hearing continues.
