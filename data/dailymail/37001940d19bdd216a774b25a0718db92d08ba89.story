This is the moment the engine of a 300mph dragster explodes in the middle of a race - turning the machine into a fireball

The race car can then be seen flipping over and continuing down the tracks as machine parts fly off the car on to the track.

Incredibly, driver Antron Brown manages to haul himself out the car completely uninjured when it comes to a stop and walks off the track to get himself checked out by medical teams.

Explosion: A dragster bursts into flames in the middle of a race at the NHRA Winternationals auto racing event in Pomona, California, on Sunday

Brown, 36, had been competing in the National Hot Rod Association's (NHRA) Winternationals drag racing competition in Pomona, California, on Sunday.

Brown had just reached the finish line in the second round of final eliminations against Dave Grubnic when the 8,000-horsepower engine exploded.

But much has been done to protect drivers from these sorts of incidents in recent years because of the inherent dangers associated with the sport.Â

Moment of impact: Antron Brown was just crossing the finish line in the second round of final eliminations at the NHRA Winternationals when his car engine exploded

Brown's dragsters had a plastic canopy covering his head which was only approved in August of last year and helped to protect him as he slid down the track in flames.

A lot of the safety precautions brought in are to protect the drivers from engine explosions after drag racing legend Edward Glenn 'Fireball' Roberts who burned to death in a fiery car crash in 1964.

Driver must also wear a fire suits and a safety harness which holds them secure in the seat but can be released in less than a second in case the driver needs to escape the vehicle.

But, despite the safety precautions, many drivers have still been killed in races with 13 deaths between 1983 and 2010.

Out of control: The drag racer is flipped over from the force of the explosion and continues speeding down the race track

Ripped apart: Machine parts fly off the drag racer which is barely recognisable after the explosion as it is propelled down the race track
