The Ministry of Justice forked out more than £2,500 for the funeral of child killer Raymond Morris, who died in prison last year, aged 84

A paedophile killer was given a taxpayer-funded funeral costing more than £2,500, which included a bunch of flowers from the prison where he died.

Raymond Leslie Morris, dubbed the Monster of Cannock Chase, spent 45 years in jail after raping and murdering a seven-year-old girl. He was also suspected of strangling two other children.

It has now emerged that the Ministry of Justice - which is advised to pay a 'reasonable' contribution for the funerals of those who die in prison - spent £2,686 on his send-off, including £15 on a floral tribute.

The other costs included £1,165 on the registration of his death, £285 on the coffin, £185 on hearse and a cremation fee of £751.

The 84-year-old paedophile was jailed in February 1969 after snatching schoolgirl Christine Darby off a street two years earlier and strangling her to death.

The notorious killer was also prime suspect in the murders of five-year-old Diane Tift and six-year-old Margaret Reynolds, both of whom disappeared in 1965.

The bodies of all three girls - who had also been sexually assaulted and strangled - were dumped within a few miles of each other beside the A34 on Cannock Chase, Staffordshire. 

Maureen Freeman, a retired police officer who spent 18 months tracking down the child killer, said she was horrified that taxpayers' money was used to pay for Morris's funeral.

She said: 'Taxpayers' money should not be spent in this way on that particular prisoner, especially buying flowers for him.

'I'm sure the families of his victims would be disgusted. Cannock Chase will never forget what he did.' 

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said added that the MoJ should only pay 'the bare minimum'.

He said: 'In circumstances like these, the prison service should do nothing more than the bare minimum required of them by law.

Morris, 84, died in HMP Preston (pictured) after being diagnosed with leukemia. The prison paid £15 for a floral tribute at his service 

'Using taxpayers' money to do anything above and beyond that is little more than an insult to the families involved, and to the people of Cannock Chase.' 

Under the Prison Service Instruction 64/2011 directive, prisons are advised to offer a contribution towards 'reasonable funeral expenses' of up to £3,000.

The MoJ said it considers these 'reasonable costs' to include funeral director's fees, a hearse, a coffin, cremation and burial fees and ministers fees.

A wreath can also be included on behalf of the prison, but not on behalf of the prisoner's family.

In contrast, a so-called paupers' funeral - known as a Public Health Funeral by its proper name - can cost the Government as little as £100.

These funerals usually take place when a person does not have family or friends to arrange the funeral. Local councils have a duty under public health law to dispose of bodies where no one else takes responsibility but can claim back the costs from the deceased's estate.

These services are very simple and usually involve being transported by a van - rather than a hearse - and being buried in a communal grave, depending on what is available locally.

Although the cost can vary from as little as £100 to £3,000, the average cost is around £1,000 - around a third of the maximum grant for a prisoner's funeral.

If a prisoner dies in custody in England and Wales, the governor or director of the prison in which the death occurred is able to offer a financial contribution to cover reasonable expenses for a basic funeral.

Under the directive Prison Service Instruction 64/2011, the prison is advised to pay a contribution towards 'reasonable funeral expenses' of up to £3,000.

The maximum grant is around three times the average amount paid out by the state for a so-called pauper burial.

The only exceptions are where a prisoner's family have a pre-paid funeral plan or are entitled to claim a grant from other government departments, for example the Department of Work and Pensions. 

The MoJ said it considers 'reasonable funeral costs' to include: funeral director's fees; a hearse; a simple coffin; cremation and burial fees (which does not include the cost of the burial plot) and ministers fees.

These costs do not include a headstone, embalming for viewing the deceased, clothes for the deceased and mourners, a wake, obituary notices or an order of service.

A wreath or floral tribute may be purchased on behalf of the prison, but the prison should not pay for flowers from the family. 

Separately, benefit dependent families can apply to a Government fund known as Funeral Payments to assist with the cost.

And another another provision, local councils have a duty under public health law to dispose of bodies where no one else takes responsibility.

Officially known as a Public Health Funeral - but still widely known as paupers’ funerals or welfare funerals - the deceased is given a simple service before being cremated or buried in a communal grave which could have been reused up to three or four times, depending on what is available locally.

Often the body is transported in a van rather than a hearse while the service is conducted in a vacant slot, such as early in the morning, at a local crematorium or cemetery chapel.

A study conducted by the Local Government Association in 2011 estimated that there are around 2,900 such services a year.

The cost of paupers' funerals can vary from around £100 to up to £3,000, depending on the local authority.

A spokesman for the Ministry Of Justice said it considered the single floral tribute at Morris's service as a 'reasonable cost' in the funeral arrangement.

The spokesman added: 'If a prisoner dies in custody in England and Wales the governor or director of the prison in which the death occurred is able to offer a financial contribution to cover reasonable expenses for a basic funeral.

'Prison Service Instruction 64/2011 advises that prisons must offer to pay a contribution towards reasonable funeral expenses of up to £3,000. This is considered to be moral and decent in the circumstances.

'The only exceptions are where a prisoner's family have a pre-paid funeral plan or are entitled to claim a grant from other government departments, for example the Department of Work and Pensions.

'The Funeral Directors responsible for Mr Morris's funeral have confirmed that embalming is standard practice at their business in order to preserve the body should anybody wish to view it at any stage.

'A wreath or floral tribute may be purchased on behalf of the prison, but the prison should not pay for flowers from the family.' 

'Taxpayers' money should not - and in future will not - be spent on flowers for offenders who die in prison.'

At the time, the killings of the three young children sparked one of the biggest murder investigations in British criminal history.

The former engineer, from Walsall, West Midlands, then spent 45 years in prison before his death on May 11, 2014.

He had been treated for leukaemia at HMP Preston in Lancashire after being diagnosed with the condition three years earlier.

But on March 1, 2014, Morris signed a disclaimer refusing active medical treatment. On March 10, he was transferred to the prison's medical unit and he died the following day.

Morris made a final bid for freedom in June 2012 when he instructed a solicitor to make an application for release on compassionate grounds, however the papers were never filed. 

Just last week, more than 1,000 people attended the funeral of an RAF veteran who died without any family or friends.

RAFA, The Royal Air Forces Association, had appealed for strangers to attend the funeral of Keith Ingham Nutbrown, after believing that no-one would attend. 

The 83-year-old, who died at a care home in Llandudno, North Wales, was given a 'heroic send-off', including a full military guard of honour.

Had the money not been raised by the charity, it is likely Mr Nutbrown would have been given a 'pauper's funeral'.  

Morris initially convinced his wife Carol to give him an alibi for the day Christine Darby had been murdered 

September 8, 1965: Six-year-old Margaret Reynolds goes missing on her way to school in Aston, Birmingham.

December 30: Five-year-old Diane Tift goes missing on her way to her grandmother's house in Bloxwich, West Midlands.

January 12, 1966: The bodies of Margaret Reynolds and Diane Tift are found at Cannock Chase.

August 14: 10-year-old Jane Taylor disappears near Cannock Chase and is never seen again.

August 19, 1967: Seven-year-old Christine Darby is lured into a car by a man near with a local accent.

August 22: Christine's body is found on Cannock Chase.

November 4, 1968: A failed attempt to abduct 10-year-old Margaret Aulton is witnessed and police are called. They arrest Raymond Morris, but his wife gives him an alibi for the day Christine was murdered.

November 15: Carol Morris is shown pornographic pictures that her husband took of her five-year-old niece and retracts her statement.

November 16: Morris is charged with the murder of Christine Darby and is remanded in custody.

February 18, 1969: A seven-day trial ends with Morris found guilty of murder. He is sentenced to life imprisonment.

August 2010: Morris begins an appeal.

November: Morris is granted a judicial review in the case of the murder of Christine Darby. The review is overturned.

May 2011: Morris breaks a 40-year silence, claims his innocence and says he may go to the European Court of Human Rights.

March 11, 2014: Morris confirmed dead at 8pm at health facility in HMP Preston.
