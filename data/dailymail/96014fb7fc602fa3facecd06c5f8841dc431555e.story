President Barack Obama is in 'denial about the threats we face' and is 'making grave miscalculations' that threaten the safety of the global community, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry charged on Thursday morning while speaking at a breakfast in New Hampshire.

Obama said in his State of the Union address that ISIS' advance had been stopped, Perry said. 'That is simply not true.'

'He says ISIS is not a religious movement. Again, he's simply wrong.'

'To deny the fundamental religious nature of the threat and downplay the seriousness of it is naive, it's dangerous, and it's misguided,' the self-described 'wannabe' presidential candidate said at a Saint Anselm College Politics and Eggs event.

If the leaders of Jordan and Egypt recognize 'that we are at war with radical Islam, isn't it time that our president admitted the same?' Perry asked.

'The fact is we didn't start this war. We didn't choose it, but we need to have the will to finish it.'

Perry was the guest speaker at the Bedford, New Hampshire, breakfast for major presidential hopefuls that the historic college lauds as a 'must-stop' event on the campaign trail.

Other maybe-presidential candidates who have headlined the event in the 'First in the Nation' state so far this year are former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, whose appearance came earlier this week on Monday.

Famed in presidential politics as the second state to hold a presidential contest every four years and the first one to hold a primary - Iowa, the first state to vote, holds a caucus - New Hampshire is a popular destination for would-be contestants for the Oval Office.

The speech was an opportunity for Perry to flex his muscles and explain why he'd make a better commander in chief than close to a dozen other Republicans flirting with national campaigns.

But at the end of the event, possibly unaware that his mic was still hot, the Texas Republican revealed that he was being coached on foreign policy by his friend - and likely presidential candidate - Graham.

Asked to sign what appeared from a distance to be a program of this political season's Politics and Eggs speakers, Perry announced that he would sign his name next to Graham.

'Lindsey's my buddy. I am a big Lindsey Graham fan,' Perry disclosed.

'I think he's one of the most knowledgeable people that we have on foreign policy, and we, we need to listen to him. He is a very, very bright United States senator, who is ....you know he's carved out his niche, and it is foreign policy.'

Continuing, Perry said, 'I talked to him night before last, just...picking his brain a little bit about what's going on in Ukraine, in particular...[Russian President Vladimir] Putin is, is a dangerous guy.

'And this strategy of kind of strategic patience with him, I don't think is wise,' Perry added, still talking about Putin.

Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina speaks to reporters at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday. Perry, possibly unaware that he was still being recorded,  admitted today that the Senate Armed Services committee member - who is plotting his own presidential bid -  is advising him on foreign policy

Obama said in a December interview with National Public Radio that he'd learned throughout his nearly six years in office the value of 'having some strategic patience' when it comes to Russia. 

'You’ll recall that three or four months ago, everybody in Washington was convinced that President Putin was a genius and he had out maneuvered all of us,' Obama stated. 

'I said at the time we don’t want war with Russia but we can apply steady pressure...being the backbone of an international coalition to oppose Russia’s violation of another country’s sovereignty, and that over time this would be a strategic mistake by Russia.

'And today, you know, I’d sense that at least outside of Russia, maybe some people are thinking what Putin did wasn’t so smart,' the U.S. president proclaimed.

Perry, still miked up, said he doesn't ascribe to the Obama administration's theory that the slump in oil prices and economic downturn in Russia will crack Putin.  

'You gotta remember the '90s and how bad it got in Russia,' Perry told an admirer. 'It's not anywhere near as bad as that now.'

Perry asserted that Putin has 'like $386 billion of reserves' of oil and gas money that he put aside.

'It's actually a lot better now, and so, trying to wait him out is not a good strategy,' he said.

Spelling out how he'd handle Russia's aggression, Perry said, 'I think you have to fund the lethal weapons to the Ukrainian military.'

'You take the SWIFT banking ability from him,' he said, referring to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, and international banking system, and 'go after the 1,000 people or so that actually run Russia and have all the money' - the oligarchs.

Then, Perry said he'd 'flood Europe with liquifed national gas.'

'And that would really bring him to his knees.'

A spokesman for Perry did not immediately return the Daily Mail's request for clarification on whether the former Texas governor and 2008 presidential candidate knew he was still being broadcast when he made the remarks about Graham and Putin.

Graham, a  defense hawk and member of the Senate Armed Services committee who is building his presidential bid around his foreign policy credentials, has also been critical of Obama's 'strategic patience' claims.

'I doubt ISIL, the Iranian mullahs, or Vladimir Putin will be intimidated by President Obama's strategy of "strategic patience," ' Graham said last month in response to Obama's announcement that the mantra would drive his national security strategy moving forward.

'From their point of view, the more "patience" President Obama practices the stronger they become,' he said in a statement. 'The Obama Doctrine, or "strategic patience," has led to a world in chaos.'

'Applying more "patience" to President Obama's failed foreign policy just prolongs failure.'
