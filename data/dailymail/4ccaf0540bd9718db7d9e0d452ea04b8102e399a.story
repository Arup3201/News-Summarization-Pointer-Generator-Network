Thomas Muller has ended any lingering interest from Manchester United by penning a new contract at Bayern Munich.

The Germany international was a target for Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford but has committed to Pep Guardiola's vision for the next five years.

Philipp Lahm will also be staying put at the Allianz Arena after agreeing an extension to his deal until 2018 - one that is sure to see his career end in Munich.

Muller had been the subject of interest from across Europe this summer and looked like he could have been on his way out of the Bundesliga champions when he sought assurances over his role within Guardiola's setup.

But the 25-year-old revealed that talks with senior figures at the club won him over.

'I am very happy to have extended my contract at Bayern until 2019,' Muller told the club's official website.

'There were some very good discussions with the club who made me realise that I am in the right place here.

'I have the feeling that I am an important part of the club's plans. Bayern Munich has been my club since 2000 and it will remain so in the coming years.'

Thirty-year-old Lahm has been the epitome of Bayern's rise over the last few seasons and will remain with them until 2018 at least, adding: 'I will end my career at FC Bayern. That was always my wish.'

The developments mean Van Gaal will turn his attentions elsewhere, notably towards Muller's team-mate Toni Kroos, as United bid to arrest the alarming slide of last season.
