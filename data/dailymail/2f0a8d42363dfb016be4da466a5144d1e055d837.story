LaMarcus Aldridge believes his Portland Trail Blazers side have learned from last season's NBA play-off heartbreak to become serious contenders for this year's Finals crown.

Last season, Portland reached the Western Conference semi-finals for the first time since 2000 - before losing to eventual champions the San Antonio Spurs in five games.

Fast-forward 12 months on and the Trail Blazers are set to qualify for the post-season play-offs once more.

Terry Stotts' side currently sit fourth in the Western Conference standings having won 44 and lost 25 matches this season.

Despite a recent horrible run of form, that has seen Portland lose five on the bounce, power forward Aldridge believes his team are a force to be reckoned with.

'I think the team this year is really good. The team has had its ups and downs - winning streaks and losing streaks are just a part of the NBA season,' he said in a teleconference call with media from Asia on Tuesday night.

'But I think we’ve all grown from last year. I've got better, Dame [Damian Lillard] has got better, every player that was on the roster last year has got better.

'We have an opportunity to win this year, but we have to play a lot better and maximize our time out there.

'I think we learned a lot from our play-offs series versus San Antonio. We saw how well they executed, we saw how they never stopped playing, how dialed-in they were. They were very particular about the things they did and how hard they played. They were just locked in.

'I think we saw that they we weren't on that level last year but I think every player understands what it takes to win and we saw how they beat us up close and personal.

'So I think we get it. I think this team is probably a little bit better than last year as far as experience goes, from the guys we had being in those moments last year. Then Arron [Afflalo] came in and Steve Blake, they gave us more experience and they make us better, too.'

Aldridge, a four-time NBA All-Star, is one reason why Portland have enjoyed a good season so far and are a dangerous opponent in the West.

The 29-year-old is enjoying a breakout season with career highs in points, free throws and free throw goal percentages - something the Dallas-born star attributes to maturing as a player and working hard in the off-season.

'It's just getting older. I’m more comfortable out there, I’m in my prime offensively so I think in the last three years I’ve just gotten better, I’ve just felt more comfortable every year,' he added.

'And with the three points, I focused on it last summer, I got a lot more shots. In the off season I’ve tried to become more comfortable with the three.

'I think with our offence, I can take more threes on the floor in games, so I think it’s just a little bit of the hard work in the summertime, and being more comfortable with the offence, and just being in my prime and feeling confident out there.'

Aldridge will be hoping his efficiency on the court can help Portland's five-game losing streak when they travel to the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night.
