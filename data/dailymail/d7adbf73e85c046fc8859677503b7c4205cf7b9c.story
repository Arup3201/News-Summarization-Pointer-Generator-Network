A greedy dolphin called Monty choked to death after bingeing on fish.

The animal was found stranded on a beach in Gwynedd, north-west Wales.

Marine experts said its stomach was crammed full of fish - with one lodged in its nasal passages - and died of asphyxiation.

A post-mortem being carried out on the bottle nosed dolphin on Hell's Mouth beach

A post-mortem was carried out after the bottle-nosed dolphin was found on Hell’s Mouth beach in Llanengan, near Abersoch.

The dolphin had been tagged by the Cardigan Bay Marine Wildlife Centre and was known as Monty.

Rod Penrose, strandings co-ordinator for Wales, who helped carry out the post mortem said: 'Its stomach was crammed full of fish, and I don’t think there would have been room for any more.

'So when it swallowed this last fish, it must have been pushed back, rolled into a cigar shape and unusually then lodged firmly in the nasal passages.'

He added: 'I’ve heard of this happening before but have never seen it.

'In scientific terms it died of asphyxiation.'

The experts from the Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme (CSIP) teams, a department within the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and Marine Environmental Monitoring described the findings of the post-mortem as ‘unusual’.

They found almost a whole dab fish lodged within the inner part of the nasal cavity, almost blocking the airspace, which would have prevented the dolphin from breathing.

The team, who visited the beach last Tuesday, said: 'An adult male bottlenose dolphin was reported stranded on Saturday, May 3, at Hell’s Mouth beach.

'A CSIP team from the Marine Environmental Monitoring attended the stranding site and secured the body from the inter-tidal zone and a field necropsy was carried out.

'The 3.34 metre adult male was in good nutritional condition, had worn teeth and had probably alive when it became stranded, prior to death.

'The cardiac stomach was distended with a large amount of recently ingested flatfish and a nearly intact flatfish was also found lodged within the inner part of the nasal cavity, completely blocking the airspace, which would have effectively prevented breathing.

'This unusual finding was considered to be the most significant during the post-mortem and the provisional cause of death has been given as asphyxiation.

'A range of samples were transported back to ZSL, including some for follow up bacteriological, histopathological and toxicological examinations.'

Experts were able to identify Monty by matching marks on his dorsal fin to images in their photo ID catalogue

Researchers at the Cardigan Bay Marine Wildlife Centre’s were able to identify the animal by matching marks on its dorsal fin to images in their photo ID catalogue.

Sarah Perry, science officer, said: 'We know that Monty spent time in the southern part of Cardigan Bay in the summer and autumn of 2011.

'We also know from two photographs taken of Monty four months apart that he was involved in a fight at that time, because the second photo shows teeth marks on his fin that weren’t there in the first. These marks were a key feature we used to identify Monty.'
