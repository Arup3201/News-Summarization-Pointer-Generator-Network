Jamie Carragher launched a stinging attack on Liverpool midfielder Philippe Coutinho after the Reds' nightmare first half at Old Trafford. 

Brendan Rodgers' side found themselves 2-0 down before the break as Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata found the net for the home side. 

And former Reds centre back Carragher blasted the Brazilian's efforts in the first half particularly his role in the lead up to Rooney's opener.

Coutinho failed to pick up the run of Rooney after Antonio Valencia did brilliantly to square the ball across the Liverpool area. 

The Brazilian's error allowed the United skipper to fire an unstoppable shot past Liverpool goalkeeper Brad Jones to put his side 1-0 up in the 12th minute. 

'What 'Coutinho does on the edge of the box is unforgivable,' Carragher told Sky Sports. 

'It is lazy but from Manchester United's point of view it is a great goal. Another problem is that Gerrard is left on his own at the edge of the box. It is unforgivable, lazy and weak.'
