Former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin has said she would like to see female nominees running from both parties in the 2016 Presidential race.

Currently filming the second season of her reality show for the Sportsman Channel, Palin once again refused to be drawn on whether she herself is considering running for the White House.

‘2016 is a long time away… that's a big darn deal when it comes to family,’ she told Extra on Tuesday.

Palin told Extra's Charissa Thompson that said she would like to see female nominees running from both parties in the 2016 Presidential race, but refused to be drawn on her own political future

When asked by the entertainment show’s Charissa Thompson if America is ready for Hillary Clinton as a possible Democrat nominee, Palin said she was all for female politicians standing for both parties.

‘I would love to see a woman on both sides of the aisle shooting for that top spot,’ she said.

The former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee was also asked if she had any aspirations to join The View.

‘I think it would be fun to be able to highlight more of the issues that they get to focus on, but when I have an opportunity like this though to do something positive and not necessarily so controversial…Something positive, encouraging and inspiring and not bickering sitting across a table or on a panel,’ she said.

For now, Palin is focused on filming episodes for the second season of Amazing America With Sarah Palin, which is set to premiere on January 15 on the Sportsman Channel.

Palin was also asked about her family and said they were 'awesome' before attacking the 'liberal media' and saying that she would not 'sit down and shut up'

‘There's so much to show… We're going to focus a lot on those who are reaching out and helping others…We're going to showcase a lot of these people who can inspire others to get out there and live vibrantly… It's about work ethic… But still keeping that connection between faith, family, and love of freedom. That's America!’

Palin was also asked about her family and said they were 'awesome' before attacking the 'liberal media' and saying that she would not 'sit down and shut up.' 

'My family is awesome. Perhaps they have some kind of target on their back because the liberal media types they do not like constitutional conservatives… who are gonna call it like they see it and speak truth,' said Palin.

'So they'll do whatever they can to get you to sit down and shut up, but I'm not wired to sit down and shut up.'

Back in October Palin said there may yet be a presidential campaign in the future for her.

In an interview with Fox Business Network she said she was invigorated rather than discouraged by her critics, and they make her 'want to get out there and defend the innocent, want to work so hard for justice in this country.'

'So, hey the more they're pouring on, the more I'm going to bug the crap out of them by being out there with a voice, with the message, hopefully running for office in the future, too,' Palin added.

Palin decided not to seek the presidency in 2012 and she hasn't held elected office since she resigned as governor in 2009 during her first and only term. 

She remains a fixture of the Tea Party, however, and is generally billed as the keynote speaker at influential conservative conferences.
