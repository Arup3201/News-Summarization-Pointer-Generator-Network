Morgan Schneiderlin is ready to ask for a transfer to push through his move to Tottenham Hotspur.

Southampton on Tuesday refused to sell Schneiderlin and Jay Rodriguez to the north London club as they reacted to fans and staff growing increasingly alarmed at the continued sale of players.

Schneiderlin, who joined in 2008 from Strasbourg for £1.25million, is believed to be valued at £27m while Tottenham are understood to have offered £13m and Arsenal were poised with a similar bid.

Going nowhere: Jay Rodriguez won't be leaving Southampton with their other stars, chairman Ralph Krueger claims

The 24-year-old took to Twitter to 
express his anger at Southampton's stance saying his 'six years of an 
amazing journey' at the club had been 'DESTROYED in one hour'.

Southampton
 chairman Ralph Krueger said: 'Specifically to Rodriguez and 
Schneiderlin, they will not be going anywhere. We see them as part of a 
core and the core we’ve got right now and in place is a core that is 
where Ronald would like to go and they a part of that core.

'Any
 reports that Rodriguez or Schneiderlin are leaving or we are in engaged
 in transfer conversations are totally off the mark. They will not be 
sold.'

Highly-rated: Southampton must ensure they don't lose any more of their star assets before the season starts

Rodriguez has also 
been the subject of interest from Liverpool but Tottenham held further 
talks on Monday before Krueger's rebuke.

Krueger
 denied suggestions that this summer’s sales were asset stripping by 
owner Katharina Liebherr and assured fans the club is not up for sale.

He
 also insisted all transfer funds raised will be reinvested back into 
the playing squad, though insisted the club would not be rushed into 
signing players.

Celtic's 
Fraser Forster and Virgil van Dijk plus Sporting Lisbon's Marcos Rojo 
are all under consideration as are Sunderland's Connor Wickham and 
Manchester City's John Guidetti.
