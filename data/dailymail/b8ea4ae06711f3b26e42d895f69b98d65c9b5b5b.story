There is a statue in the Next Cristiano Ronaldo's living room of himself, allegedly carved from marble and life-size. The Next Roy Keane has just nominated Sir Alex Ferguson to throw ice on himself.

It's fair to say Luis Nani and Anderson have made peculiar decisions. But what of Manchester United? The combined outlay for that pair was £42m.

This week, Nani has returned to Sporting Lisbon on loan as part of the move that brought Marcos Rojo to Old Trafford. The 27-year-old's annual wages of £4.7m will be covered in their entirety by United. A good deal for Sporting, certainly. But also an indication of where Nani stands at United after seven years at the club.

Anderson recently returned from a loan at Fiorentina and was reportedly told that he, alongside Nani and Wilfried Zaha, could not train or eat with the first-team squad. His contract is up next year and on Thursday morning, Wikipedia, such is its vulnerability, listed his club as Witnisham Wasps.

Suffice to say, things have not worked out quite as expected, even if Nani has shown considerably more of his talent than his hungry team-mate, who for a while has been a figure of fun.

Last summer, when Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra discussed Anderson during MUTV's Rio Tour Diary, Evra said: 'I bring him his burger at 1 o'clock.'

A joke said endearingly about a popular player, of course, but fitness has been an obvious problem for a player who is still only 26. In 70 starts, he has been substituted 51 times and finished only 19 games. He has scored five Premier League goals and never more than two in a season.

It's horribly disappointing for a so-called box-to-box midfielder, a player who Ferguson believed could fill gaps left by Keane and later Paul Scholes. 

Unlike Bebe, a terrible flop since moved on to Benfica, United did their homework on Anderson. Ferguson wrote in his most recent book about his brother Martin's excitement on a scouting trip to Porto.

'I sent Martin to watch him in every game for four or five weeks,' he wrote. 'Martin said, "Alex, he's better than Rooney".

'"For Christ's sake, don't say that", I told him. "He'll need to be good to be better than Rooney." Martin was adamant.'

Nani's case has been less clear-cut. Like Anderson, he has been saddled with a comparison. It is not something he designed or encouraged, save for his early preference of extra stepovers, but he has been forced to compete against an aura he cannot match. Ronaldo, quite possibly, is the greatest United player that has lived.

In that shadow, he has had significant high points. Three years ago he was named the club's players' player of the year award. He was part of the 23-man shortlist for the Ballon d'Or. He also scored United's fifth penalty as they beat Chelsea in the 2008 Champions League final and won four league titles and a league cup.

But he was so inconsistent. He's been on the periphery for two seasons and scored only one league goal in that time. He was always more adept at assisting, capable in his work on either wing, but the spark seems to have gone for a player contracted until 2018.

He's still only 27, but like his statue, his Manchester United career has stood still. Anderson's never really got going.
