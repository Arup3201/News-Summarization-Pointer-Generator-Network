Brendan Rodgers has vowed to make Liverpool stronger after accepting Luis Suarez had to go.

The Liverpool manager signalled  Suarez’s departure after Barcelona agreed to pay the striker’s £75million buy-out clause and he will be unveiled next week close to the Nou Camp following a medical.

Suarez, last season’s Premier League top scorer and winner of the PFA and Football Writers’ Player of the Year awards, pleaded for understanding from Liverpool fans who idolised the  Uruguayan but who had also grown increasingly exasperated at the controversy he courted throughout his three-and-a-half-year stay.

Banned: Luis Suarez has seen his appeal against his four-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini rejected

He leaves 
still under the cloud of a four-month worldwide ban, incurred after  
biting Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup last month, his 
third career suspension for such an incident.

Rodgers,
 who stood by Suarez after he bit Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic last 
year, said: ‘The club have done all they can over a sustained period of 
time to try to keep Luis at Liverpool.

‘It
 is with great reluctance and following lengthy discussions we have 
eventually agreed to his wishes to move to Spain for new experiences and
 challenges.’

Rodgers
 faces the task of replacing a player who scored 31 goals last season 
and led Liverpool to the brink of the  Premier League title. QPR striker
 Loic Remy and Swansea’s Wilfried Bony are his early targets.

But
 Rodgers promised: ‘I am confident we will improve the team further and 
will be stronger for this coming season. If there is one thing the 
history of this great club teaches us, it is that Liverpool is  bigger 
than any individual. I hope our supporters continue to dream and believe
 that we are moving forward and with  continued improvement and 
progression, together we will bring the success we all crave and 
deserve.’

Suarez, who will sign a five-year deal worth around £200,000 a week, said he was leaving with a heavy heart.

In
 a statement he added: ‘I hope you can all understand why I have made 
this  decision. This club did all they could to get me to stay but 
playing and living in Spain, where my wife’s family live, is a lifelong 
dream and ambition. I believe now the timing is right.

‘It
 is with a heavy heart that I leave  Liverpool for a new life and new 
challenges in Spain. Both me and my family have fallen in love with this
 club and with the city but most of all I have fallen in love with the 
incredible fans.

‘You
 have always supported me and we, as a family, will never forget it, we 
will always be Liverpool supporters. I am very proud I have played my 
part in helping  to return Liverpool to the elite of the  Premier League
 and in particular back into the Champions League.

‘Thank you again for some great moments and memories. You’ll Never Walk Alone.’

Bye bye: Luis Suarez will move to Barcelona from Liverpool in a £75million deal

The
 deal will be the third biggest in  football history after Gareth Bale’s
 £86m move from Tottenham to Real Madrid and Cristiano Ronaldo’s £80m 
transfer from Manchester United to Real in 2009.

There
 were fears Barcelona would try to negotiate a lower fee due to the 
player’s indiscretions but Liverpool’s owners Fenway Sports Group were 
prepared to resist all offers below the buy-out clause, which was 
inserted for foreign clubs during contract renegotiations last December.

Liverpool
 made it clear in the first meeting with Barcelona that they did not 
wish to endure a saga similar to the one that followed Arsenal’s bid for
 Suarez last summer. The only negotiation remained the structure of the 
payment particularly once it became clear that Alexis Sanchez did not 
wish to be part of the transfer.

Suarez
 is now facing a fight to appeal his four-month ban, described by his 
lawyer as ‘draconian, totalitarian and fascist’ with an appeal going to 
the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Decision: Suarez has 10 days to request the full written reasons for the appeal being rejected by FIFA

The
 ban prohibits Suarez from attending football matches, training with  
Uruguay or his club and attending functions organised by his team — a 
penalty now borne by Barcelona.

Suarez’s
 lawyer Alejandro Balbi said: ‘We hope they revoke this sanction that is
 blatantly draconian, totalitarian and  fascist. The right of a 
footballer to work is being violated, and football should be worried 
about that. The nine international games may seem excessive, but the 
fact that he can’t watch a game of football, or train or carry out his 
job, we are talking about unpleasant things.

‘Luis recognised his error but we’ve seen that for FIFA saying sorry is not an important factor,’ added Balbi.

‘Justice
 will take its time but it will come. We knew that FIFA would uphold the
 ban because they are corporatists. We will not stop, we are going to go
 to the CAS and we will keep taking the juridical path that is available
 to us.’

For Liverpool, Suarez is no longer their problem.

Chance: Suarez could still get his ban put on hold via the Court of Arbitration of Sport
