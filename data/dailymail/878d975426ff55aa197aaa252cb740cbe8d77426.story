Ouch: Somerset's Craig Kieswetter was hit in the face after mistiming a pull shot against Northamptonshire

Devastated: Kieswetter (bottom) was struck in the face off the bowling of David Willey (top) on Saturday

Seeing red: Kieswetter had blood gushing from his right eye following the delivery at the County Ground

Urgent help: Team doctor's from both sides quickly came to the aid of Kieswetter who had to retire hurt

Pitched as a bouncer, Willey's delivery lodged inside Kieswetter's helmet as he mistimed a pull shot.

The England One Day and Twenty20 international's injury was so severe that he was forced to retire hurt from his innings as blood gushed from his face.

Team doctor's from both counties quickly attended the incident as Kieswetter left the field heavily compressing his damaged right eye.

The South African-born wicketkeeper had scored 14 runs off 16 minutes in the Division One encounter at the County Ground before the painful blow.

After winning the toss on Saturday, Somerset elected to bat as they try to close the gap on Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire at the top of the table.
