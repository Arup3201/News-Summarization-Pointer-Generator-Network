What do you get for the Rolls Royce owner that has everything?

Not content with the standard model of the iconic Phantom, which costs around £250,000, new owners have been customising their cars with everything from picnic hampers, jewellery boxes and even diamonds.

And wealthy buyers know that no request will be too much to ask of the manfacturer which gives prospective Rolls owners a glossy brochure full of accessories and hand-finished details to personalise their car.

Hamper: A tailor-made picnic set is in the boot of one opulent car

Unique: The interior and exterior of the Rolls Royce Phantom can be totally customised

Thermos: A customer asked for the hot drinks flask in the door so Rolls Royce had to build and crash test the door to make sure it would work

Drinks: The aluminium cup holders were created by designer Alex Innes

A tailor-made picnic set is in the boot of one opulent car while another customer asked for a built-in jewellery box in the glove box.

One buyer wanted a Thermos flask tucked into the door of their new car. Rolls Royce had to build the whole door just to crash test the design, then recreated it on the car.

People that want to use their new car for stargazing, but still value privacy, can get the roof of the car transformed into a night sky with hundreds of fibre optic lights.

The most recent car they have created is the Celestial Phantom which has 446 diamonds. 

Jewellery: This handy jewellery box fits snugly into the glove box

Going on a trip? Matching luggage is another of the 'must have' accessories for the luxury vehicle

Celebrate: champagne glasses and a corkscrew are neatly fitted into this Rolls Royce

Marquetry: Any new buyer can ask for bespoke wood veneers

Diamonds: The most recent collector car is the Celestial Phantom, which has 446 diamonds

An aviation clock was set in the dashboard of another and Rolls Royce offers personalized marquetry.

Matching luggage and aluminum cup holders are also available to customers, reports BusinessInsider.com.

Previously, Rolls Royce has matched the colour of a car to a customer's lipstick and will embroider any logo or initials onto the car's upholstery.

The iconic Spirit of Ecstasy emblem, on the bonnet of every car, can be recreated in solid 24-carat gold and Rolls Royce can source the wood for the car from a tree on wealthy customer's estates. 

Stargazing: The optic lights are arranged at random but customers can also ask for arrangements that copy constellations

Wood panels: Rolls Royce can take wood from the owner's estate to create the interior

Clock: An aviation-grade clock is put into the dashboard of this car

'Quartz: This car colour is one of the many options buyers can choose from

Art Deco: This Twenties-inspired car has bright green piping around the black leather upholstery
