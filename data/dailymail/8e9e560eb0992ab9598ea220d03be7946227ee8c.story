Case to answer: Theodora Sayn-Wittgenstein admitted racially abusing a first-aider and attacking security guards at an Oktoberfest party in St Andrews

A German princess tried to strip at a posh Oktoberfest party - before making racist comments, assaulting first aiders and lashing out at police when she was told to stop, a court heard today.

Her Serene Highness Princess Theodora Sayn-Wittgenstein was in the dock at Dundee Sheriff Court after admitting telling first aider Farah Jasmin Hussain: 'I was doing my nails this morning - I wondered how many Muslims I could kill.'

The court heard the 27-year-old princess, who turned up at court wearing a long brown wig to disguise herself from waiting photographers, had gone to St Andrews - where she received a degree in International Relations before working in Jordan.

She attended the exclusive Oktoberfest party held at Kinkell Byre every March with friends and at the end of the night she tried to climb a fence before stripping off some of her outfit.

She was taken to the first aid room - making the racist remarks before attacking a security guard and a first aider.

Sayn-Wittgenstein - who works in her father's alternative energy business - then had to be restrained by numerous security guards - before police turned up and handcuffed her.

Officers were even forced to put her in leg restraints to get her into a police car.  She then lashed out at police - later telling them she did so because she 'thought she was being kidnapped'.

Fiscal depute Trina Sinclair told Dundee Sheriff Court: 'At 10.30pm security were attempting to usher the last stragglers to the shuttle buses.

'The accused was in the courtyard area. Damon Creevy, a security guard, saw her climbing railings and drawing attention to herself.

She added: 'She started to remove some of her clothing and Mr Creevy told her to climb down and put her clothing back on but she refused.

'She was eventually taken down and to the first aid room. A security guard assisted by Farah Hussain attempted to replace her clothing.

'She had began to calm down but became aggressive again and said: "I was doing my nails this morning and I wondered how many Muslims I could kill".

'Ms Hussain left the room in tears because of the accused. The accused stood on a chair and began to rant about her human rights.

'Cara Anderson stood behind her trying to stabilise the chair she was standing on but she fell on top of Miss Anderson.'

She added: 'The accused began to thrash and struck her several times. She then kicked witness Creevy to the chest and attempted to headbutt Miss Anderson.

'When police arrived they found the accused on the floor in an arm lock and with her legs being held down by security.

'She was handcuffed but her demeanor didn't change. She kicked and lashed out and leg restraints were applied.'

Sayn-Wittgenstein, who lives in Germany but who gave an address in the Chelsea area of London on court papers, pleaded guilty to two charges of assault, one of breach of the peace aggravated by religious prejudice and one under the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act.

The offences took place on March 8 this year.

Defence solicitor Douglas Williams said Sayn-Wittgenstein had 'brought shame on herself and her family'.

He said: 'Her behaviour was totally out of character - she has a degree in International Relations and has lived in Jordan, immersing herself in Middle Eastern culture.

'She accepts she made the comments described and that is of particular concern to her - she has no disposition against any group.

'Her behaviour was reprehensible but she has taken responsibility to come back to this country and face the music.

'The whole experience of being in custody for the weekend was extremely unnerving to her.'

Sheriff Mark Stewart QC fined Sayn-Wittgenstein £1,000.

He said: 'The overwhelming impression one gets is of disorderly and violent conduct occasioned by far too much drink for someone who was unble to properly deal with that level of intake.

'I deal with you in the same way as I would deal with anyone who behaves in this way. These comments you made are unacceptable - they would cause nothing but division, concern and unhappiness.'

Sayn-Wittgenstein made no comment as she left court.  She left with her head covered in a coat and her father, Prince Ludwig, covering her with an umbrella.

The family are German aristocracy  - but not official Royalty. 

Descendants of German royal families 
still carry their titles, although they have no meaning and are legally 
considered part of their names.

From 1871, the Kings of Prussia also served as German Emperors, with Wilhelm II being the last. He abdicated in 1918, following World War I, and the German monarchy was dismantled.

The charity Oktoberfest event is held annually by St Andrews students but attracts guests from around the world.

At last year's event an international businessman, Emanuele Ferrero Ventimiglia, who lives in one of London's most expensive streets, bit off part of a security guard's ear.

But he was acquitted of an assault charge after a jury decided he acted in self defence.
