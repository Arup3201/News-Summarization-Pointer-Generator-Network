Oil prices opened Friday morning down more than $4, signaling fallout from OPEC's decision not to cut production levels.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decided not to lower production on Thursday in spite of dropping oil prices and pleas from poorer member nations.

Around 9 a.m. Friday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate was trading at $69.29 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a $4.40 per barrel drop from Wednesday.

Prices had slumped even lower in electronic trading during the Thanksgiving holiday, where oil dropped down to $67.75.

The Friday low was a four-year record for US crude prices as uncertainties remain over consumer demand and global economic growth.

As consumer gas prices drop, so too does hesitation among Americans to spend more during holiday shopping.

'Tis the season: energy down, consumer up,' said Strategas Research Partners, reports the USA Today.

'The continued decline in the price of crude oil and the resulting savings at the gas pump will likely continue to bolster consumer shares as the market anticipates the positive implications on consumer spending,' said Strategas partner Nicholas Bohnsack. 

At OPEC's headquarters in Vienna, there was some belief among analysts that the organization would push for compliance with current production levels, held at 30 million a day.

In October, members had produced an average of 30.6 million barrels daily, according to the International Energy Agency.

While there was talk about 'the rapid decline in oil prices in recent months,' an official statement called for 'stable oil prices at a level which did not affect global economic growth but which, at the same time, allowed producers to receive a decent income and to invest to meet future demand.' 

Thus no action was taken, with OPEC Secretary-General Abdullah El-Badri saying the group would wait until its next meeting in June.
