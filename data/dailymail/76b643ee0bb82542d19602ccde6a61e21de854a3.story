Eric Cantona's latest role sees the former Manchester United forward play a character called The Stallion in a film based around an orgy.

The 48-year-old, whipped in one scene by a dominatrix played by actress Beatrice Dalle, returns to the big screen in You And The Night, a French film loaded with sexual content.

Cantona, who took to acting 17 years ago after a career in football, sees no risk in his latest movie, though, and the former France international says he relishes playing 'very, very bad' characters.

The Liverpool striker has admitted he may become an actor after football, too!

'I loved drama class at school,' says Sturridge. 

'I never took it seriously as I was playing football. But maybe when I retire, I'll have a dabble.'

'I don't see risks. It's a risk for why? I don't do cinema to play Nero every time... I like acting,' Cantona told Metro.

'I like cinema because we can play any kind of character. I don't want to play only the good ones. I like to play the bad ones sometimes. Very, very bad ones! 

'For this one, yes, it's very special but it's so wonderful, so it's not risky for me. It's a great opportunity for me.'  

The trailer for You And The Night ends with Cantona, once nicknamed 'King Eric' at Old Trafford but 'The Stud' on the film's poster, undoing his belt as the ex-footballer says in French: 'Be warned, it's in sleep mode.'  

Cantona played for Manchester United between 1992 and 1997 but became an actor at the age of 30

Cantona, who admits he would prefer to go by 'God Eric' these days, started his acting career in 1995 film, Le Bonheur (...est dans le Pre).

It took off from there for the forward, whose latest role can be considered as controversial as his time on the pitch, where he once kung-fu kicked Crystal Palace fan Matthew Simmons in the crowd for berating him during a game.

Perhaps Cantona's most famous quip arrived during a press conference after winning an appeal against a two-week prison sentence for sinking his studs into that very football supporter in 1995.

'When the seagulls follow the trawler, it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea,' he said, as poetic as it was infamous.

Liverpool and England striker Daniel Sturridge is the latest to admit he fancies taking to acting  once his football career comes to an end, but Cantona insists it's a difficult skill to master.

'It takes a few times for people to accept that somebody who has come from one world can do something else,' admits Cantona.

David Beckham - Golden Balls has appeared in all three Goal movies.

Pele - The Brazilian legend has featured in Escape to Victory and A Minor Miracle.

Vinnie Jones -  Football's hard man has featured in Mean Machine and X-Men: The Last Stand.

'Especially when you come from something like football, which is very popular, so people have a strong image of you - and it's difficult for them to accept that they like you or they hate you, or whatever.' 

Gary Neville and his brother Phil are prime examples of former United footballers that  traditionally joined the punditry team.

Cantona, though, in his 60 seconds interview with Metro,  believes cracking Hollywood is more difficult than analysing football in a studio.

'It's easier to see a former footballer commentating, speaking about football,' he says. 'Everybody accepts it. But if you go in the opposite way...'

Cantona, told in the You And The Night trailer that he has a 'treasure in his trousers', plays another 'bad guy' role in his newest film and western The Salvation.
