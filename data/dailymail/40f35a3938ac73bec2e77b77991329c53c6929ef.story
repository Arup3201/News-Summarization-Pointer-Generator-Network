A young couple dubbed 'Afghanistan's Romeo and Juliet' from different ethnic groups fear for their lives after getting married. 

Zakiam, 18, and Mohammad Ali, 21, now live together following their nuptials, but they still need round-the-clock protection for fear that they might be attacked by those who oppose the marriage.

The couple, who grew up on neighbouring farms have been together for four years, but eloped because her family did not approve of their marriage. 

A young couple dubbed 'Afghanistan's Romeo and Juliet' from different ethnic groups fear for their lives after getting married. Zakiam, 18, and Mohammad Ali, 21, now live together following their nuptials 

They were so fearful of Zakia's family's reaction that they even had their honeymoon in hiding - they stayed in the homes of friends and they slept rough in caves.

Her parents were reportedly angered that Zakia, an ethnic Tajik, and a Sunni Muslim, would bring shame on the family by marrying Mohammad Ali, an ethnic Hazara, and Shia. 

After their marriage Zakia's parents reportedly threatened to kill her to defend the family's honour, claiming that Zakia was already married (without her consent) to a relative. 

Mohammad was arrested for 'kidnapping' Zakia and after a high-profile case he was acquitted of the charges.

The couple now live with Mohammad Ali's extended family.

His father who initially opposed the marriage now supports the union.

'I witnessed my sons' suffering. Zakia's family are still threatening us,' his father told the BBC.

But Zakia's father told the media all he wants is for his daughter to return.

The couple are not convinced and Mohammed Ali's father and brothers take turns patrolling outside their room at night to protect them from the alleged death threats.  

Human Right's Watch says that the couple's plight illustrates how abusive and pervasive the interpretation and punishment of moral crimes remains in Afghanistan.

The organisation says that some 95 percent of girls and 50 percent of women imprisoned in Afghanistan had been accused or convicted of 'moral crimes,' such as running away from home or(sex outside of marriage). 

These moral crimes usually involve flight from unlawful forced marriages or domestic violence.
