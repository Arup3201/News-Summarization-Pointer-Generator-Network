Cristiano Ronaldo risked the wrath of Real Madrid fans by attending his belated 30th birthday party just hours after suffering a humiliating derby-day defeat to Atletico Madrid.

Around 150 revellers gathered at the exclusive 'In Zalacain' venue in the millionaires' row 'La Finca' district on the outskirts of Madrid to party the night away as supporters in the city drowned their sorrows after the 4-0 defeat at the hands of Diego Simeone's team.

The party had been planned for midweek but with preparations for Saturday's game in mind Ronaldo decided it would be better to celebrate after the game. That backfired when the team fell to what he described as an unacceptable defeat.

Goals from Tiago, Saul Niguez, Antoine Griezmann and Mario Mandzukic gave the hosts a comfortable victory on Saturday.

'Real Madrid should not lose 4-0 to any team in the world,' he said after the match. His coach Carlo Ancelotti – not present at the party – had also questioned his side's attitude and desire and called it the 'worst performance since he had been in charge'.

In spite of that and with the inquest into such a disastrous display only just getting started Ronaldo had hired Colombian singer Kevin Roldán and there was no going back. He was even videoed singing with Roldán on stage.

The other Madrid players involved in the drubbing stayed away from the spotlight with Marcelo and James Rodriguez who missed the game through suspension and injury those who seemed to enjoy themselves the most.

Ronaldo's closest pal in the Madrid dressing room Fabio Coentrao, who had been led a merry dance by Atletico Madrid's Arda Turan on Saturday afternoon, was also pictured enjoying the festivities.

Others who were not involved in Madrid's heaviest defeat since 2011 such as reserve team keeper Keylor Navas and the injured Luka Modric were also pictured arriving at the party.

Things have not gone well for Ronaldo since he was awarded the Ballon d'Or in January. After attending the gala without Irina Shayk, and confirming the couple had split, he has been knocked out of the Copa del Rey, red-carded against Cordoba, banned for two games and been beaten 4-0 in the Calderon.

His critics will question the decision to go ahead with his birthday party on Saturday night. His supporters will say he deserved the opportunity to try to forget what has not been the greatest start to 2015.

Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo, claimed Atletico's performance left Real 'bordering on ridiculous' as they feature a picture of a frustrated Ronaldo.
