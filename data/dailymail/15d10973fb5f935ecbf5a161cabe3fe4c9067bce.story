Slaven Bilic feels Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling can be the best player in English football.

Bilic brings his Besiktas side to Anfield on Thursday for the first leg of the Europa League last-32 tie.

And the former Croatia boss is well aware of the danger that 20-year-old Sterling can pose.

Bilic told The Sun: 'He can be the next big player in English football. The best. He’s got the speed and the confidence.

'He’s not the strongest but he’s everything but afraid. He goes into tackles and is very strong. Most definitely he can be. He’s not yet but he can be and he should be.

'His finishing needs to improve, yeah, but you know what? His legs are too quick to be calm in front of the keeper. Sometimes he should slow down his strikes.

'He’s coming into most of his chances in lighting speed and should slow down. It comes with experience. It came to Thierry Henry. He will never be like Robin van Persie. Sterling is not a typical goalscorer. 

'He’s young. He’s going to improve his finishing, everything. But whether he’s going to be Alan Shearer I don’t know.'

Sterling faces a late fitness test ahead of Thursday's match after missing Liverpool's last two matches with a foot injury.
