Millions of healthy Britons are about to be given statins needlessly and exposed to debilitating side effects which include muscle pain and diabetes, leading doctors warn.

They say NHS proposals to radically increase the uptake of the drugs are a ‘public health disaster’ that will cause harm to many patients.

The group – which includes cardiologists, and senior GPs – is urging the government and the NHS drugs watchdog NICE to halt the plans. They also claim that eight of the 12-strong panel of experts who are drawing up the guidelines have financial links to drugs firms making statins – which stand to make a profit.

'Disaster': Millions of healthy Britons are about to be given statins needlessly which could lead to a 'public health disaster' if the NHS does not halt the plans, leading doctors warn

About seven million patients in Britain take statins to lower the cholesterol in their blood to prevent heart attacks and strokes. They are predominantly given to over-65s who have been diagnosed with heart disease or have a high risk of developing it based on their family history or lifestyle.

But in February, NICE – National Institute for Health and Care Excellence – published draft guidance advising GPs to prescribe statins to anyone with a 10 per cent risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke within the next decade. It claims this could save many lives at a minimum cost to the NHS as the drugs cost as little as 10p each.

Experts say this would lead to the drugs being given to between five and ten million additional patients.

NICE will publish its final guidelines next month.

But the group of doctors say there is no evidence that giving statins to healthy people increases their life expectancy.

The group wrote to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to warn of the consequences of increasing statin prescriptions

On the contrary, they point to evidence showing they increased the risk
 of diabetes in middle-aged women by 48 per cent and cause fatigue and 
muscle pain.

The group also accuse NICE of looking only at evidence about benefits and possible side effects of statins that have been provided by drugs firms, which could be biased.

The leading doctors also argue that rather than prescribing statins, the NHS should be encouraging patients to lose weight and take more exercise.

In a letter to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and NICE, they wrote: ‘The consequences of not withdrawing this guidance are worrying: harm to many patients over many years, and the loss of public and professional faith in NICE as an independent assessor.

‘Public interests need always to be put before other interests, particularly pharma [the drugs industry].’

Professor Simon Capewell,  professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool,  one of the doctors against the move, said: ‘The statin recommendations are deeply worrying,  condemning all middle-aged adults to lifelong medications of questionable value.’

Dr Malcolm Kendrick,  a GP  and member of the BMA General Practitioners sub-committee, who is also a member of the group said: ‘Who knew that millions of people  in the UK now suffer from statin  deficiency syndrome? Mass statination is a triumph of statistics over common sense.

‘Treating millions at a cost of billions based on data we are not allowed to see is an example of the corporatisation of medicine and will result in a public health disaster.’

And Dr David Newman, director of clinical research at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, said: ‘For most people at low risk  of cardiovascular disease, a statin will give them diabetes as often as it will prevent a non-fatal heart attack.’

In response, Professor Mark Baker, director of the Centre for Clinical Practice at NICE, said: ‘Cardiovascular disease maims and kills people through coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease and stroke. Together, these kill one in three of us. Our proposals are intended to prevent many lives being destroyed.’

Concerns have been raised that eight of the 12-strong panel recommending widespread use of statins have financial links to the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture them.

They include Dr Anthony Wierzbicki, chairman of the NICE panel and a heart disease specialist at Guys and St Thomas’ Hospital in London, who has ties to six firms, including Pfizer, Sanofi and Aventis, which sponsored his research into cholesterol-lowering drugs.

Dr Michael Khan, a heart specialist at University Hospitals of Coventry and Warwickshire, has been paid by drug companies investing in heart drugs to give lectures and sit on advisory boards. They include Amgen, a US firm which makes statins that has sponsored him to run a clinical trial.

Emma McGowan, a specialist heart nurse who also works at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, was sponsored by statin manufacturers AstraZeneca for the first year of her job. She was also paid by the same firm to attend conferences.

Dr Robert Dermot Neely, heart specialist at the University of Newcastle, has been paid by statin makers Roche, Genzyme and Aegerion to sit on advisory boards.

The experts declared these conflicts of interest to NICE. The Mail contacted them for comment but did not receive a reply.
