The mother of a northern California teenager who is in critical condition after being struck by a freight train has paid tribute to the girl's boyfriend who was killed after he pushed her out of the way.

Mickayla Friend, who is currently in Sutter Roseville Medical Center, and Mateus Moore were both involved in the accident on Friday evening near Marysville's only high school. Her mother has admitted that she has not yet told her daughter Mateus has died

Investigators told KCRA-TV that the teens were walking south on the tracks - the same direction as the Union Pacific train. They were scheduled to attend a Sadie Hawkins Day dance.

Mateus and Mickayla (left), were both aged 16. Sandy Friend, the mother of Mickayla (again pictured right), said that Mateus 'sacrificed himself' to save her daughter. He was described as Mickayla's 'first love'.

Sandy Friend, Mickayla's mother, told KTXL-TV in Sacramento that she believes her daughter's boyfriend saved her life.

'She had the love of a young man. He just sacrificed himself to save my daughter,' she said.

'The most heroic thing that any other human being can do on this Earth is save the person that they love.'

Mickayla, who does not yet know that Mateus has died, told her mother while lapsing in and out of consciousness: 'I remember Mateus turning and looking back. And I turned and looked back. I remember him pushing me out of the way of the train.'Mateus father Marcus added: 'I'm just really proud of him and I know that if presented the opportunity, he would dit again, to save someone's life.'

First love: Family members called Moore Friend's 'first love' who was 'taken away in an instant'

Marysville Police Chief David Baker 
says investigators are looking into whether the pair got distracted by 
headphones or something else when the accident occurred.

The
 conductor sounded the horn and tried to stop, but it typically takes 
more than a mile to come to a halt, Union Pacific said in statement.

'Our hearts go out to the friends and family of the two individuals involved in the accident,' the statement said. 'It is a stark reminder that railroad tracks are never a safe place to be.'

Mickayla's family previously described Mateus as her 'first love'. Witnesses claimed that Mikayla may have been killed as well had Mateus not pushed her out of the way at the very last second, keeping her from getting pinned underneath the train.

'It's her first boyfriend, and her first love,' Mickayla's sister, Alithya Friend, told KCRA.com. 'And she just got it taken away from her in an instant.'

Sean Stark witnessed the incident and credited Mateus with saving his girlfriend's life.

'The engineer was on the horn,' Mr Stark told KCRA. 'Then finally, they both looked back at the same time.'

Then, Mr Stark said, Mateus made a split-second decision that may have saved his girlfriend's life.

'They would have both been underneath that train if he didn't push her out of the way at the last second,' said Stark.

The accident happened around 7.00 p.m., and in front of dozens of horrified onlookers scrambling to shield their children at a local baseball game from the traumatizing scene, according to the Appeal-Democrat.

Parents attending the game raced towards the tracks fearing one of their own had been hit, Marysville Little League Secretary Diane Washburn told the paper.

'It wasn't one of our kids, just get 
back,' she recalled telling the swelling crowd, adding that her next 
priority was keeping children from seeing what had happened. 'Once they 
see that, that can't be unseen.'

People
 who were at the game told the Marysville Appeal-Democrat they heard a 
long blowing of the train's horn, much longer than usual.

'He honked from so far back there,' a concession stand volunteer told the paper.

Another said the engineer honked 'a bunch and a bunch and a bunch.'

The small town of about 12,000 was rocked by the incident.

'Marysville
 is a small but busy city,' said a fire department spokesman. 
'Everybody knows everybody so it was pretty traumatic.'
