Sixty eight years on, and the iconic image of a huge mushroom of smoke rising above Hiroshima is as chilling as it was on the first anniversary of the world's first atomic bomb.

It documents the world's first atomic bomb and its victims- who are today commemorated in a peace march at the scene where 140,000 were killed.

On the eve of the 68th anniversary of the Hiroshima disaster, a parade of light past the Atomic Bomb dome is the first commemorative event in a series to mark one of the country's most devastating events.

March for peace: People old and young join together holding lanterns to commemorate the eve of the Hiroshima disaster

Remembrance: Hiroshima locals parade past the Atomic Bomb Dome on the site of the bombing during their lantern parade in Hiroshima

Illuminated: The annual remembrance services kick off with a night time walk. The iconic dome was illuminated while hundreds gathered around it

Chilling: The image of the mushroom cloud rising about the Japanese city at the end of the Second World War shocked the world

The Atomic Bomb Dome was illumiated tonight as people, with lanterns in their hands, march in the prayer for peace.

Shinto priests and Buddhist monks parade in prayers around the site to remember the disaster that came at the end of the Second World war.

Tomorrow, a solemn gathering that is repeated every year before the skeletal dome of a bomb-ravaged building.

The bomb was the first atomic bomb ever dropped. The bomb, released from a United States B29 bomber Enola Gay was dispatched under orders of President Harry Truman.

Devastating: The blast, which resulted in a death toll of some 140,000, is commemorated every year

Solemn: Shinto priests and Buddhist monks parade in prayers around the illuminated Atomic Bomb Dome

Wreckage: The mangled framework of the Dome, which was once the Museum of Sciene and Industry, was the only structure to remain after the atomic bomb was dropped

It contained the equivalent of 
between 12 and 15,000 tons of TNT and devastated an area of five square 
miles and more than 60 per cent of the buildings in the city were 
destroyed.

More than 
140,000 people were killed out of the city's population of 350,000 
including military personell and those who later died from radiation.

Many have also suffered long-term sickness and disability. Another atomic blast in Nagasaki three days later killed 70,000 more.

In prayer: Buddist monks on their knees give thought to the atomic bomb victims and their families

Deep in thought: Tens of thousands flock to the city to observe a respectful minute of silence, which will take place tomorrow on the anniversary

Symbol: Masaki Namikawa, 11, left, and Keita Deguchi, 9, hang a bundle of paper cranes to add to the thousands that represent peace at Hiroshima Memorial Peace Park
