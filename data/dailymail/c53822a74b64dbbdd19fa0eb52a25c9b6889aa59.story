When, just a few weeks ago, the impossibly glamorous Kate O’Mara succumbed to ovarian cancer,  the showbusiness world united to lavish praise not just on her striking looks, but a screen presence who lit up some of the most popular television dramas ever broadcast.

She had travelled a long way from a childhood in wartime Leicester to the Hollywood glamour of Dynasty.

But for all the acclaim, it was also a journey that left an indelible mark of sadness on the actress, a grief she tried to keep secret not just from her fans, but her closest family.

Notably after her death, there was no moving tribute from the 74-year-old’s sole surviving son, Christopher Linde – nor was he invited to the family funeral.

In fact, the child O’Mara bore as a struggling young actress was  a stranger to her and - as The Mail on Sunday has established – she nursed a bitter grievance towards him until her dying day.

An impassioned letter written by the actress, and never seen before now, accuses Linde of  terrorising her, and claims that the revelation of his existence pushed her into severe depression and drove her father, a former RAF flight instructor, to an early grave.

Linde, in turn, blames his mother for abandoning him twice – at birth and as a young man. Today, the 48-year-old leads a squalid existence in a rundown housing association flat in Redhill, Surrey.

Uninterested: Kate O'Mara said she had been 'blackmailed' by her secret son - while he has called her the 'worst mother ever'

Plagued by ill-health and agoraphobia, he exists on benefits – and is likely to do so for some time.

The actress’s will, published last week, leaves him not a penny from her £350,000 estate.

It is a decisive confirmation of  their estrangement.

Instead, O’Mara left a £10,000 legacy to the Actors’ Benevolent Fund and, after the funeral and legal fees, the remainder to her younger sister Belinda Cochrane, a former actress.

Mrs Cochrane’s husband Michael plays retired farmer Oliver Sterling on Radio 4’s The Archers.

The very private drama of mother and son began on May 12, 1965, when O’Mara gave birth to an illegitimate child, the product of a brief liaison with actor David Orchard. The two had met on the set of television series No Hiding Place.

Times were hard. O’Mara was living in shared rented rooms and was already a single mother when she gave birth to Christopher. Bringing up two children on her own would, she felt, be impossible.

So with her own parents still unaware that he existed, the baby boy was adopted by a married couple called Derek and Joy Linde.

There the story might have ended. But at 18, Linde discovered the identity of his birth mother, and, after his then-girlfriend wrote to the actress in 1985, he and O’Mara were briefly - and tragically - reunited.

They met on a handful of occasions, but when the news of her illegitimate son broke, O’Mara blamed Linde for speaking to the media. The pair fell out and never spoke again.

Now a shambling figure with long, unkempt grey hair, Linde rarely leaves his flat, where he is surrounded by prescription drugs for depression and his neurological disorder.

He feels little sympathy for the plight of his mother and expresses no shock that he was left out of her will. ‘I’m not shocked, I’m not surprised at all,’ he says. ‘I hadn’t expected her to leave me anything.

‘She didn’t know what sort of person I was – she never even attempted to get to know me. It’s crazy because I’m a perfectly civilised human being. The money might have helped with treatment.

‘But it doesn’t really make any difference to me now. What would have made a difference is if she hadn’t given me up when I was a day old.

‘If she had just been a normal person, that would have helped. She even got the date of my birth wrong in her autobiography. She said I was born in 1966 and I wasn’t. I was born in May 1965.’

He and Kate met shortly before she joined the cast of Dynasty as Caress Morell, the sister of Alexis Carrington, played by Joan Collins, in the hit saga about the wealthy Carrington family.

Linde recalls his first encounter with his mother: ‘I was nervous. She didn’t say a lot. She didn’t seem to understand why I wanted to know who my dad was, or why I wanted to know where I came from.

‘I remember her not being particularly interested in me or what I was doing. I do remember her crying a bit but I was never made to feel at ease. There was no warmth, no empathy.

‘It was really awkward. I’m a working-class kid and I’m down-to-earth. But she wasn’t down-to-earth at  all. She was very “One does this, one does that, blah, blah, blah”. It was all very affected.

‘But I was polite. She didn’t seem interested in anything such as who I was and where I was from.’

The second time Linde met his mother briefly in a cafe, and the next day she came to his council flat then and brought him to her home in Farnham, Surrey.

He says: ‘She didn’t seem to want to tell me who my dad was until the last time I met her and she told me his name. That time she came to my flat and drove me down to her cottage.

‘But she treated me like I was a member of her fan club. I can remember coming home with glossy pictures of her. I thought, “What do I want these for?” I met her sister briefly and she was all right.

When I found out Kate had died I felt nothing. I couldn’t cry. How can you cry for someone who gave you away, who never thought anything about you and left you to a horrible life? Where is the maternal instinct in that?

‘I don’t feel like her child. It is ironic that she died on Mother’s Day. She was the worst mother ever.’

Linde did not realise the extent of his mother’s rejection until The Mail on Sunday showed him the letter, which made it clear she wanted nothing more to do with him.

The letter, which has never been published, denounced  him as a ‘criminal’ following his arrest for attempting to steal a duvet from M&S. It also bemoaned that the revelation about her giving away an illegitimate son could scupper her career in the United States.

O’Mara wrote: ‘I was menaced, emotionally blackmailed, threatened and terrorised by Christopher Linde, who as everyone now knows, has a criminal record.

‘Understandably, I now have no contact with him.

‘The disclosure of such an intensely private matter, my own personal grief, a grief I share with no one (not even my family) was, to say  the least, traumatic.

‘My father suffered a minor stroke, followed by several more. He died 18 months later, never having recovered from the shock. My mother suffered a fibrillation of the heart, resulting in a blood clot forming in her left eye.

‘When this healed, scar tissue was left, causing her to go blind in that eye.

‘My entire family were subjected to extreme distress.  As was I. I must reiterate the distress I suffered as a result of the disclosure. I became severely depressed.’

Linde chain-smokes nervously as he denies harassing his mother, saying: ‘I did not blackmail her.

‘And if I menaced her, why did she meet me again? Yes I called her up but that is what any child would do. My life is horrible. I have no family or support. I am all alone. I was abandoned by my mother not once, but twice.’

Linde says that he had got on well with his half-brother Dickon, who had worked as a stage manager and a theatre set designer.

He says: ‘He was dating Jenny Agutter and I remember we all played Trivial Pursuit and drank port in her South Kensington flat.’

The reason for the relatively modest size of Kate’s estate, which was just above the inheritance tax threshold, is not known.

However, in an interview before falling ill, the actress said that her TV work had dried up in recent years. In her younger days she had appeared in shows including Howards’ Way, Doctor Who and Triangle, a North Sea ferry soap opera.

Mother and son were never reconciled, even after Christopher’s half-brother was found hanged in December 2012 in the garage at their mother’s home in Long Marston near Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire.

Dickon killed himself after fighting depression and addiction problems for year. He had suffered brain damage when he was hit by a car in 2010 while walking his dog in fog.

Mrs Cochrane, 68, refused  to comment about the will when contacted by The Mail on Sunday, saying only: ‘I don’t want to talk about it at all thank you very much. I’m sorry, but it is all a bit raw.’

But for Linde there is no forgetting: ‘What kind of woman hands over her newborn child to a foster mother and then agrees to have him adopted when she knows nothing about the adoptive parents?

‘I feel nothing for her.’
