Militants linked to Al Qaeda have been captured by Philippine security forces, one of whom was allegedly involved in the kidnappings of an American teenager and Australian ex-soldier.

Police and army troops captured Jimmy Nurilla and Bakrin Haris on Monday in a raid on their hideout in Sangali village in the southern port city of Zamboanga in a volatile region where the Abu Sayyaf group has carried out kidnappings for ransom, bombings, extortion and other acts of banditry. One other militant escaped during the raid, police said.

The Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission said without elaborating that the militants were in possession of explosives and rebel documents when arrested.

Nurilla was believed to be involved in a number of kidnappings, including of Kevin Lunsmann, an American who was 14 when he escaped from his captors in 2011 after five months in captivity on Basilan island, near Zamboanga.

The militant also has been suspected of involvement in the kidnapping of Warren Rodwell, a former Australian soldier who was freed near the southern Pagadian city in March last year after 15 months of jungle captivity, according to the commission.

Ransom kidnappings have long been a problem in the southern Philippines and have been blamed mostly on the Abu Sayyaf, an al-Qaeda-linked group on a list of U.S. terrorist organizations, and its allied armed groups.

The Abu Sayyaf, which currently has about 300 armed fighters, was organized in the early 1990s in Basilan, about 550 miles south of Manila. With an unwieldy collective of preachers and outlaws, it vowed to wage jihad, or holy war, but lost its key leaders early in combat, sending it on a violent path of extremism and criminality.

Kevin and his mother Gerfa, from Lynchburg, Virginia, were taken hostage on their summer vacation by Abu Sayyaf.

The pair were visiting Gerfa's native country and were due to return home the following day when they were kidnapped at gunpoint.

They were held for more than two months in a 5ft by 6ft wooden cage when Gerfa was freed. Kevin then made his escape two-and-a-half months later.

He managed to sneak past guards and fled to the coast overnight, where he came across farmers, who contacted the military.

Mr Rodwell, a father-of-three, was abducted at gunpoint on December 5, 2011, from his home in Ipil by Abu Sayyaf. He spent 15 months in the jungle with his captors before he was eventually freed for a ransom.
