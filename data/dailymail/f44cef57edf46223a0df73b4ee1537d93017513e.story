Legendary Italian goalkeper Gianluigi Buffon has been ruled out of his country's important Euro 2016 qualifier against Bulgaria on Satuday night with flu and is a doubt for their friendly against England in Turin on Tuesday.

Buffon, 37, was left back at his hotel as his team-mates arrived at the National Stadium in Sofia with Paris St Germain No1 Salvatore Sirigu named in Antonio Conte's starting XI.

The Azzurri will be skippered in Buffon's absence by Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini, famous for being the victim of Luis Suarez's bite at last summer's World Cup.

Buffon's illness is the latest piece of bad news for Conte who has been blamed by Juventus fans for over-training his players and causing midfielder Claudio Marchisio to sprain his knee in training on Friday.

Marchisio is ruled out for an estimated two weeks though earlier reports that he had suffered knee ligament damage appear exaggerated.

Conte received death threats on the internet following Marchisio's injury according to the Italian federation president Carlo Tavecchio.

Buffon was all set to start in goal on Saturday night, but has now pulled out through illness

The news comes as a further blow to Italy manager Antonio Conte, who has received death threats this week

Italy are unbeaten in six matches under former Juventus coach Conte since he replaced Cesare Prandelli after the World Cup.

They have 10 points from four matches and hot favourites to qualify from their group for the finals alongside Croatia or Norway.
