Most travellers will have experienced the frustration of being disconnected from the internet when abroad – or facing expensive hotel Wi-Fi charges to go online.

But those days are set to be consigned to the recycle bin of history thanks to a new free Android app called Be-Bound that connects users to the web even when there’s no data connectivity.

It doesn’t need a Wi-Fi signal, 3G or 4G to work, but instead moves information around on the 2G network, the same bandwidth used to send text messages.

Features: Be-Bound allows users to access their email, the stock exhange, Twitter, weather reports and more

Data from the web is compressed on cloud servers, then sent to smartphones via very low bandwidth text messages.

The app, which launched in the UK on October 21, includes built-in applications for email, weather report, news, stocks quotes, geolocation services and even Twitter.

‘We
 started with a simple observation: everybody has faced connection 
issues, even in covered areas like trains, subways, indoor buildings or 
any other areas with poor or limited connectivity,’ said Albert Szulman,
 CEO of Paris-based Be-Bound.

‘We aim to connect the world. There’s no plan or contract, you buy credits, and use it.’ 

Be-Bound’s app requires no infrastructure investment and will eventually works with every phone carrier in the world.

Will it Be a hit? The Be-Bound app doesn't need a Wi-Fi signal, 3G or 4G to work, but instead moves information around on the 2G network

The service is free when there’s a data network available, with users having to spend prepaid messaging credits called Be-miles when there isn't.

The price for 80 Be-miles is currently £4.30. 'Light' apps like the stock exchange or weather use one Be-Mile, apps that use up more memory like email or the search function use two Be-Miles or more.

It's Bound to be popular.
