As the death toll continues to grow steadily in Syria, an aid agency working in the conflict zone has said that doctors are being murdered to stop wounded getting treated.

In a report released by  International Rescue Committee's Commission on Syrian Refugees, they said that partner organisations which provide emergency medical services and supplies say the health care system has been decimated.

Physicians
described 'intimidation, torture and the targeted killing of doctors 
and other medical staff in retribution for treating the wounded'.

Death toll: People gather at a site hit by what activists said was missiles fired by a Syrian Air Force fighter jet at the souk of Azaz, north of Aleppo

Injured: A Free Syrian Army Fighter, covered with blood, walks along a street. The UN said more than 60,000 have been killed in the uprising since March 2011

Hit: Civilians and a Free Syrian Army fighter gather at a site hit by what activists said were missiles fired by a Syrian Air Force fighter jet

'A systematic campaign to restrict access to life-saving 
health care through the strategic bombing and forced closure of 
hospitals and health care facilities,' was described in the report.

The aid agency said the near two-year uprising and civil war has brought the Middle East into a new 'human displacement tragedy.'

The UN estimates that more than 60,000 people have been killed in the uprising, which began in March 2011.

'Current assistance levels are 
drastically insufficient to address existing needs, let alone the barest
requirements to respond to a lengthy humanitarian emergency and 
post-conflict recovery,' the humanitarian organisation says in its 
report Syria: A Regional Crisis.

Escape: More than 600,000 Syrians have fled so far to overburdened neighbouring countries

Help: Men transport a body to hospital. Physicians described 'a systematic campaign to restrict access to life-saving health care through the strategic bombing and forced closure of hospitals and health care facilities'

Desperate: Women carry their children as they run along a street after an attack

More than 600,000 Syrians have fled 
so far to overburdened neighbouring countries, and the United Nations 
anticipates the figure could soon exceed one million if the exodus 
continues at its current pace of about 3,000 refugees a day, the IRC 
says.

Inside Syria, more than two million 
civilians are displaced and the UN estimates that four million are in 
dire need of assistance.

The report says Syrian civilians are struggling to survive in communities besieged by violence, chaos and destruction.

Supplies of food, water and 
electricity have sharply dwindled, sanitation in many areas has halted, 
increasing the threat of disease, yet medical care has become scarce.

The report also details horrific 
levels of sexual violence, describing rape as 'a significant and 
disturbing feature of the Syrian civil war.' In the course of three IRC 
assessments in Lebanon and Jordan, Syrians identified sexual violence as
a primary reason their families fled the country.

Many women and girls told of being 
attacked in public or their homes, primarily by armed men. These rapes, 
sometimes by multiple perpetrators, often occur in front of family 
members. The IRC was told of attacks in which women and young girls were
kidnapped, raped, tortured and killed.

Every day, thousands of Syrians stream into Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and increasingly North Africa to find safe haven.

About 30% settle in refugee camps, many of which are overcrowded, overstretched and unprepared for the brutal winter.

The vast majority are now 'urban 
refugees', living outside camps in urban and rural areas, and growing 
increasingly destitute and desperate.

The report says the crisis will be a protracted humanitarian emergency.

'An end to the civil war will not necessarily end sectarian violence immediately; indeed the violence could well increase.

Injured: Nayf, 22, (left) from Homs City, Syria, pictured with an unnamed comrade from the Free Syrian Army, in Al Mafraq, northern Jordan

Displaced: Fawaz Rarhail Turkey, 59, from Homs, Syria, with his family outside a derelict house in Al Mafraq, Jordan, where they moved into after fleeing from Syria

'Recovery, reconciliation and 
political transition are processes that will be fraught with challenges 
and could take many years.'

The commission's recommendations 
include that humanitarian aid should be increased, borders must be kept 
open and the international community must prepare for a regional 
humanitarian crisis that could last years.

There should be more help for Syrians 
both in and out of camps, and funding must be increased for programmes 
that prevent and respond to violence against women and girls.
