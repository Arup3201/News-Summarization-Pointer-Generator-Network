Sami Hyypia celebrated his 41st birthday on Tuesday and received a reminder of his younger days from a current Liverpool player.

Dejan Lovren took to Twitter to post an old snap of he and Hyypia from 2003 when the Croatian defender was just 14 years old.

Lovren tweeted: 'Great photo, Sami Hyypia and me. I was 14, it was a moment that i will never forget! HappyBirthday to a #LFC #Legend.'

Lovren, 25, joined Liverpool this summer from Southampton in a £20m deal but has faced criticism with the Anfield club currently sitting in ninth in the Premier League.

Finnish international Hyypia made more than 300 appearances for the Reds during a ten-year spell in Merseyside and now manages Brighton & Hove Albion.

The Championship club have made a disappointing start to the season, having won just two of their 11 league games so far.
