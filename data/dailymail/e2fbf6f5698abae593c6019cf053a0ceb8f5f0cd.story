Confirming the long held stereotype that unfaithful men lavish romantic gifts upon their lovers while neglecting their spouse, a survey has revealed that cheating husbands spoil their mistresses but scrimp on their wives when buying Valentine’s Day gifts.

The survey reveals that the majority of men will spend will spend £50.00-£100.00 on a present for their wives for Valentine’s Day, but £200.00-£300.00, more than double, on their mistresses.

The types of presents, not simply the amount spent on them, also vary, with mistresses receiving more lavish and romantic gifts, while wives are more likely to receive practical items.

The survey of 3,256 cheating husbands from across the UK, was commissioned by dating site Ashleymadison.com

The research also laid bare the most popular gift items for wives and mistresses, with 25 per cent of men buying diamonds for their mistress (compared with 10% for their wife) and 20% splashing out on lingerie for an affair (compared to 8% for their wife).

In depressing news wives are 17.5 per cent more likely to receive technological items such as stereos or DVD players.

But romance isn't totally dead: perhaps due to the guilt of cheating men are 12.5 per cent more likely to buy their wives chocolates or flowers.

And married women don't need to worry about losing their husbands to the other woman on February 14th, instead cheating husband's tend to play away on 13th February - dubbed by the site as 'Mistress Day' - with 71.2 per cent of unfaithful men 
claiming they would see their mistress for some clandestine romance, with a hotel being the chosen 
location for half and ‘working late’ being the excuse for 50  per 
cent.

Cheating wives who also took part in the 
survey conversely said that they would be more generous to their husbands than 
their lovers and the majority of unfaithful females 
questioned said they were intending to spend less than £50.00 on gifts 
for lovers and £200.00-£300.00 on their husbands.
