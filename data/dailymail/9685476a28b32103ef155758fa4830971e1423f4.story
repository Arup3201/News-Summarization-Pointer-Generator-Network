Former Real Madrid and Brazil star Roberto Carlos has agreed an 18-month deal to become technical director of Turkish side Akhisar Belediyespor.

The Super Lig club confirmed Carlos's appointment with the 125-time capped Brazilian expected to become manager Mustafa Resit Akcay's replacement.

Carlos will sign the contract on Friday before meeting his players the day after. 

Roberto Carlos is poised to sign an 18-month deal to manage Turkish side Akhisar Belediyespor 

A statement from the Akhisar board on their official website read: 'We have an agreement with Roberto Carlos [for] 1.5 years, including the second half of the 2014-2015 season and 2015-2016 season as an option. 

'The agreement was signed Thursday [and] a future signing ceremony will be held Friday at our facility. Saturday our team will participate in the camp, which will begin.

'[We would like to wish] success to our new technical director in the task we wish to be beneficial to our Akhisarsporu and our community.'  

The former Real defender previously finished his playing career with Turkish side Anzhi Makhachkala in 2012.

Carlos was appointed manager of Sivasspor on a two-year deal last summer, guiding them to a sixth-place finish in his first season at the helm. He resigned after a poor start the next year. 

Former Brazil star Carlos retired from international football in 2006 after 125 appearances for his country
