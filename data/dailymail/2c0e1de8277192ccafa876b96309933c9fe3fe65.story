Barron Hilton has posted up a picture of his cut and swollen face, following a vicious attack on Friday night.

The photograph, shared via his Instagram account, shows Paris Hilton's younger brother with cuts to the sides of his nose and over one eyebrow. A towel is placed over his forehead and his eyes are closed.

Barron's injuries are allegedly the result of an attack that he believes was 'masterminded' by Lindsay Lohan and reportedly landed him in hospital.

The hotel heir also linked to the picture via his Twitter account, but with no explanation or further comment in the picture.

According to TMZ, the 24-year-old was taken from the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami on Friday night after his condition became serious enough to require emergency treatment.

Hilton reportedly turned down the ambulance that rushed to the hotel where he has been staying, and instead opted to get private transport to the University of Miami hospital.

The medical emergency came after TMZ broke the story that Barron was 'jumped' in the early hours of Friday morning, and beaten up.

Sources
 told the site that he had attended a party on Thursday night at the same

According to sources who told TMZ,
 many partygoers at the soiree were indulging heavily in cocaine and 
alcohol, however, newly sober Lindsay swore that she did not partake.

The website claims she had even kicked out those who were taking the drugs.

Hilton posted photos on his Instagram from his night in Miami before the alleged beatdown, partying at the pool at the W Hotel, and his page has now been filled with messages of concern from friends and followers.

 silence about the alleged incident posting an image of her at the Shore

 'and no more bad folk'.

MailOnline contacted representatives for both Lindsay and Barron who have so far been unavailable for comment.

It has been claimed that Barron was allegedly overheard talking about Lindsay behind her back, prompting the Mean Girls actress and her friends to retaliate.

TMZ later reported that while Lindsay is denying being at the scene of the incident, they have video that shows Barron confronting Lindsay after the attack.

However, Lindsay's father Michael Lohan has denied to TMZ that his daughter had anything to do with the attack.

It wouldn't be the first time Lindsay has found herself at the center of a feud with a Hilton.

Back in 2006, the pair clashed when a friend of Paris - Brandon Davis - ranted at Lindsay, claiming she was worth 'only' $7 million.
