It's been less than a week since they had a public bust up over Mark Wright but last night Lauren Goodger and Sam Faiers came face-to-face once again.

The Only Way Is Essex stars were both walking the green carpet at the Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 launch party but appeared to steer well clear of one another.

The pair joined a host of D-listers at the London party including their fellow TV stars, Lauren Pope and Mario Falcone.

Hands on hips: Lauren Goodger (L) came face-to-face with Sam Faiers for the first time since their bust up at Chloe Sims birthday party last week

Supportive sister: Sam was lucky to have her older sibling Billie there with her

The reunion comes after Lauren, 25, spoke exclusively to Star magazine this week saying she feels as though Sam has 'stabbed' her in the back.

'She disgusts me,' said Lauren. 'I know Mark wasn’t an angel in our relationship, but I’ve never actually seen him with another girl in front of my face. That was just awful.'

'I’m really p****d off,' she said of Sam, 20. 'It’s really unfair. What’s the need for it?

'She’s hurt me loads. Right now it’s really awkward - I can’t text her or go to Minnies. She’s hurt me more than Mark. She knew I was there in the woods - so how could she kiss Mark when he’d been looking at me all day and bantering back and forth?'

The dramatic scenes took place at 
Chloe Sim's wedding themed birthday party last week and saw Lauren 
publicly have a go at Sam and call her 'desperate.'

Cat fight: Lauren and Sam had an argument after she spotted Sam kissing her ex-boyfriend Mark Wright

Whose side were you on during the TOWIE catfight?

But she looked far from angry as she posed for photographs last night in a black sleeved dress.

Wearing a bright red waist belt with 
patent platform heels, the reality TV star showed off her shiny tanned 
legs and wore her long blonde hair in loose curls.

Her
fellow bridesmaid, Lauren Pope, looked just as glammed up in a green Celeb Boutique 
bodycon dress and peep-toe heels and also wore her hair in a loose wave.

And fellow TOWIE star, Maria Fowler also dressed up for the event wearing a short leopard-print dress from online brand, ForeverUnique.co.uk.

But Sam did her best to out-do the girls by showing off her cleavage in a black lace top.

Teaming
it with a tight-fitted pencil skirt and black heels, the glamour model looked
smug as she told the MailOnline that she thinks Lauren is a 'moose'.

Posing with her older sister, Billie - who wore a figure-hugging gold mini-dress from LavishAlice.com - the TV star couldn't care less that she had hurt Lauren's feelings.

However, Lauren doesn't believe the relationship between her ex and the fashion store owner will last.

'If Mark didn’t treat me right, why would he treat anyone else right? I think it’ll fizzle out,' she said.

'I
think she fancies him because she’s never been able to have Mark and 
he’s a bit of a player and a bad boy. But she’s more in love with the 
attention of it than with him because they don’t really know each 
other.'

But one TOWIE couple who surprisingly staying together is Mario Falcone and Lucy Mecklenburgh.

'Crazy': TOWIE star let slip that Mario Falcone is already back with his girlfriend Lucy Mecklenburgh

When
asked if there was any chance of a romance between him and Lauren, 
Mario was quick to dismiss it simply saying: 'She's not my type.'

However, the pair were friendly with 
one another at the event but it was James 'Arg' Argent who revealed 
that Mario is already back with 20-year-old Lucy following their break-up in Sunday's episode.

'I know I shouldn't be saying anything,' he told MailOnline. 'He must be crazy.'

But Mario was alone as he posed on the green carpet in a pair of blue denim jeans, a grey top and a beige coat.

He shared the limelight with the 
likes of Calum Best, George Lineker and Coronation Street actor, Chris 
Fountain - who all turned up in casual attire.

But not one to let the females down, former Big Brother star Imogen Thomas glammed up for evening.

Wearing all black and bright red lipstick, the brunette model looked happy to be having her picture taken.

Someone else who was smiling for the cameras was singer Katie Melua.

Wearing
an odd layered dress with chunky boots and a cape jacket, she seemed 
rather unaware of the TOWIE-infused drama that was taking place nearby.
