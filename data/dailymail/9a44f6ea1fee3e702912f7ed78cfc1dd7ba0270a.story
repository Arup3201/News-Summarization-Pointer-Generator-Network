A mugging victim left in a coma after being savagely beaten 11 years ago has learnt how to communicate with  his family.

And to their astonishment, one of the first things Leon Adams wanted to know was: ‘Have  they caught the people who did this yet?’

Mr Adams, 35, spent two years in a coma after he was robbed on his way home from work on Valentine’s Day, 2002. For most of the next nine years, he remained in a semi-vegetative state.

But a sudden improvement saw him able to ‘speak’ using a special machine to type responses.

Now he has started asking about the 
night he was attacked, there are hopes he could be able to provide 
police with sufficient information for his attackers to be brought to 
justice at last.

His mother Angela Main, 56, who is 
now his full-time carer, said: ‘Leon’s condition is improving day-by-day
 and naturally he wants to know what has been happening over the last 11
 years.

‘He still cannot speak but the machine enables him to ask and provide some quite complex questions and answers.

‘Lately he’s been asking, “Have they 
caught the people who did this yet?” That’s a fantastic thing for this 
family because it’s a thought process entirely of his own.

‘He’ll never be able to walk again 
but mentally he’s got so much better, we can actually have a 
conversation with him now. Despite all he has suffered, Leon still has a
 positive outlook on life. His state of mind is remarkable considering 
how much his life has changed.’

Mr Adams was attacked on his way home from the pub where he worked in Cardiff city centre.

He was seen on CCTV cameras at about 2am but was found unconscious three hours later outside Grangetown train station.

He had been badly beaten and robbed, 
and his £130 wages were missing. The muggers have never been caught 
despite a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction and the offer of a £20,000 
reward.

Although Mr Adams has only  limited 
movement, police hope his recovery will continue until he is able to 
remember some vital details that may help bring the muggers  to justice.

Mr Adams’s improvement was welcomed yesterday by the detective who led the investigation into the attack in 2002.

Retired Detective Inspector Paul 
Fenton said: ‘At the time we treated it like a murder case because it 
was just as big – at the time we thought he was going to die.

‘Who knows, with the improvement Leon is making we may one day know who was responsible.

‘I’d love to see the case solved. It’s the one that hangs over me more than any other.’

South Wales Police apprehended two men following the attack but were unable to charge them because of a lack of evidence.
