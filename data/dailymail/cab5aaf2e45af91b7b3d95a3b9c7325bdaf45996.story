A Michigan hotel was evacuated over the weekend after a pressure cooker was found while the hotel was hosting a conference for a Muslim group.

Police responded to the Adoba Hotel in Dearborn on Sunday night after the discovery was made in a bathroom.

At the time, the hotel was hosting a banquet for the Universal Muslim Association of America.

The organization was in the Adoba as part of its annual Conference of Ali, which was being held all weekend.

It was the first time the conference had taken place in Dearborn. It is not clear whether the pressure cooker was left in the bathroom in response to the UMAA being there.

Conference participant Kasin Hasn told CBS Detroit: 'I don’t
 want to jump to any conclusions... pointing fingers at anybody, but I 
hate extremists just as much as everyone else hates extremists.

He added: 'It doesn’t matter what faith you are.'

A guest told WDIV-TV that the pressure cooker was found in a women's restroom.

The station reported that evacuated guests were given blankets and water as they stood out in the cold.

All clear: Police say that the device had not been manipulated - nor did it contain explosives

Police gave the all clear at about 1am, and hotel guests were let back into their rooms.

The Dearborn Police Department told 
MailOnline that the appliance did not appear to have been manipulated or converted into an explosive device before it was placed in the bathroom.

A department spokeswoman said the investigation is ongoing and no suspect or motive has been established.

Bombs made from pressure cookers were used in last month’s Boston Marathon bombings, as well as other attacks in Afghanistan, Pakistan and the failed attempt to bomb Times Square in 2010.

The pressure cooker bomb is featured as a 'most effective' weapon of terror in the English-language terrorism magazine Inspire.
