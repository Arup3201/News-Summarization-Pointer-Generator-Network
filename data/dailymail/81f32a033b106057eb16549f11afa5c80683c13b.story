Door trouble: James Allan's getaway was thwarted when he had trouble distinguishing the difference between push and pull

In the cut and thrust of armed robbery, negotiating a door is likely to be the least of your problems.

However, it was a door that led to the undoing of criminal James Allan when he had trouble working out which way it opened.

In a scene which could have come straight from the film Snatch, the robber's getaway was thwarted when he failed to distinguish the difference between the door's 'push' and 'pull' mechanism.

Described by his own lawyer as 'bumbling and incompetent', Allan spent some time grappling with the complex device before losing his cool.

Out of frustration, the 28-year-old took off his balaclava - only to reveal his face to the store's CCTV camera.

Allan then kicked a panel near the door, smashing it in two, and knocked over a display before falling to the ground.

He then demanded shop manager Amanda Croke let him out.

The embarrassing blunder mirrors a scene from the 2000 crime film Snatch, where two robbers make a disastrous attempt at raiding a bookies.

As they try to make their escape by pushing a door that won't open, they both collapse, exhausted, on the floor and take off their balaclavas in full view of the CCTV camera.

However, the door then opens inwardly into the shop, pushed by a customer on the other side.

Allan was jailed for three years at Oxford Crown Court for the raid on the Martin McColl newsagents, in Abingdon, Oxfordshire on March 2.

Allan, of no fixed abode, ran off with just £134.98 after holding the shop up with a toy gun and ordering the till to be emptied.

He admitted robbing Ms Croke and 
possession of an imitation firearm, being jailed for three years for the
 robbery and two years for possession of an imitation firearm, to run 
concurrently.

After Ms Croke had to open the door for him, Allan ran off and was found by police in
 the same road three hours later with the balaclava in his pocket and having thrown the weapon in a nearby 
bin.

Nikki
 Duncan, prosecuting, told the court: 'When he was put in the back of 
the police car he immediately started to cry, told police he needed to 
pay the rent, and said: "I’m sorry, it’s not fair on them - are they 
alright?".'

The court heard that Allan, who had no previous convictions, had developed a Class A drug addiction 
three years previously which had left him in debt to drug dealers who 
had suggested the robbery.

David Rhodes, defending, said his client acted in desperation.

He added: 'It was totally unsophisticated, it was bumbling and incompetent.
 His actions after the robbery demonstrated Mr Allan is pathetic rather 
than callous.

'He hit rock bottom, he was sleeping on sofas in crack houses. The
 drug dealers threatened him with something metal to his neck and 
suggested one way to pay it back would be to rob a shop and they gave 
him this imitation plastic toy gun.'

Allan had also stolen four cheques from his father, John Allan, two of which he made out to himself in cash, stealing £1,600.

He asked for the offence to be taken into account.

Sentencing Allan, Judge Gordon Risius said the defendant had expressed genuine remorse.

He
 said: 'I accept you would not have acted as you did if you and your 
family had not been threatened with violence, but it makes no sense 
trying to get yourself out of trouble by doing something criminal 
yourself.'
