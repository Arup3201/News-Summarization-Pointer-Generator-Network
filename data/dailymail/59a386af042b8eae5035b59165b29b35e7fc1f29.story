Nicolas Sarkozy has admitted that he wants to have another crack at the French presidency in 2017 to avoid ‘the fate of Tony Blair’, who he says has become sidelined as an expensive consultant.

The former centre-right leader came to power in 2007, but lost the presidency in 2012, with some polls pegging him as one of the most unpopular presidents in the country’s history.

Nevertheless, Sarkozy seems determined to attempt the road to high office once again.

His comments about Blair were leaked to the press and were made after talking to the former British prime minister about how he keeps himself occupied, according to The Times.

Blair joined JPMorgan Chase in 2008 as an advisor and Zurich Financial Services use him as a consultant on environmental issues. He also fills his diary with talks.

Precisely how much he earns a year isn't a matter of public record, but he's said to be one of the highest-earning public speakers in the world.

Sarkozy wants to tread a different path and his plans for presidency were also revealed by close friend and former French first lady Bernadette Chirac, who admitted that Sarkozy was going to re-run for president during a recent radio interview.

‘He’s going to tell me off for saying so,’ she said.

Sarkozy recently posted a picture of himself on Instagram, relaxing in a Paris café, his tumultuous presidency clearly a distant memory.

Tony Blair is merely an expensive consultant, Sarkozy has apparently said

When he came to power in 2007, he styled himself as a Margaret Thatcher-style reformer, ready to revive France’s ailing economy with lower taxes, longer working hours, and an onslaught against the country’s powerful trade unions.

But the country experienced continual high unemployment and the cost of living rocketed.

Mr Sarkozy and his third wife, ex-supermodel Carla Bruni, were frequently criticised for their high living ways and particularly for spending a fortune on air travel.

In 2011 it emerged they spent more than £65,000 equipping their new plane with state-of-the-art airborne ovens - just so they could enjoy fresh bread as they flew in the £50million Airbus A330.

A further £2million was spent on bringing Mr Sarkozy's onboard office up to scratch.

The aircraft, bought from Air Caraibes, cost £250million extra to refit, including an ensuite double bedroom and Nespresso machine.

Other world leaders, including Prime Minister David Cameron, have been known to use budget airlines, but the Sarkozys insisted on five-star travel and accommodation wherever they went.

The former First Lady - who still uses her maiden name from her pop star career - even made sure that the very best music centre, including a DVD player, was fitted on the plane.
