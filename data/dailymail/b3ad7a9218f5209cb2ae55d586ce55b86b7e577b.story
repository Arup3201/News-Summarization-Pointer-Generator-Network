If you ever get so hungry you could eat a horse, a recipe book - launched in the wake of the horsemeat scandal - is here to help.

The Horsemeat Cookbook by Chris Windle includes recipes for Pastissada de Caval (a horse stew), Pot-au-feu de cheval (another horse stew), Korean Yuk Hui (raw horse salad) and Khazakhstan’s national dish, Beshbarmak (boiled horse and noodles).

With the help of Chris Windle's new cookbook (complete with horsemeat jokes), left, you too could learn how to rustle up a tasty plate of horse fillets, right

The book - which comes with a handy guide to the nutritional benefits of gobbling My Little Pony - also points out it's lower in fat than beef, and has twice as much iron and vitamin B12.

There are even some horsemeat jokes thrown in for good measure.

Publishers Radom House states: 'Across the world it is considered a delicacy, a lean and delicious meat and a great addition to a stable diet.

'So the time has come to take the reins and get cooking: The Horsemeat Cookbook is a fun, light-hearted recipe book aimed at the gift book market and those interested in cooking with this healthy, low-calorie meat.'

However, it's hard to not to feel the publishers are just cashing in. Why, it's almost as if they're flogging a dead... oh, never mind.
