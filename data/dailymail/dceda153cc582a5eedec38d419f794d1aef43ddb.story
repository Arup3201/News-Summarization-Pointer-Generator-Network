A man agreed to gun down a self-proclaimed vampire gigolo as a favour and to even the score for an alleged rape, a Melbourne court was told on Wednesday.

Male escort Shane Chartres-Abbott, 28, was gunned down near his Reservoir home in June 2003 as he faced trial for allegedly raping a former client and biting off part of her tongue.

The woman's former boyfriend Mark Adrian Perry, 46, and two other men, Warren Shea, 42, and Evangelos Goussis, 46, have pleaded not guilty to his murder.

A fourth man, who cannot be named, says Shea came to him and told him of the alleged rape in 2003.

'It was in relation to evening the score,' the man told the Victorian Supreme Court.

'He weren't too happy about it. The Warren that I knew was a man of honour and it went against his grain. I shot Chartres-Abbott as a result of that conversation.'

When asked by crown prosecutor Andrew Tinney SC why he had killed Mr Chartres-Abbott, the man replied: "For a favour".

Mr Chartres-Abbott, who told the woman that he needed to drink blood to survive and was 'older than the city of Melbourne', was shot by one man as another attacked his pregnant girlfriend and her father.

The alleged rape victim was a former client of the 'vampire' gigolo.

She was found naked, beaten up and unconscious in a Prahran hotel room, with bite marks covering her body part of her tongue bitten off.

When asked on Wednesday why he killed Mr Chartres-Abbott, the fourth man told the Victorian Supreme Court that it was, 'for a favour' after being given the address by a police officer he knew as 'Stash'.

The man said he was given Mr Chartres-Abbott's address by a police officer he knew as 'Stash'.

He said Detective Peter Lalor served a warrant on him for a traffic offence so he had an alibi on the day of the shooting.

The man said he gave the officer $1500 and said: 'Thanks very much. Have a drink.'

The trial has previously heard Mr Chartres-Abbott told his alleged victim he was a vampire who needed to drink blood to survive, and he was 'older than the city of Melbourne'.

The trial, before Justice Lex Lasry, continues.
