A deer farmer has died after being attacked by a stag.

Kenneth Price, 75, was left with serious injuries after the animal gored him with its antlers.

Paramedics operated at the scene before he was airlifted to hospital. Despite further surgery, Mr Price died five days later.

Mr Price died after being gored by a male deer during rutting season on Mountain Hall farm near Saron in Wales

The lifelong sheep farmer had 
diversified into breeding deer for venison more than five years ago, it 
is believed.

His widow Doreen, 73, was yesterday being comforted by 
friends and relatives.

Mr Price was a leading sheep judge who was a 
regular at the Royal Welsh Show. David Pittendreigh, regional chairman 
of the National Sheep Association, said: ‘Kenneth was a super, super 
man. It’s a real tragedy.

‘He had started farming deer. It’s the 
rutting season with the stags. It’s a real shame.’ Stags are usually 
cautious around humans, but during the autumn rutting season they become
more aggressive and territorial.

A friend said yesterday: ‘Many 
people will miss him as he was a prolific showman of his prizewinning 
sheep and was always at the Royal Welsh.’

Deers are usually shy animals which will avoid humans but during rutting season males will become aggressive and territorial

Mr Price was attacked in 
the  middle of the deer rutting season on his farm, Mountain Hall, at 
Saron, near Llandysul, Wales. A spokesman for Wales Air Ambulance said: 
‘The patient sustained multiple serious injuries. He was anaesthetised 
and surgery was performed on the scene by the helicopter crew. 

'On arriving at hospital he was critical but stable.'Despite receiving yet more surgery at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, Mr Price passed away yesterday.

An investigation into Mr Price’s death will be formally opened by the Swansea coroner.

The farmer was operated on at his farm before being airlifted to hospital

The Health and Safety Executive said it was aware of the incident and was making initial inquiries.

Deer are usually cautious animals, but in rutting season, which runs 
from October to early November, males become more territorial and 
aggressive.

It in not known if the injuries to Mr 
Price were caused by a red deer, which has sharp, branch-like antlers, 
or a fallow deer which has broader, flatter ones.

Yesterday
Dave Goffin, of the British Deer Society, said of stags: ‘Normally they
are quite timid animals and they would normally flee if they saw 
someone. However, during the rutting season their testosterone levels 
shoot up.’

Fallow deer's antlers change colour and harden in the build up to the rut in anticipation of being used as a weapon to fend off rivals.

Males will adorn themselves with bracken, roll around in their own urine, and then fight each other in an attempt to attract a doe to mate with.

They will also make distinctive mating noises which range from bellows and shouts to low grumbles in order to find breeding partners.

The Royal Welsh Show, at which Mr Price was a judge, is an annual event held every July in Llanelwedd, near Builth Wells, in Powys.

It was set up by the Royal Welsh Agricultural Society and is one of the largest agricultural shows in Europe.
