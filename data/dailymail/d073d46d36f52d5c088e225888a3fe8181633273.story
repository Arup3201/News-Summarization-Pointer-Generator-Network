A teacher who was suspended after a photograph emerged of him being kissed by a former student has been filmed kissing her in a pizzeria.

John Ramirez was removed from frontline teaching at Origins High School in Brooklyn after an Instagram photograph dated July 25, 2014, of him in a suggestive pose with former student Tamara Stimphil went viral.

In the picture Ms Stimphil is seen kissing Mr Ramirez, her flag football coach, on the cheek and stroking his chin.

Now an undated video has surfaced of Mr Ramirez kissing Ms Stimphil, who graduated last year, in a pizza shop, the New York Daily News reported.

Ramirez, wearing a baseball cap, can be heard saying that he’s waiting to buy a pizza, the newspaper said. He then kisses Ms Stimphil on the lips.

The video has been viewed thousands of times and dozens have left comments underneath it, with one user call him ‘dumb as f***’.

Another questioned why he would risk throwing away his salary.

After the Instagram photograph emerged the Department of Education suspended Mr Ramirez on full pay. He earns around $100,000 as a Dean of Student Support & Physical Education.

“These are serious allegations, and we took swift action to remove Mr. Ramirez from the classroom,” Education Department spokeswoman Devora Kaye told the New York Daily News.

An investigation into his conduct has been launched with education officials interviewing several students.

At the time of writing, Mr Ramirez and Origins High School have not responded to a request for comment from MailOnline.
