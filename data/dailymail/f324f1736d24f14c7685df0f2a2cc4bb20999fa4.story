Appalled: British writer Ann Cleeves says hit Scandinavian shows like The Killing are too graphic in their depiction of violence against women

A leading British crime writer says Scandinavian authors are too graphic in their depiction of violence against women, in a stinging criticism of 'gratuitous' hit shows like The Bridge and The Killing.

Ann Cleeves, creator of the Vera Stanhope and Shetland novels, has expressed concern that prominent Nordic writers are trying to outdo each other when it comes to portraying gruesome crimes against females.

She believes there is a trend that has entered ever more morbid and misogynistic territory following the worldwide success of Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy.

From the opening episode of the TV 
drama The Bridge, when the mutilated body of a female Swedish politician
is discovered, to the first season of The Killing, which starts with a 
girl running for her life through a wood, and the serial killer 
targeting women in Jo Nesbø's The Leopard, violence against females is 
prevalent in Scandinavian noir.

Cleeves,
speaking to the Observer from an event in Oxford where she was 
discussing her latest Shetland novel, Dead Water, said that, although 
there had always been violence in crime fiction, it was now 'much more 
embedded'.

She said: 'I 
especially don't like the graphic violence against women and children, 
often depicted in novels such as The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and 
others. I'm not sure if it's being done just to entertain, or whether it
really is necessary for the characters involved.'

In
The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, a character is anally raped. A teenage
Larsson witnessed three of his friends gang-raping a young girl, which 
he said inspired the theme of sexual violence against women in his work.
Larsson's original title for the first part of his Millennium trilogy 
translates as 'Men Who Hate Women'.

Cleeves
said she had gone off Norwegian author Nesbø's work too. 'I preferred 
his earlier books, which were much less violent. A lot of it is 
subjective, of course. My work is less violent because we tend to write 
what we want to read … and I'm not that interested in gruesome books. 
Any violence, to fit in well with a crime novel, has to have 
compassion.'

Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy has been a worldwide smash hit

Various 
academic studies have investigated the much debated issue of violence 
against women in the genre, questioning whether it is necessary, or 
simply for entertainment value.

US crime writer Sara Paretsky has argued this form of violence reflects sexism in society.

Cleeves
has had huge success with her Vera Stanhope and Shetland novels. ITV 
recently finished screening the third series of Vera, with Brenda 
Blethyn in the title role, and has commissioned a fourth, now being 
filmed in the north-east and due to be broadcast next year.

She
says she is aware families are being entertained by her shows on a 
murder theme but says she tries not to make her work 'gratuitous'.

A
successful pilot of Shetland on BBC1 earlier this year, with Douglas 
Henshall as detective Jimmy Perez, has led to a six-part series being 
filmed now, also going to air next year.

Cleeves
praised a number of British and foreign crime authors, notably Swedish 
writer Johan Theorin and French author Pierre Lemaitre, both winners of 
the International Dagger award, given by the Crime Writers' Association 
for the best translated crime novel of the year.
