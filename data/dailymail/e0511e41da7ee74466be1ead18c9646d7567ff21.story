Disgraced former Port Vale defender Daniel Jones is set to be handed a route back into professional football with Chesterfield.

Jones was sacked by Port Vale following a training ground punch-up with Doug Loft that resulted in the latter suffering a fractured cheek bone. The incident occurred last month ahead of the 4-2 defeat at Notts County.

On the move: Daniel Jones is set to sign for League One Chesterfield

Loft's injuries from the bust-up were so bad it ruled him out for the final games of last season.

Loft threatened to take legal action action against his former team-mate, but has since decided against it.

But Jones is set to clinch a move to Chesterfield, who will play in League One next season following promotion. A deal could be completed by the end of the week.
