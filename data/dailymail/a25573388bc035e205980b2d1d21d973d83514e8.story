Death: The body of violin teacher Frances Andrade, 48, who was sexually abused by the leading youth choir director and his wife, was found at her home less than a week after she gave evidence against them

A violinist killed herself after being branded a liar and a fantasist by a female barrister defending the man who sexually abused her.

Frances Andrade, 48, died from an overdose half-way through the trial of choirmaster Michael Brewer and his ex-wife Kay, both 68.

Jurors, who were not told of the tragedy, convicted the pair of six counts of indecent assault yesterday.

Mrs Andrade had been a reluctant witness and her family said she had been ‘kept in the dark’ about how tough the trial would be.

During a heated cross-examination, the mother of four angrily denied claims from defence lawyers she had invented the abuse by her ex-teacher.

Following one emotional exchange, Mrs Andrade told the court: ‘This feels like rape all over again.’

A week later she was found dead at her home.

Following yesterday’s guilty verdicts, her family said they were convinced her court ordeal led to her death.

Her son Olly, 21, who sat through her harrowing evidence, said: ‘Being repeatedly called a liar and a fantasist about a horrific part of her life in front of a court challenged her personal integrity and was more than even she could bear.’

Mrs Andrade’s husband Levine, 57, also testified at the trial and said she had been completely distraught at the idea of the past being ‘churned up’ and had been upset for weeks after being interviewed by police.

Mrs Andrade told Manchester Crown Court Mr Brewer groomed her for sex from the age of 14 and started to molest her in his office, practice rooms and his camper van. The rape and indecent assault allegations dated back to the late 1970s and early 80s.

She said she felt pressurised to testify against Brewer after her close friend Jenevora Williams reported the abuse to police without her permission.

The jury heard that the police investigation was sparked by National Youth Choir teacher Jenavora

At the subsequent trial, Mr Brewer was forced to admit he had stripped and fondled another pupil – a 17-year-old head girl – in his office at Chetham’s School of Music in the mid-1990s.

And he confirmed his departure from the school – officially on health grounds – had been a ‘cover-up’ that let him continue working with children.

He co-founded the National Youth Choirs of Great Britain and was a highly respected figure in the world of music, with an OBE and appearances on the BBC’s Last Choir Standing.

Brave: Mrs Andrade faced her abusers in the court by choice in a 'cathartic' experience, the judge in the case said

The tragic outcome of the trial raises new questions over how Britain’s legal system handles women who claim they have been raped.

In her closing speech, defence QC Kate Blackwell – who describes herself as a single mother of four – told the jury her questions hadn’t been ‘designed to insult or demean Frances Andrade but to simply get to the bottom of the issues’.

Judge Martin Rudland described her conduct as exemplary and said her questions had been ‘perfectly proper and completely professional’.

After the case, Maura McGowan QC, chairman of the Bar Council, said: ‘There is sometimes a very difficult balance to strike between protecting vulnerable witnesses and properly testing evidence so that juries are able to make informed decisions.’

But Yvonne Traynor, of the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre, which had supported Mrs Andrade, said: ‘It is important that the judicial system looks at the emotional impact on a witness during the cross examination and that judges assiduously monitor the defence’s boundaries ensuring that the trial is a fair process and is not reduced to an attack on the witness.’

Mr Brewer, of Selly Oak, Birmingham, was found guilty of five counts of indecently assaulting Mrs Andrade when she was 14 and 15.

Mrs Brewer, of Rossendale, Lancashire, was convicted of indecently assaulting her when she visited the then family home in Manchester aged 18.

Mr Brewer was cleared of raping her at his home when she was 18 and Mrs Brewer was cleared of aiding and abetting rape. He was also cleared of indecently assaulting the victim as a child in his home. The pair were remanded in custody and ordered to sign the sex offenders register. They will be sentenced at a later date.

Claire Moreland, the head of Chetham’s, said the evidence of Brewer’s ‘appalling acts’ had ‘shocked us to the core’.

The Crown Prosecution Service said Mrs Andrade was assisted by a witness care officer throughout.The judge told the jury in closed court about her tragic death after they had reached their verdicts.

She taught the violin at a £25,000-a-year girls school in Surrey. Her husband is a leading viola player who performed on the Diana memorial recording of Candle in the Wind.

Convicted: Michael Brewer and his ex-wife Hilary Kay Brewer, known as Kay, were found guilty of indecently assaulting the victim but cleared of her rape

Frances Andrade was a hugely gifted violinist as a child whose talent shone through when she successfully auditioned to get into Chetham’s School of Music.

She joined as a boarder shortly after the death of her adopted father, a vicar.

Born in Hull in February 1964, she and her adoptive parents moved to Cheltenham when she was young.

She doted on her father but life 'was hell' with her mother, she told the trial.

Mrs Andrade, then known as Frances Shorney, told the court she had been raped by a family member from the age of eight although she did not confide in anyone at Chetham’s.

Case: The jury at Manchester Crown Court was not told of the victim's death until after they reached their verdicts

As she became increasingly disruptive in class and was referred to see a hospital psychiatrist, it was decided she should live with the Brewers and their four daughters for a short spell.

Several other boarders who were struggling with life away from home had already stayed with the family at their then home in Chorlton, Manchester.

Mrs Andrade told the court she felt 'very loved' by the Brewers as she said 'it was the family I always wanted'. They all went on holiday together and attended music festivals.

However, she claimed that Brewer was sexually abusing her at the time, both at school and in his house.

'A small price to pay' for the affection she received is how she saw it at the time, she said.

Mrs Andrade said her past caught up with her at the Royal Academy and she 'went downhill'.

She said she still managed to excel musically but in hindsight she thought she 'obviously had a breakdown'.

It led to her giving up the violin professionally for 17 years from the age of 23, when she sold her instrument.

'There was a downward spiral that is continuing right now,' she told the jury.

Following the verdicts, Mrs Andrade’s 21-year-old Cambridge undergraduate son Olly expressed the family’s sadness and anger at what happened. In a statement, he said:

‘All who met her quickly realised what an amazing person Fran was. She was kind, loving and always full of life.

‘Extremely talented, she quickly ascended through the music world, winning numerous awards for her violin playing, which has been described as “the most passionate violin playing I have heard” and “perfect in sound and expression”.

‘Throughout her life she had many tragic events fall upon her and coped with most with a strength few people could manage. She was extremely resilient.

‘However, like all people she was not impervious, being repeatedly called a liar and a fantasist about a horrific part of her life in front of a court challenged her personal integrity and was more than even she could bear. Sticking to her morals she knew she must do what was right, to tell the facts as they were and leave it to the law to decide, even as she was only just beginning to see that Mr Brewer’s actions were indeed abuse.

‘One of her hopes was that the bravery she exhibited, and the other stories she knew would come out during the trial, would mean that other students who had also suffered abuse at Chetham’s would be able to receive justice.

‘Having been heavily advised by the police not to receive any form of therapy until the end of the case (a process of almost two years) she was forced to cope on her own with only the support of her family and very close friends.

‘This meant that even after several attempts at her own life she did not get the help she needed.

‘The state of mental healthcare in this country needs reform.’
