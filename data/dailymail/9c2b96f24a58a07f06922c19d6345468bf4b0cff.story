Rafael insists Manchester United can beat Chelsea on Sunday because Old Trafford is beginning to turn into a fortress again.

United lost seven Premier League games on their own turf last season and also against Swansea on the opening day of this campaign, but go into the clash against the  leaders on the back of three successive home wins.

Louis van Gaal has yet to oversee an away victory and United's defence continues to be a source of concern, but Chelsea are expected to be without Diego Costa and Loic Remy and Rafael is eyeing three points.

The Brazilian insists home advantage will be key for United, who have won their last three Old Trafford matches

'Everyone is beatable,' said the Brazilian full back. 'We have to do our best, of course. They are playing well. We're playing at Old Trafford though and we've been getting results there so they are definitely beatable.

'I think (Old Trafford is becoming a fortress again) – I feel that, we've been getting results here and have played some good football.

'Football is about results and, when you don't play well and draw, like on Monday night, of course everyone will speak. But hopefully we can play well against Chelsea and, if we get the result, it would be very positive for us and the whole team.

Diego Costa will likely be missing for Chelsea against Manchester United, as will fellow striker Loic Remy 

Only a late goal by Daley Blind (left) salvaged a point for United against West Brom on Monday 

'I've been involved in a lot of these (big) games. I love to play these games. They always have a great atmosphere. I'm sure Old Trafford will be very loud again.

'It will be hard because they are playing well. We just have to concentrate and do our best, and I hope we can get the result we want.'
