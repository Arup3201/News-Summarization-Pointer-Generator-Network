TV weatherman Fred Talbot has been charged with a string of offences following investigations into historic sexual abuse claims.

The 64-year-old was today charged with 10 sexual offences dating back to his time as a teacher at Altrincham Grammar School for Boys and at a school in Tyne and Wear during the 1970s and 1980s.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said today's charges related to the sexual abuse of five victims, three of whom were under 16 at the time.

Fred Talbot, 64, from Bowdon, Altrincham, has today been charged with 10 sexual offences, Greater Manchester Police said

The television presenter from Bowdon, Altrincham, is due to appear at Manchester Magistratesâ€™ Court on 11 February.

Six counts of indecent assault relate to incidents involving one victim who attended a school in Newcastle at the time.

The other offences relate to four former pupils of Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, the police spokesman said.

Talbot, who was a regular on the floating weather map in Liverpool's Albert Dock for ITV's This Morning, is alleged to have committed the offences between 1968 and 1983, involving up to five male victims aged 19 and under.

The celebrity meteorologist was first detained on 9 April last year.

Nazir Afzal, chief crown prosecutor for CPS North West, said: 'We have carefully considered all the evidence gathered by Greater Manchester Police in relation to allegations from five complainants that Fred Talbot sexually assaulted them between the 1960s and 1980s.

'Having completed our review, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest for Mr Talbot to be charged with 10 sexual offences relating to five complainants, three of whom were under 16 years of age at the time.'
