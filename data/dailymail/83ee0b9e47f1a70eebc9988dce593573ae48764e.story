More than half a million motorists face motorway chaos until Thursday because of the closure of a key section of the M4 near London which led to delays of up to an hour today, the Highways Agency said this evening.

More than 100,000 motorists a day will be affected over the five days it is taking to repair cracks in a key section of overhead motorway to the West of the capital between junctions 2 and 3 in time for the Olympics.

Congestion spread as far afield as the M3, A4, M40, and even A3 in Surrey as drivers heeded the Agency's warning to find 'alternative routes' into the capital.

Gridlock: The Great West Road (A4) is a key diversion route but was at a virtual standstill today

Empty: This stretch of the M4 near London from the West is still completely closed for emergency maintenance

But an agency spokesman said the 
widespread congestion which spilled out onto other roads was 'a price 
worth paying' to prevent even worse gridlock close to the M4 itself.

The motorway was initially closed 
because Highways Agency staff discovered a crack in a 'highly stressed 
zone' over bridge supports.

But there was astonishment that the cracks 
problem was first identified four months ago in March. Business leaders 
including the Institute of Directors are furious.

The M4 will be one of the main routes 
into the capital for Olympic games VIPs who will be able to use a 
specially reserved Olympic lane – the revitalised controversial M4 Bus 
Lane brought back to life and adapted for the games.

It goes 'live' next Monday July 16 – with critics fearing the latest chaos is an omen of things to come

A spokesman said motorists yesterday faced delays of an hour going out of London and 30 minutes going into the capital.

But there was fall out onto other 
major roads into the capital. But the spokesman said: 'If the M4 is 
closed, other roads will be busier.

'But if the A3 and M40 being a little
busier is the price we have to pay for avoiding absolute gridliock on 
the A4, then it's a price worth paying.'

Jam: Even an Olympic official's car is caught in the jam which is affecting thousands of commuters

He said 100,000 cars used the M4 each day – 50,000 in each direction.

Explaining the four month delay, he 
said that the Highways Agency had initially carried out 1,000 
inspections and identified 64 hairline cracks which needed attention.

This involved grinding out the cracks, filling them in, and then 
attaching specially made plates over the cracks.

But while repairing one crack last 
week, they found another crack behind it, yet had not plate made in 
advance. Waiting for the plate to be made has caused the delay, they 
said: 'We need to make and fir the plate If we'd known about this crack,
we could have made the plate in advance.'

The spokesman added they were working 
'hell for leather' to get the work completed on time adding:'We will be 
finished in time for the Olympics. We hope to have the M4 back to normal
by Thursday.

'We expect the ongoing programme of 
repairs will be completed to enable the viaduct to operate in its full 
capacity in time for the London 2012 Olympic Games later this month.

'The closure is a sensible precaution,
given the bridge's importance, both for people driving to and from west
London and for the Games.'

Repairs have begun on the M4 elevated section in west London after cracks were found in the bridge section

Critics fear the M4 fiasco could be a 
repeat of the problems with the Hammersmith Flyover on the A4 which was 
closed after cracks were discovered at Christmas. It didn't fully reopen
for five months.

AA president Edmund King said of the 
latest M4 closure and its threat to commuters and the Olympics: 'The 
closure of this essential artery into and out of London leaves a major 
dent in our transport infrastructure just prior to the Olympics.

'It is a shame that these structural 
problems weren't picked up earlier when problems with the Hammersmith 
fly-over were discovered.

'The repairs need to be completed as soon as 
possible or Heathrow visitors to the Olympics will be left at the 
starting line rather than getting to the finishing line in Stratford'.

Jam: Traffic filters off the M4 approaching the closed section at the weekend. While part of it has now re-opened, one section is expected to remain shut for another three days

Queue building: A section of the M4 motorway has been closed in both directions after a crack was found on an elevated section

Professor Stephen Glaister, director 
of the RAC Foundation, said: 'After the queues at Heathrow, now there's 
disruption on the M4. Welcome to Britain.

'The Highways Agency says a 
crack has been found at a 'sensitive location'. Too right it has: on the
main route in and out of the capital for international visitors. '

He added: 'This raises big question 
marks about our ability to look after what we already have, let alone 
provide new infrastructure.

'With so many of our major roads near or at 
capacity the slack in the system when something goes wrong is minimal. 
Ministers must ensure an adequate inventory of our highways is in place 
and should audit the most critical parts of the network.'
