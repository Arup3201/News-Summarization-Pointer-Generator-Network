Accused: Leeds United squad player Simon Lenighan, 19, is accused of joining a friend in the rape of a young woman and filming the attack on a phone

A Leeds United footballer joined a friend in the rape of a young woman in a hotel room and filmed the attack on a mobile phone, a jury has heard.

Simon Lenighan, 19, is alleged to have carried out the attack with Nathan Campbell in a room at the Etap Hotel in Leeds in August 2012.

Prosecutors told the jury that the alleged victim woke up naked and alone the following morning with no idea where she was or how she got there.

Her phone and money were missing and she alerted police who found video footage on Campbellâ€™s mobile, the court was told yesterday.

Andrew Haslam, prosecuting, told Doncaster Crown Court: 'We say that Nathan Campbell and Simon Lenighan raped her.

'We have a window in to that hotel room. That window shows how the defendants treated and continued to treat her.'

Mr
 Haslam said the two defendants both used their mobile phones to video 
the woman and were heard laughing as they avoided being seen on the 
camera.

The jury saw footage which showed the woman, who can not be named for legal reasons, lying naked on a bed and intimate shots of her body.

At
 one point both men are heard using slang words including 'pum pum' and 
'batty' and describing the woman as 'looking a bit stretched'.

At one point Campbell, 24, is heard telling the woman, 'Ah yeah it hurts too much - calm down'.

Mr
 Haslam said Lenighan and Campbell met for the first time on the night 
of the alleged incident as they drank in the Tiger Tiger bar in Leeds.

The woman, who knew Lenighan, had also been drinking in the bar and agreed to go back to the hotel with the two men.

Mr Haslam said friends were concerned for her safety because she had so much to drink, with one describing her as 'very drunk'.

Allegations: The woman, who knew Lenighan, had also been drinking in the bar and agreed to go back to the hotel with the two men, the jury heard

After they were arrested both men admitted having sex with the woman but claimed she was a willing partner, the court heard.

Lenighan
 claimed they started to have sex but he realised she was too drunk and 
she said no.He told her that he fell asleep and did not know what 
Campbell was doing.

Mr 
Haslam said: 'The prosecution say that she was so drunk she could not 
give meaningful and proper consent. The capacity to give consent is 
affected by drink.

Arrival: Lenighan outside Doncaster Crown Court before the trial. He denies denies three charges of rape and one of perverting the course of justice

â€œDrunken consent is still consent but if someone becomes so intoxicated their ability to choose can evaporate, it can be lost.'

When Campbell was arrested by police they found the video on his mobile phone.

He told police that the woman was the instigator and said that he had sex with her.

Lenighan, of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, denies three charges of rape and one of perverting the course of justice.

Campbell, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, denies three charges of rape and one of perverting the course of justice.

The trial continues.
