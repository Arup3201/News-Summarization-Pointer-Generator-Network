Prince Harry proved he is every inch his mother's son as he visited a kindergarten school in Chile to spend time with vulnerable children.

The playful prince took time out of his hectic schedule to visit the Sagrada Familia kindergarten, where he was seen cheering up underprivileged children from the Mapuche indigenous community. 

In heartwarming scenes which mirrored Princess Diana during her numerous charity trips, Harry could hardly wipe the smile from his face as he played and laughed - and even learned to play musical instruments - with the adorable children.

One of the pupils, three-year-old Francisca, taught the prince how to play the pifilca, a ductless local flute, much to the entertainment of staff at the centre.

He was accompanied by Sebastián Dávalos Bachelet, the president's son, during the visit.

Managed by
 the Integra Foundation - of which Prince Harry is official patron - the
 kindergarten offers free pre-school education to deprived 
children, all aged between three months and four years old.

During his visit, Harry's sunny 
brand of charm also saw him claim a new conquest - Chile's president, Michelle 
Bachelet.

The
 veteran stateswoman and the country's first female head of state was 
all smiles as she welcomed Harry to the La Moneda palace in Santiago.

Harry
 himself looked equally thrilled, with the pair enjoying a warm 
conversation and swapping smiles as they wandered through the 
presidential residence.

The prince, who has spent the past 
four days touring Brazil, arrived in Chile early this morning and began 
his three-day visit by paying his respects to the country's founding 
father, Captain General Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme.

Watched
 by enthusiastic crowds and a clutch of pressed and polished soldiers in
 the central Plaza de la Ciudadania, Harry laid a Union flag wreath at 
the foot of a monument dedicated to O'Higgins - a tradition observed by 
every visiting head of state.

After 
exchanging smiles with some of the military men and stopping for a chat 
with a pretty reporter from Chilean state TV, the prince continued on 
for his meeting with President Bachelet at the La Moneda palace.

Like
 Chile itself, La Moneda has a chequered history, and during military 
coup on September 11, 1973, was partially destroyed by bombing.

Reconstruction and restoration projects were completed on March 11, 1981, although some bullet marks have been preserved and can still be seen today.

He also had a formal greeting from President Bachelet, who took office for a second term in March.

Later,
 Harry will meet Chilean special forces troops in Peldehue before 
continuing on to a party in honour of the Queen's birthday at the 
British ambassador's residence.

There,
 he and ambassador Fiona Clouder will be joined by an eclectic crowd, 
among them athletes from Chile's paralympic team and members of the 
armed forces.
