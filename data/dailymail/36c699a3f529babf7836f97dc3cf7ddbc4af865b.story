Murdered: Highlander Scott McLaren, 20, was shot dead when he went to look for his night vision goggles, the inquest heard

A soldier was executed by the Taliban after leaving his base in the middle of the night to look for missing kit, an inquest heard yesterday.

Highlander Scott McLaren walked away from the safety of his checkpoint to try to find a pair of night vision goggles.

But as the 20-year-old hunted for the valuable equipment he was captured by insurgents, tortured and killed.

He was shot five times in the head with an automatic rifle before his semi-naked body was dumped in a river three miles from Checkpoint Salaang in the Nahr-e-Saraj district of Helmand.

Highlander McLaren’s body was found by British troops after a  17-hour manhunt involving hundreds of servicemen, including U.S. special forces.

The soldier, from the 4th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, had been ‘concerned’ about the missing night vision goggles, the coroner was told.

Highlander McLaren went to retrieve the goggles, which had been left by another soldier at a nearby vehicle checkpoint.

His unit had been warned about the importance of looking after their kit and why it was vital it did not fall into enemy hands.

The soldier, from Edinburgh and on his first tour of duty, later mentioned going to bring back the goggles but a comrade told him there was ‘no point’ because they were due to go on patrol a few hours later.

But shortly after completing his sentry duty at 2am on July 4, Highlander McLaren was caught on CCTV walking out of the base wearing full body armour and carrying his SA-80 assault rifle.

However instead of crossing a canal bridge to get to the vehicle checkpoint, he wandered off in the opposite direction.

He was discovered missing an hour later as his unit prepared to go on patrol. At 5pm, his body was found face down in the river.

David Ridley, the Wiltshire and 
Swindon Coroner, recorded that Highlander McLaren had been ‘assaulted, 
tortured and ultimately executed’ by insurgents.

He said: ‘Quite clearly Scott was 
concerned as regards the missing goggles and talked of going back to the
checkpoint where they were last seen.

‘But the evidence, and in particular 
the CCTV imagery, points quite clearly to Scott heading off in an 
entirely different direction. It is unclear what Scott was doing that 
night and sadly the only person who could help us is no longer with us.’

The inquest heard that two weeks 
before his death Highlander McLaren had become emotional and told a 
sergeant that he kept ‘messing up’.

Sergeant Finn Beary said: ‘I said 
“You’re only a young lad and this is your first tour”. He didn’t give 
any indication what he was messing up. It seemed like he had been 
putting a lot of pressure on himself.’

Grief: Kirsty McLaren, the soldier's sister, is seen during his funeral in Edinburgh. Yesterday a coroner ruled he was unlawfully killed

Captain Calum MacLeod, commanding the
soldiers at the base, said that after the goggles were mislaid the unit
had received a ‘b******ing’ from second-in-command Corporal Douglas 
Young.

Captain McLeod said: ‘I explained to 
them why it was important we looked after our kit and what would happen 
if it got into enemy hands.

‘The last thing you think of is that 
someone is going to walk into the middle of enemy-held territories. 
Everybody was clear about the threat of the enemy in the area of the 
base.’

After the execution, one insurgent boasted how he was rewarded with cash and a motorbike for the attack.

Captain MacLeod stressed that no 
individual was to blame for the loss of the kit. ‘When you are part of a
team, you must take responsibility as a team,’ he said.
