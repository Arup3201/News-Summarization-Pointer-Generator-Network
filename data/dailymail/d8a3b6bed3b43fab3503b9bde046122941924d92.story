Unlimited free alcohol, sex competitions, and 'causing carnage', this is how one of Magaluf's most controversial events companies keeps young holidaymakers entertained.

Following the release of shocking footage in which a 18-year-old woman performs a sex act on 24 men at a bar in Majorca, the firm that hosted the 'out-of-control' party can be revealed.

Carnage Magalluf advertises on its website that it offers travellers pool parties, bar crawls and nine-hour club nights, with 'wild drinking games', free shots - and even celebrity hosts - for prices starting from just £25.

Party capital: Magaluf, popular for its cheap clubs and bars, has earned its reputation as one of the top places for drinking and clubbing holidays in Europe. It is especially popular with British tourists (file picture)

Controversial: Carnage Magalluf offers free alcohol and 'wild parties' at the events it runs on the Spanish island

The company, which has been running for two years, claims it has 'moved straight to the top because of our services and quality of events' - and even brags that it has guest appearances from the likes of actor Danny Dyer, TOWIE stars Dan Osborne and James 'Arg' Argent, and Benefits Street's White Dee.

However, since the alarming two-minute footage came to light on Wednesday, giving an insight into the type of events Carnage Magalluf runs, more disturbing details have emerged that will no doubt concern the parents of children planning to attend its parties over the summer holidays.

On its Twitter feed, the company brags about its all-you-can drink bar crawls, naming and 'shaming' the 'weak' revellers who fail to make it to the end of the night.

In one 
photo, posted by Carnage Magalluf on the social media website, a young 
man looks unconscious as he is propped up by two smiling friends after a
 night out drinking at an event arranged by the company.

One partygoer holds the seemingly drunken man's head up as they stand in their Carnage-branded T-shirts.

In the Twitter post, the company, which 
is not linked to Carnage UK, writes: 'Our Barcrawl isn't for weak 
people... Only the HARDCORE make it to the end..HAVE YOU SURVIVED A 
CARNAGE BARCRAWL???'

Another 
video posted by the business on its Facebook page shows a montage of 
what goes on at the parties it arranges - including scenes of sex acts 
being carried out by men and women.

One
 clip even shows what appears to be full sexual intercourse between holidaymakers - taking place in a public bar surround by crowds of young 
revellers.

Boasting,
 Carnage Magalluf writes on Facebook alongside the disturbing footage: 'Carnage is 
still the biggest and best event in magaluf.. Check out our new video!!'

Tweets posted by holidaymakers after nights out at the company's events claim that the type of scene which came to light this week happens 'everywhere every day'.

Scene: Party capital: The unnamed girl was captured on video working her way through men at Alex's Bar (pictured) in Magaluf. It was claimed her actions were the result of cheap alcohol and a party culture

Revellers
 even brag about getting Carnage Magalluf tattoos - with some going
 as far as having the name of the company's event manager, Alan 
Collinson, inked on their bodies.

There is also a photo that has been posted on Twitter showing one man who tattooed the brand name on his genitals.

Carnage 
Magalluf writes alongside the image: 'Some CLOWN got CARNAGE tattooed on
 his c*** last summer.. that will take some beating this year.. is it 
possible???'

Another video posted on Carnage Magalluf's Facebook page also shows a young man admitting that he lost his virginity on the night of one of the company's bar crawls.

Bragging: The company's first response on Twitter after the sex act video was posted online

The man behind the camera praises the 'lad', saying that the company has been: 'Making virgins non-virgins for the past four years.'

After
 the footage of the sex act video was leaked online, the company appeared to revel in its infamy, 
tweeting: 'If you want to get involved in any of our events you best get
 ya tickets now as sales are goin through the roof..'

It
 also retweeted a host of offensive posts by supporters of the company, 
including an obscene remark by user @ConnorFairbairn alleging that he was in
 Magaluf at the same time as the girl in the video and her friends, 
adding: 'that made our holiday loooool non stop scenes.'

On Friday night, the company attempted to distance itself from the sex act video after outrage and a huge online backlash.

It tweeted: 'We are not responsible for the girls actions. The girl and her 8 friends bought tickets for the next BARCRAWL as they said it was AMAZING!'

It added in a second post: 'All you need to do is look at the video and you can see she clearly isn't drunk and knows what she is doin. Definitely not forced in any way.'

However, Twitter users were swift to attack Carnage Magalluf's stance, with one user tweeting: 'Hasn't stopped you RTing abuse towards her or revelling in the coverage though, has it? Pathetic.'

Another asked: 'Why are you re-tweeting the abuse?'

While another said: 'Virtually no one's questioning the actions of the 24 blokes involved, funny that.'

The company distanced itself from the girl's actions in the video in a Twitter comment

Carnage Magalluf also denied allegations the girl involved in the sex act video was drunk at its event

Footage of
 the girl's actions was posted online on Wednesday and quickly went 
viral, sparking outrage among politicians and women's rights groups.

A
 man called Kieran, 26, who said he was at the club at the time, said 
the girl had agreed to perform the sex act after being told by party 
organisers she would win a 'holiday'.

But
 her prize, in fact, reportedly turned out to be a cocktail named 
'Holiday', made from gin, vodka, peach schnapps, blackcurrant liqueur 
and fruit juice.

'It was a 
game that got completely out of hand,' Kieran told The Sun. 'The girl 
was being encouraged to drink more and more and was told she would win a
 "holiday" if she took part in this game.

'Unfortunately the "holiday" turned out to be the name of a cocktail.'

Police have now launched an inquiry into the incident, which took place during an event organised by Carnage Magalluf at Alex's Bar.

In the video, the men involved in the sex acts can be seen sporting T-shirts from Carnage Magalluf.

Several holidaymakers are captured taking photos of the 'game' on their mobile phones.

Geordie Shore's Jay Gardner, who also featured in the video but did not take part in the game, told the Mirror the girl had been swept up in Magaluf's 'wild, everything-goes' culture.

'This girl's gone on holiday, got fuelled with alcohol, someone's suggested it, she's smashed and thought it's a good idea,' he said.

The reality TV star was reportedly asked whether he wanted to be 'number 25', but declined, sticking his middle finger up at the girl who then walked away.

The company had already provoked controversy after hosting Benefits Street's White Dee - real name Deirdre Kelly - at a number of its events on the Spanish party island.

It caused outrage as Dee, who currently receives £10,000 a year in state handouts, as she claims she is too depressed to work.

MailOnline has contacted Carnage Magalluf for comment.
