The father of murdered honeymoon bride Anni Dewani yesterday wiped away tears as he examined items of evidence at the trial of one of her alleged killers.

Vinod Hindocha was accompanied by Anni's cousin Nishma Hindocha at the Cape Town court where one of the alleged hijackers - who has already confessed - pointed the finger of blame at his alleged partner in crime.

Mr Hindocha stood close to his niece as they examined the bracelet and watch Anni had been wearing when she was killed. Alongside these items was a mobile phone alleged to belong to the hijacked taxi's driver and a handgun allegedly used to murder her.

Evidence: Anni Dewani's bracelet, watch and mobile phone, plus the gun used to shoot her

During the hearing, the South African 'hitman' who killed Anni in a honeymoon hijack told how he wore yellow 
Marigold-type rubber gloves during the newlywed bride’s murder.

Mziwamadoda Qwabe wore the bright 
rubber kitchen gloves as he drove Anni’s commandeered taxi at high speed
 through the darkened township roads.

He
 did so in the knowledge that Anni’s then-imminent death had been 
planned and paid for by her own husband, the South African court has 
been told.

Although he has already admitted his role in Anni’s murder, Qwabe, 27, yesterday appeared in court as a witness against Xolile Mngeni, who is alleged to be his partner in crime.

Qwabe used his court appearance yesterday to point the finger of blame for Anni’s death at Shrien Dewani.

While admitting that he never spoke directly to the British businessman, the South African recalled being told that the murder was Shrien’s idea.

Confession: Mziwamadoda Qwabe is testifying against his alleged partner in crime

‘There is a husband who wants his wife killed and it must look like a hijacking,’ Qwabe recalled being told.

He went on to say how the hijack and murder plan had initially faltered when the two hijackers failed to be at the agreed rendezvous point on time.

It was Shrien, Qwabe claimed in court, who nonetheless insisted that the 'job' should continue.

‘The husband wants the job to be done that same night,’ Qwabe recalled being told.

Anni, 28, and her husband were 
hijacked on the fifth day of their honeymoon as their taxi drove through
 Gugulethu township outside Cape Town.

After stealing all their valuables, the 
two hijackers permitted Shrien to leave the car. Anni, however, had to 
stay. She was later shot dead.

So far, the taxi’s driver, Zola Tongo,
 plus one of the hijackers, Qwabe, and another anonymous ‘middle man’ 
have all admitted their roles in the plot.

All
 three men have received substantial sentence discounts (or in the 
middle man’s case, complete immunity from prosecution) in return for 
evidence fingering Shrien, whom the South African prosecution claim 
masterminded Anni’s murder.

Like Mngeni, Shrien insists he is innocent.

All that's left: Anni's possessions displayed at the trial included a delicate watch and bangle

Silent witness: The murdered bride's mobile phone was also handed in as evidence

Grieving: The pair at the court yesterday, left, and today, right. Mngeni is accused of pulling the trigger on their relative but he denies kidnapping, robbery, murder and owning an unlicensed gun

Giving evidence yesterday, Qwabe told how the two friends had agreed with Zola Tongo to kill Anni for a share of £1,335.They met up with Tongo on the afternoon of the murder - 13th November, 2010 - to arrange details.

Tragedy: Anni Dewani died on her honeymoon in South Africa tow years ago

It was Mngeni, Qwabe claimed, who carried pointed his 7.62mm handgun at the Dewani’s taxi as part of the pretend hijack plan.

Under questioning from prosecutor Adrian Mopp, Qwabe revealed that he wore yellow rubber gloves as drove the VW Sharan at speed through the township.

‘The type that people wear for washing dishes?, asked Mr Mopp. ‘Yes’, said Qwabe.

According to Qwabe, it was Mngeni, who was sitting beside him in the passenger seat, who turned around and shot Anni in the neck.

Anni’s bereaved father Vinod Hindocha listened in anguish as Qwabe spelt out his daughter’s last moments.

Mr Hindocha, who wore Anni’s photograph on his shoulder, appeared to wipe a tear from his eye as the self-confessed killer made an appeal for his forgiveness.

Addressing ‘the family’, Qwabe said: 'I truly and humbly regret and apologise about what happened to their daughter. If ever or whenever they can find it in their hearts to forgive me I am sorry from the bottom of my heart.'

South Africa’s attempts to extradite Shrien Dewani back to Cape Town for trial have stalled while the Briton is treated for post traumatic stress disorder and severe depression.

Mngeni denies kidnapping, robbery, murder and owning an unlicensed gun. His trial, which takes place in front of a judge, but no jury, continues.
