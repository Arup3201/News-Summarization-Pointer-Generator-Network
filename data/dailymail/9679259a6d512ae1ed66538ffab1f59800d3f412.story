Eddie Hearn has revealed he is in talks with the City Ground in Nottingham to make a 2015 fight between Carl Froch and James DeGale.

Hopes of a Las Vegas showdown between Froch and Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr have all but disappeared, with Hearn admitting DeGale is now the ‘strong favourite’ to be Froch’s next opponent.

DeGale, who is set to have a tune-up fight in Sheffield on December 6, is the mandatory challenger for Froch’s IBF super-middleweight world title and Hearn believes it is doubtful that the Nottingham fighter will vacate his belt.

Therefore, it is looking increasingly likely that Froch will follow his stunning Wembley win over George Groves in May with another stadium fight, with February and March dates under consideration.

Hearn, writing in his Mail Online column, said: ‘I met with Carl Froch last week and the first thing I could see is that he is getting itchy knuckles again. This guy wants to fight.

‘There are a lot of discussions going on at the moment and as it stands it looks to me like a fight with Julio Cesar Chavez is not going to happen.

‘James DeGale is now strong favourite to get the fight, probably in February or March of next year. 

'James is obviously Carl’s mandatory challenger for the IBF super-middleweight belt and under those terms Carl has to fight him by the end of February or give up the belt. Carl is not the sort of fighter who just gives up a belt so I think that fight is now very likely.

‘I have had some discussions about possible venues and I am looking at a few outdoor stadia, including the City Ground in Nottingham, Carl’s hometown. He has filled big arenas from Manchester to Wembley to the O2 and this is the kind of fight and venue that excites him. We are working on it.’
