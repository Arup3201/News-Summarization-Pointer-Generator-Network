A temporary order by a Superior Court judge is keeping a man from smoking inside his home in the District of Columbia - even though it's completely legal. 

WJLA-TV reports that Edwin Gray's next door neighbors in northeast Washington have filed a civil suit claiming they're being harmed by smoke that sneaks into their home through a hole in the basement. 

The family moved into the home next to Gray last year and have one child, and another on the way. 

No smoking zone: Edwin Gray has been ordered not to smoke inside his home, which his family has owned for the past 50 years 

Complaints: The temporary injunction was ordered by a Superior Court judge after one of Gray's neighbors in northeast Washington, DC filed a lawsuit saying smoke was leaking into their home

A judge issued a temporary injunction last week saying neither Gray nor any family or guests may smoke in the home the family has owned for 50 years. The family has vowed to fight the order.

In court filings and a statement, the neighbors say they tried to work with Gray and his sister Mozella Johnson, but that the mediation attempts failed and they decided to file the suit. 

'You want me to stop what I've been doing in my house, all my life,' Gray remarked. 

In addition to seeking an injunction on smoking at the house, the neighbors are also asking for $500,000 in damages. 

The lawsuit does set a precedent for other complaints in the DC area. A columnist for the Washington Post said the Gray lawsuit could lead to hundreds of others, from neighbors hoping to control the activities of other residents. 

'We were floored,' Gray's sister, Johnson, said. 'If this judge has done this, who will be next? What other neighbor will be next?'
