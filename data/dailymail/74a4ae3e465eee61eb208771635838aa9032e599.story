Irish President Michael D. Higgins was today given a guided tour of Windsor Castle by the Duke of York, as part of his groundbreaking state visit to the UK.  

He inspected a tribute to the bravery of Irish soldiers which has hung above a grand stairway in the Royal palace for nearly a century.  

Later, the President - who attended a ceremonial banquet hosted by the Queen in Windsor last night - visited 10 Downing Street for a meeting with David Cameron.

Visit: The Irish President is currently on a historic state trip to the UK

Inspection: Mr Higgins looked at the colours of Irish regiments of the British army, disbanded in 1922

Mr Higgins and his wife Sabina, accompanied by Prince Andrew, viewed the colours of the regiments of the British Army that were disbanded when Ireland gained independence in 1922.  

They were placed in the castle by King George V in honour of the sacrifice made by Irish soldiers in the First World War and other conflicts.  

The colours have never been moved from their permanent setting - except when the 1992 Windsor fire threatened to destroy them.  

'Needs must, we took them out,' the Duke of York - who is colonel-in-chief of the Royal Irish Regiment - told the couple.

Before Ireland became independent from the UK, soldiers from the island frequently served in the British Army.  

Six regiments were particularly populated by soldiers from southern Ireland - the Royal Irish Regiment, the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Connaught Rangers, the Prince of Wales' Leinster Regiment (Royal Canadians), the Royal Munster Fusiliers and the South Irish Horse.  

The regiments served alongside other British soldiers in the Boer War and First World War.

In 1922, all but six counties of Ireland seceded from the UK, forming the Irish Free State.

The regiments which drew their men from the area no longer under British control were disbanded that year, but King George V was determined that their sacrifices would not be forgotten.  

Their regimental colours were erected above a staircase at one of the entrances to Windsor Castle, where they have stayed for 92 years. 

They have been held at Windsor since the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, when the six regiments of the British Army from that part of Ireland which had become independent were disbanded.  

In a message to all six regiments, George V said: 'The Colours are to be preserved and held in reverence at Windsor Castle as a perpetual record of your noble exploits in the field.'  

Mr and Mrs Higgins looked over the colours of the Royal Irish Regiment, the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Connaught Rangers, the Prince of Wales' Leinster Regiment (Royal Canadians), and the Royal Munster Fusiliers. The South Irish Horse did not have a colour.  

There were 58,000 Irish soldiers in the British army at the start of the First World War, while 140,000 volunteered for units that were stationed in Ireland during the war.

As well as Windsor Castle and Downing Street, Mr Higgins was scheduled to visit University College Hospital to meet NHS workers from Ireland. 

He was also planning to pay a trip to the Royal Society and London's City Hall.

Unprecedented: The Irish flag flew on a royal limousine outside Number 10 today

Windsor Castle was the setting for a historic state banquet in Mr Higgins's honour yesterday, where the Queen said that Britain and Ireland shall 'no longer allow our past to ensnare our future'. 

Northern Ireland deputy first minister and ex-IRA commander Martin McGuinness stood and joined in a toast to the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and the people of the UK as an orchestra played God Save The Queen. 

In his speech, Mr Higgins made reference to the Queen's historic visit to Ireland, saying: 'Admirably, you chose not to shy away from the shadows of the past, recognising that they cannot be ignored when we consider the relationship between our islands.'  

He said he valued her 'apt and considered words when you addressed some of the painful moments of our mutual history'.
