It's far from stained glass windows but one graffiti artist has turned his considerable talent to the white facades of a church and turned them into modern works of art using all colors of the rainbow.

The artist Hense, with the help of a small crew of spraypaint can-wielding friends, transformed the building in Washington D.C. into a vivid collection of graphic works.

The small group of dedicated artists had transformed the place of worship in a matter of weeks.

Bright future: The church was changed in a matter of weeks by a small group of dedicated artists

Ready for change: Most people's reaction to the church's makeover has been positive the artist said

The team used rollers, brushes, spray paint, inks, acrylics, mops, enamels and sprayers to makeover the tired-looking white building with an explosion of color. They reached the upper portions using a hydraulic lift.

Hense, whose artwork can be found at hensethename.com, has said that the response to his work has been mostly positive.

However he admitted that there had been some criticism that he had defaced a house of God.

The artist's other work can also be seen at mural projects on the side of apartment buildings in Atlanta, Georgia, on huge outdoor facades in Richmond, Virginia and on stores around Lenox, Georgia.
