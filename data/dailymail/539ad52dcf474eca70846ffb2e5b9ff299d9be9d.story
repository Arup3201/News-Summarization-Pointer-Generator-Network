The parents of a Japanese girl who was abducted by the North Koreans at the age of 13 today spoke of their agony over not knowing her fate 36 years on.

For two decades after Megumi Yokota vanished on her way home to school, the police would call her parents whenever they found an unidentified body.

It later emerged that she was one of a dozen Japanese citizens kidnapped by the secretive North Korean regime in order to help teach spies about Japan.

North Korea insists that Megumi is now dead - but her body has never been recovered, and her parents still hold out hope that she may be alive and will return home one day.

The schoolgirl from Niigata disappeared while walking home after playing badminton at school in 1977.

'We felt a huge fear,' her mother Sakie told a UN panel today. 'I took her little brothers by the hand and we ran out in the dark, looking on beaches and calling Megumi, Megumi.'

Police sniffer dogs found that Megumi had reached a street corner near her home, but the trail went cold there.

'Whenever they found a body, or there was a murder, or a skeleton got snagged in the fishing net of a boat, anywhere in Japan, the police would get in touch with us,' Mrs Yokota said.

'We lived in a sadness that I thought would drive us mad.'

In 1997, reports began to emerge suggesting that a number of missing Japanese people had ended up in North Korea.

Five years later, Kim Jong Il admitted that 13 people had been kidnapped from Japan in the 1970s and 1980s in order to help efforts to spy on the country.

The regime claimed that eight of them - including Megumi - were dead, but did not provide proof.

It emerged that Megumi had married and had a child while in North Korea, but her subsequent fate was unclear.

Mystery: The Yokota family is fighting to find out Megumi's fate, and they say they are confident she will return

Pyongyang sent Japan some remains which they claimed were those of Megumi, but DNA tests found that they were in fact a man's.

'Three photos came back with the bones, our first sight of Megumi as an adult,' Mrs Yokota said. 'I cried and cried. Both my husband and I apologised for not being able to help her.'

She told the UN Commission of Inquiry that her daughter would turn 49 in October.

'She was just 13 years old,' she added. 'Did they mistake her for an adult and take her, or did they have something else in mind? We'll never know. Until she comes home.'

The UN hearing in Tokyo is the first time an expert panel has ever formally examined North Korea's human rights record.

The dispute over the abductees has been one of the most controversial obstacles to establishing good relations between Japan and Pyongyang.

Prime minister Shinzo Abe has expressed hope that North Korea's young president Kim Jong Un will be more open to co-operation than his father, but the North has refused to recognise the UN commission.

Panel chair Michael Kirby, a retired Australian judge, said that the inquiry aimed to give a voice to the Yokotas and other affected families, and to help them know what happened to their relatives.

'Who else has engaged in kidnapping, and not kidnapping of nuclear scientists, internet experts - the kidnapping of a chef, a guard, a schoolchild, a housewife whose two young children were left crying in a creche?' he said.

'It certainly calls out for evidentiary answers. If the evidentiary answers are not given, North Korea will only have itself to blame if the commission of inquiry and the world community believes what these witnesses have told.'
