Free: Jon Venables, one of James Bulger's killers, has been secretly released from prison

Jon Venables - one of the child killers of James Bulger - has been secretly freed from prison, it was revealed today.

The 31-year-old, who was released from his life sentence for the brutal murder of the toddler in 2001, was locked up again three years ago after being caught with child porn on his computer.

But it has been claimed today that he was released last week and given a fourth new identity - with the cost of protecting Venables believed to have passed £1million.

The Sun reports that James's family was only informed of Venables' release yesterday.

Mother Denise Fergus, who has campaigned widely since the death of her son, was said to be 'shocked'.

She told the paper: 'I have been told that the terms of his parole mean that he must not enter Merseyside. But the probation service didn't monitor him properly last time so I have no faith in their ability to do that now.

'They should've kept him locked up for a long time.'

James's father Ralph is convinced that Venables will re-offend, a fried of his told The Sun, adding that the family had not been given updates on the plans to release the killer.

'As ever they are kept in the dark,' the friend said. 'They don't explain the terms of his release, I don't know whether they are going to.'

Killers: Venables and classmate Robert Thompson, right,
were ten when they abducted two-year-old James, left, from a shopping centre in 
Bootle, Merseyside

This year marks the 20th anniversary of James’s murder.

Venables
 and classmate Robert Thompson were 10 when they abducted the 
two-year-old from a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside, in February 
1993, and tortured and murdered him.

They were given life sentences for the crime, but released on licence in 2001 with new identities, despite public opposition.

The terms of Venables’s parole banned 
him from entering Merseyside, but it emerged that he had flouted the 
terms by attending soccer matches and nightclubs in Liverpool.

Jon Venables was first released from prison in 2001, at the age of 18, and given a new identity to protect him from the risk of vigilante attacks.

At the time, a psychiatrist ruled that he did not pose a danger to the public and was extremely unlikely to commit any further offences.

However, he developed drinking and drugs problems, and he compromised his identity at least twice by telling friends he was a convicted murderer.

When a probation officer visited his home in Cheshire to discuss his fears that he could be in danger, he was attempting to destroy the hard drive of his computer.

The hard drive was later examined by police, who discovered that it contained dozens of indecent images of children.

Venables admitted that he had posed online as a 35-year-old woman who had abused her eight-year-old daughter, and was returned to prison.

During his latest imprisonment he was given yet another new identity because of the risk posed by a previous security breach.

He
 was also arrested over a drunken brawl and cocaine offences, but the 
then Justice Secretary Jack Straw allowed him to remain at large.

Following his arrest for child porn 
offences, it was revealed that Venables had fallen into a spiral of 
drink and drug addiction because he struggled with the psychological 
pressure of living under an assumed name.

It is said to have taken officials two months to prepare his new identity.

Venables was first given a new identity when he and Thompson were sent to a young offenders' institution for murdering the toddler.

A second new identity was created for him when he was released in 2001, and he was given a third identity after he was sent back to jail in 2010 for possessing child abuse images.

Each change of identity is believed to cost taxpayers around £250,000, with the total bill for Venables therefore reaching £1million with his latest release.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'We do not comment on individual offenders.

'The re-release of life licensed offenders is directed by the independent Parole Board once they are satisfied they can be safely managed in the community.'
