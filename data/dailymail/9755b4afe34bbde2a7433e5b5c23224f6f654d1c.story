In the cut-throat world of Hollywood fitness gurus, he has long been the hottest property.

Wearing nothing but the skimpiest of swimming trunks and a microphone, Bikram Choudhury won a legion of celebrity acolytes with his brand of ‘hot yoga’, which sees devotees exercise in temperatures up to 40C (104F).

Now, according to allegations by one of Choudhury’s young protegees, it seems all that heat might have gone to his head.

Lawsuit: Sarah Baughn is suing Bikram Choudhury, whose yoga regime has become a global phenomenon

Sarah Baughn has accused him of sexually assaulting and harassing her, then sabotaging her career when she rebuffed him.

In a lawsuit filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court, Miss Baughn, 29, says Choudhury, whose devotees include Madonna and Pippa Middleton, pressed his body against hers and whispered sexual comments.

The 67-year-old also supposedly told her that his wife Rajashree was a ‘bitch’ and that she had to save him from her.

Claims: The founder of Bikram yoga, Bikram Choudhury, has been accused of sexual harassment and discrimination by one of his students

The sex harassment and discrimination 
lawsuit states that Miss Baughn was a college student when she first 
started taking Bikram Yoga classes.

In 2005 he supposedly propositioned 
Miss Baughn for the first time at a teacher training course at a Bikram 
centre in Los Angeles, saying: ‘I know you from a past life. We have a 
connection. It is amazing. Should we make this a relationship?’

She claims she was ‘mortified’ and 
told her boyfriend. But ‘non-stop harassment’ ensued, according to the 
lawsuit, which also says that Choudhury would ask her to kiss him in 
front of other people.

At one point Choudhury allegedly told 
her: ‘My wife is such a bitch, you have no idea. She is terrible to me. 
She is so mean. You have to save me.’

The most serious allegation is 
that he pushed Miss Baughn ‘down toward the floor after pulling her arm 
and leg apart’, then ‘pressed his body into hers and began whispering 
sexual things until she collapsed into sobs’.

The lawsuit also states that 
Choudhury’s behaviour was ‘vindictive’ and that he treated Miss Baughn 
like a ‘pariah’ because she would not submit to his demands.

Choudhury began practising yoga in Calcutta at the age of four.

Allegations: Sarah Baughn, 29, claims Bikram Choudhury, 67, relentlessly pursued her for years, sexually assaulted her and sabotaged her yoga career after she resisted his advances

He allegedly came onto Ms Baughn by claiming they had known each other in a past life

She also claims that after she spurned his advances he fixed a yoga competition so she came in second instead of winning

Choudhury, seen here teaching in 2003, also allegedly complained that his wife was a 'bitch'

He went to the US in 1973 at the 
invitation of President Nixon, who was suffering from phlebitis or 
inflammation of veins in the leg.

With the encouragement of other 
celebrity supporters, such as actress Shirley MacLaine, his fitness 
regime   became a global phenomenon, with 720 yoga schools in 220 
countries, including dozens in the UK.

Over the years his celebrity 
devotees have included Michael Jackson and George Clooney. Andy Murray 
put his ascent to number three in the world tennis rankings down to 
Bikram Yoga and David Beckham supposedly tried it.

Choudhury is now a multi-millionaire, living in the Hollywood Hills with a fleet of 40 Rolls-Royces.

He is known for being outspoken in his self-belief and has in the past likened himself to Superman or Buddha.

He once told a business magazine the 
key to his success was ‘because I have b**** like atom bombs... Nobody 
***** with me’ and He reportedly asks his most devoted followers to 
‘brush his hair and massage his body’.

The lawsuit outlines two other incidents where Choudhury is said to have tried to engage Miss Baughn in sex.

At a Thanksgiving dinner at his house 
in 2007, after his wife had gone to bed, Miss Baughn was shocked to see 
him ‘placing a hand on her leg, lying down and whispering sexual demands
in her ear. He then embraced her from behind and pressed his penis into
her leg’.

In 2008 Choudhury again tried to 
molest her, the lawsuit claims, when they were alone in his office and 
he ‘pinned her against the door and sexually assaulted her by kissing 
her neck, chest and face, and grinding his penis against her leg’. She 
claims she tried to fight him off.

Last night, despite several requests for a response, Choudhury was unavailable for comment.
