The body of April Jones may never be found despite the largest police search in British history.

Hundreds of officers and scores of volunteers have scoured the countryside surrounding Machynlleth, mid Wales, since her disappearance to no avail.

Child killer Mark Bridger has not even allowed April's parents the dignity of burying their daughter by steadfastly refusing to come clean about exactly what he did with her body.

During his trial, the former abattoir worker said he accidentally 'crushed' the five-year-old with his Land Rover but claimed he can't remember what happened afterwards 
because he was drunk and panicking.

And yet after he was convicted today, it was revealed for the first time that Bridger confessed to a prison priest that he dumped the body into a river.

The evidence of Father Barry O'Sullivan, who was holding a counselling session with Bridger, was 
not told to the jury but can now be revealed after Bridger was convicted
of abduction, murder and perverting the course of justice at Mold Crown Court.

For seven months, specialist forces from across the UK have 
covered the 'extremely challenging' terrain of the Welsh countryside 
surrounding her home town, scouring mountains, gorges, streams and 
waterfalls.

They battled through awful weather during what proved to be a treacherous winter.

An extensive range of resources were 
used, including police marine units, experts in searching mines and 
confined spaces, fire and rescue and urban search and rescue teams, the 
coastguard, mountain rescue and dog teams from across the country.

More
than 23 square miles and 300 separate locations have been covered in 
total. While the search is now officially finished, officers are on hand
to respond to any new information.

Bridger has never revealed what he did with April but many believe he threw her into fast flowing water near his home.

The father-of-six was being held at HM Prison Manchester - formerly known as Strangeways - when he made the shocking admission to the prison priest.

He had been on suicide watch ahead of his trial and started having regular meetings with priest Barry O'Sullivan.

Judge John Griffith Williams told the court: 'It is his evidence that Mark Bridger said to him on one of their meetings he had disposed of April in the river.'

The court heard how Bridger was spotted the day after April disappeared near the banks of the River Dyfi carrying a black bin bag 'with something in it'.  

Hunt: The search for missing April Jones included many people from the town of Machynlleth and the surrounding area in Powys, Mid Wales, who were desperate to find her

Thorough: Officers searched 32sq km of Welsh countryside, including rivers, forests and fields but have never found her 

Mother-of-three Carwen Sheen was one of the hundreds of people out searching for little April when she saw Bridger holding the black bag, the jury heard.

She told the court: 'I knew Mark Bridger and saw him that morning.

'We were searching the side roads along a narrow back road between Ceinws and Machynlleth.

'I was driving with two friends when I saw Bridger's vehicle pulled up on the side of an overgrown hill.

'The engine was left on and the driver's side door was open.

'I slowed down to pass his car and saw him coming down the bank holding a black bin bag. I would say there was something in the bag not very big, but something in it.

Following April's disappearance the waters near her home were searched by police divers and specialist canoeist.

April disappeared on October 1 last year and despite the biggest search in British criminal history her body has never been found

But she was not found in the rivers which were swollen and fast following from recent rain fall.

Bridger told a murder trial jury he was a Christian who had 'church friends' who tried to help him through his alcoholism.

After his arrest on suspicion of murder he took advantage of the Prison chaplaincy service offered by the Diocese of Salford.

The hunt for the schoolgirl was the UK's biggest ever operation of 
its kind but failed to find her.

Search teams, which included distraught locals, covered thousands of acres of rugged land, forests 
and deep river water in a desperate attempt to find April since she went
missing on October 1 from outside her home in Machynlleth, mid Wales.

But after searches of all key areas were completed, April's 
parents were given the heartbreaking news that they may never get to say
goodbye to their daughter.

The effort to return April to her family, code named Operation Tempest, lasted almost eight months and involved 17 police teams scouring 32sq km of Welsh countryside.

The terrain of winding rivers, mountainous valleys and deep mine shafts and caves, made it a 'unique challenge', the officer who led Tempest said.

Around 16,000 officer search days were dedicated to finding April, involving police from 47 forces across the UK, and volunteers from around the world. He said it was the largest deployment of UK officers since the Lockerbie disaster.

Inspector Gareth Thomas, the search coordinator for Dyfed-Powys Police, said: 'The driving force for us has always been to find April and reunite her with her family.

'That was the priority right from the start and that's what was motivating all those officers who came to help from all over the country and further afield.'

He said due to the fact that Bridger painted himself as an 'Andy McNab or Bear Grylls wannabe' that meant he could have had intimate knowledge of area, making every cave, stream, mineshaft, ditch and quarry a search area.

Mr Thomas said it was with 'immense disappointment' that the search was concluded last month.

'During the course of the search I honestly believed that we would find April, it's an immense disappointment that we have been unable to return April to her family,' he added.

'We can't think of any worst case scenario.'

The search began on the night of October 1 last year with a handful of concerned neighbours on the Bryn-y-Gog estate, soon joined by hundreds of members of the public who came from far and wide as word spread on social and news media.

The realisation, following Mark Bridger's arrest, that April would not be found alive was shattering news for all involved.

Detective superintendent Andy John, the senior investigating officer, said: 'There was a feeling of extreme disappointment because everybody approached the investigation from the outset in the hope that we were going to find April safe and well.'

Describing the reaction of April's parents, Paul and Coral, he added: 'Obviously, on receiving that terrible, terrible news they were extremely traumatised.

'They needed a huge amount of support.

'The vast majority of people could never begin to imagine what they have had to go through and continue to go through because, as we all know they still haven't had their daughter or their daughter's remains returned to them.'

Mr John said police have not given up hope that one day April's remains will be recovered.

'My message to Mark Bridger is quite clear, he needs to tell Paul and Coral Jones, and the family of April what he has done with their daughter,' he said.

Mr Thomas added: 'As soon as we have any more intelligence or information we will recommence the search.'

Like any other little girl April Jones loved to play out with her friends.

And on the night she was snatched by child killer Mark Bridger, April had thrown a 'tantrum' so she could do just that.

Her father, Paul Jones, had told her she could not go out to play.

But April Jones cried and kept asking to be allowed outside – so eventually Paul and his wife Coral gave in.

Less than 20 minutes later she was gone, never to be seen again.

Coral Jones said she and her husband had both told April it was too late to go outside on her little pink bike.In her statement to police, Mrs Jones said: 'She kept on and on and had a little bit of a tantrum.'

'We eventually gave in. I zipped up her coat and she went off to play outside with her friend. I told her I didn't want her to be long. I think that was around 7pm. This was the last time I saw her.'

Mrs Jones said that at about 7.20pm it was getting dark and colder, and she wanted April to come back inside.

He father said she was pleading to be allowed out to play with her best friend after watching the film but they told her it was too late.

'She had a little paddy,' he said.

'I suppose we just gave in and she was told she could only go out for a short while,' he added.

The couple said April knew about 'stranger danger' and would never have got into a car with someone she did not know.

Mr Jones said he had known Bridger since about 1992 when the defendant was dating the sister of his then girlfriend.

He said: 'I can't think of any reason why Mark Bridger would take April, he is a father too. I don't understand why he would do this to her.'

Despite the family's anguish, Bridger has continued to refuse to ease their suffering by telling them what he did with their daughter's body.
