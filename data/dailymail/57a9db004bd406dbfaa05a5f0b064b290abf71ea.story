A bride-to-be lost an incredible eight stone after becoming cripplingly embarrassed by her weight.

Tessa Thurgood, 29 from Plymouth, was engaged to be married with the date set but decided she needed to make a change before the big day when she 'didn't recognise herself' in the mirror.

'I was the queen of convenience and processed foods opting for quick, unhealthy
and fattening foods rather than anything fresh,' she said.

Tessa now feels like a new woman: over 100lbs lighter and enjoying married life

'I would also avoid 
breakfast and tend to have a large mid morning snack such as a packet of
crisps and a chocolate bar. Now I try to eat a varied diet full of 
fresh fruit, vegetables and lots of lean protein.'

Now over 100lbs lighter and finally enjoying life, Tessa feels 'like a new woman'.

And she says that she didn't always struggle with her weight: 'I wasn't always big and was very 
active during my school years. The weight started going on when I left 
home and moved into a shared house and was cooking for myself, also 
takeaways were always an easy option.

'I was always quite a confident 
person, so when that disappeared I realised I just wasn't the person 
that I wanted to be and I wasn't happy within myself and I needed to change that.'

While Tessa had always enjoyed exercise she felt that joining women's only gym Curves would give her the structure she needed to lose weight once and for all.

'I had turned into someone I didn't 
recognise, I was never someone that didn't want to go out so this wasn't
me. My mum told me about Curves so I plucked up the courage and joined.
I wanted to do it on my own.'

Wedded bliss: 'My husband and I have talked about having children and hope this is something that will happen'

Tessa got down to a size 16 for her wedding and has since slimmed further to a svelte size 12.

'I have been married for two years 
now. My husband and I have talked about having children and hope this is
something that will happen in the future.'

Tessa, who works as an engineering Service Controller, is enjoying celebrating her weight loss success by going shopping and 
spending time with family and friends; something she shied away from 
when she was larger.

'When I decided to lose weight I 
didn't want to follow any particular diets, I wanted to educate myself 
and make the right food choices on my own. 

'I wanted it to be a lifestyle change
once and for all. But if I want a treat I do allow myself one, I am just
more careful with what I have and obviously do not have treats as big a treat 
as I used to.'

'Everyone at the gym is 
really friendly and welcoming and the 30-minute circuit workout really 
suits me and my busy lifestyle. I can’t believe what I’ve achieved but I
know I couldn’t have done it with the support of my family, friends and
Curves.' she said.

Her new
husband is also very impressed. 'He can't believe what I have achieved,
sometimes we are in town and he looks for me and forgets I have lost 
all the weight. 

'It never really bothered him about my weight but obviously loves the new me.'

2012 and we are really thrilled for her.

'Her story really embodies what the
