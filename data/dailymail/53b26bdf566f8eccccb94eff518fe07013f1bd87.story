Don’t worry, Manchester City fans. There could be a saviour on the way. After watching their side lose to Stoke for the first time in the Premier League, the City faithful will have been feeling a bit down.

Now, they could see one of the world’s best strikers in their line-up when they take on Arsenal after the international break.

The Premier League champions have a long-standing interest in Falcao, whose move is more likely with Alvaro Negredo keen to sign for Valencia on loan.

Transfer: Radamel Falcao could be on his way to the Premier League with Manchester City

Falcao normally carries a £50million price tag but he is also available on loan for the season at a cost of £12m.

City’s director of football Txiki Begiristain is understood to have held talks with Monaco officials at last Thursday’s Champions League draw in the principality.

Real Madrid were favourites to sign Falcao, 28, who appeared to confirm his move to the Bernabeu in a message posted on his official Twitter account that was hastily deleted on Saturday. However, Madrid instead opted for Javier Hernandez from Manchester United. Falcao’s agent Jorge Mendes is believed to have spent last week pushing Falcao towards the Etihad in the hope of executing both deals.

The situation has been further complicated by the fact that Negredo is sidelined with a broken foot. The Spaniard has had a protective boot removed and no longer requires crutches, but he was seen limping after Saturday’s home defeat by Stoke and is out of action for at least another month.

Available: Monaco have offered the Colombian forward on a permanent or loan deal

City would have had to sell Negredo and possibly two more if they wanted to sign Falcao on a permanent deal and still meet the £49m net spend limit set by UEFA’s financial fair play rules but the loan agreement wouldn’t be a problem.

The City boss said: ‘We will see what happens. We have a restriction about the amount of money we can spend and the number of players we can use, so it’s not easy.’

Pellegrini was speaking after seeing City fail to score at home in the league for only the second time in 71 games. With Sergio Aguero making his first start of the season and Edin Dzeko, Stevan Jovetic, David Silva and Samir Nasri at Pellegrini’s disposal, City looked flat following last week’s win over Liverpool.

World Cup: Falcao missed out on playing at the World Cup after suffering a serious knee einjury

The defeat by Stoke could not have come at a worse time for Pellegrini as he prepares to lose his players to international duty once again before a week of critical fixtures. City face title rivals Arsenal and Chelsea on consecutive weekends either side of a visit to Bayern Munich in their opening Champions League tie.

City were undone by a wonderful solo goal from Mame Biram Diouf. The former Manchester United striker raced 70 yards after Stoke cleared a City corner in the 58th minute and scored through the legs of England goalkeeper Joe Hart.

‘It was a goal we cannot concede,’ added Pellegrini. ‘It came from our corner.’

City may also sell players today with Matija Nastasic, Micah Richards, Scott Sinclair and John Guidetti available.

SUPER STAT: Stoke ended a run of 12 Premier League defeats in Manchester, having lost away to City and United on every occasion since winning promotion in 2008.
