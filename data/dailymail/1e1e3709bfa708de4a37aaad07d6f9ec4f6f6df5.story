Grieving families of war veterans recently killed in action are hitting out at the U.S. government for not paying death benefits to which they are entitled.

The shutdown has halted many government services, including military death benefits totaling $100,000, a one year housing allowance, up to $9,000 for a funeral and a flight to Dover Air Force Base, in Delaware, for a dignified reception of their loved ones’ remains.

The outcry has led Congress to act quickly, a bill is expected to be passed Wednesday morning to remedy the problem, according to Speaker of the House John Boehner.

Heroes: Special Agent Joseph M. Peters and 1st Lt. Jennifer M. Moreno were both killed this weekend by an improvised explosive device

‘The government is hurting the wrong people,’ Shannon Collins, who lost her son, Marine Lance Corporal Jeremiah M. Collins Jr., over the weekend in Afghanistan told NBC News.

‘Families shouldn’t have to worry about how they’re going to bury their child,’ she added. ‘Families shouldn’t have to worry about how they're going to feed their family if they don’t go to work this week,’

Of the seventeen service members who have died since the shutdown began, not a single one of their families has received the payments sent within three days of their deaths.

Sergeant Patrick Hawkins, 25, Private First Class Cody Patterson, 24, Lieutenant. Jennifer Moreno, 25, and Special Agent Joseph Peters, 24 all died from an explosive device this past weekend. Marine Lance Corporal Jeremiah Collins Jr, 19, also died, but his death is under investigation.

‘They killed my boy,’ Randall Patterson, the father of PFC Patterson, told NBC News.

The devastated father said all he wanted on the flight from his home in Oregon to Dover was a scotch on the rocks.

‘It better be on that tray,’ he told the Army. ‘I don’t care if you have to pay for it out of your own pocket.’

The wife of Special Agent Peters is also upset.

Explaining to NBC News that she’s a stay-at-home mother, Ashley Peters lamented that her late husband said his family would always be taken care of if the worst should happen.

‘It is upsetting because my husband died for his country, and now his family is left to worry,’ she told the news outlet.

Politicians first took the opportunity to point out that the Pay Our Military Act signed into law last week authorized the Department of Defense to pay all expenses, including pay checks and death benefits, but the military disagreed.

A Pentagon official told the New York Daily News that the law failed to allow ‘any payments to family members of service members, and therefore cannot be used to legally justify the payment of survivor benefits.’

‘If the department was allowed to make death gratuity payments at any point during shutdown, they would’ve been paid, with great relief,’ the official added.

This isn't right: Shannon Collins, mother Mr Collins, says that families deserve the benefit because of the sacrifice made by their loved ones

Sgt Hawkins was on his fourth deployment to Afghanistan, he died rushing to the aid of another dying soldier.

‘’ Sgt. Patrick Hawkins was a brave and incredibly talented Ranger,’ Lt. Col., Patrick J. Ellis, the commander of the 3rd battalion, told NBC News. ‘His actions that night were in keeping with the epitome of the Ranger Creed: ‘I will never leave a fallen comrade.’

First Lt. Moreno was a nurse assigned to the cultural support team, it was her first combat deployment.

This will be fixed: Speak Boehner promised the problem would be fixed Wednesday morning

‘Our unit mourns the loss of 1st Lt. Jennifer Moreno,’ Lt Col. Ellis told NBC News.

Lance Cpl Collins was out of high school for just over a year when he died in what NBC News termed ‘murky circumstances.’

Denied what they rightfully deserve, the families of these heroes should soon receive their benefits, according to Speaker Boehner.

‘Tomorrow, the House is going to act specifically on this and I hope the president will sign it,’ he said during a Tuesday press conference.
