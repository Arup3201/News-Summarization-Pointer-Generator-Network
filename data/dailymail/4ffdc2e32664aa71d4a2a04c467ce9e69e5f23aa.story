Paul Nicholls believes Irish raider Champagne Fever is the horse which stands between him and a remarkable ninth King George VI Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day.

The champion trainer will saddle three of the 10 entries in the £200,000 steeplechase with sponsors William Hill making his 2013 winner Silviniaco Conti 5-2 favourite to land a second victory in a race with a history of multiple winners.

Last week, Champagne Fever’s trainer Willie Mullins said he was heading to Kempton with concerns that the Ruby Walsh-ridden horse lacked the necessary experience to land a first victory over three miles since his nursery days in the point-to-point field.

Trainer Paul Nicholls fears that Champagne Fever is the only thing that stands between him and another win

But, after watching the grey’s victory in the two-and-a-half-mile Clonmel Oil Chase last month, Nicholls, who also saddles 6-1 shot Al Ferof and 50-1 outsider Wonderful Charm, senses where the danger lies.

He said: ‘Silviniaco Conti is last year’s winner so deserves to be favourite but when I saw Champagne Fever win I thought that is the one to beat in the King George. I have always had the feeling Ruby thought that as well. He just looked impressive.’

Nicholls also believes Sam Twiston-Davies-ridden Al Ferof, beaten just under 15 lengths when third last year and another seeking a first win over three miles, is likely to be much closer to Silviniaco Conti on Friday.

The trainer, who has also won the race five times with Kauto Star and twice with See More Business, added: ‘Al Ferof probably produced a career best to win the Amlin Chase at Ascot last month and the form has worked out well.

‘He obviously has to prove he can win over three miles but he is a year older and there is stamina in his pedigree.’

Both geldings have benefited from treatment for gastric ulcers which Nicholls believes affected their performances last season.

‘When Conti was fourth in the Gold Cup, he wandered under pressure as if something was hurting and even when he won at Aintree he pulled himself up from the last fence,’ said Nicholls. ‘We thought we were missing something, gastro-scoped him and he had grade four ulcers.

‘Whether it is a footballer, athlete or racehorse you are always trying to eliminate problems.’

Five of the King George line-up were in last year’s race with Cue Card second, Dynaste, who finished lame, fifth and Menorah pulled up. Two fences out, Cue Card still looked the winner but he was ultimately outstayed by Silviniaco Conti as his stamina kicked in.

Jockey Noel Fehily will no doubt attempt to make that happen again on an eight-year-old whose ability to stay — so important because the tempo of the race is invariably demanding — was also crucial as he landed a second Betfair Chase at Haydock last month.

It should prove the difference again.

Having twice been beaten in the race it is hard to see why Cue Card should make it third time lucky but Dynaste, a creditable third in the Betfair Chase, has frame claims for trainer David Pipe and jockey Tom Scudamore.

The Menorah of 12 months ago would have no chance but he has proved a different proposition this season. A win in last month’s Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby was followed by a two-length second to Silviniaco Conti in the Betfair Chase.

The drying ground conditions is a positive, as they are for his Peterborough Chase-winning stable-mate Wishfull Thinking, plus Menorah has won on all his three runs at Kempton.

He should give Tom O’Brien, standing in for suspended Richard Johnson, an exciting ride.

With Jamie Moore having failed to recover from the shoulder muscle injury he sustained in a fall at Cheltenham on December 13, trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies has called up stable conditional jockey Ryan Hatch to ride Double Ross.

But, admirable though the eight-year-old is, he has looked a few pounds short of this level and the same applies to Nicholls’s third string, Wonderful Charm.

Johns Spirit steps up in grade after some great runs in handicaps but with his trainer Jonjo O’Neill struggling badly with his form for most of the last two months, it is hard to see him figuring in the finish.
