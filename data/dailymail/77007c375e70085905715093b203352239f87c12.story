A paedophile has had his conviction for having sex with an 11-year-old overturned after an Italian judge ruled it was ‘a romantic relationship.'

The supreme court in the southern Italian town of Catanzaro ruled the 60-year-old was in a ‘real relationship’, with the girl according to local media reports.

The girl is understood to be from a disadvantaged background and had 
been placed into the care of the man – who worked for the local social 
services department, according to the Italian news 
website TGCom24.

The pair were found naked in bed together when police raided the man’s seaside villa.

The man was given a five-year sentence for sexual violence against a minor, reports the BBC.

The age of consent is 14 and rises to 16 when one of the partners is in position of authority or care over the younger participant.

But the child sex victim reportedly claimed to be in love with her carer.

The case is being sent back to the Catanzaro court for a retrial and there are expected to be several levels of appeal before a sentence is confirmed.
