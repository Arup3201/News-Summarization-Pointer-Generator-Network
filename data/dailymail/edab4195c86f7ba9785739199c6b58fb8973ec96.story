He bobbled the 
spelling, but President Barack Obama had nothing but R-E-S-P-E-C-T for 
the 'women of soul' who shook and rattled the rafters of the White House
 on Thursday night.

'What a lineup!' Obama 
declared at the outset of a concert that featured a generations-spanning
 array of soul singers that stretched from musical legends Aretha 
Franklin and Patti LaBelle to 20-year-old Ariana Grande.

Obama
 paid tribute to Franklin for turning her signature song Respect into 'a rallying cry for African-Americans, women and then everyone who felt 
marginalized.'

The pumped-up audience gave a hearty laugh but was more than willing to forgive the president for spelling it 'R-S-P-E-C-T.'

First
 up in the East Room lineup was LaBelle, with a thundering delivery of Over the Rainbow that had the audience on its feet.

It
 was a mutual admiration society of sorts as LaBelle thanked the Obamas 
for their tenure in the White House, declaring, 'Baby, you got swag!'

Grande,
 the youngster in the group, seemed in awe of her fellow performers and 
the august audience. Her lead-in: 'What's up? How are you? Good to see 
you. Thank you for having me.'

The emotional 
high point came when Franklin, 71, sauntered in, gave a shimmy and 
declared 'Let's have a party.' Then she went right into I Never Loved a
 Man (The Way I Love You). She was back later to close down the show 
with what Obama called 'one more treat,' - a slow, soulful rendition of 'Amazing Grace' that turned rowdy at the end.

But
 first, all the other ladies - including Melissa Etheridge, Janelle 
Monae, Jill Scott and Tessanne Chin - collaborated on a rollicking 
delivery of Proud Mary.

The concert was 
livestreamed at WhiteHouse.gov/live and will be broadcast as In 
Performance at the White House: Women of Soul on April 7 on PBS.

At
 a morning arts workshop for high school and college students, first 
lady Michelle Obama called soul the kind of music that makes you move, 
no matter who you are or where you come from.'

LaBelle,
 Etheridge and Monae had plenty of stories and advice to share with the 
students, then got them whooping, hooting and swaying with a trio of 
songs in the intimate venue of the State Dining Room.

Mrs. Obama quoted LaBelle as once saying that she had succeeded because she 'took chances and sang my butt off.'

The first lady tried her own riff on that advice - then admitted she may have taken it a little too far.

'Find
 your own voice and be proud of it,' she said. 'And then, sing your butt
 off.  Or work your butt off.  Or whatever you do, do it until your butt
 comes off. '

Then she added: 'OK, that quote 
is going to be kind of funny in the papers.  I already know it.  My 
communications people are like, "What?"  But you guys all know what I 
meant - be good at what you do.'

The concert was scheduled as part of Women's History Month.

Said
 the president: 'As someone who always shares this house with brilliant,
 creative, talented, somewhat stubborn women, I think Women's History 
Month is the perfect time to honor a few more: the women of soul.'
