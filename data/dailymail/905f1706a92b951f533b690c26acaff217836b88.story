House prices in London are nearly 25 per cent higher than their pre-recession peak and more than double the average for the rest of the country, official figures showed yesterday.

The Office for National Statistics said a typical home in the capital is worth £459,000 – 24.8 per cent more than in January 2008.

But prices across the rest of the UK are still 2.4 per cent lower than they were before the crisis, at £195,000, despite a rise of 5.1 per cent in the past 12 months.

British capital: House prices in London are nearly 25 per cent higher than their pre-recession peak and more than double the average for the rest of the country, the Office for National Statistics revealed yesterday

Only London, the South East as a whole, and the East have seen house prices fully recover from the downturn, the report said.

Prices across much of the North are still around 8 per cent lower than they were before the recession.

Experts said the figures highlighted the divide between London and much of the rest of the UK, with a ‘two-speed’ housing market developing.

Expert: Richard Sharp, of the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee, said the country was 'alert to risks represented by the acceleration of asset prices, particularly property'

Paul Smith, of estate agent Haart, said: ‘London is most definitely a country of its own when it comes to property prices.’ 

He warned that much of the rest of the UK was ‘still getting over the battering it took back in 2008’. 

The report fuelled fears that a dangerous property price bubble is blowing up in parts of the UK at a time when vast swathes of the country are struggling to recover.

Richard Sharp, of the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee, said: ‘In the UK now, we are alert to risks represented by the acceleration of asset prices, particularly property, in part arising from the low interest rate environment.’

The ONS warned rising prices could mean ‘rising levels of indebtedness’ as buyers are forced to take on bigger mortgages, leaving them ‘vulnerable’ to higher interest rates.

It said this could make the economy less able to ‘withstand further shocks’.

The average house price for the whole of the UK fell 15 per cent during the financial crisis but is now 3.2 per cent above the January 2008 peak at £252,000.

The value of a typical home in the South East is 3.4 per cent higher than it was in early 2008 at £309,000 while in the East prices are up 3.1 per cent to £265,000.

But the average price in the North West is still 8 per cent lower than before the crisis, at £165,000, and in the North East house prices are down 7.9 per cent at £148,000. 

Jeremy Duncombe, of financial services firm Legal & General, said: ‘These figures highlight the two-speed housing market.’

The Mortgage Advice Bureau’s Brian Murphy said: ‘The Bank of England cannot ignore the fact that house prices in London and the surrounding areas are skewing the broader picture.’
