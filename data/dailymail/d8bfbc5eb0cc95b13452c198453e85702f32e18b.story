They may have fallen by the wayside lately, in favour of tablets and phones, but experts predict sales of desktop PCs will rise again this year.

And a Polish startup is hoping to aid this resurgence by developing a computer within a mouse.

The mouse concept is fitted with a quad-core processor, Wi-Fi and 128GB storage - the only extra hardware needed is a monitor.

The Mouse Box concept was created by Poland-based Przemysław Strzelczyk and a team of software developers. It is the same size as a traditional mouse, meaning it would fit comfortably in the hand, and runs on a 1.4GHz ARM processor, like the chip inside the Samsung Galaxy Note 10, for example

Called Mouse-Box, the wireless gadget was designed by Poland-based Przemysław Strzelczyk and a team of software developers.

It is the same size as a traditional mouse, meaning it would comfortably in the hand, and runs on a 1.4GHz ARM processor, like the chip inside the Samsung Galaxy Note 10, for example.

It connects to a monitor or projector via a standard HDMI cable, and comes with the same amount of storage as a high-end iPhone 6 Plus.

The SONICable claims to halve the amount of time it takes to charge a battery. 

It is available for iPhone and Android devices. 

When it’s plugged into a device, but switched off, it acts like a standard USB cable and syncs content from one device to another.

But, when it is switched on, the syncing functions are disabled so the cable concentrates all of its energy into charging the connected device.

The £18 SONICable is set to ship in March.

This can’t be physically expanded, but can be increased using cloud storage.

Mouse-Box comes with built-in Wi-Fi connectivity, and charges wirelessly on an inductive charging pad that doubles up as a mouse pad.

This means it should never run out of battery.

‘At the beginning, moving computers was a real challenge’ explained the Polish startup.

‘Computer portability has been improving along with developing a PC.

‘However, it still isn’t ideal as it is necessary to transport a lot of its parts - a monitor, a keyboard, a CPU and a mouse.

'We are introducing Mouse-Box, a computer different than ever before - an incredible combination of the two most important elements in a computer set.’

In a video, the Mouse-Box is shown being used to make presentations, as an alternative to the work PC, or to replace a PC at home.

The startup is currently looking for funding to create a prototype, and later put the device into mass production, so a release date and price have not been announced.

Global shipments of PCs rose by one per cent in the last quarter of 2014, and analysts from Gartner believe they will continue to rise in 2015.

They predict that this year, shipments will climb to almost 317 million units, up  2.9 per cent from 2014 - almost matching the number of units shipped in 2013.

They also predict that tablet sales will decline as a result.
