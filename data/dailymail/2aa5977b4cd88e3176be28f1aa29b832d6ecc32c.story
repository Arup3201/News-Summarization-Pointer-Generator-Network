The luxurious Beverly Hills Hotel, a favored haunt for Hollywood A-listers, is being deserted as celebrities join a boycott of it over the anti-gay laws of the hotel's owner.

In the past week, at least 20 events have been canceled at the historic hotel, and stars including Jay Leno have taken part in protests outside the pink stucco building.

The boycott is in response to the Sultan of Brunei's decision to impose sharia, which would make it legal for homosexuals who live in his kingdom to be stoned.

Taking a stand: Leno had been due to chair a women's event at the luxury hotel but canceled when its owner imposed sharia in Brunei

The Sultan heads the Dorchester Collection, which runs a chain of opulent hotels around the world.

His decision to impose sharia - Islamic law - on the tiny Asian state he governs has prompted a high-level backlash in the West.

From talk show host Ellen to billionaire Richard Branson, high-profile names have been joining the call to boycott hotels owned by the Sultan.

Ellen went public with her decision to boycott the hotel on April 22, sending a tweet that read: 'I won't be visiting the Hotel Bel-Air or the Beverly Hills Hotel until this is resolved.'

Her tweet, which included a second Dorchester Collection hotel, came on the day the Sultan announced that anyone in Brunei found guilty of homosexuality, adultery or blasphemy would be stoned to death.

As stars brought attention to the harsh penalties, the Beverly Hills began to lose business, with high-profile events canceled in a move that the Wall Street Journal estimates has cost the hotel $2 million.

Talk show host Jay Leno had been due to chair an event at the hotel for the Global Women's Rights awards, but instead joined a protest line outside. 

'What year is it, 1814? Come on people, it's 2014,' he said. 'You know evil flourishes when good people do nothing.'

His sentiment was echoed by British entrepreneur Branson, who said that none of his family members or Virgin employees would stay at a Dorchester hotel 'until the Sultan abides by basic human rights'.

On Thursday a couple of writers from The Hollywood Reporter booked a lunch at the hotel, which is famous for being the place where A-listers such as Tom Cruise meet to do movie business.

The usually bustling Polo Lounge was distinctly empty and, when pressed by the slow lunch trade, a waiter confessed: 'Yes, it’s been quiet these past few days.'

While star sightings would usually be high at the famed hotel, the writers spotted only one - Slumdog Millionaire's Dev Patel.

But, when they asked his agent about the actor's presence, they were told the London-based star had been in Beverly Hills on business, knew nothing of the boycott and 'has no intention of going back there'.

Events including a Night Before the Oscars fundraiser and Women in Entertainment breakfast have been moved from the hotel.

The head of a teen support group, which was due to host a partt for 500 this week, also switched locations because of the boycott.

'When we heard what was going on in Brunei, we said that doesn't fit with our philosophy, Elaine Leader, from the group, said.

Campaign: Beverly Hills mayor Lili Bosse speaks at a city council meeting about plans to pressure the Sultan to give up the hotel

The city mayor, Lili Bosse, has also said that she would steer clear of the hotel, adding: 'The city and the hotel have grown up together ... [but the Brunei laws are] a horrific violation of basic human rights.'

At a meeting earlier this week, the Beverly Hills City council approved a resolution that condemned the Sultan's rule sand urged him to sell the hotel.

Chief executive for the Dorchester group, Christopher Cowdray, flew to Los Angeles from London this week to try to restore confidence in the brand.

He highlighted how the group was a big employer in the region and 'abides by the laws of the countries in which we operate'.

He said it was unlikely that the Sultan-owned group would sell off its investments in the area.
