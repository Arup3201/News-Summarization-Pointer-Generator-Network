Saturday Night Live has been accused by veteran LA comic Ian Gary of ripping off a Tina Turner sketch that aired on Saturday night that featured guest host Sarah Silverman.

The funnyman, who is a tutor at Los Angeles' legendary Groundling comedy troupe, said that the skit which lampooned Tina Turner impersonators on a river cruise was originally performed by his students, Vanessa Ragland and Kimberly Condict over the summer.

In both sketches, impersonators of the superstar wear sequined red mini-dresses and wigs in the style of Turner's iconic 80s hairstyle and sing along to 'Proud Mary' while taking it in turns to make jokes about their prior, failed lives.

However, while both sketches have striking, almost identical similarities, the SNL skit featuring Silverman, Cecily Strong and Sasheer Zamata is shorter, has different punch lines and is tighter paced according to the LA Times.

After SNL's Turner sketch aired on Saturday, Gary, who is a teacher at the Groundling troupe claimed enough was enough and took to Facebook to vent his anger at the iconic NBC show which is helmed by Canadian, Lorne Michaels.

Taking care to praise SNL as a promoter of comedic talent and a chief influence, Gary said he is not out to 'attack' the show, but wanted everyone to know his protégés performed their Turner sketch first, in September.

However, he goes on to say: 'But, over the years I have seen MANY MANY sketches flat out stolen from my friends by Saturday Night Live.

Defence: Ian Gary (right) took to social media over the weekend to point out the similarities between the Groundlings Tina Turner sketch and SNL's

'Nearly verbatim. Word for word... And everyone in our community goes 'Oh man. That sucks.' and nobody says anything because I guess SNL is still some dream for some people or they don't want to get involved, or a million other reasonable things that stop people from standing up for each other when things are blatantly wrong.'

To prove his point, Gary posted pictures to the social media network of the stars of Groundlings and SNL each wearing their very similar costumes.

Warming to his theme, Gary said that he felt that in this particular case, he had to speak out.

'This is stupid. And we have the means to make people aware of blatant rip offs of other peoples material,' wrote Gary.

'It doesn't need to be a witch hunt. It doesn't need to be pointing fingers, assigning blame, or taking sides. But a simple case of what's right and wrong.'

Kimberly Condict also wrote her opinion of the controversy as a post to Facebook.

'If you liked the sketch SNL did last night about a Tina Turner tribute band musing and singing to 'Rollin' on a River,' then you'll LOVE this sketch Vanessa Bruiser Ragland and I wrote and performed for six weeks this summer at Groundlings about a Tina Turner tribute band musing and singing to 'Rollin' on a River!'

A source at SNL told the Hollywood Reporter that they had no knowledge of the Groundlings sketch and totally refuted any accusations they stole it.

'It's a common idea since Tina Turner is such an iconic figure. The similarities represent parallel thinking in the comedy world,' the source said.
