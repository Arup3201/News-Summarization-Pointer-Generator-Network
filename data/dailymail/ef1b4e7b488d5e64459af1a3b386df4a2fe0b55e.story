A young mother so wanted to live the life of a 'normal teenager' that she left her baby with a known heroin addict, even changing her phone number so the woman could not contact her.

Desiree Ann-Marie Cozzoni of St. Charles, Missouri, then decided to report to authorities that her 16-month-old son had been kidnapped, which led to her arrest on charges of making a false report and endangering the welfare of a child.

She was also charged with unlawful use of drug paraphernalia when police found a pipe containing marijuana residue in her purse while booking her.

Cozzoni, 18, drew up nonlegal documents earlier this month signing over custody of her child to a woman she sometimes stayed with and who often used heroin in the presence of the young mother and her son.

Police told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the woman, whose name has not been released, 'stayed at motels because she was homeless, unemployed and had lost custody of her own children.'

Then, sometime during the week of October 6, Cozzoni changed her phone number so the woman could not get in touch with her.

It is still uncertain why she decided to report her son had been kidnapped.

New home: It is believed that the toddler will now be taken in by Cozzoni's grandparents

Wild child: Cozzani was also charged with unlawful use of drug paraphernalia when police found a pipe containing marijuana residue in her purse while booking her

Even more disturbing is the fact that the young woman, whose Facebook is filled with photos of herself posing in front of mirrors, is smiling in her mugshot.

She was released on $2,500 bail on Tuesday, and it is believed her grandparents may take custody of the child.

Should that be the case, Cozzoni would not be permitted to live in their house, where she stays from time to time.
