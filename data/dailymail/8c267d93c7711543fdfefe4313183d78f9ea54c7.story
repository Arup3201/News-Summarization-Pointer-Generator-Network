Sarah Murnaghan, the 10-year-old girl who underwent a double lung transplant after her family launched a national campaign, has taken 'a tiny step in the right direction', her mother has said.

The youngster, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, underwent the life-saving procedure last Wednesday and has been in intensive care ever since.

'Sarah made a tiny step in the right direction, being able to back off some of her vent settings in terms of her O2 requirements,' her mother Janet Ruddock Murnaghan posted on Facebook.

'Sarah's x-rays improved a little today too. She is still fully sedated and critical.'

Sarah's parents, from Newtown Square,
Pennsylvania, were briefed on her progress throughout the six-hour 
procedure last week. Surgeons had no challenges resizing or 
transplanting the lungs.

'We
expect it will be a long road, but we're not going for easy, we're 
going for possible,' Sarah's mother wrote on Facebook after the 
operation. 'And an organ donor has made this possible for her.'

Sarah's plight sparked a national 
debate over organ transplant policies, which until now barred children 
younger than 12 from the adult waiting list.

On Wednesday, Sarah's mother said that a set of lungs had become available for her daughter.

'God is great! He moved the mountain! 
Sarah got THE CALL,' a statement posted on her Facebook page read. 
'Please pray for Sarah's donor, her HERO, who has given her the 
gift of life.'

On Wednesday afternoon, Sarah's mother spoke to a reporter from Fox 29
about her daughter's searching, describing the family as being nervous 
but  'excited' about the surgery because doctors had given her child 
about a week to live, and they were out of options.

'We're just so thankful for the donor,' Ruddock Murnaghan said, adding that while it is a great day for her, it is not lost on her that it is a tragic day for the donor's family, who had lost a loved one.

Last week, the Murnaghans scored a
major victory when a judge ordered the Organ Procurement and 
Transplantation Network to add the 10-year-old to the list for adult 
lungs.

The family's battle waged in the 
media and on social networks has inspired other parents of children in dire need of organ transplants to 
challenge the existing lung allocation process.

Javier Acosta, 11, who suffers from 
the same illness as Sarah, is now also awaiting a new set of lungs at 
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where the little girl is currently 
undergoing surgery.

On Wednesday, Mrs Murnaghan said
that had it not been for the judge's recent ruling, they would not have
gotten this set of lungs, which likely came from an adult or teenager.

'Sarah would've been number 400 or something on the list,' she said.

The Organ Procurement and 
Transplantation Network added the 10-year-old to the list on Wednesday night after 
U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson's original ruling on June 5th..

The
ruling applied only to Sarah, who has end-stage cystic fibrosis and has
been awaiting a transplant at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

An expert has questioned the decision on medical and ethical grounds.

Lung transplants are the most difficult of organ transplants, and children fare worse than adults, which is one reason for the existing policy, said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University Langone Medical Center.

He called it troubling, and perhaps precedent-setting, for a judge to overrule that medical judgment, and predicted a run to the courthouse by patients who don't like their place on the waiting list.

'I'm not sure I want judges or congressmen or bureaucrats trying to decide what to do with organs at the bedside,' Caplan said.

The Murnaghans said pediatric lungs are rarely donated, so they believe older children should have equal access to adult donations.

Nationwide, about 1,700 people are on the waiting list for a lung transplant, including 31 children under age 11, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.

The Murnaghans' attorney, Steve Harvey, said a committee of the organization that sets transplants policy may meet next week and he hoped it would change the policy.

Joel Newman, spokesman for the United Network for Organ Sharing that operates the nation's transplant network, said he was unaware of any previous court order that overruled a transplant policy.
