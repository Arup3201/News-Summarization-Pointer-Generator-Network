Police discovered human remains off the coast of Maine on Sunday that may belong to one of two college students who disappeared from the area in December.

Zachary Wells, 21, of Burlington, Vermont, and Prescott Wright, 23, of Barnstable, Massachusetts, went missing near Cape Porpoise - where the remains were found - in the early morning hours of December 20.

The remains were transported the Maine Medical Examiner's Office for identification, which could take several days.

Police discovered human remains off the coast of Maine on Sunday that may belong to one of the two college students who disappeared

Wells and Wright were last seen by friends drinking beer at Wells' home
in Kennebunkport, Maine around midnight on December 19.

But when one of Wells' roommates went downstairs to turn off a radio at 4 a.m., neither man was there. The two men had left their cellphones and wallets at the home.

They were students at The Landing School in Arundel, Maine, where they were learning boat building and yacht design.

When the men failed to show up for classes on Thursday and Friday, administrators at the school contacted police.

Authorities found no signs of a disturbance at the home, Sanford said, and searches of the nearby area did not turn up any clues

Only one of the men owns a vehicle, and it remained parked in the driveway of the house.

Rescuers searched every
inch of the waters off Cape Porpoise in Kennebunkport by air, land and sea and have found 
only a set of clothes that may have belonged to one of the friends.

The disappearance of the two friends baffled authorities.

'There's no one area to pinpoint 
because we don't know where they might have gone,' said Sanford, calling
it one of the strangest cases he has ever seen.

Both men were expected to head to their home states for the holidays.

'These are two students without a history of disappearing or unexplained absences,' Robert DeColfmacker, president of the Landing School, told the Portland Press Herald.

Sanford said authorities do not know when or 
how Prescott and Wells left the home but assume they left together.

'We have no idea how they left, or why,' he said. 'The whole thing is perplexing to us.'

He added that they had searched the nearby water due to its proximity to the home and had no 'hard facts' that suggested had actually gone there.

The friends were supposed to be 
returning to their home states for the holidays.

Wells is from 
Burlington, Vermont, and Wright is from Barnstable, Massachusetts.

Wright's
family has not commented on the disappearance, but Wells' father, Jim 
Wells, told the Press Herald that everyone he has met in Maine has been 
helpful.

'I have nothing to add other than to say [Zachary] is a great kid,' he said.

Wells is white, 5-feet, 8-inches tall and around 150 pounds with black 
hair, hazel eyes and a surgical scar on his neck.

Wright is white, 6-foot-4, around 200 pounds with brown hair and blue eyes.

Anyone with information is asked to call the Kennebunkport Police Department at 207-967-2454.
