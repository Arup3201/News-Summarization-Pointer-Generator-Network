A mother-of-six has been arrested after allegedly beating her daughter with a belt and then sending her to school with humiliating comments about her failing grades scrawled across her T-shirt.

Melany Joyce Alexander, 30, reportedly assaulted the young girl at their home in Brooksville, Florida, after learning she had received a string of F grades at West Hernando Middle School.

She beat her with a 'leather belt with holes with metal divots', according to her arrest affidavit. The child was left with 'impressions in several places', including her arms, neck, chest, back and legs.

Alexander then sent her daughter to school dressed in a white T-shirt covered in magic marker, it is alleged. The writing referred to the girl's grades, and alluded to her not being allowed a boyfriend.

According to Action News, it read: 'I currently have all F's in all of my classes. I am not aloud to have a boyfriend no time soon. So back off before I get another good woopin like I got last night (sic).

'Also I can no longer have ANY friends until ALL of my F's are ALL brought up to C's and up! So unless you are helping me with this goal... back off! My eating french fries & being a social butterfly is over because I know why my parents send me to school. I now know the importance of my education.

'I will learn. I will listen to my teachers and be respectful, at all times. I will do these things because I am failing... due to my social life. Want to be my friend. Help me by NOT!'

After the girl arrived at the school, officials immediately provided her with a new shirt. They then contacted the police after allegedly spotting bruises and marks on her body, Fox News reported.

When Alexander was questioned at her home, she was initially uncooperative, it is said. However, she reportedly later admitted to hitting her daughter with a belt the previous day due to her grades.

The girl also allegedly confirmed to deputies her mother's admission that she had been beaten.

On her Facebook page, Alexander regularly shares photos of herself with her partner and her six children, including two daughters and four sons - two of whom are twins of around toddler age.

Alexander is currently being held in custody without bond.
