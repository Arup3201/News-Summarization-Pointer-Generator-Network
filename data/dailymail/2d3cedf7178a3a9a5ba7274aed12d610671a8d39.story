Two months after popping the champagne when Sunderland miraculously avoided relegation from the Premier League, striker Connor Wickham has been spotted partying hard with a £17,500 bottle of the stuff.

The 21-year-old is understood to have racked up a mind-boggling £25,000 bar bill while partying with pals at the Ocean Club in Marbella, with a 15-litre gold bottle of Armand De Brignac champagne the standout buy.

The English forward seemed more than happy to foot the bill for the extravagant drinks, which he generously shared with friends and even the waiters at the club in Puerto Banus.

The price of the bottle is the same as the annual starting salary at the Nissan car plant in Sunderland.

Wickham signed a four-year deal with Sunderland in 2011 to complete an £8million move from his home-town club Ipswich Town.

The striker’s wages trebled to £25,000-a-week as a result, though is in line for a new improved deal at the Stadium of Light after helping fire them to safety at the end of last season.

Recalled from his loan at Leeds in March to boost Sunderland’s striking options as they battled relegation, his goals were crucial in saving them from the drop.

He scored twice in a 2-2 draw with Manchester City at the Etihad and during the 2-1 win over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.

His brace of goals in a 4-0 win against Cardiff towards the end of April led to him being named Barclays Premier League Player of the Month.
