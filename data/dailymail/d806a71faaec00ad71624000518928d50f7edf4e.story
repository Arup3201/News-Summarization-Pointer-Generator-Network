Hong Kong police moved in to demolish the protesters' camp and arrest those who refused to leave today, but hardcore activists have vowed to continue to fight for democracy.

Police officers tore down barricades and tents which blocked a busy road for weeks, hauling out protesters who refused to budge. 

Hundreds of demonstrators chose to leave the site in the financial district of the city when police arrived, but many chanted: 'We will be back.'

The eight-carriage road in Hong Kong's financial district was cleared and re-opened for the first time since September today

At the protest site, authorities used around 20 large trucks with cranes to remove mountains of rubbish. By late evening, traffic had resumed along two lanes of the previously blocked highway. 

Hundreds of police officers swept through the area, checking tents before dragging them away along with metal barriers, plastic sheets and umbrellas, which activists had used during clashes to guard against pepper spray and baton blows.

As police piled up the remains of the two-month-long demonstration and piled them up on the pavement, protest leaders said they would return before long.

Hong Kong Federation of Students leader Alex Chow said: 'You might have the clearance today but people will come back on to the streets another day.' 

Another leader of the movement, Benny Tai, said: 'Blocking government may be even more powerful than blocking roads.

'Refusal to pay taxes, delaying rent payments ... and filibustering in the Legislative Council, along with other acts of non-cooperation, could make governing more inconvenient.'

Protester Andy Chu, who was among those waiting to be arrested, said the movement 'will move on to the next stage. 

'It's not about occupying the streets any more. It can be about paying attention to other political issues such as social welfare and housing issues,' he added.

Thee hundreds of tents that dotted the eight-lane highway have now been removed, with just a few dozen protesters left.

A large yellow banner bearing an umbrella and the words 'We'll be back' was draped in the centre of the highway where protesters had camped out, with similar messages scrawled on roads and posted on tents.

The protests, which were mostly peaceful, represented one of the most serious challenges to China's authority since the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square

The protests, which were mostly peaceful, represented one of the most serious challenges to China's authority since the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square and the bloody crackdown that followed.

The protests drew well over 100,000 at their peak as students vented their anger at Beijing's refusal to budge on electoral reform.

Anger began in September when citizens of Hong Kong were told China would vet all electoral candidates.

Protesters demanded open nominations in the city's next election for chief executive in 2017. Beijing has said it will allow a 2017 vote but only between pre-screened candidates.
