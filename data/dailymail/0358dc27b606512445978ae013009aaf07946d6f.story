The grandparents of a four-month-old girl orphaned after her father, a Kansas City Chiefs player, shot her mother and himself are locked in a custody battle over the $3million baby.

Linebacker Jovan Belcher shot daughter Zoey's mother, Kasandra Perkins, nine times on December 1 before driving to Arrowhead stadium and shooting himself.

Belcher's mother, Cheryl Shepherd, is seeking custody of Zoey and to be appointed conservator of her estate. The baby's maternal grandparents and other relatives in Texas are also seeking custody.

Custody battle: Belcher is seen here with his girlfriend Kasandra Perkins, 22, and their baby daughter Zoey who with their death is at the heart of a $3million custody battle

After her parent's death, Zoey was 
turned over to Belcher's mother by authorities but temporarily allowed 
Kasandra's parents to take her to Texas for her mother's funeral.

The maternal grandparents have now have cut off 
communication with Shepherd and have refused to return Zoey to their 
care, according to The Kansas City Star.

The other woman: Brittni Glass spent the night with Belcher before he murdered his girlfriend but has since denied the two had a sexual relationship

It is believed that the murder suicide took place after a row about whether or not Belcher was the Zoey's father.

His suicide was witnessed by coach Romeo Crennel and general manager Scott Pioli.

A source told the New York Post:
 '[Cheryl] believed that there was an issue over whether [Belcher] was
 the father. She said he believed he wasn’t necessarily the father of 
the child.'

A Kansas City law-enforcement source confirmed: 'She told police there was a question about the paternity.'

The
 source added: 'The implication was that paternity was what the two of 
them were fighting about — that the baby might not have been his.'

The couple had been receiving counselling for relationship and financial problems, police said.

A spokeswoman said she would not comment on the doubts raised over baby Zoey's paternity.

Hearings are scheduled this month to decide where the four-month-old will go and the money to support her.

Belcher's daughter is due to receive a sizeable income over her lifetime after the December murder suicide at 
the hands of her NFL player father.

Zoey's estate or guardian will also receive more than $1 million under the terms of the NFL's collective bargaining agreement.

She will receive $108,000 annually for the next four years, $48,000 in the fifth year and $52,000 every year until she turns 18.

If she goes to college it will last until she is 23.

The beneficiary will also receive $600,000 in life insurance and $200,000 for every season. Belcher was in his third.

A retirement 
account with $100,000 will also go to his estate.

Though there seemed to be no motive 
for the senseless killings, it emerged last month that the NFL player 
had a secret girlfriend who he allegedly told he would shoot Perkins 'if
 she didn't leave him alone'.

Belcher is also believed to have had 
drinks and dinner with Brittni Glass before he arrived home, shot his 
girlfriend after a blazing row, and then ended his own life.

Details of the Belcher case are contained in police reports submitted to the Jackson County prosecutor, who has ruled the event a murder-suicide. They include dozens of interviews with witnesses.

Glass has denied the two were in a relationship.

Glass, also 22, told police that Belcher complained about Perkins threatening to take all his money and the baby if they broke up.

He said Perkins 'knew exactly how to press his buttons and make him angry,' according to a summary of the woman's interview with police.

Belcher had been with the woman and some of her friends at a downtown Kansas City entertainment district the night before the shooting, the woman said. He spent part of the night in her apartment and part of it sleeping in his car before going home early in the morning, the report said.

He and Perkins were arguing before he shot her, his mother, Cheryl Shepherd, told police. Shepherd had moved in with the couple two weeks earlier to help care for the baby. Shepherd heard Belcher say 'You won't talk to me that way' and then she heard a thump and gunshots.

Shepherd rushed into the bedroom and found Perkins lying on the bathroom floor, she told police. Before fleeing the house, Belcher knelt next to Perkins, apologized and repeatedly kissed her, his daughter and his mother, Shepherd said.

Troubled: The murder-suicide has sparked debate in the NFL about gun ownership and the personal struggles of players

Belcher drove off in his Bentley to 
the practice facility at Arrowhead several miles away, where he pulled 
into the parking lot and saw Pioli, the report said.

Pioli quoted Belcher as saying, 'I 
did it, I killed her.' Belcher held a handgun to his own head. 'I got to
 go, can't be here, and take care of my daughter,' Pioli recalled 
Belcher saying.

He had asked to speak with Crennel 
and linebacker coach Gary Gibbs, the report said. Crennel told police he
 pleaded with Belcher to put down the gun. One witness said she heard 
Crennel say, 'you're taking the easy way out'.

Belcher lowered the gun, but only to load a round into the chamber, Crennel told police. Seeing a police officer in the distance and hearing sirens, Belcher knelt behind a mini-van, blessed himself and fired the gun into his temple, the report said.

It had also been reported that there were questions over the paternity of Zoey and Cheryl said that this is what they argued over before the shooting.

Paying respects: Hundreds of mourners memorialized Jovan Belcher at his funeral - despite his murdering the mother of his child before committing suicide

Memorial: Jovan Belcher was eulogized as a 'humble, kind young man' by his mother as his family and friends grappled with the horror of what he did

Cheryl Shepherd was in the home when 
her son shot Kasandra ten times before fleeing. He is believed to have 
kissed her dying body and their baby daughter goodbye before he left.

The horrific murder suicide has shaken the NFL and begun a discussion of gun ownership and mental health issues.

At least seven players have given up their guns - handing them over to the security personnel for their teams, Sports Illustrated reports.

The funeral was at Upper Room Christian Church in Dix Hills, New York, near his hometown on Long Island

Then appeared the words 'In loving memory of' Belcher and Kasandra Perkins.

After a series of pictures of Perkins and baby Zoey came the message, 'Keep this little girl in your prayers.'

'The legacy we pass on to her will be good,' said his uncle, Davin Miles.

Next
 to an open casket at his funeral were collages of photos and mementos from Belcher's 
playing career. An array of flowers spelled out W.B. for his high 
school.

Belcher then drove to Arrowhead 
Stadium, where he thanked coach Romeo Crennel and general manager Scott 
Pioli for all they'd done for him. As police arrived, Belcher slipped 
behind a car and put the gun to his head.

His
 path to becoming an NFL starter had been an unlikely one. Belcher did 
not play in college football's top division, and he wasn't drafted. But 
he made the Chiefs, becoming a full-time starter in 2010.

Bishop
 Stephanie Green described Belcher as 'a man who did some awesome things
 - while other young men his age were out hustling, slinging and doing 
other things, he chose an education'.
