A student is fundraising for children with cancer after he defied medical odds by beating a brain tumour three times.

Chandos Green, a student at Chichester University, West Sussex, must still have annual MRI scans after he endured three risky surgeries merely to survive to the age of 19.

And now, just months after his last operation, he is already training for the 2015 London Marathon in the hope he can raise thousands for the charity Children With Cancer UK.

Survivor: Chandos Green, 19, who has battled a life-threatening tumour three times. Right shows the scar on his head from his most-recent operation to remove the tumour at Southampton General Hospital

Fighter: Despite surviving his last brush with death less than a year ago, Chichester University student Mr Green is now training to run the London Marathon this year to raise money for a cancer charity

Speaking of his latest brush with death - only averted when surgeons removed a golf ball-sized tumour - Mr Green said: 'I remember asking the surgeon if I was going to die and I broke down when I was going under the anaesthetic.

'Luckily I was fine and managed to beat the tumour once again. But the operation made me realise that life can be short.'

Mr Green, from Bournemouth, Dorset, appeared to be a healthy toddler until, at the age of three, he began suffering dizzy spells and falling over unexpectedly.

After his worried mother took him to see their family doctor, her son was referred to Poole hospital where specialists diagnosed a brain tumour.

Brain surgeons at Southampton General Hospital were able to remove most of the tumour, but were unable to take out parts that were close to Mr Green's motor neurons - the essential circuits that connect the brain to the muscles.

Mr Green remembered: 'When they discovered the tumour I was still really young but I remember being in the hospital and being confused by it all.

'I recovered quickly from the operation and managed to start school but that's when the problems started.

'Initially people didn't say anything about my scars but then people kept coming up to me and asking what happened to my head.

'They began to notice the tumour had given me a limp and I had lost movement in my left wrist.'

Fighting for his life: A picture of Mr Green aged three recovering from the first of his operations to remove the tumour in his brain. It was diagnosed after he began suffering dizzy spells and falling over

Tests: Mr Green aged five. Despite the success of Mr Green's first operation, his symptoms soon returned and he was forced to undergo a second operation at the age of six to again remove his brain tumour

Recovery: Mr Green aged six, following his second operation. He remained cancer free for the next 13 years until he enrolled at Chichester University, when the familiar symptoms began to reappear

With the same symptoms reappearing just a couple of years after his first fight with the tumour, a new MRI scan showed Mr Green's tumour had regrown. Aged just six, he was once again forced to go under the surgeon's knife for a risky operation to remove the growth and save his life.

Again he recovered and returned to school. But this time he fell victim to cruel classroom bullies who dubbed him 'tumour boy'.

Despite the taunts, Mr Green rebuilt his life, enjoying a normal adolescence and completing his GCSEs and A-levels. But when he enrolled at Chichester to begin his degree, all-too-familiar symptoms began to return.

'I started studying social work and the beginning of it was great until I started to get headaches.

'One day when I woke up early to go on a trip and I fainted in my room and woke up three hours later.

'It was then that I realised that something wasn't right and I went to the hospital to get some checks done.'

Just a day after his 19th birthday, Chandos received the devastating news he would have to battle the life-threatening disease for a third time.

'I was now old enough to fully understand what was going on and I was so scared going into the operation,' he said.

Steve Clifford, a Professor of Molecular Paediatric Oncology at Newcastle University, said: 'It is possible that some brain tumours may return some time after they were first treated.

'However it is rare for a brain tumour return three times, especially when the individual's lay dormant for 12 years.'
