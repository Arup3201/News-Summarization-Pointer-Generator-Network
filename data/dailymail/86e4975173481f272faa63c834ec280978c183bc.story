Objecting to the referee only four days before the biggest fight in post-war Britain is just the latest quirk from George Groves and he will enjoy the war of nerves even though his appeal failed.

Groves, who will exchange grudge-laden championship blows with Carl Froch at Wembley Stadium on Saturday night, is clearly a boxer with a difference.

He split with his trainer just before his first tilt at Froch’s world super-middleweight title, and this is the same eccentric who has just signed for a German promoter on the eve of the rematch which will make him a superstar in Britain, win or lose.

Bad blood: The incident is the latest in a heated build-up between Froch (left) and Groves (right)

Having insisted he would not fight Froch a second time if either the referee or the judges were British, he staged his late protest against American Charlie Fitch being the third man in the ring.

Since Froch’s promoter Eddie Hearn had already asked for another US referee, David Reiss, to be replaced, this may have been as much a tit-for-tat reaction as a suspicion that Fitch’s style might help his opponent.

Boxers usually leave the wheeling and dealing to their managers. When Groves dispensed with Adam Booth, who doubled as his trainer, on the November eve of Froch-Groves I, he then had to hire the lesser-known Paddy Fitzpatrick to work his corner.

Fitzpatrick is now established as his trainer but Groves takes care of his own business. But why burden himself with the potentially distracting extra workload?

‘That part’s simple,’ he says. ‘I no longer trust anyone else to look after me and my money.’

So,
 as if preparing to fight a three-time champion in Froch’s 12th 
consecutive world title fight is not enough, the 26-year-old Groves took
 out a British Boxing Board of Control licence to manage himself.

Shortly
 before his work-out in front of hundreds of fellow Londoners at the 
Westfield shopping centre on Tuesday, he found time to lodge his 
complaint about the ref.

Raring to go: Groves has predicted he'll knock out Froch in three rounds on Saturday night

He did so knowing that it might not be possible for a second substitute to be found and flown to London in time to undergo the British board’s stringent medical checks.

By now the IBF, whose world 
super-middleweight title is at stake along with a WBA belt, could be 
forgiven for wishing they had not acceded to Groves’s petition for this 
rematch following Froch’s controversial win first time out.

Groves scorned legal representation at that hearing, paying for his trip to New Jersey and arguing his own case.

He
 then opposed the use of any British officials, so upset was he with the
 premature stoppage inflicted by home referee Howard Foster.

Controversy: There has been bad blood between the pair since Froch was deemed to have beaten Groves in November

Again he succeeded, though by laying claim to the position of mandatory title challenger he shot himself in the foot financially. In these circumstances, the IBF stipulate that the defending champion receives up to 85 per cent of the purse.

So while Froch can bank between £5-10million for Saturday night’s work, depending on the size of the pay-per-view audience, Groves is believed to be receiving around £1.5m. He shrugs and says: ‘After I’ve knocked out Carl my big pay-days will come.’

Groves has also vetoed one of the three foreign judges, because he hails from Poland, where Froch’s family have their roots. ‘Can’t be too careful,’ he grins.

All smiles: Groves was in relaxed mood at his public work-out session just four days before his fight with Froch

Rejected: Froch's promoter Eddie Hearn has already turned down David Reiss as a possible official for the fight

Maybe it’s all part of the mind games with which he drove Froch into getting so angry and careless in their first fight that he lunged on to the blow which floored him in the first round.

‘I leave nothing to chance,’ Groves continues. ‘He needs to understand that his destiny is dawning. And while I’m sure he’s good enough to win I won’t allow him to win.’

Statements like that irritated the public too, five months ago. So having predicted, in the idiom of Muhammad Ali, the precise right-hand punch and the moment he would knock Froch down, he compares himself with The Greatest.

‘Ali was very unpopular in America for some time but he became an idol there and worldwide,’ he says.

Do not discount more disputes at the final eyeball to eyeball press conference on Thursday.

Froch-Groves II will be televised live on Sky Sports Box Office on Saturday night, at £16.95
