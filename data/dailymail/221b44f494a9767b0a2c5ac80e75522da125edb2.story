Abusive: Lorenzo Segundo, 19, allegedly beat to death a Chihuahua a year after being accused of shooting another dog with a BB gun

A 19-year-old man who allegedly brutally beat a Chihuahua to death with a wooden plank has been charged with animal cruelty a year after being accused of shooting a neighbor's dog with a BB gun.

Police said Lorenzo Segundo from Atwater, California, beat the tiny canine with a fence paling after it approached his Pit Bull near the 2800 block of Muir Ave about 7.40pm Wednesday.

Witnesses claim they heard the battered puppy screeching as Segundo hit it up to seven times before dumping its lifeless body in a nearby trash can.

Atwater Police Department spokesman William Novetzke said neighbors reported the incident after watching it unfold.

'They're the ones that made the case in 
contacting law enforcement, letting them know what occurred,' Novetzke told abc30.

'It was tough to see the dog injured the way it was.'

Police said the dog - believed to be a stray - likely died of head trauma.

The small canine suffered eye socket, skull and vertebrae fractures, and bled from its right ear canal and mouth, according to Merced Sun-Star.

Segundo was booked at the Merced County Jail on suspicion of felony animal cruelty, and has posted bail and been released.

Merced Sun-Star has reported the teen has a history of animal abuse, allegedly shooting a neighbor's dog with a BB gun last year.

However no charges were filed because of lack of evidence.
