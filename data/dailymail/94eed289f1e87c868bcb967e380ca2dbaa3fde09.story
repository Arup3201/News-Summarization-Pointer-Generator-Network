There's something quite remarkable happening down at Swindon this season.

It's newsworthy enough that a team on a shoestring budget with a little-known manager and no household names are second in the League One table.

But a look at the ages of Mark Cooper's players reveals the magnitude of their achievement so far.

Saturday's 2-1 win at pre-season promotion favourites Leyton Orient saw Cooper name a side with an average age of just 21.9.

To put that in context: the youngest player in Manchester City's matchday squad against Aston Villa on Saturday was Eliaquim Mangala at 23.

At 28, common wisdom has it that Andy Williams is in the prime of his career, yet the Swindon striker must feel like a veteran among Cooper's kids. His next-youngest team-mate is Jonathan Obika, 24.

In fact, of the 24 players Cooper has used in all competitions this season, only three are above the age of 23.

Cooper is best remembered for his ill-fated spell at Peterborough in the 2009-10 season. He won just one of 13 games in the Championship and was soon back in non-league, where he had made his name with Kettering, and seemingly on the managerial scrapheap.

Fate gave the 45-year-old an unlikely second bite at the cherry in Football League management, albeit in a caretaker role, when Kevin McDonald resigned as Swindon manager in July 2013.

An impressive start to last season convinced the Swindon board to make Cooper's step up from assistant to manager permanent and their faith was justified with an eighth-placed finish last season.

For a club walking a financial tightrope after 18 months of over-spending under Paolo di Canio that was quite an achievement, especially given the mass exodus of players that Cooper oversaw.

But, although it may not have seemed that way when Cooper was given the job 14 months ago, there was a plan in place to secure Swindon's future by putting faith in a strong crop of academy players and loaning youngsters from Premier League clubs.

They couldn't have imagined it would go this well though.

Cooper has Swindon playing a possession-based game using the same 3-5-2 system we saw so often at the World Cup. Against Orient, they had 62 per cent of the ball.

It's a joy to watch, or as Cooper said himself on Saturday: 'Some of the football was amazing. They're young players and they're getting better and better.'

If last season exceeded expectations, then this campaign could well go down in footballing folklore if Swindon can maintain their form and win promotion.

To repeat: the average age of Cooper's starting line-up is under 22. There are no veterans hiding away on the bench or in the reserves either. The average age of Cooper's 24-man squad? 21.1.

There is much debate to be had over whether there are 'right' or 'wrong' ways to do things in football, but however you like your bread buttered, you can't help but admire what's going on at Swindon.

Good week for... CARLISLE. The Cumbrians are off the foot of the League Two table after a 3-0 win at Hartlepool saw Keith Curle's side leapfrog their opponents. The relegation hangover may finally have gone after two wins on the spin.

Bad week for... BOLTON. It seems the majority of Wanderers fans were glad to see the back of Dougie Freedman when he left the club last week. But Saturday's 2-1 defeat at home to Bournemouth shows there's no quick fix to Bolton's problems.

Talent scout: Eoin Doyle (Chesterfield)

Doyle's incredible goalscoring run continued on Saturday as he scored his 13th goal in 11 games as Chesterfield ran out 3-2 winners over Sheffield United in League One. The 26-year-old Irishman, signed from Hibernian in May 2013, has scored more than anyone else in the country this season.
