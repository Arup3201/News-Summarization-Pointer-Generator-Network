Jailed: Julie Hautzenroeder, 37, has been jailed for two years

A teacher jailed for two years for having sex with a student, 16, has been granted permission to spend Christmas with her daughter before starting her sentence.

Julie Hautzenroeder, 37, of Loveland had been a Colerain High science teacher for 10 years.

She was sentenced on Wednesday, but will not start her sentence until January 13th.

Earlier this year she admitted to exchanging 
inappropriate texts with a teen.

But a police investigation revealed 
that she had one of her friends drive two 16-year-old Colerain sophomore
boys to her home.

The teens testified she gave them alcohol and 
marijuana and had sex with them.

A jury last month convicted 
Hautzenroeder of one count of sexual battery but ruled she was not 
guilty on the other.

She faced a maximum prison sentence of five years.

'She is in a position of authority and trust, which was violated,' Hamilton County Common Pleas Court Judge Norbert Nadel said.

'Parents do not send their kids to school to engage in this type of behavior with the teachers,' he said reported USA Today.

Hautzenroeder, a single parent, had begged the judge not to send her to prison because it would hurt her daughter.

'I ask you, not for me but for my daughter who I have been the only parent to for her entire life, please please ... I can't stand her not to be able to have the Christmas she's relied on her entire life.'

WPCO reported that in closing arguments, prosecutor Josh Burkowitz said Hautzenroederâ€™s alleged sex acts with the two teens were intentional and not some accident.

He said text messages between her and one student that referred to a sex act were incredibly incriminating.

But the biology teacher's lawyer, Stewart Mathews, argued Hautzenroeder had made serious lapses in judgment by inviting the teens to her Loveland condo, but claimed the teenagers were drug users and liars.

Hautzenroeder said she 'never had sex with teens' and told them to sleep on the couch.

She claimed that one of them climbed on top of her during the night.

She also denied giving alcohol and claimed they brought the marijuana.

Hautzenroeder will also have to register as a sex offender for life - that means she will have to report to the sheriff's office every 90 days.
