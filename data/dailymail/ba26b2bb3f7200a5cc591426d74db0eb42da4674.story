Water companies were yesterday ordered to slash bills – but will still end up charging households more because of inflation.

Regulator Ofwat told suppliers to reduce average customer bills by 5 per cent by 2020, a £20 drop from £396 to £376.

In a new five-year plan, they must also invest £44billion to help stem water leaks by 370million litres a day and curb the hours homes are left without water because of repair works.

Water companies were today ordered to cut bills by an average of 5 per cent by 2020 - but only after inflation

But customers are set to end up paying more because firms can increase bills annually in line with RPI (Retail Price Index) inflation – currently 2.3 per cent. Many homes will see bills of more than £400 for the first time next year. By 2020, assuming the same inflation rate, they could be £420.

It will be a particular blow for older customers on a limited income since state benefits and many occupational pensions only rise in line with CPI (Consumer Price Index) inflation which is a much lower 1.3 per cent.

In a bid to support the worst off, Ofwat is to ensure companies offer social tariffs to an extra million households. These deals offer discounts of up to 25 per cent off regular water bills.

A key factor behind Ofwat’s demand for lower bills has been the cheaper cost of borrowing for water companies to fund their infrastructure projects. 

Cathryn Ross, Ofwat chief executive, said: ‘With bills held down by 5 per cent and service driven up over the next five years, customers will get more and pay less.' 

Jonson Cox, chairman of Ofwat, said: ‘We are bringing down bills so customers can expect value for money, while investors can earn a fair return.

‘Companies will need to stretch themselves to deliver much more with the same level of funding as in previous years.’

Northumbrian customers however will see the smallest change in their bills, dropping 1 per cent to £382

Tony Smith, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water, said he was broadly pleased that customers could expect decreases in bills without compromising services.

However, he warned the range of deals pegging prices to inflation could still result in bills increasing for many customers.

He said: ‘It’s been the best process for the customer than any price review since privatisation.’

However, he added: ‘Ofwat has been generous to the sector over several previous reviews.’
