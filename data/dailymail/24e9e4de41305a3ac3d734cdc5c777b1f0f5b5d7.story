She made headlines earlier this week after revealing her double life as a high-class escort and a mother.

Now Amanda Goff has hit back at her critics through a lengthy article in which she claims her life remains boring and normal after the media storm.

The 40-year-old dismissed criticism that her children were negatively affected by her career choice, writing in the Herald Sun: 'Professions do not define our parenting skills'.

Amanda Goff has hit back at criticism of her parenting skills after she publicly announced she works both as an escort and in her children's school canteen

Ms Goff has two children under the age of seven who she shares custody with her former partner

'So far, the only thing we had to deal with at school this week was my son getting hit on the head with a soccer ball, which caused a few tears.

'So, while I appreciate your concern, my kids are fine, thank you very much. How are yours?'

The mother-of-two described her initial anxiety on her way to her casual job at her children's canteen, where she feared she would be faced with criticism from mothers and children.

Instead the former journalist, who formerly worked as a news editor for New Idea, a beauty director for InStyle and as a freelance producer for Seven's Today Tonight, said she was faced with another ordinary day within a casually boring week.

'Yep, when I think about the endless cups of tea I've drunk, the track suit pants I've lived in and the cat I had to take to the vet; life has been prrretty boring,' she wrote of the last week.

The high-class escort, who goes by the name of Samantha X, was a former journalist who worked for New Idea and InStyle

The ex-husband of Amanda Goff, David Basha, has broken his silence on his former wife's tell-all interview

Ms Goff also claimed that her current job as a sex worker, is more ethical than her former career as a journalist in which she admits she hid in bushes and illegally hacked phones.

She also defended her decision to go public with her real name in a tell-all-interview with Channel Seven's Sunday Night - after publishing her book under the name 'Samantha X' - claiming she preferred to have control rather than fearing being ousted by another reporter.

The article was published only two days after Ms Goff's ex-husband, Sydney banker David Basha, told Daily Mail Australia that he was disgusted with his former wife's decision to publicly announce her identity.

Ms Goff revealed she worked as a $800 an hour sex worker one week, and in her children's tuck shop the next.

'It's a disgrace. I have had to explain to my kids what's going on,' Mr Basha said.

'I'm worried about my family, I just really want to leave my kids out of this.'

Ms Goff spends one week as a full-time mother to her children - who she shares custody with her former partner - and the next in a luxury apartment in Sydney's CBD where she carries out her life as Samantha X. 

The mother-of-two charges $800 an hour or $5,000 a night for her time

Ms Goff said despite what many may think, her work as an escort wasn't all about sex.

'I haven't had sex for ages actually... I'm like a naked therapist,' she told Kyle and Jackie O's radio program Kiis on Monday.

'A lot of men have told me about putting their dogs down and I've wiped away a lot of tears. They're paying for my time, so what they do in that time is really up to them.

'I have champagne and beer but they often want a cup of tea.

'It is an empowered job for a woman and I think we all have the right… as long as we're not hurting anyone.'
