There was further disappointment for the bankrupt city of Detroit on Wednesday when it was announced that a $6million bid to turn one of the city’s crumbling factories into a thriving international business has once again evaporated. 

In its 1950s heyday, the Packard Automotive Plant had been at the hub of the city’s once-formidable manufacturing base but in recent year it has become a symbol of Detroit's decay.

Officials in Wayne County were shocked on Friday when a last-minute bidding war skyrocketed the price of the iconic auto plant during the final hours of a tax foreclosure auction.

The winner was Jill Van Horn, a family doctor from Ennis, Texas, who bid $6,038,000 for a dilapidated site, after the bidding had started at just $21,000.

Van Horn was reported to be teaming up with ‘partners and investors from Detroit, Wall Street and international firms,’ to turn the decrepit site into an ‘economic engine’ that was going to become part of what many hoped would be the city’s great revival.

According to Dave Marshall, a spokesman for the investment group, the goal was to produce modular homes at the old Packard factory, ‘(which) will be constructed on the site and shipped all over the world’, reports CBS Detroit.

Then on Wednesday, the Wayne County Treasurer’s Office announced that it had been forced to cancel her bid after Van Horn and her investors had failed to come through with the required down payment.

Smoke and flames rise from a deteriorating building at a former Packard plant in Detroit. One rescue plan after another has collapsed, including one to turn the facility into a modern mixed-use complex of shops, restaurants and other venues

A man takes a picture of deteriorating buildings: While it isn't unheard of for a bid to fall through after the bidding process was complete, the collapse of this deal is just the latest example of bad luck to befall the plant

‘We needed to hear from them by noon that by close of business  today we would have a down payment of $2 million towards the $6 million made,’ said treasurer’s office Dave Szymanski.

‘We did not hear back, and so pursuant to the directions of Treasurer Wojtowicz, we did cancel their sale,’ Szymanski said.

Local officials have confirmed that they
are once against talking with other bidders for the abandoned former 
Detroit car plant.

Ruins at the abandoned Packard Automotive Plant: The 3.5 million square foot car manufacturing plant built was completed in 1911 and major operations ceased in 1958

Whoever next attempts to kick-start will have a massive job on their hands.

The sprawling, 35-acre complex consists of 40 individual buildings, most in serious need of repair, reports NBCNews. 

The car manufacturing plant built was completed in 1911. Major operations ceased in 1958, though the plant was used in a limited capacity until the 1990s, with outer buildings used through the mid 2000s.

Since then the buildings have fallen into disrepair and the property has increasingly became a target of arsonists, thieves, metal scrappers, urban explorers and graffiti artists.

Detroit has an astonishing 78,000 abandoned buildings across its 142 square miles. Last month the city declared bankruptcy, the largest municipality to ever do so in the United States.
