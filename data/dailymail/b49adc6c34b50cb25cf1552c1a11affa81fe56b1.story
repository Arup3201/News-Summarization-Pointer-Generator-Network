Tesco has unveiled a free TV and movie service for its 16m Clubcard customers.

The supermarket, which last year bought online film service Blinkbox, hopes the service will help it take on Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google in the lucrative TV market.

Customers will get the service for free in return for watching adverts before and after TV shows and films.

The Clubcard TV service, announced today, will allow Clubcard owners to watch films and TV shows for free if they agree to watch personalised ads

Tesco will link the service to its Clubcard so users will be shown ads for products they may actually buy, or have bought in the past.

The service will analyse all of their Clubcard purchases to select the best ads.

The supermarket boasts it will take less than 24 hours for purchases to be reflected in the ads customers are shown

'Clubcard TV offers a whole world of 
free entertainment for all the family,' said Michael Comish, CEO of 
Tesco Digital Entertainment.

'The reason we can offer great 
programming for free is because customers will see relevant advertising 
before and during the movie or TV show they are watching.

'We’ll use Clubcard data to tell us 
what might be relevant for our customers and therefore help us deliver a
more personalised service.'

Clubcard TV MD Scott Deutrom said the adverts would be selected based on 'live' data.

'By using Clubcard, we can look at what customers buy from us, what things they like, and then make an effort to target adverts that are more relevant to them.

'Better still, we can target adverts based on what our customers bought yesterday, we can show that we are listening to our customers in ‘real’ time.'

Tesco TV: The Only Way Is Essex is one of the first TV shows to be confirmed for the new service, which will be available for free to Clubcard holders

The service will pit Tesco against Apple's iTunes store, Netflix and Lovefilm, the Amazon-owned online streaming service.

Google also sells and rents TV shows in its Google Play store.

Titles available at launch include 
the Brad Pitt western The Assassination of Jesse James, The Shawshank 
Redemption and the TV shows The Only Way is Essex, Doc Martin and The 
Real Hustle (DRG).

Kids’ content available from launch 
includes The Wind in the Willows movie starring Matt Lucas and The Care 
Bears and Strawberry Shortcake TV series from distributor American 
Greetings.

Tesco also recently aquired ebook firm Mobcast and online music streaming service WE7.
