Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has urged yes and no campaigners to move forward following yesterday's decisive referendum result, saying 'the war of words is done…it's time to unite'.

Mr Brown said opposing voters must 'move from the battle ground to the common ground...to find a way forward for the future'. 

At a speech in Fife, a day after Scotland voted to remain part of the Union, Mr Brown also pledged that the promises made on further devolution would be delivered.

Gordon Brown said yes and no campaigners must now unite and urged the country to move forward during a speech in Fife, Scotland, today

The former Labour leader, whose intervention in the referendum campaign has been credited with helping to secure the No vote, said: 'We can find ways to unify against the odds. 

'There is a time to fight but there is a time to unite and this is the time for Scotland to unite and see if it can find common purpose and move from the battle ground to the common ground and let us seek to find high ground in trying to find a way forward for the future.'

'Today I want to set out proposals that might be discussed across the country that might unite this country around a set of common causes we can all endorse, Yes and No campaigners.

'The eyes of the world have been upon us and now I think the eyes of the world are on the leaders of the major parties of the United Kingdom. These are men who have been promise makers and they will not be promise breakers.

Alex Salmond yesterday announced that he would step down as First Minister in November following the confirmation that his 'Yes' campaign had lost by 10 per cent

'I will ensure that as a promise keeper that these promises that have been made will be upheld.

'We will lock in today the promises that have been made and why the timetable we set out will be delivered. Action has already been taken to make sure that happens.'

The biggest victim of the referendum battle was Alex Salmond, who announced hours after the result that he would quit as First Minister and Scottish National Party leader.

In a passionate speech delivered in Fife today, former PM Gordon Brown set out a schedule for the devolution of powers to Scotland:

Mr Brown praised the First Minister for his years of service and said the people of Scotland of Scotland owed him a debt of gratitude.

Mr Salmond dramatically resigned yesterday afternoon just hours after voters rejected independence.

He announced his departure at a press conference saying 'party, Parliament and country' would benefit from 'new leadership'.

But he fired a warning shot at David Cameron not to go back on his promise to transfer sweeping new powers to Holyrood within six months.

In Mr Brown's speech today he also spoke of the need to revitalise industry in Scotland, claiming the country must adapt to changes in the world. 

He said: 'The quarrel is not with England, the real quarrel is with globalization and the changes and we have got to manage it for good or it will enforce injustices upon us.'

Mr Brown also spelled out his timetable for constitutional change and devolution of powers to Scotland, following the signing of a resolution by the leaders of the three major political parties. 

He said: 'Immediately after the referendum, in discussions with the leaders of the parties, lock-in measure one was taken, a resolution that is issued today, was submitted, that will be placed in the House of Commons on Monday.

'Second, what we can call lock-in measure two: having taken the unusual step of approaching the civil service, I have a direct assurance that while September 18 was decision day, September 19 was delivery day and today, September 20, is delivery day and every day thereafter is delivery day until a new Scotland Act comes into being, to ensure the timetable is honoured and upheld.

'But third, what I will call lock-in measure three: to ensure proper scrutiny of the timetable I will lead a debate in the House of Commons in its first week back on October 16.

He excitedly told the audience: 'We have set down a timetable that is absolutely clear.

'That a command paper will be published by the end of October, that the heads of agreement between the parties and further devolution will come in November and that the draft legislation, the laws that will form the Scotland Bill and eventually the Scotland Act, will be ready by the end of January.

'If you like, by St Andrew's Day the heads of agreement, and by Burns Day the laws that we will then enact for the future of the country.'
