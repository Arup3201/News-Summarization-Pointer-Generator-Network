As a professional shooter, Rachel Carrie is used to travelling all over the world for competitions with her shotgun in tow.

But while competing in her native Britain at the Commonwealth Games she did not receive the usual warm welcome. Instead, the hotel she was staying at called the police.

The 30-year-old was forced to spend almost four hours being questioned over the firearm, despite producing a shotgun certificate and telling them she was part of Glasgow 2014.

The athlete has now complained to Malmaison hotel in Dundee for treating her ‘like a criminal’.

She said: ‘I got to the hotel at around 11pm ... first the staff asked me if I had brought a rifle onto the premises.

I replied no, it is a shotgun, and tried to explain my role in the Commonwealth Games.

‘But they said it was illegal to have a shotgun in a hotel. It is not illegal to have a shotgun in a hotel. 

'They called the police and I was questioned until 2.30am. I was really embarrassed.’

The shooter,
 from Leeds, had driven five hours to Dundee for the ladies’ double trap
 competition at the Barry Buddon shooting centre.

The event involves shooting two clay pigeons released from a trap simultaneously.

She
 said: ‘I have taken my Perazzi 12-gauge shotgun around the world, I 
have been to America and to most European countries and this has never 
happened before.’

Miss Carrie was staying in a different hotel to the Team England shooters, having been drafted in at the last minute as a ‘filler’ – who can shoot for any team which is unable to field the required number of competitors.

Miss Carrie, who models for luxury tweed brand Holland Cooper, said she is worried the lack of sleep affected her performance

Her shotgun was eventually taken to be stored at a police station.

The hotel’s general manager Josie Simcox confirmed yesterday: ‘We do not allow firearms in the guest bedrooms.’
