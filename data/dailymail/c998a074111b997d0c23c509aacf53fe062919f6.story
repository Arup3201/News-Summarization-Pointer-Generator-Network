The president of Germany today became the first leader from the country to visit a French 'ghost village' where Nazi soldiers murdered 642 civilians including 205 children.

The inhabitants of Oradour-sur-Glane, near Limoges, were massacred by the SS and all their homes and businesses were destroyed on June 10 1944.

In a sign of post-war unity, Joachim Gauck said he felt a ‘mixture of gratitude and humility’ as he visited the site with his French counterpart, Francois Hollande.

The statesman added: ‘The Germany that
 I have the honour of representing is a different Germany from the one 
that haunts memories.’

In 
return, Mr Hollande said: ‘You have made the choice to visit - this is a
 tribute to you, and at the same time it forces us, once the past has 
been acknowledged, to go boldly into the future.’

Mr
 Hollande and Mr Gauck were today accompanied by two of only three 
living survivors of the Oradour massacre - Robert Hebras, 88, and Jean-Marcel Darthout.

Mr Hebras, who was 19 at the time, hid under the corpses of others who were machine-gunned.

Here in this ghost town near Limoges, France, it is still June 10 1944 - the day it was stormed by the dreaded S.S.

Today Oradour exists as a massive memorial  - a chilling time capsule where the burned out homes remain exactly as they were on the day they were torched, and even the car of the mayor still lies rusting in the main street

'I was consumed by hatred and vengeance for a long time,' he said, adding that Mr Gauck's visit came at an opportune time.

'Any earlier would have been too soon. But now we must reconcile with the Germans.'

During the massacre, the men were 
rounded up and shot in barns, the women were herded into the local 
church which was set ablaze with hand grenades.

It is thought Oradour was destroyed because of resistance attacks on the division as it moved north.  But another theory is that the booty - massive amounts of gold - of Das Reich officers was stolen and they believed the peasants of the village had it

Veterans

 civilians on the Russian front - were moving up to the Normandy 
battlefields to try to counter the Allied invasion forces when they 
detoured into the sleepy hamlet which had existed for 1,000 years.

Ironically, many of the soldiers who 
took part in the massacre were from the Alsace region - the disputed 
borderland that has changed hands many times between France and Germany 
down the centuries.

Prosecutors
are still pondering whether to put on trial seven elderly 
members of the Das Reich division found alive in Germany.

A military tribunal opened in Bordeaux in 1953 to try the surviving 65 of the approximately 200 soldiers involved.

However, many could not be extradited from the new East Germany, and 14 of them were Alsatians – French nationals of German extraction.  Twenty were found guilty, but were all released from prison within five years
