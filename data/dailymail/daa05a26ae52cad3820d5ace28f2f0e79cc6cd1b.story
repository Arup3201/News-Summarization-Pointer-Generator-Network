Every bride wants their special day to be unique and give their guests a party they will always remember.

So one U.S. couple, Jacob and Natasha Jones, from Eagle Mountain, Utah, took the unusual step of hiring a huge human slingshot to catapult the blushing bride through the air at the reception.

Guests gathered outside the reception to watch Natasha -still wearing her wedding dress and a pair of cowboy boots -strapped into harness and fixed to an elasticated rope between two enormous poles.

The wings of love: Jacob and Natasha Jones were rocketed through the air by a massive slingshot on their wedding day

Stretched to the limit: Jacob rode the ATX that stretched the rope on the slingshot

Higher love: The bride is launched into the sky at high speed as guests look on

She then sat on the back of an ATX ridden by her new husband and was pulled back, stretching the rope.

She was then suddenly released and thrown through the air at high speed, as the crowd whooped and hollered at the bizarre yet joyous spectacle at the Hobble Creek Lodge in Springville,Â  Utah.

Natasha, who married Jacob earlier this month, even threw the bouquet to the crowd as she was bounced back and forth high above the laughing guests.

Catch: Ladies rush forward to get hold of the bouquet

To the victor go the spoils: A youngster snatched up the bouquet

It was eagerly snatched up by a young girl enjoying the celebrations.

Then it was her groom's turn to be thrown from the slingshot. As he soared through the air he waved his cowboy hat rodeo style, delighting guests.

Colton Spencer, who posted the video on Youtube, said: 'Now that's the way you throw a bouquet! Yeehaw! Congrats Jake and Natasha!'
