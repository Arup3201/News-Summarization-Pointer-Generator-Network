Iran successfully launched a live monkey into space last week, the government said today.

There is no independent confirmation of the achievement and there have been 
no announcements by Western powers of any Iranian launch late last week.

The monkey was said to have returned 'intact', an achievement the Iranians celebrated as an advance in a missile and space programme that has given the West and Israel cause for concern.

The monkey was put into what appeared to be a child's safety seat before entering the space shuttle

The monkey was said to have been sent up in a Kavoshgar rocket that climbed to a height of more than 75 miles before returning.

In 2011, President Mahmoud 
Ahmadinejad unveiled the space capsule designed to carry the live monkey 
into space but that attempt was reported to have failed.

At
 the time, Fazeli touted the launch of a large animal into space as the 
first step towards sending a man into space, which Tehran says is 
scheduled for 2020.

Iran sent small animals into space - a rat, turtles and worms - aboard its Kavoshgar-3 rocket in 2010.

Claims: Al-Alam said the monkey was 'alive' after travelling to an altitude of 75 miles for a sub-orbital flight as part of 'preparations for sending a man into space,' which is scheduled for 2020

Iran has sent small animals into space - a rat, turtles and worms - in 2010. In September, Iran suggested it may also launch Persian cats into space

Iran's decade-long space programme 
has raised alarms in the West because the same technology that allows 
missiles to launch satellites can be used to fire warheads.

Israel,
 the US and others claims that Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons
 but the country's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, denies that.

Tehran maintains that its nuclear work is nothing but peaceful.

Fruit
 flies were the first animals be sent into space when they were put on 
board a U.S.-launched V-2 rocket on February 20, 1947.

Two years later, Albert II, a Rhesus Monkey, became the first monkey to go into space.

The space race really gathered speed in November 1957 when Russia sent Laika the dog into orbit aboard the Soviet Sputnik 2 spacecraft.

Then, on January 31, 1961, Ham became the first chimpanzee launched into outer space as part of the NASA space programme.

One of over a 
dozen chimpanzees trained by the U.S. to beat the Soviet Union’s attempt
 to win the space race, Ham made history as the Cold 
War extended into orbit.

As
 the Russians moved closer to sending a human into space, the Americans 
decided to use three-year-old Ham — in a style reminiscent of a 
gas-detecting canary in a mine — to find out whether humans would be 
able to survive in such conditions.

Three chimpanzees Duane, Jim, and Chu eat snacks while strapped in their model space capsules. The chimps were among 75 being trained for space missions at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico on Jan 13, 1961

The most famous of all the 
chimps who were launched in Mercury space capsules that ultimately 
carried Alan Shepherd, the first American man into orbit, Ham was 
actually not named until after his January 1961 flight succeeded.

The
 name by which he’s now known — an acronym for Holloman Aerospace 
Medical Center at the Air Force base — was only used when he returned 
safely to earth.

This was because NASA reportedly wanted to avoid bad publicity should a named and therefore humanised animal be killed.

Originally
 from Cameroon in Africa, and once a star attraction for a Florida zoo, 
Ham was added to the astro-chimp team in the United States Air Force to 
go into space.

The difference between Ham and the Russian dogs, which were preferred by the Soviets because of their ability to sit still for longer periods, was that he would not only go up into space, but also come down again safely.
