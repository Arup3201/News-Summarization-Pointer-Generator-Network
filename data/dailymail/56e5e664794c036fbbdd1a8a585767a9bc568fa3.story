A Conservative MP was today ordered to pay compensation to her best friend after sacking her from her constituency office.

Penelope Nurick was awarded a payout after Claire Perry, MP for Devizes, let her go in a ‘staff reshuffle’.

Mrs Nurick backed Mrs Perry to stand for the Tory party before she won the seat in 2010, and worked in her office for two years.

Claire Perry, Tory MP for Devizes, was told to 
pay £1,296.68 to best friend Penelope Nurick after sacking her from her 
constituency office

But in February this year, she was sacked and replaced by another employee.

Despite being best friends, Mrs Nurick then started legal proceedings claiming she had been ‘unfairly dismissed’ Mrs Perry.

Today, judge Jenny Mulvaney ruled in her favour, and ordered the MP to pay her ex-secretary £1,296.88.

Mrs Perry, is the MP for Devizes and was elected during the 2010 General Election. She is pictured outside Number 10 handing in a petition requesting a block on pornographic websites.

Judge Mulvaney said there had been an ‘absence of consultation’ and there had been discussion about whether Mrs Nurick would be considered for the new job.

She said: ‘It was conceded by the respondent that the dismissal of the claimant by reason of redundancy was unfair and so I find. There was clearly an absence of consultation.

‘Although the respondent considered whether the claimant should be offered the role to which Mrs Reay was appointed, no discussion of that possibility took place with the claimant.

‘In addition no notice of the meeting at which she was informed of her redundancy was given and she was not informed of her right to be accompanied at that meeting.’

The judge said that if a ‘fair procedure’ had been followed and Mrs Nurick had been consulted there was a ‘100 per cent likelihood’ that she would have lost her job anyway.

The compensation of £1,296.88 reflected the length of time that Mrs Nurick’s employment might have been extended in order to enable a fair redundancy procedure.

Mrs Perry told the tribunal in Bristol that she was forced to fire her friend when senior advisor, Christopher Jones, left his job in November 2011.

The MP said she was unable to replace Mr Jones and so decided to split his extensive job role between her London and Devizes offices.

She hired Tamara Reay - who was able to cover both policy and ‘surgery only’ roles - in her Devizes office at the expense of Mrs Nurick.

Mrs Perry told the hearing: ‘It was clear from our early experiences that she [Mrs Nurick] would struggle with more responsibility.

‘The claimant required a lot of managing and support, particularly in the IT area and all of this led me to believed that this would not be something she would not be able to do, she would be incapable.

‘I could not afford to keep Mrs Nurick on doing a surgery only job and employ someone to do a local policy job. I found someone who could do both.’
