Prince Charles is to spearhead the Government’s war on drugs when he visits Colombia later this month.

The Foreign Office has asked the Prince and the Duchess of Cornwall to visit the South American country, one of the world’s largest producers of cocaine, to strengthen ‘co-operation in the fight against drugs and crime’ as well as expand trade links.

During his four-day stay Charles will discuss co-operation between drug agencies in Columbia and the UK with President Juan Manuel Santos Calderon.

Off to Mexico: Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall will visit Mexico and Colombia later this month

The Prince and the Duchess will then fly on to Mexico, where they will visit four cities and stop off at the Museo del Paste – or Pasty Museum – in Real del Monte, which celebrates the Cornish delicacy bought to the country in the 1820s by Cornish tin miners.  

Much of Mexico - and all of Colombia - will be new to Camilla who, despite having privately travelled to the area in the past, has never made an official trip.

The couple's visit comes at the request of the British Government, following invitations from President Calderon  and President Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico.

'The visit will be a major boost to the bilateral relationship between the UK and these two dynamic and influential nations in Latin America,' a spokeswoman said.

During the tour, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall will take part in a series of engagements, many of which touch on matters close to Charles' heart, among them youth unemployment and the environment.

Success: The visit comes in the wake of Prince Harry's Brazil tour which saw him get a hug from a policeman

Prince Popular: Harry proved a big hit with the locals as he toured Brazil and Chile on behalf of the UK

Well travelled: With the exception of Kate, all senior royals will have visited Latin America following the tour

Trade and investment will also be high on the agenda, as will combating domestic and sexual violence, with Camilla taking a leading role in the latter.

The couple will travel to Colombia first, arriving in Bogotá on the 28th October, and will get an official welcome from President Santos and his wife María Clemencia Rodríguez  at Casa de Narino, the following day.

Other engagements in Bogotá will focus on traditional arts and crafts, historical architecture, organic food and wool, trade and investment and a celebration of the British Council’s 75th anniversary.

They will also attend a peace and reconciliation ceremony to remember the victims of Colombia’s armed conflict, which still continues sporadically and has resulted in between 50,000 and 200,000 deaths.

Happy memories: Prince Charles sports a Mexican straw hat during his first visit to the country in 1966

Flying visit: Prince Charles' only visit to Colombia took place during his stint on HMS Minerva 

The Duchess will also attend a high-level meeting for charities and government representatives attempting to combat sexual violence - another appalling feature of the conflict.

Charles, meanwhile, will tour Macarena National Park in southern Colombia, before travelling to Cartagena with Camilla, where he is to deliver the concluding speech at the Health Of The Oceans international conference.

Charles and Camilla will end their visit to Colombia with a sunset ceremony on board HMS Argyll, which will be moored in Cartagena. 

The Prince, having been a naval officer on his last visit to Colombia in 1974, will take part in this ceremony in his role as the Admiral of the Fleet.

Happy return: The Prince of Wales returned to Mexico in 1970 before making a third trip to the country in 1993

Convivial: For his four-day tour in 1993, he was welcomed officially by then-president, Carlos Salinas

Excitement: Like  Harry in Brazil, Charles was greeted by excited crowds all over Mexico during his third visit

After waving goodbye to Colombia, the couple will travel on to Mexico, beginning with a visit to the town of Real del Monte, which has had close ties with Cornwall for more than 150 years.

Cornish miners arrived there from Falmouth in 1825 to help reinvigorate the Mexican silver mining industry.

But they didn't only bring mining techniques. As well as industrial skills, the miners brought the Cornish pasty and football with them - both of which remain enormously popular today.

Indeed, so close is the relationship between Real del Monte and Cornwall, it is twinned with the town of Redruth and boasts scores of civic ties.

Good time: On his most recent visit in 2002, Charles indulged in a game of pool with some of the local children

Wonderful experience: During his last tour, Charles also played football and visited a butterfly sanctuary

The couple's first day in Mexico is also the Day of the Dead, a public holiday when people gather to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died, and visit their graves.

Charles and Camilla will join the locals and mark the day by visiting the Cornish cemetery in Real del Monte, which contains the only known British First World War memorial in Mexico.

The memorial, which pays tribute to a Cornish immigrant who died at the Battle of the Somme, will also be the scene of a wreath-laying ceremony in which both Charles and Camilla will pay their respects.

Later, the couple will travel on to Mexico City, where they will receive an official welcome from President Enrique Peña Nieto and his wife Angélica Rivera at the presidential palace.

On tour together: Since becoming Duchess of Cornwall, Camilla has accompanied Charles on scores of visits

Busy: Along with UK visits such as this one to Whitby, the couple have visited Australia, Canada and Jordan

Romantic: They also visited the Ashkardham Temple in Delhi during last year's tour of India

Other events will include a reception at the historical Antiguo Colegio de San Ildefonso to announce the Year of the UK in Mexico and the Year of Mexico in the UK in 2015 - a programme designed to promote collaboration in the fields of education, science and innovation, culture, and business.

Later, in Campeche, the Prince and Duchess will visit the Edzna Maya archaeological site, which dates back to 400BC.

During their tour of the site, they will learn about the renaissance of the site and meet some of the workers who have helped to restore the ruins.

On their final stop in Monterrey, the business and industrial centre of northern Mexico, the couple will receive an official welcome by the Governor before undertaking a programme of events that will highlight the regeneration of the area’s historical sites.
