'Confused': Senior Labour figures have warned Ed Miliband to 'get a grip' or lose the next Election

Ed Miliband is being warned by senior Labour figures to ‘get a grip’ on his party or risk throwing away the party’s chances at the next Election.

Criticism of the Labour leader’s ‘slumbering’ summer performance was led by a senior frontbencher who told The Mail on Sunday it was ‘bonkers’.  

While Mr Miliband has been invisible for the past two weeks while on holiday in France, David Cameron has kept up an energetic schedule of media appearances.

Senior Shadow Ministers say Mr Miliband’s ‘confused’ leadership has left them unable to step into the breach – because they don’t know what line they should be taking.

And health spokesman Andy Burnham yesterday openly warned that Labour had to ‘shout louder’ or risk losing the Election.

Pro-Miliband figures then added to the rancour by briefing that Mr Burnham was ‘trying to save his job’ ahead of an expected reshuffle next month.

He is regarded as vulnerable because Labour has been unable to land blows on the Government over the NHS.

Mr Miliband returns to the UK this weekend with just five weeks until his crunch speech at the Labour conference.

The senior frontbencher who spoke to the MoS said that the party’s apparent decision to leave the field open to the Tories in the quiet summer weeks was astonishing.

The MP said: ‘It is completely bonkers. Everyone needs a break but we’ve had virtually no one in the Shadow Cabinet taking the fight to Cameron since the Commons rose for the summer holidays.

‘It’s very frustrating. And it’s going to make it that much harder when we come back for the party conference season.’

And a Labour backbencher called Mr Miliband’s approach ‘quite bizarre’.

He said: ‘Miliband appears to think he can make one big speech here and another a few weeks later, and that’ll do the job. It won’t. It’s almost a 1950s view of politics.’

The backbencher added: ‘No one has ever told me they’re voting Labour because of Miliband. They used to say they were voting for us because of our leader but that’s when we had Tony Blair.’

Another party figure added: ‘Ed Miliband’s team seem to have spent their entire time rowing over whether to hire a new spin doctor. Half of them have objected to the name they have in mind. That’s the sum total of their achievement.’

Labour MPs are deeply worried as their lead over the Tories has narrowed from an average of 11 points in March to five points in July. The party’s poll woes coincided with figures showing the economy returning to life – to the delight of No 10.

Doubts over Mr Miliband surfaced ten days ago when senior Labour backbencher George Mudie said his party looked ‘slightly hesitant and confused’ while the Coalition was ‘making the weather on welfare, health and education’.

However, backers of Mr Miliband last night dismissed the disquiet as ‘summer froth’. One said: ‘The fact remains that we’re still ahead of the Tories in the polls and there’s no prospect of Cameron winning a majority at the next Election.’
