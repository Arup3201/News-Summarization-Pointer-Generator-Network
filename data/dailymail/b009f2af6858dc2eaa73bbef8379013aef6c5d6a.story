Two former soldiers have been jailed for six years each for firebombing a mosque in the aftermath of Lee Rigby's murder.

Stuart Harness - who was once based at Woolwich Barracks - and Gavin Humphries were caught on camera throwing petrol bombs at an Islamic centre, having previously filmed themselves making the weapons on their own CCTV system.

They were jailed today at Hull Crown Court by judge Mark Bury, who criticised them for targeting 'law-abiding Muslims' in a misguided attempt at revenge for Rigby's death at the hands of Islamic terrorists.

Jailed: Harness, left, and Humphries, right, have each been sentenced to six years in prison

The pair admitted arson, while an accomplice, Daniel Cressy, was jailed for three years after being found guilty of aiding and abetting them.

'This was a crime of violence where a particular religious group was deliberately targeted in an act of retribution,' the judge said.

'This kind of attack cannot be tolerated. A severe sentence is required to punish but, more importantly, to deter.'

Mr Bury acknowledged the outrage felt over the killing of Lee Rigby by two extremists who were yesterday convicted of murder, but said that Harness, 34, and Humphries, 37, had gone the wrong way about expressing their anger.

Explosion: A judge criticised the pair for wrongly targeting 'law-abiding Muslims'

'Whatever your feelings of outrage were, you should have allowed justice to take its course,' he said. 'Instead you carried out a retaliatory act of throwing petrol bombs at the Grimsby Islamic Cultural Centre.

'As is usual in these cases, the victims had nothing to do with the events that so enraged you. They were entirely innocent law-abiding Muslims who were practising their religion in a peaceable way.'

The court heard how Harness and Humphries launched two petrol bombs each at the mosque in Grimsby on May 26 - four days after Fusilier Rigby was murdered.

They were spotted by police community support officers and followed back to Harness's nearby house where they were arrested.

Detectives found they had inadvertently filmed themselves bringing petrol into the house, building the bombs and leaving with them on a CCTV systems at Harness' home.

Red-handed: Harness apparently did not realise that he had left his own CCTV camera rolling

Accomplice: Daniel Cressey was jailed for three years for helping the pair carry out the attack

The CCTV footage, excerpts of which were played to Hull Crown Court, showed the whole process of making the bombs until they left in Cressey's car.

Jeremy Evans, prosecuting, said the bombs exploded outside the main doors of the mosque.

He said it was 'lucky' that the people remaining in the building were just on the other side of the doors and realised quickly what was happening.

They put out the flames despite being scared and there were no injuries and minimal damage.

The judge heard how both Harness and Humphries served in the Army with unblemished records.

Mr Evans told the court how Harness had been in the Army for 13 years and experienced 'active warfare' during deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan.

He said Harness had been based at Woolwich Barracks, where Rigby was also based and outside which he was hacked to death by Michael Adebowale and Michael Adebolajo.

Richard Hackfath, defending Humphries, said his client had also served in the Army with distinction, most notably as a close protection officer for senior officers.

He added that the defendant was not a racist, and had previously worked in Qatar teaching English to local Muslim children.

Charlotte Baines, for Harness, said her client apologied for his 'foolish, absurd and reckless behaviour' and said he was 'ashamed and disgusted' by what he had done.

Return: The camera also showed the moment when the attackers returned to the home afterwards

Blast: The explosion was so large it could even be seen by a camera in a nearby car park

Fury: The crime took place just four days after the killing of Lee Rigby in Woolwich

Cressey drove the other two men to the mosque but did not throw any of the bombs, the judge heard.

The judge said the offences were all religiously aggravated.

Speaking after the case concluded, a spokesman for the Grimsby Islamic Cultural Centre said: 'Our faith teaches us that in order to be perfect Muslims, we have to be model citizens of the area in which we live.

'It is with that aspiration that we want to move forward now and leave the events of May 26 behind.'

Det Sgt Stewart Watson, from the Serious Crime Team in Grimsby, said: 'We welcome the sentences handed to the three men.

'This was a very serious offence that could have resulted in people inside the mosque being fatally injured, thankfully nobody was inside at the time and only minimal damage was caused to the building.

'These three men took it upon themselves to react to incidents happening elsewhere in the country and retaliated by targeting the Islamic Centre.'
