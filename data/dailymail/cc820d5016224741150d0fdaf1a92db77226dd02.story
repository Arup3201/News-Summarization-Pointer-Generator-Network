Two movie-goers had to be treated by paramedics after they experienced adverse and shocking reactions to graphic scenes in a new horror film at the world-renowned Sundance Film Festival.

One viewer was watching a midnight screening of V/H/S last week when he ran from the cinema screen, collapsed and began to suffer seizures, according to the film’s co-writer Simon Barrett.

While he was being treated, his girlfriend also ran into the lobby and began to vomit. The night before, another woman reportedly left in tears because she could not stand the suspense.

Co-writer Simon Barrett admits that 'while very funny in parts, the film is also quite intense and gory'

The lurid accounts of movie-goers passing out will no doubt lead some to suspect that this may have been an attempt to court publicity - but the film's production team insist what happened was real.

Producer Roxanne Benjamin, posting on 
Twitter as the drama unfolded at the film festival in Park City, Utah, 
said they were forced to call ambulances and insisted it was a 'scary' experience.

'It was scary and not fun, and 
everyone is grateful the guy and his girlfriend are OK,’ she wrote. ‘And
 they wanted to go back in the theatre!

'One of the managers for the theatre 
was sitting near the guy, and said he just got real real pale and stood 
up and bobbed and weaved his way out the door.

'Once he was in the lobby, he kind of turned around and collapsed. He seemed to go into a seizure and so we called 911.'

Ms Benjamin said the two were treated for about half an hour, but did not need to go to hospital.

Speaking from the festival, Mr Barrett
 told MSNBC that the man became ill while watching a particularly 
'intense series of scenes' that include graphic injuries to a person.

He said it was not the first time that
 V/H/S had created such a reaction, adding that in a screening the night
 before during the same scene another young woman left the theatre in 
tears.

She spent the rest of the film in the 
lobby. The filmmakers spoke to her briefly and she told them 'I just got
 scared', but she didn't return to the theatre, Mr Barrett said.

Vertigo-inducing scenes: Like The Blair Witch Project, pictured, there is some shaky camera work in V/H/S

The film, acquired by Magnolia 
Pictures for more than $1million, follows a group of petty criminals 
looking for a VHS tape in a remote and rundown house, only to find a 
trove of recorded nastiness.

Like The Blair Witch Project, also a 
Sundance midnight movie that kicked off the genre in 1999, there are 
some vertigo-inducing moments of shaky camera work in V/H/S, 
particularly in the beginning.

The gang of criminals watch a variety of homemade VHS tapes containing supernatural moments.

At one point, a fleeing character 
tumbles down a flight of steps and gets a fracture in his wrist - the 
white bone jutting out through the skin as the predatory fiend appears 
at the top of the staircase.

Mr Barrett said that the segment, 
'while very funny in parts, is also quite intense and gory,' and noted 
that the film's handheld camera style and other factors 'can probably be
 a bit difficult to take'.

The Blair Witch Project by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez became a landmark film in horror movie history when it was released in 1999 to huge critical acclaim.

Audiences were left stunned by the realistic nature of the film, which left more to the imagination than most of its predecessors. It meant that less details provided more scares for viewers.

The 2007 release Paranormal Activity, directed by Oren Peli, featured a couple disturbed by a demon at night in their home, and it was acclaimed for its slow build up and horrifying ending.

It became the most profitable independent picture in cinema history thanks to a miniscule $15,000 budget and shocked audiences with its simple filmography rather than Hollywood special effects.

The Exorcist, a 1973 film directed by William Friedkin that still gets viewers running for the hills when they watch it over and over again, featured a child becoming possessed by a mysterious entity.

The movie was praised by horror fans for feeling claustrophobic and Entertainment Weekly labelled it as a ‘viscerally harrowing movie’ that is ‘so disturbing it will mess you up for months’.

And finally... The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 might not be one of the scariest films ever, but some movie-goers had seizures because of flashing lights in a controversial birth scene.

The fantasy film contains a series of red and white flashing lights during the scene when Kristen Stewart's character Bella gives birth to a baby girl that is half-human and half-vampire.
