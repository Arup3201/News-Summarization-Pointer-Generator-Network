Wesley Sneijder has revealed that he rejected the chance to join Manchester United in the summer 

The Dutch midfielder said that he needed to remain in the Champions League with Galatasaray 

He said: 'Louis (Van Gaal) is one of the most intelligent men in football - and I knew of Manchester United's interest in the summer.

'It was flattering - but I am very happy in Turkey - and it is very hard to leave Champions League football.'

Galatasaray face Arsenal in the Champions League on Wednesday and Sneijder says they will look to attack Arsene Wenger side's at the Emirates.

He added: 'Arsenal play some very good football - especially from midfield - so it important we can do all we can to stop them from playing their game.

'We are not trying just to stop their game - we can play very good football ourselves and want to take the game to Arsenal - we believe we can win.'
