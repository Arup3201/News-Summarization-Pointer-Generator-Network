The world champions are out. History. Kaput. Spain are gone. Tied first in departing this tournament, with Australia. Not in body, because there is still the matter of a meaningless final group game in Curitiba on Monday, but mathematically and in spirit. They trooped off the pitch in the Maracana Stadium last night, heads bowed, all resistance spent. After two games they have no points and a goal difference that reads 1-7. This truly is a seismic development for football.

It is the worst defence of a World Cup title in history, poorer even than Italy in South Africa four years ago. They, too, exited at the group stage, but at least their final game was live. Spain now travel Brazil a redundant embarrassment. Nobody wants to be one of those teams, the dead rubberers, fulfilling a fixture list simply because they must.

This will be the game that many say marks the end of the era of tiki-taka, too, but with that is raised a more existential question. Was there ever any such thing? Did tiki-taka create a great Spanish team, or was it merely itself the invention of 11 outstanding players.

Shock: The world champions are out of the 2014 World Cup after two consecutive defeats

Won't need these again: Iker Casillas throws his gloves to fans after a poor display at the Maracana

Great start: Eduardo Vargas celebrates after giving Chile the lead against Spain in the World Cup

Unconventional: Vargas fell to the floor while beating Iker Casillas in the Spanish net

Back of the net: The Real Madrid goalkeeper could do nothing about this goal

Blunder: But Casillas should have dealt with Charles Aranguiz's second for the Chileans better

Disappointing: Casillas only managed to claw away Alexis Sanchez's free-kick into the path of the goalscorer

Technique: Aranguiz's toe-punted effort found its way into the back of the net

Spain (4-2-3-1): Casillas 5, Azpilicueta 6, Martinez 5, Ramos 5, Alba 5.5; Busquets 5, Alonso 4 (Koke 46, 7); Silva 6, Iniesta 6, Pedro 4.5 (Cazorla 77, 5), Costa 4.5 (Torres 64).

Booked: Alonso.

Chile (3-4-1-2): Bravo 7; Medel 8, Silva 7, Jara 7; Isla 7, Aranguiz 7.5 (Gutierrez 64, 6), Diaz 7, Mena 7.5; Vidal 7.5 (Carmona 88); Vargas 7.5 (Valdivia 85), Sanchez 8.

Goals: Vargas 19, Aranguiz 43

Booked: Jara, Mena.

Referee: Mark Geiger (USA) 7.

And one in particular: Xavi Hernandez 
of Barcelona. We think systems make players, but perhaps it is the other
 way around. Holland have played great football since the era of Johann 
Cruyff, but has it ever again been total football?

And Spain will no 
doubt come again – but will it be with tiki-taka, or some new philosophy
 that simply suits their XI at the time. Diego Costa is most certainly 
not a disciple of tiki-taka. He is an old-fashioned target man, of the 
type that every English n club once had.

Xavi, meanwhile, was dropped 
for this game, having been partly responsible for the 5-1 defeat by 
Holland last week. In his absence, others tried to recreate Spain’s 
style, but without success. Xabi Alonso had a terrible time and was 
substituted after 45 minutes. They tried to tiki, they tried to taka, 
but without Xavi at his peak it just wasn’t the same.

Chile
 were, by contrast, magnificent. It would be wrong to say they played 
without a philosophy, because they were superbly organised, pressed high
 and upset Spain’s rhythm beautifully.

Yet there is no catchy name for 
what Chile do, no books that are written on its rise, no credit given 
for changing modern football as Spain have done with their three 
straight tournament wins.

Our time: The stadium rise to applaud Chile After a wonderful first-half performance

Jorge Sampaoli, an Argentinian, has simply got
 his team playing excellent, technical, hard-working football of the 
type that wins big matches, and maybe tournaments, too – unless the big 
guns of South America buck their ideas up here. Chile looked better than
 Argentina did at the Maracana on Sunday, and were an upgrade on either 
of Brazil’s two performances so far. They took their chances, defended 
manfully, ran to the point of exhaustion and showed great courage after 
half-time when Brazil threw the kitchen sink at them. It wasn’t always 
comfortable, but it certainly wasn’t fortunate. What happens now in the 
final game against Holland may depend on how keen either team is to 
avoid Brazil, who it is presumed will win Group A. If both teams go for 
the top spot in Group B on that presumption, it could be one of the 
matches of the tournament.

Fittingly,
 the Maracana is where this World Cup has found its truest, noisiest 
expression. Why Brazil have avoided coming here until the final, 
therefore, is a mystery. In their absence, the rest of the continent has
 taken residence – Chile raising the decibel level above even the 
crescendo of Argentina on Sunday. And that was before they took a two 
goal half-time lead against the world champions.

Spain
 had too much to lose, while Chile played like a team that could only be
 heroes. The exclusion of Xavi and defender Gerard Pique – but, 
fatefully, not goalkeeper Iker Casillas – spoke of the trauma suffered 
in the five goal defeat to Holland. Chile’s players, by contrast, spent 
the previous night socialising with friends and family at their 
beachfront hotel in Barra. It showed. In the second minute Gonzalo Jara 
headed an Alexis Sanchez corner just wide to roars of approval and the 
pattern was set. Chile were not in the least intimidated by this 
occasion. There were here to destroy some serious reputations.

 Incredible,
 really, considering two of their starting line-up might have been 
looking out for next season’s Championship fixtures earlier in the day, 
to see who they would be playing on the first day of the new season. 
Jara of Nottingham Forest is at home to Blackpool, Gary Medel of Cardiff
 City away at Blackburn Rovers. No wonder they played like men possessed
 in the Maracana. What a moment, what an opportunity, what a possible 
escape if they can grab the world’s attention here. They certainly did 
that last night. Rugged, committed, but highly skilled in attack, Chile 
matched Spain’s possession statistics in some periods of the match and 
stretched a beleaguered back four to breaking point.

Del
 Bosque had brought in Javi Martinez, a holding midfield player by 
nature, to the heart of defence, but he was hardly convincing. Alonso, 
equally, was finding it hard to get to grips with Chile’s movement as a 
defensive screen. Upfront, Spain fluffed their lines – none more so than
 the apple of Jose Mourinho’s eye, Diego Costa.

He
 had a good chance in the 27th minute, put through by a headed flick 
from David Silva, but buried the ball into the pitch and the 
side-netting. Indeed, the only time Chile’s goalkeeper Claudio Bravo was
 needed in the first-half was in the 15th minute when Spanish aggression
 forced a goalmouth scramble and he fell on an Alonso shot from close 
range, much like Superman smothering a grenade.

Unsuccessful: Javi Martinez could not inspire a stronger defensive performance

Unhappy return: Costa snubbed playing for Brazil in favour of starting for Spain in his home country

It
 was soon after this incident that Chile took the lead, by no means 
against the run of play. Alonso lost the ball and a swift counter 
attacking move saw Charles Aranguiz play a lovely square pass into the 
path of Eduardo Vargas.

He took a touch to control it and, at first, it 
appeared as if the delay was costly. In fact, he was merely moving the 
ball from his left to his right, and finished with a low shot that gave 
Casillas no chance.

In the
 44th minute, Chile went two clear. Sanchez curled in a free-kick which 
Casillas should have taken, but chose to parry instead – the ball flying
 tamely out to Aranguiz who swung a right foot and sent it on a return 
path to goal.

Form: Chile took another step closer to qualification after their impressive 2-0 win

The 
second-half followed a predictable pattern, Koke on for Alonso and Spain
 fighting for their lives. Even so, there was an excellent chance for 
Mauricio Isla in the 69th minute, when he almost got a foot on a 
crossfield shot by Eugenio Mena.

For Spain, Costa missed another fine 
chance, and then set an equally good one up for Sergio Busquets, with an
 overhead kick, which was scuffed wide.

We
 all know what event the Maracana is waiting for but, until that day 
arrives on July 13, it is hard to believe there will be bedlam louder 
than the final whistle here. Chile had torn down the temple of 
tiki-taka; or maybe Xavi Hernandez had just turned 34; or maybe a bit of
 both.
