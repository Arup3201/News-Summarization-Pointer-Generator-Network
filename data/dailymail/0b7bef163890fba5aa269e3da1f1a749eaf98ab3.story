A huge hump-backed 'ostrich' dinosaur, taller than a London bus and with arms eight feet (2.4 metres) long tipped with razor sharp claws, has been modelled based on Mongolia fossils.

Two almost complete skeletons - which included the remains of digested fish in the belly of one - have helped build an accurate picture of the lifestyle of mysterious Deinocheirus mirificusone.

For almost 50 years it was known only from two gigantic arms but the new collection of fossils  have now been pieced together.

Scientists had wondered about an odd dinosaure called Deinocheirus mirificusone for almost 50 years after discovering two of its huge arms. Now a pair of new skeletons unearthed in Mongolia have allowed them to assemble the missing pieces of the puzzle. Shown is a 3D model of the creature

Analyses indicate Deinocheirus was the largest member of the ornithomimosaurs - a group of dinosaurs that bore a superficial resemblance to modern ostriches, Dr Yuong-Nam Lee and colleagues report in Nature.

The  creature is estimated to have measured an incredible 36 feet (11 metres) long and stood over 16 feet (4.9 metres) tall, and it would have have weighed about 7 tons (6,350kg).

A giant salt water crocodile that lived 160 million years ago was as long as of a double-decker bus, scientists from the University of Edinburgh claim.

The terrifying creature roamed the ocean feasting on marine animals such as turtles and may even have eaten dinosaurs, according to a new study.

The fearsome prehistoric reptile measured more than 30 feet (nine metres) long.

Fresh research into Machimosaurus reveals key details of how and where it lived. Experts say three different species could be found in Europe and a fourth in Ethiopia. 

The skeletons, discovered in two different quarries in 2006 and 2009, shows that Deinhocheirus, roamed Earth 70 million years ago.

The 2006 specimen of Deinocheirus mirificus was found at quarry Altan Utul IV; the 2009 specimen at Bugiin Tsav. 

Both of these are quarries are in the Nemegt Formation in the Gobi desert, a rock unit dated to 70 million years ago.

The dinosaur has unique features not seen in other ornithomimosaurs, such as an elongated toothless snout flaring out at the sides and a humped back.

It also had an enormous lower jaw more like theropods such as T-Rex. 

Vertebrae from the two new specimens also showed long, flat neural spines jutted upwards from the middle of the dinosaur's back to create a sloping, bony hump.

No other ornithomimosaur has been found with such a structure, but other sorts of unrelated dinosaurs - such as the croc-snouted Spinosaurus and the shovel-billed Ouranosaurus - have been found with similar 'sails'.

Fleshy 'sails' could have helped dinosaurs regulate their body temperature but other scientists believe the bones supported something more like a bison's thick hump.

The researchers said Deinocheirus would have lived by rivers with a duck-like bill probably helping it forage for food at the bottom of streams. Blunt and flattened bones under its claws could have prevented it from sinking on wet ground.

Fish remains were found among what seems to be stomach contents but the Deinocheirus skeletons also have features associated with plant consumption - suggesting the creature was an omnivore.

Over a thousand small, polished stones were discovered around the belly region of one of the fossils. Dr Lee described these as gastroliths - or stomach stones - that the dinosaur intentionally swallowed to grind up tough plant material.

The strange beast was originally identified in 1965 from a couple of forelimbs eight feet (2.4m) in length - the record holder for the longest known arms of a bipedal animal. Its Latin name means 'unusual horrible hand.'

Dr Lee, of the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources in Daejeon said: 'These fossils provide new insights into the creatures and reveal unexpected features that could not have been predicted from the partial skeletons originally discovered in 1965.

'The discovery of the original specimen almost half a century ago suggested this was an unusual dinosaur - but did not prepare us for how distinctive Deinocheirus is - a true cautionary tale in predicting body forms from partial skeletons even for animals in which the relationships are known.'
