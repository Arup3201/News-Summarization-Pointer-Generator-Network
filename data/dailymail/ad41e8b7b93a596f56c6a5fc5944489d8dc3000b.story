AZCentral reports that rescuers gave him CPR but he died on the beach.

Wife Mikki Eveloff, who was present on the beach when her husband began to struggle, said he was in excellent health but may have had a heart attack. 

'It was such a tragedy,' she told AZCentral. 'But it's also a blessing, as he wanted us all to be together.

'He was the most selfless, loving, kind, considerate, giving man I 
had ever met. It's beyond the imagination -- thousands of people have 
paid tribute to him. He touched everybody's life.'

A 'Celebration of Life' in his memory is planned for Sept. 21 at the Camelback Inn in Phoenix, though details have yet to be announced.

'I can't imagine going anywhere else. Greg would treat you like 
family. He didn't try and sell you anything, he wanted to make sure he 
looked good,' college friend Brad Gilbertson told reporters. 'He was a workaholic. That store was his life. He was 
kind and generous and warm.'

Eveloff started at The Clotherie '35 years ago as a sales associate' but eventually rose to ownership, according to the company's Web site.

Under his leadership, the company has consistently impressed men's fashion experts, having been named a Best of Class men's shop by Esquire.

Wife Mikki said that while her husband's sudden death is tragic she was grateful to be with him when it happened

'Don’t stress over the airline losing your bags again, you’ll look better when you leave the Clotherie than if they hadn’t,' Esquire advised Phoenix visitors.

The cause of death has yet to be determined.

Eveloff's company released the following statement upon learning of his death:

'We are so incredibly sad to let everyone know that yesterday we lost
 one of the greatest men, friends, and overall inspirations that has 
touched this earth. We know that there are so many people that have 
either met him once or known him for many of years and we thank you for 
sharing in his life. He loved everyone as if they were family and was 
touched by the great times, the sad times, and simply loving being part 
of everyone's experiences.'
