Lions prop Adam Jones has become the latest Welsh player to commit his future to the Aviva Premiership after agreeing to join Harlequins for at least two years.

The 34-year-old, who has been capped 100 times, retired from international rugby in January and will bring a wealth of experience to the Quins front row.

He joins a healthy contingent of Welshmen plying their trade in England. Rhys Priestland has signed for Bath, while Jamie Roberts and Taulupe Faletau could join the likes of George North, James Hook and Bradley Davies.

Jones said: ‘I’m really excited about this new challenge. Harlequins are an ambitious and progressive club with good values. Everyone who is there, or who has been there, loves it.’

The south-west London club are planning to recruit heavily this summer, with former Australia skipper James Horwill already signed up and Scotland wing Tim Visser in talks.

In Jones, Quins have one of the most popular figures in Welsh rugby, although he has been involved in a stand-off with Wales coach Warren Gatland. 

There have been calls for the veteran to come out of retirement to cover a lengthy front-row injury list, despite being in the twilight of his career.

Harlequins director of rugby Conor O’Shea said: ‘Not only is it apparent that Adam wants to keep going for some time to come. But the work he will do in supporting and pushing our young tightheads, Kyle Sinckler, Will Collier and Matt Shields, will benefit us for years. He is a world-class prop and we cannot wait to get him involved. I am sure he will become an instant hit.’
