India captain MS Dhoni could play the first Test against Australia as he attempts to overcome a left fractured thumb before the start of the delayed series.

Dhoni, like his hamstring-injured Australian counterpart Michael Clarke, would have missed the originally scheduled first test in Brisbane. But the death of Australia batsman Phillip Hughes forced a rescheduling of the test series, with Adelaide now hosting the opener at the Adelaide Oval starting Tuesday and the Brisbane test set for a week later.

Dhoni flew into Adelaide on Saturday and will train with his team-mates on Sunday.

Both teams are switching their focus back to the series after the death of Hughes, who died last Thursday two days after being struck by a ball while batting in a domestic match in Sydney.

'We are professional cricketers, we have to move on,' Indian paceman Ishant Sharma said Saturday. 'What has happened is really bad and everyone was really shocked (we) need to look forward to what is coming next for us and that is what we will do.'

His team-mate Rohit Sharma said the first test would be welcomed by a mourning cricket world.

'It was a very sad incident but cricket has to go on, the game will go on,' he said Saturday. 'Mentally, everyone is focused to do well. When you go out on the park, the only thing is about how to perform and give your best. That incident of Phil Hughes will definitely be in everyone's minds but when it comes to this game, we all be focused on how to do well and get the best result.'
