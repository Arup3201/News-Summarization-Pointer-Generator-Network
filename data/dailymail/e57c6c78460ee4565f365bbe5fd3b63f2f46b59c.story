Tottenham defender Danny Rose has been spared an uncomfortable reunion with the man who racially abused him two years ago.

Rose has not travelled to Serbia ahead of Thursday's Europa League opener against Partizan Belgrade.

It means Rose will avoid the prospect of going face-to-face with Partizan midfielder Nikola Ninkovic.

Rose was racially abused by Partizan Belgrade's Serbian midfielder Nikola Ninkovic (L) on U 21 duty in 2012

Ninkovic was handed a 12-month international ban for making racist gestures towards the England defender

The Serbian FA handed Ninkovic, who was 17 at the time, a 12 month international ban for making racial gestures during a clash against England Under-21 in October 2012.

Rose was incensed at his treatment during the time of the incident and questioned whether he would ever return to the country to play again.

The clash against Partizan was due to be his first return to Serbia since the incident, but manager Mauricio Pochettino has taken the decision to leave Rose back in England.

The Spurs chief, however, insists the decision not to include the left-back in his squad has nothing to do with that unsavoury night.

Striker Emmanuel Adebayor has also been rested, despite the manager claiming the competition is a priority

‘No, it’s not for that reason that he did not come,’ said Pochettino.

‘It is because he finished the game at Sunderland and felt a bit tired. I know about the problems two years ago but they are not the reason he is not here now.

‘We know the situation but it is not the reason. He didn’t ask to be left out. The decision was based on football only. All my selection decisions are based on football always.

‘I think two years is a long time. My decision was simply to give him a rest because down to him being tired after Sunderland. Before that he was with the national team for two weeks.’

Rose, who is expected to be available for Sunday’s clash against West Brom, isn’t the only first-teamer to be left behind with Emmanuel Adebayor, Younes Kaboul, Moussa Dembele and Nacer Chadli also missing Thursday's clash.

Pochettino is adamant, however, that the Europa League remains a priority despite his decision to rest a number of his stars.

‘We have a strong squad and we need to choose the best players and those in the best condition to play,’ said the Argentine.

‘We decide not bring those players for different reasons but the Europa League is a priority for us. All competitions are priorities for us.

‘This year it is very important because the Europa League gives you the possibility to play in the next Champions League.’

Meanwhile, Pochettino has defended his decision to make Younes Kaboul new club captain following the departure of Michael Dawson.

Some supporters, who feel the Frenchman is too injury-prone to be skipper, have taken to social media to criticise the decision.

But Pochettino added: ‘I don’t take a decision for the feeling from outside the club. Always I take a decision always with my reason and from my point of view to provide to the squad and the club the better condition.

‘If we pick Kaboul or Adebayor it is because we have information from inside that this is better for the squad.

‘Maybe not everyone is happy with all my decisions. But in the end I am the manager and I need to choose.’
