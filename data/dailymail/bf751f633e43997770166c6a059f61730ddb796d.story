Samir Nasri is clearly doing his best to party away Les Bleus as he and girlfriend Anara Atanes attend a post-birthday bash while on holiday in Los Angeles.

The Manchester City star celebrated his 27th birthday on Saturday while his French team-mates prepare for their last 16 World Cup match against Nigeria.Â 

Atanes took to social media to post a picture of the pair and a friend as she wrote 'Day Party #LABaby.'

Nasri was controversially snubbed from France's World Cup squad, after manager Deschamps claimed the midfielder didn't take well to sitting on the bench.

What happened next, though, was even more controversial as Atanes took to Twitter to launch a foul-mouthed rant against Deschamps and the France team.

She posted: 'F*** france and f*** Deschamps! What a s*** manager!'

To reiterate her point further, the 
British model then tweeted: 'Incase u didnt read my tweet properly.... 
Ill repeat myself..... f*** FRANCE!!!!! And f*** Deschamps!'

Atanes has since set her account to private after it caused a stir with Deschamps, who immediately threatened legal action.
