It is known as a breeding ground for the biggest names in American comedy.

But some of the best slipped through the net.

The rejects of Saturday Night Live include Jim Carrey, Kevin Hart, Zach Galifianakis, and Steve Carrell.

In something of an apology to those who were rejected but later made it, some of the best audition clips were broadcast during the 40th anniversary episode.

Bounced back: Zach Galifianakis didn't get a role in 1999 (left) but became a writer for SNL (right, on Sunday)

Pete Davidson introduced the reel with the words: 'Here's a look back at the auditions of some people Lorne hired - and a few he maybe should have.'

The segment featured the 1992 audition of comedy chat show host Stephen Colbert, who failed to make the cut. 

Jim Carrey can be seen walloping around the set in an energetic sketch that failed to win over associate producer Jean Doumanian in 1980.

And Kevin Hart, who was sidelined after an audition in 2013, also earned a spot in the reel.

Didn't make it: John Goodman, who has since hosted the show 13 times, lost out to Joe Piscopo in 1980

Other comedians who didn't make the cut but succeeded later include Friends star Lisa Kudrow - who is credited with transforming female comedy. 

She was shown the door after losing out to Julia Sweeney.

Kathy Griffin was in the same audition, and later said she thinks the producers made the right choice with Sweeney.

Steve Carell auditioned with his then-fiancée - later wife - Nancy Walls in 1995. Walls was cast, but Carell lost out to Will Ferrell.

John Goodman, who has since hosted the show 13 times, lost out to Joe Piscopo in 1980. 

Zach Galifianakis did not land a role in 1999 but was taken on as a writer - before his career rocketed.

Louis C.K. was the only one to be turned away when he went to audition for SNL in 1993 with Dave Attell, Laura Kightlinger, Sarah Silverman, and Jay Mohr.
