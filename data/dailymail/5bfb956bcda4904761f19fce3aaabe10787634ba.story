What a pair of cheeky monkeys! The two young rhesus macaques get a clip round the ear from their mum after a playtime wrestling game gets out of hand.

The boisterous duo were playfully grappling together but as things got out of hand and fur began to fly the young primates' mother stepped in to calm things down.

Although not before the youngsters had demonstrated some kung-fu moves on each other at Silver River State Park in Florida.

The boisterous duo were having fun grappling with each other under the careful watch of their parents but fur began to fly as their competitiveness went overboard and they began brawling

What started off as a wrestling playtime went too far and when fur began to fly their mother stepped in to calm things down

The hilarious moment was captured by Scottish photographer Graham McGeorge while on a trip to the wilderness preserve two weeks ago.

Graham, who now lives in Jacksonville, Florida, said: 'The two young monkeys were playing and wrestling each other - but at some points it actually looked more like martial arts.

'We stopped to observe them twice and each time they were chasing each other around for about 20 minutes.

'They didn't seem to get tired - it looked like this was the norm and they could go all day long.

'The images were taken from a pontoon boat on the river. We would drop anchor at a safe distance and just observe the troupes behaviour.'

After playtime was over both of the young siblings seemed more subdued

The images were taken from a pontoon boat on the river so the troupe's behaviour could be observed without disturbing them
