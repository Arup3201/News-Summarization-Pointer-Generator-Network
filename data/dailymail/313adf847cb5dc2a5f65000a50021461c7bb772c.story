Relief: Maryam Hassan leaves Southwark Crown Court today after being found not 
guilty of assaulting actress Tara Reid and racially aggravated 
harassment

A former model accused of glassing American Pie actress Tara Reid in the face wept hysterically as she was cleared today.

Maryam Hassan, 27, allegedly assaulted the Hollywood star after spotting her chatting to former Holland international Edgar Davids at Beat members-only club.

The West End haunt is popular with footballers and celebrities including teen heart-throb Justin Bieber.

The American pin-up was rushed to hospital after suffering a corneal abrasion which required a consultation with a plastic surgeon following the 'ugly' incident, Southwark Crown Court heard.

Ms Reid also received a cut to her forehead and an injury to the bridge of her nose.

But Hassan - a friend of West Ham player Carlton Cole - was unanimously cleared of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

She was also acquitted of racially abusing a bouncer at the club.

The jury of six women and six men reached its verdicts after four hours and four minutes of deliberation.

Casually
 dressed in a black blouse, tight black jeans and ballet pumps with a 
cat motif, with her dark blonde hair scraped into a top knot, Hassan 
sobbed hysterically as the verdicts were announced.

She shouted 'thank you' at the jury before hugging a friend who had been seated in the public gallery.

Hassan refused to comment outside court.

Ms
 Reid had enjoyed a birthday meal of lobster and champagne at swanky 
restaurant and private members club, Annabel's, in Mayfair, prior to 
arriving at Beat on November 8 last year.

In

noticed a female who kept approaching the table a few times.

'I
 didn't know who she was but I guess she was not getting any attention. 
She came up to me and threw the contents of her drink over my chest.

'I reacted immediately and threw my drink over her. The club's body guard took her away.

'The same female came back 20 minutes later and she was then taken away.

'She said "I'm not getting kicked out, you whore, you slut".'

The actress told how she 'could not open my eyes' after the incident.

Ms Reid claimed that Hassan 'went crazy, she went psycho like Naomi Campbell.'

'It was so quick, she stood close to me within arms' length, and smashed the glass in my face.'

Giving
 evidence Hassan, who graduated with a degree in political sciences from
 the University of Sunderland, said the glass flew out of her hand as 
she was manhandled by door staff.

Hassan
 admitted calling bouncer Zimzan Lelo a 'w******' but denied using 
racist language, because she is of mixed race heritage and her husband 
is black.

In a character witness statement, England striker Carlton Cole said he was 'honoured to call her a friend'.

Hassan
 had struck up a friendship with the star 12 years ago after she worked 
on charity projects for the Carlton Cole Foundation, which helps 
underprivileged children in war-torn Sierra Leone.

The footballer said Hassan 'had shown herself to be of consistent character with a good moral standing'.

Hassan,
 of Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, was acquitted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm
 and racially aggravated intentional harassment, alarm or distress.
