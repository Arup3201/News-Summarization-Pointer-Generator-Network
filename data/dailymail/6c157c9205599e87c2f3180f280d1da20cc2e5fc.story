A Virginia dad has massacred his family on Father's Day - shooting dead his wife, his 9-year-old step-daughter and a 2-year-old son in his crib before turning the gun on himself, police say.

Police say Barry C. Jernigan, a 35-year-old electrician, called his employer and made disturbing and suicidal comments before the shooting Sunday night. The employer called officers, who arrived at the home in Chesterfield, Virginia, outside Richmond, in time to heard gunfire inside, but too late to save the family.

Officers say Jernigan shot dead his 30-year-old wife Renotta, her daughter from a previous relationship Alexis Kellas, 9, and the couple's son Seth, 2, before committing suicide.

Neighbors described heroically running toward the sound of gunfire in the quiet neighborhood and finding toddler Seth dying of a gunshot wound in his bloody crib.

Gary Nguyen, a retired U.S. Marine, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch he and a nurse pulled the child out and performed CPR. The little boy died after being rush to the hospital.

Barry Jernigan and Alexis were found inside the small, white, ranch-style home with a plastic play set on the front porch and trampoline in the backyard. They and the mother died at the scene.

A police spokeswoman Elizabeth Caroon told MailOnline Barry Jernigan legally owned the gun he used used in the shootings.

Police had never been called to the house for domestic violence reports. However, court records show Jernigan was found guilty in 1999 of reckless driving and involuntary manslaughter. The details of that case were not immediately clear.

On Monday morning, neighbors tried to cope with the tragedy while standing near the house with two cars in the driveway that was surrounded by yellow police tape.

'It saddens me to think, Father's Day, of all days.You go home and shoot your kids, really?' said next-door neighbor Cindy Nguyen, 29, whose husband tried to save Renotta and little Seth.

Mrs Nguyen said Renotta had stumbled out of the front door Sunday before collapsing on the lawn.

Nguyen said that she didn't know the family too well but that the father worked nights, 'seemed fine,' and typically made small talk with neighbors since the Jernigans moved into the home about two years ago.

Neighbors say they had no indication that anything was wrong on Sunday - Jernigan even wished them a happy Father's Day

Barry Jernigan even wished her husband, 30-year-old Harry, a happy Father's Day as he walked along the street Sunday afternoon. The Jernigans recently installed a fence after complaining about items being stolen from their backyard, she said.

Nguyen called the youngest of the victims a 'sweet baby boy' and said her son played with the 9-year-old, who was known by her nickname, Lexi.

Jernigan's 67-year-old father, Barry, said he last spoke with his son - who went by Chris - on the phone shortly after 1pm Sunday. He said his son wished him a happy Father's Day and told him he planned to hang around the house until he left for work that evening.

While he had helped the family financially, Mr Jernigan said his son didn't talk to him much about family business, adding that he had been in and out of jobs since graduating from Dinwiddie High School in 1997.

'He was the type of person that he figured he could do everything ...  he could deal with it. Over the years, that was his attitude,' Mr Jernigan said. 'I just wish he would have called me.'

Jernigan said he couldn't understand what would've led his son to kill his family and then himself, saying he sounded normal when they last spoke.

'I don't know why he took that little baby, that little baby was the world to me,' he said. 'Seems like something you'd seen on TV, you'd never think it would happen personally.'

Police continued their investigation Monday, with investigators carrying paper bags out of the home. Officers on the scene declined to comment.
