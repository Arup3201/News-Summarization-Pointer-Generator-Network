Jo and Peter Fancourt are seeing red – a lot of red – as they celebrate their ruby wedding anniversary with an extraordinary road trip across the UK.

To mark the momentous occasion, the Jersey couple is touring 40 places with ‘red’ in their names.

Redcar on Teesside and Redesdale in Northumberland are two of the stops on their 3,000-mile journey in a car covered in red ribbons.

The romantics started their 'red trip' with a ferry ride to Weymouth, where they originally met.

From there, they have visited places in South Wales and all over England.

Mr Fancourt said: ‘Every day is a red day. We wake up and say, “What red clothes can we wear today?”’

In the last few days they have visited Red Marshall in Stockton and Redworth and Redford in County Durham.

They plan to visit Red Row, Redesdale Camp and Redesmouth in Northumberland before heading to Redburn, Red Dial and Red Main in Cumbria. 

They are also hoping to stop in Redmire in Yorkshire, Redbourne in Lincolnshire and Redmile in Leicestershire, before heading south to relevant places in Suffolk, Sussex and Wiltshire.

The Fancourts are having fun with the trip, even though some of the destinations are not very picturesque.

Mr Fancourt said: ‘One place, The Reddings in Gloucester, was actually a council estate.’

Before embarking on the road trip, the couple celebrated their anniversary with a trip to the Red River in northern Vietnam.

It is not the first time the couple has gone on an unusual adventure.

They have been house-swapping in the US and hostelling around Japan, and they have travelled by train to Siberia and Outer Mongolia.
