Pound-for-pound king Floyd Mayweather was out and about in Los Angeles again on Tuesday night as he took in another basketball match.

The 37-year-old was joined by his latest love interest model Liza Hernandez as he watched the LA Lakers beat the Sacramento Kings at the Staples Center.

Some late-game heroics from Lakers' Kobe Bryant saw the LA-based side wipe out a double-digit deficit as they pipped the Kings 98-95.

It was the second basketball match Mayweather had attended in as many days after he was spotted at an LA Clippers game on Monday with another female companion.

The undefeated boxer last fought in September when he defeated Marcos Maidana for a second time this year to take his record to 47 without loss.

Mayweather's next fight could happen in May 2015 and a potential blockbuster bout with Manny Pacquiao is on the cards.

But Brit Amir Khan, who fights Devon Alexander in Las Vegas on Saturday night, also wants to set up a fight with Mayweather before the American retires.
