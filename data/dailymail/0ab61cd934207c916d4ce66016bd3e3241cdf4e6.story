Geoffrey Counsell, 50, from Somerset, will face magistrates in Bristol next month charged with manslaughter over a road accident on the M5

Seven people died and 51 were injured in the collision between 34 vehicles on the northbound carriageway

Counsell was operating a fireworks display at the nearby Taunton Rugby Club at the time of the smash on the northbound carriageway.

Avon and Somerset Police and the Crown Prosecution Service, said in a joint statement: 'Since the collision we have worked closely together to thoroughly investigate the circumstances of the collision and to carefully consider all the evidence.

'Having considered the evidence in line with the Code for Crown Prosecutors, the CPS decided there was sufficient evidence to charge Geoffrey Counsell, the provider of the fireworks display at Taunton Rugby Club on the night of the collision, with manslaughter.

'The charges are due to his failings in the planning and operation of the display.

'It was clear from the investigation carried out by Avon and Somerset Police that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute for driver error and therefore no action will be taken against any motorists.

'The CPS also considered the culpability of Taunton Rugby Club and reached the conclusion that there is insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.'Counsell will face magistrates on November 12.Lorry drivers Terry Brice, from Patchway, south Gloucestershire, and Kye Thomas, from Gunnislake, Cornwall, died in the crash.

Father and daughter Michael and Maggie Barton, from Windsor, Berkshire, grandparents Anthony and Pamela Adams, from Newport, south Wales, and battle re-enactor Malcolm Beacham, from Woolavington, near Bridgwater, were also killed in the pile-up.Among those badly injured in the crash was Emma Barton, 19, who woke from a five-day coma to discover she had been orphaned.

Her wheelchair-bound father Michael, 67, and 30-year-old sister Maggie died.

An earlier version of this article stated that Geoffrey Counsell operated the fireworks display at Bridgwater Carnival.  We are happy to clarify that this was not the case and the display took place at Taunton Rugby Club and was not in any way connected with Bridgwater Carnival. 

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
