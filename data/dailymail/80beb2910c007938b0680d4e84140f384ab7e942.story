The editor of the Oscar-winning Muppets movie was a sexist who singled out female staff for abuse and told one woman she should not be a working mother, according to claims in a new lawsuit.

The film's assistant editor Cecilia Hyoun is suing Disney after she was fired from the 2011 blockbuster, and insists she was forced out because of the sexist atmosphere on set.

Her lawsuit singles out editor James Thomas, claiming he repeatedly grilled Ms Hyoun on her family life and referred to a female colleague as a 'c***'.

Ms Hyoun this week filed papers with a court in Los Angeles seeking compensation for her firing, which came in June 2011.

In the documents, she complained that producers 'treated [her] differently because she was an Asian woman over age 40, and terminated [her] employment because of her gender, race and family responsibilities'.

The mother of two's specific complaints were mostly directed at Mr Thomas, a British editor who has previously worked on Sacha Baron Cohen's films such as Borat and Bruno.

Mr Thomas, who is named as a defendant in Ms Hyoun's lawsuit, allegedly 'frequently interrogated [her] about her personal life and family situation', as well as making racially charged comments.

The documents went on to claim that the editor spoke about other women working on the film in derogatory terms, and described one senior female colleague as a 'c***'.

Soon before Ms Hyoun was fired, according to the court documents, Mr Thomas 'grilled [her] repeatedly about choosing between her family responsibilities and her work, telling her to decide between "being a mom" and working'.

Although the assistant editor insisted she was dedicated to her work, she was sacked from the film just weeks later.

Ms Hyoun said she was told that her job was now redundant, but claimed that a less qualified man was quickly hired in her place.

In the legal papers, she said she was 'fearful of being blackballed for standing up to a major studio', but was seeking damages because the circumstances of her firing had prevented her from finding work ever since.

She also claimed to have suffered 'pain and suffering, extreme and severe mental anguish and emotional distress' over the alleged sexism.

Disney and Mr Thomas have so far declined to comment publicly on the allegations against them.

Ms Hyoung previously worked on Hollywood blockbusters such as Almost Famous, 8 Mile and Vanilla Sky.

The Muppets was not the first time she had worked under Mr Thomas - the pair also collaborated on 2010 comedy Hot Tub Time Machine.
