More than 300,000 people crammed into London's Trafalgar Square today to celebrate Gay Pride - and catch bearded lady Conchita Wurst's first major UK concert.

The Austrian drag queen, crowned the winner of this year's Eurovision Song Contest, was introduced by Sir Ian McKellen at 5pm to conclude a day of celebrations for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community.

The day started with a huge parade featuring more than 20,000 people - up 25 per cent on last year's 15,000.

diversity.

The campaign is

 so many freedoms and yet suddenly all sorts of weird issues are coming 
up.

'These issues include transphobia or the idea that camp people are somehow betraying the gay community... and I just feel like, actually, no!

'There's room for everyone. I just think you've got to let a diverse community be diverse.'

The bearded lady shot to fame after landing 290 points for her performance of Rise Like A Phoenix in the Copenhagen-based competition.

Having already performed at a number of other countries' Pride events, she takes to the London stage alongside singers Samantha Fox and Sinitta.

'Let us be proud about who we are and let us give a statement for love, respect and tolerance.

'And most of all let us be proud and think about those LGBT people around the world, who can't make a Gay Pride in their countries.'

Michael Salter, Chair of Pride in London, said: 'Pride in London is not just a celebration of our capital's brilliant diversity.

'It is also an opportunity to acknowledge how much we have achieved whilst also recognising there is still much work to do to win true freedom for everyone - not just in London, but around the world.

'Our new campaign is about making sure that everyone has a chance to tell their story and be part of the celebration and campaigning of Pride in London.'
