Wicked Campervans have continued to fuel the fire surrounding criticism of their controversial slogans and explicit artwork, after they responded with a tongue in cheek interview saying: 'things are much more fun once they've been banned'.

The company came into the limelight earlier this week when Sydney mum Paula Orbea launched an online petition with change.org, asking the founder John Webb to 'eliminate misogynistic and degrading slogans and imagery' from their vehicles after her daughter sighted a Wicked Campervan with the phrase 'In every princess, there's a little slut who wants to try it just once'.

In an interview with SBS, Leanne Webb from Wicked Campers, formerly known as Liam, feigned surprise when asked about the company's slogans.

Leanne Webb from Wicked Campers, said the company was not concerned with the criticism it has received over the last few days regarding its controversial slogans and artwork

'Controversial? Really? I mean, I don't know - we don't try to be controversial. We never try to be controversial, it's not our goal. We just do what we love and we try to have fun,' Leanne said.

'We poke fun at everything more broadly, it's never specifically targeted at anyone in particular at all.'

The budget hire company, which has depots around the world, said they were not phased at the bad publicity, despite the online petition currently having over 100,000 signatures.

'We're not worried at all that it will affect business in any way,' Ms Webb told SBS. 'We think it's fantastic, things are much more fun once they've been banned.'

The slogan that the 11-year-old daughter of Paula Orbea told her about which led her to start a petition calling for the elimination of 'misogynistic and degrading slogans and imagery' from the vehicles

A litany of complaints have been leveled with the Advertising Standards Bureau against Wicked Campervans for its use of advertising slogans

When describing how the slogans were thought up, Leanne continue to joke around.

'We come up with all of the designs - everyone in the company after many many hours... of drinking water,' she said.

SBS also reported that Mr Webb said he was not concerned about the petition, saying it was providing his company with global marketing.

Despite taking the bad press in good humour, the fate of the company and their slogans is up in the air, with the Queensland Parliament discussing banning the vans altogether.

Promoted as 'budget' travel for tourists looking to road trip through parts of Australia, the hire vans offer travellers fully-functional eat, sleep and drive capabilities.

This is perhaps one of the less controversial slogans posted on the rear of a the Wicked Campervan

The company offers budget campervan rentals popular with tourists opting to take road trips along Australia's east coast

There are packages, specials and different sizes and varieties of vans available. Some have slogans while some come without.

The company was approached for comment about a litany of complaints leveled against it via the Advertising Standards Bureau, but so far has not returned calls. A foreigner working for the company said Mr Webb was not available on Sunday.

Daily Mail Australia counted some 60 complaints - either dismissed or upheld - against the company's use of slogans - including one which was dismissed that read: 'To all virgins: Thanks for nothing.'
