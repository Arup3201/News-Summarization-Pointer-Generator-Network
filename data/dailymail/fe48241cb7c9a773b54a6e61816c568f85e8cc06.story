Former Russian spy Anna Chapman is launching her own fashion brand, it was revealed yesterday.  

The 31 year old redhead - once married to a British man - launched her line of 'casual clothes' at a show in the Turkish resort of Antalya.

Moscow's most glamorous secret agent hired talented young designers from Russian fashion colleges, said a spokesman for Fondservisbank, her main employer.

Fashionable: The range includes dresses and women's handbags that are said to resemble books by famous radically-minded Russian writers

Launched at the Dosso Dossi Fashion show 2014, she wanted to produce clothes 'you could wear anywhere, from a big city to a backwater village', it was reported.

'Reporters and fashion magazines' buyers from all over the world will have a chance to see the first women's clothing collection by Anna Chapman,' said the spokesman.

Her fashion range includes women's handbags resembling books by famous radically-minded Russian writers, it is understood.  

One is a mock-up of the book 'Who is to Blame?' by Alexander Herzen, a 19th century writer and thinker known as the father of Russian socialism.

Designs: The former secret agent's interest in a clothes brand began three years ago

Another is modelled on Nikolay Nekrasov's 'Who can be Happy and Free in Russia?'.  

A third features revolutionary democrat Nikolay Chernyshevsky's 'What is to be Done?'

The brand will be called Anna Chapman - the surname she took when she wed British former public schoolboy Alex Chapman who she met on a trip to London.  

The daughter of an alleged KGB officer, the flame haired agent was busted by New York police in 2010 on accusations of being part of a network of sleeper agents.  

She was deported in a Cold War-style spy swap along with nine others, and was then greeted by Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin who took part in a patriotic sing-song with her.  

Since her return to Russia, Chapman has dabbled in politics, taken part in risque photoshoots for men's magazines, and hosts  a TV show about the mysteries of the world.

Inspiration: A spokesman for the company said she wanted a Russian dress that would 'please her soul'

Her interest in a clothes brand 'all began three years and three months ago when Anna returned to Motherland after jail in a prison shirt,' said a statement.  

'She disliked these alien clothes and Anna went on  to search for a Russian dress that would please her soul. She kept looking for it but did not find'

She was previously reported to be interested in designing new uniforms for Russian cosmonauts, though the project failed to materialise.

In July she hit the headlines with a Twitter proposal to wed  American whistleblower Edward Snowden, who was at the time stranded in a Moscow airport.

The femme fatale walked out of an  interview on US television when she was questioned about the proposal.  

'I'm not going to discuss this,' she told  NBC's Richard Engel. 'OK, the interview is finished. I'm sorry.'

She explained: 'I'm a very private, discreet person and I still don't do many interviews because I just don't like to share.

'I don't believe that people would be interested in knowing about somebody's life.'

Opinion: The designs are 'unimaginative and poorly constructed'

While the concept of a spy-created fashion label is intriguing, Anna Chapman’s designs are unimaginative and poorly constructed.

In the three photos provided to MailOnline, Ms Chapman’s work displays serious execution issues including rippled hemlines and skewed seams.

If Ms Chapman wanted to impress with a novelty clothing line worth looking at, she would have created the kinds of sharply tailored separates that viewers of shows like Homeland and Scandal have come to associate with fashionable spies.

Our fascination with fictitious, beautiful spies would have provided Ms Chapman with a vast demographic to sell her goods.

But instead she has created conservative cotton-candy dresses that look like Disney Princess Halloween costumes – for the bible-toting set.

A long, blue A-line dress – worn on a blonde model posing in an antiquated library – looks like a less magical version the dress Aurora wears to prick her finger in Sleeping Beauty.

Its improperly-fitted bodice and twisted hem highlight the design’s likely cheap, synthetic fabric.

Adding to the fairytale attempt is a book clutch design that mimics the signature miniaudieres of French label Olympia le Tan.

But Ms Chapman’s book clutch does not boast the same handcrafted intelligence as the Olympia le Tan originals she tries to emulate. It’s brown velvet cover and machine-processed embroidery negates the concept’s overall charm.
