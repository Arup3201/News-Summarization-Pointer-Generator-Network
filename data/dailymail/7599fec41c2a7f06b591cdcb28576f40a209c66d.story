A South Carolina couple suspected in the mysterious disappearance of the husband's former lover have now been charged with murdering her.

Sidney and Tammy Moorer kept their heads down as they appeared in court in Conway, South Carolina on Monday - three days after authorities searched the couple's home and found evidence giving them probable cause to charge the Moorers with killing 20-year-old student Heather Elvis.

Horry County Police Chief Saundra Rhodes said that authorities have not yet found Elvis' body but continue to carry out investigations. Elvis' family have spoken of their hope she will be found alive.

The couple, who have three children, were arrested on Friday on indecent exposure and obstructing justice charges. Kidnapping and murder charges were added at Monday's court appearance.

Elvis, a cosmetology student, vanished on December 18 after she drove her car - willingly, authorities believe - to a boat landing building in Myrtle Beach. It was found empty on December 19.

Cell phone records show Sidney Moorer, 38, was in contact with Miss Elvis at 6am on the day she disappeared.

In
 the original police report, seen by WMBF News, Miss Elvis was said to 
have been in a relationship with Moorer, who she had met while 
working in a restaurant.

Her
 roommate had told police the affair had handed about a month before 
Miss Elvis disappeared, and that on the night she went missing, the pair
 were back in contact. 

The roommate allegedly said Miss Elvis told her Moorer had called to say he was leaving his wife so he could be with her.

A December 19 police report 
included a statement from Sidney Moorer admitting he had been in contact
 with Miss Elvis, to tell her to 'quit calling him and that was it'.

Mystery: Heather, 20, disappeared in December after driving herself to a boat landing in South Carolina

Where is she? Elvis drove to Peachtree Landing, pictured, on December 18 and her empty car was found there the next day. Authorities have not found her body but said they believe she has been murdered

The
 couple's home was searched Friday morning by police who, Lieutenant 
Robert Kegler said, had a search warrant after analyzing video 
surveillance.

On
 the night Miss Elvis disappeared, she had been on a date with a man who
 dropped her off at the apartment at about 2am. That man has been ruled 
out of the investigation.

Police
 believe Miss Elvis later drove herself to the boat landing where her 
car was found, although the reason she would go there is not known.

Sidney Moorer's attorney T. Kirk Truslow said the case is a rush to judgment.

'Sidney
 has no connection to, nor knowledge of, any facts surrounding the 
disappearance of Heather Elvis,' Truslow said in a statement. 'I firmly 
believe Sidney will be completely exonerated.'

Tammy Moorer's attorney added that she will be cleared.

'To
 the best of my knowledge, Tammy does not know Heather Elvis at all,' 
defense attorney Greg McCollum said. 'I don't think they've ever met.'

Elvis' family said they didn't care about the new charges - only what had happened to their daughter.

'If Heather is safe and unharmed, I don't
 care what they do to them,' Terry Elvis, her father, told ABC News. 'They can turn [the Moorers] 
loose. I really don't care.'

As details about the arrest became 
known, members of the 300-strong search party who have been looking for 
Miss Elvis lined the street outside the Moorer property.

The
 group has been tirelessly searching for the young woman, combing the 
surrounding woodland and boat landing, since she disappeared.

On a Facebook page dedicated to the search, the Elvis family posted a statement on Friday, calling on residents to keep searching.

'Please
 be aware that there are rumors flying everywhere that Heather has been 
found. This is not the case,' the post said. 'Please keep your flyers 
and posters up and on display till Heather is home.'

Charged: Tammy and Sidney Moorer, who had an affair with student Heather Elvis before she vanished in December, were arrested on Friday and on Sunday, new charges were added

Arrested: Sidney and Tammy Moorer have been charged with obstructing justice and indecent exposure

Trial: Sidney and Tammy Moorer are being held on $20,000 bond each

Terry Elvis, Heather's father, had 
previously released the last picture he had received of his daughter, 
which showed her learning to drive a stick shift on her date. 

Mr Elvis explained in an essay on xoJane
 that he has a manual transmission truck he had been saving to give to 
one of his daughters, but that neither of them had ever learned how to 
drive a stick shift.

At the 
end of her date the night before she disappeared, the man she was 
meeting offered to teach her how to drive his manual truck  in a mall 
parking lot and she excitingly sent the picture of her driving to her 
father to share the accomplishment.

'It is the last communication I have had with my daughter, the last picture I have of her on my phone,' Mr Elvis said.

'I didn't talk to Heather about it, but she had a good time,' Mr Elvis added about the date. 'I didn't think much of it.'

Mr Elvis has worked tirelessly in the police investigation and search for his daughter.

 her father the night before she vanished

Search: Terry Elvis prints missing person posters for his daughter as the family continue their search

In his essay, Mr Elvis wrote that his daughter's disappearance had taught him not to take his loved ones for granted since you never know when you might lose them.

'Hold your loved ones close, tell them how much you love them every day. Never let them doubt how much love you have for them so that if you are ever in the position I am in, you will be able to look in the mirror with less regret,' Mr Elvis said.

The family still hope Miss Elvis will be found alive.
