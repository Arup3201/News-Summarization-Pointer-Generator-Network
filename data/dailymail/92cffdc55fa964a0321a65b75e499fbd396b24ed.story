The family of a boy from New Mexico has filed a lawsuit against a police officer who they say used his Taser gun on the 10-year-old as punishment for refusing to clean his patrol car during a school career day.

A photo of the victim's chest that was released on Saturday shows what appear to be bruises resembling cigarette burns from the Taser's prongs that pierced his chest.

The alleged victim, identified only as R.D., passed out after receiving a 50,000-volt jolt of electricity while attending the event at Tularosa Intermediate School in May.

The lawsuit was filed on October 26 by the boy's court-appointed guardian against officer Chris Webb, who has been charged with battery, failure to render emergency medical care, unreasonable seizure and excessive force.

According to the court filing, on May 4, police officers drove onto the school campus, where Webb asked a group of boys which one of them would like to clean his vehicle, ABC News reported.

R.D. raised his hand and jokingly said that he did not want to clean the car.

In response, the suit claims that Webb leveled his Taser at the child before saying: 'Let me show you what happens to people who do not listen to the police.' He then allegedly stunned R.D.

Attorney Shannon Kennedy who represents the boy’s family said that instead of calling paramedics who were on campus for the career day, Webb pulled the barbs from the Taser out of the boy’s chest.

‘He grabbed the wires, he yanked them and it came out of the prongs, and then he went up to me and he ripped the prongs out of my chest,’ R.D. told ABC News in September.

The boy said the officer then took him to the restroom to clean up and then to the nurses office.

‘R.D.’s mother arrived at the school in absolute shock and rushed him to the emergency room,’ said Kennedy.

In the aftermath of the incident, the attorney said R.D. is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.

‘He wakes up in the middle of the night holding his chest afraid his heart will stop,’ said Kennedy. ‘He says, “Mommy I’m afraid I’ll never wake up again.”’

However, a police report filed by Webb tells an entirely different story.  

According to the document, Webb said a group of students had asked him to show them his Taser gun, and when he pulled it out, it accidentally went off and hit the 10-year-old in the chest.

Webb stated in the report that he immediately shut off the power switch, removed the cartridge and threw the stun gun to the ground.

Both the New Mexico Department of Public Safety and Webb are being sued, with R.D.’s guardian looking for punitive damages for battery, failure to arrange emergency medical care, excessive force, negligent hiring, training, supervision and retention and unreasonable seizure.

'No reasonable officer confronting a situation where the need for force is at its lowest, on a playground with elementary age children, would have deployed the Taser in so reckless a manner as to cause physical and psychological injury,’ Higgins said.
