Happy little Vegemites who love the iconic Aussie spread, just not the teaspoons of salt that comes with it, will now be even happier.... or healthier.... with the new version.

The overhaul of the brown yeasty concoction will now contain far less salt, 25 per cent to be exact, catering for the more health conscious Vegemite lovers.

With demand high for healthier products on supermarket shelves, the makers of the 91 year old savoury condiment decided to come up with a specially formulated Vegemite.

Much healthier?: The new less sodium recipe has more than a teaspoon less on salt than the original blend

Vegemite on toast : while the new less salt spread is a step in the right direction the Hart Foundation says the product still contains too much salt

And the low sodium spread is said to contain almost a teaspoon and a half less salt.

Modelez Australia (foods) who owns the iconic treat says many Australians are consciously reducing their salt intake for health and wellbeing reasons.

They believe older Australians and parents wishing to choose lower salt options for the family will welcome the reduced salt version into their pantries.

'Inspired by requests from around the country, our research and development team here in Port Melbourne, we have created a variety of Australia’s favourite breakfast spread that even more Aussies can enjoy,' said general manager marketing of foods, Mike Waddington.

'We know that Australians don’t want to compromise on the Vegemite taste, and with Reduced Salt, they won’t have to.' 

So what's the verdict? Is it just as good as it's older brother.

A few taste testers told Nine news, 'tastes the same, tastes the same.'

'Pretty good. And the unusual comment, 'tastes like chinese medicine.'

So it is really that healthy? Kellie-Ann Jolly, Cardiovascular Health Director, at the Heart Foundation says offering a reduced salt option for such an iconic product is a great step forward, but it remains a high salt product.

'The Heart Foundation encourages all companies to look to reducing the unnecessary salt in their products,' she said.

'Eating too much salt in the long term can increase your risk of high blood pressure, which is a risk factor for heart disease, Australia’s number one killer.'

Happy little Vegemites : the low sodium option contains about more than a teaspoon less of salt than the original blend

there's no denying the popular Aussie spread has been a favourite with many for years. The Heart Foundation says about one teaspoon of this salt reduced Vegemite on one slice of bread provides about 40 per cent adequate intake for a one to three year old

'We know that Aussie kids are eating more salt than they need to. If there is no action to improve our children’s food habits we are setting them up for a high chance of heart disease later in life.'

'About three quarters of the salt we eat comes from everyday supermarket foods rather than salt added at the table,' she said.

Ms Jolly says about one teaspoon of this salt reduced Vegemite on one slice of bread provides about 40 per cent adequate intake for a one to three year old and about 30 per cent for a four to eight year old. 

Invented in 1922 by Melbourne's Dr. Cyril Callister, the brand is now owned by American company Mondelēz International.

The inventor's grandson, Jamie Callister, told Nine news he's not so sure he'd be so pleased with the changes.

The original : Vegemite has been around for more than 90 years and has become an iconic popular spread but now there's a new version for the more health conscious

Melbourne's Dr. Cyril Callister invented the popular spread which has been loved by many Aussies for over nine decades

'I think he'd be pleased that they'd tried to do the right thing but I think in all honesty, you don't much with something that is tried and true and we all love it,' he said. 

In the past Vegemite hasn't always had a great reputation for launching new products.

In 2009, Kraft brought in a spread combining Vegemite and cream cheese which had considerably less salt and a milder taste to the original.

To coincide with the new recipe they ran a competition to give the new flavour a name and it was announced as isnack 2.0, hoping to appeal to the younger market.

But the choice instantly drew plenty of criticism and ridicule and only four days after its announcement plans were made to abandon the name, Kraft admitting it may have been a mistake.

They later called it 'cheesymite'. 

The new healthier product has 25% less salt than the original blend and is now hitting the shelves across Australia

The good old original blend : Vegemite is one of the world's richest known sources of vitamin B

We're happy little Vegemites as bright as bright can be : one of the iconic advertisements of the brand

Vegemite is one of the world’s richest known sources of B vitamins, with each serve containing 50 per cent of the recommended dietary intake of Thiamine (B1) and Folate (B9) and 25 per cent of Riboflavin (B2) and Niacin (B3).

Reduced Salt VEGEMITE is fortified with additional vitamins, including B6 and B12. 

Vitamins B6 and B12 are necessary for metabolism, supporting the immune system and brain function.
