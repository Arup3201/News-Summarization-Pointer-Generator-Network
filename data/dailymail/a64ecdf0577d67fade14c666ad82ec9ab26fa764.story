A student tragically drowned in a city centre river just weeks after posting a Facebook message to his girlfriend about his 'best year ever'.

Christopher Taylor, 21, was spotted in the River Avon in Bath at around 4.10am last Thursday, and officers quickly arrived at the scene.

They called out to Christopher, but he was swept under the water.

Christopher Taylor died in the River Avon in Bath in the early hours of January 23

A search was launched with trained divers, and the body of the talented young sportsman was pulled from the swollen river a few hours later.

Avon and Somerset police said: 'Police officers attended and were able to communicate with the man but were unable to get him out before he went under the water again.'

Chris, who was studying Chemistry at the University of Bath, and was a keen tennis player, had posted a Facebook message just weeks before his death about having the 'best year ever' with his girlfriend Jessica Palmer, 20.

He wrote: 'Well, that’s 2013 done and dusted...and as gay as it sounds, I’ve had the best year ever with my Jessica Palmer...I love you.'

Chris also posted happy pictures of himself in a tuxedo with Jessica in front of a Christmas tree and more pictures of themselves on a weekend trip to Bristol.

His grieving family, from Southport, Lancashire, paid tribute to him as 'a wonderful son and brother'.

They said: 'Chris was a talented sportsman who lit up every room he walked into.

The River Avon in Bath has been the scene of a number of tragic deaths

'His death has left us completely devastated.'

Mr
 Taylor’s death is the fourth river fatality in the city in recent years
 following those of University of Bath student Kharunigan Jayanatham, 
graphic designer Casper Flagg and Bath Spa University student James 
Bubear.

Last year, an 850-yard fence was installed along a stretch of the river to improve water safety.

The fencing was one of the recommendations of a safety review carried out following the tragedies.

An inquest will be held.
