Labour rounded on more than 100 of Britain's top business leaders today after they backed the Conservatives' economic plan and urged voters not to risk a 'change of course'.

In a highly unusual intervention just weeks from the general election, the business chiefs claimed a Labour government would 'put the recovery at risk'.

But Ed Miliband said the letter was not a surprise and only showed that the Tories were on the side of 'a few big firms and individuals at the top'. 

Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, meanwhile, dismissed the signatories as a 'cosy little club', while Labour peer John Precott went further criticising them as 'tax dodgers, Tory voters and non-doms'.

David Cameron, however, insisted the intervention was 'unprecedented' and claimed it sent a 'very powerful message'.

The business chiefs who signed the letter run companies with well known retail brands such as Primark, Iceland, Ladbrokes and Costa Coffee.

Executives at consumer brands such as Cobra beer, Britvic, Silver Spoon, Kingsmill, Thorntons, Robinsons, Tango and London Pride are also on the list.

Embarrassingly for Labour, the list of business chiefs includes several who supported the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.

However, Mr Miliband said the letter only served to expose the choice at the election. He said: 'Businesses have come out today to say they want lower business taxes and, you know, that doesn't surprise me.

'But it does also go to the wider choice at this election. The Conservatives really believe that if all of the few corporations and individuals at the top are doing well, the wealth will magically trickle down for everybody else.

'We have tried that experiment over the last few years and it hasn't worked. We have seen falling living standards and falling wages and insecurity at work. I just have a different view about the way the country succeeds.'

Mr Umunna went further dismissed it as a 'letter organised by the Conservative Party in a Conservative-supporting newspaper' after it was first published in the Daily Telegraph.

But Mr Cameron, touring Marston's brewery in the Wolverhampton today, said the letter from business leaders was 'very powerful'.

Mr Cameron said the letter from business leaders was 'very powerful' while the Chancellor claimed it was 'unprecedented'

Tory officials said the number of signatories to the open letter (above) made it 'unprecedented' in the history of British general elections 

He said: 'Today it is an unprecedented intervention by some of the business leaders in the best-known business, large and small, in our country saying the Conservative long-term plan is working, generating jobs.

'That is a very clear message from business leaders who, like me, care about jobs and wealth creation and prosperity and livelihoods in our country.'

Chancellor George Osborne added: 'The warning from Britain's business leaders couldn't be clearer: a change of course will threaten jobs, deter investment, send a negative signal about our country and put the recovery at risk.'

Deputy PM Nick Clegg said the letter was a tribute to the work of the Coalition government, and claimed an outright Tory win would ‘pose a very real threat’ to Britain’s stability.

The Lib Dem leader said yesterday: ‘I read the letter carefully, it talks about what this coalition government has done, and I think the signatories to the letter are completely right in saying that about the last thing that this country needs, now that we’re emerging from this long shadow of the economic crash in 2008, is a great lurch in one direction or another.'

However, the Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said the signatories were 'not exactly representative' of the business community and should 'be careful what they wish for', accusing some of signing up 'naively' to a Tory stunt. 

The business leaders were particularly positive about Mr Osborne's strategy of seeking to encourage investment by slashing corporation tax, which fell to 20 per cent this week, having stood at 28 per cent when the Government came to power in 2010.

'David Cameron and George Osborne's flagship policy of progressively lowering corporation tax to 20 per cent has been very important in showing the UK is open for business. It has been a key part of their economic plan,' the business leaders said in the letter.

'The result is that Britain grew faster than any other major economy last year and businesses like ours have created over 1.85million new jobs.' The list of signatories includes senior executives of nine FTSE 100 companies. It includes senior figures such as Peter Grauer, chairman of Bloomberg.

The list includes five signatories who previously supported New Labour including Sir Charles Dunstone, chairman of Dixons Carphone and Talk Talk, who signed a letter backing the party before the 2005 election. 

Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne, who unveiled a 'seaside manifesto' with Gordon Brown before the 2010 general election, is also a signatory.

Former Marks & Spencer chief Stuart Rose warned last night the Labour's plan to raise corporation tax would 'choke off the recovery'.

Ed Balls yesterday confirmed Labour will raise corporation tax for the first time in 40 years, despite warnings it could cost more than 100,000 jobs.

The cash will be used to fund a £400 cut in business rates for smaller firms.

But Lord Rose said: 'The more I hear from Labour, the more concerned I become. They don't get business.

'Labour talk a lot about spending money – but what about earning it? Ed Miliband and Ed Balls seem intent on pitting small businesses against large businesses, saddling the engine rooms of our country with higher corporation taxes and crippling entrepreneurs – all of which would choke off the recovery.'
