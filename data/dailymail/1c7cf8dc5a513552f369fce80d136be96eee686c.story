A collection of costumes belonging to Action Man - the British toy figure version of US 'movable fighting man' GI Joe - is set to get collectors very excited indeed.

The son of a retired toy rep was 'flabbergasted' when he heard that a rare Judo Outfit set he found in his father's loft could raise £20,000 at auction.

For decades Doug Carpenter, 88, has kept boxes of pristine toys in his garage and attic, little realising there are collectors who will pay a fortune for the unpackaged toys from the 1960s and 1970s.

Paul Carpenter, the son of a retired toy rep, was 'flabbergasted' when he heard that an Action Man Judo Outfit set (above) he found in his father's loft could raise £20,000 at auction. The judo item is so rare, it does not even feature in a specialist book of accessories

For decades Doug Carpenter, 88, has kept boxes of pristine toy accessories in his garage and attic, little realising there are collectors who will pay a fortune for the unpackaged toys from the 1960s and 1970s

Some of the forgotten gems will be sold off by toy specialists Vectis in Thornaby, Teesside in May or June. Above, a cataloguer from Vectis holds the 'Holy Grail' judo item

Even the ageing original cardboard box packaging is valuable to enthusiasts. 

The collection features clothing for a Battle of Britain pilot, Royal Hussar, Commando and Deep Sea Diver. But alas, there are none of the 12inch figures themselves in the set.

Mr Carpenter and his wife Daphne have handed the hoard to their son Paul and some of the forgotten gems will be sold off by toy specialists Vectis in Thornaby, Teesside in May or June.

Paul Carpenter, 51, who owns a dental lab, said: 'He worked for Palitoy as a sales rep through the 1970s to the mid 80s. He put pieces in the loft and in storage and it has all been forgotten about.'

That was until his parents asked him to help clear the space, and he found the boxes of untouched toys.

The pick of the find was a perfectly packaged Action Man judo suit so rare it does not even feature in a specialist book of the soldier's accessories.

More collectors are looking for Action Man toys as the people who played with them reach back to their childhood. It was based on the US action toy GI Joe

As the sporting range did not sell well compared with military outfits - probably as children preferred to keep Action Man soldiering - ironically those are the lines most sought after by collectors now, due to their rarity

There are also boxed football kits for Everton, West Ham, Spurs and Liverpool among others, an Action Man cricket set and racing cars.

As the sporting range did not sell well compared with military outfits - probably as children preferred to keep Action Man soldiering - ironically those are the lines most sought after by collectors now, due to their rarity.

Mr Carpenter, who has a brother, said: 'I am flabbergasted that this is worth anything like this amount.

'We played with these and we found a case of ours and they were all ripped to bits. We would have played with most of them. We had lots of friends coming round to play.

'To be honest, we didn't really appreciate it at the time. It was only later on we realised how lucky we were having all these toys to play with.'

The pristine boxed judo set dates back to 1969 or 1970 - and such is its rarity, experts cannot even be sure when it was first produced.

1964: GI Joe action figures introduced in US by toy firm Hasbro, generating huge sales.

1966: Action Man launched in UK by Palitoy - a simple copy of GI Joe produced under licence.

1968: Action Man sportsman range launched, including footballer and cricketer. 

Talking military commander Action Man issues spoken commands when string in back is pulled.

1970: Palitoy develops distinct figures for UK market, initially with British / German World War II uniforms. Distinctive fuzzy 'flock hair' introduced, along with beards.

1973: Gripping rubber hands appear - a major improvement as earlier figures could barely hold weapons. 

Each figure sold with special thimble to protect delicate rubber fingers during dressing and undressing. 

Famous accessories include Scorpion tank, jeep, helicopter, motorbike and sidecar, inflatable boat with electric motor.

1976: Eagle Eyes make first appearance. Small switch in back of head allows Action Man to glance left and right in faintly sinister style.

1979: Built-in blue underpants introduced, finally concealing Action Man's puzzlingly gender-free nether regions. New 'sharpshooter head position' allows more realistic fighting poses.

1980: New direction, as 'Captain Zargon the Space Pirate' and 'ROM the Robot' introduced. They fail to halt sales slump.

1984: Action Man is discontinued.

1996: New range of fantasy-style Action Man appears, with no connection to real military.

2006: Production of familiar figures ceased. 

Action Man brand name then attached to Hasbro's 'ATOM' range - smaller plastic fantasy figures, with no visible sign of Action Man pedigree.

More collectors are looking for Action Man toys as the people who played with them reach back to their childhood.

Vectis auction house hit the headlines when it sold a Boba Fett Star Wars figure last month for £18,000 belonging to superfan Craig Stevens.

Valuer Kathy Taylor went to collect the rep's toys which now fill a wall of the auction warehouse. 

It took two trips with a white van to collect all the items.

Paul Carpenter, 51, who owns a dental lab, said: '[My father] worked for Palitoy as a sales rep through the 1970s to the mid 80s. He put pieces in the loft and in storage and it has all been forgotten about'

She said: 'There has been considerable interest already and a fever is building up for it.'

Even small Action Man accessories, such as the tiny medals he wore, can be collectable.

She said: 'The bits and pieces are in short supply as they tended to go missing when they got sucked up by the vacuum cleaner.

'A lot of the value is down to the packaging. They are very scarce in shop stock condition.

'These are very unusual in that they have come out of trade boxes, so they are shop stock.'

But she felt there may be other perfect examples out there in lofts and cupboards that have not been opened for more than 40 years.

'Maybe somebody bought it for a present and never gave it - there are still things out there,' she said.
