Salt Lake City saw true heroism Thursday night when a group of courageous bystanders rushed heedlessly waist deep into a river to save three teenage boys trapped in an overturned SUV.

Police said the vehicle went airborne and landed in the water after crashing through a barrier while going too fast on Indiana Avenue at approximately 6:30 p.m.

Eyewitness Leo Montoya Jr. says he was the first into the water.

Salt Lake City saw true heroism Thursday night when a group of courageous bystanders rushed heedlessly waist deep into a river to save three teenage boys trapped in an overturned SUV

Police said the vehicle went airborne and landed in the water after crashing through a barrier while going too fast on Indiana Avenue at approximately 6:30 p.m

'I heard a long screeching, wrecking sound, and then a very loud boom,' he told NBC 12. 'I just went and got there as quick as I could'

As Montoya slogged through the current to the upside down GMC Yukon he found himself being followed by almost a dozen other men.

Upon reaching the car Montoya discovered three boys were still inside.

'We have to get this vehicle on all four wheels, immediately,' Montoya remembers shouting. 'Now! Now! Now!'

The response was captured on video by witness Adelana Mookie Oneal who posted the video to her Facebook page.Â 

In the footage, Oneal can be heard yelling for men to make their way down to the vehicle then exclaim in joy as the group manages to flip the SUV right side up.

The Deseret News reports that the driver, not named, had been underwater for roughly five minutes.

Firefighters were able to remove the driver and other unidentified boys from the wreck.

The driver was taken to the hospital in serious condition and the other boys, condition unknown, were also sent for medical treatment.

One of the men who helped to flip the vehicle said the group tried to cut apart the driver's seat belt before resorting to turning the vehicle over but that those attempts were unsuccessful.

'Everybody was yelling to jump in the water, and it just started snowballing,' Ron Darro said. 'More and more people were in the water.'

Faced with the footage after the fact, Montoya looked as if he was about to cry.

'As far as I know, a couple of kids get to live because of my actions,' 
Montoya told NBC 12, the glimmer of a grin breaking. 'I feel like I'm somebody.'
