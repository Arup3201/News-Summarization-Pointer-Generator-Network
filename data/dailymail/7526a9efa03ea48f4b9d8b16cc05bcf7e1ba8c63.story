Councils are pursuing poll tax cheats who voted for the first time in two decades in Scotland's independence referendum.

Officials have been ordered to comb the electoral roll to catch non-payers who dropped off the radar before re-registering ahead of September 18.

Scots still owe more than £300million on the controversial Community Charge, introduced north of the Border by Margaret Thatcher in 1989 - one year before England.

Councils are pursuing poll tax cheats who voted for the first time in two decades in Scotland's independence referendum

The historic vote on Scotland's future saw a surge in registrations, with 120,000 in the final six weeks alone, as people formed unprecedented queues outside town halls.

By September 18, 97 per cent of people aged 16 and over had registered.

Council chiefs believe some were returning to the electoral roll for the first time in a quarter of a century, after dropping off in a bid to avoid paying poll tax.

Councillor Willie Young, of Aberdeen, said: 'For the last number of years we have been looking to see how we can claw back poll tax arrears.

We've still got approximately £1.8million to recover. The referendum gives us an opportunity to see how much money is due and how we can pursue it.' Councillor Jim Gifford, leader of Aberdeenshire Council, said officers were already scrutinising the updated voters' roll to see if records tallied up with their own books.

'If they don't, we will go after them for that money,' he said. 'We don't ever give up on money owed.' A spokesman for City of Edinburgh Council confirmed it would also pursue debtors through the electoral roll. 'The council uses all the data available to it to collect outstanding debts,' she said.

The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla), an umbrella group for councils, backed the steps. A spokesman said: 'Councils are within their rights to use whatever sources of information are available legally to pursue unpaid debt.

'Scotland's councils take collection of debt very seriously and place great emphasis on it for a number of reasons.

'Firstly, every pound of debt collected is a pound for frontline services, and secondly, they feel a moral obligation on those people who do diligently pay tax.'

The deeply unpopular poll tax was introduced in Scotland before the rest of the country, in 1989, and led to widespread rioting

The poll tax was abolished in 1993 but over the four years, councils billed Scots households for £3.678billion - of which just over £3.35billion was paid, leaving £324.4million still to be collected.

Arrears from the abolished tax in England and Wales were pursued through the court system. A six-year time limit was placed within which to collect debts.

But under Scottish law debts can be chased for 20 years.

The deeply unpopular poll tax was introduced in Scotland before the rest of the country, in 1989.

Replacing the Rates system, the Poll Tax led to the biggest protests since the Miners' Strike.

It was introduced by the Thatcher government to replace the property-rates system, with a simpler, individual local tax. 

Mass protests in Scotland were followed the year later in central London, and around the country, with violent scenes, looting, smashed shop fronts and mounted police battling to control rioters.

The poll tax, officially known as the community charge, was eventually scrapped  and was integral to the fall of Margaret Thatcher. 

It was eventually replaced by the council tax in 1993. 

And, if some effort has been made to recover the debt since 1993, the clock is then reset to 20 years since the last attempt was made.

Nationalists were also keen for councils to pursue poll tax arrears - but split on whether they should use voter registration to do it. 

Ian Brown, an SNP councillor in Highland, said: 'If people deliberately did not pay, and can afford to pay, then they should do. I would not be surprised if some councils are now potentially going after people who have suddenly popped up on their computer.'

But Councillor Callum McCaig, SNP leader in Aberdeen, said: 'Clearly, there is a duty on local authorities to pursue debts through means available to them but the fear that will be there for some folk, keeping them from exercising their vote, is bad for democracy and ultimately bad for government at all levels.'

Glasgow has the largest unpaid debt, with £125million outstand-ing. The council uses the electoral roll to trace debtors but is understood to be sceptical about how helpful the surge in registered voters will prove to be.

A spokesman said: 'We have a debt management partner that works with us to recover arrears, including Community Charge.

'However, it becomes increasingly difficult to secure payments from historic accounts as time passes. In many cases, it is impossible as a substantial number of people will now have passed away.'

Meanwhile, Alex Johnstone MSP, the welfare reform spokesman for the Scottish Tories said: 'Councils should do everything in their power to detect those who are evading council tax payments. If that means going through the electoral roll with a fine tooth comb, so be it.'

'Referendum gives us the opportunity' 'Fear may keep some from vote'
