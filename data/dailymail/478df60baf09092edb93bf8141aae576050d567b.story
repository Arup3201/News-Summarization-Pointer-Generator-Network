Nasa's Kepler telescope scans the skies for 'habitable worlds' - but an American chemist has suggested the whole project might be a terrible idea.

Ronald Breslow suggests that life-forms based on slightly different amino acids and sugars could take the form of huge, ferocious dinosaurs that have evolved to have human-like intelligence and technologies.

'We would be better off not meeting them,' says Breslow, who claims that it was a stroke of luck that an asteroid wiped out dinosaurs on earth, leaving the field clear for mammals such as humans.

Amino acid tryptophan: A scientists suggests that a tiny 'tweak' to such acids could mean life on other worlds evolved very differently

On other worlds, dinosaurs could have evolved into huge, intelligent warriors armed with hi-tech weaponry - but without losing their hunger for fresh meat.

'Of course,' Breslow says, 'Showing that it could have happened this way 
is not the same as showing that it did. An implication from 
this work is that elsewhere in the universe there could be life forms 
based on D-amino acids and L-sugars.

'Such life forms could well be 
advanced versions of dinosaurs, if mammals did not have the good fortune
 to have the dinosaurs wiped out by an asteroidal collision, as on 
Earth.

'We would be better off not meeting them.'

In the report, noted scientist Ronald Breslow, Ph.D., discusses the century-old mystery of why the building blocks of terrestrial amino acids (which make up proteins), sugars, and the genetic materials DNA and RNA exist mainly in one orientation or shape.

There are two possible orientations, left and right, which mirror each other in the same way as hands.

In order for life to arise, proteins, for instance, must contain only one chiral form of amino acids, left or right.

'Such life forms could well be advanced versions of dinosaurs, if mammals did not have the good fortune to have the dinosaurs wiped out by an asteroidal collision, as on Earth,' says Breslow

With the exception of a few bacteria, amino acids in all life on Earth have the left-handed orientation.

Most sugars have a right-handed orientation. How did that so-called homochirality, the predominance of one chiral form, happen?

Breslow describes evidence supporting the idea that the unusual amino acids carried to a lifeless Earth by meteorites about 4 billion years ago set the pattern for normal amino acids with the L-geometry, the kind in terrestial proteins, and how those could lead to D-sugars of the kind in DNA.
