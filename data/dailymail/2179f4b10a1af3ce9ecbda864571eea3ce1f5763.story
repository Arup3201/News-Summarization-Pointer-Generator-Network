As George Osborne's austerity cuts continue to hit many Britons it appears his own parents are not feeling the pinch quite yet.

The Chancellor's mother and father have bought a new £10 million house in West London, but they have done it without selling their own £15million luxury home just a few doors down.

In order to downsize, 17th Baronet Sir Peter Osborne and Lady Felicity have put their current six-bedroom home on the market but will not sell until the housing market improves.

Downsizing: Sir Peter Osborne and his wife Lady Felicity have bought a new house for £10 million just a few doors up from their current house in Notting Hill

In the meantime they have still managed to find another £10million to buy a five-bedroom property on the same street.

Their new Victorian semi was owned by Robert Gillespie, director-general of the Takeover Panel, the city regulator that oversees corporate mergers, the Sunday Times said.

And as part of the deal Mr Gillespie, who bought the house in 1994, can stay there until next year.

'They bought our house, but are still living down the road until March, when they'll move in here,' his daughter Imogen Gillespie told the Sunday Times.

It appears their current house will stay on the market, and is listed online along with a dozen dazzling pictures.

Future home: They have bought this property in the same street but will not move in until next year

Sir Peter's lavish spending could embarrass his son George, who has claimed 'we're all in this together' as he has pushed through public sector pay freezes and cuts in government spending.

Earlier this year Osborne Jr also faced questions over his father's spending habits as he cut the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p, with Sir Peter giving an interview to the upmarket consumer magazine How To Spend It.

In the interview, the 69-year-old baronet said he had his eye on a £19,000 Italian writing desk and spoke of his love of bespoke Savile Row suits.

He also crowed about his 'unforgettable' holidays abroad on the exclusive Caribbean island of Mustique, a millionaires' playground where royals and tycoons spend their time.

Land Registry records show the Osbornes bought their current home in 2006. They have since modified it by knocking through the semi's outside wall and filling the gap with the house next door to make it terraced.

Now though, with their sons George, 41, Benedict, 39, Adam, 36, and Theo, 27, having left home, the Osbornes have no need for such a large house.

With 4,600sq/ft of living space, the property, which dates back to the 1850s is being marketed by Estate Agent Savills as a 'unique property' with 'magical west-facing views'.

Plenty of space for family living: This picture shows a drawing room of the multimillion pound home, which boasts six bedrooms - nearly all with en-suite bathrooms

Well appointed: The Osbornes have bought another property on the same road for an estimated £10million, but will remain in the house until March next year

It boasts both private and communal 
gardens, six bedrooms, nearly as many bathrooms, staff quarters and 
off-road parking. However, it has yet to sell.

That
might be something do with its massive asking price. A property source 
told the Sunday Times that the Osbornes are asking for 'around 
£15million' for their West London des res - nearly three times as much 
as the average £4million asking price for homes on the same street.

A property valuation website estimates the value of their new home at around £10million.

The Osborne family's title dates back to 17th-century Ireland, when ancestor Richard Osborne was handed Ballentaylor in the County of Tipperary, and Ballylemon in the county of Wexford by the English throne.

George Osborne - who was born Gideon before changing his name at 13 - is the heir apparent to the title.

The family's current wealth comes from their upmarket wallpaper and fabric firm Osborne & Little, which Sir Peter co-founded with his brother-in-law Anthony Little in 1968.

The company, which had a turnover last year of £32.8million, has showrooms in Paris, Munich, Milan and on the King's Road in West London. It once fitted out the White House apartments for Bill and Hillary Clinton.
