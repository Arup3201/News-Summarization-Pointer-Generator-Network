More than 14,000 students who are predicted to get top grades at A-Level have been turned down by Oxford and Cambridge this year as competition for places has increased.

The universities are having to reject more than expected after hundreds of extra students applied to study there from September.

Cambridge has received 16,145 applications - 450 more than last year but will only make offers to  4,138 of those.

Oxford is still calculating its figures for 2013, but said it will be similar or slightly higher than the 17,241 from last year, where  3.233 had acceptances.

Nearly all people from the UK who apply for Oxbridge will be predicted to get at least three A's at A-Level.

'The university seeks the ablest and best-qualified students with the 
greatest potential from every background and every part of the UK,' a spokesman for Cambridge University told the Independent.

'Admissions decisions are based on students’ ability, commitment and 
their potential to achieve.  The success rate of suitably qualified 
applicants is broadly the same regardless of where in the UK they are 
from.

'Our outreach goal is to ensure that any student with the ability, 
passion and commitment to apply to Cambridge has a clear picture of what
 the university can offer them and receives all the support necessary 
for them to best demonstrate their potential.'

Figures show that applications to all Britain universities are up overall.

The 
Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) said in June there were 637, 500 applications, up from 618, 250 a year earlier.

Universities are charging up to £9,000 a year in fees and up to £35,000 for foreign students.

Competition: Despite being expected to get top grades at A-Level thousands will as usual be disappointed this year

But poor teenagers are still almost half as likely to go to university than richer classmates, official figures suggest.

Around a fifth of 15-year-olds receiving free school meals (FSM) - a key measure of poverty - went on to higher education in 2010/11, compared with more than a third of those not getting the dinners, according to statistics published by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS).

The data also shows that privately educated youngsters are more likely to study for a degree, and to go to the most selective universities, than state school peers.

It comes amid continuing efforts to encourage more poorer teenagers to consider going into higher education, and increasing investment by universities in the area.

The latest figures show that 20 per cent of pupils who were receiving free dinners at age 15 were in higher education by the time they were 19, compared with 38 per cent of non-FSM students - an 18 per cent gap.

The numbers of FSM pupils going to university has risen - in 2005/06 13 per cent went on to study for a degree compared with 33 per cent of other pupils - a 19 per cent gap.

Universities are planning to spend more than £700 million in 2017/18 on recruiting poorer students and those less likely to apply - an increase of more than £100 million from 2012/13, a BIS spokeswoman said.
