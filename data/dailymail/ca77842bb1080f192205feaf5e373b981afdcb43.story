A young mother has been jailed for accusing two men of rape - because she didn't want to get in trouble for staying out partying.

Emma Jones, 27, left her four young children with their grandparents while she went out clubbing.

But after returning home five hours late Jones claimed she had been sexually assaulted so her parents wouldn't be angry at her.

Cardiff Crown Court heard Jones told her mother and father that she would be back by 11pm.

But she arrived home at 4am and told her concerned parents that she had been raped.

They reported her claim to the police who later arrested two men and subjected them to intimate physical examinations.

But they were released after CCTV emerged of her kissing one of the men she had accused of the sex attack.

Police questioned Jones again and she admitted lying to avoid getting in trouble with her parents.

John Probert, prosecuting, said: 'She admitted she hadn't told the truth and that she'd had consensual sex.

'Every false allegation of rape increases the plight of those women who are genuinely victims of rape'

Judge Stephen Hopkins QC

'There had been arguments with her father and mother and she feared another argument on this occasion.'

Jones, of Aberbargoed, Caerphilly, South Wales, was jailed for two years and eight months.

Judge Stephen Hopkins QC told her: 'Every false allegation of rape increases the plight of those women who are genuinely victims of rape.

'It makes their allegations harder to prove as juries are concerned at the possibility of convicting an innocent man.

'When a rape allegation is made it's often very difficult to prove but also very difficult to refute and those accused can suffer from the stigma attached.'
