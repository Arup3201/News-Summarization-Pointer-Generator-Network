Crystal Palace boss Neil Warnock has told his players to throw caution to the wind and make the most of their attacking talents this season. 

The Eagles are unbeaten in the league since Warnock took over at the end of August, and have scored 10 goals in his five games in charge.

It is a noticeably different approach to that of former boss Tony Pulis, whose success at Selhurst Park last season was firmly centred on a strong work ethic and a mean defence.

'You have a way you want your team to play and you try to remind them of what they can do in certain situations and to not always think defensively,' Warnock said.

'I tell them to be positive in what they do - is the glass half empty or half full? It's always half full for me.'

Warnock continued: 'I think they can play more attacking. It's about belief, without forgetting their good habits.

'We have genuine lads who are committed and I think sometimes you have to try get that balance - while you want to be solid, I want to entertain as well if I can.

'The goals we've conceded haven't really been down to our opponents' ability - they've been down to elementary mistakes, so we've got to become that compact unit that I know we can be.

'But I also think we can create more so it's about having that belief to let ourselves go a bit more in midfield.

'(James) McArthur can score more goals, Mile Jedinak is a bit more free and I think he can get more goals - it's about them contributing more and not just leaving it to the strikers.'

After beating both Everton and Leicester, Palace are looking for their third straight victory in the Barclays Premier League when they travel to Hull on Saturday.

Warnock named four forwards on the bench for the Eagles' 2-0 win over the Foxes last weekend and he says that is symptomatic of the fearlessness he wants his players to show on the pitch.

'Every one of those forwards I've got at the moment can change the game, whether it's to win a game, calm us down, provide a spark - they've all got different attributes and at my age I'm willing to take that chance,' Warnock said.

'I've come into it to enjoy myself. At this stage of my life and career, that's what I want to do and I want the players to enjoy it if they can.

'We know there will be periods when we don't win for four or five games, but as long as they keep giving me everything I won't have a problem.'
