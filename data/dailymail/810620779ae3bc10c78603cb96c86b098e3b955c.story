India’s most beautiful and magnificent jewels have been gathered from across the world and put on display in the Kremlin in Moscow..

More than 300 dazzling pieces of jewellery and jewelled objects, some of which are up to 500 years old, are being brought together for the first time as part of the India: Jewels that Enchanted the World exhibit.

The Kremlin, known for its opulence and 
gilded interiors, will house the jewels, gems and precious metals - many
 of which have never been exhibited before.

The British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum have loaned some of their precious treasures, alongside over 30 other museums, institutions and private collections from around the world.

Under the watchful eye of the State Museums of Moscow Kremlin, headed by Dr Elena Gagarina, and the Indo-Russian Jewellery Foundation, founded by diamond and jewellery connoisseur Alex Popov, the exhibit will be presented in The Belfry and the One-Pillar Hall.

The jewellery, which is worth an estimated £1.5 million, includes bejewelled dancing peacocks, stunning pieces of gold decorated with flowers made of gems, necklaces made of golden wires, and elaborate crowns and hair jewels fit for gods and goddesses.

Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala  was one of Cartier's main clients

The Mughals, who ruled as emperors, loved spectacular pieces such as this  rigid collar-necklaces which is studded with gems and is designed to cascade down the neck

Cartier picked up on the Indian colour scheme in this 1925 platinum necklace which is studded with diamonds, sapphires and emeralds and this 'Tutti Frutti'  bracelet wristwatch (right) also designed by Cartier

This intricate pendant was created in the late 16th century for the Mughals. Truly extravagant, it is made of gold, pearl, rubies, diamonds, emeralds and blue glass

Something different: This grand water vessel (left) doubles as a tobacco bowl and is made of gold. Slightly more understated than other items in the collection, this diamond and gold necklace is still worth a fortune

Some of the oldest and most elaborate pieces date back to the Mughal courts where gold, gems and enamel were designed to reflect the power and culture of the conquering and lavish Mughal dynasty. 

Turban jewels, emblems of sovereignty, sparkle with table-cut diamonds, while rigid collar-necklaces are studded with gems and cascade down the neck. 

The genius of Mughal design and craftsmanship are illustrated by armbands set with diamonds, exquisitely enamelled bangles with animal-head terminals and a tiny box, set with 103 exquisitely carved emeralds. 

One section of the exhibit shows off jewelry from the late 19th and early 20th centuries when India and Europe began to cross cultures and influence one another.

Although only 10cm tall, this pendant (left) is made from gold, rubies, diamonds and emeralds and would fetch a good price at auction, while this extravagant pearl and diamond necklace is much more obviously dramatic

Famous brands such as Cartier, Chaumet, Mauboussin, Mellerio and Van Cleef & Arpels all turned to India for precious stones and inspiration. Sapphires, emeralds and rubies carved into flowers and leaves became an integral part of Cartier’s 'Tutti Frutti' style.

The maharajas were among their main clients and for them they created an extraordinary jewels combining Indian colour, motifs and forms with European elegance and techniques. Cartier’s creations for their most esteemed client, Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala, consisted of an entire range of jewels.
