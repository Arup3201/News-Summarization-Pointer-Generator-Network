A couple in New York allegedly beat, kicked, tortured and starved their 12-year-old daughter for more than two years. 

Rajesh Ranot, 46, and step-mother Sheetal Ranot, 31, of Ozone Park, were arraigned last week on multiple charges of assault and child endangerment. 

The district attorney’s office said the 12-year-old girl, weighing only 58 pounds, repeatedly beaten with a baseball bat, rolling pin and broken metal broom handle, and was locked in her room without food and water for long periods of time between Dec. 1, 2012 and May 6, 2014, reported CBS New York.

The girl was initially afraid to come forward about the alleged abuse because she did not want her younger step-siblings to be taken away by authorities and placed in foster care, the district attorney's office said. 

'Fortunately, she found the courage to speak up,' said Queens District Attorney Richard Brown.

 'It is not too hard to imagine that this case would have ended in the child's death.'

According to the station, the suspects' daughter was also allegedly locked in her room without food or water for long periods of time between December 1, 2012 and May 6, 2014. 

Authorities say her step-mother Ranot slashed Maya Ranot with the jagged end of a broken metal broom handle on May 6 leaving such a deep laceration it went through to the bone. 

That is when she was taken to hospital from the family home above a garage in Ozone Park with a gash deep enough to reveal the bone on her left wrist and doctors reported their suspicions. 

Rajesh Ranot, the girl's biological father, is charged with second- and third-degree assault, first-degree unlawful imprisonment and endangering the welfare of a child.

Sheetal Ranot ischarged with second-degree assault and endangering the welfare of a child on July 29; on August  1, she was charged with first- and second-degree assault and endangering the welfare of a child.

If convicted, both parents could face at least seven years in prison.
