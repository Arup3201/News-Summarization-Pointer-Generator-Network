Diego Simeone has poured cold water on speculation linking him with a move away from Atletico Madrid, insisting he is happy at the club and that he has unfinished business with the Spanish champions.

Simeone has seen his stock go sky-high since taking over at Atletico in 2011 and the Argentinian has recently seen his name mentioned in relation to possible moves to Manchester City and Paris St Germain should either of the European big-spenders decide on a coaching change.

However, echoing the comments of Atletico president Enrique Cerezo over the weekend, Simeone has dismissed suggestions he may be on his way out of the Vicente Calderon any time soon, and says he is still looking at ways to make the Rojiblancos even better.

Diego Simeone's stock has risen sharply since taking control of Atletico Madrid in 2011

The former Argentina international led Atletico to the La Liga title last season, their first since 1996

Simeone also took the club to their first ever Champions League final, and won the Europa League in 2012

He told Spanish newspaper Marca: 'I feel very good at Atletico. I always want to continue improving, I'm never satisfied. I don't know what the limit of this team is, I will continue looking.'

In just three years in charge of Atletico, the 44-year-old has guided the club to their first Primera Division title since 1996 and their maiden Champions League final.

As well as that, Simeone has won the Europa League, the Copa del Rey, UEFA Super Cup and Spanish Supercopa with Atletico.

The former Argentina international, who also had two spells as a player with Atletico in the 1990s and 2000s, added: 'The happiness of completing three years at a club that I love so much is huge. I always think they can get rid of me, (but) I'm only thinking about Malaga.'

Atletico host Malaga on Saturday as they look to bounce back from their 2-1 defeat to Real Sociedad before the international break. That result left the champions in fourth place in the table, four points behind leaders Real Madrid.
