Ronnie Morshead's catering company has been investigated after a Salmonella incident

My Kitchen Rules judge Manu Feildel’s ex-partner has been linked to a Salmonella outbreak at a primary school thought to have been caused by to a raw egg sauce that was served.

Jamaican-born chef Ronnie Morshead, who has in the past catered for the likes of Elton John and Andrew Lloyd Webber, runs Red Sage Catering – the company that provided the food served at Double Bay Public School, in Sydney, which is thought to have left a number of people ill.

The Salmonella incident  took place in December 2014 at a Year 6 leavers’ event, the Daily Telegraph reports.

When six people were affected, South Eastern Sydney Area Health Service reported the incident to the NSW Food Authority who investigated the possible cause.

A NSW Food Authority spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: ‘Upon receiving notification of a possible foodborne illness event from South Eastern Sydney Area Health Service, the NSW Food Authority commenced an investigation into the incident.’

The authority said the investigation is now complete.

‘The outcome of the source was a possible link to a raw egg sauce served. Raw eggs are a common source of salmonella outbreaks around Australia,’ the spokesperson said.

‘The NSW Food Authority has worked with the home based catering business involved in the reported incident and provided the operator with advice, guidance and information in relation to food safety requirements.’

Double Bay Public School in Sydney's east suffered a Salmonella poisoning incident at Year 6 leavers' event

Professor Mark Ferson, Director, Public Health Unit, South Eastern Sydney Local Health District, told Daily Mail Australia: ‘[we were] alerted to a Salmonella/food poisoning incident at a Year 6 farewell event at Double Bay Public School, following lab notifications of a particular strain of Salmonella linked to the school event.’

Professor Ferson said a total of six confirmed Salmonella cases were linked to this incident.

‘Due to the low number of confirmed cases, we are unable to provide specific details to protect the identity of those confirmed cases,’ Professor Ferson added.

Symptoms relating to Salmonella poisoning include headache, fever, stomach cramps, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.

They usually become apparent 6-72 hours after infection and last for 4-7 days, sometimes much longer.

‘In Australia, most Salmonella infections occur after eating contaminated food or sometimes after contact with another person with the infection. Safe food handling including thorough cooking of meat, poultry and eggs and good hand hygiene can prevent infection,’ Professor Ferson said.

Ronnie, who learned her trade in the UK, met TV chef Manu while working in London. They separated in 2009

Ronnie, who learned her trade in the UK, met TV chef Manu while working as an A La Carte chef in award winning restaurant Livebait, in Waterloo, London.

In 1999, the couple relocated to Sydney and Ronnie gave birth to their son Jonti in 2005.

They separated after 12 years together in 2009 and 40-year-old Manu is now engaged to Clarissa Weerasena.

Speaking recently to Daily Mail Australia, Manu said about Clarissa: 'She's going to be delivering very soon.'

Clarissa gave birth to their baby on February 9.  

When asked if the two had set a date to be married, Manu revealed the pregnancy changed their plans.

Manu Feildel used his former partner Ronnie Morshead's catering service for his 40th birthday party 

'Not yet, the baby came before... we were supposed to get married first so everything has been changed!'

'I think it was good timing, Clarissa being pregnant while I was working [on MKR] and now it's going to be down time for me.'

Ronnie and Manu remain friends, with Ronnie’s Red Sage catering company providing the food for Manu’s 40th birthday party.

In a glowing testimony on her website, Manu wrote: ‘I’d like to say thank you to Ronnie and her team for the fantastic food and service provided for my 40th.

‘The food was absolutely delicious; we had an amazing selection of very creative little bites packed with flavour.

‘All of our guests commented on both the food and service provided and the ability to provide a tailored menu for our guests with dietary requirements. I have since recommended Red Sage to everyone who comes to me for recommendation.

‘If you are after quality food served by a highly professional and friendly staff then you cannot go past Red Sage. See you at my 41st!’
