A paramedic who claimed to be gay, raped one woman while a student and sexually assaulted two others, has been jailed for 12 years.

Christopher Bridger, 25, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire raped his first victim while a student paramedic in London in September 2008. 

He later assaulted two of his colleagues at the South East Coast Ambulance service after pretending he was gay and befriending the women.

Bridger was found guilty of one count of rape and four others of sexual abuse following a 12-day trial at Guildford Crown Court in Surrey. 

The seven men and four women took four hours to return a guilty verdict, however he was acquitted of two further charges of sex assault by penetration and a sex assault on two other women who he knew. 

All three victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are in their 20s. They were forced to give evidence during the trial, during which Bridger accused each of them of lying. 

The first victim said she had been raped after a fancy dress party during Freshers' Week party at George's University Hospital in September 2008. 

The woman said Bridger had told her he was gay and accompanied her back to her halls of residence after the party when they started to kiss and cuddle.  

The woman said she told Bridger to stop, who ignored her wishes and raped her. 

The court heard that Bridger broke down in tears following the attack and admitted: 'I just want to like girls.' 

The girl said she had even comforted Bridger even though she knew what he had done was wrong. 

Later, Bridger started working for the South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust in 2010.

Guildford Crown Court heard that his second victim was assaulted as she lay in bed with her lesbian lover after the work Christmas party in December 2011.

The court heard that he woman had got extremely intoxicated and had a row with her girlfriend on the night of the attack.

Bridger's collegue told the jury how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at the party.

She had been arguing with her girlfriend, who started recording her drunken rant on her mobile phone.

Audio of that recording was played to the jury, during which Bridger is heard to come into the room and ask the woman for a hug and a kiss, which she obliged to, thinking he was gay.

Afterwards, Bridger climbed into bed between his victim and her partner, she said.

The woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. She kept quiet, fearing her partner wouldn't understand what had happened.

The day after was Bridger's birthday and he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising for his behaviour.

One text said: 'It was one night of stupidity for which I will be eternally sorry.'

Another said: 'You don't have to forgive me, I'm just telling you the truth. I'm ashamed of myself.'

His final victim was also a colleague from the South East Coast Ambulance Service, who said she was sexually assaulted after she allowed him to stay the night at her house after a dinner in October 2012.

The court heard all the women had been told by Bridger - and believed him - that he was openly gay.

Bridger was suspended from work after the incidents were reported to South East Coast Ambulance Service management in late 2012.

Despite being told not to contact any of the alleged victims, he left a voicemail message with the final complainant on Christmas morning in 2012, in which he was 'full of self-pity.'

Following an internal NHS inquiry, Surrey Police arrested Bridger in January 2013 and he denied any involvement, telling detectives that he was a gay man who had been in several same sex relationships.

He had been separately arrested by the Metropolitan Police and questioned in relation to the allegations while he was a student paramedic.

Bridger did admit having sex with his rape victim but claimed that it was consensual and an experience 'that confirmed I am gay.'

He claimed the other incidents had just been 'drunken fumbles' and that the women were lying.

Court Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith handed down a 12 year sentence earlier today. 

Mr Milliken-Smith said: 'These were wicked, mean and utterly cowardly offences which have and will have serious consequences on these young women and those around them for a very long time.

'In each case the young woman in question believed you were gay. You told everyone you were gay. They never contemplated you presented a danger to them.

'They trusted you in situations they would not have allowed heterosexual men.

'You took advantage of that belief.'

Mr Milliken-Smith criticised Bridger for putting his victims through the trauma of a trial.

He said: 'Each of your victims has suffered great and prolonged trauma by virtue of what you have done.

'That trauma has been exacerbated quite considerably by having to relive those events at trial.'

Guildford Crown Court, pictured, heard Bridger added to the women's trauma by forcing them to testify  

Describing impact statements written by Bridger's victims, prosecutor Caroline Carberry said: 'The overwhelming feeling of the victims in this case are those of disbelief, self-doubt, guilt, shame and a very real sense of betrayal by someone they trusted.

'The destructive effect of this defendant's actions is very clear from the statements provided.'

Brian Aldred defending, said Bridger was 'shocked and upset at the pain and distress his actions have caused for those victims'.

Mr Aldred added: 'No human being is wholly evil.

'We all have our good sides and our bad sides.

'Today Christopher Bridger's bad sides are going to be there for everybody to see and he is going to be punished for them.'

Bridger was jailed for eight years for rape and four years for sexual assault by penetration, to run consecutively.

He was jailed for 12 months for one of the sexual assaults and six months for the other and sentenced to 18 months in prison for the inciting charge, all to run concurrently with the rape and penetration charges.

The judge also told him he would spend three years on prison licence after the end of his custody spell.

Bridger nodded to family members as he was led from the dock.
