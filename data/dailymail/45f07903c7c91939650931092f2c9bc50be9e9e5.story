A 34-year-old mother of two shot and killed her young daughters at their upscale New Hampshire home before turning the gun on herself in what has been ruled as a murder-suicide.

Assistant Attorney General Jay McCormack said police received a 911 call Saturday regarding a deceased woman at the home in Bedford. When officers arrived, they found two more bodies.

The attorney general's office Monday identified them as Nina Obukhov and her two daughters, 8-year-old Katherine and 6-year-old Elizabeth.

Murder-suicide: Nina Obukhov, 36, was found dead at this upscale Bedford, New Hampshire, home after killing her two young daughters, ages 6 and 8, and then herself 

A makeshift memorial appears on display in front of the Obukhov residence on McAfee Farm Road 

Autopsies confirmed that all three died of gunshot wounds to the head. The girls' deaths were ruled homicides. The manner of the mother's death remained undetermined, but authorities said it appeared the mother shot the girls and then committed suicide.

Flowers and stuffed animals were left next to a pile of yellow police tape outside the home Monday morning. 

At the school Katherine, known as 'Katy,' attended, officials were trying to provide the children with as much normalcy as possible while also making grief counselors available.

Deidre Helmke's son was in the same class as Katy for both first and second grade as part of a class that stayed together for their first two years of elementary school. 

Helmke, who served as 'room mother' for first grade at riddle Brook Elementary School, described it as a tight-knit group. On Monday, she was flipping through school yearbooks looking at pictures of Katy, whom she remembered as a 'little peanut.'

'She was a sweet little blonde-haired girl, quiet,' Helmke said.

Helmke said Nina Obukhov also was quiet. While she didn't know her well, she saw Obukhov at school and occasionally bumped into her while running errands.

It is believed that Alexey Obukhov and his wife Nina lived in the home with their two daughters, aged 6 and 8

'She didn't stand out as being any different from any other mom,' she said. 'She would chat a bit about the kids and then move on.'

While school officials notified parents about the deaths on Sunday, they did not identify the victims, leaving Helmke and other parents unsure what to tell their children. 

Not wanting him to find out at school, she told her son that she 'heard a report that Katy passed away.' He teared up and wanted to know how.

'I told him I honestly don't know, and I gave him a hug,' she said.

On Sunday, police were searching for Nina Obukhov's gun store owner husband, Alexey, but Monday's news release by the attorney general's office made no mention of the missing man.

Although police have said they are not looking for suspects, a 'be-on-the-lookout alert' was issued by National Emergency Alerts - New England at about 11.40pm on Saturday on Facebook.

The statement announced that they were looking for Obukhov and his maroon BMW coupe with New Hampshire plates.

Obukhov is the owner of a guns and ammo shop in Merrimack, which made headlines in 2013 after hanging pictures of President Barack Obama with Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong calling Obama 'firearm salesman of the year'.

He is also the owner of a company called New Vector Corporation, according to online records. He also is the president of Collectible Arms and Ammo II Corp.

Obukhov was previously arrested in August 2013 for a domestic violence assault but the charges were dismissed after his wife declined to testify, according to the Bedford Patch.

State and Bedford Police, along with a SWAT Team arrived on scene on Saturday. Police continued to investigate at the house throughout the day on Sunday

Then last year he filed a civil lawsuit against Bedford Police Chief John Bryfonski, seeking that all of his firearms and ammunition be returned to him

The lawsuit was denied, but Obukhov sued and in November, the state's highest court ordered that Obukhov's application for a pistol revolver license be granted even though Bryfonski believed that he was unsuitable to possess a concealed weapon, according to court records. 

New Hampshire State Police and SWAT vehicles were on the scene in Beford, blocking off the street and access to the home. The Attorney's General Office is also part of the investigation. 

'This tragedy will affect all of us, and it will affect Riddle Brook School in particular,' Superintendent Chip McGee said in an email to parents of the Bedford School District on Sunday morning, reports Union Leader.

Very few details about the case have been released, and causes of death and names of victims are being withheld pending the notification of family

Police blocked off the road in Bedford where the Obukhovs allegedly lived for the remainder of Saturday

While reassuring the public that there is no threat to the community, McGee said the school district is coordinating with the National Alliance of Mental Illness and the Attorney General's Office Crisis Response Team. 

'Starting on Monday morning, we will have additional counselors at Riddle Brook School to work with those most affected. Counseling staff at all of our schools will be available to talk with students, parents and staff,' McGee said in his statement. 

'... This event will be known in our community, even among our children. Information travels fast. The event may trigger difficult memories and strong emotions in people.'
