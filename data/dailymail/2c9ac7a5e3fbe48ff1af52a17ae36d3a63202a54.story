We may be 
waving goodbye to summer style but Christopher Bailey has already whet 
our appetites for next year - and it looks set to be one colourful 
season.

The
 Burberry boss sent his models - a who's who from the world's top 
agencies - down his rainbow coloured catwalk in a sumptuous selection of
 layered tulle dresses, cropped denim jackets and classic trenches 
inspired by the birds and the bees.

New
 girl on the block Malaika Firth opened the stellar show, which was set 
against the sun-drenched backdrop of Kensington Gardens, followed by the
 likes of Sam Rollinson, Suki Waterhouse, Jourdan Dunn and Charlotte 
Wiggins all dressed head-to-toe in the British heritage label's latest 
offering.

Colourful catwalk: Suki Waterhouse closed the stellar Burberry Prorsum SS15 show at Kensington Gardens today wearing the reworked trench inspired by the birds and the bees

Insects of
 Britain was Bailey's point of reference and he translated this onto the
 catwalk via butterfly printed satin skirts, bags emblazoned with 
hand-drawn honey bees and his iconic trench reworked for SS15 in every 
colour in the rainbox from dragonfly blue to beetle green.

Suki Waterhouse showed us how to do organza
 for spring as she and the other Burberry girls stomped the catwalk in 
the most beautiful layered tulle dresses in poppy rosehip, which were 
sometimes teamed with lilac suede cropped jackets.

Waists
 were nipped with cobweb tulle belts, creating a waspish silhouette 
adhering to the theme of the show, which was watched from the frow by 
Anna Wintour, Poppy and Cara Delevingne, Kate Moss and Mario Testino.

Bailey,
 famed for his ability to reinvent the classics, reworked the iconic 
trench for next season in the brightest of hues with typographic prints 
and colourful high gloss collars.

In a rare twist, models wore exclusively flat shoes, including field sneakers (which of course Cara 
already owns a pair of and wore to the show) and leather sliders, meaning well-heeled 
fashionistas can breath a much-needed sigh of relief come spring.

Look who it is! Jourdan Dunn was amongst the models strutting their stuff in Bailey's show inspired by Insects of Britain, which he translated onto the catwalk via butterfly printed satin skirts and bags

Accessories wise, today welcomed the arrival of the Burberry Bee Bag and matching mini bag in poppy red, pale sweet pea and the most vibrant turquoise hue, broken up with the classic Horseferry check. Men carried book cover print pouches that borrowed just enough from the archives.

Hats, today worn by the few male models on the catwalk, made their first appearance at the menswear show back in June. The collection, entitled ‘Book Covers & Bruce Chatwin’ featured original illustrations and typographic prints that took their creative lead from vintage English book covers. As always, artworks were designed and painted in-house before being printed onto cashmere, cotton and leather.

Models, whose make-up had been applied by Wendy Rowe using Burberry, of course, walked to the live sounds of James Bay, and hair had been coiffed to perfection by Neil Moodie.

Burberry was founded in 1856 but has moved with the times under Bailey. Their flagship Regent Street store in London is not just a place to shop but a hub of new technology with interactive mirrors, concert-quality sound systems and giant screens streaming their catwalk shows.

Speaking to the MailOnline, Bailey said it's all about involving people around the world and making them feel part of the experience - even if they can't be there in person.

He said: 'It's about doing something that makes people smile, that makes people want to engage, whether it's online, whether it's physical, whether it's at the show like this.'
