A teenage girl has had her hair ripped from her scalp by a drill machine during wood shop class.

The horrific accident occurred after 17-year-old Kayla Carrera's hair became tangled on Wednesday afternoon at Deltona High School, Florida, leaving a fellow student to tear her free.

'It just keeps throbbing and it burns a 
lot,' Kayla, whose head now only bears clumps of hair, told CFNews13. 
'It feels like open flesh.'

Despite her injuries and obvious trauma from the incident, the school failed to call 911 for medical assistance - a decision her mother is lambasting as negligent.

Kayla, who admits she should have had her hair tied back during the class, immediately started screaming for help after she became tangled and a student tugged out her hair, WKMG reported.

Nancy Holland Wait, spokeswoman for 
Volusia County Schools, said a school nurse looked at the girl's 
injuries and deemed they did not need to call 911.

But her mother, Lissette Carrera, disagrees, pointing out that her daughter in now largely bald and suffered bruising and swelling from the incident.

Lissette said her 'heart was crushed' 
that the pain her daughter suffered wasn't deemed to be an emergency. 
She works at an kindergarten in the district and would have called 911, 
she said.

'As an educator, I'm also a mother and 
I'm a mom first,' she said. 'I would never place a child in jeopardy 
like they placed my daughter.'

She added that the school was negligent for failing to enforce rules that her daughter should have had her hair tied up.

'If she wasn’t following the 
rules in the classroom, she should have never been allowed on that 
machine in the first place because the teacher himself is putting her at
danger,' she said.

'He’s the adult, he supervises, she is the student. He should have told 
her, put your hair back before you get on the machine, these are the 
rules of the classroom, you must follow them.'

Anger: Her mother, Lissette, said she was outraged the school did not call 911 for medical attention

Lissette added that someone in the school should have called her about her daughter's injuries, but instead it was up to the teenager to phone for help. She called her grandmother in tears.

Fannie Seda said she rushed to her granddaughter and was 'shaking all over because the sight of her head was terrible'. She almost fainted when she saw her, she added.

'My husband had to pick me up and I said I must rush her to the emergency room right now,' she said.

They went to Florida Hospital Fish Memorial and Kayla was given painkillers, which she continues to take.

Scene: Staff at the Florida school said a nurse checked Kayla and deemed they did not need to call 911

'I would rather err to the side of 
caution,' her mother added. 'Someone there should have made the judgment
call to call 911. She shouldn’t have called for help herself.'

The school district opened an investigation on Thursday morning to see if the teacher took appropriate action and if he had appropriate supervision in the classroom at the time.

Carrera said she also met with the principal at Deltona High and the shop teacher on Thursday to discuss what had happened and said the school is looking into making safety changes.
