These incredible photographs show the moment a pair of frogs camouflaged themselves against a leaf to help protect their precious eggs.

The amphibians can barely be seen at a quick glance as they cling to the green foliage at the La Selva Biological Research Station in Costa Rica.

The stunning images of the reticulated glass frogs, which were taken by British wildlife photographers Michael and Patricia Fogden, show the animals watching over their unhatched offspring.

Glass frogs lay their eggs out of water to stay away from predators and often pick leaves overhanging streams so that when the tadpoles hatch they drop into the water. Once hatched, the tadpoles hide among leaf litter

The tiny male - who measures just 19 - 24mm in length - has been keeping guard over the eggs and has even been moistening them with water in dry weather.

Mr Fogden said the animals choose to lay their eggs out of the water to stay out of the reach of predators which lurk there.

He said: 'They pick leaves overhanging streams so that when the tadpoles hatch they drop into the water.

'Once in the water, the newly hatched tadpoles swim to the edges of the stream and hide themselves amongst the leaf litter.

'The dad looks over them during the day and protects the eggs from parasitic wasps, flies, and small predators like ants and spiders.

'In temperate zones most frogs lay their eggs in water, leaving their tadpoles to develop without any parental care so it would be very unusual there.

'Several species of frogs in tropical rainforests use this or a similar strategy but it is unusual for the male to attend the eggs throughout daylight hours.'

Mr Fogden, who, along with his wife, divides his time  between Norfolk in the UK and Ecuador in South America, said they timed their visit to the research centre to tie in with the frogs' breeding season.

He said: 'The frogs are well camouflaged, especially in the dappled light of the forest canopy, but we knew the sort of place to search for them.

'Glass frogs live along rainforest streams so we were wading knee-deep in fast-flowing water, searching for frogs and clutches of eggs hidden under leaves.

'We timed our visit to be there in the rainy season, the time when these frogs breed.

'The day before there had been torrential rain and by nightfall hundreds of frogs had gathered to breed at rivers, streams and ponds.

'It was an amazing experience to be among them and the noise was deafening - a cacophony of whoops, croaks, peeps and trills.

'The males of each species was oblivious of all else except making their presence known in order to attract a mate.'
