A woman left almost bald by an impulsive disorder compelling her to tear her hair out, was forced to pay for treatment deemed a 'cosmetic' procedure.

Cheryl Mitchell faced a 13-year uphill battle with doctors to receive a diagnosis and then treatment.

The 33-year-old from Rhyl, North Wales, recognised her own symptoms after reading a magazine article about trichotillomania when she was 20 years old.

But despite her insistence that she knew what was wrong, Miss Mitchell has struggled to receive treatment.

Part of the treatment involves stitching hair extensions into a mesh barrier on the scalp and as such is deemed 'cosmetic'.

Cheryl Mitchell, 33, from Rhyl, North Wales, suffers trichtillomania - a compulsion to tear her hair out

For 13 years she faced an uphill battle to receive treatment. She has been forced to pay for a new hair mesh, to act as a barrier and allow her hair to grow underneath, because it is consider a 'cosmetic' procedure

As a result, Miss Mitchell has been forced to pay for the procedure herself.

'I've walked past loads of people already, said hello and they haven't recognised me, I look so different. My head's a bit sore, but it's all right.

'My hair was maybe half an inch long all over with patches. They've put a very thin mesh on my head, and pulled the thin bits of my own hair through.

'Then they sewed human hair through, so everything is kept in place by my own hair.'

The mesh barrier is designed to protect her own hair for the next six months, allowing it to grow back.

Trichtillomania is recognised by the NHS, and cases have been documented as far back as 1889.

The 33-year-old is also receiving cognitive behaviourial therapy on the NHS to help her overcome the condition which left her nearly bald

But it remains a condition commonly misunderstood by GPs.

Miss Mitchell said as a result, she faced an uphill struggle for treatment.

She diagnosed her own illness when she read about someone else suffering with it in a magazine, 13 years ago. 

The then 20-year-old visited a clinic in Manchester to find out more about the treatment, but was told it would cost her £9,000.

'I went to the doctor on and off for 13 years trying to get this treatment on the NHS, but they wouldn't give me the time of day,' she said.

'They just offered me wigs. I got one, but that doesn't really help.'

Miss Mitchell,  said: 'I've seen loads of doctors, I've been asking them about my hair loss since I was five, and not once has any doctor known of it and offered me counselling or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), I'm doing CBT now after I told them I was getting my hair done.

'I didn't know about all of the treatments I could try until last year. They'd only offered me wigs.

'I don't know if it'll work or not, but it's worth a go.'

The new hair system takes the 33-year-old up to two hours each day to look after, and while costs have come down since she first found a treatment, it still cost her £800, but should last up to two years.

According to the NHS website, trichotillomania is more common in girls than boys, and may affect up to four in 100 people.

Trichtillomania affects up to four in every 100 of the population, and is common in teenagers 

Trichtillomania is a condition where sufferers are compelled to tear their hair out.

It is common in teenagers and young adults, affects up to four in every 100 people.

They can pull hair from their head, as well as other places including their eyebrowns and eyelashes.

Trichtillomania is an impulse-control disorder - a psychological condition where you are unable to stop yourself carrying out a particular action.

Sufferers experience an intense urge to pull their hair out, and growing tension until they do.

Once they've pulled their hair out, they are overcome by a sense of relief.

The condition, which leaves sufferers with bald patches, can invoke negative feelings, including guilt.

People feel embarrassed and ashamed, and may try to deny it and cover it up.

Experts do not know what causes the compulsion, but some believe it is a form of addiction.

Others think it is a reflection of a mental health problem, with psychological and behaviourial theories suggesting it is a means of relieving stress and anxiety.

In some cases experts believe the condition amounts to self-harm, deliberate injury to achieve temporary relief from emotional distress.

Recognised treatments for the condition include psychotherapy, allowing patients to talk about the emotional problems underlying their compulsion.

Cognitive behaviourial therapy may be recommended, helping a person manage their problems by changing how they think and act.
