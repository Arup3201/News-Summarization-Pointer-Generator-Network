A creative pair spent six weeks creating a lifesize model of a Spitfire made from 6,500 egg boxes.

The replica of the Battle of Britain fighter was built using five litres of glue, 5,000 nails, ten litres of paint and 10,000 staples.

The 36ft-long Supermarine Spitfire was constructed using Eggs for Soldiers cartons and will go on display at  Imperial War Museum Duxford in Cambridgeshire.

To mark Help for Heroes event March Fourth, Charlotte Austen, 27, and Jack Munro, 26, used 450 Pritt sticks to glue the cartons together.

In addition to thousands of egg boxes, they used 772ft of wooden batten, 100 square metres of canvas and 82ft of steel.

The model of the iconic World War II plane was also constructed with 25 sheets of plywood and 23ft of foam.

Mr Munro, an architect from Hackney, London, said: ‘It has been hugely enjoyable working on such a unique project for a fantastic charity.

‘The biggest challenge in building the Eggs for Soldiers Spitfire was to recreate the plane's iconic but complex geometry as accurately as possible.

‘Every surface of the Spitfire is double curved.

‘To replicate this we have used a combination of traditional timber construction techniques and advanced digital processes such as laser cutting and CNC routing.

Charlotte, a sculptor, also from Hackney, said: ‘Working on the Spitfire has been quite a challenge and one I have enjoyed immensely.

‘It has been a huge honour to do a project for Eggs for Soldiers in support of Help for Heroes, a charity I believe in enormously.

‘I hope everyone enjoys seeing it as much as we did making it.’

While constructing the model the pair also drank 120 cups of tea and chomped their way through six packets of chocolate hob nobs and 18 cream eggs.

Jack added: ‘The project has been hectic due to the enormous amount of work, which resulted in a number of sleep-deprived nights.

‘There were a few bangs and accidents along the way too - one our helpers even had to go to A&E for stitches after she slipped and sliced a chunk of her thumb off.

‘I suffered a gash to the head after bumping into the model and also got the inevitable cuts and bruises you would expect with building a model like this.

Now in its second year, March Fourth is an annual fundraising event in aid of Help for Heroes.

Supporters are encouraged to 'march forth 'with Eggs for Soldiers in support of servicemen, women and veterans who have suffered life-changing injuries and illnesses.

Eggs for Soldiers was created in 2011 to aid wounded servicemen and women returning from conflict.

Steve Horton, Marketing Director for Noble Foods, said: ‘We are hugely proud of the Eggs for Soldiers brand and our work supporting this incredibly worthwhile charity.

‘We hope this year's March Fourth campaign will be as successful as last year's.

‘That way we can continue to raise money and awareness for Help for Heroes and the vital support they give our servicemen and women.’

So far Eggs for Soldiers has raised over 650,000 for Help for Heroes, for further information visit www.eggsforsoldiers.co.uk.
