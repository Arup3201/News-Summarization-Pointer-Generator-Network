Undoing their top buttons, shaking off their staid images, and cutting loose on the TV dancefloor has almost become a rite of passage for today's leading newsreaders.

But it seems that Jeremy Paxman won't be joining his colleagues any time soon. 

The Newsnight presenter has turned on his fellow journalists' light hearted performances on shows such as Children In Need and Strictly Come Dancing, saying he would pay good money 'not to watch newsreaders making t**** of themselves.'

Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman has turned on his fellow newsreaders' light hearted performances on shows such as Children In Need and Strictly Come Dancing, saying he would pay good money 'not to watch newsreaders making t**** of themselves'

In an interview with BBC Radio 2's Steve Wright he said: 'I don’t understand why they want to do it', although he did admit that it helped to raise money for the children's charity.

He revealed he had twice been approached by producers of Strictly Come Dancing to appear on the show, but said: 'You want your head examined to do that.'

Mr Paxman's BBC News colleague, Susanna Reid, is currently appearing on the latest series of Strictly.

And it comes just days after fellow Newsnight presenter Kirsty Wark ended last Halloween’s edition of Newsnight with a dance. 

Kirsty Wark closed the Halloween edition of Newsnight dancing to Michael Jackson's 'Thriller'. It's difficult to imagine Paxman doing the same

Sha-moan: The 58-year-old stunned viewers of the typically more staid programme with her dance moves

While Twitter users loved the segment, nut the flagship BBC programme has been accused of dumbing down recently

Miss Wark, 58, surprised viewers by joining ten dancers to perform part of the routine to Michael Jackson’s hit Thriller, along with ten 
theatre students who joined her live in the studio.

Following
a package about the Chilean dictator Pinochet where his spokesman 
admitted ‘atrocities’ were committed, the broadcaster got in to 
character and began to dance.

The 58-year-old newscaster said: ‘That’s just about all from this Halloween night. Be careful out there, goodnight.’

Other journalists to take part Children in Need performances, include Emily Maitlis, another of Paxman’s fellow Newsnight presenters, Sophie Raworth, Fiona Bruce and Kate Silverton.

Others newsreaders and journalists to appear on Strictly show include Bill Turnbull, John Sergeant and Chris Hollins.

Mr Paxman made the comments in an interview with the Radio 2 disc jockey, one of a series available to download to raise money for Children in Need night, which will be held on November 15.
