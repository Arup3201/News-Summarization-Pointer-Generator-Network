Students were among those injured on Tuesday afternoon when a gunman opened fire near an Atlanta High School, wounding five teenagers.

Four of the five victims were shot in the lower body, and one was hit in the chest, but all are expected to survive.Â 

Nearby Therrell High School was put on 
lock down for about an hour after the shooting, and all after-school 
activities were canceled as police began a manhunt.

Investigation: Police cordon off the street close to Therrell High School, where a gunman shot five people

The gunman was still on the run by Tuesday evening. He is described as an African-American male in his mid to late teens.

Atlanta police have not said whether they believe he was a student, or what the motive for the attack was.

Four of those who were shot are students, though it is not yet clear if they were enrolled at Therrell, and their names and ages have not been released.

Two brothers who were leaving the high school told the Atlanta Journal Constitution they saw about 20 people running away, before hearing at least five gunshots.

The brothers headed to a gas station where they asked a driver to call 911.

A spokesman for Grady Hospital, where the victims were taken, released a statement on Tuesday evening.

'Grady's Marcus Trauma Center received five patients this afternoon from a shooting in Southwest Atlanta. At this time four patients are listed as stable, one patient is still being evaluated,' it said.
