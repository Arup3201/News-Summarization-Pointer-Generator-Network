As if travelling at Christmas wasn’t stressful enough.

Ryanair has now unveiled a festive version of its notoriously annoying on-time jingle.

Passengers travelling on the budget airline over Christmas will be treated to a blast of trumpets accompanied by a New Year message when their planes arrive on schedule.

It has been created to replace the current bugle blast played over the aircraft’s tannoy system when the flights arrive on time.

The airline expect to carry 3.5million passengers over the Christmas period.

The music is accompanied a message that says: ‘Happy Christmas from all of us at Ryanair.

‘We wish you and your family a healthy and prosperous New Year. See you on board in 2015.’

The new landing music has been unveiled in a festive video made by the airline’s staff.

The video was shot at Ryanair’s Dublin HQ and features employees from the company dancing to the music.

On time: Ryanair plays the First Call bugle blast every time one of its flights arrives on schedule

There is even a cameo role from Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O’Leary, who jokingly despairs at the music.

Passengers thought they would soon be hearing the end of the jingle after the airline announced it was scrapping the bugle blast following an online survey.

It was in May this year that the flier gave in to people power after holding a vote via Twitter over whether or not to keep the annoying refrain, whose official name is First Call and is used in the army.

Customers overwhelmingly voted to ditch the tune, a taped version of which is played over the speakers each time a flight lands on time.

Over the years, customers of the Dublin-based carrier have regularly complained labelling the end of flight bugle call as 'annoying' or 'cheesy'.

Huge criticism: Ryanair asked on Twitter whether it should stop playing the noise on flights that land on time

Ryanair said it would drop the bugle following the Twitter vote, but have now announced they will replace it with another tune next year.

The move to drop the bugle comes as part of a massive charm offensive to change the airline's famously belligerent attitude to criticism.

It has also followed some of its budget rivals by allowed allocated seating, fewer restrictions on luggage and an improved website for bookings.

Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said in a statement: 'We asked our followers on Twitter to vote on whether we should change it.

'The people have spoken and after hundreds of votes, they've voted for change, so we're looking forward to unveiling our next customer improvement soon.'
