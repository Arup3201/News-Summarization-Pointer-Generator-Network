Bruno Peres, scorer of what could turn out to be the goal of the season, wasn't joking when he claimed of exhaustion after a lung-busting run on Sunday.

The Torino right back picked up possession inside his own box against Juventus with not an awful lot on.

Peres looked up, jinked beyond Paul Pogba and set about charging towards halfway, knocking the ball past another Juve midfielder.

The Juventus defence had backed off too far as Peres approached their box with the score 1-0

Then the space opened up, the 24-year-old Brazilian being backed off by home defenders as he approached the box unchallenged.

Obviously tired after his 80-yard sprint, Peres let fly from the edge of the box and screeched his effort beyond the despairing Marco Storari before trotting to the corner flag to celebrate with the visiting fans in the Turin derby.

That put Torino level at the time, but they went on to lose against 10-man Juventus thanks in no small part to Andrea Pirlo's stunning late effort.

But it was Peres' extraordinary solo run which stole the headlines.

'When I reached midfield, I already felt exhausted, as it was raining hard and the pitch was heavy,' Peres said.

'Then I remembered the words of our coach, who asked us all to pounce on opportunities to hurt Juventus.

'I thank God for the goal, but unfortunately we lost the match. Once Juve had gone down to 10 men, we tried to go on to win it, but knew this was going to be tough.'
