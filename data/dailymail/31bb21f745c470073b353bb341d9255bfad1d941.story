Jeffrey Epstein demanded a 'constant influx' of nubile teenagers to please him and his wealthy friends - but would have turned anyway anybody black, it has been claimed.

The billionaire financier's supposed sexual preferences were revealed by the woman who claims that she was his teenage sex slave - and was forced to sleep with Prince Andrew as part of her servitude.

Virginia Roberts, now 30, described life as one of his harem in a conversation with lawyers, which was filed to a court in Palm Beach, Florida, according to Page Six.

The woman, who says she was forced to sleep with the British royal aged 17, said: 'There was a constant influx of girls coming in and going out. And we were all very young'.

Going into more detail about what marked the girls out for selection, she said: Young, pretty, you know, a fun personality. They couldn’t be black'.

She added that any non-white girls would have to be 'exotically beautiful' even to be considered.

Roberts also said that Epstein would sleep with as many as seven girls per day - and that some were only 12 years old.

The woman, who now lives in Australia where she has three children, has made explosive claims about Epstein and Prince Andrew in connection with a federal case being heard in Palm Beach, Florida.

In the court papers she alleges that between 1999 and 2002 she 'was forced to have sexual relations with this prince when she was a minor' in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein where an orgy took place.

She has also described their first encounter, which began with her pouring a bath for the prince.

In a diary recently unveiled by Radar Online, she wrote: 'The room quickly filled with steam from the hot water as I turned to Andrew and began to kiss his neck and undress him.

'He was caressing every part of my naked body and filling my head with endless compliments about my blossoming figure.'

However, she said the sex itself was 'short-lived' and that he dressed and departed soon after.

Epstein's legal team are desperate to keep details of the trial secret - including the details of a 2008 plea deal he struck with prosecutors.

But the judge in the case has said he may make the documents public despite his protestations.

Judge Kenneth Marra, of the Southern District of Florida, has ordered Epstein to explain why the conditions of the negotiation should remained hidden.

He said: 'Public policy favors judicial records being open to the public', and said that unless Epstein could prove his case was 'extraordinary', they would be published.

Under the 2008 deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting sex with a minor and was sentenced to 18 months in jail, of which he served 13. He had been accused of sexually abusing as many as 40 young women.

Epstein has also been linked to Britain's Prince Andrew and prominent U.S. attorney Alan Dershowitz, who were accused in a court filing last month of having sex with an underage girl they met through Epstein.

Dershowitz, who represented Epstein in the 2008 criminal case, has denied the allegations, as have Buckingham Palace officials.

Some of Epstein's alleged victims are now seeking to have the plea overturned in a lawsuit in the Florida court before Judge Marra, saying that it violated their rights.

In October, Epstein asked Marra to keep under seal correspondence between prosecutors and his lawyers related to the plea deal.

In Thursday's order, however, Marra said he would only seal the correspondence if Epstein could show 'extraordinary circumstances or particularized needs' that justified doing so.

Epstein's legal team plans to file a brief early next week laying out its argument in favor of keeping the documents sealed, Epstein attorney Martin Weinberg said Friday.
