Beautiful, talented and immensely successful, American photographer Lee Miller was the fashion muse turned war correspondent who fired the imagination of generations of photographers.

Famous for her harrowing images documenting the horrors of World War Two, her photo-journalistic work for Vogue included striking shots of the skeletal inmates of Dachau and Buchenwald concentration camps as well as portraits of the men fighting in the US army.

But following the war, and although dogged by post-traumatic stress disorder, Miller began a new career documenting some of the leading lights of the art world.

Now, the Lee Miller archive has released a batch of never-before-seen images that include some of the greats of modern art, including intimate shots of Joan Miró relaxing with a python at London Zoo and Jean Cocteau lighting a fellow diner’s cigarette during a supper in Paris.

A leading light of the 1950’s art set, Miller’s post-war career produced some of the most iconic images of artists such as Picasso, Henry Moore and Eileen Agar available today.

But the new images display an altogether softer side of her personality, and show why the celebrated war photographer’s home became such a Mecca for artists during the 50s and 60s.

Among regular visitors to Farley Farm House in Sussex were Picasso, Man Ray, Henry Moore, Eileen Agar, Jean Dubuffet, Dorothea Tanning, and Max Ernst.

During this period, Miller also produced photographs for her husband Roland Penrose’s biographies of Picasso and the Spanish sculptor and painter, Antoni Tàpies.

Many of these works can be seen in the Lee Miller archive, which consists of more than 60,000 original negatives, 20,000 prints and contact sheets, and thousands of original documents and manuscripts.

Set up by Miller’s only son, Anthony Penrose to preserve and collate her work, in the wake of her death in 1977, many of the photos contained in the archive can now be seen online, thanks to Penrose’s newly relaunched website which includes a library containing 3,000 of Miller’s works.

More of her work can be seen at Farley Farm House, where the photographer spent her later years and launched her third career – this time as a gourmet cook.

The house, and Miller’s beloved herb garden, is to be opened to the public every Sunday between April and October.

The Penrose family, who still own the property, have also converted one of the barns into a gallery which will champion new artistic talent, just as Miller and Penrose did half a century ago.
