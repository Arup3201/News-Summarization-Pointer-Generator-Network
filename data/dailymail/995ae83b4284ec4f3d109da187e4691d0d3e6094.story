Tourists on board a cruise ship trapped in ice in Antarctica spent Christmas day consoling one another after learning that rescue was several days away.

The Russian-built ship, MV Akademik Shokalskiy, has about 50 passengers and 20 crew members on board but apart from frustrations all were said to be safe.

The ice-strengthened ship, built in 1982, was originally used for oceanographic research before being refurbished to be used as a passenger vessel in the Arctic and Antarctica.

There are around 70 passengers and crew stuck on the MV Akademik Shokalskiy after it got stuck in ice in the Antarctic

Australia's Maritime Safety Authority, which is now controlling the rescue operation, received a distress call early today saying that the vessel was trapped in thick ice and would need help to move.

Until rescue vessels arrive, it will not be known whether the passengers would have to be taken off the ship and moved out of the area on larger vessels.

It was not immediately known how long the ship has been trapped, surrounded by ice floes.

A spokeswoman for the safety authority told Australia's Associated Press that three ships were on their way to the stricken vessel.

But it will be at least two days before the nearest ship will be able to reach the remote location, some 1,500 nautical miles south of Hobart.

'It is quite a remote part of the world,' said the spokesman. 'But we have everyone safe. The vessel isn't in any immediate danger.'

The spokeswoman said the ship was on a research expedition to commemorate the centenary of Australian geologist Douglas Mawson's exploration of Antarctica.

The vessel was visiting a number of sites along the edge of Antarctica.

The nationalities of the tourists have not been revealed, but they are known to include scientists and explorers.

One has managed to send a tweet.

Chris Turney, of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, wrote: 'Heavy ice. Beautiful; light wind. Only -1degC. All well. Merry Xmas everyone from AAE.'
