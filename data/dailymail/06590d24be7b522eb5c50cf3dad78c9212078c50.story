Russia could seize the whole of Ukraine in three days, Nato’s supreme military commander warned yesterday.

US Air Force General Philip Breedlove said Vladimir Putin has built up a force on Ukraine’s borders that is big enough for a full-blown invasion and ‘ready to go’.

He spoke as diplomatic concerns grew over the Russian strongman’s failure to pull his forces back after seizing Crimea – despite pledging to do so.

But intelligence chiefs warned Nato that
 the 40,000 troops on the border could invade the rest of Ukraine within
 12 hours of a Kremlin order.

General Breedlove said: ‘This is a very 
large and very capable and very ready force.’

Vladimir Putin sent troops into Crimea after Moscow-backed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich was toppled in February

He said it had aircraft and 
helicopter support, field hospitals and electronic warfare capabilities –
 ‘the entire suite that would be required to successfully have an 
incursion into Ukraine, should the decision be made’.

He added: ‘We think it is ready to go and we think it could accomplish its objectives in between three and five days.’

Russia said it regretted the tone of Nato’s comments as a throwback to the Cold War.

‘The language . . . rather resembles the verbal jousting of the Cold War era,’ foreign ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said.

Russia has said it will not invade Ukraine, but Mr Putin sent troops into Crimea after Moscow-backed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich was toppled in February. He has said he will protect ethnic Russians in nearby countries.

There have been pro-Russian demonstrations across east Ukraine, with crowds asking to be saved from ‘fascists’ they say have taken over in Kiev.

Moscow wants these areas to have more autonomy, a move bitterly rejected by the new government, which says it would break up Ukraine.  

General Breedlove warned that Moscow 
might seek to invade eastern Ukraine, establish a land corridor to 
Crimea, seize the Black Sea port of Odessa or even seize land to connect
 Russia to Transdniestria, the mainly Russian-speaking, separatist 
region of Moldova to the west of Ukraine.

Nato foreign ministers meeting in Brussels this week asked military commanders to draw up plans to reinforce Nato members in Eastern Europe.

Nato will hold joint exercises with countries in the area and is looking at the readiness of its rapid reaction force.

Its Secretary General Mr Rasmussen said: ‘If Russia were to intervene further in Ukraine, I wouldn’t hesitate to call it an historic mistake. That would lead to further international isolation of Russia.

‘It would have far reaching consequences
 for the relations between Russia and . . . the Western world. It would 
be a miscalculation with huge strategic implications.’

The warnings came as Viktor Yanukovich announced he was ‘wrong’ to invite Russian troops into Crimea. The ousted president said he has met with Mr Putin and still hopes to see him hand the region back.

‘Crimea is a tragedy, a major tragedy,’ he said. ‘We must . . . search for ways to return to Crimea on any conditions.’

Russia annexed Crimea last month following a rushed  referendum held after Russian troops took the region. Ukraine and the West have rejected the move as illegal.
