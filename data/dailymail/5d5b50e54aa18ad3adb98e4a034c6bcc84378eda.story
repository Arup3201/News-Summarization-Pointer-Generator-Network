A 7ft 2in criminal has been released from custody after a judge accepted prison beds and uniforms were too small for him.

Jude Medcalf, 23, of Newton Abbot, Devon, committed a spate of crimes after being diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome, a rare growth disorder which means he is still growing.

He terrified an innocent woman by firing a BB gun at her through a window, and then went on to steal £30 of Christmas presents and £20 tea money from an NHS office, Exeter Crown Court heard.

Medcalf was later found with stolen food - including a large amount of rump steak, which was taken from The Sloop pub in Newton Abbot while it was open and staff were distracted, the court was told.

He was freed from jail after the court was told he had already spent 75 days in custody. He had faced problems throughout his time in custody because there were no beds or uniforms to fit him.

Medcalf - who has also been diagnosed with a chromosomal disorder that gives him adolescent emotions – got a six-month curfew and 12-month community order after being held on remand. 

Brian Fitzherbert, prosecuting, said that when Medcalf saw his girlfriend calling the police after he had attacked an acquaintance's car in Torquay, he fired the BB gun at her, which cracked a window.

‘The woman was left feeling very frightened,’ Mr Fitzherbert said. ‘When the gun was pointed at her she did not know it was not real and feared for her life.’

Medcalf admitted possession of an imitation firearm and a bladed article, criminal damage and burglary at an earlier hearing. He had been remanded in custody for sentencing.

William Parkhill, defending

William Parkhill, defending, said Medcalf had been unable to access the specialist medical and psychiatric treatment he needed since his ‘tragic’ diagnosis.

He said: ‘He has spent 75 days in prison on remand and he is not somebody who copes well because of the physical aspects in terms of accommodation, bedding and clothing.

‘He is also a target because he is big
 enough to be seen as someone who it is impressive to assault, but 
immature enough that he cannot deal with it.

‘He has been targeted twice and had a black eye the last time he came to court.’

Confined: A typical prison cell, with a bed that would be deemed too small for Medcalf

Recorder Adam Vaitilingam QC said he was 
tempted to pass a lengthy jail sentence, but he accepted Medcalf ‘had a 
lot of difficulty in life’, and that his condition had caused people to 
pick on him.

Klinefelter syndrome was first diagnosed in 1942 by Dr Harry Klinefelter at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

Victims often develop enlarged breasts, have sparse facial and body hair, small testes, and an inability to produce sperm.

Men with the condition often grow to 6ft or 6ft 2in, but the Klinefelter Syndrome Association said it knows only of two men - including Medcalf - with it who have grown to 7ft.

Sufferers tend to have gender issues because they have an extra chromosome, which is a woman's chromosome. They also suffer from skeletal difficulties - problems with their bones.

Mr Vaitilingam told the defendant: ‘You have had chances in the past and not taken them so the temptation is to pass a lengthy sentence.

‘I have taken into account the 75 days you have already spent in custody and accept that you have had a difficult time for the reasons your solicitor has explained.

‘In the pre-sentence report the probation service argue strongly for a non-custodial sentence and point out you have had a lot of difficulty in life.

‘You have recently been diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome, which has no doubt caused you problems throughout your life with people picking on you.’

Sue Cook, national coordinator at the Klinefelter Syndrome Association, said after the sentencing: ‘Sufferers develop a very aggressive side and a few do get into trouble with the law.

‘If someone has the condition, this should definitely be taken into account when sentencing. Klinefelter Syndrome is not rare. It is very common. It affects one in 600 live births.'

A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: 'The appeal against the decision of the district judge has been withdrawn as we did not serve notice of the appeal on the defence within the strict time limits necessary.'
