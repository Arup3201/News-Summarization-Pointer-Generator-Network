Dave King has insisted he was confident about brokering a £16million funding package for Rangers after arriving in Glasgow to hold talks with Ibrox directors.

The Castlemilk-based businessman flew from his home in South Africa to London early on Tuesday morning before heading north.

His face-to-face meeting with members of the Rangers board, including chairman David Somers and chief executive Graham Wallace, came after 72 hours in which negotiations between the two sides had intensified.

Asked if he was optimistic a deal could be agreed as he left Ibrox yesterday evening, King replied: ‘Yes, we are.’

Rangers officials declined to comment.

Sportsmail last week revealed details of the King-led plan now being presented to the cash-strapped club, who are on course to run out of funds before the end of the year.

He is the key player in an alliance of investors – also featuring former director Paul Murray and shareholder George Letham – who are offering an initial £16m in return for a 51 per cent stake acquired via a new share issue.

For that to happen, the group require the board to recommend their plan and include it as a resolution at the AGM, which must take place before the end of December. It would then need the backing of 75 per cent of existing shareholders for the share issue to proceed.

The situation is further complicated by Mike Ashley’s ongoing move to oust Wallace and Philip Nash as directors. Both are favourable towards King’s proposal.

Newcastle United owner Ashley recently increased his stake in Rangers to 8.9 per cent and has called for an EGM to shake-up the board. The club remain in the process of verifying that request and have yet to confirm any date for the proposed meeting.

Losing Wallace and Nash from the board would be a huge blow to the King group but it remains a possibility that they could seek a form of truce with Ashley.

The Sports Direct billionaire already has significant commercial interests at Ibrox through his retail contracts and could feasibly call off his EGM move if he was persuaded there is no threat to his financial position at the club.
