Schoolfriends Nathan Wilkins and Kyle Robson have always been close - but their latest escapade brought them closer than ever.

Medics had to free the two friends who 'bonded' during class when they accidentally superglued their hands together in an arm-wrestling contest.

Nathan, 13, and Kyle, 14, both of Hartlepool, were in a music lesson at High Tunstall College of Science when another student brought out a tube of pink glue. The substance was squirted onto Kyle's hand, who then challenged Nathan to an arm wrestle.

But within seconds, the Year Nine pupils found themselves in a sticky situation.

Nathan and Kyle both of Hartlepool, were in a music lesson when another student brought out a tube of pink glue. The substance was squirted onto Kyle's hand, who then challenged Nathan to an arm wrestle

At first their teacher did not believe them but soon realised the pair could not be freed.

School staff contacted the boys' parents at 10am, with Nathan's mother, Chris Coxon, 46, arranging for transport to take boys to the One Life Hartlepool out of hours health centre.

Once there, staff and nurses giggled as they tried to un-stick the teenagers.

Staff at the centre tried nail varnish initially, but when it did not work, a medical guide was consulted and they tried hot soapy water.

After steeping their hands in the water for about half-an-hour, Nathan, 13, and Kyle, 14, both of Hartlepool, managed to pull their hands apart.

The pair were back at school by lunchtime the same day.

Ms Coxon, a carer and cleaner, said: 
'I couldn't believe it when the school rang to say they were glued 
together and could I drop everything to go and get them.

'I
didn't believe what I was hearing at first.Â  I thought surely not, but 
then when I saw them they were completely stuck together!

After trying to free the boys from each other with nail varnish remover, medical centre staff used the simple, old fashioned method of hot soapy water to do the trick

'I couldn't get over it. I was saying to them, 'are you sure you're not lying?' but they weren't . They couldn't take their hands apart.

'Some girl had stuck some pink glue on one of their hands and then as lads do, messing about, they had an arm wrestle and the next thing you know they were stuck together.

'My dad drove me to the school to get them and take them to the One Life. I had to help them in the van and put the seat belt right across the pair of them because it was both of their right hands that were glued.'

The mother-of-five said Nathan has always been accident prone after splitting his chin open, breaking his heel and then his arm in separate incidents over the years.

She added: 'The staff had a right laugh at them and they had to read to find out what would take it off.

'Then they put their hands in scalding hot water with soap for a good 30 minutes before they were eventually freed.'

Mark Tilling, headteacher of High Tunstall College of Science, said: 'Two Year 9 students had to be taken to the One Life Centre on Tuesday after their hands were glued together following a prank in school.

'Medical staff were able to free their hands and no injuries were sustained. The school dealt promptly with the incident and has taken appropriate action.'
