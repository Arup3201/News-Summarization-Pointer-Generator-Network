As many as a quarter of teenagers abuse their boyfriend or girlfriend, according to a study published today.

Almost half of the young people interviewed also said that they had been abused in their relationships, leading experts to demand that the Government take action.

The abuse ranges from emotional abuse, for example controlling where a girlfriend or boyfriend can go, to physical and even sexual assault.

Abuse: The study, which surveyed 1,203 children aged 13-14, found that almost half had experienced physical, emotional or sexual abuse (photo posed by model)

The findings are the result of a survey of 1,203 schoolchildren carried out as part of a major project examining attitudes to domestic abuse in young people.

The three-year From Boys to Men study, led by Professor David Gadd of the University of Manchester, also found that some children thought that it was acceptable to hit your partner in some circumstances.

Around 17 per cent of boys asked said it was alright to hit your girlfriend if she hit you first, and 11.5 per cent of girls agreed.

A notable minority said that it was alright to hit a boyfriend or girlfriend when he or she hit out first, or if they found out their partner had been unfaithful

Both boys and girls thought it was more acceptable for a girl to hit a boy than vice versa.

The From Boys to Men project surveyed 1,203 schoolchildren aged 13-14, and found that:

The study also looks at how young people refer to domestic abuse - and found out that young people were much more likely to use gentler terms such as 'put downs' or 'fights' to refer to incidents of abuse.

In-depth interviews with young men who abused their girlfriends were particularly likely to refers to their actions as 'fights', which they were not prepared to 'lose' for fear of seeming weak.

Interviews with abusers found that many of them would say that domestic abuse was unacceptable in general, but find excuses when asked about their own actions.

Professor Gadd said: 'For these 
groups of young men, many of whom are already outside mainstream 
schooling, there are limits to what curriculum based learning can do.  A
more comprehensive programme of intervention is needed.

'The
experience of living with fathers who have been cruel and sadistic, 
makes it harder for them to recognise what they see as less calculating 
forms of violence as abuse.

'And
some of those who have behaved in controlling ways towards partners 
are, nevertheless, desperate not to become the kinds of abusive men 
their fathers were.

Shocking: The above statistics show how many of the 1,203 pupils surveyed have been abused by boyfriends or girlfriends

Hurt: 17 per cent of teenagers surveyed had experienced physical abuse (photo posed by model)

'While
I have been conducting research in this area for 15 years, I would 
still struggle to know where best to refer a young man who was beginning
to behave in an abusive way to a partner or other family members.

'While
most young men will say domestic violence is wrong, few actually know 
how to challenge other people who are abusive without resorting to 
violence.

'For this 
reason, child protection services need to also anticipate the ongoing 
challenges fatherhood  and intimate relationships present to young men 
who have grown up around abuse, neglect and addiction problems.'
