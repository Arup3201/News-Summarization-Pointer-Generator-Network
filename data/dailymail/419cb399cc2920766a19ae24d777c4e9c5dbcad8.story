There were call-ups for three uncapped players and an unexpected recall for Ben Stokes but they were all overshadowed in England's Test squad to tour the Caribbean by the return of Jonathan Trott.

Nothing seemed less likely than this when Trott left England's Ashes tour 16 months ago after his public ordeal at the hands of Mitchell Johnson.

The road back since he returned home after the first Test in Brisbane with a 'stress-related condition' later diagnosed as situational anxiety has been a long and tortuous one.

Yet against all the odds and after the key development of working with renowned sports psychologist Steve Peters, Trott is back and will compete with Adam Lyth to become Alastair Cook's opening partner in the three-Test series.

There will be those who worry about Trott's fragility but mental injuries should be treated no differently from physical ones and now he has been given a clean bill of health it is right that the 33-year-old should be picked.

Lyth gets the nod ahead of Sam Robson and his emerging county colleague Alex Lees, and becomes one of an incredible six Yorkshiremen in the squad after scoring 1,489 championship runs at 67.68 last season.

Adil Rashid, another Yorkshireman, and Durham fast bowler Mark Wood are the other newcomers.

Rashid made the last of his 10 limited-overs appearances for England six years ago but is a more mature leg-spinning all-rounder and person now at 27. Stokes, who missed out on the World Cup after a miserable year of form, returns in place of the injured Chris Woakes, but England see him more as a No 6 batsman and fourth seamer in Test cricket.

England hope Moeen Ali will overcome a side injury to join the tour in time for the second Test in Grenada. In his absence Rashid will compete for the No 1 slow-bowling spot with Kent's reliable off-spinner James Tredwell, who edged out Surrey's Zafar Ansari for the final place in the squad.
