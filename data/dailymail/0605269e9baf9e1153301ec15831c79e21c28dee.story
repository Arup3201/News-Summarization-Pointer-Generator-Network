A bagel shop worker was given a Christmas to remember after her customers and co-workers banded together to buy her a car so she would no longer have to walk to work.

Shirley Ratliff, 47, had been walking several miles every day so she could get to get to a bus stop and ride to work at Bruegger's Bagels in Raleigh, North Carolina.

So to ease her burden, the group of loyal customers and colleagues - calling themselves 'Shirley's Fan Club' – presented the worker with a 1992 Buick LeSabre as a Christmas gift.

Shirley, who has been serving at the shop since 2006, had tried to save money for a car, but she was diagnosed with cervical cancer a few years ago and experienced a financial setback, the News Observer reported.

'I've never had a whole lot of money anyway, and every now and then something happens,' she told the newspaper.

So with Christmas approaching, loyal customer David Burton bought a car for $1,500 and then asked other regulars and co-workers if they could chip in.

'When I asked for people to contribute, they didn't even blink,' he said.

'She had been riding the bus for years and years and years and I know she was looking for a car,' Burton told WNCN. 

'So she had a health issue that kind of set her back and I decided to try to fix that problem for her.'

Shirley was overwhelmed by the gift, which means she no longer has to walk several miles to get to work

Most of the bagel shop's regular customers knew about Shirley's long journey to work, which involved either three buses or a lengthy walk. 

Burton presented the car and a gasoline card to a clearly emotional Shirley in front of a group of 20 or so customers and co-workers who had contributed to the gift. 

He said: 'We wanted to show you how much you make our day. When we come here every morning you're always in a good mood, you're always smiling.'

'This is the best Christmas present I ever had,' Shirley said. 'All my friends are here, and I see that now. I knew it before, but now I really know.'
