It's got three bedrooms and a new modern design along with a generously sized outdoor space.

But it's the real estate agent's six-pack that's likely to catch the attention of house-hunters looking at a Riverside property in Barwon Heads, south west of Melbourne.

Levi Turner, of Bellarine Property, excited future home-owners after he ditched the suit, donned a pair of board shorts and whipped his shirt off for a video advertising a Challis Lane property.

Forget the three bedrooms, it's estate agent Lev Turner's six-pack that house-hunters are focused on in this property add

Starting with an aerial shot of Mr Turner as he walks up from the shore and grabs his towel off the sand, a drone follows him as he sprints up the beach and along a road leading to the house.

'The Barwon River: what an amazing place to enjoy…imagine if this was on your doorstep only 100m away from your home,' Mr Turner is heard saying.

But forget the home's interior, the rest of the video shows a close-up of a shirtless Mr Turner with a towel thrown over his shoulder, telling viewers about the home's location.

The agency's managing director, Christian Bartley, told Daily Mail Australia that the video has proved a great success.

'There have been lot of jokes circulating about how many girls will be calling us about inspecting the property,' Mr Bartley jested.

'We've got 11 people that have shown interest in the property that want contracts and we've only been on the market for 14 days. Normally you'd have maybe zero to one contracts after only two weeks.'

A drone filmed the Bellarine Property agent running up the sand towards the property in an effort to show its proximity to the Barwon River in Victoria 

Sprinting up the road,  it's not the first time an agent from the group has chosen to strip-off his clothes in an attempt to sell the house

He also revealed that he'd gone to the extreme of stripping off some clothes to sell the same house himself.  

'I sold this current property to the current owners in 2006 and when I did that, I auctioned it off and I took my pants off,' Mr Bartley said.

'That was for the purpose of demonstrating how close it was to the river: I mimicked that I was going to run to the river afterwards as a joke to the buyers.'

He sold the property while wearing just a pair of board shorts and the same buyers, who are selling the home nine years later, requested that he flash some skin for the sake of a sale a second time.

'When I got appointed to the sale of this house again, from the owners who bought it from me last time, they requested that I auction it and asked if I would get my pants off again,' Mr Bartley said.

'I need to do something innovative and different - that's why they've appointed me to represent them, they want me grab the attention of the market.' 

'Because it's so close - literally 60 seconds form the river - I wanted to showcase that through a video and I wanted it all filmed within a minute.

'The proximity of the river to the house - to showcase that through photos , it just can't be done like that, even aerial images.'
