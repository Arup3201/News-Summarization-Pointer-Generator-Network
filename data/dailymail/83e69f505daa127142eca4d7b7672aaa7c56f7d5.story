Joe Biden added a page to his lengthy book of gaffes on Thursday night, mocking the plight of overlooked vice presidents everywhere by asking a Harvard University audience, 'Isn't it a b**ch?'

During a speaking appearance at Harvard's Institute of Politics, senior Sietse Goffard rose to ask a question and first noted that 'I’m the vice president of the student body here.'

'Isn't it a b**ch,' Biden quipped. 'I mean – excuse me – the vice president thing?'

Amid laughter, he quickly backpedaled from the latest in his long string of public blunders.

'Isn't that a b**ch,' Biden ask Harvard University's student body vice-president. 'I mean – excuse me – the vice president thing?'

Harvard senior economics major Sietse Goffard guffawed when Biden sympatized with his second-banana syndrome

'I’m joking, I’m joking,' he insisted. 'Best decision I ever made.'

'That was a joke. That was a joke,' Biden said of his colorful take on always being second.

Goffard told him: 'I hope you love your job.'

'I do actually,' Biden responded. 'I love that guy I work with.'

Biden, a rumored 2016 presidential candidate, is a walking gaffe top-ten list known for his mastery of the inappropriate and flat-out wrong.

During this summer's U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, he told Africa's heads of state that their continent was actually a country. 

​'There's no reason the nation of Africa cannot and should not join the ranks of the world's most prosperous nations in the near term,' he said.

And Thursday night wasn't the public's first glimpse of his more colorful vocabulary. Biden famously told President Barack Obama during a White House ceremony that his Affordable Care Act law was 'a big f***ing deal' – a comment that his lapel mic caught and broadcast nationwide.

Four years ago he noted in a diplomatic face-palm moment how Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen's mother had 'lived in Long Island for ten years or so' before her death.

'God rest her soul,' Biden said somberly, before realizing that 'wait – your mom’s still ... your mom’s still alive. Your dad passed. God bless her soul.'

In 2012 he made the sign of the cross while on stage to address a group of more than 1,600 conservative rabbis in Atlanta.

Reporters guffawed later that year when he tried to capture the spirit of President Theodore Roosevelt's famous 'Speak softly' philosophy, by noting that 'the president has a big stick. I promise you.'

Biden spoke to a capacity crowd at left-leaning Harvard on Thursday night, answering questions at the Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge, Mass.

It brought back memories of a 2008 photo-op outside Biden's home where he told journalists that he had just returned from 'a successful dump,' which turned out to be a trip to a nearby landfill.

Two months later during an Ohio campaign speech, Biden criticized then-GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain for what he called a 'last-minute economic plan' that did 'nothing to tackle the number-one job facing the middle class.'

'It happens to be, as Barack says, a three-letter word: jobs. J-O-B-S, jobs.'

Several of Biden's most cringe-worthy moments have riled conservatives who say their own political stars would have been pilloried in print and on television if they had made similar comments.

'You cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent,' he told an Indian-American man in 2006, with a C-SPAN camera rolling.

'I'm not joking.'
