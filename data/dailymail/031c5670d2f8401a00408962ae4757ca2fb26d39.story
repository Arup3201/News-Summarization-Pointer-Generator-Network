Brazil World Cup winner Ronaldo was left to wash the dishes at London's Hippodrome Casino on Tuesday, after losing a charity game of poker to tennis star Rafael Nadal.

The duo battled it out on the PokerStars table for a whopping $50,000 and it was Nadal that emerged victorious with a donation for the Rafa Nadal foundation.

To celebrate his victory, Nadal treated guests to a tapas banquet from his favourite Spanish restaurant, Cambio De Tercio.

But Ronaldo, who spearheaded the Brazil attack when they won the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea, was not left to enjoy his meal after being beaten by tennis legend Nadal.

He had to wash the dishes up after the guests had eaten as a forefeit for losing the game.

Nadal's tennis season ended early after requiring an appendix operation, which caused him to miss the ATP World Tour Finals in London.

Ronaldo, meanwhile, has been demonstrating on his Instagram account that he is back in the gym and has not lost all of the athletic touch that made him one of the most feared strikers in Europe during his paying days.
