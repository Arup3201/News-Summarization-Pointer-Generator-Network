Found: A body found washed up on a beach in 1995 has been identified as 17-year-old Cengiz Nuray

A body that washed up on a California beach nearly two decades ago has finally been identified as a missing Grateful Dead fan who vanished while following the band.

The decomposed remains were identified as belonging to Cengiz Nuray, 17, after the Pacific Grove police and the coroner's office sent its DNA  to a state laboratory. It matched Nuray's profile on the FBI's DNA index system.

The teenager had last been seen at Greyhound Rock Beach in Santa Cruz on April 24, 1995.

He told friends he was going for a walk and left his belongings behind but never returned.

The group had been following the Grateful Dead at the time, the Monterey Herald reported.

His mother, who lived in Santa Barbara at the time, filed a missing persons report. 

Nuray was considered a runaway and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children produced an image for what he might look like now, aged 37. 

But a few months after the missing person report was filed, a badly decomposed body was found down the coast near Asilomar Beach in Monterey Bay.

The remains, which were found around 35 miles from where Nuray was last seen, were known as a 'John Doe' because they were so badly decomposed.

Although tests in the 90s had failed to produce a match, his DNA was sent to be tested again last year and, thanks to advances in technology, it made a match on the FBI's database.

It is not clear how he ended up in the water.

His family has been notified.

'After almost 20 years, the family will finally have closure and 'John Doe' will be laid to rest,' Pacific Grove police said in a statement.
