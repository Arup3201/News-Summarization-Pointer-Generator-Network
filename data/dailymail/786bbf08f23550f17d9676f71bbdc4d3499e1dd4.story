A convicted pedophile and murderer who has been on death row for over 20 years has stopped a pharmacy from providing the drug that was to be used for his lethal injection - just one week out from his execution.

Michael Anthony Taylor, 47, filed a federal lawsuit against The Apothecary Shoppe - a compounding pharmacy in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that provides a made-to-order drug to the Missouri Department of Corrections, where Taylor will be put to death.

The claim argued that the drug would cause Taylor 'inhumane pain and suffering'.

Taylor - who pleaded guilty to abducting, raping and stabbing to death a 15-year-old Kansas City girl in 1989 at the age of 22 - was scheduled to be executed on February 26.

Execution drugs have become increasingly difficult to obtain because most major licensed drug makers have stopped selling pharmaceuticals for use in the death penalty.

Michael Anthony Taylor, 47, has been on death row in Missouri for over 20 years for abducting, raping and stabbing to death a 15-year-old girl, but has stopped an Oklahoma pharmacy from providing the drugs for his lethal injection on the grounds they would cause him 'inhumane pain'

The Apothecary Shoppe in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has agreed not to provide any drugs that would be used in the execution of Michael Taylor following a federal lawsuit. The Missouri Department of Corrections are said to use the compound pharmacy to source drugs for their lethal injections, after many pharmaceutical companies stopped providing drugs that would be used in lethal injections

Many states, like Missouri, have turned to compounding pharmacies, which manufacture drugs for individual clients.

Unlike major drug companies, compounding pharmacies are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

In his lawsuit, Taylor alleged that Missouri turned to The Apothecary Shoppe to supply compounded pentobarbital - a powerful prescription barbiturate, or sedative - because the only licensed manufacturer of the drug, Illinois-based Akorn Inc., refuses to provide it for lethal injections.

Taylor contends that several recent executions in which compounded pentobarbital was used showed it would likely cause 'severe, unnecessary, lingering and ultimately inhumane pain'.

His attorneys used the instance of Michael Lee Wilson, 38, who was executed at Oklahoma State Penitentiary on January 9.

Within 20 seconds of receiving the drug, Wilson is said to have said: 'I feel my whole body burning.'

Taylor's attorneys alleged the statement was consistent with the receipt of 'contaminated' pentobarbital.

Now, according to court documents filed late Monday, Wilson's lawyers have asked a judge to dismiss the case because The Apothecary Shoppe had 'agreed' not to prepare or provide any drug for use in Taylor's lethal injection.

The pharmacy also acknowledged it had not already provided any drug to the Missouri Department of Corrections for the execution, according to Taylor's attorney, Matt Hellman.

The only licensed manufacturer of the drug pentobarbital, Akorn Inc., which distributes it under the name Nembutal, refused to supply it for the means of lethal injection. The drug is a prescription sedative

The linchpin of Taylor's lawsuit was the January execution of Michael Lee Wilson, 38 (pictured), who is said to have screamed out in pain after being administered compounded pentobarbital

What remains unclear, however, is how the result will affect Taylor's planned execution.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon suggested last week the state had enough drugs for the lethal injection.

While refusing to say 'yes' or 'no', he twice said the Department of Corrections was prepared.

The Department of Corrections has refused to comment on the case or their use of pentobarbital, saying the ways in which prisoners are executed are not for public knowledge.

The Apothecary Shoppe has also declined to comment, saying that the orders they produce are confidential.

This is not the first time Taylor has contested the drugs used in his execution.

He was hours away from undergoing a lethal injection in 2006 when the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of execution over concerns about whether the state's 
three-drug method could violate the constitutional guarantee against 
cruel and unusual punishment.

Missouri has executed three men in the past three months, all of them using pentobarbital.

Missouri had previously used a three-drug execution protocol.
