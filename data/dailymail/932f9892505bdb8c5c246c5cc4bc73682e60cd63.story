Sandwich chain Subway may market itself as the healthy fast-food option, but its customers are not as fit as you might expect.

New research has found that the more branches of Subway a country has, the more likely its population is to be obese.

Nations with a high density of Subways - such as the U.S., Canada and Australia - have more people classified as being extremely overweight.

By contrast, countries like Norway and Japan where there are few of the sandwich franchises also have relatively low obesity rates.

The study, published in the journal Critical Public Health, blames global free trade for allowing international fast-food chains to dominate cuisine around the world.

It was revealed last week that despite its healthier image, Subway meals contain more salt and nearly as many calories as those from McDonald's.

However, the research published today does not single out Subway as particularly unhealthy, but instead uses it as a stand-in for all fast food, owing to its status as the world's largest restaurant chain.

Scientists found the country with by far the highest concentration of the sandwich restaurants was Australia with 21.65 per 100,000 residents, followed by the U.S. with 7.52 and Canada with 7.43.

These countries also had some of the highest rates of obesity, even after adjusting for other factors such as income, inequality, urbanisation, and motor-vehicle and internet use.

Healthy? Researchers blame trade liberalisation for the global spread of fast food such as Subway

However, the authors admitted they could not say for sure that the density of fast-food restaurants caused obesity, but merely that it was associated with it.

They also acknowledged their research did not take into account the time lag between the appearance of such restaurants and a given country's obesity epidemic, while the study was also limited to just 26 advanced economies and one fast-food chain.

Nevertheless, they insist the research is an important contribution to the understanding of obesity as a global problem.

They accuse groups such as the World Trade Organisation of contributing to obesity by encouraging exports of domestic goods, imports of foreign products and the opening of markets to foreign investment.

The researchers dub this process 'globesization', and claim it is linked to the increasing power of international food companies, supermarkets and fast-food restaurants.
