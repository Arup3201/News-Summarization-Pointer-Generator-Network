Sleeping through the night is the milestone that all new mothers hope their baby will reach - and millions of baby books are sold every year promising to deliver it.

Now a hilarious new pastiche entitled 'How To Stop Mummy Sleeping Through The Night' is at least providing some laughs for sleep-deprived parents.

The blog, imagined from a seven month old’s perspective, follows the style of manuals which order parents not to sway from their goal of getting their baby to Sleep Through The Night (STTN).

Exhausting: Dealing with fractious infants can be a tough gig - especially when you're getting just a few hours sleep a night

But instead it tells babies to stick with their goal of night feeding, urging: 'It's hard to see your Mummy upset over your crying. Just keep reminding yourself, it's for her own good.'

The blog imagines what a baby really thinks when at around the six month mark when many mothers are preparing to return to work and start various tactics to train their baby to sleep through.

It starts: 'OK, here’s my situation. My Mummy has had me for almost seven months.

'The first few months were great. I cried, she picked me up and fed me, anytime, day or night. Then something happened.

'Over the last few weeks, she has been trying to STTN (sleep through the night). At first, I thought it was just a phase, but it is only getting worse.

'I’ve talked to other babies, and it seems like it's pretty common after Mummies have had us for around six months.

'Here’s the thing: these Mummies don’t really need to sleep. It's just a habit. Many of them have had some 30 years to sleep and they just don’t need it anymore. So I am implementing a plan.'

Just as sleep training advocates like Gina Ford use cheerleading tactics to buoy on exhausted parents it continues: 'CONSISTENCY IS KEY!! If you let her STTN (sleep through the night), just once, she will expect it every night.

'I KNOW IT'S HARD! But she really doesn’t need the sleep, she’s just resisting the change.'

It also pokes fun at one tactic called 'shhh pat' - a softer approach from Tracey Hoggs a.k.a The Baby Whisperer, which is used by parents uncomfortable with controlled crying, and it claims dads are a soft touch.

'Sometimes my Mummy will call for reinforcements by sending in Daddy.

'Don’t worry, Daddies are not set up for not needing sleep the way Mummies are. They can only handle a few pats and shhing before they declare defeat and send in the Mummy.'

The post – which has 50,000 likes on Facebook has caught the imagination of tens of thousands of mothers, who have exclaimed that the is so accurate that it could have been penned by their own baby.

The sleep-stopping plan is even given a name – the Crybaby Shuffle.

No joke: Being kept awake by a crying baby for weeks on end is hard - but at least new mothers will be able to smile at the blog

One laugh out loud section reads: 'I cried for any reason I could come up with. My sleep sack tickled my foot. I felt a wrinkle under the sheet. My mobile made a shadow on the wall. I burped, and it tasted like pears. I hadn’t eaten pears since lunch, what’s up with that? The cat said 'meow'. I should know. My Mummy reminds me of this about 20 times a day. LOL.

'Once I cried just because I liked how it sounded when it echoed on the monitor in the other room. Too hot, too cold, just right - doesn’t matter! Keep crying!!

'I like to give Mummy 
false hope that listening to the rain puts me to sleep so sometimes I 
pretend to close my eyes and be asleep and then wait until I know Mummy 
is settling back to sleep to spring a surprise cry attack.

'If she 
doesn’t get to me fast enough I follow up with my fake cough and gag 
noise that always has her running to the crib.

'It took a while, but it worked. She fed me at 4am. Tomorrow night, my goal is 3:30am. You need to slowly shorten the interval between feedings in order to reset your Mummies internal clocks.'

The post appeared on Facebook group Katy's Breastfeeding Support - though this doesn't seem to be the original source, and the post has appeared on multiple parenting pages across the globe.

Many readers commented on the post saying they identified with it only too well.

'OK, here’s my situation. My Mummy has 
had me for almost seven months. The first few months were great. I cried, 
she picked me up and fed me, anytime, day or night.

Then something 
happened.

Over the last few weeks, she has been 
trying to STTN (sleep through the night). At first, I thought it was 
just a phase, but it is only getting worse.

I’ve talked to other babies,
and it seems like its pretty common after Mummies have had us for 
around six months.

Here’s the thing: these Mummies don’t 
really need to sleep. Its just a habit. Many of them have had some 30 
years to sleep and they just don’t need it anymore.

So I am implementing
a plan. I call it the Crybaby Shuffle. It goes like this:

Night 1: Cry every three hours until you get
fed. I know, its hard. Its hard to see your Mummy upset over your 
crying. Just keep reminding yourself, its for her own good.

Night 2: Cry every two hours until you get fed.

Night 3: [Cry] every hour. Most Mummies will 
start to respond more quickly after about three nights.

Some Mummies are 
more alert, and may resist the change longer. These Mummies may stand in
your doorway for hours, shhhh-ing.

Don’t give in. I cannot stress this 
enough: CONSISTENCY IS KEY!! If you let her STTN (sleep through the 
night), just once, she will expect it every night.

I KNOW ITS HARD! But 
she really doesn’t need the sleep, she’s just resisting the change.

If you have an especially alert Mummy, 
you can stop crying for about 10 minutes, just long enough for her to go
back to bed and start to fall asleep.

Then cry again. It WILL 
eventually work. My Mummy once stayed awake for 10 hours straight, so I 
know she can do it.

Last night, I cried every hour. You just have to 
decide to stick to it and just go for it. BE CONSISTENT!

I cried for any reason I could come up 
with. My sleep sack tickled my foot. I felt a wrinkle under the sheet. 
My mobile made a shadow on the wall.

I burped, and it tasted like pears.
I hadn’t eaten pears since lunch, what’s up with that? The cat said 'meow'. I should know. My Mummy reminds me of this about 20 times a day.
LOL.

Once I cried just because I liked how it sounded when it echoed on
the monitor in the other room.

Too hot, too cold, just right - doesn’t 
matter! Keep crying!! It took awhile, but it worked.

She fed me at 4am. 
Tomorrow night, my goal is 3:30am. You need to slowly shorten the 
interval between feedings in order to reset your Mummies internal 
clocks.

Sometimes my Mummy will call for 
reinforcements by sending in Daddy.

Don’t worry, Daddies are not set up 
for not needing sleep the way Mummies are. They can only handle a few 
pats and shhing before they declare defeat and send in the Mummy.

Also, be wary of the sleep sheep with 
rain noises. I like to give Mummy false hope that listening to the rain 
puts me to sleep sometimes I pretend to close my eyes and be asleep and 
then wait until I know Mummy is settling back to sleep to spring a 
surprise cry attack.

If she doesn’t get to me fast enough I follow up 
with my fake cough and gag noise that always has her running to the 
crib.

At some point I am positive she will start to realise that she really doesn’t really need sleep.

P.S. Don’t let those rubber things fool you, no matter how long you suck on them, no milk will come out. Trust me
