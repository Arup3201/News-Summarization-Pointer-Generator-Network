Astronomers have discovered stars forming in a remote region of the Milky Way not thought possible before.

The stars were seen in a cloud of molecular gas 16,000 light-years below the flattened disc of our galaxy - further than any others ever seen.

And if any planets were to form around these stars, inhabitants would see the entire glory of the spiral galaxy above them in their night sky.

Brazilian scientists have discovered remote stars forming in the Milky Way. They are the most distant stars ever to be seen forming in the galaxy. Shown is an image from Nasa’s Wise telescope of dust emissions, centred on the star cluster called Camargo 438. Some of the stars may be hidden by dust

The amazing discovery - led by Dr Denilso Camargo of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre, Brazil - marks the first time that star-forming clusters that are part of the Milky Way have been found this far from our galaxy.

‘This is the first time astronomers have found stars being born in such a remote location,’ said Dr Camargo.

‘Our work shows that the space around the galaxy is a lot less empty than we thought.’

Previously, it was only thought possible for stars to form inside giant molecular clouds (GMC) located in the inner part of the galactic disc.

The Milky Way is thought to be 120,000 light years across and contains more than 200 billion stars.

This makes it a ‘middleweight’ galaxy with the largest galaxy known, IC 1101, containing more than 100 trillion stars.

On a clear night, when you look up into the night sky, the most you can see from any one point on the Earth is about 2,500 stars.

Like more than two-thirds of the known galaxies, the Milky Way has a spiral shape.

At the centre of the spiral, a lot of energy and, occasionally, vivid flares are created.

And also at the centre is a supermassive black hole, known as Sagittarius A*. 

Astronomers believe the Milky Way wasn’t always a stunning barred spiral, though. It may have formed into its current size by ‘eating’ other galaxies. 

Within these clumps, many stars are born together in clusters.

Using Nasa’s orbiting Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (Wise) telescope, Dr Camargo and his team discovered several GMCs above and below the disc of our Milky Way.

But they were shocked to find that one GMC 16,000 light-years from the galactic centre contained two clusters of stars forming.

Their location is towards the outer limits of our galaxy - far enough that they would see the entire splendour of its spiral above them, but not so far that they are not classified as being in the Milky Way.

From the position of Earth in the Milky Way, the galaxy appears flat, with most of its material surrounding the supermassive black hole at its centre.

The new clusters are named Camargo 438 and 439, reported the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS), and are located within the molecular cluster known as HRK 81.4-77.8.

The cloud is thought to be about two million years old, and is located towards the constellation of Cetus.

The new clusters are named Camargo 438 (left) and 439 (right), reported the Royal Astronomical Society, and are located within the molecular cluster known as HRK 81.4-77.8. Both of these images are 24 light-years across, and the black dots in the image are individual stars

If any planets are in orbit of the stars, this illustration is the view they would see of the Milky Way. The location of the clusters is towards the outer limits of our galaxy - far enough that they would see the entire splendour of its spiral above them, but not so far that they are not classified as being in the Milky Way

There are currently two theories explaining how stars came to be forming in this region so far from the Milky Way, where dust and gas is thought to be much less abundant.

One theory is known as the Chimney Model, which suggests that supernovae and other violent explosions ejected dust and gas out of the galactic disc, merging to form these GMCs.

This would have required several hundred massive stars to explode over several generations, creating a ‘superwind’ that moved HRK 81.4-77.8 to its present location.

Bubbles from these explosions would then lead to the creation of new stars within the cloud.

The other theory suggests that the interaction between the Milky Way and its satellite, known as the Magellanic Clouds, may have disturbed gas falling into the galaxy, giving rise to these distant clouds.

‘The new clusters of stars are truly exotic,’ said Dr Camargo, according to the RAS.

‘In a few million years, any inhabitants of planets around the stars will have a grand view of the outside of the Milky Way, something no human being will probably ever experience.

‘Now we want to understand how the ingredients for making stars made it to such a distant spot.

‘We need more data and some serious work on computer models to try to answer this question.’

One theory to how the stars came to be is known as the Chimney Model, which suggests that supernovae (illustration shown) and other violent explosions ejected dust and gas out of the galactic disc, merging to form these GMCs. Bubbles from these explosions would then lead to the creation of new stars

The discovery is the most distant example of star formation taking place in our galaxy. Many other closer such regions have been discovered before, such as the Coronet cluster, seen here, which is located about 500 light-years away. Young stars are seen forming in this infrared image taken by Nasa’s Spitzer telescope
