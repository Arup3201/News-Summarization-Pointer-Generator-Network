America is to pay the moon a visit for the first time since Apollo 17 touched down there more than 40 years ago.

The privately-owned MX-1 will blast off in 2015 on a reconnaissance mission ahead of plans to mine the moon for minerals.

The unmanned spacecraft, unveiled last night at the Autodesk University show in Las Vegas, will scoop up rock and dust samples from the lunar surface to be ferried back to Earth for testing.

The moondirt brought back by 
mankind's first moonwalkers, Gene Cernan, Neil Armstrong and Buzz 
Aldrin, contained an abundance of titanium, platinum and other rare 
minerals and Moon Express plan to plunder that gold mine 'for the good 
of humanity'.

'The MX-1 is the 'iPhone of space,' said Bob Richards, co-founder and CEO of manufacturer Moon Express. '[It's] a platform capable of supporting many 
apps including our core plan of exploring the Moon for resources of 
benefit to humanity.'

Versatile: Fuelled by hydrogen peroxide, the 'microlander' can deliver up to 130 pounds of cargo to the surface of the moon, or act as a sample return vehicle or a 'space-tug'

Moon Express is introducing the MX-1 as the first of a series of robotic space vehicles based on a scalable patent pending design to operate in Earth orbit and deep space destinations.

The last time a U.S. spacecraft touched down on the moon was on December 17 1972 when astronauts brought home 110kg of moon rock.

Last visit: Astronaut Eugene Cernan walks toward the Lunar Roving Vehicle near the U.S. flag at the Taurus-Littrow landing site of Apollo 17 on December 19, 1972

Safely home: Apollo 17 astronauts Eugene Cernan (waving) and Harrison Schmitt (on Cernan's left) spent about 75 hours on the Moon in the Taurus-Littrow valley, while colleague Ronald Evans (standing in back) orbited overhead

Small steps: This picture, taken by Neil Armstrong, shows Buzz Aldrin on the moon on July 20 1969

Apollo 11 - Jul 1969: Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, Buzz Aldrin (pictured)

First manned landing, in Sea of Tranquility. Moonwalk time: 2:31hr. Samples returned: 21.6kg

Apollo 12 - Nov 1969: C. Peter Conrad, Richard Gordon, Alan Bean

Second landing, in Ocean of Storms. Moonwalk time: 7:45hr. Samples returned: 34.3kg

Apollo 13 - Apr 1970: James Lovell, Jack Swigert, Fred Haise

Third
landing attempt aborted near the Moon, after oxygen tank explosion. 
Crew used lunar module as 'life boat' to return to Earth.

Apollo 14 - Jan 1971: Alan Shepard, Stuart Roosa, Edgar Mitchell

Third landing, in Fra Mauro. Moonwalk time: 9:21hr. Samples returned: 42.8kg

Apollo 15 - Jul 1971: David Scott, Alfred Worden, James Irwin

First Extended LM and rover, landed in Hadley-Apennine. Moonwalk time: 18:33hr. Samples returned: 77kg

Apollo 16 - Apr 1972: John Young, T. Kenneth Mattingly, Charles Duke

Landed in Plain of Descartes. Moonwalk time: 20:14hr. Samples returned: 94.5kg

Apollo 17 - Dec 1972: Eugene Cernan, Ronald Evans, Harrison Schmitt

Landed
in Taurus-Littrow. First geologist on the Moon. Final manned Moon 
landing. Moonwalk time: 22:02hr. Samples returned: 110.3kg

Apollo 17 was the sixth and last Apollo mission and the last time that humans walked on the surface.

The mission returned to earth on December 19, 1972.

The
team carried out a series of experiments including seismic profiling, 
atmospheric composition analysis and lunar sampling, orbital and 
biomedical experiments.

The crew spent 22 hours on the lunar surface in total.

Last year Nasa released an image taken by Cernan as he and Schmitt roamed the valley floor.

The
image shows Schmitt on the left with the lunar rover at the edge of 
Shorty Crater, near the spot where geologist Schmitt discovered orange 
lunar soil.

The Apollo
17 crew returned with 110 kilograms of rock and soil samples, more than
was returned from any of the other lunar landing sites.

Now forty years
later, Cernan and Schmitt are still the last to walk on the Moon.

Moon Express is just one of many private companies planning space missions.

Tourism, orbiting hotels are among the areas explored so far - but none has exploded more than the moon. Astrobiotic Technology is also vying to mine the moon.

Meanwhile, Bigelow Aerospace wants to sell property there, a Japanese firm suggested a solar panel power ring, and on Monday China launched the Chang’e 3 lander, which should touch down on the moon in mid-December.

It has even been claimed China wants to turn the moon into a 'Death Star' by planting missile silos on its surface.

It will be the first controlled landing since the Soviet Union’s Luna-24 mission in 1976.

'Nine billion. That’s how many people will be alive on the Earth as soon as 36 years from now,' Dennis Wingo, a space entrepreneur and author of the book MoonRush, told Fox News. 'The moon and beyond is an extension of our earthly society, with vast resources in metals and a place to expand human activity.'

Moon Express is yet to pick a place to land in 2015.

Richards said he is considering a spot in the Southern Hemisphere, near Surveyor 7 - the last robotic mission, which the U.S. soft-landed on the moon in 1968.

'It’s iconic to have the first private robotic lander resting next to the last government robotic lander,' he added.
