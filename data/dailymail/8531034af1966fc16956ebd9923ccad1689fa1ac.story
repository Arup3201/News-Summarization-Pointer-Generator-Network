A high school student in Arizona was suspended for three days on Friday after setting his laptop background wallpaper to a picture of a gun.

Daniel McClaine Jr, a freshman at Poston Butte High School in Florence, saved the image of an AK-47 on a communist-era Yugoslavia flag on his school-issued computer.

McClaine says that he is interested in joining the army, that the gun is not his and he found the photo online. But school officials said the image contravened guidelines and suspended the boy.

Threatening? A high school student in Arizona was suspended for three days after saving this picture as the wallpaper on his school issued laptop

'Offensive': Daniel McClaine said he is interested in joining the military and that the image is not violent. 'It's not showing anybody getting shot in any way. It's just a picture of a gun. It's nothing.'

Authorities claim the picture breaks the policy that students are forbidden from 'sending or displaying offensive messages or pictures,' and accessing, sending, creating or forwarding pictures deemed 'harassing, threatening, or illegal.'

McClaine disputes this, telling ABC that he doesn't see the image as threatening in any way.

'This gun wallpaper does not show anything that’s violent. It's not showing anybody getting shot in any way. It's just a picture of a gun.

'It's nothing - nobody getting shot, nobody getting it pointed at them, it's nothing,' the student said.

The school backed down and reduced the suspension after the boy's father, Daniel McClaine Sr, complained.

'To me it's ridiculous,' said McClaine Sr. Three days for a picture? It wasn't like he was standing in front of the school holding the gun.'

'He should have got a warning. He shouldn't have ever been suspended. Not for something so frivolous,' the student's father added.

McClaine Jr will now return to school on Monday rather than Friday.

As reported by ABC, Dana Hawman, a spokesperson for the Florence Unified School District, released the following statement:

'Although we cannot specifically discuss student discipline, we can certainly agree that violence in schools is a sensitive and timely issue.

'Students, parents and staff are on edge, and the daily news delivers more reasons for caution. All of us must work together to protect our kids and to cultivate an environment that is conducive to learning.'
