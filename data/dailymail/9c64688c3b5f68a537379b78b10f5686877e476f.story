Scientists have claimed there has never been life on Mars - because the red planet is too cold.

They believe ancient riverbeds on the planet were created by brief warm spells following volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts and changes in orbit.

But these would not have lasted long enough to allow organisms to develop, they said.

No life on Mars? Scientists have claimed there has never been life on Mars - because the planet is too cold

Researchers studied hundreds of craters at Aeolis Dorsa, a 3.6 billion year old region near the Curiosity rover 
landing site.

Their findings, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, suggest the atmospheric pressure on Mars was insufficient to heat
 the surface above freezing when water would have flowed.

They challenge the 
explanation that the liquid was caused by the planet having a dense 
atmosphere rich with greenhouse gases.

Planetary
 experts analysed high resolution digital images of 319 small craters 
taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) to work out the atmospheric 
pressure at the time they were formed.

Evidence of life? But the warm periods would not have lasted long enough to allow organisms to develop, they said. Above, rock layers on Mars, which have been previously cited as evidence that it was once habitable

They said that
 heat and enormous stress on an object that penetrates a thick 
atmosphere causes it to break apart. But if the atmosphere is thinner, smaller objects
 are able to reach the surface.

Dr
 Edwin Kite, of Princeton University, New Jersey, said that whether a 
meteoroid survives transit through the Martian 
atmosphere and forms a crater depends on the
 density of the air it must penetrate.

Therefore, the size of the smallest craters in Mars's river deposits yields 
information of the atmospheric pressure on the planet at around the time the rivers
 flowed.

Dr Kite said: 'The 
minimum size of craters serves as a proxy for ancient pressure of 
planetary atmospheres, because thinner atmospheres permit smaller 
objects to reach the surface at high velocities and form craters.'

Researchers compared the size of the craters to numerous computer 
simulations over a range of atmospheric pressures.

They concluded the
 atmospheric pressure on Mars would have been much greater than it is today - but would have been less than required to warm the surface above 
freezing.

Instead, the flow of liquid on Mars must have formed 
over a relatively short time - not allowing enough time for 
the extended warm, wet conditions necessary for life to arise, they said.

Dr Kite 
said if his researchers' findings are correct, then a dense atmosphere rich in greenhouse gases and water is 'ruled out, and long term average 
temperatures [on Mars] were most likely below freezing'.

Astrobiologist
 Dr Sanjoy Som, of NASA Ames Research Centre in California, said this 
new field of geology is adding much needed constraints to our 
understanding of planetary atmospheres.

Dr
 Som, who reviewed the study for the journal, said: 'The longevity of 
stable liquid water on the ancient Martian surface may prove to be a key
 factor in considering whether life could have taken hold early in the 
planet's history.

'Applying the impact crater proxy to more ancient and diverse Martian deposits may help to further unravel the history of Mars.'

Mystery: It comes just weeks after a white speck of 'light' (circled) was captured on Mars by Curiosity rover - leading some to believe that life is thriving on the planet. But Nasa said the bright spot was not that unusual

It comes just weeks after a strange white speck of 'light' was captured on Mars by Curiosity rover - leading some to believe that life is currently thriving on the planet.

UFO blogger Scott Waring claimed the photograph suggests there are intelligent creatures living underground.

But Nasa later announced the bright spot was not that unusual - and could even be a 'glint from a rock surface reflecting the sun'.
