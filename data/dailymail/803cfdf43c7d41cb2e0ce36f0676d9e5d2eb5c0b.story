At a cost of $350million, it aimed to revive Downtown Las Vegas and 'bring happiness to everyone'.

But today, the technology-oriented Downtown Project's success bubble has burst.

In the past few weeks, founder and Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh has stepped down, while 30 of the project's 300 employees have been laid off.

At the same time, the suicides of three prominent entrepreneurs involved in the program have sparked mystery among the community.

Suicides: In January 2013, Jody Sherman (left), 48, founder of Econom, shot himself in a car as his  start-up company headed toward bankruptcy. One year later, Ovik Banerjee (right), 24, also committed suicide

In January 2013, Jody Sherman, the 48-year-old founder of Econom, shot himself in a car as his e-commerce start-up headed toward bankruptcy.

One year later, Ovik Banerjee, a 24-year-old Venture for America fellow who moved to Downtown Vegas as part of the project, jumped  from his Town Terrace apartment. 

His death prompted four other employees at the Downtown Project to quit, according to Recode.net.

Meanwhile, in May 2014, Matt Berman,  the 50-year-old founder of Bolt Barber, was found hanged in an apparent suicide at his home.

Although the reasons behind the suicides remain unclear, those involved in the project have said that 40-year-old Hsieh's 'obsession with happiness' could be damaging for entrepreneurs.

Indeed, in his 2010 book, 'Delivering Happiness', the enigmatic businessman says his proposal to build a startup city was about creating a 'happy', connected and entrepreneurial lifestyle.

He writes: 'It wasn’t just about building a business. It was about building a lifestyle that was about delivering happiness to everyone, including ourselves.'

His plan saw eager entrepreneurs to move to Las Vegas and start up a company - the project gained more than 300 in total - with little emotional support if their firm began to fail.

Kimberly Knoll, a therapist in Downtown, told the technology news site: 'The difference here is the focus on happiness - that’s a goal. But if we negate the negative emotions in our lives, it takes us away from happiness and brings around shame.

'The whole idea of Downtown is grand and wonderful and purposeful, but sometimes the way we’re going about it isn’t psychologically healthy.'

She added: 'The pressures are the lack of being able to confide with people, having to put on a vest or mask, and having to say everything’s great.'

Following the  suicides, Hsieh was reportedly keen to keep them quiet in the community, with entrepreneurs claiming there were few resources made available and no cathartic outpouring.

When asked about the deaths, the former leader is said to have snapped: 'Suicides happen anywhere. Look at the stats.'

In the case of Mr Banerjee, the employee had been forced to work in a 'confusing' environment without a 'clear'  job, it is reported.

At one point, he was even been told to mislead city officials about the nature of the project - an order that went against his principles and 'tore him up', a friend of Mr Banerjee told the site. 

Before his death, he reportedly emailed Hsieh saying he was concerned about the Downtown Project and its allocation of resources, but received 'dismissive' responses to each concern. 

According to the LA Times, Nevada's suicide rate is among the nation's highest, with 19.1 deaths per 100,000 residents, compared to a national average of 12 per 100,000.

Most of these deaths occur around Las Vegas, where the odds of suicide are said to be around 50 per cent greater than in other U.S. metropolitan areas. 

Because of this, Downtown Project residents are now planning to set up a dedicated hotline to help people who are thinking of taking their own lives. 

Jonathan Jenkins,  co-founder of supply chain startup OrderWithMe, has even set up a church in Dowtown Last Vegas to cater for struggling entrepreneurs. 

'A lot of the young people who do these startups, they don’t think they can be frank with each other,' he told the news site.

Launched in January 2012, with a five-year plan, the Downtown Project aimed to revitalize the blighted area of Las Vegas through 'several hundred investments and initiatives'.

In a recent statement about the laying off of employees, Hsieh said: 'We remain focused on the long-term plan and the evolution of the downtown area.

'As such, we have restructured our support team. This change has affected approximately 30 positions, the majority of which were based in our corporate office.

'We continue to directly employ more than 300 people across our various operations in downtown Las Vegas.

'We are optimistic and confident about the future of downtown Las Vegas and the continued growth of our entire portfolio of investments.'

He also downplayed his role in the startup city, saying: 'I am the CEO of Zappos.com but I’ve never referred to myself as the CEO of Downtown Project, and I’ve never considered myself as being in “day-to-day management” of Downtown Project.

'My role continues to be as an investor, advisor, and equivalent of a board member that sets high-level general direction and strategy but is not involved in day-to-day management of people or projects.'
