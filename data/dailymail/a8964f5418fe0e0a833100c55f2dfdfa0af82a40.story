The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its protocols to better protect healthcare workers treating Ebola patients, the institute announced Monday.

Three updated guidelines have been established as the United States looks to be gaining an upper hand on the virus that has infected three and led to hundreds being put under observation.

The CDC now stipulates that medical personnel coming in contact or treating Ebola patients must cover all skin and hair.

Cover: Medical staff were previously required to only don a face shield, leaving some skin exposed, as shown by a nurse transporting a Texas deputy who had visited the apartment of Thomas Eric Duncan. New guidelines require all skin to be covered.

The previous set of guidelines—based on those from the World Health Organization—only required a mask and goggles.

Use face shield, gown or coverall, boot cover and double gloves

Wear hood to completely cover the head and neck

Use respirator, not goggles

Put on waterproof apron if patient is vomiting or has diarrhea

Designate area for putting on and taking off gear

Have trained monitor supervise the putting on and removal of gear

Use disinfectant wipes on contaminated gear before removing

Disinfect gloved hands between steps while taking off gear

Conduct repeated training for using protective gear

The new guidelines also require healthcare workers to have  hands-on training putting on and taking off protective equipment and to be supervised while suiting up before treating a patient.

Personal protective equipment, or PPE, for treating patients of the virus now includes a gown or coverall, disposable hoods, a respirator with face shield, boot covers and double gloves.

The CDC is strengthening its protocols in the wake of two nurses contracting the virus, which is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids and tissue, after treating Thomas Eric Duncan, who died of the virus on October 8.

'Even a single healthcare worker infection is unacceptable,' Director Tom Frieden told reporters during a teleconference on the new guidelines.

43 people were declared risk free on Monday after being monitored for having come in direct or indirect contact with Duncan, who was diagnosed with Ebola after flying from Liberia.

Some of those declared free of the virus were four people living with him in an apartment, including Louise Troh, Duncan's fiancee.

As of October 17, WHO reports the hemorrhagic fever has infected around 9,000 and killed more than 4,500 people in  Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea in West Africa.

Protection: Updated guidelines also require nurses, doctors and medical technicians to receive repeat hands-on training and be supervised when putting on and taking off equipment

Lapses: The National Nurses Union have said nurses at Texas Presbyterian Hospital reported that protective suits left their necks exposed below the face mask

Exposed: Gloves were not taped to protective suits, as protocol required, exposing wrists and hands to exposure from bodily fluids

The CDC has drawn criticism for its handling of Ebola cases diagnosed in the United States. 

Amber Vinson reportedly spoke to a CDC official who cleared her to fly on a commercial flight with a fever of 99.5 degrees after having treated Duncan.
