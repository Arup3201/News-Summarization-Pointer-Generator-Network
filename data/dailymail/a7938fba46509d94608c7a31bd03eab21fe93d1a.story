Rihanna has been ordered to delete a patriotic photograph posted on her Instagram and Twitter feeds to celebrate Veterans' Day after a jewellery company claimed she stole it, it has been reported. 

The R&B star uploaded the image of an glistening diamond necklace hovering above a rendition of the Stars and Stripes in the shape of a 'V'.

She, or a member of her publicity team, then superimposed an image of herself beside it and removed the hashtag of the jewellery company which created the original picture.

In the original, the hashtag #coronetdiamonds appears in the bottom right hand corner of the image. 

But now Coronet Diamonds has issued a cease and desist notice to the singer, demanding that she take it down and apologize,TMZ.com reported.

'So we found out Coronet has sent Rihanna a cease and desist letter,' reported TMZ. 'They'll settle for an apology on Rihanna's social media platforms ... an apology that makes it clear Coronet created the image.'
