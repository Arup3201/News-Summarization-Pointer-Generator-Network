A five-year-old girl has died from a rare blood disorder just seven weeks after her parents thought she was simply suffering from a cold.

Violet Mornington first began suffering from symptoms on her fifth birthday. But within just weeks of contracting what turned out to be a rare blood disorder, she had lost her life.

She had been suffering from a little-known condition called Hemophagocytic 
Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).

Violet Mornington first began suffering from symptoms on her fifth birthday. Just weeks later, she had died from a rare blood disorder called Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)

Her devastated parents Kerry, 46 and 
Ivan, 36, have spoken about their heartbreak in the 
hope of raising awareness of the disorder, which leads to too many white
blood cells attacking the body.

Mrs Mornington, from Fradley, Staffordshire, said: 'She’d always been a fighter and had a strong and determined personality.

'She was a real tomboy, too, and when she passed away at the hospital we dressed her in her favourite Spiderman pyjamas.

'She refused to wear dresses from the age of three and she loved unusual music - we played Depeche Mode’s Just Can’t Get Enough at her funeral as it was one of her favourite songs.'

Violet's parents, who both work as benefits officers, first became worried about the youngster on the day she turned five.

Her father recalled: 'It was a Monday
and Violet went to school as normal but when she came home, she said 
she didn’t feel too well.

'We went for a quiet meal but throughout she looked pale. We thought she was exhausted from celebrating her birthday at school.

Devastated: Violet's parents Kerry and Ivan said they assumed she was simply suffering from a cold. She was later diagnosed with tonsillitis but her symptoms continued to deteriorate

'But over the next couple of days you could tell she wasn’t herself. She was still pale, tired and had a temperature. We put it down to a cold.

'We had a party planned for her on the Saturday. It was the first time we’d decided to throw a big do and had booked the local village hall, with a DJ and bouncy castle.

'We were debating whether to cancel it, but by the Friday, she had picked up so decided to go ahead.

'For the first half of it she was really energetic and jumping on the bouncy castle. But then she got all shivery and we gave her some Calpol. She did pick up a little bit later on.'

On Monday, Violet's father took her to see the nurse at their GP practice as she was too unwell for school.

He
was told she had tonsillitis and Violet was given antibiotics. But 
instead of improving, she got worse and later that week she saw the 
doctor. Again, her parents were told it would probably clear up.

After repeated GP visits, Violet's desperate parents took her to A&E, where doctors suspected she had leukaemia. She was transferred to Birmingham Children's Hospital

The family went back and forth to see their GP over the next three weeks, but still there was no diagnosis.

In desperation, the couple took her to A&E. More tests and scans were carried out and the next day the couple were told the youngster had suspected leukaemia.

She was transferred to Birmingham Children’s Hospital where a bone marrow biopsy was done.'Violet
was becoming more and more distressed because of all the tests being 
done,' said Mrs Mornington. 'She was very upset and it was heartbreaking
to see her like that.

'She
would suffer from raging temperatures which was one of the symptoms of 
HLH, but of course we didn’t know at that point it was the disorder.'

Eventually
doctors ruled out leukaemia, and finally, tests found that she had the 
Epstein-Barr Virus, which had led to Hodgkins Lymphoma.

Mr Mornington, who has a daughter Beth, 19, from another relationship, said that Violet was given steroids - but her condition deteriorated.

Tragic: Violet as a baby with mother Kerry (left) and right, shortly before she died. Her mother said: 'She was a real tomboy - and when she passed away at the hospital we dressed her in her favourite Spiderman pyjamas'

Hemophagocytic 
Lymphohistiocytosis was finally diagnosed but, although Violet started showing some signs of improvement after going through three lots of chemotherapy, it was short-lived as she started suffering from serious respiratory problems.

Doctors were then forced to put her into an induced coma. 'It was like a whirlwind,' added Mrs Mornington, who has twins Molly and Caitlin, aged 16, and Matt, 26, from her first marriage.

On July 20, the couple were told to get some rest and were staying in the hospital’s nearby facility for relatives.But they were woken at 5.55am the next day by a call telling them Violet had deteriorated.

Mrs Mornington added: 'We rushed to 
the hospital and saw Violet hooked up to so many machines. Doctors told 
us that she was very poorly and didn’t think she would get through it.

'Later
that day, we were told she wouldn’t pull through and that they could 
take away all the machines so that we could spend some time with her to 
say goodbye.

Violet, here with father Ivan,
was finally diagnosed with HLH, and underwent three rounds of chemotherapy. But she began to suffer from serious respiratory problems and doctors were forced to put her into an induced coma

'At this point
she wasn’t suffering, but it was heartbreaking to watch her go through 
this. We decided to spend time with her, and we had 30 precious minutes 
giving her cuddles and telling her we loved her before she slipped 
away.'

Since Violet’s death the couple, along with their other children, have been trying to raise more awareness about the condition.

Her father explained: 'We want people
out there to know about HLH and what it can do and how quickly it can 
strike. GPs don’t seem to be aware, and if it is something they are 
taught about then it can only help other sufferers.

'I’ve
read up on the condition and if it’s treated within four weeks of being
detected, then you can save the person’s life. When we first took 
Violet to the doctors, she probably had it then. But because they didn’t
know about the disorder it went undetected.'

Violet's mother said: 'Before she died, we had 30 precious minutes giving her cuddles and telling her we loved her before she slipped away.' The family are now trying to raise more awareness about Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)

Mrs Mornington added: 'There isn’t a minute that goes by where we don’t think about her. Her legacy for us is to help others and stop this happening again. We want to do this to keep her memory alive. It was too late for us but hopefully it won’t be for other families.'

Family and friends are raising cash for Birmingham Children’s Hospital - where Violet Mornington was treated - by taking on Mount Snowdon.

They hope to raise £5,000 for Birmingham Children’s Hospital, by carrying out the trek, and they will also be joined by Violet’s family.

As well as climbing Snowdon, other events are being held.
