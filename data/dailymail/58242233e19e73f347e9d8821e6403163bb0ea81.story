New parents Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall may choose a name for their daughter in honour of a past Queen.

Zara gave birth to a baby girl at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital this morning, with her husband Mike Tindall present at the birth.

The weight of the baby was 7lbs 12oz, Buckingham Palace announced today.

The Princess Royal broke with tradition and gave her daughter Zara - a name not associated with the British Royal Family.

Princess Anne (seen today at her estate where her new granddaughter is believed to be) broke with tradition and gave her daughter Zara a name not readily associated with the British Royal Family

But Zara and Mike could pick a moniker for their baby that harks back to monarchs of the past.

Among the favourites with bookmakers are Charlotte, Elizabeth, Victoria and Anne.

Queen Charlotte, who was born in 1744, was married to George III. Charlotte was actually her second name - her first being Sophie.

A keen botanist, she founded Kew Gardens, had 15 children - 13 of whom survived - and was a patron of the arts.

Some historians have argued that she was of African descent. Her daughter, born in 1766, was also called Charlotte and later known as the Princess Royal.

George IV also named his only child Charlotte, but she died in childbirth at the age of 21, leading to a mass outpouring of grief across the nation.

Elizabeth is a highly respected name amongst the monarchy.

The Queen is held in great respect by her family. Zara's great-grandmother the Queen Mother was also Elizabeth.

Elizabeth I, the last Tudor monarch who ruled from 1558 until 1603.

Victoria would pay tribute to the longest reigning British monarch so far. Victoria ruled for more than 63 years, acceding to the throne in 1837. Britain had evolved into a constitutional monarchy.

Anne, seen, with Zara on her Christening day, has a close relationship with her daughter, who has praised her parenting skills and hopes to follow in her footsteps

She became the figurehead of a vast empire and her reign spanned the rest of the century.

She married Prince Albert and had nine children, but mourned his early death for the rest of her life.

Anne could refer to either Zara's mother, the Princess Royal, or Queen Anne, who was the last of the Stuart monarchs. She became Queen aged 37 in 1702 and reigned until her death in 1714.

Married to Prince George of Denmark she gave birth to more than a dozen children but none survived her.

Anne suffered from poor health and her weight ballooned towards the end of her life.

As speculation grew around what the baby's name would be, one person said that Zara had expressed a liking for the name 'Poppy'.

Adele Horton, 30, said her brother Tom spoke to Zara at a rugby match in November.

Miss Horton, a support worker from Gloucester, said: 'My brother was down at the rugby and he quite often sees Zara because she is sometimes down in the stands.

'He saw her at the Japan game on November 12 and told her that his girlfriend was due the same time and that they were thinking about the name Teddy, so she better not steal it.

'She was having a joke back and saying that they were thinking of Poppy - so maybe that will be the name.'

Bookies have placed odds on a variety of names, including:  3/1 Charlotte, 5/1 Victoria, 6/1 Anne, 7/1 Elizabeth, 9/1 Catherine, 10/1 Emma, 10/1 Isobella, 14/1 Grace,14/1 Sarah, 14/1 Zara, 16/1 Emily, 16/1 Sophie, 20/1 Phillipa, 20/1 Zoe, 25/1 Polly, 50/1 Linda.
