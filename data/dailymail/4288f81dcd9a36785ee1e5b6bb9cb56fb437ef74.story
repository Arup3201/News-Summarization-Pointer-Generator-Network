Australian police today admitted that it may be impossible to recover the bodies of all 298 victims as intense fighting forced international investigators back from the crash site for a second time.

The delegation of Australian and Dutch police and forensic experts stopped in Shakhtarsk, a town around 20 miles from the fields where the aircraft was downed, amid sounds of explosions.

A high-rise apartment block in the town was hit by at least two rounds of artillery, according to reports and dozens of families living in the area fled. Pro-Russian rebels admitted they had lost control of part of the crash site.

Meanwhile in Canberra, Australian Federal Police deputy commissioner Andrew Colvin says there is a possibility they won't get to the crash site in the near future.

Fighting around the Malaysia Airlines crash site in eastern Ukraine prevented Dutch and Australian police officers from reaching the wreckage for a second day

'Of course it is a highly volatile area,' he said on Monday, adding that safety was paramount.

Mr Colvin warned of the difficult circumstances the mission faces, including the size of the crash scene, trauma to the bodies of victims, and complications gaining access to the site almost two weeks after the Malaysia Airlines plane was brought down by a surface-to-air missile.

'We have to prepare ourselves for the possibility that not all remains will ultimately be recovered,' he said.

The Dutch-led police mission will make a second attempt to gain access to the crash site in eastern Ukraine on Monday after it was forced to abandon a bid on Sunday because of intense fighting in the area.

The 49-person mission that includes 11 AFP officers is waiting for the go-ahead in the rebel-held city of Donetsk, about 60 kilometres away.

Russian-backed separatists have agreed to allow an unarmed international police team to recover more bodies and start a forensic examination of wreckage.

In all, some 170 unarmed AFP officers have been deployed in Ukraine as part of the recovery effort.

A total of 298 people, including 37 Australian residents and citizens, were killed in the disaster.

The development comes as UN human rights chief Navi Pillay said the downing of flight MH17 in eastern Ukraine may constitute a 'war crime'.

The mandate of the police team is to secure the currently
rebel-controlled area so that comprehensive investigations can begin and any
remaining bodies can be recovered.

With government troops intensifying their push to claw back
more territory from pro-Russian separatist rebels, the death toll is mounting
steadily.

Today rebels admitted they had lost control of part of the crash site to pro-Kiev forces.

United Nations figures show more than 1,100 people have died in just
over four months of fighting.

Ukraine has accused rebels of tampering with evidence and
trying to cover up their alleged role in bringing the Malaysia Airlines plane
down with an anti-aircraft missile.

Separatist officials have staunchly denied responsibility
for shooting down the airliner and killing all 298 people on board.

News that investigators were unable to reach the crash site for a second day comes as the UN said it was considering whether to classify the downing of MH17 as a war crime.

Human rights chief Navi Pillay spoke out to say taking down to plane with a surface to air missile could constitute a war crime.

Wrecked: A man stands in rubble of a damaged house in Horlivka. Separatist leader Alexander Boroday accused president Petro Poroshenko of starting a new military offensive to hide the truth about MH17

Deadly: Smoke is seen rising over rebel-held Donetsk overnight. Today alone, at least eight civilians were killed by fighting and shelling in rebel-held cities in eastern Ukraine - three of them in Donetsk

A Ukrainian security spokesman said data from the recovered flight recorders shows Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crashed due to a massive, explosive loss of pressure after being punctured multiple times by shrapnel.

Andrei Lysenko said the plane suffered 'massive explosive decompression' after it was hit by fragments he said came from a missile.

The data recorders were sent to UK experts for examination.

In their campaign to take control over more territory from separatist forces, Ukraine's army has deployed a growing amount of heavy weaponry.

Rebels have also been able to secure large quantities of powerful weapons, much of which the United States and Ukraine maintain is being supplied by Russia.

Moscow denies the claims.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a report that at least 1,129 people have been killed between mid-April, when fighting began, and July 26.

The report said at least 3,442 people had been wounded and more than 100,000 people had left their homes. A UN report from mid-June put the death toll at 356.

At least eight civilians were killed 
by fighting and shelling in two cities held by separatist militants 
overnight, officials in the region said today

Authorities
 in Luhansk said that five people were killed and 15 injured by 
overnight artillery strikes. Three were killed in Donetsk as a result of
 clashes.

Rebel leader Alexander Boroday accused Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko of starting a new military offensive to hide the truth about the downing of MH17.

Intensified combat operations 'are irrefutable evidence proving that Kiev is seeking to destroy all evidence of the crime committed by its military,' he alleged.

'The junta is in panic, the only thing that matters for them today is to evade exposure.

'Kiev's actions run counter to Poroshenko's decision to declare a 40-kilometre zone around the crash site a ceasefire territory.'

Ukrainian military analyst Dmitry Tymchuk today alleged that rebels were sneaking back dressed as civilians into areas 'liberated' by the Ukrainian army.Â 

'The activity of the enemy's sabotage groups is high,' he said.
