A young artist who paints using only her lips has created the ultimate Royal tribute - with a portrait of the Duchess of Cambridge made by kissing a canvas thousands of times.

Natalie Irish of Houston, Texas, created the portrait by putting on lipstick before pressing her lips against a blank canvas.

By varying the pressure of her kisses she was able to create an accomplished portrait of the duchess - with an uncanny likeness.

Pride of place: The portrait is on display at Ripley's Believe It Or Not! in London

The artist, who says she started 
creating these stamp-style portraits at school using thumb prints, has 
previously rendered Marilyn Monroe and Jimi Hendrix in lipstick marks 
too.

In a video she uploaded to YouTube last year, Ms Irish is seen in action, creating the Monroe portrait, solely with the use of her lips.

The Hendrix canvas was rendered using Urban Decay 'Confession' lipstick.

Ms Irish says: 'It was a more sheer colour and had to be applied in numerous 
layers to get the darker tones'.

Telling MailOnline how she came to 
the idea of her lipstick portraits, Ms Irish recalls learning how to 
paint pictures with thumbprints back in high school.

She
 said: 'I always got a good response from them, but because it had been 
done before by other artists, I never felt like it was my own.

'I
 was getting ready to go to a show one night and put on a bit of red 
lipstick. I blotted it on a piece of paper and it hit me.

'I started experimenting and decided Marilyn Monroe would be the perfect candidate for a portrait with kisses.'

Ms Irish admitted that her lips get very tired, and that she owns 'many tubes of both lipstick and chapstick'.

She said her eyes get tired from constantly moving between very close to farther back from the canvas to examine her work.

On her website, natalieirish.com, she writes of herself: 'There 
are rumours that she has been creating works of art since in utero. 

'Following
 her birth, Natalie Irish quickly began to shock and amaze every entity 
with her astonishing artwork of all conceivable mediums and dominate all
 competitions of the arts'. 

Ms Irish goes on to claim that she 
earned Best in District at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo Art 
Competition when she was five years old.

She then went on to study with the 
Galveston Arts Alliance, and attended the University of North Texas, 
where she studied metalsmithing and ceramics.
