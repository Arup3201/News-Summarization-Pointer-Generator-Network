Landmark case: An appeal against the sentence given to Stuart Hall could be among the first cases to be televised live later this year

An appeal against the 'lenient' jail sentence given to sex attacker Stuart Hall could be televised live on television this October.

The former broadcaster's 15-month prison term for indecently assaulting young girls over three decades prompted outrage from campaigners last month.

The Attorney General Dominic Grieve has received around 150 complaints and is currently considering whether to appeal the sentence.

If the appeal goes ahead, it could be one of the first cases to be heard live before television cameras which are to be allowed in courts in England and Wales for the first time since 1925.

The move comes as a landmark documentary is due to be shown on Channel 4 which captures an entire murder trial.

Award-winning documentary maker Nick Holt was allowed unprecedented access to all proceedings in the retrial of Nat Fraser - a 
businessman who was convicted for murdering his wife Arlene.

After three years of negotiation, Holt's team was given permission to film
the judge, lawyers, defendant and witnesses.

Her 
body has never been found, there is no weapon, no crime scene and her 
husband appeared to have a cast iron alibi for the day she disappeared.

With
over 70 witnesses and 104 pieces of evidence the complex case was 
dissected firstly by the prosecution QC Alex Prentice and then the defence QC John Scott.

Judges' verdicts and sentencing will be allowed in the Royal Courts of Justice from October

Nat
Fraser was first brought to trial in 2003 for the murder of his wife and was found guilty.

But Fraser argued that the trial was a miscarriage 
of justice and challenged the verdict.

His conviction was quashed in 2011 but Fraser was sent back to court for a fresh trial in April last year.

He was found guilty of murder for a second time and sentenced to a minimum of 17 years in prison.

The two-hour documentary, The Murder Trial, will be broadcast on Tuesday July 9 at 9pm on Channel 4.

Nick Holt told the Independent: 'We
have a right to see this process which costs us an enormous amount of 
money and which we are very good at and very thorough at.

'There is 
nothing to hide, nothing shameful going on. The process of filming 
demystifies the legal process.'

Unprecedented: In a legal first, a documentary crew were able to film the retrial of Nat Fraser, left, convicted of murdering his wife Arlene, right, at the Scottish High Court for a second time

Access: Cameras were allowed to follow an entire case - including to its court room climax - for the Channel 4 documentary Murder Trial, pictured

Historic: In a first in British legal history, cameras recorded legal proceedings from inside the court room

Warning: Some legal experts have warned opening up the court room to cameras could harm justice

Broadcasters
will be allowed into the Court of Appeal from October and this is 
likely to be extended to crown court prosecutions.

Lord Judge said he takes 'a very strong view' about cameras being turned on during sentencing

It will be for the broadcasters to determine which cases are televised, subject to necessary judicial checks.

That
means the cases likely to be carried live will be high profile trials 
involving celebrities and child murderers, like Soham killer Ian 
Huntley, Stuart Hazell, who was recently convicted of murdering Tia 
Sharp and Mark Bridger, the killer of April Jones.

The opening up of courts to cameras has sparked a heated debate within the legal profession.

Earlier this year The Lord Chief 
Justice warned that allowing court broadcasts would lead to judges being
booed and heckled when verdicts are announced.

Lord
Judge said: ‘I’m very troubled about having cameras just swanning 
around,’ he said, saying he takes ‘a very strong view’ about cameras 
being turned on during sentencing.

Judges will have the final say over which cases can be televised.

A senior source said: ‘In some cases it will not be in the interests of justice to broadcast footage.’

The judges will be able to ban the cameras in those cases but will have to explain their reasons.

‘The presumption will be that the cameras are allowed in unless there is a very good reason why not,’ the source said.

Open justice: In future, the trials of child killers such as Stuart Hazell, left, and Mark Bridger, right, could be broadcast live on television

At the outset, cameras will be placed in certain courts at the Royal Courts of Justice.

Prime Minister David Cameron and 
Justice Secretary Chris Grayling have pushed for greater openness in the
courts in England and Wales following criticism that the antiquated 
courts system is unaccountable and old fashioned.

A
No 10 source said: ‘This is an important step in opening up the court 
process. Allowing the public to watch justice in action will help build 
trust in our judicial system.

‘Hearing why verdicts have been given and watching the sentencing process will add to public confidence in the courts.’
