He's called Pippa Middleton ugly, Adele fat and Lana del Rey fake, and now Karl Lagerfeld has unleashed his acid tongue on pretty much anyone who has had cosmetic surgery in attempt to conceal the aging process.

'The worst are the lip operations,' he rants to Zeit Online. 'They look like they flew through the windscreen during a car accident and were patched up badly afterwards.'

The 88-year-old fashion designer - who is perhaps as famous for his cutting remarks as he is for his work at the helm of Chanel - added that he knows people he doesn't even 'recognize' after they've undergone lip surgery.

Outspoken: Eighty-eight-year-old Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld (pictured last week in London) has slammed those who go under the knife in order to look younger

'Nothing makes you look older than attempting to look young,' he continues.

And Mr Lagerfeld's contempt for the 'old' appears to extend much further than just those who try to cheat the clock by going under the knife.

'I don't know anyone from my generation. I find those people terrible', he admits, favoring the company of much younger people instead.

Car crash? Mr Lagerfeld took particular issue with lip surgery, likening people who have had it (such as Jocelyn Wildenstein, 74, pictured) with victims of car accidents who have 'flown through the windscreen'

And he is true to his word when it comes to hanging out with a younger crowd. The formidable fashion king regularly makes appearances in the selfies of the young Hollywood-elite, most recently posing at a Prada store launch party with 21-year-old model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne and singer Lily Allen, 29.

He's also a fan of 24-year-old actress Kristen Stewart, who stars in his latest campaign for Chanel, and was once regularly spotted in the company of Lindsay Lohan - although that was before she started sporting her famous 'trout pout', and we know now how he feels about that.

But even his favorite supermodel, Miss Delevingne, hasn't escaped Mr Lagerfeld's sharp tongue of late. Speaking to The Guardian last month, he revealed that he did not consider the bushy-browed Brit to be 'a standout beauty' - but rather a model with 'strange' proportions.

Younger crowd: The formidable designer also says he prefers the company of younger friends (pictured with Cara Delevingne and Lily Allen last week) over his own 'terrible' generation

He also spoke frankly of his views on tattoos, beloved by his many youthful friends worldwide, saying: 'Tattoos are like sleeping in a printed T-shirt, you will never get clean again.'

Mr Lagerfeld, who has enjoyed a 67 year career in the fashion industry, concludes his interview with Zeit by offering a little insight as to the very beginnings of his age-related preferences.

'As a child I only had one wish: to be grown up,' he remarks.

'I didn't play with other children, I thought they were dreadful. The only thing I did was read, learn languages and sketch.'
