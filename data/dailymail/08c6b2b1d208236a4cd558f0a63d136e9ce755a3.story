David McMahon was blinded in one eye after he was hit by a golf ball struck by golfer Gavin Dear. The pensioner is now suing the pro for £50,000

A pensioner is suing a professional golfer for £50,000 after being blinded in one eye by a ball while he worked at a tournament.

David McMahon was on the course at the Scottish amateur Champion of Champions event, looking for balls struck into the gorse by competitors, when he was struck by a shot that ruptured his eyeball.

Mr McMahon, 70, is seeking £50,000 from Gavin Dear, a former Walker Cup player who turned professional in 2009.

Yesterday, a judge was told that the amount of damages had been agreed between lawyers in the action – but that liability was still contested.

Mr McMahon said he had approached a couple who had strayed off a path and asked them to move as they were in danger where they were standing at the tournament on Leven Links, Fife, in April 2009.

He said Mr Dear was ‘on the edge of the semi rough’ between the sixth and 12th fairways.

Mr McMahon then turned to walk back to his golf buggy when he was hit in the eye by a ball. He told the court: ‘I landed right on the ground. The ball hit me and I went down.

'I covered my eye with my glove. I took my glove back and it was full of blood.’

Mr McMahon was asked by his counsel, Ronald Clancy, QC, if he heard anyone shout a warning before he was hit by the ball and he replied: ‘No.’

Mr Clancy asked him what he would have done if at the point he turned away from speaking to the spectators to return to the buggy he had heard the warning shout of ‘Fore’.

Mr McMahon responded: ‘I would have become the ground. I have been hit eight times by golf balls and, take my word for it, it is sore.’

When questioned by Graham Primrose, QC for Mr Dear, the retired bus driver from Leven denied he was behind the buggy and emerged into the path of the ball.

In the action, it is said that Mr McMahon suffered a traumatic rupture of the right eyeball resulting in blindness to the eye.

It is alleged that Mr Dear knew,  or ought to have known, that Mr McMahon was in line with the path of his ball to the sixth hole.

It is claimed that, had the golfer exercised reasonable care in ensuring that no one was standing in a position to be struck by the ball, he would not have been injured.

Mr Dear, 28, of Scone, Perthshire, maintains that neither Mr McMahon nor the alleged spectators were visible at any stage to him, his playing partner or two men accompanying them on their round.

He said he had played his tee shot on the par five sixth hole into light rough which divides the sixth and 12th fairways and was content with its landing position.

He claims that he saw a buggy but there was no sign of any person at or near it.

Mr Dear maintains that, having considered the position of the buggy and noted the absence of any activity, he proceeded to consider playing his second shot.

It is said: ‘He had no reason not to believe that it was safe and appropriate to do so.’

It is claimed that after the ball was struck Mr McMahon emerged ‘suddenly and without warning’ from behind a golf cart.

Mr Dear maintains that he acted at all times with reasonable care.

The case continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
