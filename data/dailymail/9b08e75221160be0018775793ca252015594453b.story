The Hunchback of Notre Dame would be jumping for joy at the news.

Nine new enormous bronze bells have arrived at the Paris cathedral to replace the old ones that had been discordant for decades, and to help the landmark rediscover its historical harmony.

The bells, named after saints, and prominent Catholic figures, will be on display at Notre Dame from Saturday until February 25 when they will be hoisted to its iconic twin towers.

The new bells are scheduled to ring for the first time March 23, in time for Palm Sunday and Easter week.

The diocese decided to have new ones cast
as part of celebrations marking 850 years since the beginning of the 
cathedral's construction in 1163. It took nearly 90 years to build.

Although the sound of Notre Dame will no
longer be that of the medieval bells fictionally operated by French 
author Victor Hugo's hunch-backed bell-ringer, Quasimodo, it will be a 
great improvement.

The old bells, which dated from different
periods throughout Notre Dame's history, were out of tune with each 
other and with Emmanuel, which has hung in the cathedral since the 17th 
century, according to cathedral officials.

Eight
of the nine new bells were cast in a foundry in the Normandy town of 
Villedieu-les-Poeles. The ninth - a ‘bourdon,’ or Great Bell, named 
Marie - was cast in the Netherlands and then sent to Normandy to join 
the others.

The president 
of the foundry rang the bells, to the cheers of onlookers, before the 
nine new bells were sent on a convoy of trucks Thursday from 
Villedieu-les-Poeles to Paris.

They
are joining the cathedral's oldest surviving bell, a Great Bell named 
Emmanuel, to restore the ten-bell harmony originally conceived for Notre
Dame's bell towers.

The arrival of the bells ‘is historic 
precisely because since the 18th century, we haven't experienced such an
event,’ said the cathedral's rector, Patrick Jacquin.

‘During the French Revolution, they (the
bells) were all brought down and broken except the great bell, 
Emmanuel, which is here and four other bells that were recast in the 
middle of the nineteenth century.... This will complete in a definitive
manner the entire set of 10 bells as conceived ... in the Middle Ages.’

The €2 million (£1.7 million) bell-casting project was funded via donations, cathedral officials say.

‘Historically the idea of this project was to recreate the old bells of Notre Dame in terms of power, in terms of tune, which means that there will be again 10 bells ringing into the cathedral as it used to be in the Middle Ages and up until the French Revolution,’ said Paul Bergamo, president of the Cornille-Havard Foundry in Villedieu-les-Poeles.

One of the new bells was named Jean-Marie, after Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, a Jewish-born convert to Catholicism whose mother was killed at the Auschwitz death camp and who later worked to reconcile Catholics and Jews. Lustiger was archbishop of Paris from 1981 to 2005; Jean-Marie was the name he adopted when he converted to Catholicism.

‘This is a wonderful return to history and at the same time an extraordinary leap forward because it means that with these bells we are going to endure for the centuries to come,’ said the rector.
