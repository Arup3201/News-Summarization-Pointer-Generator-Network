The father of Heath Ledger has said he is saddened to hear of the drug scandal surrounding Australian actor Ryan Corr, who received a scholarship named after the late Hollywood star.

Kim Ledger, who presented Corr with an Australians in Film Heath Ledger Scholarship in 2011, also said he had no 'empathy' for people who take drugs.

Corr has been charged after being found in possession of heroin in a laneway in Bondi, Sydney, in May.

'It does make me sad to hear that because we have enough problems with alcohol and drugs,' Mr Ledger told The Sydney Morning Herald.

Photos have emerged of the actor, who has just been charged with drug posession, from May 2013, where he can be seen at bus stop in Sydney's Kings Cross

'I have some empathy for what happens around that situation with families but very little empathy for people that put it in their own mouth.

'We do what we can to help people but we're not involved in the pro-active side of it.'

The 25-year-old former Packed To The Rafters star was arrested on May 27 after he was found in Castlefield Lane by police.

A New South Wales court case officer confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that Corr was due to appear in court on Tuesday in relation to being in possession of drugs and illegal substances. He did not appear and is due back in court on September 2.

Corr can also be seen smoking cigarettes while moving around the area, leaving a blue bag on the seat of the bus stop

Pictures and video footage of Corr have also emerged from May last year of him smoking, pacing back and forth and talking on his phone near a bus stop in Sydney's Kings Cross.

'The man was allegedly in possession of a small amount of a prohibited drug,' New South Wales police told Daily Mail Australia.

'He was issued with a Field Court Attendance Notice for possession of a prohibited drug and appeared at Waverley Local Court on July 8. The matter was adjourned for mention on September 2'.

It was confirmed the substance was heroin and he was found with one freezer bag containing white powder, court documents say.
