It has been revealed Indonesia is considering putting a moratorium on the death penalty as the country is just days away from killing convicted drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukuraman.

This news emerged during a panel discussion at the United Nations' Human Rights Council in Geneva, with more than 24 countries - including Indonesia and Australia - in attendance.

At the meeting, which aims for the 'abolition of the death penalty', UN assistant secretary-general Ivan Simonovic called the practice an 'inhuman and outdated punishment'.

Just days before the impending executions of Myuran Sukuraman (left) and Andrew Chan (right), Indonesia has revealed it could be reinstating its moratorium on the death penalty

He told the gathered countries there was no evidence death row stopped criminal activity, the UN News Centre reported.

Mr Simonovic added it was 'too often applied to the poor and marginalised foot soldiers' rather than on those who were leading drug organisations.

During the meeting, human rights organisation Franciscans International urged nations - singling out Indonesia - that still dole out the death penalty to adopt a moratorium and grant mercy to inmates on death row.

In response, Indonesia diplomats said the death penalty was a constant topic discussed by their country, according to a summary of the debate.

They also called on the countries that still had the death penalty to observe the full process of law.

The officials went on further to say Indonesia already had a moratorium in place and could reinstate it for crimes they thought were most serious.

In 2013, Indonesia executed its first prisoners after a four-year stay on executions, Fairfax Media reported.

This comes as Australia plans to lodge an official complaint with Indonesia's Ambassador, Nadjib Kesoema, at their outrage and ethical displeasure with images of a Balinese police chief posing and smiling with Chan and Sukuraman during their transfer to Nusakambangan for their execution.

The complaint is over images of a Balinese police chief posing and smiling with the Bali Nine duo, which caused outrage

One of the pictures depicts Djoko Hari Utomo, the police chief of the Balinese capital of Denpasar, placing his hand on Andrew Chan's shoulder and smiling for the camera.

Another shows his hand on the shoulder of Myuran Sukumaran who was captured gazing up at the officer.

Although summoned to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Ambassador Kesoema is understood to be in Perth and cannot appear at the in person.

A senior official, likely to be department secretary Peter Varghese will inform the ambassador of Australia's shock at the images through a telephone call whilst also appealing again for clemency.

The police chief has denied it was a 'selfie moment', saying he was telling the Bali Nine duo to stay strong, according to Fairfax Media. 

Chan and Sukuraman are spending their second night on Nusakambangan, awaiting their execution at Besi prison

The pair are being kept in cells in semi-isolation with a toilet and tiny washing area - a stark contrast to their group cells in Bali's Kerobokan prison

It is expected the Australians will meet their fate by firing squad this weekend after they were transferred from Bali on Wednesday
