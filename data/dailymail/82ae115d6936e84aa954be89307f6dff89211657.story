After a 24-year career as a desk clerk in the RAF, John Wildey, 77, had spent plenty of time looking at planes but had never taken the controls.

But all that changed after a pleasure flight to Skegness turned into a nightmare when Mr Wildey's friend and pilot was suddenly taken ill and died during the flight.

Now, six months after making headlines after being forced to make an emergency landing solo and in the dark, Mr Wildey is to tell the full story for the first time as part of a new Channel 4 documentary.

Terrifying: John Wildey had a brush with death after his pilot friend tragically passed away during a flight

'We were having a good flight, we were enjoying it and picking out landmarks. It was just a day out and we were enjoying ourselves,' explains Mr Wildey of the moments leading up to his friend's death.

'It was getting late evening, the weather was good, we had about another hour to get down before the end of daylight.'

But just a few miles from the Sandtoft air base where the two men were due to land, disaster struck when the pilot suddenly revealed that he felt ill.

'He said he felt sick, so I said, "Don't be sick on my trousers!",' remembers Mr Wildey. 'I asked if we stop should somewhere and he said no, so we went on.

'Then he asked me to take the controls for a moment and then he leaned back and started breathing rapidly.

Flights to and from Humberside were suspended or diverted as the runway was cleared for an emergency landing

Mr Wildey was guided to safety by two flying instructors who had been called in to help land the aircraft at Humberside Airport

'He began hyperventilating and threw his head back. I thought he'd fainted or something at first and then I tried to feel for a pulse because his hand was hanging down.

'I just thought, "Well what do I do now?" I thought, "I'm going to have to fly this thing." It was a Houston, we have a problem moment. I pressed the transmit button on the console and I called: Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.'

Emergency services were quickly scrambled on the ground but Mr Wildey had to be diverted to the bigger airport at Humberside, where the runways were swiftly cleared of traffic in anticipation of a crash landing.

'I was trying to keep as calm as possible
 because I knew if I didn't, I'd lose everything,' adds Mr Wildey. 'I've had my skin for 
77 years and I'd like to keep it for a few more years.'

By now, Mr Wildey's Cessna aircraft had been joined by an RAF Search and Rescue team from nearby RAF Leconfield while in the control tower at Humberside, instructor Russell Murray had arrived to coach Mr Whitley through the perilous descent.

Roy Murray, chief instructor at the airport's Frank Morgan Flying School was called at his home in the Waltham, Lincolnshire

'I was OK guiding the plane but landing was a different proposition,' says Mr Wildey. 'I just couldn't 
position myself. And I was looking for the runway but I couldn't see a 
thing. I don't know how I high I was. All I could see was the black.'

After three aborted landing attempts, Mr Wildey was becoming increasingly thirsty and tired, while on the ground, his would-be rescuers were preparing for the worst.

'I could have paid a million quid for a 
drink at that time,' he remembers. 'I think it was the adrenaline kicking in but I was 
so dry that it hurt.'

One-and-a-half hours after first taking control of the plane, Mr Wildey geared up for his fourth attempt at landing.

'I didn't want to go round again if I could help it. I just wanted to come in and get down - and I was gagging for a drink,' he says.

Former RAF ground crewman John Wildey, 77, landed the light aircraft he had been a passenger in after the pilot collapsed at the controls

'I
 brought it down to do the approach and it was then I could hear them 
[air traffic control] say, "He's diving now". I just thought, "It's going down now, I'm doing 
it - just get down!"'

One bumpy landing that saw the Cessna skew off the runway and into a patch of grass later, and Mr Wildey's nightmare was finally over.

But his relief that he was alive was tinged with sadness as his pilot friend, rushed to hospital by medics, was pronounced dead later that night.

Mr Wildey, by contrast, is relieved he's still alive. 'It 
was an Andy Warhol moment for me wasn't it,' he sighs.

'Iâ€™m a pretty lucky bloke 
anyway - I went and bought a lottery ticket that week and got Â£6.70 so 
there must be something right.'
