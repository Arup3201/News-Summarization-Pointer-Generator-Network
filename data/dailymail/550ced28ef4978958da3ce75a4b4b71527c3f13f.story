Foreign criminals are being targeted in a nationwide police operation – using European officers patrolling the streets with their British counterparts.

Police from eight European countries including Lithuania, Poland and Latvia are spending a week in the UK, in a bid to clamp down on foreign criminals flouting the rules of the road.

The European officers will help British police tap into European police systems to make sure fake details are not handed over.

This week's nationwide traffic operation - codenamed Operation Trivium - is being coordinated by West Midlands Police.

Police who stop any vehicles registered in one of the eight countries will be able to immediately discover if the driver or passengers are wanted.

It is thought there are about 350,000 foreign-registered cars on British roads at any one time, and about 3000 of those are suspected to be linked to crime.

West Midlands Police Superintendent Paul Keasey, said: 'Foreign nationals who commit crime in the UK, and who use the road network to facilitate that criminality, may feel untouchable by UK police forces - but operations like this demonstrate our commitment to cross-border policing and that borders are no barrier to justice.

'I'm delighted to welcome colleagues from police forces in Europe. They will join us on operations and their support is invaluable: they will have instant access to intel systems at home and be able to question drivers in their mother tongue, assess their demeanour and attitude, and better detect if they are co-operating with officers.

'In the past we've arrested people for crimes ranging from motoring offences to human trafficking, money laundering, GBH and fraud, as well as motoring offences like driving with no insurance or licence.'

A Czech national wanted for 23 offences and a Slovakian man suspected of running a human trafficking ring were among the arrests on Day One of Operation Trivium − a operation targeting foreign criminals in the UK.

West Midlands Police officers − accompanied by Lonut Preda from Romania's Traffic Division − spotted the 28-year-old Czech man in Birmingham city centre travelling in a car linked to vehicle insurance fraud.

Checks made at the Operation Trivium control centre in Edgbaston − where European intelligence officers have direct access to police systems at home − showed he was wanted on a European Arrest Warrant for offences including burglary and robbery.

He will now be transported to Westminster Magistrates Court and faces deportation to the Czech Republic to face the charges.

And another man wanted on a European Arrest Warrant − a 34-year-old Slovak suspected of being involved in trafficking people to the UK − was arrested after being found hiding at an address in Handsworth's Headingly Road.

Superintendent Keasey, said: 'The Operation brings together police forces across Europe, plus Europol, to share information on criminals and emerging crime trends.

'It's been a hugely successful start to the Operation and the overseas officers have proved invaluable when we've encountered foreign nationals on roads patrols − and they will also be involved in several planned raids.'

All 43 police forces across the UK are taking part in Operation Trivium and running checks on people and vehicles through the control centre in Birmingham.

In the first 24 hours, a total of 875 cars have been stopped nationally, 109 seized and 55 people arrested. A further 517 were handed on-the-spot fines for minor traffic offences, cautioned or summonsed to court.

Arrests of foreign nationals were made yesterday in Cornwall, Hertfordshire, Surrey, Essex and Merseyside for offences including burglary, robbery, fraud and drugs trafficking.

And already this morning several foreign-plated vehicles have been seized for motoring offences, including a minibus at Junction 3 of the M5 that was found running on 'red' diesel. Immigration checks are being carried out against the 13 passengers on board.

Supt Keasey, added: 'It's important to stress we're targeting criminals, not the communities these offenders hail from. Many people settle in the UK from Eastern Europe, make efforts to integrate, work and make a positive contribution to society.

'But it's those who try using borders to cover their criminal tracks that Operation Trivium targets through an international show of strength.'
