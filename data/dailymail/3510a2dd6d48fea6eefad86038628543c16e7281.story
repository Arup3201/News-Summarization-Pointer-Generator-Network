Immigrants in Calais who are desperate to reach Britain have complained to charities that the free food being handed out to them is not spicy enough.

Many were accused of being ‘pampered’ after they rejected the meals offered in northern France by the aid association Salam.

The group’s spokesman, Jean-Claude Lenoir, said it was ‘very disappointing’ that some went without a meal because of the row.

‘The leaders staged a small protest and prevented the others from coming to eat,’ he said. ‘This was unacceptable.’

Mr Lenoir said the meal was ‘a lot less salty and not very spicy’ compared with what was usually served.

He said spices are ‘very expensive’, and went on to criticise the refugees.

‘I find that they’re a bit too pampered by now,’ he said.

‘As soon as 15 or 20 refused the meal, I stepped in to tell them if they didn’t want the food we could put it away and that it was scandalous,’ he said. 

Around 2000 migrants sleep rough in Calais as they try to board ferries to the UK

Referring to the tough economic circumstances in his home country, Mr Lenoir said: ‘Many in France don’t even have an evening meal.’

While aid workers were happy to help the migrants, ‘there are limits with regards to what we can propose’.

 There was no violence during the protest against the food being served, and some of the migrants apologised afterwards.

A dozen illegal immigrants travelling in the back of a refrigerated lorry on the M6 were discovered yesterday after one dialled 999 because he was so cold.

Police had to close the motorway during morning rush hour after the ‘distressed’ illegal immigrant asked for an ambulance, begging for ‘urgent assistance’ in broken English. He dialled 999 because it was said to be the only phone number he knew in the UK.

The call was traced and police pulled the lorry on to the hard shoulder near Hilton Park Services near Cannock, Staffordshire. Officers were stunned to see a dozen poorly-dressed men emerge shivering from the back of the lorry.

The M6 was shut for two hours as the men – believed to be from North Africa and the Middle East – were examined. The driver of the lorry was being questioned by police last night.

There are currently 2,000 migrants sleeping rough in the Calais area as they try to get aboard ferries to Britain. There, many will claim asylum, so gaining access to free housing and social security benefits.

Over the summer, Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart threatened to close the docks following an attempt by scores of mainly Eritreans and Sudanese to storm a ferry.

Ms Bouchart said she wanted ‘far more help from the British government’ to deal with people attempting to cross the Channel illegally.

The number of migrants in Calais has increased sharply in the past few months, and hundreds more are also camping out near other Channel ports, including Dunkirk and Cherbourg. All play a nightly game of cat-and-mouse with the police as they attempt to break into lorries that are heading for the UK.

The migrants are mainly from Somalia, Sudan and Eritrea, and have crossed to Italy before travelling through mainland Europe.

Violent clashes between rival migrant groups and people smugglers have also broken out in Calais.

According to the Calais Prefecture, 7,414 undocumented migrants were arrested in Calais in the first six months of this year, compared with 3,129 detained in the same period of 2013. Most of those detained are soon released.
