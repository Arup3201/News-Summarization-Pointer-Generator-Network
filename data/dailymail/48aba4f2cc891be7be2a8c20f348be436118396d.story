A man who fell head-first from a four-storey hotel balcony has had his skull re-built using a 3D printer.

Jon Fenton, 27, was on holiday in Barcelona last summer when he slipped and plunged onto a concrete roof.

Astonishingly, he survived after his face acted 'like a crumple zone', protecting his brain from serious injury.

After breaking every bone in his face and all four limbs, Mr Fenton (pictured today) was flown back to Britain for reconstructive surgery. Doctors used a 3D printer to create a model of his crushed skull - which they then used to rebuild his face

After breaking every bone in his face and all four limbs, he was flown back to Britain the following month for reconstructive surgery.

Specialists at the Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham used a 3D printer to create of a model of his crushed skull.

During a painstaking 14-hour operation, surgeons in the maxillofacial department broke and re-set almost every bone in his face into the correct position to repair his caved-in features.

This week he returned to his home in Beechdale, Nottingham, for the first time since his fall and is now planning to marry fiancé Rachel, 23, later in the year.

Mr Fenton and Miss West were staying at a £100-a-night four star hotel in 
Barcelona, when he toppled over the balcony while admiring the view of 
the city.

Mr Fenton, who works at B&Q, had been balancing on a chair to get a better view of 
Barcelona.

He said: 'I don't remember the
 fall, but I fell over a chair. I was trying to get a good view of the 
city and must have tripped over it and went over the balcony.

'All I can remember is falling four storeys - about 35ft - onto a concrete garage roof.

'From then on, my fiance filled me in on what happened. Coming back round, I had no idea. I woke a few days afterwards and my mum and dad were there and I didn't know why they were on holiday with me.

"They explained what happened. When I was in hospital it was very scary. I was on a hell of a lot of drugs and I was absolutely out of it.

'I had operations in Spain - surgery on my kneecaps, femur and my hip. I was in a bed in Barcelona for six weeks recovering before I was finally fit enough to fly back to Britain.'

During a 14-hour operation at the 
Queen's Medical Centre, surgeons used pictures of Mr Fenton before his 
accident to rebuild his features.

 Forward, who is consultant in orthopaedic trauma at the QMC, said: 'Mr 
Fenton had basically broken everything - his case was pretty much up 
there with as
 bad as it gets. All four limbs were severely broken.

'His face almost acted as a crumple zone for his 
head, but it meant that his brain wasn't seriously injured and his chest
 and abdomen weren't seriously injured.

He added: 'You need to be on the fifth floor or above for 50 per cent of people to die - the body is a pretty amazing thing.'

Mr Fenton's surgeon said: 'His teeth were misaligned, his cheeks were splayed so his eyes were far apart. He looked like something out of the film Predator'

'He
 came back from Spain having never been out of bed and hadn't made much 
progress. Within a day here he was out of bed and getting going.'

Explaining the reconstruction process, his colleague Dr
 Dilip Srinivasan, who oversaw the process, added: 'We make the model 
and that gives us the exact view of the injury that we have. From there 
we can plan things and get ready to operate.

'It was 14 hours - it's a big undertaking. We had to break nearly all the bones in his face. It's like a jigsaw.

Jason
 Watson, consultant maxillofacial prosthetist at the Queen's Medical 
Centre, explained how the surgical team were forced to re-break all 26 
bones in Mr Fenton's face.

He
 said: 'The medical teams in Barcelona basically patched Jon up and made
 sure he would survive but when he arrived home his face was a mess.

'His teeth were misaligned, his cheeks 
were splayed so his eyes were far apart. He looked like something out of
 the film Predator.

'We took his CT scans and put it through some software which showed his skull in 3D.

'We were able to print this off on a 3D printer so we could examine his injuries and decide where we started.'

He added that surgeons could practice operating on the 3D model before surgery which helped plan the operation.

'What the surgeons had to do first was remove all the plates in his face which had been inserted in Spain.

'Some of the bones had fused together in positions which we didn't want so we had to basically break them again.'

Mr Watson explained: 'There are 26 bones in the human face and Jon had broken or smashed all of them.

'We started with straightening his teeth and bringing his top jaw forward so it met the bottom.

'This
 helped improve his ability to speak, eat and swallow. His cheek bones 
were then re-positioned and his eyes were brought into a straighter 
line.

Mr Fenton (pictured before the accident) said: 'The surgeons have literally given me my life back'

'His nose was a challenge because it was totally smashed in the fall. Surgeons grafted bone from his skull and rebuilt his nose from scratch.

'In all we inserted around 20 metal plates into his face which he will probably have for life.'

'It's
 complex but it's about planning well. We have to break it into small 
pieces and take a bit at a time. This is not an everyday thing.

'We're quite pleased, but it's about Jon and whether he is happy. There's still more work to be done.

'However we have one 
of the best labs in the country and the quality of the work here is 
fantastic and that makes our job so much easier.

'The biggest reward is when patients say they are happy.'

Mr Fenton said: 'The surgeons have literally given me my life back. The work the staff here do is incredible. 

'I will keep working with the doctors and
 I will make it back to my best. I am so grateful. I know now to take 
life every day and enjoy it.'

Mr Fenton, who has lost four stone since his accident, now requires weekly physiotherapy sessions to help him walk and regain full movement of his facial muscles

His fiance Rachel, a trainee accountant, added: 'The surgeons have just been fantastic with him. It's a unique case and they have been so supportive.

'It's given us the chance to look forward to something nice - our wedding. It's not been the best year but we're really positive now.

'Six months ago everything was looking really bad but his face operation has gone so well and he looks so much better. Before he was quite disfigured.

'It's been a long year but it does feel as though there's light at the end of the tunnel.'
