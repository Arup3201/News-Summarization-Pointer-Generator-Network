Suspended: Derbyshire's Chief Fire Officer Sean Frayne has been charged with a 2006 rape

The most senior fire officer in Derbyshire has been suspended after being charged with rape.

Sean Frayne, who is Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service's chief executive, was charged over an alleged incident in Etwall near Derby in 2006.

A Derbyshire Police spokesman said the 47-year-old married father-of-three is scheduled to appear at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court at the end of the month after being charged yesterday.

In a statement, a police spokesman said: 'Derbyshire Constabulary can confirm that Sean Frayne has been charged with an offence of rape of a woman (16 years of age and over) under the Sexual Offences Act 2003.'

'Mr Frayne, 47, of Etwall, who was arrested in February 2014, was charged yesterday afternoon and is due to appear at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court on Monday, March 31.

'The charge relates to an alleged incident in Etwall in December 2006.'

Frayne, who is paid £140,000 a year, manages an annual budget of £40 million, and has 1,000 staff under his command, became Derbyshire's most senior fire officer in March 2010 when his predecessor, Brian Tregunna, retired.

Janine Smith, Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in the East Midlands, said: 'CPS East Midlands can confirm that we have authorised Derbyshire police to charge Sean Frayne with rape in relation to an incident in 2006.'

'The evidence has been reviewed by a specialist senior crown prosecutor from the CPS rape and serious sexual offences team, who has decided that there is sufficient evidence to charge and that it is in the public interest for a prosecution to take place.'

Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service 
and the county's fire authority said Frayne had been suspended from 
his post until further notice following the charge.

Accused: Sean Frayne was arrested in connection with the alleged rape in February but the 47-year-old married father-of-three was suspended from his job after being charged yesterday

In
 a statement, the brigade said: 'Derbyshire's deputy chief fire officer 
Andy Waldie and deputy chief executive, Joy Smith will cover the 
responsibilities of the chief fire officer and chief executive in the 
short term.'

Frayne started his training as a firefighter in 1985 in Yorkshire at the age of 19 after leaving school at 17 to work for a building society.

By his mid-20s, he had moved to work in a training centre, becoming a recruit instructor.

Jobs as a leading firefighter, sub-officer and station officer followed before he transferred to Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service in October 1997.

His first job in Derby was as station commander at Nottingham Road Fire Station.

He progressed to the service’s headquarters in Littleover, where he was promoted to assistant and then deputy chief fire officer before being appointed to the top post in 2010.
