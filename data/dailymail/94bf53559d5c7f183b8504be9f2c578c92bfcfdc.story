Cricket Australia has paid tribute to former Test player Gary Gilmour who has died at the age of 62.

The all-rounder - who had been ill for some time - played 15 Tests for the Baggy Green.

One of his finest hours came when he dismantled England in the 1975 World Cup semi-final when he took six wickets for 14.

All-rounder: Gary Gilmour will be remembered for his ability with bat and ball

He took 54 Test wickets as the 267th man to represent Australia.

CA chief executive officer James Sutherland said: 'Gary was a captivating talent who had the rare ability to single-handedly turn a game.

'Anyone who witnessed Gary in full flight during the 1970s will remember fondly how he could influence matches with his all-round abilities.'

Current coach Darren Lehmann added: 'On behalf of the Australian cricket team, I take this opportunity to pass on our condolences to the Gilmour family following the passing of Gary earlier today.'
