A hiker told last night how stricken soldiers pleaded for water during an exercise in the Brecon Beacons in which two servicemen died of heat exhaustion.

David Capstick described how he passed a ‘distressed’ infantryman being helped by a colleague as temperatures neared 30C in the mountains.

He spoke as a soldier who died during the tough SAS selection exercise was yesterday named as Lance Corporal Craig Roberts, 24.

Loss: Lance Corporal Craig Roberts, one of the two soldiers who died in the Brecon Beacons on Saturday in military exercises in extreme heat

He was one of two Territorial Army 
troops who lost their lives taking part in a 17-mile march in the Welsh 
mountains on the hottest day of the year so far.

Despite the tragedy, the Army was 
yesterday pressing ahead with military exercises in the remote and 
rugged area, which is used to put both regular and special forces 
through their paces.

100lb burden: The pile of hit which soldiers have piled upon them

Mr Capstick told Channel 4 that he and a group of 
other walkers had seen two troops making slow progress as they passed in
 the opposite direction.

‘One of the soldiers made a 
compassionate plea for some drinking water for his colleague,’ he said. 
‘I don’t think it occurred to us that fatalities were going to result.

‘But it certainly was slightly odd 
that the two soldiers in particular had bunched together and were 
clearly in distress. That caused a little bit of alarm among us.

‘But it was a military exercise and you do expect, I suppose, that they are under duress and discomfort.’

Mark Nash, who was walking with Mr Capstick said they gave water to two soldiers they saw in difficulty, but added that they were not the two who died.

He said: We have them half a litre into their canteen. The said 'thank you' and that they were going to replenish their stock in a stream.

'They said they didn't need that much off us because there was a load of military trucks about half an hour along the track.'

Mr Capstick said one soldier was ‘upset’ and asked for water for his colleague rather than himself.

‘It must 
have taken quite a lot for the soldier to ask some civilian hikers for 
help,’ added Mr Capstick.

‘Well, we know from our own 
experience that those streams were no more than a line of arid rocks. 
There was no water to be had from them.’

A third soldier is still in a 
critical condition in hospital, while another three men fell ill during 
tests to join the elite regiment’s reserve unit.

Military chiefs have ordered an 
inquiry into the exercise and how the victims were monitored on one of 
the Army’s most unforgiving training areas, in which troops were 
carrying kit including a 50lb backpack, SA80 assault rifle and 
ammunition.

However, bosses say the routine 
exercises will continue as normal. ‘We have taken measures to try to 
make sure this does not happen again,’ said a source.

Dyfed-Powys Police are also probing the deaths on the rugged landscape close to the 2,900ft peak of Pen y Fan.

He had taken part in exercises several times including a training mission in Texas with the American National Guard - which incorporated hot weather training in the desert aimed at replicating conditions in the Middle East.

Lance Corporal Roberts’ family are 
being comforted by friends at the family home in Penrhyn Bay, North 
Wales. His parents Kelvin, 53, and Margaret, 54, were described as 
‘heartbroken’ at the death.

Mr Roberts said: ‘We are being given the support of the military and anything we want to say will come through them.’

Lance Corporal Roberts, who had 
served with the TA for more than five years, was a member of the 3rd 
Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment. He is believed to have served as a 
reservist in Iraq and Afghanistan and with United Nations peacekeepers 
in Cyprus. 

Sources indicated the tragedy was caused by heat exhaustion. A third soldier remains in hospital

Welsh beauty spot: Army chiefs say the rugged and sprawling terrain helps prepare soldiers physically and mentally for war

A keen sportsman, he graduated from Leicester University with a degree in banking and was a former financial consultant.

His current job was a teaching  maths
 at Trinity Comprehensive School in Lewisham, south London, which 
yesterday sent letters to parents and pupils telling them of his death. 
Friends described Lance Corporal Roberts – nicknamed ‘CJ’ – as 
‘extremely dedicated’. One said: ‘CJ loved being in the TA and really 
wanted to go as far as he could.

‘He was the salt of the earth and 
would have a go at anything. It is devastating to think how he died like
 that.’ The second soldier who died has not been named.

The victims were among about 100 TA 
troops starting a week-long period of assessment to join the SAS 
reserves. Successful candidates must complete the course in roughly four
 hours.

An Army source said: ‘The balance of 
pushing soldiers to their limit within difficult weather conditions and 
within their own physical capability is a constant challenge.

‘Often the methods used would not be acceptable within line infantry regiments.’
