The daughter of famed photographer Alberto Korda is selling a gallery of his 'vintage' images of Fidel Castro and revolutionary Che Guevara in the UK for £50,000.

The 55 black and white snaps are the first set of prints made by the political photographer from his original negatives that he shot in the 1950s and 1960s.

The pictures, being made available by Norka Korda, include the Cuban leader and Marxist Guevara on a fishing trip soon after Castro's communist regime came to power.

Iconic: The photos show Guevara in a green army uniform stood in a 'teapot' pose while holding a club

One snap depicts Guevara, who played a major role in the Cuban Revolution in 1959, relaxing with his feet up on the fishing boat while reading a book.

Other pictures depict Castro and Guevara playing a famous round of golf together on the Caribbean island in 1961.

The round was a publicity stunt that poked fun at U.S. president Dwight D Eisenhower who two years earlier had snubbed meeting the new Cuban leader to play golf.

The golf photos show Guevara wearing a green army uniform measuring up a putt and then stood in a 'teapot' pose while holding a club.

There is an incredible snap of Castro taking a Polaroid picture of Nikita Khrushchev, the president of the Soviet Union, and his family during a trip to Russia in 1963.

Another print shows Korda's favourite photo which depicts a young Cuban girl clutching a piece of wood that she pretended was a doll as her family couldn't afford a toy one.

Korda later said the 1959 image was the turning point in his career as it led to him dedicating his work to the revolution to remove 'social inequalities'.

All the pictures have been signed by Korda, who was Castro's personal photographer and died in 2001 aged 72.
