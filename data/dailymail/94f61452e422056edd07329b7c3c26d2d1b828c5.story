Police must do more to report and track hate crimes so people can 'fully understand what is happening in our communities, and how to stop it,' the director of the FBI has said.

James Comey said some areas still fail to report hate crimes on their watch, while others say none occurred - 'a fact that would be welcome if true'.

Mr Comey spoke out less than two weeks after a white supremacist disowned as a 'loose cannon' by former Ku Klux Klan members was charged with shooting three people dead in Kansas, Texas.

Anger: FBI director James Comey said hate crimes 'strike at the heart of one's identity' and must be stopped

Accused: Frazier Glenn Cross in a court appearance last week. The 73-year-old white supremacist is accused of shooting dead three people including a 14-year-old boy at a Jewish community center in Kansas, Texas

Frazier Glenn Cross shouted 'Heil Hitler' to television cameras as he was arrested for the murders at a Jewish community center and a nearby Jewish retirement home.

Dr William Corporon, 69, was shot dead alongside his grandson Reat Underwood, 14. Also killed was 53-year-old Terri LaManno, who was visiting her mother at the retirement complex.

Investigators said Cross was 'trying to hurt someone based on race or ethnicity' in what has been interpreted as an anti-Semitic attack.

But it transpired that all three victims were Christians.

Speaking to a summit of the Anti-Defamation League yesterday, Mr Comey said 73-year-old Cross was a 'madman with a warped view of what America should look like'.

Last week it emerged Cross, who rose through the ranks of several white supremacist organizations, once entered the witness protection program for soliciting a black male prostitute who was dressed as a woman.

Accused: Cross previously appeared before a court dishevelled and in a sleeveless smock

Victims: Dr William Corporon, 69, his grandson Reat Underwood, 14, and 53-year-old Terri LaManno

Hate crimes are distinct from other crimes, Mr Comey said, because 'they strike at the heart of one's identity.'

He
 said: 'We must continue to impress upon our state and local 
counterparts in every jurisdiction the need to track and report hate 
crime.  It is not something we can ignore or sweep under the rug.'

The FBI publishes hate crime statistics, described as offenses motivated by a bias against a race, religion, sexual orientation or other traits, from local law enforcement data.

But those reports are generally incomplete because not all jurisdictions contribute information, Mr Comey said.

Warnings had already been raised about Cross, who went by the name Glenn Miller and wrote to white supremacist Kevin Harpham after he was sentenced to 32 years for planting a bomb at a Martin Luther King Day parade in Spokane, Washington, in 2011.

In August, he was mentioned as an example of dangerous anti-Semitic figures in a presentation to the Jewish community center by the Institute for Research & Education on Human Rights.

It wasn't clear what, if any, steps were taken by the center to act on the information.

The Anti-Defamation League also noted a sharp drop in anti-Semitic attacks less than two weeks before the shooting.

In a report on April 1, the civil rights organisation noted a 19 per cent drop in 2013 compared to 2012, part of what the group called a 'decade-long downward slide' and one of its lowest tallies since it started keeping such records in 1979.

Mr Comey told the annual summit in Washington that homegrown violent extremists pose a continuing threat, while the overseas threat from terrorism has continued to evolve along with new tactics and methods of communication.

Though al-Qaeda is less dominant than it used to be, its affiliates remain a 'top threat,' he said.

He added the FBI remained concerned about American citizens who are radicalized by fighting in countries like Syria.
