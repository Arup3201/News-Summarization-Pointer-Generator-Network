In the skies above northern France they were the deadliest of enemies. Yet there still remained time for chivalry among the First World War flying aces.

When a British plane was shot down in 1916 the German pilot followed the stricken aircraft and landed nearby to check the two-man crew had survived.

He then braved French and British fire to cross enemy lines and drop a letter to Allied forces telling them the pair were alive.

Sorry about that, old bean: The amazing tale of chivalry in the air in the First World War shows just how gentlemanly combatants were, even in the grim battle

Chivalry: German Ace Oswald Boelke risked his life to deliver the letter of the man he shot down

The astonishing tale of gentlemanly 
conduct in the heat of battle emerged yesterday when the letter and 
photographs of the incident were put up for auction.

It was on January 5, 1916, that the 
British single-engine biplane, crewed by pilot Lieutenant William 
Somervill and observer Lieutenant Geoffrey Formilli, took off on a 
reconnaissance flight from Lille.

Unfortunately, they encountered 
legendary flier Oswald Boelcke – known as the father of the German 
fighter air force and the aviator who trained the Red Baron, Manfred von
 Richthofen – roaming the skies in his Fokker E IV fighter.

Boelcke sprayed the British plane, a 
BE2c reconnaissance aircraft, with hundreds of rounds from his 
machine-guns, forcing it to crash land.

The German ace wrote about what 
happened when he landed and approached his two enemy airmen.

‘I went 
straight up to the Englishmen, shook hands with them and told them I was
 delighted to have brought them down alive,’ he wrote.

‘I had a long talk with the pilot, who spoke German well. When he heard my name he said with a grin, “We all know about you!”

‘I then saw to it that they were both
 taken in a car to the hospital where I visited the observer today and 
brought him some English papers and photos of his wrecked machine.’

Lieutenant Formilli then wrote a 
letter to a Captain Babington of the Royal Flying Corps that Boelcke 
dropped over the British lines.

The letter said: ‘Just a line to say 
that Somervill & I are alright. We had a scrap with a Fokker. Willy 
got a graze on the side of his head & I got one through the shoulder
 half way through.

‘We had most of our controls shot 
through & had to land & crashed very badly.

'I am in Hospital now
 & Willy is in Germany. Will you let my people know please, yours G 
Formilli. PS. It was Boelcke who brought us down.’

The letter was later forwarded to Formilli’s mother by a soldier, C F Murphy, who watched it being dropped by the German pilot.

Dropping a line: The chivalrous German visited the British observer Lt Geoffrey Formilli in hospital, and then incredibly undertook a perilous mission to drop a note from Formilli over his Squadron's HQ to let them know he was alive

Good news: The auction also contains the letter from Formilli's grateful Squadron commander to his parents confirming his survival

He wrote: ‘The German machine very 
sportingly held on through heavy shell fire from us and the French and 
was chased by several of our machines and had to run a hot gauntlet on 
its errand but it escaped all right.

‘The news has given us all great pleasure and I rejoice to be able to send it to you.’

The archive of letters and several 
photos taken by Boelcke – who downed 40 enemy planes before dying, aged 
25, after a mid-air collision with another German plane later in 1916 – 
is being sold by Formilli’s family through Mullock’s of Ludlow, 
Shropshire, later this month. It is expected to make a four-figure sum.

Richard Westwood-Brookes, from the saleroom said:  ‘This is an extraordinary tale that made headlines at the time.

‘Pilots at this time were quite gentlemanly even though they were trying to shoot each other down.’
