In front of a record 45,619-strong crowd at Wembley, this was supposed to be a new dawn for England’s Women as they came up against the second-best side in the world.

But ultimately their performance bore too much of a resemblance to their male counterparts: promising, but eventually leaving supporters wishing England could be as good as Germany.

Celia Sasic’s first-half brace and Alex Scott’s own goal condemned the home side to defeat on their first appearance at the national stadium, but they look to have won over a new generation of supporters, matching Germany all over the pitch, if not on the scoreline.

‘The attitude’s there, the character’s there, the spirit’s there,’ head coach Mark Sampson said. ‘3-0 down at half-time, it’s difficult to come out for the second half and do anything but hang on but the team wanted to keep going forward and I thought we did that well.

‘If you want to be competitive at major tournaments you’re going to have to find a way to beat teams like Germany. The lessons we’ll learn today are big going forward. They punished us when we lost a bit of tactical discipline off the ball.’

Captain Steph Houghton felt England matched the team she sees as the best in the world for long periods.

‘We’ve got to give credit to the Germans. They’re a world-class team, better than us and we’ve just got to take that on the chin,’ she said.

‘We’ve got seven months to go until the World Cup and we’ve got to go and try to improve as a team. There’s tactical and technical bits that we can learn as a team but we need to just make sure we need to keep working hard for each other as we can.

‘Overall when we reflect on this in a few days’ time when the emotions have calmed down we will realise that maybe the game wasn’t as bad as we thought it was and second half especially we can be really proud of ourselves.’

Arsenal midfielder Jordan Nobbs came closest for the Lionesses, rattling the bar from 25 yards out inside the opening eight seconds – but then Germany took over.

Melanie Behringer’s delivery was met at the near post by Scott, under pressure from Simone Laudehr, and the ball dropped into the far corner to put the visitors ahead after six minutes – greeted by booing from the Wembley crowd.

And five minutes later Sasic doubled the lead, breaking from her own half to confidently slot the ball under the onrushing Bardsley.

Over 45,000 fans turned out to watch England in the women's team's first ever game at the new Wembley

England recollected themselves and thought they had pulled one back with Nobbs’s looping header caught by the keeper, but goalline technology showed the ball had not crossed the line. No Lampard-esque controversy here.

And Bundesliga top scorer Sasic put the visitors out of sight on the stroke of half-time, nodding in her second from Tabea Kemme’s cross.

Substitutes Fran Kirby and Jill Scott went close after the break but by that time Germany knew the job was as good as done.

While England recorded 10 wins from 10 in World Cup qualifying, this acted as a reminder that they need to improve to beat the best with seven months to go until Canada 2015.
