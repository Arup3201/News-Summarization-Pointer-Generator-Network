Atletico Madrid have joined the race to sign Belgium striker Divock Origi from Lille after Liverpool failed to close a deal for the Belgium World Cup star.

The La Liga champions want £10million-rated Origi to help fill the gap left by striker Diego Costa, who signed for Chelsea this summer, according to Spanish paper Marca.

Origi travelled to Merseyside earlier this month as Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers tried to sign the striker but terms were not finalised with the 19-year-old.

Wanted: Spanish newspaper Marca claims Atletico Madrid are chasing Liverpool target Origi

Rising star: Origi scored for Belgium during the World Cup and netted five times for club side Lille last season

And that leaves the opportunity for Atletico, who are in desperate need of attacking reinforcements, to swoop.

Atletico boss Diego Simeone has already seen David Villa and Adrian leave the Vicente Calderon, along with Costa, and he is keen to bring in the Belgian striker. 

Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez and Chelsea forward Romelu Lukaku are also believed to be on Simeone's radar.

Origi scored once for Belgium during the World Cup and has made seven appearances for his country.

He made 35 appearances for French side Lille last season and netted on six occasions.
