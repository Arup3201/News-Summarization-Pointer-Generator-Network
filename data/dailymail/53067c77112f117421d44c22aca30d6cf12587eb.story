Honour: John Major is having a street named after him in Candeleda, Spain, where he has holidayed with his wife Norma, pictured, for nearly 25 years

Former Prime Minister John Major is to have a street named after him in a small Spanish town he has holidayed in for nearly 25 years.

The ex-Conservative Party leader enjoys an annual break every summer with his wife Norma and friends at former Foreign Office minister Tristan Garel-Jones's holiday home near Candeleda, two hours drive west of Madrid.

Now local politicians have decided to put the pretty town on the international map - and thank Mr Major for his support - by naming one of its main streets after him.

They have voted to call it Avenida de John Major or Avenida John Major - John Major Avenue in English.

Major, the oldest living former British Prime Minister, is expected to be invited to the official unveiling ceremony at the end of the month.

Councillor Rodrigo Munoz, spokesman for the local Popular Party which holds eight of the 13 council seats and proposed the street-naming idea, said: 'We obviously want to promote Candeleda and see this as an excellent way of achieving this objective.

'But it's also our way of saying thank you to Mr Major for choosing to holiday in our town when he was Prime Minister and repeating year after year. He obviously likes it here and we're delighted to receive him.

'I've enjoyed a beer with him in the town hall square the last couple of times he's been and he seems a very nice down-to-earth man who, although he doesn't speak Spanish, can say the odd word.'

The town, a popular weekend destination for tourists from Madrid, boasts one of Spain's highest mountains, the 8,500 Almanzor peak which Major can see from his holiday home when he stays.

Olmedo, where Nick Clegg holidays every summer with his Spanish wife and their three kids, is just a two-hour drive drive away in the neighbouring province of Valladolid.

Major has yet to take his annual break this summer in the town, where in the current political climate he risks being quizzed by locals about the rising tension between Spain and Britain over Gibraltar.

He first visited the area in 1989 when friend and Conservative Party colleague Tristan Garel-Jones invited him to stay at a country home near Candeleda which his Spanish wife inherited from her late father.

He used to be flown by helicopter from Madrid's Barajas Airport when he was holding the reigns of power, but now makes the two-hour journey by car.

A Spanish couple that look after the house all-year-round cook for him while he is there, making his favourite sangria and gazpacho, a cold tomato soap.

His favourite pastimes include reading and trekking in the Tietar Valley south of the Gredos Mountains which draw holidaymakers to the protected area.

The avenue set to be named after John Major is an amalgamation of two streets which include an old tobacco fermentation centre and a council-run sports complex and is soon set to become the HQ of the local police.

Mr Munoz said: 'It's one of the three access roads to the town and the road Mr Major uses when he comes into town from his friend's holiday home.

'My understanding is he has already been made aware of our plans to name a street after him through friends.

'We're holding an unveiling ceremony at the end of the month and will obviously invite him.

'We're still deciding whether to name the avenue Avenida John Major or Avenida de John Major.'
