In two minds: Gordon Brown has apparently changed his mind about how he felt when England beat Scotland during Euro 96

He once described Gazza’s wonder goal against the Scots at Wembley as one of his favourite footballing memories.

But Gordon Brown, who no longer courts the English vote, has now spoken of his heartbreak at watching Gary McAllister’s botched penalty for Scotland in that famous Euro ’96 match.

In a plea to Scots to vote against independence in September’s referendum, the former Prime Minister said he ‘yields to no-one’ in his love of Scotland.

He spoke fondly of his trips with the Tartan Army to Wembley, Spain, Italy and France and recalled Jim Baxter’s skills against then-world champions England in an historic 3-2 victory for the Scots in 1967.

Mr Brown also said he was as ‘humiliated’ as any Scot with the rugby team’s massacre at the hands of the Welsh in last weekend’s Six Nations match.

'The only comfort is that we were beaten by Wales, and not England,' he said.

His comments, made at an event in Perth where Labour is holding its annual Scottish conference, are a far cry from previous attempts to woo English sports fans when he was Chancellor and Prime Minister.

In the run-up to the 2006 World Cup, Mr Brown said: 'Two-thirds of all Scots want England to win, and I’m certainly one of them.

'[I have been to] lots of England matches, but the most memorable were the Euro 96 game against Scotland, with Gazza's great goal, and the 0-0 game in Rome the following year when England held on to qualify for France 98.'

Heartbreak With England up 1-0, Scotland were given a penalty which Gary McAllister has saved by David Seaman

At the time, SNP leader Alex Salmond said: 'I can't believe that any genuine Scottish football fan could believe that a goal scored against us was his most memorable moment.'

But Mr Brown was criticised once again in 2007 when he appeared to back England to host – and win – the 2018 World Cup.

He said he would like ‘the host’ to win such a contest, before adding: 'Of course, Scotland will do well.'

In the Euro ’96 match between the Auld Enemy, England were leading 1-0 when Scotland were awarded a penalty to level the match. David Seaman saved McAllister’s spot-kick, and the ball was fed to Paul Gascoigne.

In a moment of individual brilliance, Gazza then volleyed the ball past Andy Goram to hand England a famous 2-0 victory.

Mr Brown said: 'I yield to no one in my patriotic pride in being a Scot. I was there when Gary McAllister missed the penalty.

'I was there when Scotland were playing Brazil in Spain and David Narey scored that goal. I was there in Italy to watch Scotland in the World Cup, and in France to watch Scotland in the World Cup.'

He said Scots have made a great contribution to the Union, and said the ‘pooling and sharing’ of resources should continue.

Mr Brown also accused the SNP of promising tax cuts for ‘fat Nats’ if Scotland becomes independent.

He hit out at Mr Salmond’s bid to cut corporation tax levels, and threw his support behind a ‘mansion tax’ for Scots homeowners and a higher top rate of income tax.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister David Cameron has backed Scotland’s bid to host matches for football’s Euro 2020 tournament, which will be staged in cities across the continent.
