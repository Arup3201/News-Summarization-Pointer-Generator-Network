Paw in paw or snuggled up together - these might just be the cutest animal buddies ever.

While a dog might be man's best friend, it seems he also gets on very well with orangutans, according to this footage.

A Labrador playing with an elephant, a  lion cub enjoying a cuddle with a meerkat, a cat protecting baby chicks and a tortoise giving a wombat a ride all make it into phone-maker Android's best clips of odd animals pairings ever made for its latest advert.

Set to the Disney song Robin Hood And Little John the one-minute video is entitled Friends Furever and ends with the phrase 'be together. Not the same'.

Opening with an orangutan relaxing with his arm slung around a dog, the 60-second footage tells a magical tale that will melt even the hardest heart. 

From a lion cub and a bulldog trotting off into the sunset together to the adventures of a baby rhino and a goat, these pairings defy the laws of the animal kingdom. 

Unbelievably  this cat has adopted several baby chicks, keeping them warm with her own kittens
