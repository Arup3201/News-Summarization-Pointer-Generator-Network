Nearly naked lollipop men and women have taken to the streets in a bid to promote road safety. 

The results were captured on video and has received over two thousand views on YouTube thus far.

The video features a scantily-clad male and female model in hi-visibility underwear brandishing the classic road safety lollipop helping drunk passersby cross the road.

Now you look: An experiment was conducted by Road Safety Analysis to see if drunk people were more likely to use a zebra crossing if the lollipop men were dressed provocatively 

It was created by Road Safety Analysis after shocking new figures revealed one in eight pedestrians killed or seriously injured by cars were drunk.

While there has been a 48 per cent reduction in the number of child pedestrian injuries in the last ten years, the number of adults being killed or injured is rising.

The figures show that almost half of all drunk revellers fail to properly use a zebra crossing at night.

Safety first: The experiment came after it was revealed that one in eight pedestrians involved in car accidents were intoxicated 

Stop: The organisation are particularly concerned that accidents could rise of the festive period

The organisation are hoping that by 'sexing up' the lollipop men and women they might encourage more people to use a zebra crossing correctly. 

Richard Owen, operations director for safer roads, said that the growing number in accidents is worrying but it can be particularly concerning around the festive period. 

'At this time of year there is always a big focus on drink driving but drunk pedestrians are also a serious concern,' he said.

Success: As the video ends it is revealed that 98 per cent of pedestrians used the crossing correctly when the 'sexy' lollipop people were on duty

'Shockingly one in eight pedestrians who are killed or seriously injured on our roads are drunk at the time of the crash.'

As the video ends it points out that 98 per cent of the pedestrians used the zebra crossing correctly when the nearly naked lollipop people were on duty. 

Richard added that this experiment proves that people who are intoxicated can be encouraged to pay attention to road safety. 

'It can be very hard to connect with young adults, especially if they have been drinking, but what we have clearly demonstrated here is that their behaviour can be influenced if we can find the right means.'
