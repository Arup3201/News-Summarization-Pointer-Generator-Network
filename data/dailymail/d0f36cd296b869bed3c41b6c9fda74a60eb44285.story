Jack Leggett, nine, who tragically died before Christmas just two months on from being diagnosed with a brain tumour

A schoolboy who died from a brain tumour has saved the lives of three other children after his organs were donated.

Jack Leggett, nine, lost his battle with the condition just two months after being diagnosed.

His grieving parents, Alfie Leggett, 45, and Susan Clarkson, 47, say they are taking comfort from the fact Jack's memory will live on after his donated organs saved the lives of three seriously-ill youngsters just hours after his death.

Mrs Clarkson, a cleaner, said: 'Knowing Jack has saved lives has given me a hidden strength.

'At
 a time when I am hurting, deep inside I am proud of him. He would have 
given you his last penny, and so I know this is what he would have 
wanted. He is an inspiration.'

Mr Leggett, a postman, added: 'We were asked if he would want to donate organs, and we didn't hesitate.'

Within
 24 hours of his death, the family, of South Shields, South Tyneside, 
got a call to say Jack’s lungs had saved the life of another 
nine-year-old child.

Jack's kidney and liver were then used in other transplants.

Mr
 Leggett added: 'That is a fitting tribute to Jack. It is a comfort to 
us that other children and parents won't have to go through the same 
thing because of this organ donation.'

Jack's illness was discovered in October, when he had appeared to be suffering the same sickness virus as his brothers, twins James and Thomas, 11, but his parents became concerned as he was unsteady on his feet.

His parents took him to South Tyneside District Hospital and doctors then referred him to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary for further tests.

Within 24 hours their lives changed forever, as the couple were told Jack was suffering from an aggressive brain tumour, which was inoperable.

Mr Leggett added: 'You just ask yourself why it happens to a nine-year-old child. He wasn't given a proper chance at life.'

After being diagnosed on October 17, Jack underwent radiotherapy at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, five days a week for six weeks, as well as having weekly appointments at the RVI.

Jack was found unconscious by his mother at about 12.40am on Sunday and was rushed to South Tyneside District Hospital, before again being transferred to the RVI.

His parents had to make the heartbreaking decision to switch off his life support machine when doctors made it clear he couldn't be saved.

Mrs Clarkson added: 'His final wish was to become a superhero. That is what he has become in our eyes. Christmas this year was dreadful.

'The children came down and didn't know whether to open their presents or not. They have been staying strong for us and we have been trying to stay strong for them.'

Jack's funeral will be held at South Shields Crematorium at 11.30am on Tuesday, December 31. The family want it to be a celebration of a young life.

Donations in lieu of flowers can be made to CLIC Sargent, a children's charity that funds research and supports families of those suffering from cancers and tumours.

Jack's older brother, Ryan Clarkson, 20, has already begun raising cash for the charity by taking part in the Boxing Day Dip in South Shields.

Mourners – including school friends from Holy Trinity – will all wear something green, Jack's favourite colour while his coffin will be adorned by artwork of his superhero favourite Batman.

Mr Leggett added: 'CLIC Sargent is a charity that does a lot of good work for children. We want everyone to come along and give donations.'
