One in every 17 people could soon be claiming a disability benefit designed for those who cannot walk or get around.

Unless reforms proceed, the number being paid Disability Living Allowance will rise to 3.5million by 2015, according to Government forecasts seen by the Daily Mail.

This is more than three times the 1.1million who received the benefit when it was created in 1992. It is now going to tens of thousands with drug and alcohol problems, asthma and unspecified back pain.

The allowance, worth up to £125 a week, costs the taxpayer £12.6billion a year, almost the same as the Department for Transport’s entire £13billion budget.

Ministers will set out plans in the House of Lords tomorrow to replace DLA with a new benefit, but their proposals are expected to run into significant opposition following a series of defeats over other welfare reforms last week.

In a concession to disability groups, minister for disabled people Maria Miller will today agree to ditch plans to increase the period before claimants can qualify for a new disability benefit from three to six months.

The change was designed to deter people with temporary health problems from going on to disability handouts.

But critics including Tory Mayor of 
London Boris Johnson raised concerns that cancer patients might die 
before they could get support.

Ministers hope that maintaining the current three-month qualifying period for DLA will persuade sceptics in the Lords to back their plans.

The figures seen by the Mail suggest that the vast majority of those on the benefit get it for life without even a face-to-face interview.

Ministers say that under the current system, many can get DLA without any formal medical assessment, instead simply filling in a form.

Some 71 per cent of claimants have no further check-ups to see if their condition has changed.

Nick Clegg

Nick Clegg has triggered a Coalition row over welfare reform by demanding that the Government’s flagship ‘benefits cap’ is watered down.

The Deputy Prime  Minister is also considering an amendment removing child benefit payments from the cap – which may encourage feckless parents to have more children.

Plans for a benefits cap, unveiled in 2010, would ensure that no family will receive more than £26,000 a year in benefits – equal to average earnings.

But under Mr Clegg’s proposals, tens of thousands of existing families, mainly in London, could be given years of ‘transitional relief’, or even exempted from the cap altogether.

Lib Dems have sided with Labour and crossbench peers to defeat the Welfare Reform Bill, blowing a £2billion black hole in the Government’s spending plans.

The Coalition plans to scrap DLA and replace it with a new benefit, called the Personal Independence Payment (PIP).

Potential claimants will have a face-to-face interview and assessment before qualifying, followed by regular check-ups. PIP will reduce numbers of claimants aged between 16 and 64 by half a million, ministers will say.

But the 340,000 most severely disabled people will get the higher rate of benefit. The proportion who will receive the higher rate will actually increase under the Government’s reforms.

Mrs Miller told the Mail: ‘In the past, DLA has been poorly managed so we now have a situation where there are hundreds of millions of pounds of overpayments, and the vast majority of people get the benefit for life without systematic checks to see if their condition has changed.

‘We are replacing DLA with Personal Independence Payment and introducing a new face-to-face assessment and regular reviews – something missing under the current system.

'Under PIP, support will be focused on those who need it most, with a greater proportion getting the higher rates compared with DLA.’

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has pledged to slash £2.17billion from the vast annual bill for DLA by 2015.

Nearly a million people have been on the benefit for 14 years or more.

But cuts to DLA, which was designed to help people who have specific mobility or care needs, and cannot do tasks such as walking, washing or  dressing themselves, are under increasing criticism by charities and Opposition MPs.

Department for Work and Pensions figures show that the mobility component of DLA is paid to 19,400 people with drug or alcohol problems, 30,900 people with asthma and 128,300 people with ‘unspecified’ back pain.
