A builder was sacked after being caught on camera urinating in a tenant's back garden as he worked to fix her broken fence.

Tracey Croft, 43, secretly filmed the contractor relieving himself while he worked on the semi-detached property in Dartford, Kent.

Miss Croft had installed a CCTV camera to the back wall of her house after she suspected the builders were not doing their work properly.

Tracey Croft, 43, secretly filmed a builder relieving himself against a wall in her back garden in Dartford, Kent

Miss Croft's had installed CCTV at the back of her house after suspecting the builders, who were there to fix a broken fence, were not carrying out their job properly

But she was 'totally disgusted' when she looked back on the footage - and saw one of the builders shamelessly spending a penny.

The camera captured a man, who was wearing a white polo shirt and blue jeans, urinating against a wall at the side of the garden.

Although the film did not show the man's genitals, it clearly shows the man doing up the flies on his trousers after the incident.

It then shows the builder having a quick puff on a cigarette, before continuing with his work.

Miss Croft, who said she was 'totally disgusted', used the video as 
evidence to complain to Dartford Borough Council, through whom she rents
 her house

Miss Croft, who had waited months for workers to fix her fence, used her video as evidence to complain to Dartford Borough Council, through whom she rents her house.

She also showed the council footage of the builders putting out cigarettes on her patio and wiping 
muddy boots on her pathway.

She said: 'I was totally disgusted at the disrespect. He didn't ask if he could go to the loo - if he had, I would have let him use the toilet.

'It's unacceptable and it's certainly not professional. I wouldn't treat people's property like that.

The film showed the man standing up and urinating, before doing up his flies on his trousers and having a quick smoke of a cigarette

Breyer B-Line branch manager John Cosgrove apologised to Miss Croft, offered to pay her £200 compensation and said the contractor was sacked over the incident

'I said I don't want them on my property - it's not good enough, they kept letting me down.'

Contractor Breyer B-Line said the builder had been sacked over the incident. It also offered to pay Miss Croft £200 compensation.

But Miss Croft said: 'They said allow them two weeks (for the compensation), but it's still not arrived.

'I chased them up on Monday, but they're just not taking me seriously.'

John Cosgrove, Breyer B-Line branch manager, said: 'We've written apologising for the incident and the operative concerned has been disciplined and dismissed. It was unacceptable behaviour and we've dealt with it.'

He said the work had been completed and compensation had been arranged through Dartford Borough Council.
