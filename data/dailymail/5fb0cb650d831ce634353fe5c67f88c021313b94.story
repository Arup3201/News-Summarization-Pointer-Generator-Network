The widower of a nurse who died in a car accident after a grueling 12-hour shift is now suing her former hospital for allegedly 'working her to death'.

Jim Jasper's wife Beth died last March 16, after falling asleep behind the wheel while driving home after a night shift at The Jewish Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Mr Jasper is now suing the Mercy Health Group for causing her death, claiming that the stress of extra hours caused by under staffing led to the fatigue that caused her accident.

Worked to death: Wife and mother Beth Jasper died last March 16 returning from a 12 hour night shift at a hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio. Her widower Jim is now suing the hospital for causing her death

Fell asleep behind the wheel: According to the lawsuit filed last week, Beth's supervisor voiced concern to hospital management that the nurse was being 'worked to death'

Beth was the mother of their two young children, a 6-year-old son and an 11-year-old daughter, who have been having a hard time dealing with her untimely passing.

'It's been rough on them, expecting mom to come home from work and she didn't come home from work,' he told WLWT.

According to the lawsuit filed by the family's attorney Eric Deters, Beth's supervisor Mary Alliston 'expressed concern to her superiors' that Beth was being 'worked to heath'.

The day after Beth's accident, the hospital held a meeting for the nurses and the Hospital's Director of Nursing, Kathy Smith, said she 'was so sorry about the death of Beth' and 'sorry that they had dropped the ball'.

Nurses who worked with Beth during her shift leading up to the accident said she complained about being 'really stressed' and said she 'hadn't eaten' at all during the shift.

Before joining the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit at The Jewish Hospital in 2000, Beth worked at another Mercy Health hospital but left for better hours.

'Nurse-to-patient ratio, it was just not at safe levels, so she went to Jewish,' Mr Jasper said.

The Jewish Hospital is owned by the Mercy Health company. Before going to Jewish, Beth worked at another Mercy hospital. She left that hospital because the nurse-to-patient ratio was 'not at safe levels' but Jewish was soon bought by the same company

But soon after, the hospital was bought by her old employer and staffing went down again.

The Ohio Nursing Association said these nursing shortages are becoming a real problem.

'Shortages mean nurses are routinely stretched too thin because they are expected to work longer shifts and care for a larger number of patients. This path often leads to nurse fatigue and is dangerous practice that compromises the safety of both the nurses and the patients they service,' Gingy Harshey-Meade of the ONA said.

In court last Thursday, Mr Jasper said that something needs to change about nurse staffing.

'They're passionate about their work. They don't want to make a mistake, but when you're working under those conditions, it's going to happen,' he said.
