Swimming stars Adam Peaty and Fran Halsall made it double Glasgow glory in the pool as they both added to England's gold medal haul tonight.

Fran Halsall claimed glory with victory in the 50 metres freestyle at the Tollcross Swimming Centre.

And on the same evening, 19-year-old Adam Peaty took the 100 metres breaststroke crown.

Halsall, 24, raced to victory in a Commonwealth Games record of 23.96 seconds to edge out Australia's Cate Campbell by 0.04 seconds.

It was England's third gold medal in the pool after the successes of Ben Proud and Chris Walker-Hebborn.

Halsall, who won silver in the event in Delhi, said she always believed such a time was in her.

'That was the target all year. I knew I was ready to swim it which made me more nervous,' she said.

England's Adam Peaty powered his way to winning gold in the Men's 100m breaststroke final beating South Africa's Cameron van der Burgh (behind Peaty) in to second

'It made me feel a little bit sick before I started because I wanted to get the results which I knew I could do and perform in a big final against some amazingly talented girls.

'In the last five metres I was thinking, 'No way am I winning this, I need to get my hand on the wall'. I am really happy and quite emotional.'

Halsall's team-mate Amy Smith came home eighth, with Scotland's Sian Harkin one place better off. 

Fearless Adam Peaty took on his idol, Olympic champion Cameron van der Burgh, and beat him to land the Commonwealth 100 metres breaststroke title.

He produced a storming last 25m, reeling the South African world-record holder Van der Burgh in the closing stages to touch in a Games record of 58.94 seconds, with home favourite Ross Murdoch taking the bronze.

The Uttoxeter swimmer trailed Van der Burgh by 0.70 seconds at the turn, but had timed his race to perfection as he stormed past the South African to win by 0.34 seconds, becoming the first Briton to go under 59 seconds in the process.

Peaty, who described the victory as a 'dream', said he had not been fazed by the prospect of taking on the might of Van der Burgh.

Asked if he was nervous about facing the man he described as his 'idol' turned 'rival', he said: 'Not really, he has obviously got a lot of pressure on him.

'I just tried to swim my race. I knew he would go out fast, as I have studied his racing quite a few times, but I stuck to my guns and it paid off in the end.

'We are all human at the end of the day, we all have nerves and feelings and that is the way you have to approach it.' 

There was more medal success for England's women as the quartet of Siobhan-Marie O'Connor, Amelia Maughan, Ellie Faulkner and Becki Turner took bronze in the 4x200m freestyle.

Wales' Georgia Davies claimed silver in the 100m backstroke, finishing in 59.58 as she was edged out by Australia's Emily Seebohm, while in the S14 200m freestyle 15-year-old Thomas Hamer took silver, with Wales' Jack Thomas getting the bronze.
