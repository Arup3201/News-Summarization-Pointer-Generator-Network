A father who had his ear bitten off in a random vicious attack now feels he can face the world again, after surgeons created an ultra-realistic prosthetic to replace it.

Thomas Tracey, 47, of Solihull, Birmingham, lost his entire left ear when a thug brutally assaulted him at a bonfire night in November 2009. He was with his children Demi, 16 and Daniel, 13 when the attack happened and had lost his wife to cancer just one month before.

'I had been at a bonfire with my two kids when this lunatic came out of nowhere, he must have been on drugs, and started on me.

'He bit my whole ear clean off. Paramedics managed to find it, but it was too badly damaged to sew back on.'

Spot the difference: Mr Tracey said he was shocked by how realistic his new prosthetic ear was

The double glazing salesman was fitted with a replacement crafted at the Maxillofacial Prosthetic Department in Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Edgbaston.

Mr Tracey said: 'I was shocked at how realistic the ear was. Once it’s on you can’t really tell the difference.'

Thomas said at the time of the attack he was more worried for his children than thinking about what had happened to him.

'I didn’t feel any of the pain,' he explained.

'I was more concerned about my children and keeping them away from this crazy man.'

The culprit has never been caught but the father of two has moved on.

'When
you’re treated at a hospital where soldiers are flown in without limbs 
you realise you’re lucky that you’re just missing a lobe,' he said.

'It puts things into perspective.'

He added that having a false ear did have its comic moments.

'I usually wear my fake ear when I’m going out,” he said.

'But the first time I wore it to go to a club, someone accidentally knocked it off - and it went flying into the middle of the dancefloor!

'I thought it was hilarious and picked it up and put it in my girlfriend’s handbag.'

A hospital spokeswoman said of the prosthetics department: 'The unit’s surgeons are seen performing some amazing work. It is the only such unit working with military patients and the only one to receive emergency trauma cases from all over Britain.'

Mr Tracey features in the second of four episodes in a series called Making Faces, which starts on Channel 5 tonight at 9pm
