Thousands of members of the public have chipped in to save the historic Wedgwood Collection for the nation.

The collection, which spans more than 250 years of the pottery firm's history, includes more than 80,000 works of art, ceramics and photographs as well as paintings by George Stubbs and Joshua Reynolds.

Its future had been in doubt since Waterford Wedgwood Potteries collapsed in 2009 with a £134million pension debt which threatened the future of the museum where it was kept, but a public appeal has raised the final £2.74million needed to safeguard the collection within a month of being launched.

Slave medallions, 1787: In the 1780s, Josiah Wedgwood, an anti-slavery activist, produced medallions advocating its abolition, made and distributed at his own expense. Bearing the motto ‘Am I not a man and a brother?’, they were tremendously popular

Black basalt rabbit, 1911: This astonishingly modern looking rabbit,with yellowglass eyes,shows just how Wedgwood moved with the times into the 20th Century, with designs showing more wit and becoming less ornate

That amount will be added to the £13million already raised with support from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Art Fund and a number of private trusts and foundations.

Art Fund director Stephen Deuchar said: 'This amazing show of public support for the Wedgwood Collection has made this the fastest fundraising campaign in the Art Fund's 111 year history.

'It demonstrates nothing less than a national passion for Wedgwood - its history, its quality, its brand, its continuity - bringing about a potent combination of donations big and small, ranging from £10 gifts via text to six-figure cheques.

Taurus the bull, 1957: Designed in the final Wedgwood glory days by Arnold Machin, the first full-time figure modeller to be employed at their Barlaston factory in Staffordshire. During the war, he had learned to manage without so many craftsmen, so made many works, such as this, out of only two pieces

Egyptian-style teapot with crocodile finial, 1800: Egypt was all the rage, thanks to Horatio Nelson’s victory in the Battle of the Nile in 1798. Wedgwood created a tea service using ancient hieroglyphics. The symbols were purely decorative, however, because their meaning wasn’t discovered until 1822

'Britain united to save this collection. Huge thanks to the Heritage Lottery Fund and their ticket buyers too. Together we've ensured that one of the most important collections in the world can continue to be enjoyed by all.'

More than 7,000 people donated to the public fundraising campaign with almost a third (30 per cent) coming from the Midlands where the company was traditionally based.

The collection will be given to the Victoria and Albert Museum but will remain on display in the museum at the Wedgwood factory site in Barlaston, near Stoke.

Dancing Hours, c. 1770: This is one of the best-known Wedgwood bas reliefs, designed in the familiar blue and white colours, and based on a chimney piece from the Palazzo Borghese in Rome. The frieze depicts the mythological Horae, Roman goddesses who personify the hours of the day

Anthony Jones, executive vice president of Wedgwood's parent company WWRD, said: 'Next year sees the launch of the World of Wedgwood, a new attraction that will allow visitors to explore the Wedgwood brand, its products and its history, as part of a unique and truly memorable experience.

'The collection is a key element of the Wedgwood story, bringing to life its rich heritage and craftsmanship. We are delighted its future is secure for the nation and are honoured to contribute to that future through being responsible for the operation of the Wedgwood Museum.

'Our focus now turns to ensuring the museum continues to deliver the high standards of collections care and public benefit for which it has been internationally recognised in recent years.'

The firm traces its history back to 1759 when Josiah Wedgwood started work as a potter in Staffordshire.

His work transformed the business from a cottage industry into an international success story and one of the world's most famous names in pottery.
