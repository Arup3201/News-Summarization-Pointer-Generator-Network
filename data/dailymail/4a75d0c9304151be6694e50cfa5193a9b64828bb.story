A brilliant Oxford University student has drowned in front of two despairing friends at a beauty spot in rural France, police revealed today.

Kojo Minta, 24, slipped into the fast-flowing Gave d'Oloron river in Navarrenx, in the Aquitaine region, close to the Pyrenees and the border with Spain.

He had just received a 'distinction' in his end-of-year exams at St Hilda's College, and was due to start a DPhil in history at Lincoln College.

But tragedy struck while Kojo was spending a summer's afternoon on an idyllic riverside popular with picnickers and bathers.

'Mr Minta was swept away beyond a small dam and eventually disappeared from two friends who were trying to save him,' said a local police spokesman.

'It appears that he had lost his footing, and was not a very strong swimmer. An English tourist in a separate group raised the alarm, with emergency service boats and a rescue helicopter arriving soon afterwards.

'The victim had been swept under the river by the time he was located. He had been in the water for around 20minutes by this time. More than an hour was spent by a doctor trying to resuscitate him, but to no avail.

'The man's friends were in a terrible state and had to be treated for psychological shock. It is normally a very safe, beautiful stretch of river. Many people swim there, especially on fine summer days.'

Kojo, a devout Christian who had moved from his home in America to study at Oxford, had been on vacation with friends in a cottage at Lay-Lamidou, a tiny hamlet nearby.

The accident - which is still being investigated by police - took place at around 5pm last Wednesday, August 10.

Kojo's name was released after his parents, Moses and Victoria Minta, back home in Houston, Texas, had been informed, together with his siblings, Anna and Kofi.

Kojo followed in a long line of talented Americans who have studied at Oxford. These include former President Bill Clinton, a former University College student, whom Kojo had met in the USA while completing his first degree at Pennsylvania University.

Kojo had just left St Hilda's, where he had been the vice-president of the postgraduate common room.

His academic results had been so impressive that he had already won funding to start his research at Lincoln in the autumn.

A student who knew Kojo well at St Hilda's said: 'Kojo was an absolutely brilliant student, who was loved and admired by everybody.

'He was gentle and kind - an inspiration to anyone who knew him. This is a devastating loss for Oxford University, and for everyone else who was fortunate enough to know Kojo.'

Anna Minta, Kojo's sister, has set up a memorial website in which she describes the keen saxophonist and former schoolboy footballer as being 'well known for his kindness, wit, style, and love of cooking, as well as his scholarly mind’.

Kojo had travelled to North Africa to study the effects of human trafficking on local communities, and had also helped open a library in Ghana.

Anna said that Kojo's last major academic work opened with quotes by Jeremy Taylor, the 17th Century Church of England writer and bishop.

They read: 'Death, which is the end of our life, is the enlargement of our spirits from hope to certainty, from uncertain fears to certain expectations, from the death of the body to the life of the soul.’

Kojo's body was due to be repatriated to America with the assistance of the US Embassy in Paris, and his funeral is due to take place at Braeswood Church in Houston on Saturday.
