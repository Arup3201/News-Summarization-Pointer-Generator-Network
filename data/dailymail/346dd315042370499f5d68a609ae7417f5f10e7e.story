Activist: Sylvia Pankhurst, pictured in 1932, was a prominent suffragette

The home of political activist and suffragette Sylvia Pankhurst has been transformed into a block of million-pound flats.

The women's rights campaigner, whose mother Emmeline and sister Christabel were also prominent votes-for-women campaigners, moved to Vine Cottage  in Woodford Green, Essex in the 1920s.

However, she quickly renamed the building Red Cottage in honour of her radical, left-wing politics.

But the now-unrecognisable area has been transformed into a block of 14 luxury apartments, which are expected to sell for between £500,000 and £1million each.

Miss Pankhurst lived in the home with her boyfriend Silvio Corio, an Italian anarchist who was fleeing the rise of fascism in Italy.

The pair - who scandalised local society by never marrying - sheltered their political allies during their nine-year stay at the address.

She was one of the most prominent and politically active members of the Women's Social and Political Union, nicknamed the suffragettes. Miss Pankhurst arrested at a protest in 1906 and jailed after she refused to pay a fine.

Along with many other women demanding the vote, she was sent to prison and force fed while on hunger strike - but lived to see women included in the voting franchise, which first happened in 1918.

She was living in Red Cottage when Parliament passed a 1928 Act giving all women in the United Kingdom the right to vote once they turned 21, which put them on equal footing with men.

All that remains from her time there is a sculpture which Mr Corio made in protest at Mussolini attacking Ethiopia.

Political movement: Miss Pankhurst, along with her mother Emmeline and sister Christabel, was part of the suffragette movement, which famously encouraged members to chain themselves to the railings of Buckingham Palace

Then: Red Cottage, pictured above in the 1920s, a haven for those who shared Pankhurst's politics

Now: Newly-constructed Highbeam House is made up of 14 two- and three-bedroom flats

The new development, Highbeam House, is made up of 14 apartments, which has two to three bedrooms each.

Property company Galliard Homes has restored the sculpture, which now stands outside Highbeam House as part of the new development.

David Galman, sales director at Galliard Homes, said: 'Sylvia Pankhurst was an important champion of women’s rights and civil rights in general.

'Her "Red Cottage" home was a haven for political refugees and a place where civil rights were promoted.

'When
 her home was demolished in 1939 her famous “tea shop” gardens were 
destroyed and the leafy and tranquil ambience of the site was lost.

Luxurious: The new interiors belie the socialist connections of the development

Pricey: The flats are expected to sell for between £500,000 and £1million each

Grounds: The homes back on to gardens which were once used by Miss Pankhurst to sell tea to raise money for the suffragettes

'With
 the creation of Highbeam House we have returned the site to its 
original roots - having just one property, rather than four - on the 
land.

'This
 has also enabled us to recreate a magnificent single rear garden, which
 are perfect for people who love gardens but don’t want the hassle of 
maintaining it themselves.

'Potential
 purchasers can visit the dressed show-apartment and landscaped gardens 
to experience the quality of the development and we hope that some 
visitors will appreciate the significant history of the site and the 
civil rights work of Sylvia Pankhurst'.

Red Cottage itself was pulled down in the 1930s, and four separate houses were later built on the land, before being demolished in turn and replaced with Highbeam House.

The political campaign to win women the vote began in the late 1800s, and picked up pace around the turn of the century.

The movement began peacefully, with the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies - also known as the suffragists - formed in 1897, led by by Millicent Fawcett. The group lobbied Parliament, and gained some support within the Establishment but overall met with limited success.

Protest: Suffragette Emily Davison was killed by the King's horse after running out in front of it in 1913

The issue became much more pressing in 1903 when Emmeline Pankhurt's suffragettes entered the political landscapes. The group was much more hardline, and would heckle politicians, attack the police and make very public protests - such as chaining themselves to the railings outside Buckingham Palace.

One of the most recognisable moments in the group's campaign came when Emily Davison ran out in from of the King's horse during the 1913 Derby. She was trampled by the animal and died.

The suffragettes suspended their campaigning when the First World War broke out in 1914. While men were away fighting, women manned the factories at home and, by the time the conflict ended, the public had become much more amenable to granting women votes.

At first, only certain women - over-30s, university graduates and property owners - could vote when the franchise was extended in 1918. But in 1928 the  Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act won them full suffrage.
