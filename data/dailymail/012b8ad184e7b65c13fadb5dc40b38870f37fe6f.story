With just over a month to go until Amir Khan steps under the flashing lights and into the ring at the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino, it looks like the 27-year-old is making the most of his training.

The Bolton-born welterweight, who is currently gearing-up in California has taken time out of the gym to snap this photo of himself, with his bulging pectoral muscles clear signs that his pre-fight bulking is going to plan.

Despite having to keep to a strenuous fitness programme, the British boxer has spent the past week indulging in some of the biggest sporting events in America whilst also meeting loved ones across the border in Canada.

Amir Khan is 'ready to use' his custom made red, white and blue sparring gloves

Khan splashed out on a private jet to fly himself from San Francisco to Vancouver, and couldn't resist taking a picture of himself in front of the aircraft.

Hours later, Khan posted again, this time in a restaurant with friends in the British Colombian City.

Despite dining in one of the best cities for cuisine in the world, the professional boxer is keeping to a strict diet in the lead-up to his second fight of the year.

Amir Khan will return to the ring in December for the first time since he beat Luis Collazo in Las Vegas in May

Khan said it was 'Good to see the boys in Vancouver' on arrival, after completing the short flight

On Saturday he posted a picture of a balanced meal of cooked meat and boiled vegetables on his proclaimed Instagram site.

Over the past week Khan also posted pictures from an Oakland Raiders NFL game, before watching game five of the World Series between the San Francisco Giants and the Kansas City Royals on Monday.

However, for the time being at least it looks like the 27-year-old's week of unadulterated fun has come to an end with Khan determined to reach the required load before his pre-match weigh in.

Although the hard work starts here, the welterweight boxer has used his credit card one more to purchase a vibrant pair of customised Grant sparring gloves.

Khan wrote: 'Ready to use my custom Grant sparring gloves'.

Adorned with the famous blue, red and white of the Union Jack, the gloves also have 'King Khan' printed on the top, a signature nickname which optimises the former Olympian’s confidence in the build-up to the glamorous brawl.

Khan will look to win his 30th professional fight when he meets Devon Alexander in Las Vegas on December 13.

Last week Khan posted a picture with the Oakland Raiders' Menelik Watson before and NFL game
