A couple who both carry the cystic fibrosis gene have beaten odds to have a fit and healthy baby boy - after nine years of trying to have a child.

Chris Kiernan, who has cystic fibrosis, and wife Marylee, who carries the gene, had almost given up hope of ever becoming parents.

Married in 2004, they starting trying for a baby the following year but with no joy.

Chris and Marylee Kiernan tried unsuccessfully for nine years to have a baby before they conceived Alexander. Mr Keirnan has cystic fibrosis and his wife is a carrier of the genetic condition

Baby Alexander was conceived using fertility treatment. This allowed doctors to ensure he wouldn't have cystic fibrosis. He was born completely healthy last Saturday

According to the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, although men who have cystic fibrosis can enjoy a normal sex life, about 98 per cent are infertile.

This is because the vas deferens, the tube that carries sperm from the testis to the penis, does not develop properly.

After numerous failed attempts and a miscarriage in 2009, the disheartened couple, both aged 32, considered IVF treatment.

It was only as they were looking into the options that Mrs Kiernan discovered she was a cystic fibrosis carrier.

The couple, from Camelon, Falkirk, then had to consider a complex set of options to ensure that if they had a baby, it would be protected from the genetic condition that causes mucus to build up in the lungs and digestive system.

Instead of ordinary IVF, they had to travel to London to have pre-implantation genetic diagnosis - a procedure that provides a slimmer chance of getting pregnant than IVF but that allows the baby to be screened for genetic illnesses.

Mr and Mrs Kiernan (pictured at their wedding in 2004) say they are overjoyed and relieved that Alexander has now been born safely

And after more negative results, they had given up all hope.

But last Saturday little baby Alexander arrived five weeks early but fighting fit.

Mrs Kiernan said: ‘It’s amazing he’s here. I keep looking at him and can’t believe he’s mine.’

About one in every 2,500 babies in the UK have cystic fibrosis.

To be born with the condition both of a child's parents have to carry the gene or have the condition.

If this is the case, their child will have a one in four chance of having cystic fibrosis, a one in four chance of not having the gene at all and a 50 per cent chance of being a carrier but not having the condition.

Mr Kiernan, an HGV mechanic, said: ‘We were told there was a very high risk of the baby having cystic fibrosis and being very ill.

‘So instead of ordinary IVF, we had to have pre-implantation genetic diagnosis where the chances of getting pregnant are slimmer than normal IVF.’

Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis scans the cells of embryos, checking the genes for genetic conditions or disorders.

The couple travelled from their home in Scotland to London’s Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital in 2007 as this is the only place in the UK where the treatment was available.

Mrs Kiernan said: ‘A week before Christmas in 2012, we got negative results again, and I thought, “that’s it, I’m not going through it again”.

‘I was in a lot of pain and had had two operations along the way.

‘By now, Edinburgh Royal was offering the tests, and a nurse begged me to try again.’

After paying £5,000 for a last try, the couple found out in June 2013 that Mrs Kiernan was pregnant.

Mrs Kiernan said: 'It's amazing he's here. I keep looking at him and can't believe he's mine'

Mr and Mrs Kiernan almost gave up after their first attempt at fertility treatment failed

Mrs Kiernan said: ‘We’re so happy. It was such a big relief.’

Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that causes the lungs and digestive system to become clogged with thick, sticky mucus.

This causes a cough, recurrent chest infections, and poor weight gain in children.

The condition affects about one in every 2,500 babies born in the UK and reduces life expectancy significantly.
