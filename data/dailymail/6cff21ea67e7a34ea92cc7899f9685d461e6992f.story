Struggling hospitals are ‘in denial’ about their failure to provide safe care to patients, a leading health watchdog has warned.

Professor Sir Mike Richards, the chief inspector of hospitals, said some NHS trusts had failed to learn from more successful ones for what ‘sometimes seems like decades’.

Although there were many examples of outstanding NHS care in challenging circumstances, a few hospitals still deny they had problems and resist efforts to help them improve, he claimed.

And he said the public’s loyalty to the NHS should not blind them to the fact that it does not always do ‘quite as good a job as we would like it to do’.

He told The Independent: ‘Some of the struggling trusts [we have inspected] have responded incredibly well but others less so.

'Some have said we can get on with it on our own. But there are those that are somewhat in denial about their current position. That’s not a healthy state to be in.’

Sir Mike was appointed as chief inspector with the Care Quality Commission watchdog after the Mid-Staffordshire scandal.

As many as 1,200 patients may have died while being treated by the NHS trust because of poor care.
