He's made an inspirational move from his street upbringing to become a bona fide pop star, so it was only a matter of time before Dizzee Rascal was hired as a talent show judge.

The East London born chart-topper, 24, will be putting his musical knowledge to perfect use when he joins Sharleen Spiteri and Jamie Cullum on the judging panel for Sky1's Must Be The Music.

The lyricist will be helping to find the UK's best new musical act, with hopefuls from every genre encouraged to audition for a chance to win the £100,000 cash prize.

Singing for England: James Corden and Dizzee Rascal give it their all as they film the video to England's unofficial World Cup song

Mills said: 'I know how hard it is to break into the music industry and am giving all you fellow musicians out there a chance to come and show me, the other judges and the rest of the UK that we really do have some of the best musicians in the world right under our noses, who deserve a break. I'm here to give you that break.'

Dizzee, real name Dylan Mills, has had a meteoric rise to fame since his debut album Boy In Da Corner won the Mercury Music Prize in 2003.

Just last weekend his latest release Dirtee Disco hit the number one spot in the UK singles charts, giving him his fourth number one single.

Hoping for success: Proceeds from the duo's single will be donated to Great Ormond Street hospital

The music maker started making music at school, graduating to priate radio where he performed with his former crew Roll Deep - which included ex-friend and fellow chart-topper, Wiley.

The two worked together on his debut LP, which was released seven years ago to critical acclaim.

Success soon followed, with hits including Dance Wiv Me, Sirens, Bonkers and latest number one Dirtee Disco, which features X Factor singer Daniel Pierce.

So it must be said that, with his tough background, which saw him
expelled from four different schools, and subsequent climb into the
music industry Dizzee is more than qualified to dole out advice to the
show's hopefuls.

Meanwhile, Dizzee could be set for another big hit after recording a World Cup track with comedian James Corden.

Hoping for victory: Dizee will no doubt be hoping for another number one with the new single

The duo have recorded an unofficial England anthem (a cover of Tears for Fears song Shout), which they recorded on last Saturday's Britain's Got Talent final, and stills from the video have been released in anticipation of the new single.

In the video, recorded at Rugby Union side Harlequins' London ground, Dizzee and James wear red England tops emblazoned with their names on the back.

They are seen singing along in the crowd for the track, which has been masterminded by X Factor mogul Simon Cowell, 50.

Tears for Fears singer Curt Smith also helped to rework his 1985 hit, with all royalties going to Great Ormond Street Hospital.

Other stars, including Freddie Flintoff, Denise Van Outen and Vernon Kay, have also lent their support.

It has been said that Dizzee's section on the track could well eclipse John Barnes' famous rap from the New Order 1990 anthem World In Motion.

The single is available for download from tomorrow.
