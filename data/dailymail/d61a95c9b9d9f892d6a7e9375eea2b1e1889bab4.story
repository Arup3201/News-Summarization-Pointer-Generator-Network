The BBC has been accused of a cover-up after spending almost £350,000 on a legal battle to suppress an internal report about bias in its Middle East coverage.

A seven-year campaign to gain access to the 2004 document, which examined the corporation’s coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, ended in defeat  yesterday after the Supreme Court ruled it could remain secret.

Lawyer Steven Sugar, who passed away last year, made a Freedom of Information request in 2005 for disclosure of the 20,000-word Balen Report.

But the corporation argued it was exempt from revealing information it held for the purposes of ‘journalism, art or literature’.

After years of courtroom battles and Mr Sugar’s death, his widow Fiona  Paveley continued on his behalf.

Her lawyer, Michael Levey, said  the 
family were ‘considering their options’ after the Supreme Court  
dismissed the latest appeal after ruling the report was ‘outside the 
scope’ of the FoI Act.

By September 2010, the BBC had spent 
£270,000 on the case, but senior insiders admitted this had now 
increased to as much as £350,000.

Probe: BBC veteran Jeremy Bowen who is the Middle East Editor

The broadcaster’s reluctance to reveal
the details of the dossier – which was compiled by Malcolm Balen, a 
senior journalist and editorial adviser at the BBC – has led to 
speculation that it  was highly critical.

Lord Janner of Braunstone, chairman of the Britain Israel Parliamentary Group, said last night: ‘What have they got to hide?’

Tory MP Mike Freer, vice-chairman of 
the All Party Parliamentary Group Against Anti-Semitism, added: ‘This is
the worst of all outcomes.

‘It fuels suspicion they have got  something to hide.’

A spokesman for the BBC insisted it 
did not have anything to hide about its Middle East coverage but had 
pursued the case to defend its right to protect information about its 
journalism.

He added: ‘We welcome the Supreme 
Court’s judgment, which will ensure that the BBC is afforded the space 
to conduct its journalistic activities freely.

‘Independent journalism requires  
honest and open internal debate free from external pressures. This 
ruling enables us to continue to do that.’

Revelation: Barbara Plett said she cried when Yasser Arafat was close to death in 2004

The BBC has faced claims that its reporting of the Arab-Israeli conflict has been skewed towards the Palestinian cause.

Critics cite the revelation from Middle East correspondent Barbara Plett
(pictured) that she cried when Yasser Arafat was close to death in 2004.

And a confidential report put together by the Corporation lifts the lid on whether they really had a pro-Palestinian bias.

However, the 20,000-word document compiled by veteran journalist Malcolm Balen will now be kept secret after the Supreme Court ruling.

Lawyer Steven Sugar requested to see the 2004 document under freedom of information laws.

It examines hundreds of hours of BBC radio and television broadcasts.

However, the BBC turned down the request and - after seven years - the highest court in the land has finally ruled that it will remain secret.

The decision will disappoint the Jewish community which would have wanted 
to know whether the document had found any evidence of 
anti-Israeli bias in news programming.

The BBC said that, under the Freedom of Information Act, it is exempt 
from disclosing information held for the purposes of 'journalism, art or
literature'.

However, Mr Sugar, who represented himself in court, said the Balen Report should be published as part of a debate about alleged anti-Israeli bias.

His widow Fiona Paveley took the case to the Supreme Court after he died from cancer in January last year.
