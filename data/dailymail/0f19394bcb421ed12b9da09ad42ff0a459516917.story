Angry: Lyndsey Glassett claims her sister, who lives in the flat above her, deliberately sabotaged her Jerusalem artichokes ‘out of spite’

When Lyndsey Glassett returned home from a weekend away she was devastated to find that her beloved Jerusalem artichoke plants were all dying.

The 67-year-old liked to grow them to cook with, stewing them for hours in wine or grating them into salads.

But in the space of just a weekend their leaves had turned black and withered and they were on the brink of death.

When she reviewed her CCTV footage, she discovered the culprit appeared to be the woman who lived in the flat upstairs.

This was no ordinary neighbourly dispute, however – for that woman was her younger sister, Gillian Leeden.

The incident has now led to a legal battle between the two sisters.

Mrs Glassett believes her sister deliberately targeted the plants she had spent two years growing in their mother’s garden.

But her sister’s defence is that she mistook the plants for weeds and she was clearing them away. The 62-year-old registered nurse is now facing criminal charges after she was allegedly captured spraying ‘weed killer’ over the vegetables.

Mrs Glassett claims that her sister killed the Jerusalem artichokes ‘out of spite’, as ‘part of an ongoing harassment’ towards her.

The pair had been at loggerheads for years but things came to a head after Mrs Glassett returned to their home town of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, in 2009 after living in France for five years.

Twice-divorced Mrs Glassett moved into her mother’s maisonette, which is below Mrs Leeden’s flat, and turned her garden into an allotment, planting beans, peas, lettuce, radish, tomatoes and her prized Jerusalem artichokes. 

Mrs Glassett said: ‘They are not widely available to purchase in shops in England. I had grown them in France and both my mother and I enjoyed eating them. I used them for soup, I grated them raw into salads, and tossed in butter after steaming in wine and herbs.

Accused: Gillian Leeden, 62, is facing a charge of criminal damage but insists she sprayed the artichokes with weedkiller thinking they were weeds. The plants were growing in the bed pictured

‘There were far too many artichokes for our sole use and I gave many of them to friends and neighbours.

‘I believe Gillian Leeden killed my artichokes deliberately. I was due to move out less than a month from when she did this so I don’t know why she could not have waited for me to remove my plants.’

She claims their relationship hit rock bottom when she moved in with their mother Jean, who passed away weeks before the artichoke incident.

Mrs Glassett, a retired chiropodist, said in a witness statement: ‘There is a lot of history behind why I no longer speak with Gillian but we have not spoken since December 2010. We do not see eye to eye.’

Prized: Mrs Glassett takes great care of her Jerusalem artichokes and likes to use them for cooking

Mrs Leeden, a twice-divorced mother of two, will now stand trial after pleading not guilty to criminal damage at Stevenage Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday.

Rufia Khatum, prosecuting, said that Mrs Leeden claims she could not have intended to damage the artichokes because she thought they were weeds.

She said: ‘The issue for the trial is one of lawful excuse, the defendant denies mens rea [guilty intent] and [claims] the items did not belong to the alleged party.’

Court clerk Denise Coster added: ‘She does not accept that she damaged the artichoke plants... She didn’t think they were a cultivated plant, simply that they were weeds.’
