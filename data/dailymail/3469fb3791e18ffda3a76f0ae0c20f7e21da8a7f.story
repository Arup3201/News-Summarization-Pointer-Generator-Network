A former chapel featured in one of LS Lowry’s renowned street scenes is to reopen as a mosque.

The plan to use the Mount Zion Methodist Church in Clitheroe, Lancashire, as a Muslim place of worship initially sparked fierce opposition.

The chapel can be seen in the 1954 painting A Street in Clitheroe, one of several paintings that Lowry, famous for his matchstick men, made of the town.

It had by then been closed for worship 
for 14 years, finding roles as a munitions store, metal box works and 
garment-making factory.

Now the local Muslim community is close to being able to worship in what will be the market town’s first mosque.

Plans lodged by Clitheroe’s 300 Muslims in 2006 to convert it into a 
mosque sparked hundreds of objections, many of them branded racist, and 
the issue was picked up by the British National Party.

Seven years on, the first phase of conversion is complete, and the 
community is now trying to raise £250,000 to install heating and 
lighting, internal decoration, doors and windows.

Farouk Hussain, chairman of Medina Islamic Education Centre, said the work was now drawing support from all sides.

‘It’s been a long time coming, so there is a positive reaction from 
Muslims in the town,’ he said. 

'Wonderful': Muslim leaders in Clitheroe say that, despite initial opposition, the project has now received positive reactions from all sectors of the community

‘However, the support from across the 
town is really wonderful. We’ve been getting positive reactions from 
interfaith groups and people of no religion too are getting behind the 
project.’

He added that reopening the chapel to worshippers – albeit of a 
different religion – was in keeping with its significance to the town.

‘We value the building and its history and it will remain the same as 
when Lowry painted it as part of his Clitheroe street scene.’

Clitheroe councillor Jim Shervey said: ‘People of all faiths have the 
right to have somewhere to worship. There were some concerns a few years
ago, but my understanding is they have all been dealt with.

‘It’s a good use of the building, and obviously it is better to be  used for a purpose than left  standing empty.’
