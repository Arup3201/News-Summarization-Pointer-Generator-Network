A rookie police officer is dead and another eight cops injured after an NYPD van crashed early Sunday in the Bronx.

The one-car crash happened about 5am as the van carrying the nine cops crashed underneath the Bruckner Expressway, at Bruckner Boulevard near Bryant Avenue, in the Hunts Point neighborhood, CBS New York reported.

Officer Michael Williams, 25 — who had jointed the force in January — was ejected through the back of the van during the crash, the New York Daily News reported. He was transported to Lincoln Medical Center but died of his injuries.

'That’s all he ever wanted to do was become a police officer,' said Philip Banks III, NYPD's chief of department, according to the Daily News.

'It was a dream come true that he was able to serve in the Police Department,' he added of Williams, whose dad was a longtime officer in Carmel, upstate New York.

'We are going to miss Michael.'

Williams' casket was draped in an American flag and loaded into an NYPD vehicle about noon — as more than 75 officers saluted silently, according to the Daily News.

The cause of the crash remains under investigation. The eight injured officers are expected to survive

'Thank you for showing respect for a fallen comrade,' one inspector told the cops, the Daily News reported.

The
 other eight injured officers were taken to several hospitals in the 
Bronx and were expected to survive, the station reported. One had cuts to his head and injured his right shoulder, according to CBS New York.

'We are hoping and expecting a full recovery,' Banks said, according to the station.

The nine 
officers were riding from the 47th Precinct in the Bronx to staff the 
United Nations and the People's the United Nations Climate March in 
Manhattan, according to NBC New York.

The cause of the crash remains unclear, but Banks said early-morning showers may have contributed.

'Our
 hearts are heavy this morning after a tragic police van accident,' Banks tweeted Sunday morning. 'We pray 
for the [officer] we lost, and for a quick recovery of those injured.'

Eyewitness William Soto described the scene to CBS New York.

'They put the neck brace on his neck,' Soto told the station. 'They had another officer sitting on the ground and, I guess, for precuation, they put him in the ambulance afterward.

'Then they had another officer standing,' he added. 'I guess, also for precaution, they had him on the board and also took him to the hospital.

'Then a passerby told me: "Oh, there was another cop laying in the middle of the highway on the Bruckner."

'He was all mangled up — so he might have been ejected out of the side doors somehow.'

Neighbors said the Bruckner Expressway gets dangerously slick when it rains, as it did overnight.

Investigators were still at the scene halfway through Sunday morning.
