A possible successor to disgraced San Diego mayor Bob Filner, 70, who resigned on Friday after weeks of allegations of sexual harassment, has also been accused of inappropriate sexual behavior.

According to investigative website Voice of OC, Republican ex-councilman Carl DeMaio, 38, has been caught on multiple occasions leaving meetings and masturbating in restrooms at work.

DeMaio's spokesman Dave McCulloch has categorically denied that any such behavior took place and accused his political opponents of dirty tactics.

'It is absurd and ludicrous. It is absolutely ludicrous to report on something like this in the first place,' McCulloch told the site on Thursday.

Allegations: Republican Carl DeMaio, 38, has been accused of leaving meetings and masturbating in restrooms at work caught on multiple occasions. The ex-councilman is thought to be considering a run for San Diego mayor

Disgraced: Bob Filner resigned as San Diego mayor on Friday after weeks of pressure and allegations of sexual harassment from nearly 20 women

The Voice of OC reported that in 2009 Democrat Ben Hueso, San Diego council president at the time, twice walked in on DeMaio masturbating.

He claims that he walked in on his colleague engaging in the inappropriate act in front of a urinal with his pants round his ankles.

Hueso, 52, said: 'DeMaio was masturbating. He 
jumped, caught by surprise. He jumped to the sink … saying 'I'm sorry, 
I'm sorry' about six times. Then washed his hands, darted out.'

Councilwoman Marti Emerald confirmed this version of events, claiming she saw Hueso outside the restroom just after the incident.

'Ben
was in a state of shock, face red, eyes bulging,' Emerald explained . 'I said: ‘You look like you just saw the devil?' He said: 
‘DeMaio is masturbating in the middle of the room.'

Emerald told the Voice of OC that 'everyone' at the council knew of the rumors. Others suggest that tales of DeMaio's alleged behavior became a joke at San Diego City Hall.

Shock? Democrat Ben Hueso, San Diego council president at the time, claims he twice walked in on DeMaio masturbating

The openly gay DeMaio is currently running
for Congress but thought to be once again considering challenging for mayor.
DeMaio lost the mayor's election to Filner in November 2012.

There were some attempts by journalists to report the story but nothing was published.

Hueso, now a state senator, claims he didn't want to file a complaint against the powerful DeMaio, while Emerald had not personally witnessed anything that could be reported.

Spokesmen for DeMaio have strongly denied the allegations. 'There is no other way to respond to this than to call it what it is: a lie,' Jason Roe told The Daily Caller.

'If
Ben Hueso started this rumor,' spokesman Roe continued, 'he embarrasses himself and 
our great city. This is exactly the kind of gutter politics that has 
lead to the dysfunction of our political system in San Diego and 
Washington, D.C.'

Roe added: 'Ben Hueso and his union allies ignored Bob Filner's 
serial sexual harassment to keep Carl from winning the mayor's race and 
now he's manufacturing a lie to stop Carl's momentum.'

DeMaio's spokesman McCulloch told Voice of OC there had been a large campaign waged against him in last November's mayoral election, where DeMaio was beaten by Filner.

'A
whole lot of money was spent to paint Carl in a bad light,' said 
McCulloch. 'If this allegation was at all serious, or actually true, 
this would have been exposed.'

The Daily Caller reported on Friday that a spokeswoman for Hueso did not dispute the accuracy of his words in the Voice of OC article.

Challenge: DeMaio (picture) who lost the mayoral election to Bob Filner in November 2012 may now take another attempt at the job

Filner resigned as mayor on Friday after weeks of pressure and allegations of sexual harassment from nearly 20 women.

DeMaio is reportedly considering challenging again for the now vacant post. As reported by CBS, he has discussed a mayoral campaign with supporters and community leaders who want him to run.

'We're all focused on healing, coming together as a city and getting back to basic city business,' he added.
