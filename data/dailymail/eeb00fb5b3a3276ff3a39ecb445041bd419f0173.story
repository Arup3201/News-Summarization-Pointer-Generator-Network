The A&E four-hour waiting target will be missed for the whole of 2014/15, the Department of Health today said.

Repeated failure to achieve the target of 95 per cent of patients waiting four hours or less at A&E departments in England means it is no longer possible for the NHS to meet the standard for the year.

The latest figures, for the week ending March 8, show the gold standard was missed for the 23rd week running.

It comes as a report warns even top performing hospitals are showing signs of buckling under the immense pressures faced by the NHS.  

'Warning signs are flashing' across hospitals with experts advising the Government there is 'no quick fix' to the troubles plaguing the health service. 

The Department of Health today said the four-hour A&E waiting time will be missed for the whole of 2014/15 after the latest weekly figures showed the target was not achieved for the 23rd consecutive week 

Today NHS England revealed 92 per cent of patients spent four hours or less from arrival to being sent home or admitted elsewhere in the hospital.

It marks a four-week high, but still falls short of the 95 per cent target.

It came in spite of higher numbers of patients attending emergency departments, with 434,800 patients visiting A&E - up by more than 8,000 from the previous week and a four-week high.

A round-up of the winter's figures show unprecedented demand on A&E, with two weeks in December having the two highest attendance figures ever recorded for a winter period. 

Emergency departments across England dealt with more than seven million attendances from November to February - an increase of 190,000 on the same period last winter.

And demand in November and December was particularly high, with attendances up by 6.2 per cent over the two months. 

The highest peak was seen before Christmas in the week ending December 21, when there were 446,000 attendances - up 9.3 per cent on the same week last winter.   

A Department of Health spokeswoman said: 'We know the NHS is busier than ever before and despite missing the A&E standard for the year, over nine out of ten patients are being seen, treated and discharged within four hours.

'We've given a record £700 million this winter for almost 800 more doctors, 4,700 more nurses and 6,400 more beds and are backing the NHS long term plan which focuses on joining up care and doing more to prevent illness, and have provided an extra £2 billion in funding next year to build a service fit for the future.'

Meanwhile a new report by the Nuffield Trust suggests the problems facing the NHS go far deeper into hospitals than just the front door at A&E.

They warn a 'deteriorating access to services is starting to affect patients attending even the best-performing hospitals'.

Meanwhile those at the bottom end of the performance pile have seen a 'marked deterioration'. 

The think tank has warned that not only are patients waiting longer to be seen in A&E, access to key services across the hospital is being affected by 'systemic' declines in performance.  

Patients arriving at A&E have often had to wait longer than the four-hour target, according to the Nuffield Trust's analysis of how all 156 hospitals trusts in England have performed against six national targets over the course of the Coalition government.

It comes as a report warns even top performing hospitals are showing signs of buckling under the immense pressures faced by the NHS. It found the problems facing the NHS go far deeper into hospitals than just the front door at A&E, affecting access to planned treatments

But the report highlights the problems with today's NHS go further than A&E.

It found the majority of hospitals breached a target on at least one of the six measures - most notably the A&E waiting time, the 18-week target for a hospital bed, and the six-week target for scans and other diagnostic tests. 

Co-author Holly Dorning, said: 'The vast majority of patients are still receiving care within the target times, but our analysis shows that deteriorating access to services is starting to affect patients attending even the best-performing hospitals.

'We've known that hospitals have been struggling to meet the four-hour A&E target for a while.

'But the fact that we are starting to see problems in other areas, like access to planned treatment, is a real concern. 

95 per cent – the national target specifying the proportion of patients that should spend four hours or less in A&E before being sent home or admitted elsewhere in the hospital.

92 per cent – average performance against the four-hour target by major A&E departments in 2014.

Three hours 43 minutes – the average time spent in A&E by a patient who is admitted to hospital after leaving A&E.

Two hours 17 minutes – the average time spent in A&E by a patient who is sent home after leaving A&E.

More than one hour, four minutes – how much longer on average a patient over the age of 75 spends in A&E compared with those aged under 75.

'As this study makes clear, warning lights are now starting to flash across the wider hospital system.'

The Nuffield Trust's analysis also questions the assumption that access to care deteriorates as hospitals are asked to treat more patients.

While extra activity in A&E, outpatient treatments and cancer care is matched with poorer performance against access targets, the NHS has absorbed an additional 240,000 diagnostic tests and an additional 45,000 urgent cancer referrals in the past year with little impact on performance against the associated targets.

Criteria monitored by the trust also included the 18-week target for an outpatient appointment, the two-week target for urgent cancer referral, and the 31-day target for cancer treatment.

Co-author Ian Blunt warned there is no 'quick fix' to the problems.

He said: 'While looking at a narrow set of targets can only tell us so much about the quality of care, this analysis does suggest that some of the recent reductions in performance are systemic.

'The response to declining performance must be dictated by a deeper understanding of its causes, and political leaders should be aware of their system-wide nature.

'There are no quick fixes for growing waiting times and we need to be prepared to see further breaches of targets in the future.'

The report states that longer waiting times could simply be the result of hospitals having to carry out more procedures. 

Nuffield Trust analysis shows that increases in hospital activity are not always associated with a decrease in waiting time performance.

The report adds: 'Failure to meet, for example, the four-hour A&E target appears to have very little bearing on performance against other measures. 

'This again suggests that these problems may be systemic and that applying extra pressure at hospital level is not the best approach to reversing the recent performance drop.' 

A Department of Health spokeswoman said: 'We know the NHS is busier than ever  and despite missing the A&E target for the year, over nine out of 10 patients are being seen, treated and discharged within four hours.

A Department of Health spokesman said: 'The NHS is busier than ever, as innovative treatments and medicines mean people are living longer with complex conditions like heart disease or diabetes.

'We've increased the NHS budget by £16 billion over this Parliament but ultimately we want to reduce pressure on services through our plans to increase access to primary care and look after people better in the community.' 

Responding to the latest A&E figures, Sarah Pinto-Duschinsky, director of operations and delivery for NHS England, said: 'This winter NHS staff in England pulled out all the stops and, compared with last year, provided care for an incredible 190,000 more people coming to A&E and 51,000 more being admitted to hospital as an emergency.

'These record numbers - up by between six and nine per cent some weeks - mean that although the NHS won't have met the A&E average 95 per cent target for the full year, staff continued even during this busiest winter ever to treat more than nine in ten people within four hours.

'And most patients were, in fact, treated in under an hour. This is not only the best performance in the UK but probably of any major country internationally.

'These winter pressures underline the importance of the wider work under way as part of the NHS Urgent and Emergency Care Review which will deliver care in a more integrated way, better helping people get the right treatment, at the right time and in the right place.'
