Aaron Giacopazzi was jailed for 16 years for masterminding a major drugs racket

A crime lord mocked by a judge who told him he had lost his 'street cred' following a petty fuel theft has been hauled back into court and jailed for 16 years for masterminding a major drugs racket.

Gang boss Aaron Giacopazzi, 47, had been nicknamed 'The Godfather' for building a crime empire in his hometown of Carlisle, Cumbria.

In his most recent ploy the criminal was identified as being a link 
man between a north east-based drugs gang and another criminal group in 
Lancashire, following a major
police surveillance operation named 
'Operation Chamonix' last February .

Officers watched the gang carry out 
major drug deals at Cumberland Hospital car park in Carlisle and at a 
McDonald's restaurant in Carlisle city centre.

Giacopazzi was caught on film meeting accomplices in an Audi at Morrisons 
supermarket car park in Blackburn town centre to arrange a £43,000 exchange for 4.4lbs of cocaine.

Christopher Brookes, 53, Ayab 
Khansai, 54, and Shabaz Choudrey, 34, were part of the Lancashire gang there to buy cocaine.

North east contact Curtis Waite,
24 was also seen at the in an Astra van. Police swooped just as the drugs deal was about to be completed.

Police found £560,000 of the drug in the 
rear of a Vauxhall Astra van and £43,000 in cash stuffed in a shoebox in
the back of an Audi.

Officers said the gang were 'drugs 
wholesalers' responsible for flooding towns with Class A drugs. 
Giacopazzi admitted conspiracy to supply drugs and perverting the course
of justice.

On Friday at Carlisle Crown Court, 
Giacopazzi was brought back before Judge Paul Batty who told him: 'You were 
the godfather of this operation, the essential broker who brought the 
two sides together.

'You were the central figure, closely 
involved in organising the buying and selling on a commercial scale. You
have chosen to pursue a life of crime as a dealer in drugs.

'The high level of purity, particularly of the cocaine, indicates the closeness of your contacts to the source of supply.'

Giacopazzi was branded one of 
Carlisle's most notorious criminals by police and was said to be 
'someone who wields considerable influence over others.'

Accomplices Choudrey, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, and Khansia, 54, of Blackburn, Lancashire, were each jailed for 10 years.

Brookes, 53, of Blackburn 
was sentenced to nine years, Waite, 24, of 
Billingham, Cleveland was jailed for six years, while Giacopazzi was handed a 16-year sentence.

Acting Det Supt Paul Duhig of Cumbria 
Police said: 'The sentences passed in court speak for themselves. Our 
highly committed and effective officers and staff continue to focus on 
the criminals posing the biggest threat to the communities of Cumbria.

'Anyone who thinks that getting 
involved in drug supply or serious crime can pay, should think again. 
This case is the latest in a long line of successful investigations 
which send a clear message to organised criminals in Cumbria - you will 
end up in court and waste a large part of your life in prison.'

Joanne Cunliffe, Crown Advocate from 
the CPS North West Complex Case Unit, said: 'These criminals were 
responsible for the large scale supply of drugs throughout Cumbria and 
the North of England.

'By securing their conviction, the CPS
and police have dismantled this supply chain and removed a prominent 
source of drugs from the region.'

Two years ago Giacopazzi was jokingly branded a 'silly fuel' by locals after the same judge ridiculed him after he took part in a bungled attempt to steal diesel from a farm with his brother.

Judge Batty said given Giacopazzi had a 
long record for serious crimes like armed robbery, drug dealing and 
firearms offences, he would have been 'embarrassed' at being arrested 
over the foiled theft.

He was given a 12-month 
suspended prison term and placed under a curfew by Judge Batty who told
him: 'With your record you were probably embarrassed at being arrested 
for this. Your street credibility is significantly reduced now.'

His previous jail sentences include nine years for a bungled raid on a Securicor depot in 1991, five years for heroin dealing in 1997 and four years for firearms offences in 2000.

In 2004 Judge Batty jailed him for ten years for supplying 33,000 worth of heroin and told him: 'You are a professional career criminal who started off as an armed robber, but because armed robbery has risks, you moved to drug dealing where the risks are far less for those at the top and the profits are greater.

'You are someone who wields considerable influence over others.'
