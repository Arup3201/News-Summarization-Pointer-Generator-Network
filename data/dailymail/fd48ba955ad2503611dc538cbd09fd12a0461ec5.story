Three elementary teachers in a New Jersey school district have been caught having a shocking conversation about some of their special needs students, referring to them as 'morons' and 'short bus kids' - and are now set to be fired as a result.

The teachers - Tyler Van Pelt, Maria Weber and Maryellen Lechelt - allegedly engaged in an inappropriate online discussion on October 23 while training in a new technology to be implemented in their school district of Edison, however were unaware that the chat room could be accessed by others in the program.

Another teacher in the room suspected the trio were making fun of her after hearing them laughing and soon stumbled upon a transcript of their vulgar chat, which she then sent to her principal.

The three were suspended with pay - as per procedure - and are accused of unbecoming conduct, insubordination for misuse of school technology, failure to pay attention to the training and violating the district's sexual harassment and affirmative action policies, among other charges, NBC New York reported.

The teachers were learning how to use Chromebook laptops when the incident occurred.

According to NJ.com, Van Pelt invited Weber and Lechelt into what he called a 'personal wiseass (sic) backchannel discussion'.

'i like the group name ''morons'',' Lechelt allegedly responded.

'they take the tart cart home.'

Van Pelt then wrote back: 'short bus kids.'

Van Pelt also described a group of his students as 'I hate you don't waste my time'. 

Lechelt, following suit, described some of her own charges as 'jesus christ, why the f--- did they place you with me?'.

Weber did not contribute to that conversation, however the chat moved from students to fellow teachers.

Weber is accused of speaking out of line by questioning the sexual hygiene habits of the woman running the training program.

'She looks like a poor man's Denise Richards,' Van Pelt allegedly wrote of the woman.

'poor man's anything is as good as its gonna get in edison,' Lechelt wrote back.

Van Pelt allegedly then said of the woman: 'i'd like to invite her to a private backchannel discussion... all night long.'

During the conversation, Van Pelt suggested he was leaving the room to masturbate, NJ.com reported.

He was subsequently accused of Masturbating In or Around Board Property, but denies this happened. 

Van Pelt and Lechelt are teachers at Lincoln Elementary.

Van Pelt runs a local education blog, while Lechelt won the 2012 Outstanding Classroom Teacher of the Year award from the Edison Chamber of Commerce.

Weber is a teacher at James Monroe Elementary.

The Edison Board of Education met on Monday to discuss the matter.

They moved to terminate the teachers, but have put them on paid leave for 120 days in the interim.

Their case will be decided by an arbitrator, who may also decide to keep them on or reduce their pay.

Parents of the students who attend classes by the teachers involved are said to be furious.

'If you choose to be a teacher, it's a public work. You're dealing with kids. If you don't have it in you, I feel like the decent thing for you to do is to resign,' parent Andrea Siragusa told NBC New York.
