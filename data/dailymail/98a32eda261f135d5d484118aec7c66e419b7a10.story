She is the world's most famous supermodel, admired across the world for her beauty.

He is the future King of England, who has recently won the hearts of Australia and New Zealand.

So, what happened when Kate Moss met Prince William?

Surprisingly, the Queen of the catwalk appeared to come off a little shy - and perhaps even flirted with the Duke of Cambridge.

Curious: Kate Moss was captured asking Prince William about the whereabouts of his wife they attended a glittering gala dinner to celebrate the work of The Royal Marsden Hospital at Windsor Castle last night

Grinning from ear to ear: The supermodel asked the Duke of Cambridge: 'Where's your wife? She's not here?', to which the Prince appeared to confirm that the Duchess had stayed at home and not attended the dinner

Flirty: With her head tilted to the side, Kate described the Duchess's absence at the event as 'Such a shame'

The pair were overheard having a chat by a TV crew as they attended a glittering gala dinner to celebrate the work of The Royal Marsden Hospital at Windsor Castle last night.

Grinning from ear to ear and touching her left arm, Kate asked the Duke: 'Where's your wife?'

She then went on to say: 'She's not here?', to which the 
Prince appeared to confirm that his wife had not attended the dinner.

Tilting her head to the side and looking up into the Duke's eyes, Kate then smiled and said: 'Such a shame.'

Having a chat: The pair were captured speaking in Waterloo Chamber, a large room in Windsor Castle built in tribute to the success of Britain's victory against Napoleon in 1815. They were surrounded by 220 guests

The
 pair were captured speaking in Waterloo Chamber, where they were 
surrounded by 220 guests sipping champagne and eating canapés.

According to Sky News, the model, who wore a glamorous 
black dress, a green and silver bracelet and her hair wavy, finally asked the 
Duke: 'I'm sure it's nice being home now, right?'

Prince
 William and his wife have recently returned from a tour of Australia 
and New Zealand, on which they were accompanied by their son, Prince 
George.

Earlier in the evening, the Duke of Cambridge had met the dinner's sponsor, fashion designer Ralph Lauren, and immediately apologised for the Duchess's absence, saying: 'I'm sorry my wife's not here, you probably would far rather you saw my wife.'

Mr Lauren, who has 
announced he is funding an entire new breast cancer centre at the 
hospital, replied: 'Not at all'.

However, many guests last night will have no doubt been disappointed at the absence of the Duchess of Cambridge, a fashion ambassador if ever there were one.

But
 royal aides have made clear that she and William want to keep their 
engagements and charitable projects largely separate (although Kate has 
previously visited the Royal Marsden with her husband) in order to 
spread their influence more widely.

Kate Moss 
was not the only famous face to exchange words with the future King 
during yesterday's event, which was attended by the likes of model Cara 
Delvingne, photographer Mario Testino and actresses Cate Blanchett, Emma
 Watson and Helena Bonham Carter.

The Duke's designer-clad guests 
(many in Ralph Lauren, naturally) first enjoyed a drinks reception in 
the historic Waterloo Chamber, built in tribute to the success of 
Britain’s victory against Napoleon in 1815.

The chamber’s walls are covered 
with limewood carvings dating back to the 1680s, while the floor is 
covered with an Indian carpet woven by the inmates of Agra prison for 
Queen Victoria’s Golden Jubilee which is thought to be the largest 
seamless carpet in existence, weighing in at two tonnes.

Mr Lauren, 74, and his wife of 50 
years, Ricky, made a rare foray away from their home in the U.S. to attend
 the event with their three sons.

One, David, is married to the 
niece of former US President George Bush, model Lauren Bush – or Lauren 
Lauren, to use her married name.

In the Grand Reception Room, the Duke told the designer: 'It’s a wonderful thing you’re backing, it will be another great addition to the hospital.'

Afterwards,
 the 200-strong party walked through to the 
180-foot long St George’s Hall for a lavish three course dinner.

After
 meeting Mr and Mrs Lauren and The Royal Marsden’s chairman Ian Molson 
and chief executive Cally Palmer, the Duke met Emeli Sande before making
 his way into the Waterloo Chamber.

One
 of the first people he spoke to was Benedict Cumberbatch, who later 
said he felt 'guilty' for spending so much time chatting to him.

Exchanging words: One of the first people the Prince spoke to was Sherlock Holmes's Benedict Cumberbatch

Joking: He later chatted to actress Cate Blanchett, who was wearing a glamorous white dress and earrings

Tour: The Duke, his wife and Prince George have recently returned from a tour of Australia and New Zealand

He said: 
'He is just a stand-up guy. I completely forgot to ask him how he got 
over his jet lag from his trip to Australia because I was there at the 
same time and I saw all the commotion when he went to Sydney Opera 
House.

'Hopefully
 tonight will raise awareness of the work of The Royal Marsden - that’s 
what we’re here for. Cancer isn’t a disease that needs much awareness 
but it does need continued funding for research.'

The
 Duke also chatted to Laura Carmichael, one of three Downton Abbey stars
 at the event, together with Allen Leech, who plays former chauffeur Tom
 Branson, and Lily James, who plays Lady Rose MacClare.

Miss
 Carmichael, whose mother is a radiographer, said: 'We’re halfway 
through shooting the next series of Downton Abbey but the Duke didn’t 
ask for any plot details. He is probably waiting until it comes out in 
September.'

Singer: The A-list guests were all friends or supporters of the hospital, and after dinner they were looking forward to a performance by the award-winning singer Emeli Sande. Above, Prince William greets Ms Sande

Meal: Before the meal the Duke made a speech in which he spoke of the 'brilliant work' of the hospital and thanked Ralph Lauren for his 'incredibly generous' decision to fund its new breast cancer research unit

Standing next to Miss Carmichael was 
Helena Bonham Carter, who said: 'The Duke and I met before, along with 
the Duchess, before they were married, when I was staying on Mustique.

'I
 got very drunk at one point and I was determined to ask him to be a 
godfather to my daughter. He quite wisely said no. I admire him. He has 
got the same grace as both his parents.'

The
 guests then made their way into the Great Hall, where they took their 
places at two long rows of tables. The Duke sat between Ralph Lauren’s 
wife Ricky and Mr Molson. Opposite him was Ralph Lauren, who had Cate 
Blanchett on his left and Lady Bamford, wife of the JCB founder Lord 
Bamford, to his right.

Also seated near the Duke were David and Julia Koch, the American billionaire philanthropists.

Before
 the meal the Duke made a speech in which he spoke of the 'brilliant 
work' of the hospital and thanked Ralph Lauren for his 'incredibly 
generous' decision to fund the new breast cancer research unit at the 
hospital’s Chelsea site.

He 
added: 'I am enormously grateful to Ralph Lauren for his generosity, and
 to all of you who so kindly support the hospital. You should know that 
what you do saves lives and gives hope to thousands of people.'

William became President of the 
hospital in 2007, taking up a position once held by his mother. Last 
year he watched surgical procedures in one of the world famous cancer 
care centre’s operating theatres.

He
 also supports the work of the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity, a member of
 the Charities Forum of which the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and 
Prince Harry are patrons.

Officially,
 the dinner is being held 'to celebrate the innovative work of The Royal
 Marsden and bring together the Hospital’s world-leading consultants, 
supporters and philanthropists'.

Unofficially,
 it is a chance to dazzle wealthy supporters with an impressive array of
 royalty and celebrity to ensure their continued generosity.

The
 A-list guests were all friends or supporters of the hospital, and after 
dinner they were looking forward to a performance by the award-winning 
singer Emeli Sande.

Designer
 Ralph Lauren himself had a benign brain tumour removed 25 years ago and
 lost his close friend Nina Hyde to breast cancer in 1990.

He
 has donated millions to cancer research around the world over the past 
20 years including the proceeds from UK sales of his Pink Pony range of 
clothing and accessories to The Royal Marsden.

The Royal Marsden is the oldest, largest 
and most comprehensive cancer centre in Europe, with a history of 
ground-breaking research.
