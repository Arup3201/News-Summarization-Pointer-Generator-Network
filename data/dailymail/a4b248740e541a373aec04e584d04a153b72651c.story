A man who has been called Britain's most prolific shoplifter was back behind bars again today after admitting four more offences - bringing his total to 343.

A week ago magistrates at Prestatyn in North Wales released David Archer after he had spent two days in custody awaiting his appearance on offences 338 and 339.

But today magistrates in the same court remanded the 58-year-old in custody to await sentence at Mold Crown Court on April 11 after he admitted to four more offences, including theft from a charity shop.

Serial shoplifter: David Archer has admitted to four offences. He now has 343 and is believed to be Britain's most prolific shoplifter

Archer, of Mostyn, Flintshire, admitted stealing clothes and a camera from the RSPCA charity shop at Colwyn Bay and a collection box from the Co-op store at Llandudno Junction.

He also admitted two breaches of an indefinite ASBO imposed in 2006 which, among other things, prohibited him from entering any charity shop in England and Wales and from possessing a charity box.

Prosecutor Julie Jones said that he was seen on CCTV burning a piece of string which secured the charity box in aid of carers which was on the counter at the Llandudno Junction store.

Defence solicitor Roger Thomas told Prestatyn magistrates that one of the problems facing David Archer in the past was that whenever he was released from prison he was given only Â£40, which he had to spend on essentials, he had nowhere to live and was not entitled to emergency benefits.

'He is known in every shop in North Wales and there was no subterfuge involved,' he said. 'He is institutionalised and struggles to cope with life.'
