He was forced to apologize after skinny-dipping in the holy Sea of Galilee three years ago.

Now, Kansas Rep Kevin Yoder has been mocked in a campaign advert for the 2014 election.

Former state legislator Kelly Kultala, who is making an ambitious bid for the Kansas seat, chose to centre her campaign around the 36-year-old's dip in the lake during an official tour of Israel.

The video features a number of seemingly naked people urging viewers to support Kultala in November's election, while criticizing Yoder with a series of 'nude' puns.

Mocking: Former state legislator Kelly Kultala (pictured), who is making an ambitious bid for the Kansas seat, chose to centre her election campaign around Kevin Yoder's naked swim in the Sea of Galilee in 2011

Supporters: The video features a number of seemingly naked people, including this  elderly couple,  who contribute, 'The naked truth is, Yoder voted to cut Medicare for seniors', while posing in a swimming pool

Bringing up the past: At the start of the footage, Kultala tells viewers: 'A while back, Congressman Yoder made news by skinny-dipping on the job'. A man then cries 'cannonball!' before jumping into the pool (pictured)

Apology: Yoder (pictured) was forced to apologize after diving into the Seat Of Galilee naked as part of a meeting with Israeli Prime Ministe Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel Defeense Forces officers in August 2011

At the start of the footage, a blue-suited Kultala is pictured standing in front of a swimming pool, saying: 'A while back, Congressman Yoder made news by skinny-dipping on the job'.

A male 'cannonball!' cry is then heard and a figure is seen jumping into the pool, before the Democrat continues: 'But it's more shameless what he's doing to Kansas.'

Seconds later, an apparently nude elderly couple, posing with an inflatable in the pool, contribute: 'The naked truth is, Yoder voted to cut Medicare for seniors.'

A male worker lounging on a sunbed then alleges that Yoder 'opposed a raise for Kansas workers', before a seemingly naked woman says he 'stripped education funding for Kansas schools'.

Making a point: As a man cruises behind her on a lilo, the woman (pictured) continues: 'Yoder lines the pockets of his millionaire donors with big tax cuts and they line his... when he has pockets'

'Dramatic renenactment': A man, donning only armbands, is then seen standing beside the pool in a 'dramatic reenactment' of Yoder's dip in the Israeli sea, where Jesus Christ is said to have walked on water

As a man cruises behind her on a lilo, the woman continues: 'Yoder lines the pockets of his millionaire donors with big tax cuts and they line his... when he has pockets.'

A man, donning only armbands, is then seen standing beside the pool in a 'dramatic reenactment' of Yoder's skinny-dipping in the sea where Jesus Christ is said to have walked on water. 

Kultala ends the video saying: 'I'm Kelly Kultala. And I approve this message because congressman Yoder's record is nothing to blush about.'

Yoder dived into the Seat Of Galilee naked as part of a congressional delegation meeting with Israeli Prime Ministe Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel Defeense Forces officers in August 2011.

Underdog: Kultala ends the video saying: 'I'm Kelly Kultala. And I approve this message because congressman Yoder's record is nothing to blush about.' According to reports, she is an underdog in the election race

Holy: Yoder was one of six congressmen to jump in the Sea of Galilee (pictured) following a drunken night out

He was one of six congressmen who jumped in the lake following a drunken night out, prompting the FBI to launch a probe into the incident.  

The congressman, who was previously voted one of 'Hottest Freshmen in Congress, apologised for his 'disappointing' actions a year later.

He told The Kansas City Star: 'I feel incredibly remorseful that I have caused embarrassment to my constituents and have caused folks who believe in me to be disappointed.'

According to reports, Kultala is an underdog in her race against the two-term incumbent Yoder, who is believed to have amassed more than $2million in funding during the first six months of 2014.
