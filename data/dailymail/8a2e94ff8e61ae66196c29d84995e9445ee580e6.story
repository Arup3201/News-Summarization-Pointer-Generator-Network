A close friend and business associate of the murdered McStay family has been arrested after the victims were found buried in the desert.

Charles 'Chase' Merritt, 57, has been arrested for the murders of businessman Joseph Chase, his wife Summer, and their children Gianni and Joseph Jr, aged three and four.

He was taken into custody two days ago in Chatsworth, California, less than two hours' drive from the shallow graves where the beaten bodies were found.

Merritt, long the prime suspect in the case, had previously told MailOnline exclusively that he was being wrongfully harassed over the case, even saying: 'All I want is for them to find the a******s who did this.'

Prime suspect: Merritt has previously denied wrongdoing and said he hopes police find the 'a******s who did this'

Victims: Summer McStay, left, her sons Joseph Jr McStay, four, (center left), Gianni McStay, three (center right) and Joseph McStay (right) were found in shallow graves in the southern California desert last year

The couple and their boys vanished in February 2010 from their Fallbrook home in San Diego County, and were thought missing until the bodies were found three years later.

Corpses later identified as the McStays were dug up from a shallow grave. Investigations determined they had died of blunt force wounds, and now believe they were murdered at home.

Authorities announced his arrest in a news conference today, ahead of his first appearance in court today. Merritt was due to be arraigned at Victorville Courthouse, California.

But after a brief appearance the arraignment was pushed back to November 12.

A statement from the San Bernardino County Sheriff said: 'Chase Merritt was arrested without incident and transported to the West Valley Detention Center. He was booked for murder and is being held without bail. The District Attorney’s Office filed four counts of murder against Merritt.'

If found guilty of the murders, he could face the death penalty. Merritt was taken into custody on November 5, and is now in the West Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga, California, where he is being held with no bail. 

Authorities refused to discuss motives for the killing. But in a recent interview with ABC10 News, Joseph McStay's father Patrick said it was 'all money'.

He told the channel: 'We had information that took us straight to Merritt... It was all money... Joey had some big contracts he'd put together worth millions.'

McStay and Merritt were in a similar line of business - according to CNN, Merrit would often sell custom-made water fountains to McStay's more general garden business.

Investigators today said: 'Joseph McStay and Charles Merritt owned their own businesses, both related to waterfalls.

'They started working together and became friends.'

Speaking at the conference, Mike Ramos, the district attorney for San Bernadino County, said: 'This is a cold and callous murder of an entire family.'

He added that there is 'No reason, no motive for that ever to occur - especially for the young children, the most vulnerable victims.' 

Tearful members of the McStay family today remembered their loved ones and called for justice to be done over their killings.

Michael McStay, Joseph's brother, said: 'I just wanted to see it through to the end.

'Joseph was a great brother, a great father, he would've done anything to protect those boys and Summer and he tried to help Chase and provide work for this guy - and this is how he was repaid.

'I know he's in a better place - I know that sounds a little trite but this gives our family a little more closure, the opportunity to heal and move forward and he'll get what he's got coming to him.'

Susan McStay, Michael's mother, added: 'My son and his family was a beautiful family that did not deserve this, Joey was so generous and kind to so many people - I always kept hope that we'd find him.'

'...That phonecall [to say their bodies had been found] was the biggest shock of our lives. But I still had hope because I felt the strength and power from this team [of law enforcement officers]. They did a wonderful job.

Defiant: Last year in an exclusive MailOnline interview, Merritt denied wrongdoing and hoped police would find the 'a******s who did this' 

'Now I received that phonecall, and now there's a little more to our journey. I need justice from the law and the courts.'

A year ago, their skeletons were found in the desert outside Victorville. The site was not far off heavily traveled Interstate 15, which connects San Diego and Las Vegas.

Investigators said there were no signs of forced entry at the family's home or in their SUV, which was found parked near the U.S.-Mexico border.

Neither Joseph nor Summer had told family or friends they were leaving. When they were reported missing, authorities went to the house and found eggs that had rotted on the kitchen counter and two pet dogs in the backyard, indicating the family hadn't prepared for an extended leave.

Nothing was missing from the home, and the couple's credit cards and tens of thousands of dollars in bank accounts never were touched.

Last November, Charles Merritt was eulogizing the McStay family, he spoke with his 'best friend' Joseph McStay multiple times a day and had an exciting business venture in the pipeline.

Now, almost a year later, he has been charged with murdering McStay, his wife and his two children, aged three and four years old.

Merritt, who said he took a lie detector test to remove himself from suspicion, spoke at length about the murdered family in an exclusive interview with MailOnline last year.

Speaking from a restaurant in the Mojave Desert, he called for the law to catch whoever is responsible, and claimed he himself was 'the least violent man on the planet.'

In words which take on a chilling meaning after he was today charged with four counts of murder, he said: 'I was the last person Joseph saw.'

He then went on to describe a business meeting, and the last call from McStay's phone number - to him.

Merritt said: 'He came to Rancho Cucamonga on February 4 to talk to me about a huge business deal we had going on in Saudi Arabia.

‘We met for an hour-and-a-half for lunch. He was so excited. We had the Saudi Arabian project and a few other things going on.

'The business had never been so good and we were looking forward to the future. He did nothing to suggest there was anything wrong or untoward.

‘We both left and went home and I spoke to him on the phone about two or three times on his drive back to Fallbrook, all standard business stuff. The last time I spoke to him was around 6 o’clock.

‘It has been reported that I spoke to him in the evening, but that isn’t true. He did call me at 8.28pm, but I was watching a movie with my girlfriend, looked at the phone and decided not to answer.

'When you talk to Joseph it takes about half an hour, so I thought I’d catch up with him in the morning.

‘I didn’t answer that call and I regret it to this day.’

Merritt also responded to widespread accusations he was behind the killings - fueled in part by the revelation he had a criminal record and had served two jail sentences. He eventually agreed to a lie detector test in a bid to shake off suspicion.

Speaking of the crimes, he said: 'I regret it, but that doesn't give people the right to trash me, especially after I have lost my best friend.

‘Very soon after the disappearance, Lt Brugos who was leading the case, called me and asked if I would take a lie detector test, because he was convinced I knew where Joseph was.

‘I declined at first and got some advice from an attorney, who told me not to do it, because if anything at all shows up they will harass you.

‘But I spoke to my girlfriend about it extensively and decided, you know what, I’m just going to do the damn test, so they can forget about me and focus on something that might actually help find him.

‘About three of them came out to my attorney’s office in Palm Valley. They asked me whether I knew anything about the disappearance, and if I did know anything, would I tell them.

‘After I’d finished, Brugos’s partner said to me, "well there are a couple of inconsistencies" but that was just them trying to trick me into saying something. I didn’t hear any more about it after that.

‘Was I a suspect? Well, I don’t know if I’m the only one they asked to do a lie detector test, but I am the only one who actually agreed. They were certainly on my case.'

He said: ‘I may not be the nicest person in the world, but I have only ever had Joseph’s best interests at heart. That’s all I have ever cared about, despite what had been written about me.

‘I am a normal man, trying to take care of my three kids and I have lost a very good friend.

'I wasn’t Joseph’s best friend, but he was mine. I didn’t have many people close to me, but we shared a lot.'
