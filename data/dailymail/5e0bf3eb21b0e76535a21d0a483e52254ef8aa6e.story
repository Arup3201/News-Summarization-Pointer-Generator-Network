Seventeen young migrants were found crouching in the refrigerated trailer of a lorry yesterday carrying tomatoes from Morocco due to cross the Channel to Britain from Calais.

Several of the refugees, thought to include children, were given ambulance treatment for mild hypothermia and lack of oxygen after several hours in the freezing trailer but none required hospital treatment.

The driver of the lorry was unaware that the refugees had broken into his lorry and was alerted by the panic stricken migrants banging on the walls and screaming for help as they began to have difficulty breathing .

According to French reports the entire consignment of tomatoes worth several thousand pounds had to be dumped after the incident.

The lorry driver would have had to pay a fine of several thousand euros if the migrants had been discovered by Police at the UK border on the French side of the Channel.

Natacha Bouchart, Calais mayor, wants to urgently open a Sangatte style hostel for 400 migrants 

Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart has sparked fury in Britain by calling for a Sangatte style hostel for 400 migrants as a matter of urgency before the end of the year.

She revealed that she is to hold meetings with mayors of other ports and border towns in France, Spain and Italy which are overrun by migrants.

Her aim is to send a message to migrants telling them there is no easy gateway to the UK through Calais.

Her town is currently home to 1300 squatters sleeping rough and her deputy mayor warned that the figure could rise to 5000 by the end of the year if no action is taken.

The French Interior Minister is due in London today (Tuesday)to press for increased British security at the French port, and further support and financial aid from Britain.

Last week Bernard Cazeneuve revealed that in France 155 people smuggling networks were smashed and 1378 arrests made in the first six months of 2014, a 20percent more than during the whole of 2013.
