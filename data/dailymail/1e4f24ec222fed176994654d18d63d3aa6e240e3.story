It's believed the wife and two children are in a critical condition.

"It appears ... the father, he has taken a direct strike by lightning, it has then travelled into an 18-month-old male child," Queensland Ambulance spokesperson Michael Augustus told the ABC.

"There was also an adult lady, the mother, who also had with her a 12-week-old infant and unfortunately they all suffered some form of injury."

The incident comes as large hailstones and destructive winds pound parts of south-east Queensland.

Severe storms with golf-ball sized hail have hit Ipswich and south Brisbane.

The Bureau of Meteorology says the storms are moving northeast and are expected to hit Brisbane's bayside by 6pm (AEST).
