Sea levels are rising far faster than the latest estimates given by international climate change researchers, a new study has warned.

Rising tides have the potential to threaten the homes of billions of people living in coastal areas across the world and could spell disaster for low-lying megacities like Tokyo and London.

The new findings suggest that the oceans are rising around 60 per cent more quickly than the latest best estimates from the International Panel on Climate Change.

However the research found that the panel, which is derided by some as alarmist, was generally correct in its estimates of rising temperatures.

Stefan Rahmstorf from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research said that while global temperatures were rising within expectations, the 'more complex' problem of sea-level rises had outstripped predictions.

Dr Rahmstoft and colleagues from the Laboratoire d'Etudes en Géophysique et Océanographie Spatiales (LEGOS) in France and the U.S. based Tempo Analytics compared climate projections to actual observations from 1990 up to 2011.

Five global land and ocean temperature series were averaged and compared to IPCC projections.

To allow for a more accurate 
comparison with projections, the scientists accounted for short-term 
temperature variations due to El Niño events, solar variability and 
volcanic eruptions.

The 
results confirmed that global warming continues unabated at a rate of 
0.16 °C per decade and follows IPCC projections closely.

Data of sea-level rise, however, provided a different picture. The oceans are rising 60 per cent faster than the IPCC's latest best estimates, according to the new research.

Time is running out in the race to cut greenhouse gas emissions fast enough to keep global temperatures rises below 2C this century, the United Nations warns.

Greenhouse gases are being pumped into the atmosphere in such quantities that temperatures are likely to rise at least 3C and up to 5C by 2100 even if government pledges for are kept.

Governments must promise and put into action many more measures than they have already committed to if the world is to keep temperatures rises below 2C, scientists and UN officials said.

To do so, an international team of scientists said, annual greenhouse gas emissions must be slashed from about 50 gigatonnes (Gt) today to about 44GT by 2020.

The researchers compared those estimates to satellite data of observed sea-level rise and found that while the IPCC projected sea-level rise to be at a rate of 2mm per year, satellite data recorded a rate of 3.2 mm per year.

'Satellites have a much better coverage of the globe than tide gauges and are able to measure much more accurately by using radar waves and their reflection from the sea surface,' explained Anny Cazenave from LEGOS.

The increased rate of sea-level rise is unlikely to be caused by a temporary episode of ice discharge from the ice sheets in Greenland or Antarctica or other internal variabilities in the climate system, according to the study, because it correlates very well with the increase in global temperature.

'In contrast to the physics of global warming itself, sea-level rise is much more complex,' Dr Rahmstorf said.

'To improve future projections it is very important to keep track of how well past projections match observational data.'

He added: 'The new findings highlight that the IPCC is far from being alarmist and in fact in some cases rather underestimates possible risks.'
