A retired nurse died after shouting 'too hot, too hot' as she was lowered into a scalding hot bath at her care home, an inquest has heard.

Beatrice 'Betty' Morgan, 88, was a resident at Greencroft residential home in Aston, Shotton, when it was lowered into a bath with no working temperature valve in August 2012.

Staff at the home told an inquest in Wrexham yesterday that Miss Morgan, who had schizophrenia and dementia, screamed out in pain before she was removed from the bathtub.

The former career nurse was taken to the home's nurse and an ambulance was called. She was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital, before being moved to a specialist burns unit at Whiston Hospital, Merseyside, where she died on September 28, 2012.

Thermometer tests on another bath in the home without a valve after Miss Morgan's death by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) had readings of 50.7 and 50.3 degrees celsius. 

The company which ran the home, Greencroft Care Ltd which is now in liquidation, was fined £5,000 in September over the death, in a Health and Safety executive prosecution.

Miss Morgan formerly lived on the Wirral, and had been matron of Wrexham War Memorial Hospital during her long medical career.

Tracey Davies, acting home manager at the time, said there was no working valve on the bath to regulate its temperature at the time. 

Pathologist Dr Brian Rodgers, who conducted a post-mortem examination, said Miss Morgan suffered serious burns and wounds on her body were consistent with being lowered only a shallow depth into the scalding bath.

Recording a conclusion of accidental death, coroner John Gittens said there had been failings which contributed to Miss Morgan's death.

'I can only express a hope that this horrendous incident is a one-off, that other people are not placed at risk and have to suffer the horrendous incident which Betty Morgan had to endure at Greencroft,' he said.

Mr Gittins said that although people with dementia were prone to develop deep vein and pulmonary thrombosis, Mrs Morgan was doing quite well, despite her conditions, before the accident.

Mr Gittins recorded the cause of death as bronchial pneumonia and pulmonary embolism due to scalding to the lower legs, trunk and left arm. Senile dementia was listed as a contributory cause.

Mrs Davies said social care workers at the home received 12 weeks of intensive training, but she had not seen a bathing policy for the home.

She said she had been told the bath did not have a thermostatic valve to regulate its temperature by a builder, but that Greencroft Care Ltd director Timothy Ogunleye told her one could not be installed due to the costs involved.

Mr Ogunleye told the inquest he had not had such a conversation with her. He said managers at homes owned by the company were responsible for carrying out audits and informing him of problems.

Mr Ogunleye said when the company took over the home in 2011, it was contractually obliged not to change existing policies as the staff were familiar with them.

Nicky Heap, one of three staff involved in bathing Miss Morgan, said she ran hot water first on the day in question, but had to take another patient back to his room before returning to run the cold water. She took the temperature with a thermometer and logged the temperature as 38 degrees celsius, she said.

When questioned by coroner John Gittins, Ms Heap said she had not received guidance on mixing the water before taking the temperature and where to place the thermometer in the tub.

Ms Heap said she had no formal qualifications, but had shadowed other care workers.

Colleague Sophie Davies had stopped on the way to the bathroom to get Miss Morgan's towels.

She told the inquest she heard her screaming, but that Miss Morgan did this regularly when carers dealt with her.

However, when entering the room she saw Miss Morgan being hoisted out of the bath.

Miss Davies said the home's nurse told them to place cold towels on Miss Morgan and the nurse called 999.

She was not aware of the bath temperature log and 'what little knowledge' she had came from colleagues showing her what to do.

Susan Wooler, who was also involved in bathing Miss Morgan, said she had received training to perform the task.
