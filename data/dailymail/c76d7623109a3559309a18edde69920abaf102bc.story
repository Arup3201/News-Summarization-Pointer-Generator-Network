Meet the 'betches' - they think being nice is 'boring', looks are everything and it's better to manipulate men for money then earn it yourself with a job.

Their motto is 'if you don't have anything mean to say don't say it at all' and they abide by the rules: 'don't be easy, don't be ugly, don't be poor'.

According to childhood friends Jordana Abraham, 23, Samantha Fishbein and Aleen Kuperman, both 24: 'Life is not a box of chocolates. 
Instead, you should give that box of chocolates to someone else to eat, 
learn from their expanding ass what happens to people who sample 
chocolates as a hobby, and remain a size 2.'

It is this sort of wisdom that they 
dish out to their 140,500 Twitter followers and share on their website 
www.betcheslovethis.com.

The trio, all from Long Island, coined being a 'betch' while they were at the Ivy League university, Cornell. They initially posted their 'five things betches love' (talking s***, not keeping up with the news, studying abroad, birthdays and diets)  on Facebook and as their popularity soared they developed the website that now has 3.7million page views a month.

Samantha told The Times: 'We didn't intend it to be a business. It all just happened.'

The site has been so successful in the U.S. - mostly with females aged 18-24 - that they have also published a 'self-help' book, called 'Nice Is Just A Place in France', and an online shop where fans can buy merchandise emblazoned with the betch mottoes including 'I want to lose three pounds'.

They now operate from an office in Manhattan with ten staff writers, are in talks for a TV show, and plan to expand abroad, including to the UK, where a number of their betch idols reside including Pippa Middleton and Kate Moss.

Success: The website gets 3.7million page views a month and has spawned a book and possible TV show

In their book, they make comments such as: 'Niceness is boring and overrated. Girls who think that being 'nice' is something to aspire to are most likely setting themselves up for a life of mediocrity, boredom, and cats.'

They add: 'You should learn to be a girl who looks out for herself first and does not allow others to take advantage of her. Ideally, you should be doing the advantage-taking.'

They state that a 'betch' should be 'edgy, speak her mind, and commands a room just by being in it.'

And yet somewhat contradictorily, they state this should be done without trying to command any power in the world or by striving for any worthwhile achievements. This is perhaps epitomised by Aleen who studied pre-med at university but has now given up career plans to be a doctor to instead continuing expanding the betch business. 

'It's a lot of shock value. We're trying to be funny but hopefully not too horrifying'

Thus they now delve out the following career advice in their book: 'It’s important to realise that as a woman, you have the special privilege of not needing to work as hard as men do - in the general sense - unless you want to.

'The truth is that men pretty much gave up their right to demand we do anything, if you consider that for most of human existence, society ran pretty smoothly without our involvement. We don’t have to be the bread-winning gender if we don’t want to be, and we are f***ing happy about that.

'Don’t get us wrong, we’re definitely progressive and want our s***-talking voice to be heard. We’re just saying it’s perfectly okay to let men believe they are superior beings without whom civilization would crumble. Regardless of whether you agree, this ego boost is exactly what they need to do things for you (e.g., pay for dinner, overachieve on work projects, propose marriage).'

In line with this, their role models and 'betch of the week' are women who have achieve fame with seemingly little talent such as the Kardashians.

They state: 'Make fun of the Kardashians all you 
want, but Kris Jenner has essentially manipulated the entire world into 
becoming obsessed with her family’s every move. Armed with only a sex 
tape and a marital bond to a tight-faced Olympian, the family used what 
they had to become an American dynasty.'

Get the book, get the T-shirt: Betch fans can buy merchandise featuring their mottoes such as 'I wanna lose three pounds'

The betch phenomenon will shock and appall many - but if that's the case you've missed the joke according to the founders.

'Of course it's satire,' Jordana told The Times. 'The betch voice has become very easy to us. It's like an evil whisper in our heads. The alter egos we've made... it's extremely exaggerated and a bit ridiculous.'

Aleen adds: 'It's a lot of shock value. We're trying to be funny but hopefully not too horrifying.'

However, it seems the trio don't always succeed in this given many of their fans are impressionable young girls who don't get the satire. As a result the website has been criticised for encouraging eating disorders by championing being skinny, even if to them it's tongue in cheek.

Samantha told The Times: 'None of us would ever want girls to hurt themselves. I feel bad that people out here might be taking it seriously, but we can't be responsible for everyone who reads our stuff It should be obvious that it is satire.'

Victoria Beckham: 'Proof that image means everything'

Victoria Beckham

'Why? Because she was hot, skinny, 
never seemed to give a s***, and her Spice Girls alias, Posh, didn’t suggest that 
she was a monster, a toddler, or an Asian seasoning.

'The reason why Victoria Beckham 
became an icon is proof enough that the image you make for yourself 
means everything.

'Sure her cheat days consist of a fish egg and two 
strawberries, but if that’s what it takes to be married to David Beckham
and produce a litter of Anne Geddes models while never gaining a pound,
so be it.'

Pippa Middleton: 'The only thing anyone says about her is that she's hot'

Pippa Middleton

'When she's not being photographed walking down the street holding a new handbag every other day, she spends two days a week 'working' for her parents' party company and spends all the other days um, going to parties.

'She's even getting paid to (have someone else) write a book about parties. There's something to be said for a betch who literally writes the book on partying.

'But seriously, the girl could be a deaf and blind zombie and no one would know because the only thing anyone says about her is that she's hot.'

Kate Moss: 'Almost fat'

Kate Moss

'Kate Moss has been accused of being anorexic since she was 14 years old and betch haters all over the world have been trying to say she promotes anorexia because they’re jealous of her.

'All these activists for eating seriously need to shut up. I mean, Wikipedia says she’s a size 2 and that’s almost fat.'

Queen Elizabeth II: 'The Queen of doing nothing'

The Queen

'We usually aren’t huge fans of old people who wear pastel colored hats, but Elizabeth II is the best queen to come out of England since Elton John.

'We were born-again fans when she graced the Olympic opening ceremonies with her famous pout and new Bond Girl status.

'At the tea-scented age of 86, the only thing older than this betch of the week is her tiara.

'Elizabetch is literally the queen of not doing work. Born into a life of luxury, she makes the Kennedys look like the Hiltons.'
