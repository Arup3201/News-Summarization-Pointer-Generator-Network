A bird took a break from gathering food for a spot of gymnastics - and ended up mimicking Jean-Claude Van Damme's famous Volvo advert.

The flexible tit was spotted by photographer Jeffrey Van Daele, while visiting the Bourgoyen-Ossemeersen Nature Reserve in Ghent, Belgium.

Jeffrey, 38, admitted he was shocked to see such a rare bird - a bearded tit - in the nature reserve he has visited many times and only seen brief glimpses of the creature.

As he prepared to snap the bird searching for food, the tit instead clutched two cattails in its claws before pulling a pose the Belgian martial arts legend would be proud of.

Jeffery, who took the picture on January 5 this year, said: 'The bearded tit is a such rare bird in the nature reserve I visit.

'I've visited the place about 10 times before waiting for several hours and only ever been lucky enough to see the birds for a few minutes.

Trick: The camera starts on his glaring face, and as it pans back he is lowered between the two trucks

'A lot of my friends compare the shot with the epic Jean-Claude Van Damme moment.

'Luckily for me it was this time I got lucky and could photograph them for almost two hours.'

Bearded tits are known for being sociable and charismatic in the bird world.

They are usually seen flying at a pace over reeds and swooping fast on food.
