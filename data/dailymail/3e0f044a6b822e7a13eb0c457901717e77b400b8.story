A severe weather warning has been issued across Britain tomorrow, as temperatures are set to plummet to -88C tomorrow - followed by a leap of 177C to 88C later in the day.

Or at least that's the forecast according this morning's BBC Breakfast - which flashed up the somewhat extreme conditions on a satellite map during this morning's show.

Weather presenter Carol Kirkwood stood in front of the screen as it showed how freezing temperatures - only ever found at the Antarctic in the depths of winter - descended upon Norwich, Glasgow and the Shetland Islands for tomorrow morning at 5am.

The next screen then showed a sizzling 88C for Stornoway, Aberdeen, the Channel Islands and the Shetland Islands for later in the day at 4pm.

'The rest of Scotland is under the influence of a weather front...' Ms Kirkwood began - as the technical blunder was noticed.

A temperature of 88C would have put Britain at the top of the weather record map - the hottest confirmed temperature on earth being a comparatively cool 56.7C in Death Valley, California

The freak conditions would be fairly isolated, the map suggested, as the rest of the country was forecast to enjoy normal to pleasantly warm temperatures for the time of year, ranging from 11C in the morning to 20C later in the day.

Ms Kirkwood's colleagues were quick to point out the technical blunder.

Presenter Bill Turnbull said: '88C is well above average, I don’t know what clothes to wear now.'

Co-presenter Susanna Reid joked: 'When you said changeable, I didn’t know quite what you meant.'

Ms Kirkwood tried to explain the slip-up, saying: 'The new data must be coming into the system.'

The BBC said: 'This was a technical glitch that we fixed as soon as it was noticed.'

 THE HOTTEST...                                                      ... AND THE COLDEST
