This is the moment a 20-year-old American student was led in handcuffs into an Italian police station after he allegedly stabbed his best friend 25 times while he slept. 

Reid Alexander 
Schepis was arrested after the frenzied assault in Rome  following a drug-fueled night of Halloween partying in Rome. Schepis reportedly has no recollection of what happened.

The victim, New Jersey-born Fabio Malpeso, 19, was awake and talking to police after the violent attack.

Malpeso is a student at John Cabot University, an American school in the Italian capital, and the shocking attack came on the five-year anniversary of the stabbing death of British exchange student, Meredith Kercher - whose roommate Amanda Knox was convicted and ultimately exonerated in her friend's 2007 death.

Victim: New Jersey-born Fabio Malpeso has regained consciousness after he was brutally attacked early on Thursday morning. The 19-year-old (left, pictured with his sister Federica) is a student at John Cabot University, a private American college in Rome

Schepis is an 
American-born student who attends the same university. with both U.S. and Italian citizenship and was 
arrested early on Thursday in the apartment they shared overlooking 
the Colosseum.

Malpeso had surgery for stab wounds to his lungs and other parts of his body.

The incident occurred on the five year anniversary of the stabbing death of Meredith Kercher, who was killed on the evening of November 1, 2007.

Her American roommate Amanda Knox and Knox's then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were accused of Kercher's death and were convicted after a widely publicized trial in December 2009. 

Their convictions were eventually overturned in October 2011 and both were set free.

On Saturday, a judge confirmed Schepis'
arrest and said he will decide in the next day on a defense request that 
Schepis be held under house arrest.

He
is currently in police custody as they probe the attack. Police have 
said a motive for the attack is unclear, but they suspect ‘drug- and 
alcohol-related delirium’ might be a factor.

Attorney Vincenzo Comi, who represents Schepis, told NBC News that his client told the judge that he ‘did not remember anything of the episode.’

On the night of the incident, Malpeso, Schepis and two unnamed men went to a club called the Atlantic, where they were ‘drinking alcohol, smoking hashish and taking what he was told was ecstasy.'

Anniversary: The victim Meredith Kercher (far left) was found dead with stab wounds to her throat on November 1, 2007. Her American roommate Amanda Knox (center) and Knox's then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito (right), were convicted of her murder in 2009 but their convictions were overturned in 2011

Comi said his client started feeling ill and has little or no recollection of what happened until he woke up the next day in a police cell.

The boys are both in their second year of university, but are believed to be longtime friends whose parents also know each other.

A third man, an Italian in his thirties named Andrea Rinaldi, suffered injuries to his arms and hands trying to defend Malpeso, and was also in the hospital, police said.

Overwhelmed: Amanda Knox sobbed in October 2011 when she learned her murder conviction was overturned

Rinaldi is the boyfriend of Malpeso's sister, Federica. The couple had returned to the flat about 6am on Thursday and had not gone to the club with the foursome, as earlier reported.

The two unnamed youths with Schepis and Malpeso had returned to the flat, too, but left before Malpeso was stabbed about 7.45 am, according to court testimony.

John Cabot's president, Franco Pavoncello, described the crime as a ‘tragic event' in a statement.

In a message on the university's website, he said press or social media ‘rumors’ do not accurately reflect what happened, but offered no details. He urged prayers for the families of the victim and alleged assailant.

Shock: John Cabot University was incorporated in Delaware but operates in Italy, with two campuses. It is a close knit community, with class sizes that average 15 students
