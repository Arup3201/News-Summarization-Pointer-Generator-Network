There were some anxious moments for passengers when an El Al Airlines plane carrying nearly 200 people was forced to make an emergency landing on just one engine on Saturday night.

One of the Boeing 767-300 aircraft’s engines malfunctioned shortly after it departed Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv while en route to Toronto’s Pearson International Airport.

The flight crew notified the control tower of the malfunction and then requested permission to return to the airport, where the aircraft landed safely.

Rescue teams were on standby as a precaution when the aircraft, carrying 194 passengers, made the unscheduled landing at Tel Aviv's international airport.

Rami Nir, head of ground operations for the Israel Airports Authority, told Arutz Sheva that the passengers disembarked and returned to the terminal, where they were taken care of by El Al staff. 

He added: ‘I'd like to note that throughout the whole process the passengers were not in any danger.’

El Al Airlines said the malfunction occurred about half an hour after the plane took off from Tel Aviv.

The cause of the engine malfunction is under investigation.

Passengers disembarked from the plane and waited inside the terminal until another aircraft was available
