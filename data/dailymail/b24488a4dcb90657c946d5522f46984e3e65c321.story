New York faces the prospect of being without power for a week today after Superstorm Sandy caused mass blackouts and triggered a series of explosions.

In total, more than six million Americans across the Eastern Seaboard have been affected after the devastation wreaked by Superstorm Sandy caused power cuts on an unprecedented scale.

In New York alone, more than 600,000 residents are without power after an explosion at a Manhattan power plant.

Con Edison, the utilities company that provides power to 3.3million customers in metropolitan New York, as well as a further 301,000 in southeastern New York and northern New Jersey, said around 50,000 power outages in downtown Manhattan in 
Battery Park and the Financial District were part of a planned cut and will take around three days to restore.

But much of the damage was caused by the explosion at the 14th street power station will take up to a week to repair as restoring electrical service to underground equipment requires the cleaning away of sea water to
all components, drying and testing to make it safe to 
restore power.

In addition to the flood waters, heavy winds have downed power lines across the region.

A company statement said: 'Con Edison is reporting power outages to a large section of Manhattan stretching from East 39th Street to the lower tip of Manhattan.

'The outage was caused by flooding in company substations and engineers are working to correct the problem.

'This will be one for the record books,' said John Miksad, senior vice president for electric operation at Con Edison. 'This will be the largest storm-related outage in our history.'

The previous record was more than 200,000 customers affected by Hurricane Irene in 2011, the company added.

The company released that 193,000 customers have lost power in Manhattan, 158,000 in Westchester County, 74,000 in Queens, 71,000 in Brooklyn, 76,000 in Staten Island and 38,000 in the Bronx as of 1am Tuesday.

Because a customer is defined as an individual meter, the actual number of people affected is much higher.

Con Ed spokesman Alfonso Quiroz told the New York Daily News that company 'storm riders' were monitoring water levels and that when they reached a certain threshold the order would be passed along to cut power.

He said: 'If the water level comes to a certain point we will have to preemptively power some equipment down,' Quiroz said.

'It makes it easier and faster for us to make restorations. If we don’t, it will burn out.'

ConEd also cut steam service to 140 customers in Manhattan. If steam pipes become inundated in cold water, they can explode.

Mr Miksad said the cuts caused by downed overhead power lines outside major cities could be the trickiest to repair.

'The overhead is going to be a slog,' he said.

In New Jersey, more than 1,900,000 residents are without power, 800,000 in Long Island, 640,000 in Connecticut, 390,000 in Virginia, 290,000 in Maryland and Washington DC, 68,000 in West Virginia, 10,000 in Massachusetts and 125,000 in New Hampshire.

In all, 6,536,895 customers are without power and the number of outages could still go up as the storm continues.

'This will be the largest storm-related outage in our history,' said one power executive

After a back-up generator failed, New York University's Tisch Hospital began evacuating more than 200 patients to other facilities, including 20 babies from neonatal intensive care, some of them on respirators operating on battery power.

Without power, the hospital had no elevator service, meaning patients had to be carefully carried down staircases and outside into the weather. Gusts of wind blew their blankets as nurses held IVs and other equipment.

Spokeswoman Lorinda Klein said: 'They evacuated everybody.' She could not say what had caused the failure of the hospital’s emergency systems, which power critical care units there.

Many New Yorkers took to the streets to experience the city as it's rarely seen - dark.

'It’s not too often you get to see the city dark,' Greg Pearl, 26, an accountant who was taking pictures on the East Side told the New York Post.

'I haven’t seen lower Manhattan shut down before. It’s kind of amusing,' said Jonathan Lee, 25, who walked across the Williamsburg Bridge.

'It’s like an apocalypse, like a movie,' added his friend Paul Parhar.

The
 huge explosion took place at a power station on 14th Street around 8.30pm, 
knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the surrounding 
areas, and it could take a week to restore power.

Amateur video footage shows a fiery 
explosion followed by two large bursts of blue light at the Consolidated
 Edison station on the east side of Manhattan, close to the river.

According a local TV station Pix 11, blue sparks were shooting from the plant and the buildings fell into darkness.

People living in Brooklyn posted 
cameraphone videos online of the incident.

It was initially thought that workers were trapped inside, but Con Edison's vice-president later told DNAinfo.com that no one was in or on the building.

A power company exec called it 'the largest storm-related outage in our history'

Con Edison engineers were working to 
restore power to an estimated quarter of a million people in Manhattan 
who were now without power for at least seven hours.

'It was scary!' said Maritza Mercado, 40, on East 6th Street.

'I was watching TV, looked outside the window and heard a big explosion and saw a big flash of white light like a firecracker.'

Twitter user Bucky Turco said: 'Huge explosion just rocked the East Village, everything went dark and I mean dark. #Sandy I'm now legit scared.'
