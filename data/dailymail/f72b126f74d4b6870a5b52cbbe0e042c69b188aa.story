Rescued: The panicking dog calmed down after being cooled with wet towels and pulled from the car

A panicking dog left inside a car in sweltering heat was rescued after it set off the vehicle's alarm.

The dog had been left in the back of a blue Chrysler people carrier next to the seafront in Exmouth, Devon, for around an hour as temperatures soared to 30C on Friday afternoon.

Witnesses said it was yelping and barking to be let out of the car, where the front windows were only slightly open, and that it had no water.

A police officer smashed the back window of the car after being called by a dog warden at around 1.15pm.

They cooled the dog with wet towels to calm it down before lifting it out.

As soon as it was released it 'went nuts', according to one onlooker, but later relaxed and appeared to have no lasting damage.

Richard Benford, who witnessed the incident, said: 'A lady who appeared to be some sort of animal warden climbed through the 
small smashed window to get the dog, which was brave because it 
could have bitten her.

'The dog was clearly distressed and hard to handle. They put wet towels 
on it before it was calm enough to push through the window.

'It was clearly traumatised and went out of control. It was shocking.

'A crowd of around 40 people had formed to watch what was happening. We all applauded when the dog was freed.

'Clearly people were very concerned about the dog but were also very 
angry.

Smashed: A police officer was called to break the rear window of the people carrier to free the dog

'I believe the front window might have been opened a little but 
nowhere near enough for that heat. Especially as the dog was in the 
back.'

A police spokesman said: 'The dog was in distress inside the car and had managed to set off the car alarm.

'The officer managed to get some wet towels inside to cool it off but 
was unable to get it out of the car so smashed the window the free the 
dog.

'The owner turned up at around the same time and the RSPCA are being informed off the matter.'
