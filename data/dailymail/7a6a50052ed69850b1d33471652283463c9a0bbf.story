A former beauty queen and nine of her family members narrowly avoided boarding AirAsia flight 8501 after they failed to check an email telling them that their flight time had changed.

Miss Indonesia runner-up 2008 Anggi Mahesti was supposed to board the lost plane, from Juanda International Airport, in Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore, on Sunday at 7.30am.

Fortunately she and her family didn't see an email on 15 December, or answer calls from the airline, telling them their departure time had been brought forward to 5.35am.

They arrived at the airport in two separate cars, just as the final boarding call was ringing out. Only 42 minutes later, the flight disappeared off the radar.

‘An airport official told my husband it was a Christmas gift from God to our family,’ Mahesti told Bloomberg news.

‘We decided not to fly after that because we were scared and didn’t want to tempt fate.’

The 27-year-old, her husband Ari Putro Cahyono, mother-in-law and their two children were supposed to be flying off for a week’s holiday in Singapore with her husband's brother-in-law Joedhey Ribawantodwi, his wife Christianawati and their three children.

The family only learned flight 8501 had gone missing when an airport official approached them at 9am and said: ‘This must have been the best Christmas gift your family ever received.’

‘The flight you were supposed to be on has crashed,’ Christianawati recalled being told.

She toldFairfax Media the whole family ‘felt completely limp’ when they heard the news.

Her husband recalled watching other passengers sprint through the airport gates in time to catch flight 8501, while he waited for the other half of his family group to arrive at the airport.
