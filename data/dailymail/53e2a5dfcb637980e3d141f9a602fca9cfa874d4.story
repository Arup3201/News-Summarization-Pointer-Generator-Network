A family's possessions went up in flames as they moved home from Glasgow to Dorset when their removal van caught fire just 30 miles from their final destination.

The family, who have not been identified, were moving to their new home in Weymouth, Dorset, when smoke started to fill the cab of the Britannia Caledonian removals lorry.

Driver Alan Cameron, 40, stopped the vehicle when he spotted the acrid smoke had entered the cab and flames were licking at his feet.

As Mr Cameron and colleague Derek Pickles, 31, leapt to safety the entire lorry caught fire and became engulfed in 30ft tall flames.

Firefighters put out the fire and managed to salvage around 30 per cent of the possessions.

An ambulance crew treated the two removalmen for smoke inhalation at the scene.

The Britannia Caledonian lorry had travelled 460 miles without any problems but began filling with smoke on the A31 at Corfe Mullen, Dorset.

Station manager Julian Lockwood, from Dorset Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'The two drivers saw flames were licking at their feet so they pulled over as quickly as possible.

'The fire crew from Wimborne attended in five minutes and in that time a 30ft flame had reached up to the street light and the flames were engulfing the whole cab.

'It's terribly sad because a family's worldly belongings have been lost in that van.'

Mr Cameron said he felt lucky to be alive following the incident at 10.15am yesterday.

He said: 'It was about a minute between seeing the smoke, to us stopping and then the whole thing going up in flames.

'It
is terrifying because if we had driven another 100m we would have been 
right next to a petrol station. I don't even want to think about what 
could have happened.

'I feel very lucky to be alive.'

Mr Pickles said: 'It was all just such a shock because it all happened so quickly. We are lucky to have escaped with our lives.'

Police said the lorry was containing hazardous canisters but the cause of fire has been deemed an accidental electrical fault.
