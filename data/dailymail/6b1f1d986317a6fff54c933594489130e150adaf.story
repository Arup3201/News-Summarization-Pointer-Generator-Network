Michael Bloomberg spent more than $650million of his own fortune as mayor of New York, spending on everything from installing and cleaning tropical fish tanks for City Hall to funding a small theater in Queens and $268million for three election campaigns.

The lavish spending by New York's second-richest man, worth an estimated $27billion, is unprecedented in city history.

He used his incredible fortune to prop up city agencies, fund the arts, launch and maintain charitable initiatives and make political contributions to causes like gun control and immigration reform.

Some spending was personal - paying for breakfast and lunch for his staffers and personally financing trips around the country and around the world in his private jet.

Regular guy? Mayor Michael Bloomberg often rode the 6 train to work - but quietly spent $650million of his fortune as mayor

Of lesser means: Bill De Blasio, who takes over as mayor on Wednesday, lives in an un-renovated brownstone in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and is married to a poet

Critics, and even some of his own advisers, say the spending essentially bought him City Hall. He dramatically outspent rivals in each of his election campaigns and they argue his generous donations to key charities helped secure the support - or at least the silence - of key political groups.

The New York Times analyzed city records, philanthropic databases and travel itineraries to estimate that Bloomberg spent at least $650million in his 12 years in City Hall.

The newspaper says this tally is undoubtedly low and does not account for private dinners Bloomberg threw at his own home and a variety of other expenses.

Bloomberg leaves office at 12.01am on Wednesday. A decidedly less wealthy successor will take his place. Bill De Blasio, a lifelong public servant who is married to a poet, lives in an un-renovated brownstone in Park Slope, Brooklyn.

Bloomberg himself has publicly expressed his distaste for talking about his own wealth and refused to speak to the Times about the $650million figure.

Bloomberg spent a reported $24million on his personal jet, a Dassault Falcon 900LX, and another $6million flying around the world on mayoral business

The New York Times account of Michael Bloomberg's spending while mayor offers insight into the Billionaire's priorities.

Here are a few excerpts from the Times' account:

The 71-year-old Boston native made his extensive fortune by founding Bloomberg LP, which designs and sells advanced financial software. His company, which brought in $7.1billion in revenue last year alone, helped pioneer the use of computers on Wall Street and made Bloomberg an exceedingly wealthy man.

He is the seventh richest man in the United States and the second richest in New York - behind only David H. Koch, co-founder of Koch Industries, according to Forbes.

The politically-active Koch brother, who had grabbed headlines for his support for the Tea Party and other libertarian-leaning causes - is worth an estimated $34billion.

Bloomberg's spending was diverse and touched nearly every corner of the nation's largest city.

He spent $263million on New York city charities, including the arts and programs for the poor.

He gave the Metropolitan Museum of Art $30million to pay for wifi and audio tours that reaches 'everyone who walks through the door' of the museum, officials said.

He also spent $30million on a program to help poor black and Latino men.

On a smaller scale, he gave $100,000 a year to Queens Theatre in the Park, a small outer-borough arts organization. Organizers describe the grants as 'manna from heaven.'

He also committed heavily to politics.

His three election campaigns - including for a highly controversial third term - cost him $268million.

He also gave out $23million in campaign donations to allies and candidates he believed shared his ideology.

He also paid $7million for his gun control campaign - including stirring post-Newtown school shooting TV spots. Pro-immigration reform causes got $5.7million and a campaign encouraging volunteerism cost the mayor $6.2million.

Bloomberg also spent lavishly to make his life at City Hall easier. He turned down the $2.7million salary he would have earned in 12 years, taking just $1 a year instead.

The mayor likes tropical fish, so he paid to install two giant aquariums in City Hall. Then paid $62,400 to have them cleaned every week for the last 12 years.

He also spent $5million renovating Gracie Mansion, the official residence of the mayor, even though Bloomberg himself never lived there. De Blasio and his family are expect to move in after he takes office.

He paid for breakfast and light lunch for his entire staff every day - a cost of about $890,000 over the course of his tenure.

Then there's travel. The mayor doesn't fly anywhere if it's not on his private jet. Price tag: $28million.

He's used the plane to ferry himself and a cadre of city aides and security guards around the world - including a $500,000 trip to China.

The Times estimates he spent $6million on travel during his tenure.
