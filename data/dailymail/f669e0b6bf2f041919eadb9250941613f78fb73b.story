Prince Charles is said to be 'furious' over the controversy that has arisen out of the postponed BBC documentary based on the royal family's relationship with the media.

The Prince has seen two of the royal household's most influential officials become embroiled in an embarrassing row over the show, which was supposed to be televised this evening.

The documentary, Reinventing the Royals, investigates the methods used by the Prince to enhance his public image following the death of Princess Diana - and to integrate Camilla Parker Bowles into palace life – a campaign dubbed 'Operation Mrs PB'.

'Furious': The Prince of Wales is said to be furious at the controversy that has arisen from the postponed BBC documentary Reinventing The Royals

The BBC was forced to postpone the show after Prince Charles's staff at Clarence House refused to supply archive footage, The Sunday Times reports.

The refusal is the pinnacle of a row between Sally Osman, the director of communications at Buckingham Palace, and Kristina Kyriacou, Charles's top media adviser.

Ms Osman, who works mainly for Prince William and the Queen, is said to be an old friend of Steve Hewlett - the BBC reporter behind Reinventing the Royals.

The Buckingham Palace official is in favour of Mr Hewlett's project - despite his previous job as head of Panorama when it shook the royals in 1995 by broadcasting Princess Diana's confession of adultery.

But others, including Ms Kyriacou, are thought to be wary of the production.

One royal source told the Sunday Times: 'Steve kept coming in with all these requests and they were being granted and no-one was going back to him asking 'what sort of programme are you making?'

'There are still people who think of (Hewlett) as this incredibly toxic person. The Prince of Wales is furious with the way this has been handled and Osman's role in it.' 

Ms Osman is said to have a 'stressful relationship' with Ms Kyriacou despite the pair insisting they work with each other on a daily basis.

Ms Osman's style is thought to be more corporate - and the PR expert sees her job as managing the Prince's role in the succession process.

Ms Kyriacou on the other hand is fuelled by the desire to protect Charles's reputation and public image while also promoting his personal interests.

Palace officials have blamed Ms Kyriacou for 'giving oxygen' to the row over the documentary by withholding archive footage.

But others have also criticised Ms Osman's relationship with BBC reporter Steve Hewlett, saying it 'wasn't appropriate'.

The BBC said the documentary had been postponed to resolve issues surrounding archive footage, but the Radio Times said Clarence House had intervened to halt the programme.

Clarence House has previously denied asking for the show to be cancelled or postponed, but royal sources confirmed there had been 'detailed' talks with the BBC throughout the making of the documentary, The Telegraph reports. 

The footage includes the first-ever television interview with Sandy Henney, who was press secretary to Prince Charles at the time of Princess Diana's death.

Even before the accident, the Prince was worried his image was 'in tatters' while the Royal family were also alarmed by the anti-monarchist feeling following the Diana's death in Paris.

'(Charles) was getting some pretty virulent criticism - bad father, unloving husband,' Ms Henney said in the documentary.

'I think he was pretty hurt... if you've got a middle-aged balding man and a beautiful princess, it's a no-brainer as to who is going to get the media coverage.'

Steve Hewlett presents the show and describes how Prince Charles hired Mark Bolland from the Press Complaints Commission to act as a spin doctor for the Royal family following Diana's death.

Prince William is said to have felt uneasy with Mr Bolland's position and referred to him as 'Blackadder'.

The spin doctor features heavily in both parts of Reinventing the Royals. 

Behind the argument over the documentary, which began filming almost a year ago, lies a broader conflict over the Prince's role in the years to come.

Since her appointment, Sally Osman has been faced with the challenging task of uniting the diverse PR teams of the Queen, Prince Charles and the younger royals.

This goal was damaged by Charles's decision to stick with long-serving aide Ms Kyriacou, who previously worked for Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Gary Barlow.

A BBC source said that uniting the press offices was seen as way of keeping Prince Charles on the straight and narrow - but the job is difficult as Ms Kyriacou always has Charles's ear.

The pair get on extremely well and Ms Kyriacou understands the way the Prince likes to work - more so than Ms Osman, according to a Sunday Times source.
