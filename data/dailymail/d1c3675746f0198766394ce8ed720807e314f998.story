Angelina Jolie turned 39 on Wednesday, but thanks to her flawless skin she doesn't seem to have aged in years.

Now, according to Us Weekly, the secret to her youthful appearance has been revealed: an $800 treatment called the Triad facial, administered by New York dermatologist David Colbert, which combines microdermabrasion, laser and a glycoloic peel.

Dr Colbert, whose office is in Manhattan, has also treated Naomi Watts, Michelle Williams and Rachel Weisz, all of whom are fans of the Triad facial.

Angelina reportedly first met Dr Colbert in 2010 on the set of Salt, where he treated her for a minor cut. Since then, she has come to swear by his 30-minute treatments.

The Oscar winner also uses Dr Colbert's line of skincare products, which range in price from $52 for a purifying cleanser to $165 for night cream.

According to his website, the Triad facial is a three-part process: gentle microdermabrasion to remove dead skin cells, then laser toning to even pigmentation, and finally a gentle chemical peel that 'imparts a fresh, youthful radiance and silkiness to skin.'

It can cost between $800 and $1,200, depending on the type and strength of the chemical peel as well as the number of laser pulses performed.

One of the benefits of the treatment is that it doesn't produce redness, which means A-listers can have it last-minute before attending important events.

'It gives immediate results and, most importantly, there's no downtime,' the dermatologist told the Hollywood Reporter.

Dr Colbert first gained attention in 2010, after Naomi Watts said in Life & Style magazine that she credited his skin care line for her flawless complexion.

Supporters: Michelle Williams, 33,  (left in 2012) apparently visited Dr Colbert's temporary clinic in Beverly Hills before this year's Oscars. And Rachel Weisz, 44, (right, in 2013) swears by his treatments, too

Oprah endorsed his 'heal and soothe' night cream in the July 2010 issue of O Magazine, and Fitness magazine featured his facial disks as some of the 'secrets to perfect skin' in the February 2013 issue.

In February, Dr Colbert set up a temporary pre-Oscar beauty clinic in Beverly Hills, so that actresses could enjoy a 20-minute version of his signature Triad facial before hitting the red carpet.
