When Xabi Alonso arrived at Bayern Munich, some were sceptical. Why had Bayern effectively traded a young, homegrown star in Toni Kroos, for an ageing Spaniard in Alonso? A few weeks later, Alonso is already being heralded as a new hero.

The Spanish international has established himself as the new rock at the centre of Bayern's midfield, winning man of the match in his first two appearances for Bayern. In just five Bundesliga games, the former Liverpool man has had 679 touches, and made 558 successful passes, giving him a pass completion rate of 89 per cent.

The high point came on Saturday afternoon in Cologne, where Alonso not only secured Bayern's defensive structure in a somewhat reckless 3-3-4 formation, but also set about breaking as many records as possible.

His 175 completed passes in 90 minutes were more than opponents FC Cologne managed as a whole team. He also had 206 touches of the ball, smashing the previous Bundesliga record, which Spain and Bayern team-mate Thiago had set at 177 last season.

Alonso remained humble after the game, saying “it's nice (to have broken the record), but I'll have to look at the statistics myself. The German press were less reserved, singing Alonso's name from the rooftops.

“Alonso is the new linker and thinker in Bayern's game!” cried Bild. Welt described him as a “phenomenon”, and calculated that the Spaniard had touched the ball around every 26 seconds in the 2-0 win over Cologne.

Given that Alonso only cost Bayern around 6.5 million pounds, Premier League fans may be wondering why the major English clubs did not make more of an effort to sign him. Upon Alonso's arrival, he did admit that he was reluctant to return to England for fear of tainting his Liverpool legacy, and also said that Pep Guardiola had been a huge factor in his decision to go to Bayern.

With only a two year contract, Alonso is seen as a short term solution for Bayern, and the club reportedly chose to sign him rather than Sami Khedira for that reason. In a couple of years, Alonso is expected to make way for the younger midfielders emerging from Bayern's youth set up.

For now, though, the new signing's immediate impact in Bayern's midfield is particularly crucial given their current injury crisis. With Javi Martinez, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Holger Badstuber all out long term, Bayern's options in central defence and defensive midfield have taken a severe hit. Alonso has filled the gap effortlessly.

A major factor in Alonso turning down moves to the Premier League this summer was Pep Guardiola

Worries remain, however, over Alonso's own fitness. The Spaniard is reportedly suffering from long term ankle problems, and apparently only takes part in full training once or twice a week. For the rest of the time, he is limited to light jogging.

Pep Guardiola expressed his concerns about Alonso's fitness earlier in the month, saying: “he can't do everything. We must help him. He can't play every game with this much energy, or he'll be dead in a month”.

That, even in the figurative sense, would be a disaster for Bayern. For while the team struggles to adapt to new tactical innovations and serious injury blows, it is Alonso who is plugging the gaps. It is Alonso driving them to victory. It is Alonso keeping the Bayern ship steady. If he stays fit, the gentleman Spaniard could prove to be the signing of the year.
