Detectives have finally charged a man with the axe murder of a young dental hygienist - almost 40 years to the day after her blood-soaked body was found.

Eileen Ferro was 21 when she was found slashed to death - most likely with a hatchet - in her home in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, in 1974.

Her death sparked a massive police manhunt but, with forensic science still a relatively rudimentary craft, no one was ever brought to justice.

Long-time arm of the law: Lonzo Guthrie (left), 69, of Austell, Georgia, is accused of murdering Eileen Ferro (right) with a hatchet at her home in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, in 1974

tragic: Miss Ferro's husband, Anthony, found the dental hygienist's dead body in the utility room at their home in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, on February 22 1974.

But today, just three weeks before the 40th anniversary of her death, 69-year-old Lonzo Guthrie of Austell, Georgia, appeared in court charged with her murder after detective uncovered DNA evidence that allegedly placed him at the scene.

Tim Connolly, spokesman for Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early, said that DNA evidence linked Guthrie to the slaying of Mrs Ferro.

Connolly said Guthrie is fighting rendition after being arraigned on a fugitive charge in Georgia. He faces a murder charge in Massachusetts. It's not known who is representing him.

Held: Guthrie was held without bond as he fights extradition to Massachusetts to face trial

He was held without bond as he fights extradition to Massachusetts to face trial.

Mrs Ferro's husband, Anthony, found the dental hygienist's dead body in the utility room after returning home from work on February 22 1974.

Officials believed she was slashed repeatedly with a sharp heavy object, possibly a hatchet.

Ferro's sister Nancy Donnelly says her family is elated there's a break in the case. She said her parents died without a resolution and she had feared she might as well.

Guthrie is a registered sex offender stemming from a rape conviction in California, also in 1974. He'd also been arrested for driving with a suspended license.

Most recently, Guthrie, who sometimes used the alias Norman James, occasionally worked in a business called Norman's Road Service Repair, police said.
