Selfies are fuelling a rise in plastic surgery because people are putting their faces under a ‘microscope’ every time they take a picture on their smart phones.

The trend of taking your own portrait means that we are becoming increasingly narcissistic and want to go under the knife to improve our looks, said US surgeons.

The American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery revealed that one third of its 2,700 members reported an increase in procedures last year due to pictures taken on social media.

The selfie taken at the Oscars earlier this month by actor Bradley Cooper featuring celebrities including Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey became the most re-tweeted photo of all time

As a result the organisation’s members saw a 10 per cent rise in nose jobs and a seven per cent increase in hair transplants.

There was also a six per cent increase in eyelid surgery.

Dr Edward Farrior, President of the AAFPRS, said that if you wanted to avoid feeling bad about yourself, it might be time to put your phone down.

He said: ‘Social platforms like Instagram, Snapchat and the iPhone app Selfie.im, which are solely image based, force patients to hold a microscope up to their own image and often look at it with a more self-critical eye than ever before.

‘These images are often the first impressions young people put out there to prospective friends, romantic interests and employers and our patients want to put their best face forward.’

Dr Farrior said that the most popular selfie-inspired operations for women were face lifts, nose jobs and Botox.

Men went for Botox and hair transplants, he added.

The trend was particularly strong among you people and in a worrying twist, last year 58 per cent of plastic surgeons saw a rise in cosmetic surgery among the under-30s.

Selfies hugely popular in the UK and are so ingrained in our culture that the word has been incorporated into the Oxford English Dictionary.

Britons now take 35m selfies a month and more than half of adults have taken one, including 29 per cent of the over 65s.

A selfie taken at the Oscars earlier this month by actor Bradley Cooper featuring celebrities including Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey became the most forwarded message of all time on Twitter.

It was forwarded on more than two million times, causing the social media site to briefly crash.

At the Prince’s Trust Awards Joan Collins tried to imitate the picture with 14 stars including Jeremy Irons and Sir Ben Kingsley but got it out of focus and cropped out some celebrities.
