There is no denying 2013 has been the year of Cara Delevingne.

The fun-loving 20-year-old model landed her debut British Vogue cover, walked in countless shows at fashion week and even posed alongside Romeo Beckham in Burberry's spring/summer13 campaign.

But
while the bushy-browed babe has seen her star rise rapidly (and even 
been dubbed the new Kate Moss), the future wasn't always so bright.

The 5'9" beauty was once-upon-a-time branded a 'dwarf' by famed designer and Louis Vuitton creative director Marc Jacobs.

The long and short of of it: Marc Jacobs, right, branded the model-of-moment, left, a 'dwarf' and refused to cast her in his shows

In fact, the fashion designer actually banned her from appearing in his autumn/winter 2012-13 shows because he thought she was too short and looked odd among his other models.

Speaking in an interview with Sunday Times Style, Katie Grand - who helps Jacobs decide which models to select for the runway - said: 'I was trying to get her [Cara] in the show, but it was the show in which everyone was very tall and very long.

She's made it: After his insult, he recruited Cara to walk in his Paris Fashion Week show last season, left,  alongside Kate Moss, right

'I remember Marc looking at me and saying, "Why is that dwarf in here?", and me being devastated.

'I apologised to her afterwards and made up for it by casting the model in all her key shows and shoots.'

The outgoing model was cast for both Jacobs' eponymous label and Louis Vuitton, for whom he is creative director, back in March, and has now become one of his favourites, because she has 'great energy' and is a good role model for other girls.

Zest for life: The designer has now changed his tune saying that Cara has great energy and is a role model to young women

Speaking recently, he said: 'She's a silly goose. She has a great energy. She turned up to the Vuitton show wearing a zebra outfit from Madagascar, a onesie.

'She'd been traipsing round Paris all evening in it, you got to love a girl like that. It's rare in life that you meet a person who doesn't care. It sets a good example.'

pages of monochrome Gosling in action.

And now it is Cara Delevingne's turn to have people reaching for the Crayola.
