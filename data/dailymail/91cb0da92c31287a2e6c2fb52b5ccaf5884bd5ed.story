A financial adviser who attacked and killed a millionaire socialite after defrauding him of £343,000 to fund a lavish lifestyle has been found guilty of murder.

David Jeffs, 36, splashed out on Lotus sports cars, dined at fine restaurants and stayed at top hotels using his client Roberto Troyan's money.

He also frittered away his client's wealth on holidays to Mauritius, Ibiza and the USA, and blew £19,500 on his stag party at the Spearmint Rhino strip club.

When Mr Troyan, 63, realised hi deception and threatened to 'end his gravy train' Jeffs battered him to death at his Mayfair apartment.

Jeffs had just £5.77 left in his bank account and owed the taxman £200,000 at the time of the killing.

He was convicted today of murder and fraud by abuse of position by a jury of three men and nine women at Croydon Crown Court.

Jeff's wife Sherry Woodward bowed her head and sobbed while Jeffs, dressed in a dark suit with a striped shirt and black tie, showed no trace of emotion.

Jeffs, the son of an ambulance driver, began working for Mr Troyan in 2005. He was taken on shortly after the death of the wealthy man's 52-year-old civil partner Anthony Feldman, who was an architect and interior designer.

Mr Feldman's clients included Princess Michael of Kent and former Conservative minister Jonathan Aitken.

The architect's inheritance had made the victim very wealthy and Jeffs took advantage of his 'frail and vulnerable' client.

Prosecutor Ed Brown told the court that 'As a result he was able to live the high life but all at the expense of the deceased who - when the defendant first met him - was a rich man.'

'He died less rich by hundreds of thousands of pounds thanks to this defendant's dishonesty.

'When the life to which the defendant happily had become accustomed to appeared to suddenly to come to an end, and that there was a real possibility that his callous acts would soon be found out, he killed him'.

Jeffs blew thousands of pounds every month on polo matches, sports cars, and electric guitars.

He spent £15,000 in August 2012 alone on his wedding to teacher Sherry Woodward and on their honeymoon tour of Ibiza, Malta, and Las Vegas.

Jeffs had also been earning £53,000 per year with the Surrey-based firm HFM Columbus, and enjoyed an annual expense account of £8,000.

'Victim': Mr Troyan who had employed David Jeffs as his financial advisor since 2005

Shortly before the killing Jeffs used the victim's money to pay a trip to Center Parcs for him, his son and his wife.

Jeffs claimed that Mr Troyan paid him £1,000 a week - with two years' money in advance - while employed as his 'financial concierge'.

But the reality was Jeffs' bad advice had left Mr Troyan struggling following the Icelandic banking crisis in 2008.

He had advised his client to plough £1.2million in insurance bonds that were then invested into a subsidiary of Kaupthing, Iceland's largest bank, which went bust in October 2008.

The victim, who was one of the first gay men to enter a civil partnership in Britain, was complaining bitterly about Jeffs and may have confronted him about his huge losses before he died.

He was found lying dead in a pool of blood by his maid in the kitchen of his Mayfair flat on March 8.

Mr Troyan had suffered multiple skull fractures, a fractured jaw, cheek and eye-socket and had inhaled blood into his airways.

Murder charge: David Jeffs, 36, battered Roberto Troyan to death in his Mayfair home when his fraud was about to be uncovered, a court heard

Jeffs was seen on CCTV entering Mr 
Troyan’s Mount Street apartment on the afternoon of March 8 and leaving 
some 15 minutes later.

He then left voicemail messages on Mr Troyan’s phone, claiming he was trying to reach him, in a bid to cover his footsteps.

After murdering Mr Troyan, Jeffs travelled to Guildford, Surrey where he bought black bin-bags, wet wipes and a new set of clothes like the ones he was wearing in Mayfair.

He then spent 45 minutes at a service station where he changed in a Starbucks toilet before disposing of his blood-stained garments.

When Jeffs was first interviewed by police, days after the murder, he denied entering Mr Troyan's home and claimed he had only knocked on the front door but got no answer.

After scientists found Mr Troyan's blood on Jeffs's briefcase, he changed his story and told police he was confronted by a mystery man who was covered in blood.

He claimed he had not previously mentioned the man to avoid association with the 'messiness' of Mr Troyan's life and the scrutiny of the Inland Revenue.

'That Robert had paid me, over the course of three years, such a large amount of money and knowing that I had paid not a single penny in tax, it weighed heavily on my mind,' Jeffs said.

'In my mind the man might have been an angry pimp in some sort of bondage session, or into drugs, things like that.

'There was certainly drug-taking and possible activity with rent-boys who had been up to Robert's flat previously.

'There were times when I saw him passed out naked on the floor and debit cards covered in what looked like cocaine'.

He said there were often random men present and evidence of drug-fuelled sex parties when he arrived for meetings.

'I saw a lot of evidence of cocaine-taking and sometimes there would be men I did not know there.

'Leather paddles and pornography was poorly hidden in a wicker basket and I once found Robert completely naked, passed out in his lounge surrounded by sexual paraphernalia.'

Exclusive neighbourhood: Police launched a murder investigation in Mayfair after Mr Troyan was discovered dead. He had been bludgeoned to death

Jeffs, from Nottingham, denied murder and fraud by abuse of position.

He will now be sentenced on 10 December at Southwark Crown Court.

After the conviction, Baljit Ubhey, CPS London Chief Crown Prosecutor, said: 'This was a case of cold and calculated deception which resulted in the violent murder of Roberto Troyan by David Jeffs.

'As Mr Troyan's financial adviser, David Jeffs was able to gain his trust but then quickly began to abuse that relationship to fund his own extravagant and excessive lifestyle.

'Jeffs exploited Mr Troyan's lack of financial knowledge to steal £343,000 which he spent on sports cars, luxury hotels, exotic holidays and hospitality tickets to sporting events.

'When he realised his dishonesty was about to be exposed Jeffs murdered Mr Troyan and created an elaborate web of lies to account for his spending and to cover-up the murder.

'Today he has been brought to justice for his crimes and we hope his conviction will bring some comfort to Mr Troyan's family. Our thoughts are with them at this time.'
