A close family friend has been charged in the brutal slaying of a 5-year-old New York girl whose body was found stuffed in a trash can.

The family of Isabella Tennant called police Monday morning to say she was missing from her great-grandmother's Niagara Falls home, where she'd been staying overnight.

Isabella's great-grandmother said she'd last seen her Sunday night with 16-year-old neighbor and family friend John Freeman.

Tragedy: Isabella Sarah Tennant, five, was found in a garbage can down an alley in the City of Niagara, New York after being missing for around 12 hours

Authorities say 18-year-old Tyler Best went to police Monday and led them to her body, which he said he helped Freeman hide.

Police have charged Freeman as an 
adult. They say Freeman is charged with murder and Best is charged with 
tampering with evidence.

Freeman and Best were in custody and couldn't be reached for comment 
Monday. There was no listed home phone number for them, and no 
information about attorneys was available.

Freeman was described as a 'trusted family friend' and Isabella's great-grandmother said she had last seen her Sunday night with the 16-year-old.

Authorities said it appeared Isabella had been killed without weapons being involved.

Police on Monday said they had charged Freeman as an adult and he faced a murder charge. They said Best was charged with tampering with evidence.

injuries but no indication of sexual abuse.

'It's a terrible crime,' he said. 'It tears at your heart.'

Of Best going to police, Thompson said, 'I imagine it was his conscience.'

The girl who had blue eyes and blonde hair was last seen wearing pink pyjamas with black stars.

Neighbors had combed the area late into the night and police brought in search dogs.

The girl was being cared for by her grandmother while her mother, of Cheektowaga, worked at Player's nightclub in Niagara Falls.
