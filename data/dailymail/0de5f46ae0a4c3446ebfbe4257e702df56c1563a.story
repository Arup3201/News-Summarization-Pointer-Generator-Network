A huge search is on after an elderly man donated more than he intended by accidentally leaving his life savings in a suit he gave to a charity shop.

Charity workers were today hunting through piles of donated clothes at a warehouse in Iowa after the 80-year-old man handed in his suit in Illinois.

A Goodwill store spokesman said the man's wife has cancer and they were going to be using the $13,000 in the suit pocket for her medical expenses.

Where's the money? Charity workers were today hunting through piles of donated clothes at a warehouse in Iowa after the man handed in his suit in Illinois

‘It's his life savings and he's in a difficult situation right now,’ the charity’s vice president of marketing Dana Engelbert said.

She said the grey suit was donated to a store in Moline, Illinois, and could have been sold at the store or sent away with other clothing.

If it was sent away it would have gone to a regional Goodwill warehouse in Iowa City, where non-seasonal items go for storage, Ms Engelbert said.

The man wasn't sure when he made the donation, but workers were checking back through clothes dropped off since the last week of October.

Ms Engelbert said more than 575,000 items have been donated in the past year to the chapter that covers southeast Iowa and western Illinois.

It is not know how many bills were in the suit jacket or the denominations of the cash, but Ms Engelbert said the lumps could easily go unnoticed.

'It's been extremely heartwarming, the number of people reaching out to help. The phone at the Moline store rang almost nonstop with people calling about it, and I've received emails from as far away as Germany'

As word of the man's plight spread, Goodwill has been inundated with calls and emails from people offering assistance.

‘It's been extremely heartwarming, the number of people reaching out to help,’ Ms Engelbert said.

‘The phone at the Moline store rang almost nonstop with people calling about it, and I've received emails from as far away as Germany.’

But the man and his family are declining all offers of financial assistance and have asked that they not be identified, Ms Engelbert said.

The man's daughter said in a statement provided to WQAD-TV in Moline the family is very grateful for everyone who has offered a donation.

'We are overwhelmed by the outpouring of generosity from around the world. My father's wishes are to respectfully decline any donations of any kind. He only wanted someone to come forward with the money he gave away by mistake'

‘We are overwhelmed by the outpouring of generosity from around the world,’ she said.

‘My father's wishes are to respectfully decline any donations of any kind. He only wanted someone to come forward with the money he gave away by mistake.’

The family is offering a $1,000 reward for the return of the money, Ms Engelbert said.

It's not unusual for people to find money in donated clothes and return it to the store, but typically no more than $5, Ms Engelbert said.

‘We do whatever we can to return it to the owner whenever possible,’ she said, adding that unclaimed money usually goes to their operating fund.
