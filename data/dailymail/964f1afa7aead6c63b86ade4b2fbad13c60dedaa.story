The decision for Australia to join air strikes against Islamic State jihadists in Iraq will be made within days, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has said.

On Tuesday the federal government national security committee and cabinet is expected to meet to discuss how to clear any hurdles to Australia's participation in the conflict in Iraq, with the timing of a final decision just a 'question of days'.

This comes as RAAF aircraft set to participate in attacks on the Islamic State have conducted their first training missions in the Middle East region.

 Defence said F/A-18F Super Hornets, an E-7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft and KC-30A airborne refueler all conducted preliminary flights from Australia's Middle East base on Sunday.

That was aimed at familiarising aircrew of the Air Task Group with local conditions and coalition procedures so they can operate in the coalition command and control network.

These missions will continue this week.

The government has yet to give the final go-ahead for air attacks to start. It hasn't said yet whether IS would be targeted in Syria as well as Iraq.

Defence chief Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin said Australia was planning and coordinating operations of the Air Task Group with international partners. 

He said this task group, which comprises six Super Hornets plus the Wedgetail and KC-30A was well-suited to operating with coalition aircraft.

'They will significantly enhance the ability of Iraqi security forces to strike at ISIL terrorist elements,' he said in a statement.

All aircraft in the Air Task Group are conducting their first ever combat deployments.

The Super Hornets can conduct precision strikes against IS ground units and supply lines in support of Iraqi and Kurdish forces.

The Wedgetail, regarded as the most advanced aircraft of its type in the world, can coordinate movement of coalition aircraft in what's likely to be very crowded airspace over the battlefield.

Australia's tanker aircraft will contribute to the air campaign by refueling coalition aircraft, allowing extended missions.

A 200-strong ground force, including special forces, stands ready to advise security forces inside Iraq.
