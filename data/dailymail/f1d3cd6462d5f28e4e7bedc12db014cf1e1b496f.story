Cleveland pair LeBron James and Kyrie Irving were absent as the Cavaliers' winning run was ended in a 93-86 defeat to the Indiana Pacers.

James was nursing a back injury while Irving had hurt his left shoulder and the Cavs missed their star duo as George Hill's first career triple-double inspired the Pacers, who trailed by nine after the first quarter.

Hill contributed 15 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists as Indiana continued their good run of form with a seventh win from nine matches. The Cavs had won 18 from 20 prior to this and had beaten the west-leading Golden State Warriors on Thursday.
