If investigating London’s vast network of sewers doesn’t sound like your idea of a romantic date, how about doing it search of great globules of fat blocking the drains?

As unappealing as that sounds to most of us, one couple celebrated their love under the streets of the capital while on the lookout for ‘fatbergs’.

Dan MacIntyre decided to surprise girlfriend Dunya Kalantery with the excursion to mark their one year anniversary.

Dan MacIntyre and girlfriend Dunya Kalantery share a tender moment during their one-year anniversary celebrations in London's sewer system

The couple discovered their shared interest in greasy globules when a record 15-tonne fatberg was discovered under Kingston last year

The pair first discovered their mutual passion for fatbergs when the notorious 15-tonne, double decker bus-sized fatberg – the biggest ever found in the UK – was found causing chaos in Kingston a year ago.

So Mr MacIntyre secretly wrote to Thames Water with the request to tour the sewers to celebrate their one-year anniversary.

Mr MacIntyre, said: ‘It was incredible to see real-life fatbergs. We're very grateful to Thames Water for arranging this trip. It has been a dream come true - the perfect anniversary present!’

Shocked Dunya, said: ‘It was an amazing experience, the sewer architecture was incredible. It was a fantastic surprise.’

Fatberg is the term used by Thames Water to refer to a congealed lump of fat, which can often contain other items which don't break down, such as nappies, sanitary items and wet wipes

The pair spent a couple of hours with the Thames Water sewer team as they carried out maintenance work in Oxford Street, then went underground for forty minutes before resurfacing among the well-dressed crowds of Oxford Street revellers.

'Fatberg' is the term used by Thames Water to refer to a congealed lump of fat, along with other items which don't break down such as nappies, sanitary items and wet wipes.

These masses collect and block the sewer pipes, causing clogs ortotal blockages. Last year a record 15-tonne fatberg was discovered under Kingston.

The mass caused sewage flow through pipes to be reduced to 5 per cent of normal capacity. The blockage was so critical it threatened to blast untreated sewage through manhole covers onto the streets.

Engineers who found the colossal blockage of congealed fat said they had never seen anything like it.

In the late Nineties, Thames Water spent £2 million a year removing fat from its network - that figure bulged to £12million in 2012.

It's not only disgarded cooking oil which is adding to current fatbergs, a 15 per cent annual rise in wet wipes has also been blamed - a product our Victorian sewers cannot deal with.

Dave Dennis of Thames Water, who organised the bizarre date, said: ‘It was a pleasure to have Dan and Dunya along with us last night to help us ‘fight the fatberg’.

‘While fatbergs are an unusual sight that few people get to see, the real and very unromantic side of it is they cause serious blockages that lead to sewer flooding. So help my sewer team have a happy ending too - and remember the only thing that should go down the loo is toilet paper and human waste.’

However, the man in charge of London’s sewer network, Mike Gunn, was quick to dash the hopes of other couples hoping for a tryst in the bowels of London.

He says he doesn't intend to open his manholes for anyone else.

He added: ‘These two are fatberg crazy, and once we were over the shock of the request we didn’t want to stand in the way of true love. But, we are definitely not tour guides. Our sewers are dangerous and we have a serious job to do to keep them flowing. Sorry, before anybody gets any ideas, this was strictly a one-off.’
