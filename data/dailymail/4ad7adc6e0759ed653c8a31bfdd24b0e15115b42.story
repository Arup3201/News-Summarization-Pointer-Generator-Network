Motorists who need disabled parking spaces are finding it increasingly difficult to find themselves a car park as able-bodied people continue to illegally misuse the spots.

But some relief may be around the corner with one of Australia's state transport ministers  announcing he's considered deducting points from the driver's licences of those who park in disabled spots without a valid permit.

Community and disability groups have welcomed the proposed changes with members taking to social media to show their support.

Badly behaved drivers who park illegally in disabled spots could soon lose demerit points off their licence

The Australian Disability Parking Wall of Shame, which regularly 'shames' drivers parking in disabled spots, is one of the groups which had been pushing for a crackdown.

Pictures that regularly pop up on the page include cars without a permit in them or people parked across a number of disabled spaces.

Often members take to the social media group to voice concerns about confrontations they had with other motorists when they approached them about parking illegally.

The Australian Disability Parking Wall of Shame, who regularly out able-bodied drivers illegally using disabled spots, have supported the move 

 Vehicles taking up more than one space such as this shocking park make regular appearances on the page

Recent features on the page include a crane, skip rubbish bin and a car with a huge trailer and an array of other vehicles parked in disabled spaces, without having a permit. 

Other badly behaved drivers include a red vehicle parked across one and a half disabled parking spaces outside of a bottle shop, and the driver of a blue four-wheel drive who left their car diagonally across two spaces.

On Monday NSW Minister for Roads and Freight Duncan Gay told Daily Mail Australia he is looking at deducting demerit points from drivers if they park in disabled parking spots without a permit.

NSW Minister for Roads and Freight Duncan Gay is set to introduce deductions of demerit points for drivers who illegally use disabled parking spots

Minister Gay described able-bodied drivers who abuse disabled carparks as 'low-lifes' and the misuse of the spots as 'sick behaviour'.

'Able bodied people who steal disabled car parks from people who genuinely need them are lowlifes, plain and simple,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I have utmost sympathy for the people who are disadvantaged by this sick behaviour.'

This move has been welcomed by the Australian Disability Parking Wall of Shame group

People are now calling for the same action to be brought in across Australia, and not just NSW

Mr Gay described those who misuse these parking spots as 'love-lifes'

'I’ve asked Roads and Maritime Services to look at introducing demerit point penalties for people caught parking illegally in disabled car parks.

'Just because you can afford to pay a fine doesn't give you the right to disadvantage the needs of disabled people in our community,' Minister Gay added.

The Daily Telegraph reported that able-bodied motorists could face fines of up to $623 for the misuse of a permit.

Other drivers could be forking out $519 if they're caught out parking in a disabled spot without an official mobility parking scheme permit.
