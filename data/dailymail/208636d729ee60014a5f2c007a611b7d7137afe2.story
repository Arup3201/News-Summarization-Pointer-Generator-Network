In an age where going to the gym is akin to strutting down the catwalk (thanks, Miranda Kerr), fitness brands are cashing in on us working out.

One company who are dominating the market in America and count Kim Kardashian, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Cameron Diaz as fans has just landed in the UK in the hope of giving British fitness fanatics a high fashion makeover.

lululemon, a Canadian-born company, last night celebrated the opening of its first European shop - a 3,100 square foot yoga emporium in Covent Garden and the great and THE glamorous turned out to celebrate in style.

Looking good: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a huge fan of lululemon and is always seen wearing their creations during her work-out

lululemon, which sold £210m worth of apparel in 113 stores in 2008 and is now worth a staggering £4.3bn, is worn by 25 per cent of people in London's yoga classes.

Headed up by the president of TOMS Shoes, Laurent Potdevin, lululemon has developed a cult-like following. 

Founded in Vancouver in 1998 under the official name of lululemon athletica the company describes itself as a yoga-inspired athletic apparel company.

The launch comes after the success of showrooms in Chelsea, Islington, Richmond and Covent Garden; which are open a few days a week and allow customers to purchase products and partake in complimentary yoga classes, which have become somewhat a ritual amongst the cool fitness crowds of London.

Debut store: The lululemon store officially opened in Covent Garden last night and will host yoga workshops while selling its famous clothing

The store will offer a range of apparel for yoga and running for both men and women, and famous fans such as Donna Air and Bip Ling turned out to view the latest collection last night.

The brand claim to utilise special technical fabrics designed to handle serious stretch and sweat.

The yoga wear chain even launched a leather leggings collection on its U.S. website, designed to be as comfortable in the gym as it is chic in the office or a cocktail bar.

Stylish: The designs are pretty pricey. This Lightened Up Pullover (left) is £118, while the Patience Pant is £88

Tote talk: Kylie Jenner is a fan of lulemon and was recently seen carrying her purchases in one of their iconic eco-friendly and enlightening bags

On top of all its fashion offerings, the UK store will also host events for 
customers ranging from self-defence to goal-setting workshops to 
complimentary yoga classes led by community ambassadors.

Speaking about the brand, spinning instructor and fashion stylist Pippa Vosper, said: 'Never before have I found a sports brand that I can feel great in while teaching my spin class and also wearing for brunch at the weekend with friends.

'My main role is that of a fashion brand consultant and lululemon is being placed in the same category as Alexander Wang, Stella McCartney and Helmut Lang when discussing fashion focused activewear that is acceptable to wear outside of the gym.

We work out: lululemon hosted a 400 person yoga class at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden to celebrate their first London store opening

Fashion meets function: Lululemon's new &go 
collection, only available in the US, comprises leather-look shorts (£32.50, left, actually made from 
stretchy, durable Warpstreme) and leggings with flattering leather-look 
panels (£71, right)

Work-out to brunch: Pippa and Alexandra showcase how the kit can be worn to work-out in, as well as stylish daytime apparel (right)

'lululemon's cuts are flattering, the fabric is of superior quality and the UK is about to discover just why every girl in every state of America has Lululemon in their wardrobes.'

Can't afford the £80 leggings? Take away some free advice from the brand's website which states: 'dance, sing, floss and travel, sweat once a day and visualise your eventual demise. It can have an amazing effect on how you live in this moment'.

Namaste.
