A high school graduate tired of having his car seats soaked after a day at the beach has created swimming shorts that stay dry - even while in the water.

Frank Shaw, from Toronto, Canada, is funding his Frank Anthony swimwear line through Kickstarter, and after 15 days he has already surpassed his $10,000 goal to raise $45,000.

'We wanted to create a garment that could
 transition from a day at the beach, to a workout at the gym and a night
 on the town all without having to change,' the 19-year-old told MailOnline.

A high school graduate tired of having his car seats soaked after a day at the beach has created swimming shorts that stay dry - even while in the water

The swimming trunks, which range in price from $43 to $62, are made in Italy using Hydrophobic Nanotechnology fabric - a polyester blend that prevents all water-based substances from absorption -  which is manufactured and produced in Switzerland.

'When the garment is underwater the 
fabric creates an air surface around the shorts preventing water from 
seeping through the nanoscale whiskers,' explained Mr Shaw, who wouldn't disclose which Swiss company produces the fabric, but claims that the swim trunks dry 95per cent faster 
than any other swim shorts on the market.

If his Kickstarter campaign reaches $55,000, Mr Shaw will also release a women's line of swimwear made from the same material.

'We want to create a 
unique garment which will allow women to feel comfortable in our shorts,
 whether they choose to wear them while swimming or over-top of their wet
 bikini,' he said.

Mr Shaw first got the idea, which took 
just nine months to conceive, after finally losing patience with having 
to dry his swim shorts after use.

But the first prototype, he said, was a flop.

'We spent all this money to get the top of the line Nanotechnology coating imported from Colorado to Toronto - the spray was used for Industrial applications, and is terribly unsafe,' he admitted.

'We thought we were going to create these awesome shorts that never would get wet because of the coating! Boy were we wrong, the shorts wouldn't even go over my waist due to how stiff the coating made them.

'The shorts went from a navy blue to a white because of the coating and the smell was cancerous.'

Mr Shaw scraped the idea of Nanotechnology coating and instead decided to investigate Nanotechnology fabric.

'Our current provider created a unique blend which has been tested and perfected for swimwear,' said Mr Shaw.

While there have been plenty of water-repelling swim shorts created before him, by American-made retailers such as Outlier and Flint and Tinder (which both use Nanosphere treatment on its fabrics), Mr Shaw says his inbuilt Hydrophobic Nanotechnology makes Frank Anthony shorts 'revolutionary'.

'Water repelling technology has been out for quite some time now and offers surface spill protection, but the technology completely loses all forms of productivity when over encumbered with liquid due to it's surface coating characteristics,' said Mr Shaw.

'We also noticed that a lot of surface coatings which provide water repelling characteristics often fade over time. Due to the characteristics of our fabric, the Hydrophobic Nanotechnology will last as long as the stitching on the garment.'
