Conor McColl, 16, drowned in a disused quarry in Clophill, Bedfordshire, after swimming over to meet girls on the other bank, after earlier smoking cannabis, and inquest has ruled

A teenage boy drowned in a water-filled quarry after swimming over to meet girls on the other bank after earlier smoking cannabis with friends, an inquest heard today.

Conor McColl and his friends had seen videos of the disused quarry in Clophill, Bedfordshire, on social media and decided to visit it because there was an island in the middle you could leap from into the water.

A post mortem confirmed that Conor had drowned and revealed the 16-year-old, of Broadway, in Jaywick, Clacton-on-Sea, had been smoking cannabis at the quarry before his death in July last year.  

When Conor and his three friends arrived they found another eight teenagers already there, swimming and socialising, the inquest heard. After a couple of girls swam across the lake Conor and two of his friends followed them.

Detective Sergeant Albert Freer read out statements from Conor's friends, Vaidas Nartautas, 16, Thomas Robertson, 21, and Reece Campbell, 17, at the inquest. 

The detective said that Vaidas had told him that when he reached the other side he spotted his friend, Conor, struggling in the water.

Det Sgt Freer said: 'He was still in deep water when they both heard Conor start to struggle, saying he couldn't breathe and splash in the water.

'Vaidas swam out and tried to hold Conor up in the water but Conor started to struggle and was pulling him down.

'Vaidas lost all his strength. As Conor went down for the last time he gripped Vaidas' leg. Vaidas thought he was going to drown.'

Vaidas tried to help Conor, the inquest heard, but his friend dropped below the surface and disappeared, sparking a frantic search by emergency services.

Police divers from Nottingham later pulled Conor's body from the tangled weeds five metres beneath the surface in the gravel pit in Jaques Lane.

The inquest heard that Conor's friends and made 'heroic efforts' to try and save him before he went under

Det. Sgt. Freer told the inquest that the lock on the quarry's gate had been forced but said there was no evidence it had been broken by Conor and his friends.

He said the quarry featured warning signs and was fenced off. 

Recording a verdict of misadventure, senior coroner for Bedfordshire and Luton Tom Osborne, described Conor's death as a tragic accident and said he hoped it would stop other youngsters from swimming in disused quarries. 

He said: 'He embarked upon the innocent past time of going swimming but it went horribly wrong.

'Conor entered the water and got into difficulty and depsite the heroic efforts of his friends to try to save him, he went under the water.

'It is particularly tragic. What seemed a frivilous past-time of going swimming in these lakes ended up in his tragic death.'

Mr Osborne said the deaths of youngsters in deep water were an all-too-common occurance and warned of the dangers of going swimming in freezing cold lakes, even in summer.

'Even in the height of summer these pools remain extremely cold. They should be avoided at all costs,' he said.

'It's a highly dangerous past-time.'

'The message that should go out from this inquest is do not go swimming in cold water, even in the middle of summer.'
