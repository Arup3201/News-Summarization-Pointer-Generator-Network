Here Ron is pictured celebrating his fifth wedding anniversary to his eighth wife, Weng, who is 30 years his junior

When it comes to tying the knot, Ron Sheppard is in illustrious company.

He
 is on his eighth marriage...two more than Henry VIII managed, the same 
number as Elizabeth Taylor and just one fewer than Zsa Zsa Gabor.

But Britain’s most married man insists his eighth wife will be his last.

After all, the union with Weng Platino has already lasted nine years.

Mr
 Sheppard, 65, says that in 35-year-old Weng, from the Philippines, he 
has finally found his true love and soulmate after searching for more 
than 47 years.

He was 19 when he wed his first wife, Margaret, in 1966.

The marriage lasted two years and he went on to marry Jeanette, Lesley, Kathy, Sue, Usha and Wan.

The
 retired holiday camp entertainer, who once mentored Shane Richie, said:
 ‘I have had eight mothers-in-law so I must be brave.’

Mr
 Sheppard, who has eight children, 13 grandchildren and four 
great-grandchildren, has now written a book on his life, which he has 
called Lord Of The Wedding Rings.

He says he always believed marriage was for life but never felt ‘true love’ in his first seven marriage.

‘I
 genuinely believe there is the right person for everyone out there,’ 
said Mr Sheppard, of Martock, Somerset. ‘Unfortunately for me, it took 
me longer than most to find the right one.

‘When
 I first married I was very young and naive. With some of the marriages,
 I just didn’t have the heart to say no and it seemed to be the decent 
thing to marry.

‘Weng has changed me inside out. Every day with her is like a honeymoon.’

He met her online shortly after separating from seventh wife Wan, who was from Thailand, in 2003.

He flew to the Philippines to meet Weng and they instantly fell for each other, marrying on the Isle of Wight in November 2004.

Mr Sheppard is in talks with production companies about turning his book, which is published on February 1, into a film.

However, he is setting his sights rather high, perhaps, when it comes to casting the leading man.

‘I think it would be fitting for Jude Law to play me, as he is very good,’ Mr Sheppard said.
