An anniversary appeal for information on the murder of Stephen Lawrence has prompted two 'very significant' phone calls, police said today.

The appeal was broadcast on the BBC's Crimewatch programme last night, a week after the 20th anniversary of the racist attack in Eltham, South-East London.

Officers are now following up a number of phone calls received after the programme.

Victim: Stephen Lawrence was murdered 20 years ago and a special BBC1 Crimewatch appeal broadcast yesterday sought new information on the case

Distinctive: A man in a green jacket was seen opposite the Coronet cinema near the scene of the murder wearing a green jacket with a large 'V'

Detective Chief Inspector Clive Driscoll said they had many calls last night, but two in particular were 'very significant'.

'One could produce a potential 
eyewitness to the attack, and one gives very good background information
about suspects already known,' he said.

'In addition to that we have also had
three phone calls about the green jumper or jacket and we will 
certainly be making inquiries around those bits of information to verify
them.'

Mr Lawrence, an 18-year-old aspiring 
architect, was stabbed to death by a group of up to six white youths in 
an unprovoked racist attack as he waited at a bus stop in Well Hall Road
with a friend on the evening of April 22 1993.

In January 2012 Gary Dobson and David
Norris were found guilty of being involved in the attack and sentenced 
to life imprisonment, after a forensic review of the case found 
significant new scientific evidence on clothing seized from their homes 
following the murder.

Gary Dobson, left, and David Norris were convicted of Stephen's killing in January last year. Dobson dropped his appeal last month while Norris continues to fight against his conviction

But police have said that, despite 
securing two convictions, the investigation remains open and officers 
believe there were people in the area of the murder who have never come 
forward.

These include two men who got off a 
bus at the stop opposite where Mr Lawrence was attacked and walked 
southbound along the east side of Well Hall Road; a man who ran from the
area of Well Hall Road roundabout to the bus stop on the same side of 
Well Hall Road as the attack; a man who was walking on the east side of 
Well Hall south of the roundabout, opposite the Coronet cinema, wearing a
distinctive green jacket with a large 'V'; and anyone else in the 
general vicinity, such as those outside the cinema and on passing buses.

Mr Driscoll said previously: 
'Although two individuals are serving a life sentence in connection with
this murder, we have always known there were other people involved in 
the attack. As such this investigation remains open and my team is 
committed to pursuing all viable lines of inquiry available to us. It is
hoped this appeal will assist with our inquiries.

'We believe there were people in the 
area that night who may have seen something - not the murder itself 
necessarily, but events or individuals leading up to the event.

'I am taking this opportunity to 
appeal directly to those people to come forward and speak to us. You may
think you won't remember something from so long ago, but we would still
implore you to come forward.'
