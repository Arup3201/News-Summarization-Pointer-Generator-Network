War Horse author Michael Morpurgo is in the running for a prestigious literary prize with his latest book - also set in the First World War.

Morpurgo, the author of more than 100 books, is one of 20 writers competing for the £30,000 Costa Book of the Year.

His novel, Listen To The Moon, is set in 1915 and is the story of a mysterious girl whose appearance on an isolated island sparks rumours of German spies and U-boat raids.

The Costa awards are divided into five categories: first novel, novel, biography, poetry and children's book, with the section winners eligible for book of the year which is announced on January 27.

Morpurgo's story is on the children's shortlist with another World War One tale, Five Children On The Western Front, by Kate Saunders.

Two writers, Ali Smith and Neel Mukherjee, who lost out on the Booker Prize last month, are among the shortlist for the novel prize.

Other contenders for the prize, drawn from 640 entries, include brain surgeon Henry Marsh's memoir Do No Harm and Chop Chop, a debut novel set in a pub kitchen, written by former chef Simon Wroe.

Costa managing director Christopher Rogers said: "What a fantastic selection of books. If people are looking for recommendations of what books to buy for Christmas this year, then they're all here. This list really demonstrates what a great year it's been for books - I can't wait to sit down and read them."

Last year's winner, The Shock Of The Fall by debut novelist Nathan Filer, has gone on to sell more than 300,000 copies.
