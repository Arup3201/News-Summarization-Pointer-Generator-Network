A love-struck graphic designer has been cleared of trying to kill her mother by poisoning her after she forbade her from marrying her boyfriend. 

Inspired by a storyline in Breaking Bad, Kuntal Patel, 37, was accused of slipping her 'controlling and selfish' mother Meena a ricin-like toxin.

It was alleged that Patel developed a murder plot after becoming 'addicted' to the American TV series and watching an episode in which drug lord Walter White kills an enemy with ricin-laced tea.

But while Patel, a volunteer at the London Olympics, admitted fantasising about killing her magistrate mother, who the court heard was 'hell-bent' on breaking up her engagement and bullied and beat her, she denied ever intending to kill her.  

'Plot': Kuntal Patel, 37, (left), from east London, has been cleared of trying to kill her mother Meena Patel, 60, (right) by lacing her Diet Coke with a deadly poison in a Breaking Bad-style plot

Jurors at Southwark Crown Court heard from prosecutors that Patel (pictured in a court sketch) fantasised about being Walter White, the main character in Breaking Bad, or a Mexican warlord

She told jurors that she became suicidal and scoured the 'dark web' looking for poisons.

She admitted trying to buy the deadly toxin abrin from American Jesse Korff, telling him she needed a 'tasteless' toxin to get her mother 'out of the way'.

The jury of six men and six women, which had deliberated for just over three hours, cleared her of attempted murder, but convicted of acquiring a biological agent or toxin.

She had previously pleaded guilty to two counts of attempting to acquire a biological agent or toxin.

But she said emails sent to her dealer claiming she had poisoned her mother were a 'fabrication' 

She showed little emotion as the verdict was given. She was remanded back into custody and will be sentenced on November 7. 

The Barclays Bank graphic designer said the comments were part of a wild fantasy world in which she imagined herself as Walter White or a 'Mexican drug warlord'.

She wept in the witness box as she insisted she never actually poisoned her mother.

She told jurors: 'By this time, because of the messages I received from my mum, and because I couldn't cope with it and I wanted to escape from it all, I started to fantasise about trying to kill myself or my mum.

'It was as if I was thinking through it as if I was in my own TV programme or a character in Breaking Bad. I was in a really strange place in my mind.'

She added: 'But I was living this other life. This was my own way of coping - it was my coping mechanism. It was how I survived daily.'

Patel also told the court how she had to ‘respect and obey’ her mother, who was described by the prosecution as ‘manipulative, controlling and selfish’

Asked if she, as ‘an adult woman’, she found her domestic situation normal, Patel replied: ‘I think it was the way I was brought up’.

The two-week trial heard that Patel, who was brought up a strict Hindu Gujarati, had never had a boyfriend or a Valentine's Day card, and was desperate to settle down and have children.

She struck up a relationship with Niraj Kakad, who lived in Phoenix, Arizona, on the Asian dating website Shaadi.com and the pair got engaged on Thanksgiving in November 2012.

But she said her mother was 'hell-bent' on breaking up her relationship, and is said to have locked Patel in their home, and beaten and bullied her in a bid to get her to stop seeing Mr Kakad.

The court heard how the wedding venue became a constant bone of contention and Mr Kakad felt Meena was suffocating his wife-to-be.

He once told the mother she was ‘a low-level magistrate dealing with low-level crimes’.

On another occasion, Meena rang Mr Kakad the early hours of the morning, crying and demanding to know if he really loved her daughter.

Niraj Kakad, 36, was born in London but moved to Arizona as a child.

Of Gujarati heritage, he has a successful, high-earning career in IT but had been unlucky in love and was desperate to get married.

He and Kuntal Patel fell deeply in love and quickly agreed to marry after meeting online, but their ‘on/off on/off’ engagement quickly hit the rocks.

The court heard how Mr Kakad could not cope with Meena Patel’s incessant interference in his relationship, grossly offending her when he accused her of ‘controlling’ behaviour.

When Kuntal told her mother what Mr Kakad had said this, she is said to have slapped her daughter repeatedly.

The family were also shocked when he reported that UK-based friends had warned him off ‘East London girls’.

He has since cut off all contact with Kuntal Patel and is planning to sell the Tiffany jewellery he bought for his wife-to-be.

Kuntal travelled to America to see Mr Kakad twice during their ‘on/off on/off’ relationship, and the Patel’s hosted him in once in London.

Their relationship buckled under the pressure, and they broke up.

Driven to despair, Patel told how she slumped into a depression and began searching ways of killing herself on the internet.

In a series of increasingly desperate emails and texts, she confided in her friend about the 'relentless' abuse and violence she allegedly suffered at the hands of her mother, who sits on the bench at Thames Magistrates' Court.

In one message in August 2012, she said: 'My life is so messed up right now, I actually wish I was dead or wish my mum died. I hate her so much.' 

Asked why she focused on Ricin, she replied: ‘It was from the internet and partly due to the programme Breaking Bad.’

Patel became ‘addicted’ to the programme and watched an episode every day until she completed the series, the court heard.

Simultaneously, she was Googling ‘How to murder somebody and get away with it’ and ‘hit man’, while researching the poisons Ricin, Abrin and Arsenic.

Patel, of Plaistow in east London, admitted paying Korff, who used the internet name 'Snowman', £950 in the virtual currency bitcoins for abrin.

The poison was allegedly hidden in a red wax candle and delivered to London, but Patel said she 'panicked' when she picked the package up and threw it away.

Patel was arrested after the FBI and Homeland Security tipped off the Metropolitan Police that abrin had been shipped to an address in London.

A spokesman from Scotland Yard said: 'The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) contacted the Metropolitan Police Service with information that abrin had been shipped to a London address.

'On Saturday, January 25, officers executed a search warrant at a residential address in Stratford and arrested Patel on suspicion of an offence under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. 

Role: Meena Patel is a  magistrate at Thames Magistrates' Court in Bow, east London

'Detectives from SO15 Counter Terrorism Command were able to uncover and decrypt web-based conversations between Patel and the abrin supplier in the US.'

Before her trial Patel had pleaded guilty to two counts of attempting to acquire a biological agent or toxin, contrary to section 1(1) of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981.

The spokesman added: 'On August 12 Jesse William Korff, 19, of LaBelle, Florida, pleaded guilty before US District Judge Peter G. Sheridan in Trenton federal court to five counts of developing, producing, transferring and possessing toxins, five counts of smuggling toxins and one count of conspiring to kill a person in a foreign country.

'He is due to be sentenced in November.'

Duncan Ball of Counter Terrorism Command said: 'Our thorough and complex investigation identified that Kuntal Patel had purchased an extremely deadly toxin via the dark web.

'I would like to pass on my personal thanks to US law enforcement and other international agencies for their co-operation and assistance during this investigation.'
