Charles Clarke has poured cold water on Ed Miliband's chances at the next election - saying he has failed to show how he will control spending

Ed Miliband is a worse Labour leader than Neil Kinnock and will lose next year’s General Election, a former Labour Home Secretary warned last night.

Charles Clarke, a senior Cabinet minister under Tony Blair, said the party had spent too much money while in office – and Mr Miliband had failed to show how he would control spending if elected.

Mr Clarke said the Labour leader had ‘no narrative’ and had set out an ‘assembly of odd policies’ which were failing to appeal to voters.

And he said Labour would be doing better in the polls if Ed Balls was replaced by Alistair Darling.  The Tories seized on the comments, saying they showed Labour would ‘send us straight back into economic meltdown.’

Mr Clarke, a leading Blairite minister, entered academia after losing his Norwich South seat in 2010 to the Liberal Democrats.

His comments are the latest blow to Mr Miliband, who has seen his abysmal personal poll ratings slide in recent months, amid a string of PR disasters.

The negative comparison with Lord Kinnock is particularly toxic – as the Welsh former Labour leader lost two consecutive elections in 1987 and 1992.

In an interview with the Huffington Post, Mr Clarke said of Lord Kinnock: ‘Neil has far, far more qualities than Ed Miliband as a leader. Neil was a fantastic leader and brought Labour back towards victory.’

Mr Clarke said the ‘most likely outcome’ of next year’s election was a victory for David Cameron’s Conservatives.

And, asked whether Labour could convince voters of its economic credibility in time for the May 7 poll, he replied: ‘I don’t completely exclude it but I think it’s unlikely.’

Asked if Mr Miliband passes the test with voters that they could imagine him at 10 Downing Street, he said: ‘He does actually. I think he has a problem with the population, undoubtedly.. he is an intelligent man, he’d be a good prime minister. I don’t myself think he’s geeky.’

Mr Clarke served in Tony Blair’s government from 1998 to 2006 but resigned as Home Secretary following the foreign prisoners scandal.

He said that Labour under Mr Miliband was ‘not remotely near’ providing the necessary narrative of where it felt it succeeded or failed in Government.

Mr Clarke said Mr Miliband needed to set out a clear statement of what Labour would actually do in power

He said that critics were right to say Labour spent too much while in power, accusing Gordon Brown of overspending ‘not very, very dramatically but significantly’ between 2006 and 2008.

He said Mr Miliband now needs to ‘set out a clear statement of what Labour would actually do - give people a reason to vote Labour, not an assembly of odd policies like the electricity (price) freeze or whatever’.

Mr Clarke said Tony Blair’s money-making activities since leaving Government had ‘damaged his reputation’. But he claimed Mr Blair would have ‘every chance’ of being chosen leader and elected prime minister if he was still a Labour MP.

Asked whether former chancellor Alistair Darling would do a better job than Mr Balls as shadow chancellor, Mr Clarke stressed he was ‘not calling for Ed Balls to go.

But he added: ‘I don’t think Alistair wants to do it [but] definitely I think it would be better for Labour if Alistair was there rather than Ed Balls.’

A poll last month found that 51 per cent think Mr Miliband is a weak leader, 56 per cent think he is out of touch with ordinary people, and 60 per cent think he would not be up to the job of leading the country.

Two weeks ago, former London mayor Ken Livingstone said Mr Miliband was ‘like me’, adding: ‘People have always thought I’m weird.’

Tory MP Nigel Adams said: ‘Charles Clarke admits what Ed Balls can’t: under Labour spending ran out of control, leaving us with the biggest deficit in our peacetime history.

‘Just like then, Labour are incapable of taking the difficult decisions required to secure a better future for Britain.

‘Nothing’s changed. Labour’s plans for more spending, more borrowing and more taxes would send us straight back into economic meltdown.’
