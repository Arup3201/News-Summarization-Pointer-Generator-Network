To most people, it will sound like a barking mad idea.

But inventors have come up with a new range of premium teabags – for dogs.

The brew costs 35p a bag – about ten times the price of PG Tips – and is a mixture of herbs, vitamins and minerals which, it is claimed, will help dogs live a ‘happy and healthy life’.

The tea is the brainchild of Steven Bennett, who has run a website listing dog-friendly pubs and beaches, and tea expert Tony Kinch. The pair pooled their expertise to set up Woof & Brew, which will start selling the tea in shops this week.

The drink, which contains no real tea, was launched at the Crufts dog show in March and hundreds of orders have already been placed on the firm’s website.

‘People loved the idea of being able to sit down and have a cup of tea while their dogs had one as well,’ explained Mr Bennett, 47. ‘We’ve already sold out of our initial stock so we are making additional bags.

‘We’ve even had a couple of dog-friendly teashops and hotels that are interested in serving it alongside their normal teas.’

Mr Bennett and Mr Kinch worked together with holistic vet Richard Allport, who carried out research into the medical benefits of certain herbs, to create the five blends of canine tea – ‘Adult’, ‘Senior’, ‘Skin & Coat’, ‘Performance’ and ‘Breath’. Ingredients include dill, dandelion, ginseng and seaweed.

To brew the tea, owners are told to infuse the bag for four minutes in hot water, before adding cold water to cool the cuppa to suit canine tongues.

Costing £9.99 for a pack of 28, the teabags might seem expensive, but each makes a litre of tea which can be stored in the fridge for a week.

Mr Bennett said the company was adding two new blends, including ‘Posh Pooch’, which he described as ‘the Earl Grey tea for dogs’.

Mr Allport, who tested the tea to ensure it was safe for canines, said: ‘They can really work to enhance their health. They’ve even got the seal of approval from my own dogs.’
