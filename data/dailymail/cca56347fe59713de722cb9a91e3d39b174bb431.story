So much golf history has been written at Royal Liverpool it seems only appropriate that a landmark day for the European game has now moved firmly into view.

If Rory McIlroy can keep mind and sinew together in the final round of the 143rd Open Championship, he will become the first player from this continent to win three different majors since the Masters was founded in 1934.

Even the greats like Sir Nick Faldo and Seve Ballesteros only won two of the four, so to add the Claret Jug to the US Open he won in 2011 and the USPGA Championship the following year would be truly impressive. He would then have the chance to complete the career Grand Slam - something only five golfers have achieved - at the Masters next year at the age of just 25.

Majestic: Rory McIlroy saved the best for last with an eagle on the 18th which opened six-shot lead

'That would create a little hype going into Augusta next year, wouldn't it?' said McIlroy, smiling. 'That would put me in really illustrious company. But I'm taking nothing for granted. I came from seven back myself with a round to go to win the PGA at Wentworth this year, so I know it can be done, and I cannot afford to get ahead of myself.'

Just like Tiger Woods before him, McIlroy is so good that when he plays his best, the rest are playing for second place. It was here in 2006 that Woods underlined that point and now McIlroy has the chance to put the finishing touches to what has been a 54-hole masterclass in all aspects of his craft.

The fact it has been delivered on a links course only adds to the achievement. Remember Rory's frustrated words after being blown away at Royal St George's in 2011, or being demoralised at Muirfield last year?

The previous best McIlroy had ever managed going into the final round of an Open was nine shots behind. Here, after adding a 68 to his two opening rounds of 66, he will begin with a mammoth six-stroke advantage.

The Northern Irishman has shown emphatically what he has learned regarding this form of the game, and while he undoubtedly got lucky with the draw over the first two rounds, you still have to possess the shots to be able to take advantage.

Mental strength never used to be one of his best qualities but the manner in which he lengthened his stride over the closing holes, after Rickie Fowler had caught him at one point, was positively Woods-like. 

Indeed, Tiger comparisons abound, and there's no greater compliment than that. Only two men have won three majors at a younger age than Rory since the Masters was founded in 1934, and they just happen to be Tiger and Jack. Only Tiger has ever won three majors by seven shots or more but, having won his first two by eight, that's certainly within McIlroy's compass.

Like all the great ones he saved the best for last, and a towering drive and five-iron to the par-five 18th that finished just 11 feet from the hole. That second shot from 237 yards was as pure a golf shot as you will ever see and when he duly rolled in the putt, it meant he had played the last five holes in the following: birdie-par-eagle-bogey-eagle. He is now 11 under for the par fives alone.

Contender: American Rickie Fowler is six shots adrift of McIlroy

Weather warning: Electrical storms were forecast for Saturday afternoon but they never materialised

He's not quite home and dry yet, as he said. Greg Norman once lost a six-shot final-round lead at the Masters and Rory lost one of four strokes there himself. Fowler began six in arrears yesterday and caught him after 13 holes. So he will have plenty of reference points today to remind him that the job is not done.   

All the thousands of brave souls who donned their waterproofs and ignored the terrible weather forecast were regally rewarded, for this was a fantastic day's play. Thankfully, the bad stuff stayed away until just after the final putt dropped and a scoring festival broke out. 

The nightmare scenario when you're owning a four-stroke halfway lead is a rain-sodden links, no wind, and a host of aggressive shotmakers in the rear-view mirror.

For a while it was Sergio Garcia and Dustin Johnson who took dead aim to make inroads into McIlroy's lead. Then came a foe who threatened to become a familiar one when he defeated McIlroy for the Quail Hollow Championship three years ago with a birdie at the first play-off hole to claim his maiden PGA Tour title. Fowler disappeared thereafter but a rebuilt swing under the wise tutelage of Butch Harmon looks to be paying dividends.

The putter, though, remains his most potent weapon, and he wielded it to such deadly effect he achieved parity with McIlroy at the 13th.

Hats off: Could Sergio Garcia mount a challenge on the final day at Hoylake?

Struggle: Woods, the 14-time major champion shot a 73 to sit three over and in 58th place

The problem with gunslingers, however, is they're prone to shoot themselves in the foot. Johnson did it with three successive bogeys to close the front nine. Garcia missed a tiddler that stalled his momentum. As for Fowler, having climbed level with McIlroy, he promptly bogeyed three of his next four holes.

McIlroy began tentatively with a bogey from the middle of the first fairway, but this is where experi-ence kicks in. He would have known that after two wonderful 66s it was almost inevitable things wouldn't go quite so smoothly for a third successive day.

'Even when Rickie drew level I remained comfortable,' he said. 'I knew I had to be patient and there were some holes coming up where I could take advantage.' Everything changed as Fowler's rough patch coincided with inspired golf from McIlroy. It was a 30-foot birdie putt at the 14th, one of the tough par fours on the back nine, that got him going. At the 16th there was a three-shot swing, as McIlroy found the green in two and rolled in another long one, while Fowler was running up an untidy bogey.

As he came down the 18th the 7,000 spectators sitting in the first wraparound stand in Open history rose to acclaim Europe's history man (Scottish-born Tommy Armour won three different majors in 1927-31, but had become an American citizen when he won them). 'I wanted to give them something to cheer, because it's a pleasure to play in front of people who are giving you so much support,' he said, and he delivered.

And so one of the great achievements in the annals of the European game has moved within touching distance.

On the banks of the Dee estuary, on an afternoon of promised sunshine, it looks like we're about to see thrilling confirmation that McIlroy is fit to rank alongside any contemporary you care to mention as the leading sportsman of his time.
