'This facial was chosen specifically to lift, firm, tone and illuminate Millie’s skin for her big day. 

'She enjoyed a totally unique healing massage treatment, using a warm essential oil blend devised especially for Millie, to help combat any stress or last minute nerves and to ensure she has a good night’s sleep.

'Crystals are used during the massage to assist in balancing certain energy centres of the body, and to cleanse the aura,' Elizabeth Caroline told MailOnline.

Wedding gift: Elizabeth designed these personalised facial products for Millie, who will be taking them on her honeymoon

Speaking ahead of the wedding, Elizabeth said: 'On the lead up to the wedding we have been concentrating on boosting her energy levels, and calming her nerves with healing, and with her skin we have been focussing on hydration, illumination and controlling any last minute break outs. She naturally has great skin and a good diet.'

Writing on her Yahoo! Lifestyle blog, Millie said: On top of my skin care routine, I've been visiting facialist Elizabeth Caroline to get my skin looking the best it can for my big day.

'Elizabeth's facials are different to any other I've tried; it's a holistic healing approach using a combination of Reiki and Elizabeth's own elemental healing techniques, she studied for 13 years with a buddhist/shamanic healer.

'With Elizabeth she can "see" my own personal energy field or aura, which helps her adapt the treatment even more to my needs.

'The first time I had a treatment from Elizabeth it was the day before my first BAFTAs and I was very anxious...I left the spa a totally different person!'

Elizabeth also designed a personalised set of treatments for Millie.

'I went for silver lids as she had told me she thought silver was very "wedding". She loved the Peace Serum and said she wanted to take them on her honeymoon,' Elizabeth added.
