A South African couple rowed into the record books on Friday after becoming the first team to cross the Atlantic from Africa to the U.S.

It took Riaan Manser and his girlfriend Vasti Geldenhuys 153-days to make the journey in their custom-built 23ft row boat.

The couple celebrated their accomplishment with a kiss as they passed the Statue of Liberty, after enduring a 6,500-mile journey with no support crew and limited supplies.

Record: The South African couple became the first crew to ever row cross the Atlantic from mainland Africa to mainland North America

Manser and Geldenhuys, who started their journey on December 30, estimate that it took 3.6 million rows for them to make it to New York City.

They carried only essentials on board, and kept themselves fed and watered by fishing and using a salt-water convertor.

A GPS system helped them - and their friends and family - keep track of their progress as they crossed the Atlantic, and made their way up from the Bahamas and Miami, to New York.

When they reached Manhattan the couple became the first crew to have rowed from mainland Africa to the mainland of North America.

'Making history in the 21st century? 
Where do you do that,' Manser said, adding that their crossing was the 
'biggest romantic story to be told.'

'Done! Emotional all round!' the couple posted to their Facebook page Friday afternoon, after mooring in Manhattan.

Adventure: The couple had hoped for calm seas but at times their 23ft boat was faced with challenging conditions

Manser, 40, said they had expected the 
crossing to be smoother, but their boat was tossed about on rough seas 
and at one point capsized.

'We were naïve. We thought the Atlantic 
would be this calm little pond that you just row across,' he told the New York Post.

'By the fifth day, we were 
saying to each other, what is going on? Goodness gracious. It should be a
 lot calmer. The sea was very, very, very angry.'

In February a huge swell knocked Manser from the boat, the Spirit of Madiba, which capsized with Geldenhuys still on board.

Fortunately, when it righted itself, she was still in her seat and, although they lost everything on deck, both escaped without injury.

On another occasion, Geldenhuys had to rescue her boyfriend of 15 years using their fishing line, after he fell from the boat while trying to take a photo.

Ready to go: Manser used Twitter to log their journey, which they began on December 30

'I couldn’t turn the boat around and I couldn’t stop the boat. But what saved him was the fishing line. He grabbed onto the fishing line that was behind the boat and I reeled him in,' she told CBS.

The couple also had to flag down a large ship for help when their salt-water convertor broke, leaving them with no fresh water supplies.

Manser documented their journey on Twitter, opening the account of their adventure on December 30 with the tweet: 'It's all go for Atlantic Ocean rowing Monday 9am. 90% done.100% impossible I think. I've never been this prepped in last 12 years of journeys.'

The couple described their boat capsizing in February as a wake up call, but said despite the danger, the journey was worth it.

'You
 get this quiet time, and the sun is setting, and there's like pink and 
blue and white fluffy clouds, and it's just so quiet,' Geldenhuys said.

Endurance and adventures are nothing new to the 40-year-old who in 2006 became the first person to cycle the perimeter of Africa.

It took him two years to make his way through 35 countries, and his achievement was acknowledged by Nelson Mandela who described Manser as 'a performance that will inspire the youth of the continent'.

Although most of the couple's latest adventure was spent at sea, they stopped off for a welcome break in the Bahamas in April and arrived in Florida just in time to watch a Miami Heat game.

The stops on dry land gave the couple a break from their rigorous eight-hour-a-day rowing schedule, as well as from their limited food supply.

They had packed freeze dried food, but supplemented that with whatever fish they could catch, meaning that on some days they had the freshest food available, as they feasted on huge sea bass that had been hooked out the Atlantic just moments earlier.

After reaching their destination yesterday, the couple seemed keen to take a break from the sea, and posted a fun message on Twitter offering to sell their boat.

'We have finished rowing our boat from Africa to NYC. @TM2NY Anyone keen to buy&use her to get to UK? (Comes with free advice),' Manser tweeted.
