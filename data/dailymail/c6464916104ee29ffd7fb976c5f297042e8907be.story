For years celebrities, politicians and the general Joe Public have enjoyed a gentle dip in the ponds of Hampstead Heath, sometimes clothed and sometimes not.

But now some of them may be taking a rethink - or at least considering wearing a bathing costume - as they have attracted a some rather unwelcome swimming companions.

A
breed of giant crayfish have appeared and are taking a keen interest in
the swimmers, with an apparent penchant for the Men's Pond, where many 
of the visitors swim naked.

Visitors: the red swap crayfish is know for being aggressive

The recent reports of the rather painful encounters have caused authorities to issue a new warning, advising swimmers to avoid entering the water in the nude.

Regulars at the North London park include judges, senior civil servants and local actors, artists and writers.

Along with the well-to-do locals, 
Margaret Rutherford, best known for playing Miss Marple used the Ladies'
Pond in the 1950s and actress Katharine Hepburn was a regular in the 
1960s, but chose to don a swimming costume.

Boxers Frank Bruno and John Conteh have both used the Men's Pond to prepare for fights and more recently Gary Oldman used it as a location for 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy'.

Although the red swamp crayfish, 
which are known for their aggressive behaviour and long claws, were 
first spotted 20 years ago, they have been multiplying so fast that around 5,000 of the nippers are in the ponds.

Chairman of the Hampstead Heath Anglers Association said one member had caught 180 of the crayfish in just one hour.

He said: 'They just breed and breed and breed. They eat all the fish in the ponds and there is nothing we can do to stop them. They are destroying the wildlife.'

But the bathers may be rather more worried about the physical impact of the invasion.

One swimmer, Peter McCafferty, 43, said: 'I've had a couple of nips on my toes in the past few months, usually when I stop for a rest and tread water. But some people have been nipped in altogether more sensitive places, which doesn’t bear thinking about.'

A fellow swimmer said he had also experienced a crayfish's wrath after being nipped on the bottom. 'I suppose I was lucky really - if the crayfish had decided to attack from the other side I would have been in a lot more pain,' he said. 'From now on I’m wearing my trunks.'

A spokesman for the City of London Corporation, which runs the heath said: 'We don't know how [the crayfish] got there, but a likely explanation is that they were dumped in the ponds. now that they are here, we would recommend that swimmers keep their distance to avoid getting a pinch. We would also advise people to wear clothes.'

The heath has three areas open to bathers - the Men's Pond, Ladies' Pond and Mixed Pond.

The crayfish are not the fist species to invade the ponds, which have been open to bathers since the 19th century.

As well as contended with the odd angry duck, swimmers have become used to a colony of parakeets who have also made the heath their home, possibly after having arrived after escaping from the set of John Huston's 1951 film 'The African Queen' which was shot at Shepperton Studios in Surrey.

Crayfish are significantly smaller, freshwater cousins of the lobster.

The red swamp variety, also known 
as the Louisiana crawfish is native to the US and Mexico, but was first 
noticed in Hampstead Heath ponds in 1991.

The species are able to grow quickly, being able to tolerate dry spells of up to four months, and can reach sizes of 12 cm long.

In northern Europe, the populations are self maintaining but not expanding, while in southern Europe, the red swamp crayfish is multiplying and actively colonising new territory, at the expense of the native crayfish.

Individuals are reported to be able
to cross many miles of relatively dry ground, especially in wet 
seasons, although the aquarium trade and anglers may have hastened the 
spread in some areas.

Louisiana crayfish are usually 
boiled in a large pot with heavy seasoning and other items such as 
potatoes, corn on the cob, onions, garlic, and sausage, known as a 
'crayfish boil'.
