North Korea has told the U.S. to 'pick a date and place' for high level talks to discuss tensions on the Korean peninsula only days after the Communist nation cancelled talks with rival South Korea.

The planned talks with South Korea, which would have been the first in two years, were cancelled abruptly last week by the North.

The country, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, blamed its neighbor for scuttling the discussions that were planned to seek a way mend ties between the countries.

Offer: A statement released in Pyongyang says North Korea is willing to hold high-level talks with the U.S

In a statement on the country's central news agency, KCNA, the North Korea National Defence Commission said on Sunday that Washington could pick a date and place for talks and the two sides can discuss a range of issues, but no preconditions should be attached.

'In order to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula and to achieve regional peace and safety, we propose to hold high-level talks between the DPRK and the United States,' a spokesman said.

'If the U.S. is truly interested in securing regional peace and safety and easing tensions, it should not mention of preconditions for the talks.'

Tensions in North Korea were heightened earlier this year after it threatened nuclear and missile strikes against the South and U.S.

The threats came after the United Nations imposed sanctions because the North had tested nuclear weapons in February.

In the statement, Pyongyang said it was willing to discuss disarmament, but said the rest of the world should be forced to give up their nuclear weapons. including South Korea.

It added that it wants the U.S. to sign a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War, which began after the North and South clashed five years after Allies divided the country along the 38th Parallel after liberating it from Japanese rule.

The Korean War, the first to be fought as collective action under the recently formed United Nations, ended in an armistice rather than a permanent peace treaty.Â 

North Korea agreed a denuclearization-for-aid deal under its previous leader, Kim Jong-il, in 2005 but later backed out of that accord.

It has said its nuclear arms are a 'treasured sword' that it will not abandon.

North Korea's one major diplomatic ally, China, has urged Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program and return to talks.

The North has a long record of making threats to secure concessions from the U.S. and South Korea.

Since taking over from his father in December 2011, Kim Jong-un, 30, has carried out two long-range rocket launches and a nuclear weapons test, as well as a campaign of threats.

Threats have waned in the past month, showing signs of easing tensions such as proposing talks with South Korea earlier this month.

The talks had been intended to discuss resuming operations of joint commercial projects and the issue of families split during the Korean War.
