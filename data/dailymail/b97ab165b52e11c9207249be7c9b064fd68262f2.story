David Cameron today hit back at critics of government-backed mortgages, insisting he was helping people without wealthy parents to 'realise their dreams' of owning their own home.

More than 100 people every working day are buying new homes under the Government's Help to Buy scheme, new figures show.

The Prime Minister announced that 6,000 applicants have applied for a mortgage using the scheme at a rate of 500 a week in the three months since Chancellor George Osborne unveiled the plans.

Life-changing: David Cameron has a cup of tea with Sharon Ray and her daughter Maisie, 2, during a visit to her home in Southampton, Hampshire which she has bought through the government's Help to Buy scheme

Dream: Mr Cameron said the government wanted to help more people to buy their own homes

Officials say that will mean a total of 
£910million in extra lending to those trying to get on the housing 
ladder or trade up to a larger property.

The Prime Minister hailed the scheme as
 evidence that the Government has been able to help those who can afford
 a mortgage but did not previously have the money to put down a deposit.

And he hit back at critics like Business Secretary Vince Cable who warn that Help to Buy is 
contributing to another house price boom.

Speaking on a visit to Southampton, Mr Cameron said: 'Where we are today, house prices are still way below the
peak they reached in 2007.

'Forecasters do not think they will get back to the
level before the crash even in 2019. So there is no evidence of a problem.

'This is about helping people to achieve the
security and stability they want of owning a flat or a home of their own.

'We are not helping people to buy flats or homes
they cannot afford. We are helping people who do not have wealthy
parents, who cannot get a big deposit together, and helping them to realise
their dreams.'

Bubble: On a visit to a new housing development in Southampton, the Prime Minister brushed aside fears that the Help to Buy Scheme was fuelling a new property price boom

Experts are already predicting
 house price rises of between 8 and 10 per cent next year, pushing 
property further out of reach for millions.

Mr Cable said last month that the Government should ‘look 
again’ at the Help to Buy scheme, which he blames for a ‘raging housing 
boom’ in London and the South East.

He
 warned that if the Bank of England does not raise interest rates it 
might ‘get out of control’ and mean that ‘the only people who can live 
in large parts of London are foreigners and bankers. We don’t want 
that’.

Under the scheme, 
people with a deposit of 5 per cent can get mortgages that are usually 
only available to those with a deposit of 20 per cent, because the 
Government underwrites the risk to the mortgage lenders.

But Downing Street insisted that Help to Buy supports ‘responsible lending’.

Three
 quarters of Help to Buy mortgage applications came from outside London 
and the South East and eight out of ten were from first time buyers.

On average households are looking to buy homes worth £160,000, below the UK average house price of £247,000.

Split: Chancellor George Osborne unveiled the Help to Buy scheme three months ago but Business Secretary Vince Cable has warned it risks fuelling a new house price bubble

No
 10 said applicants will face average monthly repayments of around £900 
and have an annual household income of around £45,000, making their 
mortgage payments 23 per cent of their gross income.

Mr
 Cameron added: ‘The New Year is often a time when people look to make 
those big life-changing decisions like moving home or taking that first 
step on the housing ladder.

‘But
 too many people have found themselves frozen out of the market in 
recent years as a result of the size of the deposit required.

‘That
 is why as part of our long-term economic plan we introduced the Help to
 Buy scheme, so hardworking people with sufficient earnings can get on, 
fulfil their aspirations and enjoy the security of owning their own 
home.

‘In less than three 
months, the scheme has already helped thousands of people. I want to see
 that continue in 2014 and for Help to Buy to help thousands more 
realise their dream of home ownership.’

In
 just 12 weeks since the scheme launched, nearly 750 homeowners have 
completed their purchases and hundreds were able to spend Christmas in 
their new homes.

Jade Green,
 her partner Ian and her six year old son Rhys, declared Help to Buy ‘a 
miracle’ after she was able to buy her dream home.

‘After
 a hard few years saving, our dream property came onto the market, we 
viewed it, fell in love with it, then had to come to terms with the fact
 that we couldn’t raise enough money for a deposit on a mortgage,’ she 
said.

‘Just when we had 
given up hope, Help to Buy became available, which was a miracle for us,
 it made it possible for us to afford the mortgage deposit. Only one 
week after our first viewing, we put in an offer, which was accepted and
 5 weeks later we moved in.’

Six thousand applicants have applied for a mortgage using the Help to Buy scheme at a rate of 500 a week in the three months since Chancellor George Osborne unveiled the plans

Daniel
 Fuller, a father of twins aged one and his partner moved into their new home in Sheffield at the start of December.

He
 said: ‘The help to buy scheme has given us the opportunity to get onto 
the property ladder. Without this we would have still been renting and 
buying wouldn’t have been possible, due to the large deposits. It was 
great to enjoy Christmas as a family in our own home.’

Barclays
 and Santander will introduce their own Help to Buy products onto the 
market this month, joining Lloyds, RBS, HSBC, Virgin Money and Aldermore
 who have all launched products over the last three months.

An
 additional 20,000 households have also been supported by separate 
equity loan scheme, also called Help to Buy, in which the Government 
provides an interest-free loan to support the purchase of a newly built 
home.

Liberal Democrat sources confirmed that Mr Cable remains ‘sceptical’ about the scheme.

Emma Reynolds, Labour's shadow housing ninister, said: 'Any help for first time buyers struggling to get on the property ladder is to be welcomed.

'But rising demand for housing must be matched with rising supply if this scheme is to bring the cost of housing within the reach of low and middle income earners.

'You can't deal with the cost-of-living crisis without building more homes.'
