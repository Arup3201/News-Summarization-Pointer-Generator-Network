With the transfer window open, it is crazy season in the Barclays Premier League. The new year means new beginnings and managers are scrambling around to find the man to improve their fortunes.

Wilfried Bony was the icing on the cake at Manchester City, while Gus Poyet looks relieved after finally landing Jermain Defoe. Teams want to spend big money on proper players and if I were a manager, I would want Saido Berahino in my side. He has all the qualities to become the next big thing.

When he scored a hat-trick in his first West Brom start last season, people sat up and took notice. Regular Premier League action followed, as did performances for England Under 21s and a call-up to Roy Hodgson’s senior squad.

I am surprised that more was not made of Marko Arnautovic’s cowardly push on Mathieu Debuchy. The Stoke man shoved Debuchy while he was in mid-air and now Arsenal’s right back is out for three months with a dislocated shoulder after he crashed into an advertising hoarding. On Tuesday when West Ham’s Morgan Amalfitano shoved Leighton Baines, the Everton defender was lucky to escape injury. It is a cheap shot, it shows no respect for your opponent or their safety and as a former pro it really riles me. I fractured my shoulder playing against Italy when somebody shoved me when I was already falling. It leaves you no time to brace yourself.

Gary Cahill was shoved into Joe Hart while playing for England against Belgium. He broke his jaw and missed Euro 2012.

It can look innocuous, but it’s a deliberate act and must stop. If you hit the hoarding, it’s like being shoved into a brick wall.

But despite his talent, there have always been question marks over his conduct off the pitch. That culminated in him being banned for 12 months for drink-driving after pleading guilty.

That is a real disappointment and until recently it seemed he was struggling to find the right balance in his life. It is not easy for young men to deal with overnight success and that ban means any clubs looking at signing him may tread more carefully.

I have, however, seen improvements in recent weeks and there is certainly no problem on the pitch.

After a fast start last season he suffered a bit of a dip but, despite a barren autumn, he already has six goals in three games in 2015 and is playing with a real swagger. His confidence has improved and in each game he is expressing himself more and more. He looks like the real deal.

Berahino has great technical qualities but it is the flashes of imagination that are impressing me. Whether it is an outside-of-the-foot pass, a subtle flick or an improvised finish, he is showing there is more under the bonnet each week.

His ability to score all types of goals reminds me of Ian Wright. He loves to open his body up and curl a finish into the corner but he can hit them with either foot and is good in the air. Importantly for a young striker, he is very calm in front of goal, too.

But of all the positions on the pitch, it is often the strikers who have an edge. Sergio Aguero is the league’s most well-balanced forward, physically and mentally, but a lot of top strikers come with a warning label. Luis Suarez caused Liverpool so many problems but would they take him back at Anfield? Of course they would.

West Brom manager Tony Pulis will be desperate to keep hold of star striker Berahino 

When a player shows talent, sometimes you have to take the gamble and invest in the whole package. Liverpool are just one of the clubs looking at Berahino and after the Mario Balotelli experiment failed, they will look at any future transfers closely.

But Berahino is a totally different proposition. Many of his problems are in the past and I have seen increasing signs of maturity. After scoring the winner against Hull, his first thoughts after the game were for his team.

He talked about the importance of defending well and keeping a clean sheet. You want youngsters to be team players and that is what Berahino is becoming.

That is why Tony Pulis should not let him go. If a huge offer comes in, it may be out of his hands but Berahino’s goals can be the difference between West Brom staying up or going down.

If he stays until the summer, at least he can try to keep his side in the top flight and he would leave with an enhanced reputation and even bigger price tag.
