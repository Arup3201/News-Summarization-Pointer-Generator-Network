Hilary Mantel has laughed off comparisons between her novel Wolf Hall and Prince Charles' household as being an 'exaggeration'.

The author made the comments following an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace this morning, during which she had a damehood conferred on her by Prince Charles.

Charles has endured a torrid week, thanks to the publication of a new biography, which along with comparing his household to the 'treacherous' Tudor Court, claimed he would be 'a meddling monarch'.

Exaggeration: Mantel laughed off comparisons between Wolf Hall and Clarence House this morning

The book, Charles: Heart of a King, also alleged that he attempted to back out of his 1981 wedding to Lady Diana Spencer and revealed that he compares himself to Blackadder buffoon, Baldrick.

So stung was Charles by author Catherine Meyer's less-than-flattering portrayal, he yesterday took the rare step of authorising a letter to the Times newspaper that hit back at the 'speculation' and denied that Meyer had had any sort of privileged access. 

In it, his private secretary William Nye described the contents of the book as 'ill-informed speculation' and said Charles will run a monarchy 'inspired' by that of his mother and grandfather when he takes the throne.

But it was Meyer's comparison of Clarence House to the court depicted in Wolf Hall that proved most eye-catching, with the author describing it as 'treacherous and opportunistic'. 

'One former householder refers to Clarence House as Wolf Hall,' writes Meyer, 'in reference to the treacherous and opportunistic world depicted by Hilary Mantel in her fictionalised account of the rise of Thomas Cromwell under Henry VIII.'

Proud: Mantel, seen here with her damehood, also revealed that Charles is a fan of the BBC2 adaptation

Mantel, however, would not be drawn into the controversy and laughed when asked about similarities between Clarence House and her novel.

'I couldn’t possibly comment on that,' she said. 'I think there may be an element of exaggeration there.'

Nevertheless, Mantel is no stranger to a royal controversy, having once ignited one herself courtesy of a speech in 2013 in which she described the Duchess of Cambridge as 'bland'. 

She also likened the Duchess to a 'machine-made' doll and called her 'painfully thin', adding: '[She is] without quirks, without oddities, without the risk of the emergence of character.

'She appears precision-made, machine-made, so different from Diana whose human awkwardness and emotional incontinence showed in her every gesture.'

Claims: Charles, seen here with the Duchess of Cornwall, has hit back at 'ill-informed speculation'

Not amused: The claims were made in a new book entitled: Charles: Heart of a King

Buffoon: Among the claims was the revelation that Charles compares himself to Blackadder's Baldrick

Despite Mantel's comments, she was given a warm welcome by Prince Charles, who even told the author that he is a fan of her work - despite Meyer's comparisons.

The 66-year-old royal also admitted to being a fan of the current BBC2 adaptation, which stars Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell and Damien Lewis as Henry VIII.

'We talked about the television series of Wolf Hall,' said Mantel, following the investiture. 'He is enjoying [it] very much.'

Mantel, whose books about the life of Henry VIII’s adviser Thomas Cromwell have been critical and commercial hits, was made a dame by Charles for her services to literature.

Success has come late to the 62-year-old, but she has more than made up for it by collecting a haul of literary honours, including twice winning the Man Booker Prize.
