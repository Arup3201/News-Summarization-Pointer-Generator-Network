Scott Baldwin will make his first Wales start on Saturday but there was a time when the hooker looked more likely to follow in the footsteps of Tony Hawk, the American skateboarder, than Tony Woodcock, the 110-cap All Blacks front-row.

Having ditched scrums for skate parks at the start of secondary school, a career in international rugby did not seem a likely outcome for the tearaway teenager. But the cost of competing prompted Baldwin to give up his beloved hobby and after returning to his local rugby club his career has been on an upwards trajectory.

‘Until I was 15 or 16 I was skateboarding instead of playing rugby,’ said Baldwin. ‘I came second at a British event in Bristol — my mate from Bridgend actually won it and a boy from my street came third.

‘I was one of those putting wax on the kerbs but I was snapping too many boards and they are expensive! I joined my local youth rugby team [Bridgend Athletic] and it became a lot more social than going down the skate park on your own.’

Baldwin, 26, has not looked back — apart from one impromptu outing on the board two years ago that ended with his 17st 5lb frame landing flat on the pavement. He made his Ospreys debut as a replacement against Leinster in March 2009 before earning his first Wales call-up in the summer of 2013.

On Saturday he will take over from Gloucester’s Richard Hibbard, his former Ospreys team-mate who was wearing a protective boot earlier this week, for the second Test against Fiji. Last Saturday’s home debut against the Wallabies was a baptism of fire in terms of the pace of the game, which Baldwin admits was far greater than what he is used to in the Guinness Pro12 competition.

‘Obviously, it is different coming off the bench but it was so much quicker than I have ever played,’ said Baldwin. ‘But it was something I enjoyed — apart from the result. We are focusing on all the positives, we are not hiding from what happened in that last 10 to 15 minutes, but we have to move on and focus on this week against Fiji.’

Baldwin has earned his place in the Wales side after good performances for Ospreys

The former Bridgend College student will run out in front of more than 70,000 supporters at the Millennium Stadium, with cheaper tickets meaning sales have well surpassed the disappointing turnout for Saturday’s defeat by Australia.

‘I went to college and the coach [Gareth Nicholas] said I could play in the Premiership,’ said Baldwin. ‘I thought that would be as far as I could go. Then Andrew Millward came in and gave me a chance with the Ospreys and now I have been told I’m going to start at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday. It’s a dream come true.’
