Penguins have a reputation of being funny and cute but not if you are about to be eaten by one. 

This Gentoo penguin went to investigate a camera left in the snow by a geologist on Cuverville Island, in Antarctica. 

But the hungry bird was disappointed to discover it wasn't edible when it opened its red beak wide.

Open wide: This Gentoo penguin went to investigate a camera left in the snow by a geologist on Cuverville Island, in Antarctica

The geologist was on a tour of Antarctica with G Adventures  which owns and operates the expedition vessel MS Expedition.

The researcher left the camera near a penguin highway for a couple of hours which this clip is from.

Cuverville Island is one of the largest Gentoo penguin colonies.

A member of the expedition team posted the image on Twitter and wrote: 'This Gentoo #Penguin just ate our @GoPro. #Antarctica'

Gentoo penguins have flamboyant red-orange beaks, white-feather caps, and peach-colored feet and  stand out against their drab, rock-strewn Antarctic habitat.

These charismatic waddlers, who populate the Antarctic Peninsula and numerous islands around the frozen continent, are the penguin world’s third largest members, reaching a height of 30in and a weight of 12lbs.

Gentoo parents, which often form long-lasting bonds, are highly nurturing. 

At breeding time, both parents will work to build a circular nest of stones, grass, moss, and feathers. The mother then deposits two spherical, white eggs, which both parents take turns incubating for more than a month.

Hatchlings remain in the nest for up to a month, and the parents alternate foraging and brooding duties.

Like all penguins, gentoos are a bit awkward on land. But underwater they move gracefully. 

They have streamlined bodies and strong, paddle-shaped flippers that propel them up to 22 miles an hour, faster than any other diving bird.

Adults spend the entire day hunting, usually close to shore, but occasionally ranging as far as 16 miles (26 kilometers) out. 

When pursuing prey, which includes fish, squid, and krill, they can remain below for up to seven minutes and dive as deep as 655ft.

Gentoo numbers are increasing on the Antarctic Peninsula but have plummeted in some of their island enclaves, possibly due to local pollution or disrupted fisheries. 

They are protected by the Antarctic Treaty of 1959 and received near threatened status on the IUCN Red List in 2007.
