This is the dramatic moment the bell tower of a Filipino church crumbles and falls to the ground during a 7.2 magnitude earthquake that killed 110.

In the shocking footage, the bell tower of the Basilica of the Holy Child church on the island of Cebu can be seen turning to dust moments before large sections tumble to the ground.

At one point the cross, which sat at the top of the tower, plummets to the floor - narrowly missing scores of panicked locals below.

The church, seen in footage obtained by ANC, was the country's oldest and was thought to date back to the 16th Century.

The earthquake, which struck the central island of Bohol on Tuesday, killed 110.

In Bohol, the quake's epicenter, rescuers
counted 100 dead, while nine fatalities were counted in Cebu. One died on another island.

When the quake struck, people 
gathered in a gym in Cebu rushed outside in a panic, crushing five 
people to death and injuring eight others.

Three were pulled from the rubble of numerous destroyed buildings.

The earthquake, which struck at 8.12am local time, was centred about 35 miles below Carmen town on Bohol Island and did not cause a tsunami

Nearly
half of a 17th-century limestone church in Loboc town, Bohol was reduced to rubble, as was the largest church on the island 
in Loon town, Bohol, where three worshippers were buried alive.

Many roads and bridges were damaged across the region, 
making rescue operations difficult.

The entire province was without electricity after the quake cut power supplies.

Vilma
Yorong, a provincial government employee in Bohol, said: 'We ran out of the building, and 
outside, we hugged trees because the tremors were so strong.'

'When
the shaking stopped, I ran to the street and there I saw several 
injured people. Some were saying their church has collapsed.'

Authorities set up tents for those 
displaced by the quake, while others who lost their homes moved in with 
their relatives.

Recent reports suggest there is now little hope of finding any large number of survivors from beneath the rubble.

Cebu province, about 350 miles south of Manila, has a population of more than 2.6 million people. Cebu is the second largest city after Manila. Nearby Bohol has 1.2 million people and is popular among foreigners because of its beach and island resorts and famed Chocolate Hills.

The Philippine archipelago is located in the Pacific "Ring of Fire," where earthquakes and volcanic activity are common. A magnitude-7.7 quake killed nearly 2,000 people on the northern island of Luzon in 1990.
