It's back to work and no messing about for Chelsea this week as Jose Mourinho took a hands-on approach to pre-season.

The Portuguese boss is looking for his first piece of silverware in his second spell as Blues boss and will kick off the campaign away at Burnley on Monday August 18.

That game has been chosen for live television coverage, a decision which has left supporters fuming at the prospect of being stranded in east Lancashire.

But while the schedule hasn't been kind to fans, Mourinho will be pleased with his start to the Premier League next month.

After Burnley they host Leicester City, with the manager acutely aware they must hit the ground running in what should be one of the tightest terms yet.

Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United have all strengthened as the foursome attempt to topple last year's winners Manchester City.

Branislav Ivanovic and Mohamed Salah were among the more senior figures to be involved at Cobham on Tuesday as the club await the return of their World Cup stars.

And they are without left-back Ashley Cole, whose free transfer for Roma was confirmed.

'I decided to come here in order to continue to play in the Champions League with a great and ambitious club,' Cole said.

'I realised how much the club wanted me and that they considered me useful to their project and I jumped at the opportunity.

'I arrive at an ambitious club and hope to win here.'

Meanwhile, Demba Ba has almost finalised his move to Turkish side Beskitas for around £8million.

Ba has been linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge after a season spent as third choice behind Samuel Eto'o and Fernando Torres, and with Diego Costa's £32million arrival imminent.
