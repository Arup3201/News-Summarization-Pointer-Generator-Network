A father has spoken of his relief after his 13-year-old daughter was found alive after being missing for a week.

Erika Kacicova’s father Stefan said she had befriended older men on Facebook before she disappeared from the family home in Sheffield. 

Police eventually found her 40 miles away in Bradford city centre on Monday night.

Six people were arrested in connection with the teenager’s disappearance.

Three men from the Bradford area aged 38, 41, and 43, remain in custody on suspicion of child abduction.

Three others from Bradford, a woman, 30, and two men aged 22 and 37, have been released on bail.

An 18-year-old man from the same area 
has been released from custody without charge and no further action is 
to be taken against him.

Erika Kacicova is said to be in 'good spirits'

As part of the police inquiry, Erika’s computer was taken away to establish who the girl – described as ‘bubbly and very popular’ – had been in contact with.

Last night Mr Kacicova said he had not seen his daughter since she was found because police had not allowed her to come home.

The unemployed parking attendant, originally from Slovakia, added: ‘We are very happy that she is back but we like to see her to see she is OK because we have heard not nice things about these men.’

He went on: ‘She is still with the police officers talking about what happened to her.’ Mr Kacicova said: ‘She was speaking with men on the internet before she went.

'They were older than her in their 20s and some even older than that. It was on Facebook.

‘We know about it and we try to stop her. We do not know who these men are ...’ 

Mr Kacicova, his wife Jana, Erika, her sister Bozena, ten, and brother Stefan, 11, moved to Britain two years ago.

Police said the youngster was ‘in good spirits’. Detective Inspector Helen Tate said it would take time to understand fully what happened during the days Erika was missing.
