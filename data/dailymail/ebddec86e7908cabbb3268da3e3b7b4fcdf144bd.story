Fans of the Ohio State Buckeyes may have found it difficult to sit through the team's Sept. 6 loss to the Virginia Tech Hokies, by a score of 35 - 21, but there was one very bright spot for the home team -- the Ohio State marching band.

In a stunning tribute to television, performed during halftime, the band not only played the music of nearly a dozen popular television shows, but also somehow managed to choreograph themselves to perfectly create each program's iconic image.

Among the shows included in the act were Batman, The Simpsons, Dragnet, The Addams Family, The Lone Ranger, The Brady Bunch, The Office, Hawaii Five-0, and Game of Thrones, to name just a few.

The band has previously wowed crowds with tributes to Michael Jackson, Pirates of the Caribbean, and even Abraham Lincoln. 

This weekend also marked the first time the band performed since the firing of band director Jonathan Waters for ignoring a culture of sexualized rituals and hazing among members of the band, including students being pressured to march in their underwear and participate in sexually themed stunts.

Some thought the band would not be able to keep up the high quality of their performances with him gone, but that is clearly not the case.

In fact, thanks to the band, this may be the one stadium in America that has attendees desperately trying to get tickets as far away from the field as possible.
