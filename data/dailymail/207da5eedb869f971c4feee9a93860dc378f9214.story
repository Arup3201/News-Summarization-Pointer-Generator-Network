A drink-driver who was being chased by police tried to give them the slip - by fleeing his car and hiding in a pile of manure.

Jake Hart, 22, mounted the pavement and reached speeds of 90mph as he attempted to evade officers in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire.

At one point, he was travelling so fast over speed bumps that the car left the ground and 'flew through the air'.

But after crashing into a parked car, he abandoned the vehicle - and was later found hiding in a pile of manure in a nearby park.

Now, Hart has been jailed for six months after admitting dangerous driving while over the limit at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court.

The court heard that Hart and his friend had bought a Peugeot car for £300 with the intention of doing it up and selling it on.

But when police spotted the vehicle being driven
in Blurton on April 12, they decided to stop it because its brake 
lights were not working.

Chase: Hart, 22, reached speeds of 90mph as he travelled down Trentham Road (pictured) in Stoke-on-Trent. At one point, he was travelling so fast over speed bumps that the car left the ground and 'flew through the air'

Discovery: But after crashing into a parked car, he and his passenger abandoned the vehicle. Seconds later, Hart was found by officers hiding in a pile of manure in Longton Park (pictured), telling them: 'I nearly had you'

However, when officers switched on their lights and siren, 
Hart started speeding off. 

David Bennett, prosecuting, said the Peugeot mounted the pavement to overtake a vehicle, before starting to gain speed. 

'It reached up to 45mph in a 30mph limit,' he said. 'It reached 80mph and went the wrong way around keep left bollards and reached a roundabout on the wrong side of the road.'

The car sped through Beaconsfield Drive and Blurton Road, before reaching 90mph as it travelled down Trentham Road toward Longton.

At this point, the officers abandoned the chase - and another police car took over the pursuit.

However, Hart refused to slow down and drove his car 'over speed bumps at such a speed it left the ground'.

Seconds later, he crashed into a parked car on the street - and he and his passenger abandoned the vehicle.

However, Hart was shortly discovered by officers hiding in the pile manure in Longton Park, telling them: 'I have got to try and get away. I nearly had you.'

During an interview with police, Hart claimed the car was not stolen, but admitted he had no licence and should not have been driving.

He said he had tried to evade officers because he had just paid for the car and knew they would take it away. He added that he had had his last drink about half an hour before getting into the vehicle.

Case: Now, Hart, from Blurton, has been jailed for six months after admitting dangerous driving while over the limit at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court (pictured). The defendant has also been handed a one-year driving ban

However, when breathalysed, Hart gave a reading of 47 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - 12 micrograms above the limit of 35.

Hart, from Blurton, pleaded guilty to drink driving, dangerous driving, driving with no insurance and driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence.

Andrew Bennett, mitigating, admitted the defendant had exceeded the speed limit by up to three times in a built-up area.

Sentencing Hart, Judge David Fletcher told him: 'If you had just been stopped for no brake lights you would have been over the limit with no insurance, but would not have been facing a prison sentence.

'This was a chase over a comparatively lengthy period.'

Hart has also been handed a one-year driving ban, and must take an extended test before he can drive again.
