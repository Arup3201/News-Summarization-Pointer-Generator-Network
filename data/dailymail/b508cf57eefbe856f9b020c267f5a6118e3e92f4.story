When Lady Diana Spencer asked up-and-coming fashion talent Elizabeth Emanuel to create a dress for her big day in 1981, the designer seemed set for stardom.

But 32 years on from Princess Diana's wedding, Emanuel has turned to crowdfunding as she relaunches her fashion career with a brand new label.

In a post on crowdfunding website, Crowdcube, the designer has asked investors to help her raise £750,000, with £28,000 raised within hours of Ms Emanuel's post on the site.

New venture: Elizabeth Emanuel is hoping to raise £750,000 through crowdfunding website, Crowdcube

'Recognised for dressing some of the world's most glamorous and influential women including Princess Diana's royal wedding dress, Elizabeth Emanuel is now embarking on a new venture.' reads the accompanying post.

'Art of Being will be the commercial vehicle bringing Elizabeth’s new and exciting [sic] design concepts to market through direct and indirect retailing, franchising and licencing agreements.'

The designer is not the first A-lister to turn to Crowdcube with Easyjet founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou and interior designer Kevin McCloud among those to launch new ventures with the help of the site.

Ms Emanuel, who has also seen Elizabeth Taylor and Joan Collins - among many others - step out her designs, struggled to maintain the momentum built up by Princess Diana's wedding gown and lost the right to trade under her own name in the mid-1990s.

Big fan: TV presenter Charlie Webster is a big fan of Emanuel's new label and wore it twice last week

Since then, Ms Emanuel has battled back with a series of colourful collections, including 2013's Chocolate Collection, which proved a hit with celebrities and critics alike.

Her new label, Art of Being, has already had some success, with TV presenter Charlie Webster stepping out in Emanuel-designed frocks on two separate occasions last week.

Webster, 31, who is currently dating Downton Abbey star Allen Leech, 33, wore a black crystal embellished cocktail dress for the IWC gala in honour of the British Film Institute at Battersea Evolution last Tuesday.

A second black cocktail dress, this time minus the crystals, was chosen for the premiere of The Imitation Game the following night.

According to reports in the Telegraph, the designer's new output will start at £20,000 for a couture gown, while pieces from her ready-to-wear collection will cost a minimum of £1,500.
