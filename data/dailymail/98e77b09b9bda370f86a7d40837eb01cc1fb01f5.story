A group of Filipino criminals who shot to YouTube fame performing a brilliant dance routine to Michael Jackson's Thriller in their prison courtyard are to be celebrated in a new Hollywood film.

Dressed in distinctive orange jumpsuits, some 1,500 criminals at Cebu provincial prison, including convicted murderers, rapists and drug addicts, featured in the 2007 viral which has now had over 52million hits.

Their choreographed acts attract 
thousands of tourists who troop to the prison to watch the performance, 
which recently included 'Gangnam Style.'

'Dance of the Steel Bars', a movie drama about redemption and corruption behind bars, was shot on location inside the prison.Some of the dancing inmates 
appear in the movie too.

It
stars Irish actor Patrick Bergin, who played Julia Roberts' husband in 
'Sleeping With the Enemy,' and Filipino heartthrob Dingdong Dantes.

The
Dubai-based producer, Portfolio Films International, said the story 
follows Bergin's character, Frank Parish, a retired U.S. firefighter and
philanthropist wrongly jailed for murder in the Philippines.

He befriends Mando, played by 
32-year-old Dantes, a convicted murderer who denies his passion for 
dancing to prove his masculinity.

Another
character, Allona, played by Joey Paras, is a transsexual who teaches 
dance to his fellow inmates to contribute to prison reforms.

They
are caught up in a struggle between the positive changes being 
implemented by the new jail warden and a corrupt prison system.

Marnie Manicad, who co-directed the 
movie with television reporter Cesar Apolinario, said Wednesday that the
story is fictional but inspired by real stories of the inmates.

'We made this film to tell the story of redemption, and of the human spirit's ability to change for the better,' she said.

Manicad, her husband and television reporter Jiggy Manicad, and Apolinario co-wrote the story. The screenplay is by Cris Lim.

The inmates perform a tribute dance routine following the death of Michael Jackson in 2009. It was their routine to the late pop star's song Thriller that brought them to global attention

Shooting inside the actual prison, with dance sequences of the inmates included, presented a unique challenge, Manicad said. But she praised the inmates for their discipline and self-respect.

The prison scenes were shot over a week in 2010, and the entire production took about three years.

'I cannot do much for them except tell their story to the world through this movie,' she said.

The movie is set for local release on June 12. Its creators plan to enter it in international film festivals and for screenings in major cities abroad.
