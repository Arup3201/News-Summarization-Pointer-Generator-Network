A brain-boosting milkshake that is said to reduce symptoms of early Alzheimer's has gone on sale in the UK today.

The drink contains a mix of ‘memory boosting’ nutrients including those found in breast milk and herring.

The ‘medical food’ comes after a decade 
of research into a formula food that might improve the brain function of
people in the early stages of the disease.

The makers of Souvenaid claim it can help reduce the symptoms of early Alzheimer's

Souvenaid, taken as a 125ml once-a-day drink, has ingredients that work together to boost brain cells important for memory.

It
contains omega 3 fatty acids, the nutrient found in fish which is known
to be good for the brain, with a daily dose equivalent to eating three 
or four herrings.

The drink also contains two other compounds 
normally present in the blood - uridine, which is produced by the liver 
and kidneys and found in breast milk, and choline found in meat, nuts 
and eggs - B vitamins and other nutrients.

It will be available 
over-the-counter in pharmacies and online at £3.49 for a daily dose - 
adding up to almost £1,300 a year - and consumers have to confirm they 
have consulted a doctor or other health professional.

Studies 
originally carried out by researchers at Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology suggest it helps improve memory performance after six months 
in people with mild Alzheimer’s who are not taking drugs.

However, a study on people with moderate Alzheimer’s who were on prescribed medication found no improvement.

The Alzheimer's Society has warned the milkshake 'is a lot less effective than current drugs available for people in the early stages of dementia'

Some
have welcomed Souvenaid for providing a new dietary aid to improve the 
health of early Alzheimer’s patients, but critics warned it was an 
expensive option that was less effective than drugs.

Around 800,000 people in the UK live with dementia, of which Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form.

The
loss of connections in the brain called synapses which help relay 
information is one of the key features of early Alzheimer’s.

The 
three main compounds in Souvenaid are needed by brain nerve cells to 
make phospholipids, the primary component of cell membranes that form 
synapses.

Dr David Wilkinson, Consultant in Old Age Psychiatry, said 
‘Alzheimer’s disease is not part and parcel of aging but a serious and 
progressive disease of the brain which prevents us from being able to 
retain new memories.

‘As we age, our bodies become less efficient at 
processing essential nutrients, meaning that we need to increase our 
intake of food to absorb the same amount of nutrients in order to 
maintain a healthy body. In the same way, we need the right nutrients 
for our brains to keep them healthy.

‘Alzheimer’s disease sufferers 
often find it very difficult to get everything they need through diet 
alone and the nutritional intervention by the use of Souvenaid is a new 
area of research offering promising results for the management of early 
Alzheimer’s disease.’

Products marketed as food for special medical 
purposes do not have to go through the same EU regulatory process as 
drugs.

But they have to prove they are ‘safe and beneficial and 
effective in meeting the particular nutritional requirements of the 
persons for whom they are intended’ and must be taken under medical 
supervision.

People buying Souvenaid, which comes in two flavours 
vanilla and strawberry, are being urged to speak with a doctor, 
specialist nurse, dietitian or pharmacist first.

Professor Clive 
Ballard, director of research at the Alzheimer’s Society charity, said 
‘People shouldn’t get excited that an off-the-shelf drink is going to 
transform the lives of people with dementia.

‘While past studies of 
this product have showed some benefits for memory, there is no evidence 
that it has an effect on other aspects of thinking or everyday life and 
there was also no benefit on other symptoms of dementia.

‘This is 
likely to cost about £1000 a year and is a lot less effective than 
current drugs available for people in the early stages of dementia.

‘For
many older people with dementia where finances might be tight, people 
are probably much better off putting their money towards good quality 
care or taking part in exercise.

‘One in three people over 65 will 
develop dementia. It’s vital we continue to fund research into new 
treatments to enable people to live well with the condition.’

Barbara 
Stephens, chief executive of Dementia UK charity, said ‘A diagnosis of 
dementia is devastating both for those with the condition and their 
families and carers.

‘Early stage intervention is important for 
maximising choices and enabling people with dementia and their carers to
lead healthier lives for longer.’

Souvenaid is made by Nutricia, the 
medical foods division of Danone Research.
