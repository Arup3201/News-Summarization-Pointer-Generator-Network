Triple J has defended its decision to publish an opinion poll on how many Australians support the death penalty following claims the station should be held accountable if the pair are executed.

The poll, titled 'Australians think Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran should be executed', found 52 per cent of Australians, in principle, support death sentences for overseas drug traffickers.

After news the two men lost their last chance of escaping after a second judicial review was rejected on Wednesday, supporters of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan said the decision was skewed by the poll.

In a statement read out by Hack presenter Tom Tilley on Thursday, the station stood by its decision and said media outlets must uphold freedom of speech.

 'It would be a dangerous precedent for journalists not to report these things because they are fearful of how politicians may react,' he said.

Radio show Triple J commissioned the research by Roy Morgan Research and also posed the question on their Facebook page

The radio show published the results of their poll on 26 January saying '60 per cent of young Australians don't think the government should do more to stop the execution' 

Tilley said while he and his colleagues held the deepest sympathies for the two men and their families, media publications regularly use polling in news reporting stories.

Supporters of the two men have been heart-stricken by news they will be the next to face execution.

Their Australian lawyer Julian McMahon said: 'The boys have really turned their lives into very constructive lives for other prisoners so the families are very proud of them.'

'There's a lot of closeness there but from my observation what'll be happening now is that the two clients will be looking after their families, who will be shattered.'

Greg Craven, the vice-chancellor of the Australian Catholic University, said the poll should not have been cancelled.

'If these two men really are executed then the radio station that commissioned the poll, the people who delivered that poll, and the people who answered that poll in the affirmative will know that they have had a part, no matter how small, in the death of two other people,' he said.

He hopes to disprove the poll, and has urged all Australians to keep pleading with the Indonesian authorities to show mercy towards the two men. 

The question that was actually asked in the poll was much broader and was only referring to death sentences in principle and not the two men's specific case.

'In your opinion if an Australian is convicted of drug trafficking in another country & sentenced to death, should the penalty be carried out?,' the question said.

Mr McMahon told SMH the result 'is now a tool being used to get my clients killed'.

'The AG and the ambassador have publicly relied on the SMS poll as a factor justifying execution. They say that it pushes them to do it, that they have Australian public support,' Mr McMahon reasoned.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Triple J Hack show for comment.  

Gary Morgan, executive chairman of Roy Morgan Research, defended way the poll was carried out to the SMH.

When the poll results were originally published Morgan said in a statement: 'A slight majority of Australians (52%) say that Australians convicted of drug trafficking in another country and sentenced to death should be executed.

Lawyers for the Bali Nine ringleaders on Friday applied for a second judicial review of their case, examining past errors of the law and their transformation over a decade in jail 

Indonesia has used results from radio host Tom Tilley's (pictured) Triple J listeners to justify sending Aussies to the firing squad, according to the Bali Nine ringleaders' lawyer 

'However, there is a clear gender split with men (60%) in favour of the death penalty being carried out while only 46% of women believe that convicted drug traffickers overseas should be executed.' 

Indonesia's courts rejected an application for a judicial review into the cases of Chan and Sukumaran again on Wednesday despite a strong campaign for mercy being pushed from the 'highest level' of Australian government.

Foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop and Tony Abbott promised they 'continued to raise the cases' with the Indonesian government. 

'My personal view is that an execution of drug traffickers will not stop the problem of drugs in and out of Indonesia, that there's a much broader approach that needs to be taken, however, the Indonesian government seems to be intent on pursuing the death penalty for drug traffickers,' Ms Bishop said.

Lawyers for the Bali Nine ringleaders on Friday applied for a second judicial review of their case, examining past errors of the law and their transformation over a decade in jail.

Denpasar District Court spokesman Hasoloan Sianturi on Wednesday told reporters the application was rejected. 

The spokesman said after considering the documents put forward for a judicial review, known as a PK, neither man's application could be accepted.

'The documents of that PK will not be sent to the Supreme Court,' he told reporters in Bali.

Indonesian authorities have continued planning for the execution of Chan, Sukumaran and others even while the application was before the courts.

Foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop said she and Tony Abbott have 'continued to raise the cases' of Chan and Sukurmaran with the Indonesian government.

It comes after a slight glimmer of hope from the Denpasar District Court chief, Judge Sugeng Riyono, who was yet to make a decision on the matter on Tuesday.

'There is no difficulty. We just have to look at all the regulations, including the Constitutional Court decision, the Supreme Court decree as well as the joint decision that was made in January,' Mr Riyono previously said according to News Corp.

Chan and Sukumaran's lawyer, Mr McMahon, argued that his clients had clearly exhibited that they had been rehabilitated since their sentencing in 2006.

'Anyone who studies the facts in the case of Sukumaran and Chan would immediately know they should not be treated as if they are merely criminals. In fact because of the Indonesian penal system they have become reformed prisoners and valuable contributors helping Indonesia. It simply makes no sense now to kill them,' Mr McMahon told News Corp.

It was revealed on Monday that the Bali Nine pair would be killed by a firing squad in the next round of executions.

The pair, who have been on death row since 2006, could face death at any stage under a crackdown by the Indonesia government on drug cases. 

According to Nine News Sukumaran and Chan will be taken in the dead of night from their cells at Kerobokan Prison in Denpasar and flown to Jogjakarta. From there they will take a five-hour journey through the villages of Java before they arrive at the port of Cilicap.

The men will then be taken by boat into restricted waters, where they will get their first glimpse of the notorious correctional centre on Nusa Kambangan.

From there the Australian men will be housed in one of the seven prisons on the island, where they will live out the remainder of their days before they are lined up in front of the executioners. 

Nusa Kambangan is where the Bali bombers faced the firing squad and where six drug criminals were executed two weeks ago.
