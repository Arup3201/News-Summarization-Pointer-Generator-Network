Ronny Deila assessed Tony Watt and found a footballer with talent and pace to burn. A local boy who had been a Celtic supporter all his life.

But when the Norwegian looked a little closer he detected none of the dedication and selfless sacrifice required to be a lifelong Celtic servant.

A former schoolteacher, the Norwegian issued a blunt warning to the current crop of Parkhead players. Scoring a winning goal against Barcelona at the age of 19 is no guarantee of a long Parkhead career.

Departed: Tony Watt in action for Celtic in a pre-season friendly against FC St Pauli before his move 

Unless young players progress and show a willingness to devote themselves to Deila’s culture of slavish professionalism, they will be shown the door just like Watt, who was sold to Standard Liege for £1.3million on Monday.

Echoing some of the criticisms made by Neil Lennon and Stanley Menzo, coach of Lierse where Watt spent last season on loan, Deila answered supporters’ queries over his sale by delivering a damning verdict.

‘I have talked a lot with Tony and he knows that to develop you have to train 100 per cent every day,’ he said. ‘You have to be prepared every day. You have to sacrifice everything to improve.

‘Tony took a few small steps - but he has still a lot to work on. He has a big talent but he also has a history at Celtic which makes it harder for him to come through than I think it will be in Belgium.

‘He has the chance to start all over and try to take with him some of the things we have talked about. Maybe one day he can come back to Celtic again and be the star he wants to be.’

Too much too soon: Watt shot to fame when he scored the winner against Barcelona in 2012 aged just 19

Right now few would care to bet on what the future holds for the Coatbridge striker. If the penny drops in Belgium he can be a Scotland mainstay for years. If he stubbornly refuses to listen to the well-meaning advice of a succession of coaches, he could just as easily be driving a taxi in five years time.

‘It’s about education,’ said Deila. ‘There are many things that go through the heads of young players.

‘Think back to how you were when you were aged between 17 and 20. I know I made a lot of mistakes when I was that age.

‘But you learn from experience. The difference between a very good talent and a not so good talent is how they learn as they grow up. Learn from the mistakes and take with you the positives.

‘Tony hasn’t progressed as we wanted so far and I think that’s because he hasn’ t been getting into the right culture, realising the consequences and changing his mentality.

Teamwork: But Deila has questioned Watt's dedication and commitment to football following his Celtic exit

‘Now it’s good for him to start all over and to be the professional he needs to be to get to the highest level that he can.’

Watt angrily dismisses question marks over his attitude or professionalism. He admits he was never the strongest trainer, but refutes suggestions that a famous goal against Barca went to his head. Or that his diet and off-field discipline was lax.

‘When you see Fraser Forster, Emilio Izaguirre and Efe Ambrose, you are looking at top professional players,’ added Deila.

‘They work so hard, stay after training, go to bed at 10 o’clock - they do everything perfect. It’s no coincidence those three were playing at the World Cup Finals. The culture they have is the one we want to give to the young Scottish players.

‘Also, we have guys like Charlie Mulgrew and Scott Brown who give 100 per cent every day, every time they step on to a pitch. My job is to make that culture throughout the club. The young players have to look up to people like this and realise the standard they need every day.”

Watt has proclaimed himself delighted with the move to Belgium, where he enjoyed a measure of success on loan last season. 

Earning good money at a top European club can hardly be described as a penance for bad behaviour, yet on Saturday in Hamburg the striker was expressing the wish to stay with Celtic for a very long time.

All ears: Celtic players listen to a team talk from Deila during a pre-season friendly

The club – and Deila – had other ideas.

Asked what will happen to any young player who follows Watt’s lead at Parkhead, he said bluntly: ‘You have no chance. No player can achieve his dreams if he does not work.

‘It’s about commitment. If you say to yourself you are going to be a Celtic player you have to change.

‘You have to commit, you have to make that sacrifice.

‘It’s not just about Tony – it’s the same with all players. If you don’t accept the consequences of your actions you will look back and say at the end of your career: “I was a good footballer, but I was just a player at Celtic.”

‘If you really listen, if you really do it, you can be a legend at Celtic.

‘I was one of these guys. I wasn’t the greatest talent as a player, but I could have been much better than I was because I didn’t sacrifice everything.

‘I didn’t get the treatment or learn what is important. I want the staff here to be like a library – one where the players can borrow whatever knowledge they need to improve.’
