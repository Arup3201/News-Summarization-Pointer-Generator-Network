A 52-year-old man accused of punching another man and hitting him with his car in a dispute over pew space in a Utah church last June has been ordered to spend 30 days in jail.

Wayne George Dodge was sentenced Wednesday by Judge W. Brent West after pleading guilty to one misdemeanor assault charge, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. He was also ordered to complete an anger management class and pay a fine.

Dodge was booked at the Weber County Jail on Monday.

Weber County deputies say the fight happened on June 30 last year at the Meadows Ward of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for a crowded service that included a baby blessing and a missionary farewell.

Authorities say Dodge sat in a three-row section that a male visitor had saved in hopes of getting a good view of the baby blessing.

Dodge allegedly punched the man after the service and struck him with his vehicle in the parking lot.

'[Dodge] ended up throwing a couple of punches and striking this individual,' Weber County Sheriff's Lt. Mark Lowther told the Deseret News last year.

'He had some blood coming from his face, so he went inside the church to clean up. And when he exited the church, [Dodge] was in his car. I guess there was another confrontation.'

'It's not worth the injury, and it's not worth the legal consequences for something as basic as this,' he also said.
