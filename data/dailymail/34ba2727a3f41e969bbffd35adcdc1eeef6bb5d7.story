Popular: Audience figures show Chris Evans has almost doubled his lead over Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw

He was hired to win over a younger audience, but it seems Nick Grimshaw is having the opposite effect.

Hundreds of thousands of listeners have been switching off his Radio 1 breakfast show – and turning over to Radio 2 rival Chris Evans instead.

The latest audience figures show Evans has almost doubled his lead over the Radio 1 programme since this time last year.

Yesterday Evans, the former wild man who has found happiness in his third marriage and fatherhood, was celebrating trouncing Grimshaw in the latest quarterly results from Rajar, which measures radio audiences.

The former Big Breakfast host appears to be attracting most of the disaffected Radio 1 listeners and posted record results of 9.8million in the three months to the end of March.

This is a jump of 600,000 from 9.2million in the same period of 2012 and also up on the previous quarter.

The figures show that the decision to claw back younger listeners to Radio 1 by replacing 39-year-old Chris Moyles with Grimshaw, 28, in September last year has had a disastrous effect.

The DJ, who is known to revel in his celebrity party lifestyle, has lost more than a million listeners who were tuning in to Moyles a year ago.

Grimshaw’s ratings have plummeted to 5.8million a week – leaving what is thought to be the biggest ever gap between the two stations’ breakfast audiences.

He also scored Radio 1’s fewest listeners for the slot since Sara Cox hosted the show in 2003.

Even the Today programme on Radio 4 is now regularly beating the Radio 1 programme, securing 6.9million listeners in the latest set of results.

Yesterday the corporation put on a 
brave face on the drop in listeners for Grimshaw and also for the 
station generally, which fell by almost 900,000 to 10.3million.

It said the ‘new Radio 1 schedule, aimed at a younger audience’ was ‘still bedding in’

.

The BBC claimed that although the audience was smaller it was ‘more focused on a younger demographic’ with its highest proportion of 15 to 24-year-old listeners since 2010.

Helen Boaden, director of BBC Radio, said Radio 1 was ‘in good health’.

She added: ‘The brand new schedule continues to bed in at Radio 1 and we remain confident that it will emerge strongly from a period of transition.’

A BBC Radio source said the department had ‘anticipated the drop’ and that changing the make-up of the audience was 'not going to be painless'. They added it had been deliberate plan to try and encourage older Radio 1 listeners over to Radio 2, which appeared to have worked.

The station was forced by the BBC Trust to make more efforts to lower the age of its audience amid concerns it had not been attracting enough young listeners, who are meant to be its target audience.

Grimshaw, who has also been given his own BBC3 TV series, failed to land a nomination for the breakfast show of the year title at the Sony Awards earlier this week.

Evans' unprecedented figures help propel Radio 2 to a record 15.3million listeners a week - a five per cent jump from the same period last year.

Radio 3 continued a ratings revival with both its overall and breakfast show figures showing an increase.

The figures also showed that listening to digital radio has continued its modest increase, now accounting for 34.3 per cent of listening, up from 33 per cent the previous quarter. At the same time listening to AM and FM went down slightly by about two per cent to 60.5 per cent.
