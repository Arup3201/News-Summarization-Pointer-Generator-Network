Sophie Dahl and her musician husband Jamie Cullum are planning on moving into her grandfather's home, according to reports.

The model-turned-author and granddaughter of one of the world's most famous children's writers could be moving into Gipsy House, in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, with her husband 'within the next year'.

Roald Dahl used the hut in the garden of the property to write his books, including classics such as Matilda, James And The Giant Peach and The BFG.

According to the Sunday Times, the author's second wife Felicity, known as Liccy, currently lives in the house but is understood to be moving to the West Country.

The paper has reported Dahl, 36, and Cullum, 34, who already live in a £3m house in the village, could move in when the property is vacated.

The Dahl family caused a stir in September 2011 when they appealed for £500,000 to save the writing hut and move it from the garden to the nearby Roald Dahl Museum for public display.

The plan was hoped to stop the decay which left the hut in danger of collapse.

The legendary children's author visited the hut every day for 30 years in 
order to write. Only he was allowed into the structure.

The
idea to move the shed came from the author's grandson, Luke Kelly, who 
was inspired by relocation of Francis Bacon's studio to the Hugh Lane 
gallery in Dublin.

At the time, Roald Dahl's widow Felicity said: 'It is a forensic exercise, not only to retain the eccentric objects but more importantly the magical atmosphere that fed Roald's seemingly limitless imagination.'

Felicity inherited the bulk of the £2.8million the writer left in his will after his death in 1991 - worth nearly £5million in today's terms.

Sophie Dahl also said at the time: 'When my grandfather died, he left in his wake an aching gap, but also a palpable magic and limitless imagination, which is not exclusive to my family.

'It is now time for us to save the hut but, even more importantly, to share it.'
