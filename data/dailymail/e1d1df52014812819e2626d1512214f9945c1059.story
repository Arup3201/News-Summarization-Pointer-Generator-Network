On Jose Mourinho's return to Stamford Bridge he told Chelsea supporters: 'I am one of you now' - and if their imminent new signing is to be believed, the Blues squad will soon boast another fan in its ranks.

Chelsea-bound Atletico Madrid left back Filipe Luis has claimed that he has 'always liked Chelsea a lot' in a press conference announcing his departure from the Spanish champions.

And the 28-year-old even used Atletico's Champions League semi final visit to Stamford Bridge as a scouting mission to check out the atmosphere among the fans at Chelsea's 109-year home.

The Blues confirmed on Wednesday that they had reached a £16million agreement for the transfer of Luis - and at a departing press conference, the Brazilian claimed only a special offer could move him from the Spanish capital.

'I never thought about leaving Atletico,' he said. 'But I took the decision because of the offer which came from Chelsea.

'A change of team gives new hunger and ambition, and I was worried about being too comfortable here. A footballer’s career is very short and I want to finish it in a strong and spectacular way.

Luis could be playing alongside former Atletico team mates Diego Costa and Thibaut Courtois next season - and he made his best efforts to endear himself to his new supporters in London.

'I have always liked Chelsea a lot. I watch a lot of the Premier League and it is a club where you can feel the warmth of the fans,' said Luis, who has been capped four times by Brazil.

'When we played there in the Champions League I felt comfortable in their stadium and when the offer came I thought it was the ideal team for me to play for in England.'

Luis is expected to agree personal terms with Chelsea this week to finalise his £20million switch.
