Links: Sir David Bell, who is one of Lord Leveson's key advisers, is also on the board of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism

A senior adviser helping Lord Leveson's inquiry into press standards is a trustee of the organisation behind the shambolic Newsnight report that falsely implicated Lord McAlpine as a paedophile, it has emerged.

Sir David Bell is on the board of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, whose botched investigation into abuse at a north Wales children's home has left its reputation in tatters.

The former chairman of the Financial Times is also one of six senior figures aiding Leveson's inquiry, whose official report is due out this month.

Meanwhile the head of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism Iain Overton has quit after starting the crisis that has ripped through the 
BBC.

His name and photo has been removed from the Bureau's website and his
linked Twitter account, which announced the disastrous Newsnight 
investigation to the world before it was broadcast, has been shut down.

'An appointment of an Interim Editor is likely to be announced in the near term.An inquiry to establish the role of The Bureau in the story is in urgent progress. An interim report will be issued as soon as possible,' a BIJ spokesman said.

'Trustees reaffirm The Bureau’s commitment to fact-based, non-sensational investigation in the public interest. Any role by the Bureau or its officers in this story was strictly contrary to the fundamental principles and standards of the Bureau.'

MailOnline has been told Mr Overton was diagnosed with a serious and 
life-changing illness that led to him consuming 'potent medication' and 
‘taking his eye off the ball' as the investigation was put together by 
his staff, a source close to him said.

He is 'distraught' at what had happened and is 'desperate to 
apologise', they added.

'Iain is distraught and mortified by his tweet and what happened 
next. He desperately wants 
to say sorry.

'He fears he has undone years of hard-work for him and the Bureau.'

The source added that his Twitter post was something 'he deeply 
regretted' and despite Mr Overton later erasing the message all the 
damage was done.

But the source said the BBC, not the bureau, should blamed for taking the decision to go ahead with it.

'The moment the BBC take an investigation from the Bureau then all 
editorial decisions leave their hands and are taken by them’.

Mr Overton spent yesterday holding crisis talks with the group’s trust over its role in the fiasco.

In the spotlight: Bureau reporter Angus Stickler who led the Newsnight probe into child abuse in north Wales

It is understood that Mr Overton 
receives an annual salary and pension totalling £75,000, plus a 
discretionary bonus of up to £6,000 per year.

He was previously a commissioning executive at ITN and a senior producer at the BBC.

His staff – including reporter Angus Stickler – had worked with the BBC on the botched report which has already forced the resignation of director general George Entwistle.

But it was a message Mr Overton tweeted in which he claimed Newsnight was about to reveal ‘a very senior political figure who is a paedophile’ which prompted an online storm.

Although Mr Overton did not identify Lord McAlpine – and Newsnight chose not to – the former Conservative Party chairman’s name was soon widely linked to the investigation.

A statement from the BIJ said: 'The Trustees are appalled at what appears to be a breach of its standards.

'To the extent that the principles of the Bureau have been ignored by an involvement in this story, remedial action will be taken against those responsible.'

The BIJ was founded in 2009 with a £2million donation from a charitable foundation run by computer tycoon David Potter, a former Labour donor, and his wife Elaine Potter, a former Sunday Times investigative journalist.

Based out of subsidised offices in London's City University, the BIJ employs a combination of experienced journalists and students, including interns from the university's journalism department.

At its launch, some of the most respected investigative journalists in the industry gave the project their backing.

In 2009 Nick Davies, the journalist who exposed the News of the World hacking scandal, freedom-of-information campaigner Heather Brooke, David Leigh were among 20 journalists who met to set up a new organisation to promote investigative journalism.

The BIJ was an offshoot of those meetings but Mr Davies, Mr Leigh and Ms Brooke have never had any role in its inception at all or any connection to the bureau since.

The few journalists who appear to be on permanent staff include Mr Overton and Mr Stickler, who was once named News Journalist of the Year at the Sony Radio Academy Awards.

Investigations he has worked on in the past two years include an exposé on 'counterfeit pharmaceuticals, corporate killings in Iraq, human rights abuses by the Brazilian police and Glasgow gang-land murders linked to security contracts,' he says on his website.

He has won one Peabody Award, two Amnesty International Awards, a OneWorld Award, a Prix Circom, a BAFTA Scotland and 3 RTS nominations.

Last night a source said Mr Overton had been taking 'potent medication' for a recently diagnosed serious illness and that this, in part, had led to him to tweet 'unwisely'.

The source added that his Twitter post was something 'he deeply regretted'. Mr Overton later erased the message but the damage was done.

He is now under pressure to quit. A source who works at the City of London university where his team are based told the Mail Online: 'He will be lucky to survive.'

The BIJ claims to have been behind 47 front page stories since its launch and has won awards from Amnesty International and Thomson Reuters.

But it attracted controversy in August over a joint investigation with Newsnight which claimed the charity Help For Heroes used some of its money to subsidise Ministry of Defence building projects rather than help for injured service personnel. The charity claimed the report was misleading.

The McAlpine investigation was handled by BIJ 'lead reporter' Mr Stickler, a former BBC journalist who worked on Radio 4's Today programme and File on Four.

He was seconded to Newsnight to work on the abuse investigation, under the supervision of acting editor Liz Gibbon, to preserve the BBC's editorial control.

Mr Stickler issued a statement through the National Union of Journalists yesterday, saying he was cooperating with reviews by the BBC and the BIJ, but would make no public comment until they were completed.

All reports by the Bureau have been suspended by the BBC.

An early version of this article posted on November 11 stated that certain journalists were involved with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. These were Nick Davies, Heather Brooke, Phillip Knightley, Martin Bright, Misha Glenny, Mark Hollingsworth, Andrew Jennings and David Leigh.  We are happy to clarify that in fact none has ever been involved with, or worked for, the BIJ.  In addition we stated that City University’s former head of journalism Adrian Monck was an adviser to the Bureau. This was not the case.
