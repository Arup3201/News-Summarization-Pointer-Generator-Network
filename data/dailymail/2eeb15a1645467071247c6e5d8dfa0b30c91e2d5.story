The Will It Blend? campaign has destroyed iPhones, paintballs and even a bottle of Old Spice but its latest video takes the experiment to another level.

Host Tom Dickson put a string of magnetic toys known as Buckyballs inside a blender.

As the blades hit the strong magnets, sparks are seen flying through the blender and smoke turns the air inside it black.

The strong magnets, known as Buckyballs are made using neodymium - a rare earth element. They were blended by Will it Blend? host Tom Dickson from Utah-based blender firm Blendtec (pictured) 

Buckyballs are made from a rare earth element called neodymium.

A typical magnet is formed when unpaired spinning electrons line up to a magnetic field.

In a neodymium atom there are seven of these unpaired electrons around each atom, and when it is used with in an alloy with iron and boron, for example, a small powerful magnet is produced.

Between 2009 and July last year, more than 1,700 swallowing incidents were linked to the high-powered magnets.

The manufacturer recalled the balls in 2012 and offered full and partial refunds.   

Buckyballs are no longer in production, and federal law in the US bans them from being sold.

In the video, Mr Dickson blends the balls for almost a minute.

Sparks begin to fly within seconds, and gradually make the blender glow a bright orange. 

At the end of the video, Mr Dickson tips the balls out in a solid black lump. 

He also describes how much dust was produced by the blending.  

Professor Malcolm Levitt, head of Magnetic Resonance for Chemistry at the University of Southampton told MailOnline: 'The sparks are caused by frictional heating, just as for a screeching brake.

'The hard blender blades strike sparks as they cut into the metal balls. 

'The metal fragments are strongly magnetic so stick to each other forming a solid mass at the end.'

The reason that sparks are produced is particularly down to the fact neodymium oxidises in air. 

As Kevin O'Grady, professor of physics at the University of York, explained: 'In fact, neodymium and similar metals are the basis of of flints.

'Hence if you chip bits off, they ignite in air. 

'As the blending goes on further smaller fragments are produced and the temperature goes up creating more sparks.'

Will It Blend? is a viral campaign designed to promote Blendtec's range of blenders. 

Since 2006, Mr Dickson has blended marbles, golf balls, light bulbs, iPhones and iPods, glow sticks and a Justin Bieber doll. 

He has been criticised for the dangerous stunts, and all videos are caveated with a 'do not try this at home' warning.

Professor Levitt continued: 'The most remarkable thing about the video is the cavalier attitude with respect to the toxic rare-earth metal smoke. 

'Even if they have good reason there is no way anyone should do this without using safe ventilation equipment and a way to confine and collect the smoke.'
