'Lacking clarity: Ed Miliband stands on a pallet as he speaks to members of the public in Hastings, East Sussex, after the local elections this month

Ed Miliband’s leadership of the Labour Party was under renewed scrutiny last night as its lead  over the Conservatives fell to just three points.

Support for the Opposition has slumped to 34 per cent, down four points from a month ago, and its lowest level since the 2010 general  election, according to the latest poll from Ipsos Mori.

The Conservatives were up two points, despite internal turmoil over the EU referendum, poor local election results and the fact the Government is in mid-term.

Strategists are blaming Labour’s own lack of clarity on Europe and disillusionment with the leadership of Mr Miliband for the poor performance in the polls and this month’s local elections.

The poll put the Conservatives on 31 per cent while UKIP were at 13 per cent – ahead of the Lib Dems, who remained unchanged on ten per cent.

However the survey is of those who say they are certain to vote – and Labour supporters are less likely to say they will definitely turn up at the ballot box.

But it does underscore how soft Labour’s lead is.

Privately, Labour insiders are warning of a ‘crisis of legitimacy’ if the party only secures a 34 per cent share of the vote at the next  general election.

While it would still give the party a parliamentary majority of around 30 seats, it would be the lowest winning percentage of the vote since the Whigs won in 1832.

Mr Miliband’s personal approval ratings were unchanged from last month, with 35 per cent satisfied and 49 per cent dissatisfied.

Senior party figures including Lord Mandelson have warned that the unions have further entrenched their grip on Labour, dictating  candidate selections for the 2015 general election.

Alistair Darling, the former Chancellor, has also said voters needed clarity on Mr Miliband’s ‘direction of travel’, adding that the party also had to reveal its economic plans if it wanted to win voters’ trust.

Tony Blair has also taken a swipe at Mr Miliband’s leadership, warning last month Labour was in danger of becoming party of protest. He said the party had to resist temptation to ‘settle back into its old territory of defending the status quo’.

Alan Milburn, the former health secretary, added his support to Mr Blair, saying: ‘The closer the election comes, people will stop asking Labour what it is against.

'They will want to know what Labour is for and what, if elected, it would do.’

Mr Miliband’s refusal to back welfare reforms has also proved unpopular. Taunting him recently at Prime Minister’s Questions David Cameron said Labour should change its name to the ‘Welfare Party’.

Under Mr Miliband’s leadership, support from business leaders has slipped away and the party has become increasingly reliant on funding from trade unions.

According to the latest donation figures from the Electoral Commission, unions are still providing three pounds out of four to the party.

Grant Shapps, chairman of the Conservative Party, said: ‘Until Ed Miliband breaks his overwhelming reliance on the union barons’ coffers, he cannot stand up for Britain’s hardworking people.

'Instead he can only offer the same old Labour plan of more spending, more borrowing and more debt.’
