It may not be much to look at - but it's when you're facing away from this rundown fishing hut that it really comes into its own.

The dilapidated shack boasts breathtaking sea views of one of the world's most famous beaches - a view that one buyer decided is worth £35,000.

The sum it sold for is considerably higher than the £25,000 asking price, but estate agents say this rundown 34ft by 17ft stone-walled hut which overlooks Chesil Beach on the Isle of Portland in Dorset could be the bargain of the century.

For years it has been used by a fisherman to store his nets and pots in, but should the council give the green light to allow alterations to the Grade II listed building experts say its value could shoot up to £175,000.

views over one of the world's most famous sandy strips - Chesil Beach in 
Dorset

Work needed: The 200-year-old historic Grade II listed building was sold for £35,000 which experts say could be the bargain of the
century if permission is granted by the council to convert it to a one-bedroom family 
home

The 200-year-old building also boasts magnificent views of Portland Harbour and Britain's Jurassic Coast.

Despite its restricted size its mezzanine floor could be converted into a bedroom, making the property an ideal holiday home.

Due
to the potential of the Grade II listed building, it attracted a huge 
amount of interest when it came up for auction recently.

It was eventually bought by a private buyer and it is thought they will now look to seek permission to change its use.

Jon
Summers, from Symonds and Sampson estate agents, which handled the 
sale, said: 'The property was always used as a fishing store.

'The
owners spoke to the local council about 10 years ago and they had a 
letter from them stating they would consider the property for 
conversion.

'Because of that prospect, the guide price of £25,000 and its location, it was well worth somebody taking a punt on it.

'If the new owner does get planning permission to convert it, it would be a wonderful opportunity for them.

'It would make an ideal holiday home and has stunning views of the sea out to the west of Portland.'

Little goldmine: In its present state, the building has rotting doors and windows, a fireplace, chimney, mezzanine floor and a rusty corrugated iron roof. There is also no mains water or electricity

Popular spot: It attracted a huge amount of interest when it came up

Picturesque: The Isle of Portland in Dorset is considered one of the most beautiful places in the country and the chances of planning permission being granted look good with the local council telling the former owners they would 
consider the property for conversion
