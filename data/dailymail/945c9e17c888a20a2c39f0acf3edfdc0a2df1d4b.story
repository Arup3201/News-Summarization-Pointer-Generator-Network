Lewis Hamilton prepared for this weekend's Austrian Grand Prix by hitting the gym.

The 29-year-old didn't finish in Canada just over a week and ago and needs to get back to winning ways if he is to wrestle the drivers' championship away from Nico Rosberg.

Hamilton is currently 22 points adrift of his Mercedes team-mate after the first seven races of the season.

Putting in the effort: Lewis Hamilton has hit the gym ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix this weekend

And he told his instagram followers that he is ready to launch an assault on the title.

'I've been training hard, fighting hard to win this championship! 67kg down from 73 last year,' he said, before hashtagging '#nevergiveup #letsgo #austriangp'.

Hamilton hasn't always seen eye-to-eye over the course of this season so far, but the pair looked to be in better spirits as he photobombed Rosberg earlier this month.

In a light-hearted gesture the British racer gatecrashed Rosberg's photograph with two fans in Montreal.

The picture amused the Mercedes team, who posted it to their Twitter account with the caption: 'Best... #photobomb... EVER!!! @LewisHamilton @nico_rosberg #F1 #TheMontREALdeal.'
