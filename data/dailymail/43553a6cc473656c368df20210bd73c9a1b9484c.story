Ruth Madoff has cut ties with her husband Bernie after years standing by him following his $65 billion Ponzi scheme which became the largest financial fraud in history.

Mrs Madoff, 71, has moved from Boca Raton in Florida to Old Greenwich, Connecticut to live closer to her son Andrew and his fiancee Catherine Hooper.

Three years ago, she was vilified around
the world for continuing to support her husband, Bernie Madoff, who was jailed 
for 150 years.

In a statement, she told the New York Daily News: 'I’ve moved back to the New York area for one reason: to spend time with my family, particularly Andy and my grandchildren, whom I love dearly.'

Her eldest son Mark hanged himself on the second 
anniversary of his father’s arrest in 2011.

She added: 'I lost a son whom I loved dearly. I don’t talk to Bernie anymore, and I find it so hard to reconcile my feelings for the man I was married to for over 50 years.

'Despite this, I’ve chosen to move forward with my life and focus on my remaining family, particularly my grandchildren.'

Concealed: Ruth Madoff has moved to Connecticut from Florida to be closer to her surviving son Andrew

Ruth Madoff had moved to southern 
Florida, where many of Bernie’s victims live, having lost her $7million yacht and her four 
multi-million-pound homes - in Manhattan, Long Island, the Cote d’Azur 
and Palm Beach, Florida - all auctioned off to compensate victims.

Her remaining son Andrew, 45, and his fiancée, Catherine Hooper have taken pity on her, after she initially stood by her shamed husband.

Even after his monstrous crime, Ruth Madoff was still devoted to Bernie.

She said: ‘I don’t know why. It’s a combination of 
being numb and it seeming fruitless.

'I just really miss him.
I’m lonely and he’s the only one who will ever love me like that.'

Under pressure from 
her son, who refused to see her unless she stopped visiting Bernie in prison, she finally conceded.

She had been living with her sister Joan Roman and her husband in a Florida condo until late last year, according to People magazine.

She spent her time delivering food to the elderly and infirm 
through Meals On Wheels and volunteering at a 
school in a blue-collar neighborhood, helping out in the classroom.

She finally turned her back on Bernie 
when she discovered that he had been having a long-term affair with 
Sheryl Weinstein, the CFO of a Jewish charity Hadassah which he also 
swindled.

When Ruth confronted Bernie in jail about this gross betrayal, his response was to ‘deny, deny, deny’.

‘I feel embarrassed that the thing that stopped me from going to see Bernie was not a $50billion fraud but an affair,’ she said.

‘After the terrible crime he committed, I wonder why I would care about an affair. But I do.

‘I was stunned by a 16-year affair; 
that blew me away. Going to get laid every now and then, I don’t find 
quite as bad. It’s so shameful - I can’t stand it.’

In an interview in October, Ruth Madoff said she blamed herself for her son Mark's suicide.

Mark Madoff, 46,hanged himself with a
dog leash on the second anniversary of his father Bernie Madoff's 
arrest. He had wanted his mother to cut off all contact with his father.

She said: 'It's the most awful thing that can happen to anybody- the suicide of a child.'

Anger: Andrew Madoff said he had also been angered by his mother Ruth's decision to stand by his father Bernie Madoff

Ruth and her sons barely spoke in the 
two years after his father's arrest because, Andrew Madoff said, he and 
his brother could not understand her decision to stay by their father's 
side.

The other Madoffs have always claimed to have known nothing about Bernie's Ponzi scheme.

But defrauded Madoff investors have 
long viewed the convicted swindler's sons, wife and other family member 
suspiciously, arguing it is impossible that they did not know about his 
lies. No family members have been criminally charged.
