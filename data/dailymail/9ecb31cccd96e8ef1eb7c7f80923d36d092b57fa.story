You've heard of wedding crashers. Joey DiJulio is a bachelor party crasher - of sorts.

For weeks, the father-of-one from the Seattle suburbs found himself getting emails from people he didn't know about a bachelor party 2,800 miles away in Philadelphia and a groom he's never met. 

He saw names of the city's landmarks like Reading Terminal Market thrown around in the emails but couldn't put his finger on where they were located until he searched the names online.

The wrong guest: Joey DiJulio of Burien, Washington, started receiving emails from people he had never met about a bachelor party. He then came clean about the mistake, but the groom decided to invite him anyway 

'I had no idea what any of these places are,' said DiJulio, 31, who's never been to the Northeast. 'After Googling them, everything was pointing to Philadelphia.' 

It turns out DiJulio, an information technology worker and a married father of one in Burien, Washington, had been mistaken for a friend of the groom with a similar last name. 

He sat as a 'fly on the wall' for much of the email chain until Monday, when he broke the news after the groom's brother wanted a headcount of people attending the party.

But it didn't end there. Groom Jeff Minetti, 34, figured: Why not still invite him? The Philadelphia real estate agent asked him to attend both the bachelor party March 28 and his wedding May 2 in New Jersey.

'This is the city of brotherly love,' Minetti said, even telling DiJulio he could be his best man. 'Any and all are welcome.'

The groom: When those who were invited to the bachelor party saw a picture of Joey DiJulio they said he could actually be related to the groom - Jeff Minetti 

DiJulio went online and set up a GoFundMe page to tell his story and raise money to cover his travel. 

In less than a week, he's already hit his goal of a little more than $1,200 and is putting any more money raised toward Minetti's honeymoon.

The groom promises the bachelor party will be a low-key affair at some bars, maybe a casino, to watch March Madness unfold. 

And while he won't actually get to be the best man — that's reserved for Minetti's 11-year-old cousin — DiJulio has his plane ticket ready to go for next weekend to see a city he's never been to and hang out with a group of guys he's never met.

He set up a GoFundMe page when he learned he was invited, and has since raised more than $2,000

From the groom Jeff Minetti:

People,

Has anyone else noticed now that Jeff has been rocking the beard for a while - he looks like a middle aged Pavarotti? At times, he also has ventured into a bit of hipster phase. In addition to publicly questioning his fashion choices, his bachelor party will be a good time for us to celebrate him leading up to his wedding.

Joe DiJulio finally comes clean:

Hi All,

So, I have no idea who any of you guys are, but I have been enjoying being a fly on the wall hearing about the plans for this bachelor party over the last few months.

I'm assuming my E-Mail address was added to the list by mistake (perhaps a typo of someone else?).

I live out in Seattle, WA and although for a moment I thought it might be funny to just show up and be that guy nobody knows but everyone wonders "who is that guy?", buying a plane ticket for a cross-country flight just to crash a bachelor's party might be a bit over the top (although it would be epic!).

Nonetheless, I do hope you guys have a great time and I'd like to take a moment to wish the best of luck in life to the groom!

Cheers!

Joey DiJulio

Seattle, WA

Members of the party start to reply

I say everyone forks up an extra $20 and we get Joey a plane ticket to Philly!

and

I just facebooked Joey DiJulio in WA, and if this is you - you actually look like you could be related to groom. MIND BLOWN

Mr DiJuio replies about the picture on Facebook 

Haha... Yes, that is indeed me with my (now 2-year old, she was about 3-months there) daughter, Kaylee. Speaking of bachelor parties, weddings, and the like, that shot was actually taken at a wedding for a buddy of mine who also, coincidentally, happens to now live out on the east coast (Boston). Small world!

Indeed, I think I recall seeing a picture of the groom over the last few months, and noticed this as well. I'm of course glad to know he's a studly guy - His soon-to-be-wife is a lucky woman!

PS: Still kind of a mystery to me how I got on this thread, as I've never been to PA or anywhere in the NE part of our country for that matter. But, you guys seem like a cool bunch nonetheless. Perhaps I'll have to drop you folks a line if I ever make it out there for tips on tourist-type things to check out.

The groom Joe then replies 

Joe,

I'm overnighting you a wedding invite. You show up at the bachelor party and ill make you my best man.

You can give the toast even

Jeff

He then posted an update based on the news on Facebook. A number of his friends told him to go.
