Tottenham have been accused of misleading supporters in their ongoing dispute about building a new stadium.

Archway Sheet Metal Works Ltd are standing in the way of Spurs acquiring all the land needed to start work on a new 56,000-plus capacity stadium next to White Hart Lane.

After seven years of negotiations failed to reach a conclusion, the club secured a compulsory purchase order last July forcing Archway to sell. But the company challenged the decision and it was due to be heard in the High Court on January 15.

That date was adjourned until February 17 and Tottenham released a statement last week explaining: ‘Due to the fact that not all parties were ready to proceed, the court has adjourned the hearing for a short time and this will now be heard on the 17th and 18th February 2015.’

But directors of Archway, owned by Josef Family, have hit back and accused Tottenham of being the cause of the delay.

An Archway spokesman said: ‘In view of the club’s incomplete and misleading account of the true reasons for the adjournment, we made a friendly request for a slight amendment to the news item on the their website. This was to ensure that the fans were not misled into believing that we were responsible for the delay, but Spurs refused to make that amendment.

‘Archway makes this clear statement so that Spurs fans, the news media and other interested parties are not misled as to who is responsible for this ongoing delay: clearly, Haringey Council and the secretive directors of Spurs.’

Archway insist that Tottenham did not provide information ordered by the High Court by the deadline of January 7.

Archway also claim the compulsory purchase order is ‘unlawful and unfair’ because Spurs and Haringey Council did make information public about their plans before it was granted.The spokesman added: ‘This information relates to secret discussions between the club and various public bodies concerning major changes to the club’s scheme on which the case for compulsory purchase of our land was based.’

Tottenham were hoping they would be able to move into their new stadium by the start of the 2017-18 season, but believe the delay in construction due to Archway has made that highly unlikely.

Archway, located on Paxton Road right next to White Hart Lane, went up in flames last November, prompting an investigation from the London Fire Brigade into the cause.

The company claim they have been subject to threats and abusive calls from Tottenham fans after standing firm in their stance to block the club’s plans.

Spurs are keen that their plans to start construction work and move into their new home are not delayed any further. The club insist that they were not suggesting anyone in particular was not ready to proceed with the High Court hearing and that the statement they released is correct.
