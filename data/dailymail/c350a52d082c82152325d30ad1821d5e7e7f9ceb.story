The creators of BBC police drama Happy Valley have hit back at critics to insist it is a ‘feminist’ thriller which merely reflects real life.

The programme – featuring the brutal kidnapping of a young woman by a sadistic rapist – has been accused of ‘dehumanising’ viewers by including harrowing scenes of gratuitous violence against women.

But Sally Wainwright, who wrote the six-part series, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I don’t know how to answer the question about depictions of violence against women.

BBC series Happy Valley has come in for crticism after it depicted its heroine being savagely beaten, but the creators insist the drama is 'feminist' at heart as she will 'emerge victorious'

'But a lot of violence in real life is against women. It really is aimed at women.’

Happy Valley stars Sarah Lancashire as police sergeant Catherine Cawood. Last week’s harrowing episode, the fourth of the series, ended with rapist Tommy Lee Royce, played by James Norton, attacking his own drug addict mother and then brutally beating Cawood and leaving her for dead in a cellar.

The rapist called the barely conscious officer a ‘bitch’ then told her: ‘You are going to be eating food through a straw for the rest of your life. You are going to need someone to wipe your a*** for you.’

The show’s seven million viewers know the unhinged Lee Royce is capable of any act of depravity and have already seen him drug and rape the kidnap victim and murder another female police officer by running her over in his car.

Vivienne Pattison, head of viewers campaign group Mediawatch UK, said such scenes of brutality threatened to ‘dehumanise’ viewers and ‘stunt their emotional growth’.

But Euros Lyn, who has directed three of the series’s episodes, last night insisted the programme was  a feminist drama at heart.

He said: ‘There is absolutely violence against women in this piece. There is also violence against men. But what is interesting is that this is a proper feminist thriller.

‘We have Catherine as this strong woman in her mid 40s as our heroine. As you follow her journey you see who suffers and who is the ultimate victor. You will see a woman who triumphed.’

But last week’s attack on Cawood also proved to be a tough watch for some of the show’s fans who vented their feelings on Twitter.

One wrote that they were ‘still recovering’ from the episode hours later. Another said: ‘If you weren’t on edge and your jaw wasn’t locked in down position after last night’s Happy Valley then check for brain activity.’

Devotees of the show insist that the graphic violence has not distracted from what they claim is one of the most gripping police dramas ever screened.

The BBC1 programme, set in Yorkshire’s Calder Valley, has already been tipped for Bafta success next year.
