Text messages reveal the bitter row a Pennsylvania couple had just hours before the husband returned home to murder his wife.

The text messages were used in the trial of 44-year-old David Stahl, who was found guilty on Friday of first-degree murder for strangling to death wife Rebecca, 37, in February 2012.  

While Stahl confessed to killing Rebecca, he argued he was just trying to defend himself in a physical fight instigated by his knife-wielding wife.

On February 18, the night of the murder, Rebecca sent her husband a string of angry text messages while recovering at their Greensburg home from a hysterectomy three weeks prior.

At 10:38pm on Friday, Rebecca sent a text message reading: 'You must be at the bar now. You can't just be married when you feel like it.'

'I will not be second to the bar,' she wrote five minutes later.

Rebecca, a math teacher, continued to send text messages until 11:18pm.

'Don't bother walking in here,' she wrote at one point. 'When you do come for your things, don't be nasty.'

A few hours later, Stahl returned home and the two allegedly got into a physical fight when he confronted her about smoking marijuana.

'My wife had been smoking marijuana and she was bitter, and I didn't wanna deal with it,' Stahl said in his audio-tapped confession.

Stahl says he was walking downstairs when he saw his wife waiting at the bottom, holding a knife.

'I grabbed her arm. I got the knife out of her hand, and we both fell over,' he told police.

Stahl ended up strangling his wife by trying to keep her away.

'I didn’t do this intentionally. My hands were around her neck, trying to keep her away from me. I thought she just passed out,' Stahl said.

After she died, Stahl says he lay next to Rebecca's body all night.

'I'm sorry it happened. I miss my lovebird,' he said.

But prosecutors say Stahl showed no remorse, sadness or grief at losing his wife and instead 'went to play pool and hit the bars'. An autopsy revealed he strangled Rebecca so hard he broke a bone in her neck. 

At first, Stahl hid his wife's body in a shed, before moving her to abandoned nursery.

Over the next few days, Stahl also burned his wife's belongings. 

On February 24, he dumped Rebecca's naked body in a field near the Arnold Palmer regional airport where it was soon found by police.

State Police Trooper Brian Kendgia testified during the trial, saying he found Stahl wandering the streets in distress shortly after his wife's body was recovered.

'He was muddy and looked discheveled. There were cuts on his wrists.'

Police say Stahl tried and failed to commit suicide, and was taken to the hospital for treatment. 

In his trial last week, Stahl's defense attorney Donna McClelland argued he did not commit murder, but voluntary manslaughter.

McClelland also painted Rebecca as a 'pistol' who was capable of getting into a fight with her husband.

'You don't have to like David Stahl, you don't have to respect David Stahl...but you must give him a fair trial,' she told the 12-woman jury.

However, after a few hours of deliberation, the jury found Stahl guilty of first degree murder handing down a life sentence without the possibility of parole.

Following the decision, Rebecca's brother Tom Anderson issued a statement on behalf of the family, saying his sister was 'treated like garbage at the end of her life'.

'She unfortunately gave her heart to a horrible man who apparently was not taught that a man should never hit a woman under any circumstances.'

The couple also had a history of violence. Stahl spent nine to 23 months in prison for a 2007 attack on Rebecca, who was his fiancee at the time. The attack left her with a black eye and a clump of hair pulled from her head.
