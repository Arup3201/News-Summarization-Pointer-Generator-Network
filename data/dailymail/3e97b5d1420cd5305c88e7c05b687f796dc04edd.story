Billions of dollars in U.S. taxes are going unpaid because Americans are exploiting Swiss bank accounts - and the U.S. government has failed to aggressively pursue the bank helping them to do it.

The bank, Credit Suisse, has provided accounts in Switzerland for more than 22,000 U.S. clients totaling $10 billion to $12 billion, according to a report issued by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on Tuesday.

So far the government has received only 238 names of U.S. citizens with secret accounts at Credit Suisse, or just 1 per cent of the estimated total, the investigation concluded.

Credit Suisse recruited U.S. clients between 2001 and 2008, helped them conceal the 
accounts from the Internal Revenue Service and enabled misconduct by 
bank employees, the subcommittee said.

Hidden cash: Switzerland's second largest bank, Credit Suisse, has provided accounts in Switzerland for more than 22,000 U.S. clients totaling $10 billion to $12 billion, helping them skip U.S. taxes

On Tuesday, Senator John McCain said the offshore tax practices operated by Credit Suisse and other institutions had cost US taxpayers $337.3bn in potential revenue - 'the largest amount of tax revenue lost due to evasion in the world'.

For five years, the Senate panel has been examining Swiss banks' use of secrecy laws to enable tax evasion by Americans. The main focus of its latest report was Credit Suisse.

The Senate subcommittee asserted that 
the Swiss government, with its famous banking secrecy, has continued to 
obstruct U.S. authorities' ability to learn the names of U.S. bank 
customers and former customers.

The
 report detailed cloak-and-dagger tactics used by Credit Suisse bankers 
who were said to travel to the United States to secretly service 
accounts and recruit customers - including at golf tournaments in 
Florida and the annual 'Swiss Ball' in New York.

Anger: Senator Carl Levin, the subcommittee's chairman (pictured in 2013) said the bank 'aided and abetted U.S. tax evasion' at a press conference on Tuesday

Over
 breakfast at a hotel, one banker handed a U.S. customer bank statements
 hidden in a Sports Illustrated magazine, the report said. The bank 
filed visa applications for employees that falsely portrayed them as 
tourists and maintained a New York office with lists of middlemen who 
set up offshore shell companies for some U.S. customers, the committee 
asserted.

Credit Suisse 
'aided and abetted U.S. tax evasion, not only from behind a veil of 
secrecy in Switzerland, but also on U.S. soil by sending Swiss bankers 
here to open hidden accounts,' Senator Carl Levin (D-Mich), the subcommittee's chairman, said at a news conference Tuesday.

Levin
 said the Justice Department has failed to use the U.S. legal tools with
 Credit Suisse that were used earlier to pry the names of U.S. account 
holders from No. 1 Swiss bank UBS.

Last week, ahead of the release of the Senate's report, Credit Suisse agreed to pay out $197 million to regulators after admitting to serving thousands of U.S. clients without approval.

The settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission claimed that Credit Suisse never registered cross-border securities that served 8,500 clients between 2002 and 2008. The accounts were valued at around $5. 6 billion and the bank collected $82 million in fees, it said.

Analysts have said they expect a possible settlement with the US Department of Justice following the investigation may produce an even higher fine.

It comes after seven Credit Suisse bankers were indicted in 2011. The senator's report said that neither the bank nor its bankers have yet been held accountable.

The Justice Department has instead used treaty requests for the names, relying on Swiss courts and getting stymied, he said.

'It's time to ramp up the collection of taxes due from tax evaders on the billions of dollars hidden offshore,' Levin urged.

Responding
 to the report in a statement, the Justice Department said it is 
investigating up to 14 Swiss financial institutions, 'and we won't 
hesitate to indict if and when circumstances merit'. It did not name the
 banks.

In its statement, the Justice 
Department said that since 2009, it has charged 73 account holders, and 
35 bankers and advisers with violations related to offshore tax evasion.

Justice
 officials are scheduled to testify and explain the government's actions
 at a hearing Wednesday by the subcommittee. Also expected to testify 
are four executives of Credit Suisse, including CEO Brady Dougan.

Credit Suisse has responded to the report, saying that suggestions that the bank's executives aimed to improperly report financial figures were inaccurate.

It claimed it has been 'working hard' to get rid of undeclared U.S. assets since an investigation began in 2008.

The
 spotlight on Americans' use of Swiss accounts comes amid a debate in 
Washington over whether and how to raise revenue to help reduce the 
budget deficit.

Many 
Democrats say the government is missing out on billions because 
companies are stashing profits abroad to avoid taxes. Republicans want 
to cut the corporate tax rate and ease the tax burden on money that U.S.
 companies make abroad to encourage companies to invest at home.

In the UBS case, the Justice Department threatened the bank with criminal prosecution. UBS entered a deferred prosecution agreement with the department in 2009. It agreed to pay $780 million in fines and turn over 4,400 names of customers suspected of evading U.S. taxes.

Some of those individuals have been prosecuted. Others have paid penalties and back taxes under an IRS voluntary disclosure program that lets those who come forward pay less than they owe.

The program has resulted in 43,000 taxpayers coming forward about their offshore accounts and paying $6 billion in back taxes, interest and penalties, according to the government.

But Justice has failed to pursue most of the UBS account holders and hasn't actively pursued Credit Suisse, Levin and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the panel's senior Republican, said at the news conference.

Credit Suisse disclosed in 2011 that it was the target of a criminal investigation by Justice. Credit Suisse and UBS are on a list of 29 'global systemically important banks' whose failures would be considered a threat to the entire financial system.

Credit Suisse shares fell 3.165 to 27.31 Swiss francs in Zurich on Wednesday.
