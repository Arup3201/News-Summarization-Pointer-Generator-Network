Rio Ferdinand may be attracting offers from the likes of LA Galaxy to go to the MLS next season but he remains intent on taking his first steps into coaching.

MLS franchises are continuing to look for star names to lift the game's profile and the possibility of taking the same steps as Ryan Nelsen also appeals to Ferdinand.

The 35-year-old is ready to leave United at the end of the season but is considering retiring from playing and concentrate on getting his coaching badges.

Hanging up his boots? Rio Ferdinand is intent on moving into coaching at the end of this season

In and out: Injury has disrupted Ferdinand's season at Old Trafford under new manager David Moyes

He began his courses more than three years ago but had to stop when a back injury needed his full attention.

He has picked up where he left off this season and intends to gain the first stage of his qualifications by the summer when he is also likely to begin TV work helping with coverage of the World Cup.

United are scouring the market for replacements for Ferdinand.

They have studied the much-touted Eliaquim Mangala at Porto but have doubts he is really at the level they require, while have an admiration for Kurt Zouma but suspect he has already agreed to join Chelsea - either this week or in the summer.

Not up to it: Eliaquim Mangala (left) of Porto is not considered of the required quality by Man United

Tied up: United like the look of St Etienne's Kurt Zouma (left), but feel a deal is already in place with Chelsea

Weak link: David Moyes has also ruled out a bid for Dante because he does not think he's good enough

Dante at Bayern Munich has been mentioned but David Moyes is well schooled on German football and knows Pep Guardiola sees the Brazilian as one of his weaker links, as underlined by Manchester City's attack in their Champions League tie in Munich.

At 30 too, a deal does not represent great business for Moyes, who is building a new era.

Southampton's Luke Shaw is a player Moyes is happy to bid £20m-plus for but United have been told the 18-year-old is not for sale at any price this window.

Four way battle: United are ready to contest the signing of Southampton's Luke Shaw with Man City, Chelsea and Liverpool

Jose Mourinho is again favourite to sign the boyhood Chelsea fan, although Manchester City and Liverpool have asked to be kept informed.

One Ferdinand we could yet be seeing more of on these shores, however, is Anton. The younger Ferdinand brother is keen on a return to England as his move to Turkish club Antalyaspor has turned sour with the 28-year-old making just a handful of appearances since joining from QPR.

Combative: Stoke boss Mark Hughes is set to revive his interest in Sunderland's Lee Cattermole

Admirer: Hughes is also set to pursue a move for Sunderland striker Steven Fletcher

Stoke to return for Sunderland's combative Cattermole?

Stoke City are ready to revive interest in Sunderland midfielder Lee Cattermole and may look to take Steven Fletcher too.

The combative Cattermole spoke at the weekend about how much he was looking forward to appearing in the Capital One Cup final for Sunderland against Manchester City yet Gus Poyet has to take stock of how such a transfer can aid his team going forward and more pertinently survive in the Premier League.

Cattermole, 25, has made 19 appearances this season in all competitions and 14 last year. His disciplinary record has improved massively but Poyet feels it is a deal he can afford to do if he can bring in Liam Bridcutt from Brighton and Ever Banega on loan from Valencia.

In turn, should Cattermole go through to Stoke, Norwich may revisit a deal for Stoke's Glenn Whelan.Sunderland recalled Connor Wickham from his loan at Sheffield Wednesday today after interest from Stoke in Fletcher.    ........................................................................................................................................................

Done: Auxerre's Paul Georges-Ntep should finallise his move to Queens Park Rangers in the coming days

Nottingham Forest are keen on Wickham, too, and also want Sunderland's Danny Graham and David Vaughan. Poyet may yet decide to keep Wickham himself for the relegation run-in. Wednesday may turn to Hull City's Matty Fryatt.

Georges-Ntep expected to complete QPR move shortly

Paul Georges-Ntep should finalise his move from Auxerre to QPR in the next few days. The France U21 forward has been in discussions over a £2million move for the past few weeks.

Several Premier League sides have shown an interest as have French side Rennes but most wanted a deal in the summer.

Harry Redknapp could find himself a bargain and will look to team him with Ishak Belfodil of Inter Milan who is due to have a medical on Tuesday.
