Detectives investigating sexual abuse at one of Britain's top music schools have today said more than 30 women have come forward since a former pupil killed herself after suffering years of abuse.

A major investigation was launched in February following the conviction 
of ex-choirmaster at Chetham's School of Music, Michael Brewer, who indecently assaulted former pupil Frances 
Andrade.

Ms Andrade, who was 48, took a fatal overdose during his trial, and officers say since then other women have been 'spurred 
on' by her bravery and contacted the police.

Greater Manchester Police has also revealed 
they 'are currently investigating a pool of about 10 offenders', some of whom 
are former teachers.

Detectives believe they are making 'good progress' on their major probe into abuse at the school

Detective Chief Inspector Jamie Daniels, from GMP's Protective Services Division, said: 'This is a significant inquiry in terms of potential number of offenders and number of victims.

'We are supporting each and every person who has come forward and made a complaint to us as best we can and I must credit them all for having the courage to face demons that have been haunting them for many, many years.

'This has been a high-profile investigation from the off and due to the complexities and sensitivities involved cannot and will not be rushed.

'I want to reassure the public that I am absolutely committed to getting justice for these women, many of whom have been spurred on by the bravery shown by Frances Andrade in the case against former teacher Michael Brewer.

'I also want to reassure everybody, that where we have identified immediate safeguarding concerns the appropriate steps have been taken in partnership with other organisations.

'Chetham's and other establishments have provided, and continue to provide help and support at what is clearly a very difficult time for their respective staff and pupils.

'It goes without saying that if anyone has been a victim of any offence or has any information that can assist this investigation I would urge them to get in touch.'

Probe: More than 30 former female pupils of Chetham's School of Music (pictured) have reported abuse to police

Nearly all of the abuse is alleged to have taken place at Chetham’s - however it is believed some took place when complainants were pupils at the Royal Northern College of Music, also in Manchester.

The allegations came to light after the trial of former Chetham’s choirmaster Michael Brewer, convicted earlier this year of indecent assault in the 1970s and 1980s.

A second music teacher, Wen Zhou Li, a 57-year-old violin tutor from Cheshire who has worked at both Chetham’s and the RNCM, has also been arrested on suspicion of rape before being released on bail. No charges have been brought and Mr Li strenuously denies the allegations.

Paul Lewis, an acclaimed pianist who studied at Chetham’s in the 1980s, claimed ‘every pupil’ knew of the abuse.

Malcolm Layfield, who was head of strings at the Royal Northern College of Music, was accused by Frances Andrade of preying on students.

He said he had resigned from the Manchester-based college as his position was ‘untenable’.

Married Mr Layfield, 61, taught at Chetham’s alongside Brewer. He has admitted sexual relationships with at least six pupils, some of whom were just 16.

It was stated all the girls were over the age of consent and the ‘liaisons’ were ‘consensual’.

More than 1,000 former Chetham’s pupils and professional musicians signed a petition calling for an independent inquiry into sexual abuse at the school and other private music conservatoires.
