A Melbourne man has posted an advertisement for a haunted chair on eBay.

Andre Williams from Croydon in Melbourne picked up the wicker chair from hard rubbish two years ago and is hoping to sell it for $666.

In the eBay advertisement, he describes the chair as a 'Vintage 1900s cane chair haunted by [a] poltergeist'.

A chair that is 'haunted by a poltergeist' has been advertised for sale on eBay by a Melbourne seller

'After a week of having it in the house, I heard some crying during the night (I thought I was dreaming),' he writes in the item description.

'Then in the morning I noticed that the chair was on its side. I didn't connect the dots until it happened several times over two years.

'Sometimes there is laughing accompanied by tapping noises… the chair is always in a different spot afterwards (moves up to three metres) leaving shallow dent marks across the floor.'

The advertisement also said the chair had 'severe scratch marks' on the arms 'like someone has been aggressively dragging their fingernails'.

Mr Williams wrote that some repair work had been done on the piece, but it was not fully restored because he was 'too afraid to touch the chair'.

The seller wrote on the item description that he frequently found the chair on its side after hearing crying and tapping

Bidding for the chair starts at $25 and the buy-it-now price is $666

'I would be glad to get rid of it and pass it on to someone who has had experience with this kind of thing. Please help!!!’

The opening bid for the chair is set at $25, though a keen purchaser can buy it now for $666.

As yet there have been no bids placed on the item, but 16 people are watching it and the advertisement gets more than 100 views a day.

Mr Williams, who is an artist, told Daily Mail Australia that the advertisement 'was meant to be a bit of theatre’.

'People get so caught up in [supernatural things] that they want to make it true, they believe what they want to believe. It was a bit of experiment in human behaviour and human psychology,’ he said.

Mr Williams says that if the chair does not sell he will reinvent the chair as something else and list it again.

'That could be fun, the changing personality of this chair.’
