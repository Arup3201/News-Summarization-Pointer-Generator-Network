The parents of a Texas Little League pitcher have filed a million-dollar lawsuit after their 12-year-old son was hit in the face during a line drive by a player who they claim used an altered bat.

Emmett Parsutt Jr. was starting pitcher for the Santa Fe All-Stars during the July 1 game against the League City All-Stars.

In the fifth inning, the ball struck the child in the head with 'tremendous force - far beyond that of a regulation bat - and injured him, ' the lawsuit claims.

Through-out the game, which League City won 8-0, suspicions arose that the rival team was using an illegal metal bat.

'The
umpire, when I was walking around, said something sounds funny on the 
bat they're using, the ball is coming off really, really different,' 
Bryan Alexander, the manager of Emmett's team, told KHOU 11 News. 'We started noticing everyone on the team was using the same bat.'

When
Parsutt's parents and coaches ran to help him, a League City parent 
took the bat to the parking lot and locked it in his car, the suit 
alleges, then refused requests to let others examine it.

At
that point, Texas City police were called, and the child was taken off 
the field on a stretcher then rushed to hospital in an ambulance.

He still suffers eye twitches and headaches and will have to sit out the rest of the season. He said himself, he noticed something askew about the other team's bat.

'I thought I was throwing a good game,' Parsutt Jr. told KHOU. 'They just kept hitting it and then I took the line drive.'

His father Emmett Parsutt Sr. watched the ball strike his son.

'I didn't know how severe his injury was, so I was just by his side,' Parsutt Sr. said.

The family is now suing both League City Little League and Little League Baseball.

A Little League official told KHOU the offending bat was sent to League headquarters in Williamsport, Pensylvania, where it was determined and confirmed by the manufacturer to have not been altered in any way.

The family's attorney, Charles McMillan, suspects foul play, and claims the bat that was sent away wasn't the one used in the offending line drive.

'We know Little League International has done an investigation on a bat. We just don't know what bat it was,' McMillan said.

The president of League City Little League said the bat had been used all season long without any trouble.
