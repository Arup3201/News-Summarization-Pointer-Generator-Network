Deryck Green, 66 blew more than £400,000 on prostitutes, stealing from the Post Office to fund his habit

A sex addict who spent more than £400,000 on prostitutes has been jailed for stealing to fund his habit.

Postal clerk Deryck Green, 66, stole £28,000 from the sub post office where he worked - and which his wife managed - and spent it on prostitutes costing up to £160-an-hour.

He turned to crime to fund his addiction after blowing around £305,000 from the sale of his home on hookers, and ended up another £100,000 in debt before being caught out.

He covered up his misdemeanours by falsifying his accounts.

Green was jailed for 17 months after being found guilty of theft and false accounting, following a week-long trial.

He had attempted to kill himself by taking sleeping pills before he was sentenced leaving a suicide note titled ‘Live Fast, Love Hard, Die Young’.

Guilford Crown Court heard that the self-confessed sex addict, of Longbridge Deverill near Warminster, Wiltshire, helped himself to a total of £28,000 to fund his seedy lifestyle.

Green turned to crime after selling his matrimonial home for £305,000 ten years ago - splashing the profits on prostitutes and then racking up another £100,000 of debts.

He then stole cash from the post office section of Martins newsagents in Esher, Surrey, where his wife was manager, between December 2008 and September 2009.

Susannah Bramley, prosecuting, said he resorted to making electronic cash transfers to a till that was hardly ever checked to hide his deception.

She said Green stole £28,000 until his dishonesty was spotted.

Ms Bramley said: 'In an attempt to hide the thefts, he falsified records on his computer.

'Unfortunately for Mr Green, the Post Office decided to do an internal audit on a day when he wasn’t working.'

When interviewed by his bosses, Green offered to confess - but later threatened to 'discredit' the Post Office and Martins, by publicising a loophole in their system.

After being found guilty of theft and false accounting and released on bail, Green attempted suicide on the day he was originally supposed to be sentenced.

He was found unconscious and taken to hospital suffering from a drugs overdose.

Green had written a defiant 'suicide note' which dealt with his fondness for fast living and his taste for sex sessions with prostitutes, Judge Neil Stewart told the court.

The judge told Green: 'Your conduct was cynical, deliberate and dishonest.'

Green was brought to court in custody for sentencing after spending two weeks at Salisbury Hospital.

Anthony Mitchell, defending, said: 'He had taken 190 tablets of a prescribed drug.'

Mr Mitchell said Green and his wife - who had also been admitted to Salisbury Hospital following a suspected stroke - were in debt to the tune of £100,000.

He told the court: 'My client had been addicted to sex and the use of prostitutes. He was spending between £100 an hour to £160 an hour on prostitutes.

'He ran out of money, which led him into the criminal offences for which he now appears before the court.'

Mr Mitchell described Green’s relationship with his wife as 'slightly strained'.
