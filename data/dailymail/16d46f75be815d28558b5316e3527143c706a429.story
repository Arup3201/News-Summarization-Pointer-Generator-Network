Fightback: Defence minister Anna Soubry denied using the C-word and threatened to sue the Mail

It was supposed to be a warts and all documentary showing what really goes on in the corridors of power.

But the most explosive part of the fly-on-the-wall film about the inner workings of Parliament was yesterday dramatically edited out amid claims it showed a Tory minister shout an obscenity at Ed Miliband.

Anna Soubry threatened legal action and issued a furious denial just hours before the final episode of Inside The Commons was to air on BBC Two last night.

A comment that sounded like 'sanctimonious c***' was shouted at the Labour leader during a Commons debate last June. It appeared to come from the direction of the defence minister but she said this suggestion was 'outrageous'.

The heckling was recorded by programme maker Michael Cockerell during filming in the chamber shortly after the Queen set out the Government's agenda.

In a preview tape seen by journalists, Mr Cockerell said: 'Official television coverage, even though it is heavily restricted, has fuelled public antagonism to MPs.

'But our cameras have witnessed the unsanitised version in which MPs sometimes use the most offensive language.'

Miss Soubry could then be clearly seen and heard on the back row of the Tory benches heckling Mr Miliband. A publicist working for the production company behind the film emailed journalists on Monday claiming Miss Soubry had sworn.

Miss Soubry, 58, was alerted and denied that she had used the word. The BBC then removed the sound of the heckling from the programme and the reference to the 'most offensive language'.

Instead in his narration, Mr Cockerell referred to 'behaviour even rougher than is usually seen.'

When told about the allegation by the Mail, Miss Soubry said she planned to contact her solicitor and the Commons Speaker. 

Footage: Presenter Michael Cockerell's voiceover to this footage of a Commons debate was changed, cutting out a reference to 'most offensive language'. Instead he cited 'behaviour even rougher than is usually seen'

She insisted: 'I can absolutely assure you I have never used language like that. I would never use language like that and most certainly not in the House of Commons, nor against any opponent. 

'There is no way, I am telling you now, with the volume of my voice, that I would, even if I was minded to, which I am not. I abhor the word.

'Never ever. That word is never used in the House. Outrageous.'

Miss Soubry, who has been reprimanded by Speaker John Bercow for behaviour in the Commons, said the debating chamber was noisy, but foul language was never used.

When offered the opportunity by the Mail to view the footage, Miss Soubry said she had 'more important things' to do.

The BBC refused to comment on whether it had come under any pressure from Miss Soubry, her solicitor, the Ministry of Defence or the Conservative Party.

Denial: Michael Cockerell denied any knowledge of the scene and said the BBC had editorial control

Mr Cockerell yesterday declined to talk about the scene when contacted by the Mail and even claimed to have no knowledge of its existence. He said: 'I don't know what you're talking about. I don't recognise what you're talking about. Anything you're talking about is not in the programme.

'The BBC has editorial control and they make the decisions on the way the programme is cut.'

Miss Soubry, who once described herself as 'not a girl but a tough old bird', worked as a TV journalist before becoming a barrister.

She was elected as Tory MP for Broxtowe, Notts, at the last election in 2010. In 2013, she apologised to Ukip leader Nigel Farage after making lewd remarks about him.

There is no list of banned swear words in the Commons, but terms deemed to be unparliamentary language according to the rule book include: pharisee, swine, jackass, hooligan, blackguard, cad, ruffian and insulting dog.

In November communities minister Penny Mordaunt apologised for using a Commons speech on animal welfare to say obscene words after a dare at a dinner with Navy friends.

A BBC spokesman said: 'Changes can and are often made to the final version broadcast, as is the case with this episode.'

Anna Soubry: 'It is very important that you run this past your lawyers because you will not defame me'

I beg your pardon. I can be heard saying what? No. Absolutely not. Never. Never. And if you print that I will sue you because I would never. 

The C-word? No absolutely not, I would never use that word and I would never use it in the House of Commons and I would certainly never use it… I'm not having that. I can absolutely assure you I have never used language like that and I can equally assure you on the back row nobody, we wouldn't think of shouting a word like that, the foulest word.

I'm now going to ring both the press office here and at HQ, and I'm going to ring my solicitor. I would never say that and that's an extremely, extremely serious allegation. Never ever. That word is never used in the House. Outrageous.

Forgive me because I need to make a number of phone calls, because I'm not having that. I would never use language like that and most certainly not in the House of Commons, nor against any opponent. I don't use that word so you better not print it.

There is no way, I am telling you now, with the volume of my voice that I would, even if I was minded to, which I am not. I abhor the word. There is no way. You guys should know this. You couldn't shout out language like that.

No, I'm sorry. End of debate.

I would never use that word.

I know that I do not use that word and if you print that I will bloody sue you because I would never use that word. I'm going to go to the Speaker. If there's one person, well more than one, that the Speaker would be listening to, it's the likes of me.

You heard me use the word c*** in the House of Commons? No sir. Never. Because I do not use it in my ordinary life and I would never use it in the House of Commons and I am profoundly offended at the suggestion I ever would. I just don't use that word and anyone will tell you that because I'm an old feminist who hates that word. If there's word I loathe. it's that word.

And the idea I would call anybody in the House of Commons, I don't use the word anyway, it's just inconceivable, I don't do that. I am sorry I absolutely don't. You can hear how strongly I feel.

You're telling me you've heard me use the C-word.

You really are certain?

I do not use the C-Word. Come on. You know how that place operates, you don't sit and shout out foul language. Nobody does.

I think it is very important that you run this past your lawyers because you will not defame me, sir. You will absolutely not. I would never dream shouting out the C-word of all words.

The one thing you never do is shout out foul language. You don't behave like that. We're noisy and I don't say we're not, but we don't use foul language.

I put my hands up when I do something wrong, but I'm not having this. I would never do that.

I'm not having it. This is a very serious allegation.

I can assure you I do not use the C-word and I certainly do not swear in the House of Commons. None of us do. I know some people don't like our antics, but we do not. You wouldn't. It's inconceivable.

You better not defame me, I will have you, and I mean that.

Do forgive me, goodbye.
