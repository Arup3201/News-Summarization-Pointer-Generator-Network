The end of major roadworks is always a cause for celebration.

Residents on one street, who had suffered disruption and delays for 19 months, were so delighted that the work was finally complete they threw a party.

They adorned Chilwell Road in Nottingham with bunting, blew up balloons and set up the children’s face painting stall, while local businesses stocked up in preparation for a busy weekend. 

But the street’s jubilant mood soon fell flat – when it turned out the roadworks were not finished after all.

Residents of the street in Nottingham were dismayed to learn the road works would be going on for another month (file image) 

The project to extend the city’s tram network was already nearly a year behind schedule – with the road originally due to reopen shortly after Christmas 2013. The work, which was meant to be completed in time for the party on Saturday, will now not be finished until the end of November.

Julie Cameron, 50, owns a gift shop on the street, which she spent last week painting and decorating in preparation for the grand reopening. 

She said she will now only have a few weeks to sell £10,000 worth of Christmas stock.

She added: ‘Everyone has been putting the bunting out for the full opening and we have been stitched up again. What are we all celebrating for if it is basically still closed?

‘I am so upset and now really worried about the future of my business. Christmas trade is make or break for many of the businesses down here ... we used to have 2,000 cars a day coming down here and for the last 18 months we haven’t had two.’

The street has been disrupted for more than a year with building works underway for the city's tramline 

Contractor Taylor Woodrow Alstom apologised for the inconvenience, saying the latest delay was due to work on the water mains.

A spokesman said: ‘Every effort is being made to ensure that the remaining works do not take any longer than necessary.’

But local Tory MP Anna Soubry described the lack of communication as ‘dreadful’.
