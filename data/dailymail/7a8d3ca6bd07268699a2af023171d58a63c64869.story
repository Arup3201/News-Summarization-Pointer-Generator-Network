Bode Miller has defended NBC's Christin Cooper after her finishing-line 
interview with him left him in tears after she asked about his late 
brother, Chelone.

Addressing the backlash against Cooper for 
appearing to make Miller cry after his bronze-medal in the super-G race 
in Sochi on Sunday, the skier claimed that she was simply doing her job.

'My
 emotions were very raw, she asked the questions that every interviewer 
would have, pushing is part of it, she wasn't trying to cause pain,' 
wrote Miller on Twitter about the experienced NBC interviewer.

The NBC reporter has faced a furious stream of abuse on social media for pushing Miller to answer questions about Chelone, 29, who died in April last year from a seizure.

'I appreciate everyone sticking up for me. Please be gentle w (sic) Christin Cooper, it was crazy emotional and not all her fault,' added Miller about Cooper's line of questioning in the immediate aftermath of his third place - which made him the most medaled skier in history and the oldest person to win an alpine medal at the Games.

Miller was the first to bring up his brother, Chilly, a snowboarder who died in April from a seizure, but Cooper continued to push to the point that he had to walk away.

However, this morning on the Today show, Miller told host Matt Lauer, that Cooper was not at fault.

'I have known Christin a long time, and she's a sweetheart of a person,' told Lauer.

'I know she didn't mean to push. I don't think she really anticipated what my reaction was going to be, and I think by the time she realized it, it was too late. I don't blame her at all.'

Cooper pressed Miller on his brother well after Miller became visibly emotional.

As Miller began to cry, Cooper asked if his performance was for Chilly. He struggled but managed to answer the question, saying that it wasn't for him but he wanted to make himself proud.

But then she asked whether he had been talking to his brother when he looked up at the sky before the start of the race.

This became too much for him causing him to fully break down, hunched over before walking away.

Finally, his wife, professional volleyball player Morgan Miller, arrived to comfort him.

'I feel terrible that she's taking the heat for that because it really was just a heat-of-the-moment kind of circumstance,' Miller said.

'I don't think there was any harm intended. It was just a lot of emotion for me.

'It's been a lot over the past year. You sometimes don't realize how much you can contain that stuff until the dam breaks, and then it's just a real outpouring.'

Twiter backlash: Twitter erupted with criticism for Cooper, with most saying she was too aggressive

Twitter erupted with criticism for Cooper, with most saying she was too aggressive.

'NBC has NO shame. How many times do they need to make Bode Miller cry for his dead brother to promote their ratings,' one user wrote while another tweeted,'Some announcers just don't know when to stop asking questions-why can't they leave Bodie Miller alone and let him deal with his emotions.'

But Miller chimed in on Twitter, somewhat defending the journalist, who was previously a skier before getting the TV gig.

'I appreciate everyone sticking up for me. Please be gentle w christin cooper, it was crazy emotional and not all her fault. #heatofthemoment' he wrote.

He then added: 'My emotions were very raw, she asked the questions that every interviewer would have, pushing is part of it, she wasn't trying to cause pain.'

The win was the 36-year-old's sixth career Olympic medal, spread over 12 years, and now has sole possession of second place on the all-time men's Alpine medal list.

As well as the death of his younger brother, Miller has been fighting for custody of his infant son and working to come back from left knee surgery and return to the Alpine apex.

'To be on the podium, it's a really big day for me,' said Miller, who placed eighth in downhill and sixth in super-combined. 'Emotionally, I had a lot riding on it. I'm super, super happy.'

Wife Morgan has been with him every step of the way and was the first to congratulate him after his latest medal success. She was also quick to praise her husband's achievements and his resilience.

'After the year we've had, and the fact we just keep pushing through it,' she said, 'it just shows how resilient Bode is.'

Chilly was a charismatic snowboarder who was 29 and hoping to make the U.S. team in Sochi when he died of what was believed to be a seizure.

'Everything felt pretty raw and pretty connected,' Miller said, 'so it was a lot for me.'

Later he took to Twitter to honor his brother: 'Thanks for all the support, today was one of the most emotional days of my life. I miss my brother.'

Gold in the event was taken by Norwegian Kjetil Jansrud, 28. It was his country's fourth straight super-G gold, and fifth in the past seven Winter Games.

American Andrew Weibrecht, charged late at Jansrud's time of 1 minute, 18.14 seconds to take a surprise silver, edging teammate Miller and Jan Hudec of Canada into a tie for bronze.
