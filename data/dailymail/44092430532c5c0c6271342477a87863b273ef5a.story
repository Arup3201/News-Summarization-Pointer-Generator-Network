Former Swansea defender Chico Flores seems to be bathing in his own success after posting a Twitter picture of himself in a tub shared with an unknown lady.

At best, the Spanish centre-back appears to be using the woman's painted toes as a makeshift chin rest as he reclines covered in bubbles, while few could argue with the accompanying caption that simply reads 'Relax'.

Flores left the Premier League in the summer to be re-united with former Swans manager Michael Laudrup at Qatari Stars League champions Lekhwiya.

The 27-year-old was joined by teammate Pablo Hernandez, with the pair arriving in the Middle East for undisclosed fees after two-year spells at the Liberty Stadium.

'Chico' made 75 appearances for Swansea after signing from Italian club Genoa and helped the club to Capital One Cup trophy success in 2013.

'It feels like I am leaving my family,' Chico said.

'I have really enjoyed my time here. When we won the cup it was one of the best moments in my career.'
