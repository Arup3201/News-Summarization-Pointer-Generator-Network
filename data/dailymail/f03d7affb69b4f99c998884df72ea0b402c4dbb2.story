The Miami strip club that lost its license in the wake of allegations that a 13-year-old sex slave had been forced to perform under the stage name Peaches has filed an injunction to get re-opened.

Miami Beach city manager Jimmy Morales suspended Club Madonna's business permits for six months on Friday, while police investigate the circumstances around how a 13-year old girl was able to get a job dancing at the fully nude strip club.

But club owner Leroy Griffith has refused to take the decision lying down and on Tuesday went to federal court to file an injunction against the city.

Club Madonna in Miami Beach had its business permits suspended for six months on Friday, while police investigate the circumstances around how a 13-year old girl was able to get a job dancing at the fully nude strip club

The nine-count complaint seeks an immediate injunction to get the club re-opened and monetary damages based on the club’s out-of-pocket losses, attorney Richard Wolfe said.

Last week authorities said they had arrested three people on human trafficking charges after they had forced a 13-year-old runaway girl to dance at the all-nude strip club.

When quizzed about the allegations, Griffith said he had no proof that the victim had ever danced at his club.

‘Based on the gravity of recent allegations, the evidence collected and the owner’s admitted failure to have the required knowledge of what illegal activity occurs at Club Madonna, I have determined that this activity presents an actual threat to the public health, welfare and safety of the public,’ Morales said.

He didn't know: Club owner Leroy Griffith says there is no record of the girl working at the club, and that he didn't know she was dancing on his stage

On Tuesday, Wolfe said the club’s closure ‘was done in a punitive, vindictive manner.’

‘They didn’t comply with their own requirements set forth in the city code. The city code requires them to determine that there’s an emergency that will cause a serious danger to the citizens of Miami Beach. That didn’t occur,’ Wolfe told NBC.

Griffith still maintains that what happened involving the 13-year-old girl was a one-time incident, if indeed it occurred.

‘But if this girl did dance, she danced, it’s an isolated instance, it’s not indicative of the manner in which this club has operated lawfully for 40 years, and proper safeguards have been put in place to make sure it would never happen again,’ Wolfe said.

‘The city manager was overreaching in the manner in which he shut down the business with the stroke of a pen.’

The accused: (L to R) DeWayne Ward, 18, Marlene San Vincente, 22, and Vilbert Jean, 36, were arrested last week

City spokeswoman Nannette Rodriguez said the city stands by Morales’ comments from Friday.

Griffith, who has owned Madonna for 40 years ago, claims he was on a New Year's cruise during the time period that the minor worked at the club, and his head manager, on the job only two months, was also on holiday.

Dancers at the club are supposed to sign contracts and provide identification to prove that they’re at least 18 years old, which is then kept on file.

He told the Miami Herald he has neither for the 13-year-old and that she provided the manager on duty with ID that proved she was 18.

According to police, however, the girl claimed the club's managers never asked her for anything to verify her age.

The girl told police she worked the club on Dec. 27 and 28 and Jan. 2, 3 and 4. Each night she was forced to turn over her earnings, ranging from $120 to $500 a night.

Police have executed search warrants and 
collected the club's video tapes and other evidence to determine whether
 the girl actually did take the stage and whether she performed lap 
dances.

The three people accused of forcing the young runaway into a life of sex slavery after scooping
her up off a Miami Beach street last month are Vilbert Jean, 36, Marlene San Vincente, 22, and DeWayne
Ward, 18.

The trio forced her to have sex for money on at least one
occasion, before forcing her to strip at Club Madonna on the South Beach Strip,
according to an affidavit cited by the Miami Herald.

The girl, identified only as D.J. in the affidavit, was held
against her will by the gun-toting trio and plied with drugs and alcohol,
police said in the report. She ran away from home and was reported missing on
December 10.

She and two 15-year-old friends shacked up at a seedy motel
in North Miami. They soon met a man referred to only as AP, he brought them to
a nearby home.

The two other girls were dismissed for being too young, but
D.J. insisted she was 18, said the report.

Ward had sex with the teen at least six times and she was
also forced to have sex with a man at a motel for $80, the affidavit said.

Her captors did not give her any of the money, and forced
her to strip when she railed against having sex for money, the report said.

Ms San Vicente, who already danced for cash at the all-nude
club, forced her to spend her nights on stage, according to the affidavit.

The minor was given ‘exotic clothing’ by the woman, she even
had her hair and nails done - she sometimes made as much as $500 a night.

The trio reportedly took all of it. They also held her
hostage with an AK-47 assault rifle, a .40-caliber handgun and threatened her
with bodily harm, police alleged.

The girl told police she worked the club on Dec. 27 and 28 and Jan. 2, 3 and 4 earning between $120 and $500 a night

The firearms and large amounts of marijuana and alcohol were
recovered from the home after the girl managed to escape last week and her
mother called police, according to CBS Miami.

Authorities have not arrested any other club employees, but
say in the arrest report that the girl was never asked to provide proof of her
age.

‘The minor victim was never asked, nor did she ever provide
the Madonna club management any identification to verify her age,’ cops said.

The club's attorney said there is no evidence
the girl ever worked at Madonna.

‘We have no record of her signing in,’ said Wolfe.
‘We have no payroll record of her working. All the other girls signed
contracts, we have no contract from this girl.’

Hostage: The young girl was held against her will, forced to have sex with Mr Ward multiple times, threatened with violence and drugged in this home, police say

Club owner Griffith also said he had no idea the girl
was at the club.

‘What happened to us is one of the dancers called up and
said ‘I’m going to come back and dance. Can I bring a friend?’ he told the
Herald. ‘You know, there are 40 or 50 girls walking in and out of the club.’

Though he doesn’t recall the girl working in his club,
authorities say she was on stage from Dec 13 to Jan 4, he lamented the young
girl’s plight.

‘I feel bad about it,’ the club owner told Local 10. ‘We're
having meetings about it right now.’

The club was fully cooperating with police.

‘We’re working with them, we want to get to the bottom as
much as you do,’ Griffith told CBS Miami.

Each of the three has been charged with human trafficking,
lewd and lascivious conduct on a person under 16, delivering a controlled
substance to a person under 18 and contributing to the delinquency of a minor

They are being held in Dade County Jail. The young girl is back with her family.
