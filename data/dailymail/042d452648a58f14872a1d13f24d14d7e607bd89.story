A 26-year-old man arrested at London Heathrow Airport earlier this month was tonight charged with taking part in the kidnapping of two European photographers in Syria, police said.

Dutch photographer Jeroen Oerlemans and his British colleague John Cantlie were taken hostage on July 17 while working near the Syrian border with Turkey, and were released on July 26.

Shajul Islam, who was arrested last Tuesday after arriving from Egypt, was charged with imprisoning the men against their will and is scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court tomorrow.

It came after a 26-year-old woman arrested at Heathrow with him was released without charge. The pair were arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.

Mr Cantlie, who had worked for the Sunday Times, and Mr were both held hostage for a week in July. Mr Cantlie later said that one of his captors had claimed to be an NHS doctor.

He told the Daily Mail that treating badly injured fighters in Syria would be good training for when he returned to the UK because he wanted to specialise in trauma.

Mr Cantlie said: ‘I asked for 
his help... but he refused to even send a text to my girlfriend to say 
we were alive. He said he would be beheaded if he did.

Counter terrorism investigators are increasingly concerned about foreign nationals with more extremist mindsets travelling to Syria to support jihadi movements.

The charge alleges Islam, with others, unlawfully and injuriously imprisoned Mr Cantlie and Mr Oerlemans against their will, contrary to common law and section 63B of the Terrorism Act 2000.

Anti-terror legislation gives police up to a week to question suspects without charge.
