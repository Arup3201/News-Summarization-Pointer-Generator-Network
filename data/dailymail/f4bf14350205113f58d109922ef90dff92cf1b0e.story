Council house tenants will be given taxpayer-funded grants of £30,000 or more to help them buy any home under a new government scheme.

The money will help them move out of their council house and buy a home somewhere else. Some £84million will be made available over two years.

The Right to Buy Social Mobility Fund is aimed at older people who want to downsize or move closer to family.

The Right to Buy Social Mobility fund will give £84million away in the next two years. Among those eligible are people who need to move to find a job or those who want to downsize

Workers who want to move to find a job and tenants who can't get a mortgage for the property they are living in will also be eligible. 

It will be open to residents who could otherwise buy the council house in which they live under the Right to Buy scheme.

The Government said it wanted to help council house tenants 'trapped in social housing'.

Individual grants will total £20,000 for people living outside London and £30,000 in the capital – but these can be topped up with more money from councils.

Under the Right to Buy scheme, tenants living somewhere for five years are eligible for discounts of up to £77,000 outside London and £102,700 in London when purchasing the home where they live.

The average discount is around £45,000 off the price of the property.

A document issued yesterday by the Department for Communities and Local Government invited councils to submit bids for the new fund.

It said: 'Some social tenants who are able to afford to exercise their Right to Buy are prevented from doing so because the social property in which they live is not suitable for their needs, or is difficult to mortgage.

'Older tenants may wish to move to a different area to be closer to family or into more suitable accommodation; working age tenants may want to move closer to employment opportunities; and some tenants struggle to get a mortgage, for example because they live in a property of non-standard construction.'

'The Government wants to help tenants trapped in social housing as a result of these barriers to access home ownership.'
