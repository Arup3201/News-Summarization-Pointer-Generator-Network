There have been times when Ryan Mason has made an instant impression. Micky Hazard knew it when he first saw him play aged seven.

‘It was the football brain,’ said Hazard, the former Tottenham midfielder who whisked Mason straight off to White Hart Lane.

Mauricio Pochettino was quickly on to it, too. But there have been times when Mason must have felt invisible, as injuries and ill-conceived loan spells delayed his breakthrough. He came close to turning his back on the club he loves, but then Pochettino arrived and, after 16 years at Spurs, he is finally an overnight sensation.

Tottenham (2008 - ): 17 games, 1 goal

Yeovil (loan, 2009-10): 29 games, 6 goals

Doncaster (loan, 2010-11): 20 games, 1 goal

Millwall (loan, 2011-12): 6 games, 0 goals

Lorient (loan, 2013): 0 games

Swindon (loan, 2013-14): 22 games, 5 goals

Total: 91 games, 13 goals 

‘It’s something I’ve been waiting for,’ said Mason. ‘If this manager had been in charge two or three years ago, I would probably have 50 or 60 Premier League games under my belt by now. I’m in the team now and I can’t complain. It’s a great feeling. I’ve always believed I could play for this club.’

There were times when he had to fight the urge to leave. It was tempting when Eddie Howe wanted him at Burnley and Sean O’Driscoll tried to lure him to Doncaster, but he believed in his own ability.

‘It’s difficult to take when you don’t get the chance,’ said Mason. He speaks quietly but clearly and his words have meaning. He is not afraid of expressing his opinion.

‘There were times when I just wanted to leave and have a fresh start. I wasn’t getting the opportunities I thought I deserved.

‘I thought maybe going to a new club would change all that and that if I moved permanently instead of going on loan, I’d get treated differently. There were a few clubs in the Championship and I spoke to some managers, but I wanted to play for Tottenham. There was always that doubt that if I left I’d end up regretting it, and I would have definitely regretted it.’ 

During a frustrating spell at Spurs, Mason was tempted to take up an offer from Eddie Howe at Burnley

His story is a triumph for patience and faith, which are the attributes prompting some to tip him as a future Spurs captain.

‘He’s shown character and resilience,’ said Hazard. ‘There are not many opportunities in modern football — not like in my day — but I’m surprised he’s taken so long and it’s not easy to be patient. He clearly had the ability. From the age of six or seven, he stood out. He always knew what to do and where to do it. He had a natural understanding, and football intelligence separates the good from the great.

‘If you have a good football brain you can reach the very highest level, because the brain tells the feet what to do. He has good feet, good skill, he’s a good passer. You can still see he rarely gets caught.’

Mason had just turned seven when he attended one of Hazard’s soccer schools in Hertfordshire and, before he knew it, he was training at Tottenham, pocketing free tickets and marvelling at Teddy Sheringham from the stands.

He was a No 10 like Sheringham until he went on loan to Yeovil where manager Terry Skiverton moved him deeper into the role he now plays. ‘I was a luxury player,’ said Mason. ‘Having been pampered at Tottenham for so long, I went into League One and had to graft and learn the ugly side of the game. I grew as a player.’

He was just 17 when Harry Redknapp gave him his Tottenham debut as a late substitute in a UEFA Cup tie, at the start of a season when he would score 58 goals for the youth team. But it was nearly six years before Mason started his first Premier League game, a north London derby at Arsenal.

Between the dates there were loans at Yeovil, Millwall, Doncaster and Swindon and a disastrous five months at French club Lorient. He did not make a single appearance.

‘That was a bad experience,’ says Mason. ‘I was pretty close to the Tottenham first team and I’d been on the bench quite a bit, made my first start in the League Cup and then got a knee injury.

‘It was nothing major but I was out for a couple weeks and I fell down the pecking order. It probably wasn’t a good idea to pick Lorient but I thought playing in the top league in France would be better than playing in the Championship again. It just didn’t work out. I couldn’t wait to get home. I was there on my own from January until the end of the season.

‘I picked up a bit of French — that was the best part about it. I spent that season hardly kicking a ball.’ Others might have stormed home, but Mason was determined to see it out. A loan to Swindon eased the pain, but niggling injuries went on and his efforts to beef up didn’t help.

‘Between 18 and 21, a lot of people said I needed to put on weight,’ he said. ‘In England there’s a philosophy that it’s better to be bigger and stronger. I was in the gym doing bench-presses which had no relevance and it wasn’t helping me on the pitch. It was extra weight I didn’t need and I couldn’t carry. A lot of injuries came through that. Now I’m in a better place. I’m just under 6ft, I’m wiry and probably the lightest I’ve been, but the strongest.’

Pochettino’s arrival last summer from Southampton changed everything. Mason, now a box-to-box midfielder, has started the past 11 league games, keeping out expensive signings such as Paulinho and Mousa Dembele.

It has been a spluttering Spurs season but there are signs of progress, climbing the Premier League and in a Capital One Cup quarter-final against Newcastle for which Pochettino, mindful of the heavy holiday fixture list ahead, may well shuffle his pack

Mason said: ‘This club needs to win trophies. It’s important to aim for the Champions League as well. Though we’ve had a pretty poor start we’re close to fourth and if we can get consistency it can happen.’

Mature and confident, he has embraced responsibilities on and off the pitch. Last week, he joined team-mates to deliver Christmas gifts to children in Harlow’s Princess Alexandra Hospital.

‘Two or three weeks into pre- season, I realised it might be different,’ said Mason. ‘Maybe it came down to a bit of trust. The gaffer recognised I had a good pre-season and was training well. He said I’d play for him in the Premier League this season. To hear that was great.

‘He’s a strong believer in giving 100 per cent in training. If you’re training well, you’ll play and I was one of the better players in training. 

'He’s showed a lot of faith in me. I’m 23 and I feel like I deserve to be playing. It’s not like I’m a kid being thrown in. At the same time, not many managers would put an inexperienced player into the Premier League.

‘It’s such a big league, not many young, English, homegrown players get a fair crack of the whip, but this gaffer brought young players through at Southampton. Hopefully I can continue to pay him back. I don’t want to be one of these players who have a good little spell.’
