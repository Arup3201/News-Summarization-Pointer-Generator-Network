Julie Davies has been paid around £22,950 in salary since being suspended by Haringey Council, in North London, on July 17 last year over concerns from headteachers and over alleged tweets

A teaching union rep who hasn't taught a lesson for 14 years remains on full pay six months after being suspended - costing the taxpayer £46,000 a year.  

Julie Davies has been paid around £22,950 in salary since being suspended by Haringey Council, in North London, on July 17 last year over concerns from headteachers and over alleged tweets.

The £45,900-a-year English teacher who now works as a National Union of Teachers (NUT) rep has not actually held a lesson for 14 years and has earned around £500,000 since 2000.

Disciplinary proceedings against the teacher are still to be resolved but the local authority has refused to say whether an end is in sight, and has confirmed she remains on full pay.  

Mrs Davies was suspended in July over the concerns expressed by heads as well as other allegations, including that she sent a tweet spreading news about a Haringey mayor 'abusing' her position and also that she fired off a rude email to a councillor after food waste was not collected in her street. 

Headteachers has accused Mrs Davies of encouraging a 'climate of mistrust' and she has also angered parents by leading strikes at two North London schools over her own suspension. 

A website set up in support of Mrs Davies has claimed she has 'filed a legal claim for victimisation'. 

A spokesman for the Labour-run local Haringey council said this week that the 'matter was ongoing'.

They added: 'We cannot comment on an individual case, but it is council policy, and well-established in employment law, that when an employee is suspended, they continue to receive full pay.'

Mrs Davies wrote on Twitter this week: 'I have been suspended for 6 months. Could the #haringeycouncil officer who reads my tweets for a living get back to me? #stillhere'.

The JulieDavies.org.uk website claims the rep is facing dismissal, with a decision on whether charges against her should proceed to a disciplinary hearing still to be taken.

They relate to Mrs Davies allegedly tweeting about the borough mayor, a settlement agreement she was offered and bin collections in her street.

It adds that further charges are still being investigated while others, relating to complaints about the rep by headteachers, have been dropped.

A statement on the website reads: 'We think the council is moving out of the realms of victimising its rep and could now be accused of political persecution'. 

The NUT bankrolled the strikes, which disrupted the education of around 3,000 children at two state schools and took place despite only 50 to 60 per cent of teachers voting for them.

Mrs Davies had previously lost a legal claim that Haringey did not have the power to suspend her or take any other disciplinary action against her.
