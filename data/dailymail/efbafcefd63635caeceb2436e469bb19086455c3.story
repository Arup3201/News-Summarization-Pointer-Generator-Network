Celtic are monitoring Tranmere Rovers midfielder Max Power.

The Glasgow club posted scouts at Tranmere's home game with Northampton Town last Saturday.

Power is out of contract in the summer and so Celtic may be able to secure his signature for a knockdown price.

The 21-year-old graduated from Tranmere's academy and made his debut in 2011.

He has played 101 times for Rovers, netting on 15 occasions.

In fact, Power is so highly regarded at the club that he was made vice-captain at the beginning of the season and has skippered the side on numerous occasions.
