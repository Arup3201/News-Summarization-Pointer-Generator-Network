An Austrian man who was punched in the eye has developed a cataract shaped like a star.

The unnamed 55-year-old went to his doctor after the vision in that eye began to deteriorate over the next six months, according to a report in the New England Journal of Medicine.Â 

The patient said he'd been punched nine months earlier, the doctors from the Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, wrote in their report.

'Nature has made a beautiful cataract': Doctors in Austria reported the case of a 55-year-old man who'd been punched in the eye nine months earlier

Cataracts are where the lenses in the eye become clouded, causing blurred 
vision.

It's most common for them to form with old age - an estimated one in three people over 65 have them - but they can also be caused by injury to the eye.

Cataracts are where the lenses in the eye become clouded, causing blurred

It's most common for them to form with old age - an estimated 
one in three people over 65 have them - but they can also be caused by 
injury to the eye.

Symptoms include problems seeing in dim light, while bright lights may appear more
 glaring.

Colours may appear different and there may be a yellow tinge 
to vision.

In fact, it's very common for cataracts to form 
if the eye is hit, Dr Mark Fromer, an ophthalmologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, told LiveScience.

In this case, 'nature has made a beautiful cataract,' he said. 'Most aren't so pretty.'

After being punched, balls used in sport are the most common cause - but injuries from airbags and steering wheels have also caused cataracts, he added.

He said if the eyeball receives trauma, such as a punch, the energy 
of the blow sends shock waves through the eye. This can damage the eye's lens, triggering the formation of a cataract.

Cataracts typically make the eye look cloudy and are white or yellow in appearance.

The man is reported to have had the cataract broken up by a procedure called 'phacoemulsification' - where sound waves break up the opaque part of the lens and it is removed with a vacuum.
