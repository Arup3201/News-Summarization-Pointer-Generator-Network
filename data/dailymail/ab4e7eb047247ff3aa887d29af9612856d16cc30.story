John Bellamy, 72, indecently assaulted five boys aged 11 to 14 over a five-year period in the 1970s

A choirmaster who forced boys to strip before spanking them during private singing lessons at his home has been jailed for two years.

John Bellamy, 72, indecently assaulted five boys aged 11 to 14 over a five-year period in the 1970s.

The offences happened while he was choirmaster at St James the Greater Church in Leicester. 

Bellamy, from Knighton, Leicester, assaulted the boys after inviting them to his home to help them with breathing exercises to improve their singing.

Earlier in the trial one of his victims told how he was abused by Bellamy when he was aged 13.

He told the jury: 'I was taken into a backroom where Bellamy told me to take my trousers and pants off. He said I needed to be punished.

'He spanked me about six to ten times. Then he started stroking me on the backside.

'He said he was sorry that he was having to do this again and he hoped he would not have to do this again.

'I remember at the time I was being spanked I thought this was punishment. When he started to stroke me and the tone of his voice change I thought 'this is not right"'.  

At Worcester Crown Court, a jury convicted him of six charges of indecent assault and two of gross indecency.

Judge Michael Cullum told Bellamy: 'You are a man who has given a lot to the community, been an organist for many years, a choirmaster running camps for the children and also teaching for over 40 years.

Judge Michael Cullum told Bellamy: 'Seeing men reduced to tears by the memories of your hands on them would be difficult to forget.'You gravely affected many lives'

'However it was clear you had a fondness for these boys that was inappropriate and that developed into the sexual.

'You hurt the children everyone thought you were looking after and teaching.

'What was remarkable in this case was how much it hurt those individuals.

'Seeing men reduced to tears by the memories of your hands on them would be difficult to forget.

'You gravely affected many lives.'
