Brandi Glanville burst into tears on the Bravo chat show Watch What Happens Live on Tuesday after throwing wine at fellow  guest Jeff Lewis.

The chat show hosted by Andy Cohen aired following the latest episode of The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills in which Brandi also tossed wine on new housewife Eileen Davidson. 

Jeff, 44, who stars in Bravo's Flipping Out home renovation series, made a joke about getting a sexually transmitted disease from Brandi, 42, touching his hair and it struck a raw nerve.

Moment of impact: The Flipping Out star was left covered in alcohol 

Gobsmacked: Jeff was genuinely taken back by the move 

As the show returned from commercial break Brandi tossed a glass of wine at Jeff and then turned away from the camera as she burst into tears.

'I'm taking five,' Brandi said clearly overcome with emotion. 

Brandi in her 2014 book Drinking And Dating: P.S. Social Media Is Ruining Romance claimed that she caught a sexually transmitted disease - human papillomavirus - from her ex-husband Eddie Cibrian.

Jeff tried to reach over and apologise but was initially rebuffed by Brandi as she tried to gather herself.

'I'm not going to touch her, I'm just saying sorry,' Jeff said.

Andy tried to salvage the show, but it was clearly awkward for everyone.

Tossing wine appeared to be one of Brandi's favourite sports as she flung a full glass of wine in Eileen's face for no reason at all in the latest episode of Real Housewives.

Brandi had already taken a girls' night out into an unexpectedly awkward direction when she confronted Eileen about how she and her husband, Vincent Van Patten, were married to other people when they met.

But she then made it even worse when she drunkenly started insisting Eileen act like her character on the TV soap opera Days Of Our Lives, even giving her $40 to do it and leaving Eileen clearly annoyed as she asked: 'What am I, a circus seal?'

Then out of nowhere Brandi flung her wine in Eileen's face - leaving the actress in tears and the other housewives stunned.

Admitting she was 'confused and angry and humiliated', Eileen said: 'It's just shocking and bizarre.'

And fellow dinner guest Lisa Rinna insisted she would 'probably be in a cop car' if Brandi had done the same to her, calling it 'absolutely inappropriate - and f***ing weird'.

The next day, telling husband Vince that she hadn't slept all night because of it, Eileen admitted she was concerned at how much of a 'creepy fan' Brandi appears to be of her TV show.

'I'm going to be very cautious around Brandi,' Eileen admitted. 'I think she's capable of almost anything.'

Not nice: Eileen was soaked by wine tossed onto her by Brandi

The wild wine attack was the talk of a dinner thrown the next evening by Yolanda Foster, even after Brandi instantly apologized to Eileen, blaming drink and wanting 'a soap opera moment'.

But the other housewives may be less forgiving.

'I want to take care of her - but I also want to f***ing spank her at the same time,' said Lisa Rinna who insisting Brandi was 'a wounded little girl' who needs attention.

And Lisa Vanderpump - who Brand had only just started to make peace with after their earlier falling out - was also clearly outraged.

'This is a beautiful elegant woman - Eileen, not Brandi - and to throw a glass of wine in her face? I've heard and seen some things from Brandi but this is a whole new low,' Lisa insisted.

While Eileen insisted she accepted Brandi's apology, she admitted later: 'Still don't trust her.'

Brandi then sparked further offense at Yolanda's party, telling singer Babyface that his wife's rings 'could be bigger' - and then telling Yolanda's husband David Foster that he looked like he was 'finger banging' as he excitedly gesticulated with Babyface as they tried to write an impromptu song.

'If that's not some white trash I don't know what is,' Lisa Rinna said of Brandi's behavior.

Her latest acting out came just hours after she appeared to be getting somewhere with Lisa Vanderpump, taking her to lunch for a heart-to-heart after weeks of trying to patch-up their friendship.

But while they made some progress, Lisa made it evident things will never be as they were before, warning Brandi: 'I can't be the friend that you want.'

And when Brandi later told friends that they were 'moving forward but just taking it slow', Lisa stressed: 'Really slow. I'm serious.'
