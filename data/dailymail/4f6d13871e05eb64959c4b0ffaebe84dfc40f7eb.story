A father accused of torturing and killing his two young children, and burying their bodies in Alabama and Mississippi, has been found guilty of capital murder.

John DeBlase was convicted Wednesday after a 10-day trial. DeBlase and his common-law wife, Heather Keaton, have each blamed each other for the killings of DeBlase's 4-year-old daughter Natalie and his 3-year-old son Chase, who were poisoned with antifreeze and strangled to death four years ago. 

Miss Keaton will be tried separately for the killings in March.

Guilty: John DeBlase (pictured in court on October 22) has been convicted of capital murder for killing his two children in 2010  

Tragic: Natalie (left) and Chase (right) were killed in Mobile County in 2010. Chase's remains were discovered in a wooden area in Vancleave, Mississippi in December 2010. His sister's were found just days later

John DeBlase's attorneys argued that Keaton's harsh discipline tactics lead to the children's deaths, but prosecutors said DeBlase likely killed the children to end their suffering.

'I don't think there's any doubt that the person who had the motive and hatred was Heather Keaton,' defense attorney Glenn Davidson said during his closing arguments Tuesday. 

'She had no regard for the children and evidence showed she had no concern for their safety or their well-being. She was consumed with jealousy of Natalie's relationship with her father. When she couldn't control the children, she killed them.'

Local media outlets reported that 31-year-old DeBlase showed little emotion other than shake his bowed head as the jury's unanimous verdict was read aloud in court.

The father faces either life in prison or the death penalty, and is likely to be sentenced Thursday or Friday after testimony from character witnesses. 

DeBlase's parents, Richard and Ann DeBlase, were in the courtroom when the verdict was announced.

Mrs DeBlase told Fox 10 TV she is confused and feels like she lost her best friend. Wearing a pink dress with an angel brooch pinned to the front in honor of her slain grandchildren, she revealed that she was hoping for a 'not guilty' verdict.

The biological mother of the victims wept in court last week as she told of how she had trusted her ex-husband to care for them.

Wiping away tears, Corrine DeBlase said she had given up custody of her daughter Natalie, four, and three-year-old son Chase to John DeBlase in 2008 because she thought he was a 'good father'.

'He was their father, he was supposed to protect them. That's what a father is supposed to do,' she told the jury.

She added: 'Nobody can blame me more than I can blame myself. I know there are things I could have done then. I was their mother I should have done something.'Scroll down for video

Natalie and Chase were killed in Mobile County, Alabama, in 2010. Chase's remains were found in a wooden area in Vancleave, Mississippi, in December 2010, six months after he was killed.

His sister's remains were discovered in Cintronelle days later. DeBlase, then 27, and his common-law wife, Heather Keaton, then 22, have been charged with murder. They have blamed each other.

Taking to the witness stand today, Mrs DeBlase said she had been forced to give up custody of her 'well-mannered' children after she lost her job and home, and her marriage collapsed.

She said that her ex-husband mainly treated Natalie like 'his little princess', but had once 'popped her in her mouth' when she was suffering from a night terror, according to AL.com.

Both accused: Yesterday, Brandon Newburn a former cellmate of DeBlase (left), claimed the suspect wrote a series of letters saying he choked the youngsters to 'end their suffering' at the hands of Keaton (right)

She said the last time she had seen her children was November 17, 2009. A year later, she was told the youngsters were missing, Fox 10 reported.

'They were my heart. It may not seem the way they make it look but I loved them so much. I loved them so much and I can’t have no more (kids),' Mrs DeBlase told the court.

Yesterday, Brandon Newburn a former cellmate of DeBlase, claimed  the suspect wrote a series of letters saying he choked the youngsters to 'end their suffering' at the hands of Keaton.

In the 10 letters, DeBlase reportedly said Keaton rained 'tortures and abuse' on his children at their home in Mobile County, Alabama, before finally giving him an ultimatum that it was 'her or the kids'.  

Innocent: Today, Mrs DeBlase said that her ex-husband mainly treated Natalie (pictured at a younger age) like 'his little princess', but had once 'popped her in her mouth' when she was suffering from a night terror

Siblings: Natalie (right) was reportedly killed on March 4, 2010. Her brother (left) died on June 20, 2010

The father also allegedly revealed that Keaton was spiking his children's sippy cups with antifreeze because she wanted to 'break their spirits so they would be more obedient to her will'.

In the hours before their deaths, the stepmother duct-taped and gagged the helpless youngsters, according to the letters, the TV station reported. 

DeBlase then allegedly wrote he 'picked them up in the air and choked them to death... where their bodies hung lifeless,' adding: 'I know what I did was wrong, but she left me no choice.'

Welling up: The grieving mother (pictured speaking to reporters outside the courtroom) said the last time she had seen her children was November 17, 2009. A year later, she was told the youngsters were missing

Lost without her children: 'They were my heart. It may not seem the way they make it look but I loved them so much. I loved them so much and I can’t have no more (kids),' Mrs DeBlase (pictured) told the court

The defense contends Newburn coerced DeBlase and cannot be trusted.

Natalie was reportedly killed at her father's Peach Place apartment on March 4, 2010. Her brother died on June 20, 2010, according to police.
