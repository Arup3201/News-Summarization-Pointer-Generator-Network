A Colorado man could be facing animal cruelty charges after he was photographed abandoning his dog at Denver Animal Control last Monday.

Officials say the dog’s owner, Daniel Sohn, tossed his German Shepherd, named Bronson, into the lobby of their office and quickly fled.

However Bronson managed to escape and ran after his owner.

A Colorado man is facing animal cruelty charges after he abandoned his dog at Denver Animal Control last Monday

Daniel Sohn admitted to a local TV station on Tuesday that the car and dog were his and explained that the dog had followed him 'because we have a bit of a bond'

Eyewitnesses say the man got in his vehicle, reversed his car and almost hit Bronson before the dog jumped into his owner’s vehicle.

Later the same day, the dog owner returned and did the same thing, Lieutenant Aaron McSpadden of Denver Animal Control told 9NEWS.

Sohn was tracked down on Tuesday by TheDenverChannel. He confirmed that the car and dog were his and explained that the dog had followed him ‘because we have a bit of a bond.’

He denies that he hit Bronson. 'He jumped in front of my car but I felt he was triggered to do so as if like he was a mechanism of the surrounding people,' said Sohn.

Sohn also attempted to deny that he had even tried to ditch his pet, who is male and is black and brown.

‘Well I didn't ditch him. I actually dropped my dog off at the shelter where I did pick him up at,' he said.

'I actually gave my dog a choice if he wanted to be with me or possibly find an owner he might feel better with.'

Sohn said that after the two attempts to leave Bronson at the Denver Animal Shelter he drove with the dog to Los Angeles where he claims the dog jumped out of his car.

'Is he still alive? I’m sure he is,' Sohn told The DenverChannel.

According to McSpadden, an investigation has been launched to establish why Sohn tried to dump Bronson without properly surrendering him.
