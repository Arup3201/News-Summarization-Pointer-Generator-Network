Self-taught photographer Sarolta Bán is best known for her dream-like landscape images which have been displayed in galleries across Europe.

But she has now decided to turn her talents of transforming everyday scenes into magical pictures using digital photo manipulation to help re-home abandoned animals.

Bán, from Hungary, asked people to submit images of rescue animals needing a home on her Facebook page so she could create stunning portraits of them.

So far she has received dozens of photos of rescue animals from around the world - including Spain, Argentina, India, France, Hungary, and the United States - who are in desperate need of a permanent home.

Waiting game: Bán hopes her magical images will help highlight the plight of homeless animals and encourage potential new owners to adopt them

Campaign: Bán asked people to submit images of homeless pets on her Facebook page and then used the photos to create this collection of surreal images

She has managed to transform several of the pictures into unusual dream-like sequences by repeatedly layering the image but keeping the homeless animal as the focus point.

Bán hopes people may be inspired to adopt the animals after seeing the montages.

Writing on her Facebook project page, she said: 'Abandoned dogs sadly have really few chances to appear on a photo that will help them get out of the shelter. A photo that stands out from the crowd, and "speaks" to a person.

Creative: Bán layers several images over each other to create her unique photos

Adrift: Anyone who adopts one of the animals featured in the pictures will get a free print

Bán focused mainly on dogs but also produced images of cats looking for a new home

'I would really like to help sheltered animals and for sure a good picture can be worth a thousand words.'

She added that she hopes the images will help give shelter animals 'extra visibility' and help to a 'give bigger impact'.

Bán will also give future owners who adopt through the project a free print of the picture of their new pet.

The project ends in mid-April and Bán hopes to complete as many images as possible before then.
