A 40 per cent stake in Eurostar has been put up for grabs by the Government as part of plans to privatise £20 billion of financial and corporate assets by 2020.

Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander is expected to announce the plans for the cross channel rail operator today, as part of the new national infrastructure plan (NIP).

The plans will outline more than £375 billion of planned public and private investments to 2030 and beyond.

Ministers have also been given a boost by major players from the insurance industry, who have also announced plans to invest £25 billion in UK infrastructure projects over the next five years.

The plans set out today include a new target for selling off financial assets, doubling the amount from £10 billion to £20 billion including the shareholding in the cross-channel train operator.

It comes weeks after the Government faced heavy criticism for undervaluing Royal Mail during its flotation.

Last month Eurostar revealed it had seen an increase passenger numbers and revenue compared with last summer.

Sales revenue for the period July-September 2013 reached £207 million - a 10 per cent increase on the same period last year - and passenger numbers in summer 2013 rose 5 per cent to 2.7 million.

The planned infrastructure investment has increased from £309 billion last year to more than £375 billion, with 291 of the 646 projects and programmes already under construction.

Insurers Legal and General, Prudential, Aviva, Standard Life, Friends Life and Scottish Widows have announced plans to invest in infrastructure.

This follows changes in European rules pushed for by the UK which incentivise investment in a wider range of assets.

Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander will unveil the NIP today, alongside Commercial Secretary and former London Olympics chief Lord Deighton.

Mr Alexander will say: 'The announcement today that six major insurers will invest £25 billion over the next five years is a massive vote of confidence in the UK economy.

'It supports the wider £100 billion public investment to rebuild Britain over the next seven years that I announced at the Spending Round 2013. Underground, overground, onshore, offshore, wired or wireless, tarmac or train track. You name it, we're building it right now.

'This is great news for the people of the UK because after years of neglect, the UK's energy, road, rail, flood defence, communications and water infrastructure needs renewal.

'It will boost the UK economy creating jobs and making it easier to do business. It will also make the UK a better place to live for everyone who calls it their home.'

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today 
programme this morning, Mr Alexander declined to comment on other 
potential sell-offs suggested to him – including the Royal Mint and the 
Met Office - in addition to the Eurostar.

He said: ‘What I’m setting out today is an ambition with some examples of things that we could sell.’

Asked
about plans to cut funding for renewable energy sources, including 
on-shire wind farms, which he said 'are a very important part of meeting
our energy needs', and solar power, he said: 'I believe passionately in
meeting this country’s obligations to tackle climate change.'

But Mr Alexander added that he wants Britain to meet its climate targets 'in the most cost effective way we can'.

Association of British Insurers director general Otto Thoresen said: 'Insurers have a key role to play in contributing to the UK's economic growth, as providers of long-term capital investment. Providing capital for infrastructure projects will help drive a competitive, healthy and resilient UK economy.'

The decision to drop plans to toll the upgraded A14 has been welcomed by campaigners and follows David Cameron's acknowledgement of the 'strong feelings' about the proposal in East Anglia.

RAC Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: 'Piecemeal tolling that would raise little money but create a lot of aggravation and delay was always going to be a hard sell and not the best advert for pay-as-you-go driving.'

At Prime Minister's Questions last week, Mr Cameron said: 'I am well aware of the strong feelings in Suffolk about this issue and I have been approached about it by many Members of Parliament.

'I believe that road tolls can play an important part in providing new road capacity and it is important that we find ways to pay for road capacity, but I also understand the concerns about this individual case.'

Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie said: 'With the country facing a cost-of-living crisis we need to invest in infrastructure to create jobs, boost living standards and strengthen our economy for the long term.

'But for the last three-and-a-half years the Government's record on infrastructure has been one of complete failure. The ONS says that infrastructure work is down 3.7 per cent in the last year and fell by 10 per centin 2012. And in the spending review the Government set out plans to cut capital investment even further in real terms in 2015/16.

'Scheme after scheme has been announced to great fanfare but then little actually delivered. Yet another announcement from ministers about possible future investment will do little to reassure business that warm words will finally translate into diggers in the ground.'

Prudential's group chief executive Tidjane Thiam said: 'As a major long-term investor in the UK, Prudential is pleased to commit to harness our financial strength for the benefit of the UK economy.

'This initiative will help achieve sustainable economic growth. We are already a significant player in infrastructure investment in the UK with more than £40 billion invested across sectors, including property.

'Creating the conditions for increased investment in infrastructure from Prudential and the insurance industry has been a key concern of mine as chairman of the ABI (Association of British Insurers).

'We as an industry worked very hard to ensure a good outcome to Solvency II and we recently welcomed the conclusion of the negotiations in Brussels last month, which among other improvements, has made it more likely that insurers can continue to invest in infrastructure.

'It will be important to ensure that this progress is not jeopardised as Solvency II moves to the implementation stage.'
