Kate Moss has graced the cover of Vogue 33 times but now she's gone behind the scenes by becoming a contributing fashion editor for the magazine.

British Vogue today unveiled the 40-year-old model's first shoot for the fashion bible in all its glossy glory.

The shoot, which features in the March issue, is called Cause 
Célèbre and is inspired by the devil-may-care glamour of cult seventies 
band Destroy All Monsters.

It's here! The Vogue March issue, which Kate Moss styled a shoot for, has landed in all its glossy glory

Bringing four fashion legends together, the shoot features model Daria Werbowy, is styled by 
Kate and is photographed by duo Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott.

Speaking about the shoot, Ella Alexander of Vogue.co.uk, writes: 'Working with cover girl Werbowy and long-time friends and collaborators Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, Moss creates a hazily beautiful world - with a healthy splash of the rock'n'roll cool that you would expect from the world's most photographed supermodel.'

In her Editor's letter, Alexandra Shulman writes: 'Kate Moss, surely one of the most famous free spirits of our age, has styled her first fashion shoot for us. 

'Case Célèbre is - possibly unsurprisingly - a homage to renegade rock style.

'From gathering the initial moodboard to talking me through the rail of clothes in the Vogue fashion room and adjusting the accessories on Daria Werbowy, Kate took on the complete role of fashion editor - although perhaps not every editor takes her model out partying on the first night of the shoot!'.

When Vogue announced the new role last October they promised Moss would bring her decades of experience in the industry to fashion shoots and 'work with her choice of photographers and models'.

At the time, Alexandra Shulman, said: 'I am absolutely delighted that Kate 
is going to work with us in this new role.

'Her 
undoubtedly brilliant sense of style, depth of fashion knowledge and 
understanding of what makes a wonderful image will be exciting to see on
the pages of British Vogue. I am really looking forward to working with
her on ideas.'

Natural career development: The model will bring her years of experience on fashion shoots to her role

Sarah Doukas, founder of Storm Models who represent Moss, added: 'We are absolutely thrilled at Kate's appointment.

'This
 is a natural development in her remarkable career. Bringing her unique 
sense of style and  creative sensibility to Vogue is the perfect fit. 
She is the definitive Vogue cover girl.'

She may have just hit the big 4-0 but Kate Moss clearly isn't letting her age get in the way of her career if her recent projects are anything to go by.

The
 editorial role adds another string to Moss's bow after it was also 
announced that she will once again collaborate with Topshop.

The
 Croydon-born model last worked with the High Street brand between 
2007-2010 and will now design a new collection to be sold in 40 
countries in 2014.

The
 blonde - who last month celebrated her milestone birthday with an 
epic week-long celebration - was also unveiled as the face of Alexander 
McQueen's SS14 campaign, Rimmel's SS14 campaign, as well as the pre-SS14campaign for Liu J.
