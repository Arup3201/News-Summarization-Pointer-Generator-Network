They are hound dogs who love the thrill of the chase.

But while Beagles usually track rabbits and deer, in Australia a pack of the dogs are having more fun pursuing a remote control car.

Brisbane man Andrew Ison captured his Beagles chasing the toy around a park during one of his regular meet-ups with the unofficial Beagle Club of Queensland.

Mr Ison posted the video, which has now been watched over 200,000 times, on YouTube and one commenter exclaimed: 'I could watch this all day.'

Beagle derby! The hounds chased the blue and red remote control car in a Queensland park  

The man, who goes by the name of RedKrawler online, has six Beagles - Sally, Leia, Abby, Keeper, Bolty and Flo - and keeps his online followers up to date with his pets' antics.

The 'Beagle derby', as he called it, took place Alexander Clark Park in Loganholme, Queensland.

The Beagles are heard barking frantically as they run and chase a blue and red remote control car around an obstacle course and through a tunnel in the video.

A man in blue shorts and a cap stands in the middle of the track with the controls, as others watch the dogs from the sidelines of the pen.

But the video ends before the dogs actually catch the car.

'We met up with some fellow Beagle owners and took some photos of our pack chasing a radio control car around. They enjoyed it - a lot,' Mr Ison wrote on Reddit.

He also posted photos on image sharing website Imgur, explaining: 'I think the photos better highlight the majesty of the ears and jowls flying everywhere.'

One YouTube user called Melinda Kirby commented on the video: 'I have 5 beagles and I found this hilarious!

'These beagles are having fun and doing what comes naturally: chasing something. Beagles were originally bred to hunt rabbits, and they are wonderful at it.'

Rebecca Ritchie added: 'This is awesome... I need to get one for my Beagle to chase lol. Or find a doggy park full of beagles! ﻿'

However, another YouTube user, Mr Johnson, said the video was cruel: 'Those dogs have no idea what that car is and you can tell by the noises they're making that they are really scared.'

While Please Ban Me blasted the video as: 'Animal cruelty. This will severely psychologically damage a dog as they are chasing for an object they can never catch. This leads to depression and weight gain. Reported.﻿'

A spokesperson for the RSPCA in Queensland told Daily Mail Australia: 'We Wouldn't be investigating something like this as animal cruelty.'
