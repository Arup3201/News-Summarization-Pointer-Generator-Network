Frenzied festive shopping reaches fever pitch two weekends before Christmas, according to new research.

The study revealed that the so-called Shoppergeddon phenomenon will fall this Saturday 14 December at exactly 1.55pm.

The moment is set to be the busiest and most stressful time on British high streets as people rush to get their Christmas shopping done.

The survey also revealed that nearly a third of us will experience anger while shopping tomorrow due to overcrowding on our streets, while more than a quarter confess they get 'pavement rage' due to the overwhelming flow of people traffic.

Almost half (46 per cent) of people feel most stressed about the amount of time it takes to get from one shop to another, while more than a third (37 per cent) admit that busy crowds are their biggest source of stress while Christmas shopping.

It's female
 shoppers who seem to be bearing the brunt of the pavement rage epidemic.

Half admit to feeling frustrated about the amount of time it 
takes to get from A to B on congested pavements, compared to just 40 per
 cent of men.

When it comes to dealing with their rage, women are the more passive aggressive than men.

One in five 
(22 per cent) will 'huff and puff' at other pedestrians under their 
breath, whereas 7 per cent of men will abandon Christmas shopping 
altogether and head to the nearest pub when stressed.

Despite all the stress, women
 are more likely to get into the festive spirit, with nearly two fifths 
(39 per cent) experiencing happiness about buying gifts for themselves, 
friends and family - compared to just over one fifth (22 per cent) of 
men.

One in five (20 per cent) 
feel 'happy' when buying gifts for their loved ones on the High Street, 
and 11 per cent feel 'excited'.

Furthermore, the majority of the 2,000 respondent said they still prefer to shop on the High Street than online.

The research was commissioned by local 
product finder app Udozi to mark the launch of its 'Pavement Code' 
video, spoofing the popular 1970s Green Cross Code adverts.

A spokesperson said: 'As we get closer to Christmas, it's no surprise that high streets are going to be busier than ever at weekends.

'But as the shops get increasingly more crowded, it can be difficult to find what you want - and busy pavements can make things even more stressful. So remember to plan your route before you go out and use services that let you reserve items, so you won't be disappointed if what you need isn't in stock.'

A new study reveals that Britain will 
collectively spend 150 million hours (equivalent to 6.2 million days or 
17,170 years) in total doing their festive shopping.

On average, shoppers
 will spend 3 hours and 21 minutes each hitting the stores
 to snap up the perfect gifts this Christmas.

Those in 
Leicester will spend the most time at the shops, 
with visitors to the East Midlands city spending on average 5 hours and 
31 minutes in the shops on a hunt for presents.

That's more than twice the time those from Portsmouth will spend Shopping. As the speediest shoppers in the UK, they'll whizz round in just 2 hours and 
10 minutes.

Those in 
London will spend 4 hours and 35 minutes, the study by car park experts, NCP found.
