A Michigan mom who complained about a transgender woman using the female locker room at her gym had her membership instantly revoked after making the complaint.

Yvette Cormier says she was undressing at the Planet Fitness in Midland when she realized 'there was a man' in the change room.

The 48-year-old went to the front desk to alert them, however staff informed her the person was transsexual and was allowed to be in the locker room.

When Cormier pressed ahead with her complaint, the gym said she had violated their much-touted 'no judgement zone' policy and canceled her membership.

'I was stunned and shocked,' Cormier told WNEM. 

'He looked like a man.

'He did not look like a woman.'

Cormier maintains she wasn't complaining because the person was transsexual, but because she thought there was a man in the women's room. 

'This is very unprofessional,' she added.

'This is very scary.'

However, despite her explanation and the media attention that has surrounded it, Planet Fitness have not budged on the stance they took with Cormier.

The gym says that Cormier has been talking about the incident with other people at the gym and she has been inappropriate.

'Planet Fitness is committed to creating a non-intimidating, welcoming environment for our members,' the gym said in a statement.

'Our gender identity non-discrimination policy states that members and guests may use all gym facilities based on their sincere self-reported gender identity.

'In expressing her concerns about the policy, the member in question exhibited behavior that club management deemed inappropriate and disruptive to other members, which is a violation of the membership agreement and as a result her membership was canceled.'

Yvette Cormier, 48, said she was walking into the Midland Planet Fitness locker room last Saturday when she saw someone 'dressed like a man'

Planet Fitness Director of Public Relations McCall Gosselin told ABC News that Cormier handled the situation poorly.

'As our statement outlines, her membership was not cancelled as a result of complaints about our policy, as we welcome all feedback from our members,' Gosselin told ABC.

'Rather, it was the manner in which her concerns were expressed that club management felt was inappropriate, which resulted in the cancellation.'
