One little girl stole the Duchess of Cambridge's heart today as she greeted the princess in Dunedin, New Zealand, with a traditional Maori hello - and then politely asked for a hug.

Five-year-old Mataawhio Matahaere-vieint welcomed Kate, 32, with a curtsey and a hongi - a greeting, which involves touching noses - before the little girl gave the Duchess of Cambridge a cuddle.

Afterwards the little girl said: 'I asked if I could hug her and she said yes, she was beautiful.'

Kate seemed more than happy to give Mataawhio the hug she requested after they held hands 

After greeting Kate with a hug, Mataawhio gave her books for Prince George.

Meanwhile, another local Ripeka Potiki, seven, gave the royal couple a gift of albatross feathers from the royal albatross who have their only mainland breeding colony in Dunedin.

And William spoke to tribal elder Edward Ellison, 63.

He said: 'William said thank you very much for the welcome.

'He said that it was a bit like being in Edinburgh with the conditions, the weather and the bagpipes.

'We are very excited they're here.

'They are an inspirational couple and we hear a lot about them.'

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrived in Dunedin this morning to grey skies. The couple disembarked their RNZAF jet - on which they were joined by the entire British media - to a traditional Maori welcome from the Ngai Tahu tribe, the main tribe on the South Island.

Elders from the tribe conducted a welcome - or Powhiri - which involved chanting at the couple from some distance before inviting them forward.

Although their voices could barely be heard over the roars of nearby planes, the welcome committee carried out the chant with enthusiasm.

Then William and Kate walked forward and rubbed noses with their hosts.

The piper at the airport reflected the large Scottish population in Dunedin.

A small crowd had gathered at the entrance of the airport to cheer and wave to the couple as they got into their car to make their way to a morning church service.

Stepping off the couple's Air Force jet, the Duchess of Cambridge looked elegant as she paraded a New Zealand designer - of sorts - for the first time on the royal tour.

Emelia Wickstead, a favourite of Prime Minister David Cameron's wife Samantha, is New Zealand born but London based.

She paired the coat with a hat by Jane Taylor, a favourite milliner, and the Queen's diamond fern brooch, a gift from the women of Auckland in 1954, for the second time on the trip.

After a day of engagements in Dunedin, Kate and William will spend the night at a luxury £6,420 per night resort in Christchurch, without Prince George. However the lodge was secured for its royal guests for a heavily discounted rate
