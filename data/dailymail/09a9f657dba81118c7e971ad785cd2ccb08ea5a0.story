13 - Premier League appearances

3 - goals 

£40,000 - Falcao’s daily wages

£1.77m - Cost of each of his United goals in wages, not including bonuses (Each of Alexis Sanchez’s 18 goals has cost Arsenal £210,000 in wages)

Radamel Falcao's agent Jorge Mendes has taken a swipe at Louis van Gaal by claiming he would prefer if the striker was playing under Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United.

The Columbia international has endured a difficult time at Old Trafford following a big money loan move from Monaco. He has managed just three goals in 13 Premier League appearances and failed to impress in United's goalless FA Cup draw with minnows Cambridge United on Friday evening.

Van Gaal has only twice played the 28-year-old for a full 90minutes, leading so-called super agent Mendes to suggest his player would have been better off under the former regime of Ferguson who retired following the 2013-14 season.

'I would have liked it if Falcao was with [former Man Utd manager] Sir Alex Ferguson,' Mendes told La Sexta.

'He is a player who needs to play 90 minutes and I don't understand [why he isn't].'

Mendes has previously clashed with the former Holland manager, insisting Falcao will play 'for one of the best teams in the world, if it's United or not,' after he was left out of the squad for a 1-0 defeat to Southampton.

A move to Real Madrid has been ruled out because Karim Benzema is the main striker at the Bernabeu

The Portuguese agent has, however, ruled out a move to Real Madrid becuase Karim Benzema is still the main striker at the Bernabeu.  

'Falcao will play for one of the seven best [teams] in the world next, but Real Madrid have Benzema.'

Mendes also revealed that Portugal defender Pepe is set to stay at Real, despite reports linking him with a January move.

'He is staying at Real Madrid. Last season the president could have sold him and he didn't,' said Mendes.
