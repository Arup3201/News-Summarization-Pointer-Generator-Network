Some could spend all day walking among extinct, wild and giant animals in a natural history museum.

But for this man, that doesn't quite cut it.

Abraham Poincheval is going to climb inside the carcass of a grizzly bear - and stay there for 13 days.

Isolation: Abraham Poincheval climbed into the grizzly bear at the Hunting and Wildlife Museum in Paris today

Crammed inside a space measuring just half a square metre, he will eat, drink, sleep and relieve himself while being filmed by two cameras.

The project, Dans La Peau de l'Ours (Inside the Skin of the Bear), is a visual performance designed to make visitors to the Hunting and Wildlife Museum in Paris think about 'rebirth and the rite of passage'.

Inspired by carcasses he encountered in the Alps, Mr Poincheval's bear is partly reconstructed to accommodate for his needs, and then covered by the original skin and fur.

Director of the museum Claude D'Anphenaise is delighted by the exhibition, which started when Mr Poincheval climbed inside at 11am this morning.

Mr D'Anphenaise told Mail Online: 'It is very interesting and our visitors are very excited.

He has just half a square metre of space, and will only eat food a bear would such as insects and worms

For exercise, he has two rubber exercise bands and some space near his feet where he can stretch out

'He had to work for a long time perfecting his menu to work out what could be kept in there, and working out a way he can get some exercise.

'He has to live in total isolation and be totally self-sufficient in a space not dissimilar from what an astronaut would experience in a rocket. It will be very very difficult for him.

'We have worked with him as well to come up with books for him to read while he is in there.

'Inside he has some more light-hearted books, a bit of escapism. On a table outside, we have a set of books relating to his experience like Walden by Thoreau.

The abstract artist was inspired by carcasses he saw in the Alps, and wants visitors to think about rebirth

Necessities: Two of the legs will store water to sustain him until April 13, the other two will act as his toilet

'Visitors can hold it up to the eyes, and he can read it from inside.

'It is very exciting.'

Having excavated the bear structure, Mr Poincheval has filled up two of the legs with enough water to sustain him until April 13.

The other two legs will be his toilet.

Alongside a kettle, he has a selection of foods that a bear would eat, including dried fruits, insects, and worms.

Claude D'Anphenaise, director of the museum, described Mr Poincheval as a man 'familiar with extreme situations'

Visitors will be able to sit by Mr Poincheval and hold books to the bear's eyes which he can see through

The abstract artist, who has previously lived in a hole underground for a week, will spend the entire time sat semi-upright in a chair.

For movement, he has rubber exercise bands and some room by his feet to stretch.

Describing Mr Poincheval as a man 'familiar with extreme situations', Mr D'Anphenaise said: 'He has already attracted a crowd of people. Everyone wants to go near a big grizzly anyway, and this is even more intriguing for them.'
