A teenage boy has admitted raping a 13-year-old classmate just after they had been in a sex education lesson together.

The student, who cannot be named, led the young victim to a secluded part of the grounds in a North Wales school and then attacked her.

Discussing the class they had been in he  asked her if she wanted to 'try sex' and despite the young girl repeatedly telling him 'no' he pinned her down and raped her.

Guilty: A 13-year-old boy has admitted a raping a classmate after a sex education class, Dolgellau Youth Court, pictured, in North Wales heard

He told her afterwards: 'You can go now' and she did not reveal her ordeal until a year later. 

Sentencing: District Judge Andrew Shaw, who previously represented Princess Diana's butler Paul Burrell, gave the boy a 12-month referral order

The boy, now 15, appeared in Dolgellau Youth Court in North Wales last week and admitted the rape. 

He was put on a 12-month referral order and must sign on the sex offenders list for 30 months after the judge decided not to refer the case to crown court, which can give longer sentences.

Education chiefs in Gwynedd, the Welsh county where it took place, have launched an investigation into the teaching of sex in schools because the attack was carried out just after a sex education class.

A Gwynedd Council spokesman said: 'As soon as this serious allegation was brought to our attention, the matter was immediately referred to North Wales Police for investigation.

'Now that the legal process has been concluded, we will be working with North Wales Police and other relevant partners to carry out a detailed review of the incident to identify whether there are any lessons to be learned.

'Safeguarding the welfare of the county's children is a key priority for Gwynedd Council and our partners.

'When an allegation is presented to us that a young person may have been the victim of a crime, we have detailed processes in place that are then followed in accordance with the relevant all Wales child protection procedures.'

The sexual attack came to light a year after the incident when a school nurse realised the young girl appeared unhappy.

She asked if anything was worrying her and the teenage girl told her about the rape.

The boy is now in foster care and no longer lives in the area. 

He will have to register with police where he is living and where he travels for the next two-and-a-half years.

Most state comprehensives already offer sex education as part of the national curriculum.

But thousands of academies, free and faith schools are not required to teach the national curriculum, meaning they are free to drop the subject.

Provision in primary schools is also patchy, with most not teaching anything until the final years.

This year the Liberal Democrats announced plans to force all state schools, including primaries, to teach sex education.

Nick Clegg’s Schools Minister David Laws committed the party to introducing sex education for all children aged seven and over to help them become ‘good citizens’.

The move, backed by Labour but opposed by the Conservatives, would force thousands of schools to increase the amount of sex education on offer.

Countries such as the Netherlands and Sweden have been held up as examples of a more liberal and open attitude to sex education than the UK.

In the Netherlands, sex and relationship education begins in primary schools for children as young as six. It has one of the lowest teenage pregnancy rates in the world.

British parents retain the right to withdraw their children from sex education classes, and surveys have frequently shown that many oppose school sex education for young children. 

Because District Judge Andrew Shaw decided not send him to Crown Court, where there are higher sentencing powers, the 12-month referral order was the maximum sentence he was able to give.

Sex and relationship education, compulsory from age 11 onwards, involves teaching children about reproduction, sexuality and sexual health.

The Government says it does not promote early sexual activity or any particular sexual orientation.

Some parts of sex and relationship education are compulsory and these biological aspects of sexual maturity and intercourse are part of the national curriculum for science.

Secondary school pupils are taught about relationships, love and care and the responsibilities of parenthood as well as safe sex and contraception.

Guidelines state classes must focus on boys as much as girls, build self-esteem, teach the responsibility and consequences of sexual activity and parenthood and ensure young people understand how the law applies to sexual relationships.

Katie Russell, from rape survivor charity Rape Crisis England and Wales, said anecdotal evidence showed the rape of young teenagers by friends was 'not uncommon'.

Ms Russell said: 'The fact it happened after a sex education class I am sure gives concern about the teaching of sex education in school.

'I would say it highlights the importance of teaching sex and relationship education in schools that focuses not just on the biology and mechanics of sex but about emotions and consent, respect and relationships.

'It is only through genuine education, and much earlier than 13 I would say, that we can help stop this happening.'
