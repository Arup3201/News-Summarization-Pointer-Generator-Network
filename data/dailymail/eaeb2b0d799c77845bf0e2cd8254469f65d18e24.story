The wife of Dominique Strauss-Kahn today launched a furious attack on feminists for trying to ‘dictate to everybody’ how they should live.

Anne Sinclair, 63, is standing by the former International Monetary Fund chief as he faces charges of pimping and using corporate funds to pay for prostitutes.

Using words which will infuriate thousands of women, Ms Sinclair even suggested that feminism had become a device used to unfairly ‘arrest’ philanderers.

It follows two alleged rape accusations against Mr Strauss Kahn, who still faces civil charges in America after a New York chamber maid accused him of attacking her.

But Ms Sinclair, who was today launching a new book about her American art dealer grandfather from who she inherited millions, said coverage of her husband’s legal problems had crossed the boundaries of both ‘voyeurism and the Inquisition’.

Suggesting that society was becoming too conservative, Ms Sinclair even blamed economic problems, saying: ‘People are afraid of the future, hence a more moralising tendency.

‘Words themselves are moving away from their meaning, including (the word) feminism. Feminism is the struggle for women’s freedom.

Accusations: Nafissatou Diallo, pictured, performed a sex act on Mr Strauss-Kahn in New York last May and has accused him of 'sadistic and violent' behaviour

‘Self-proclaimed feminists have turned it into an arresting machine to dictate to everyone how we should live.’

Women like Nafissatou Diallo, the 32-year-old who performed a sex act on Mr Strauss-Kahn in New York last May, have accused him of ‘sadistic and violent’ behaviour.

French judges also found evidence that he had sexually assaulted Tristane Banon, a 32-year-old writer, in a Paris flat, but could not prosecute because the alleged attack happened so long ago.

Some 10 prostitutes have, meanwhile said they had sex at well planned orgies with Mr Strauss-Kahn, who has always denied all the charges against him, saying he simply enjoyed a ‘liberal’ sex life.

Ms Sinclair has frequently expressed her anger at women who say she should leave Strauss-Kahn, even comparing him to Alfred Dreyfus,  a Jewish army officer who was persecuted by the French establishment at the end of the 19th Century.

Ms Sinclair made her latest comments in Paris, where she was promoting her new book about her grandfather Paul Rosenberg, who made millions dealing in works produced by artists including Pablo Picasso.
