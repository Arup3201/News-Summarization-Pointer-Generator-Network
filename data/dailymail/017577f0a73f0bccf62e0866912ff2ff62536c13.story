Alex Salmond marks St George's Day today by 'lovebombing' England in a desperate bid to boost support for the break-up of Britain.

The First Minister will venture over the Border as far as Carlisle to make a speech claiming that a 'strong and enduring friendship' will still endure across the British Isles if Scotland votes to leave the UK in September.

In a speech at Carlisle Cathedral, Mr 
Salmond will insist that people could still live in England and work in 
Scotland if there is a Yes vote - ignoring warnings of passport controls
 and separate currencies.

At the same time David Cameron uses 
the English patron saint's day to urge his countrymen to embrace both 
Scots and the Union.

The Prime Minister issued his own St George's Day message, stressing England's role in creating the enduring 'family of nations' that is the UK.

Both politicians are desperate to win the battle of 'hearts' in a referendum debate that has so far been dominated by economic claims and counter- claims.

Mr Salmond will also unveil plans for 'economic co-operation' with the North of England. Support for the Union is strong in the Borders and many living in and around Carlisle have friends and family who can vote in the referendum.

He will tell them: 'The ties that bind the nations of these islands will continue and flourish after Scotland becomes independent. You will remain Scotland's closest friends, as well as our closest neighbours. Following independence, the social union between the peoples of these islands will remain.

'People would still live in Annan and work in Carlisle, or live in Penrith and work in Lockerbie. Friends and family would continue to visit each other. We would still watch many of the same television programmes.

Scots should not presume that 'free and unfettered' access to all BBC services would continue if there is a Yes vote in the referendum, a former member of the corporation's governing body has warned.

Jeremy Peat, who has served as a member of the BBC Trust, claimed that if Scotland left the UK a deal would have to be done.

Otherwise, he said, digital television services might be 'cut off' just over the Border, 'so essentially there could be a removal of access for the great majority to that television'.

The Scottish Government's White Paper on independence claims 'Scottish viewers and listeners should continue to have access to all their current channels' with 'no additional cost to viewers and listeners as a consequence of independence'.

But others say that Scots might have to pay more.

Mr Peat said that while Scotland, like Ireland, might continue to have access to most BBC services: 'I think the phrase that is used is that it is on a commercial basis.'

'People from Scotland and England would still celebrate personal unions - by getting married in Carlisle Cathedral or perhaps by going to Gretna instead.

'On Monday, there were gun salutes in Stirling, Edinburgh and London to mark the Queen's birthday.

'That would continue, since we would still share a monarchy with the rest of the United Kingdom - just as we did for a century before the parliamentary union of 1707, and just as 16 other Commonwealth countries do now.'

The First Minister recently ridiculed the Prime Minister for using a speech in London to focus on Scottish independence, even though he, too, has now decided he wants to address an English audience.

The flag of St George is flying at 10 Downing Street today, and Mr Cameron has issued his own message to mark England's national day.

He said: 'I want us to reflect on one of England's greatest achievements: its role in the world's greatest family of nations - the United Kingdom. In just five months, the people of Scotland will go to the polls and decide whether they want to remain a part of this global success story.

'So let's prove that we can be proud of our individual nations and be committed to our union of nations because, no matter how great we are alone, we will always be better together.'

In a key speech at London's Olympic velodrome earlier this year, Mr Cameron said losing Scotland would allow the light of this country - which has shone throughout the 'darkest times in human history' - to 'go out forever'.

But Mr Salmond is desperate to claim that a 'social union' would still exist across the British Isles. Last year, he insisted: 'We will not become a foreign country, that's simply ridiculous.

Does anyone think Ireland is a foreign country?' The First Minister has also claimed that a separate Scotland would abandon just one of its 'six unions' - the 'political union' between Scotland and the rest of the UK.

He has argued that five other unions would remain intact: the 'currency union'; membership of the European Union, a defence union through NATO, the Union of the Crowns and a 'social union between the people of these isles'.

But last night Scottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said: 'People in England will certainly recognise a dragon when they see it, particularly a toothless one.

'Meanwhile, the people of Scotland look forward to slaying the independence dragon on September 18.'

A tirade of vile 'cybernat' abuse was unleashed yesterday at Margaret Thatcher after a 24-year-old quote by her was used as an argument for Scottish independence.

Nationalist MSP Sandra White retweeted a picture of the former Prime Minister, who died last year, accompanied by her 1990 statement: 'We English, who are a marvellous people, are really very generous to Scotland.'

The image, which went viral on the social networking site after being posted online by pro-independence supporter Iain MacPherson, was accompanied by a 'Yes' logo.

Twitter user Charles Auchterlonie, whose profile picture includes a Yes logo, wrote: 'Pity we never got the chance to hang her from a lamp-post.' Other users followed suit, with Iain Cameron accusing Lady Thatcher of 'raping and pillaging this country'.
