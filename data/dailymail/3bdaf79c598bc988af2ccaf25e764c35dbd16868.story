Vince Cable today performed some fancy footwork to side step complaints from senior Liberal Democrats that he is getting too close to Labour.

The ballroom dancing Business Secretary is under growing pressure to explain why he has been in talks with Labour leader Ed Miliband while serving in a Cabinet led by Tory David Cameron.

Mr Cable's aides have dismissed the idea that he is preparing to cross the political dancefloor, saying: ‘Vince is not looking for a new partner.'

Fancy footwork: Lib Dem minister Vince Cable who appeared on Strictly Come Dancing in 2010, has denied looking to partner with Labour leader Ed Miliband in a future coalition

In a stinging rebuke, former Lib Dem 
leader Sir Menzies Campbell yesterday warned Mr Cable he could only step out with one coalition
partner with one party at once.

But today Mr Cable insisted he was behaving in a ‘reasonably adult way’ and had ‘nothing to be embarrassed about’.

With critics including many senior Tories giving him low scores for his performance as Business Secretary, Mr Cable took a break from trying to get the economy moving to reveal his tip for this year’s Strictly Come Dancing.

Mr Cable told ITV1's Daybreak: 'Of the field I’ve seen I think Victoria Pendleton… very competitive… very athletic.'

The Olympic gold medal-winning cyclist has insisted she is not feeling the pressure of taking part in the BBC dance show.

But Mr Cable was put on the spot to explain why he has been trying to tango with Mr Miliband.

Mr Cable was an advisor to Labour's John Smith before joining the Liberal Democrats.

While unveiling his overhaul of employment law today, Vince Cable had only one thing on his mind:

His Friday dance lesson.

'I like ballroom and Latin,' he told ITV1's Daybreak. 'I like Rumba.'

After tipping 'very competitive… very athletic' Victoria Pendleton for success in the new series of Strictly, he confessed: 'I have got my own dancing lesson this afternoon.'

Rules on impartiality meant he could not take part in the full Strictly series.

But in December 2010 he was allowed to compete in the Christmas special, partnered with ballroom professional Erin Boag, pictured above

The pair performed the American Smooth and the foxtrot.

Playing down his Labour links today, he said he made contact ‘very, very occasionally’.

'I’ve said this many times before, I think in politics you have to have a reasonably adult way of dealing with people.

'I very, very occasionally talk to Ed Miliband and sometimes his people and, indeed, people across the spectrum.

‘It doesn’t matter, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about, for him or for me, I talk to people across the political spectrum, I think that’s what politics involves, being grown up, not being tribal. 

'I don’t feel remotely embarrassed about that.’

But Sir Menzies disagrees, telling 
the House magazine - which is circulated to MPs- yesterday: ‘The success
of this Coalition depends upon everyone who participates in it being a 
full subscriber.

'I don’t think it helps a partnership to suggest that you may already be looking for another partner.’

Mr Cable revealed he was off to a dance lesson this afternoon, but not before unveiling plans to make it easier for company bosses to get rid of under-performing staff.

The shake-up of employment laws will 
cut how much compensation workers can win in unfair dismissal cases but 
Tory-backed ‘fire at will’ reforms have been abandoned.

Mr
Cable told Daybreak: ‘We are trying to have it both ways because we do 
want the best of both worlds, we want to have confidence in business 
that they can hire people.

'But we want people to go to work knowing that
at the end of the day, if they have a very bad relationship, they do 
have some basic labour rights and protection.’

The limit on unfair dismissal payouts will be reduced to a maximum of 12 months' salary or set at an even lower figure.

And
the current £72,300 cap on pay-offs will also be cut significantly in 
the hope of encouraging small businesses to start hiring more staff.

Chuka Ummuna, Labour’s shadow business secretary, said: ‘Ministers should be making it easier to hire, not easier to fire people.

'We are in a double dip recession due
to this Government's failed economic policies, not because of the 
protections people have at work. Instead of adopting a credible plan for
growth, this Government is attacking rights of every employee in this 
country.

‘Sacrificing people's rights at work is not the way to bolster consumer confidence and get our economy moving again.’

Also among the reforms are plans to giving judges powers to sift through tribunal cases before they reach court to allow them to dismiss weak cases without the need for a hearing.

TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber said: 'Reducing payouts for unfair dismissals will let bad employers off lightly and deter victims from pursuing genuine cases. 

'For all the Government's talk that helping businesses to sack poor performing workers will make them more productive this is little more than a smokescreen to erode hard-won rights.'
