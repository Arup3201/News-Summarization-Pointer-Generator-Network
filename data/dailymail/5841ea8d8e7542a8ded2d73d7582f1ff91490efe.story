America's 10 richest former presidential candidates have been ranked in order of their wealth and surprisingly, the Clintons aren't even in the top five.

Topping the list at No. 1 is Ross Perot - who ran as an Independent in 1992 and 1996 - with an estimated net worth of $4.3 billion, according to research compiled by Wealth-X, a company that helps private wealth firms, luxury brands, and nonproﬁts find potential clients.

Perot made most of his fortune from the sale of Electronic Data Systems and Perot Systems to General Motors and Dell, respectively.

Taking the sixth and seventh slots on the list of wealthiest former presidential candidates are the Clintons, whose net worth is a combined $100 million

Steve Forbes, the chairman and editor-in-chief of Forbes Media, comes in a distant second place with his wealth pegged at $430 million

Ross Perot: $4.3 billion

Steve Forbes: $430 million

John Kerry: $280 million 

Mitt Romney: $220 million

Al Gore: $190 million

Bill Clinton: $100 million

Hillary Clinton: $100 million

Rudy Giuliani: $80 million

John Edwards: $50 million

Jon Huntsman: $30 million

Steve Forbes, the chairman and editor-in-chief of Forbes Media, comes in a distant second place with his wealth estimated at $430 million. Forbes ran two unsucessful campaigns for the Republican nomination in 1996 and 2000. 

Secretary of State John Kerry came in third place ($280 million) followed by two-time presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney ($220 million) and former Vice President Al Gore ($190 million). 

Taking the sixth and seventh slots are the Clintons, whose net worth is a combined $100 million.

The Clintons' wealth was measured as a whole 'to demonstrate the potential financial clout that would be behind Hillary’s presidential campaign if she runs in the 2016 race,' according to Wealth-X.

'The intense scrutiny sparked by being the front-runner Democratic presidential nominee coupled with Hillary's indication that she is out of the gates early have magnified the spotlight on the recent financial vagaries swirling around the Clinton Foundation,' said Wealth-X President David S. Friedman.

'Wealth-X’s assessment of the combined fortunes of the Clinton family puts them in our top 10 ranking. It shows that while their foundation may have been suffering from fundraising challenges, their personal fortunes have continued to grow, driven by their personal speaking tours and appearances.'

Rounding out the bottom of the list are former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani ($80 million), former Democratic Sen. John Edwards ($50 million) and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman ($30 million).
