An elderly couple has been found dead in their suburban Massachusetts home after an apparent murder suicide.

The bodies of Elizabeth Coyne and her husband Donald were discovered on Tuesday when a relative stopped by their Weymouth, Massachusetts home out of concern.

The Boston Globe reports that police found a pistol at the residence that belonged to Mr Coyne but the license had expired on the weapon several years ago.

The exact time of death remains a mystery, as the relative found their dead bodies at 7.12am on Tuesday and police have since taken them for examination and a full autopsy.

No further details were released about the condition of the bodies or if there was any indication about who was the shooter.

'There is no known history of domestic violence,' the Weymouth police department said in a statement.

Donald, 83, and Elizabeth, 81, have two grown children who live about a half-hour drive away.

One neighbor told The Globe that it was the couple's son who discovered their bodies.

The spokesman for the district attorney would not say if either of the Coynes had a history of dementia or any medical issues that would be clear considerations.

'At this point, we don't see anything that is linked to the events of the day,' David Traub said.

It is unclear how long the couple had been married, but their children are believed to be in their mid-to-late forties and prosecutors say the Coynes had been long-term residents of their house.
