Could Anne Hathaway be the next victim of the 'Oscar's Curse?'

The Les Miserables star will be crossing her fingers tonight in hope that she is named the Best Actress in a Supporting Role.

But if her name is called then the odds of her having a happy marriage will be slashed dramatically.

Female winners of the coveted prize are 63 per cent more likely to have a shorter marriage than those who do not win the famous award.

The last casualty of the winner's curse was Sandra Bullock.

Weeks after posing happily on whose marriage to Jesse James dissolved within days of her claiming the prize for her role in The Blind Side, amid accusations he had been unfaithful.

The actress is far from alone in seeing their relationship disintegrate after winning acting's ultimate prize.

The year before Bullock, Kate Winslet won the Academy Award for her performance in The Reader.

Despite appearing to be as close as ever, the couple ended their marriage a year after her win.

Of the 266 married women who have been nominated for the Best Actress award from the beginning of the modern Oscars in 1936 to the present, 159 of them got divorced, or 60 per cent.

Winners of the gong are 1.68 times more likely to head to the divorce court than losers.

Shockingly, studies have shown that there is virtually no change in the status of married men.

Among the other 'victims' of the curse are Julia Roberts, who thanks boyfriend Benjamin Bratt in her victory speech for Erin Brockovich.

Three months later the pair had split up.

Halle Berry became the first black woman to win an Oscar for Monster's Ball and posed ecstatically with husband Eric Benet. However, they separated the following year.

Two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank ducked the curse when she won her award for Boys Don't Cry in 1999.

But her marriage to Chad Lowe did not survive her second award and the pair ended their nine year marriage in 2006.

Cursed: Actress Hilary Swank and husband of nine years Chad Lowe announced their separation a year after she won the Best Actress Oscar for Million Dollar Baby, while Halle Berry and husband Eric Benet lasted longer than most of contemporaries. They split three years after she won the Oscar for Monsters Ball in 2002

Researcher Tiziana Casciaro from the 
University of Toronto said the sudden elevation in fame could play a 
part in the increased divorce rate. 
    
'Winning an Oscar can be construed as a big jump in professional status 
that an actor or actress has in their world and in the eyes of the 
broader audience,' said Casciaro.

“The general social norm kind of requires a man to have higher professional and economic status over the wife.

'So whenever that social norm is violated, both husband and wife may feel discomfort—could be either one of them.'

It is not only modern stars that have succumbed to the curse.

Among the first was Joan Crawford who divorced her third husband in 1946 a year after winning an Oscar for Mildred Pierce.
