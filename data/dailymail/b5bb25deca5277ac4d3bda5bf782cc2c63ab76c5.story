The 73-year-old brother of Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid has been arrested after allegedly driving drunk and fighting with police officers.

Larry Reid was arrested after being found in a parked Lexus SUV in the dirt median of a state highway in southern Nevada, the state his brother represents.

He faces misdemeanor charges of driving under the influence, battery on an officer and possession of a firearm while  under the influence of alcohol. He was also cited for not wearing a seat belt.

He was released after spending the night in Clark Country Jail.

Reid and his car were on a stretch of U.S. 95 inside the Boulder City limits, about 25 miles southeast of Las Vegas.

Nevada Highway Patrol Trooper Loy Hixson said the car, which the trooper on the scene originally believed to be broken down, but on closer inspection found Reid inside. 

The details of  Reid's arrest were not immediately available - including why he was charged with battering an officer and how he sustained injuries to his face. 

A spokeswoman for Senator Reid confirmed Larry Reid is Harry Reid's brother, but wouldn't comment about the arrest saying it was a private matter.

A criminal complaint had not been filed as of Wednesday afternoon and no court date had been set.

Senator Reid is still sporting a painful wound to his eye after a bizarre New Year's Day exercise accident.

He has appeared in Congress since the accident wearing a patch and bandages over his right eye as he recovers from an operation to repair bones in his face and drain the eye of blood.

Senator Harry Reid, 75, is still coping with a painful wound to his eye after a New Year's Day exercise accident. A recent operation to repair bones and drain blood was a success but no guarantee his sight will return

The latest procedure was a success, but does not guarantee his sight will come back.

In interviews shortly before the surgery, Reid explained how he crashed into a wooden cabinet after being sent sprawling by broken exercise equipment - resistance bands that he has been using for many years.

He has told reporters that he finds it difficult to read since the accident, and has been advised by doctors to cut down so as not to strain his good eye.
