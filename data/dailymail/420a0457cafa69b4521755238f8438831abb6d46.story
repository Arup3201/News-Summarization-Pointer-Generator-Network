New Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal will have to do without the services of long-term Red Devils head physio Rob Swire next season as the experienced medical expert has decided to retire.

Swire, who has been at Manchester United for 23 years, has had to assist in helping the likes of David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney recover from injury during their respective careers.

Assistant first team physio Neil Hough will replace Swire with immediate effect as Manchester United returned to training on Friday.

Swire said on making his decision to leave Manchester United: 'It wasn’t easy, it was a big decision.

'I’d been thinking about it for a year or more, working out when it would be right to retire.

'It’s been a fantastic job, a brilliant job, I couldn’t have wanted anything better, but after 23 years at United, and the best of 30 years in total of working pretty much seven days a week, I couldn’t keep doing it forever.

'I had to decide at some point when to stop and now’s the time.'

Former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson and current assistant manager Ryan Giggs have lavished praise on Swire for the work which he has done at the club for over the past two decades.

'We’ve had some fantastic stars at our club but it never affected staff like Rob,' said Ferguson.

'They’ve always helped the players keep their feet on the ground and that’s credit to the kind of club we are.

'I worked with Rob for such a long time and I’m very proud of the job he did. He served the club so well and I wish him all the very best for the future.'

And former Manchester United midfielder Giggs, who required Swire's special attention during periods of his playing days at Old Trafford, added: 'Rob has been a great servant to the club and has been here for as long as I can remember.

'He has always taken great pride in his work and is a true professional.'
