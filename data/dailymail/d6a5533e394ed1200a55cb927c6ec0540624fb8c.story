A transsexual builder who had a £10,000 sex change is suing health bosses after they refused her a breast enlargement operation on the NHS.

Cathy Daniels - born Keith Daniels - wants taxpayers to fund the £5,000 procedure but her GP will not refer her.

The 53-year-old father-of-three, who had gender realignment surgery two years ago, wants the surgery to fully complete her sex change.

She plans to take legal action because without breasts she feels 'half man, half woman'.

Legal action: Transsexual builder Cathy Daniels is suing health bosses after they refused her a breast enlargement operation on the NHS

Miss Daniels, from Burnley, Lancashire, said: 'I have had to face another Christmas half man, half woman, and that is devastating.

'The Primary Care Trust (PCT) has officially reviewed my case and confirmed they will not be funding my breast augmentation.'

Miss Daniels, who first realised she was trapped in the wrong body aged eight, intends to instruct solicitors on her behalf after the festive period next week.

Miss Daniels has enlisted 
the help of transsexual Miranda Lee in her fight for the right to breast augmentation on the NHS.

The 40-year-old (pictured) made headlines in 2009 after she won the right to have £8,000 breast implants – following a battle funded by £10,000 of legal aid.

Miss Lee, from Southend, 
Essex, had gender realignment surgery in 2009, paid for with NHS money.

The process was due to be completed with the breast augmentation, but she was then told the money would not be made available.

Miss Lee, who also complained that she had been left ‘half man, half woman’, attempted suicide and was placed on anti-depressants.

She decided to fight the decision and was granted legal aid in June 2010.

Her case was heard by an NHS review panel in November 2010, which a month later ruled in her favour.

The charity shop worker said she was delighted at the U-turn but wanted compensation for the stress of her ‘inhumane and insensitive’ treatment.

She said: 'Nobody can imagine what it is
like to be trapped in the wrong body and to know that I am only one 
step away from being who I want to be is heartbreaking, especially as 
breasts are a really important part of being a woman.'

Miss Daniels, who blames the failure 
of her four marriages on her taste for cross-dressing, underwent the sex
change at Charing Cross Hospital in London in 2009.

She added: 'I have undergone half the operation, but now I’m being kept in limbo because apparently there is no funds.

'Breasts are a really important part of being a woman and being like this is making me suicidal.

'It’s horrible. I’m neither one or the other. My lower half is a woman but my top half is a man.'

But health bosses said the operation is a cosmetic procedure that is not routinely funded by NHS East Lancashire Primary Care Trust.

A
spokesman said: 'Breast 
augmentation is not a procedure routinely funded by NHS East Lancashire 
as this is considered to be a cosmetic procedure.

'Currently, breast reconstruction is only funded following mastectomy for patients who have had breast cancer.'

Burnley MP Gordon Birtwistle backed the health trust’s stance.

He said: 'Money should be spent on life-saving and urgent-care treatment rather than on cosmetic surgery.

'With everything that has happened in Burnley, including the closure of the children’s ward and A&E department, cosmetic procedures have to become a second priority.'

Ms Daniels, who has HIV, lives with her partner, who she met on the internet.

She
said: 'He is the only thing that stops me doing anything silly but he 
knows how much I need to have the second part of this operation.'
