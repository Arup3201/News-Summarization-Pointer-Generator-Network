Sixteen people were reportedly started vomiting and suffering from red eyes on board a U.S. Airways flight headed to Philadelphia from Israel.

Two passengers and 14 members of the crew were said to have taken ill in the skies during the trans-Atlantic flight Friday, causing the pilot to make an emergency stop in Rome.

A foul odor could be smelled in the cabin,  which could have been due to a malfunction in the ventilation system on board the Airbus A330.

The stricken people on board were taken by ambulance to a medical facility at Fiumicino Airport, near Rome, where the plane touched down at 1.38am local time.

A stench struck the flight at some point between the take-off at 11.30pm from Tel Aviv and the Rome landing three hours later, NBC News reported. 

A spokesman for the airline said: 'The aircraft, an Airbus A330 with 129 passengers, landed safely in Rome early Saturday morning and all passengers have been re-accommodated on other flights. 

'Two passengers and the crew were evaluated by medical personnel and have since been released.' 

The flight had taken off from Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv at 11:30pm Friday, bound for Philadelphia International Airport.
