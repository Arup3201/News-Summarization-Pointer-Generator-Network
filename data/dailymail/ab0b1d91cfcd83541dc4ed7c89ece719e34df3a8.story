A woman has been charged with keeping four men as slaves after they were found in 'squalid conditions' in a lean-to at her home.

The men were found at Vasilica Panaghita's address in Birmingham where they are believed to have been for about a year, West Midlands Police said.

Panaghita, 54, has been charged with four counts of knowingly holding another person in slavery or servitude.

A further eight people, four men and

The four men were found on Monday at Panaghita's address in an inner-city suburb in east Birmingham, police said.

Unemployed Panaghita appeared before magistrates in Birmingham today.

She was remanded in custody to appear at Birmingham Crown Court on April 18.

The men are being cared for by the Salvation Army, police added.

West Midlands Police was aided by the National Crime Agency in the investigation.

The
 unit was established in October to combat immigration and trafficking 
offenders, organised crime, economic crimes and child exploitation.

A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'A woman has appeared at court today in Birmingham charged with slavery offences after four men were found in squalid conditions at her address.

'Police visited the address on Monday as part of enquiries into the welfare of those at the address where they found four men in a lean-to building at the property.

'The men are believed to have been at the address for approximately a year. They are currently being cared for by the Salvation Army.'

The Alum Rock district where the men were found is about two miles from the city centre and played host to a high-profile visit in 2010 by David Cameron, who was shown the regeneration of a community centre.
