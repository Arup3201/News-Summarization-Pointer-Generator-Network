Baroness Warsi has reiterated her anger at the Government's policy towards Israel, saying she quit so she could 'live with myself' - and not because she wants to write a warts-and-all memoir.

The Tory peer, who was the first Muslim woman to sit on Cabinet, dramatically quit as Foreign Office minister on Tuesday, claiming David Cameron's position on the Gaza crisis was 'morally indefensible'.

Mr Cameron was forced to break off from his holiday in Portugal to respond to criticism from the peer that he has failed to condemn Israel's bomb attacks.

Baroness Warsi, who dramatically quit the Government earlier this week, 
has hinted she had been unhappy with Cameron's stance towards the Gaza 
crisis for some time- and said she did not quit so she could publish her memoirs

But sources suggested the real reason for 
her resignation - which was met with fury by the Prime Minister's inner 
circle - was her failure to land a plum job in last month’s reshuffle.

Others suggested one of the reasons she resigned was because she is about to publish her memoirs from her time in Cabinet.

Baroness Warsi was well-known as a fastidious note-taker during meetings and her account of life in the Coalition could prove explosive in the run-up to the general election.

Nicknamed 'the stenographer', publishers hope she will be persuaded to publish them within months.

She has reportedly already received approaches from firms wanting to obtain the rights to her story.

But, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today show this morning, Lady Warsi said: 'Am I about to publish a kiss and tell diary – no I am not. Look, again this detracts from the main issue right now.'

When asked whether she quit after not being promoted above chairman of the Conservative Party, she added: 'If people want to make this about politics, that’s a matter for them.

'The reason why I resigned is the policy. I will not let this became a discussion about politics and tittle tattle and who said what, when.

'My departure clearly says long after politics has come and gone I want to be able to live with myself. And by resigning and stepping down I can live with myself.'

During the interview, Lady Warsi hinted that she had been unhappy with the Government's stance for some time. 

The Tory peer - the first Muslim woman to serve in the Cabinet - today repeated her call for a suspension of arms exports to Israel, saying there is 'no clear commitment' from the UK Government on 'leading the international effort on accountability'

In her resignation letter, Lady Warsi said the Government's 'approach and language during the current crisis in Gaza is morally indefensible, is not in Britain's national interest and will have a long term detrimental impact on our reputation internationally and domestically'

The peer said she hoped her resignation would bring together a 'broad
 coalition' to address issues behind the conflict - so Britain would 'lead the international effort on accountability on both sides'.

She said: 'For me at that moment the 
concern that I had was that even if the ceasefire had held, and I 
sincerely hoped it had, there was still no clear language from the 
Government in relation to the condemnation of what had happened.

'There was no clear commitment that we
 would lead the international effort on accountability on both sides for
 what had happened.'

She 
went on: 'Our language was not there. It was lagging behind. I don't 
think it was just words that would have stopped me from doing what I 
did.

'I think it was a combination of issues. It was the language that we were using, I think it was our lack of support for international justice and accountability for the crimes that had been committed.'

David Cameron was forced to take a break from his holiday in Portugal, pictured, to respond to her resignation. In a response, he said: 'I very much regret that we were not able to speak about your decision beforehand'

She also did not deny claims that she
 would not stayed in post if William Hague was still Foreign Secretary, 
rather than Philip Hammond.

In her resignation letter, she 
praised Hague, saying he was 'probably one of the finest Foreign 
Secretaries this country has seen'.

She responded: 'Look, I think these discussions I’m sure will carry on taking place at a later time.'

Without speaking to the Prime Minister first, Lady Warsi posted the resignation statement on her Twitter feed.

She said: 'With deep regret I have this morning written to the 
Prime Minister & tendered my resignation. I can no longer support 
Govt policy on Gaza.'

It 
came as displaced Gazans began returning to their homes from UN shelters
 after the latest ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect. The 
72-hour truce was agreed by both sides in the month-long conflict which 
has seen hundreds killed.

As part of her resignation, Lady Warsi called for an 
immediate suspension of arms exports to Israel, which has been backed by
 Labour and Liberal Democrats.

Today, she said the Government needed to 'move towards a Middle East policy that is in the long term sustainable'.

She
 cited the UK's decision to abstain when the UN General Assembly voted 
in November 2012 to recognise a Palestinian state as symptomatic of the 
problems.

She added: 'There 
is no point in us talking about a two-state solution if we don't do the 
simple things like recognising Palestine in the way that the majority of
 the world has at the UN.'

Lady Warsi dismissed complaints that she had failed to condemn thousands of rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas, or the actions of Islamic extremists in Iraq.

She said: 'This dispute in Israel and this crisis is not a crisis between two religions. It has therefore got nothing to do with whether or not someone is a Christian or a Muslim or indeed Jewish.

'I have a very long and proud history of speaking out on the issue of anti-semitism, on speaking out against the persecution of Christians worldwide. I led the government effort on freedom of religion and belief.

'In relation to Hamas, as I said in my very first interview, Hamas is a terrorist organisation and I have no doubt they have not acted in the best interest of the Palestinian people.

'But I also made it clear that Israel as an occupying power has a responsibility not just to the Israelis but also to the people that it occupies.

'I have always believed in the right of Israel to exist - not just exist, but exist in a secure way.

'I do not believe that this is a way they needed to conduct themselves in order to achieve their aims.'

Last night Labour upped pressure on the Government to suspend arms exports to Israel as rocket fire and air strikes resumed.

Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander called for the publication of a Whitehall review of existing licences. He also insisted that Lib Dem ministers should act to block exports, rather than merely posturing in public on the issue.

Born in West Yorkshire, Lady Warsi became the first Muslim to sit in Cabinet when she was made Conservative Party co-chairman following the 2010 election.

She was later moved to the post of ‘senior minister of state’ at the Foreign Office and minister for faith and communities in Mr Cameron’s 2012 reshuffle – a move widely regarded as a demotion. The peer was still allowed to attend Cabinet meetings.

Despite the snub, however, she apparently harboured hopes of a promotion back to full Cabinet in last month’s reshuffle.

But in fact, she has been out of favour for some time with the Conservative establishment.

Nevertheless, there are concerns among some Tories that – with the election just nine months away – the Government’s Gaza stance could cost them the support of Muslim voters in key constituencies.

In her resignation letter, Lady Warsi wrote: ‘My view has been that our policy in relation to the Middle East peace process generally, but more recently our approach and language during the current crisis in Gaza is morally indefensible, is not in Britain’s national interest and will have a long-term detrimental impact on our reputation.’

She added: ‘Early evidence from the Home Office and others shows the fall-out of the current conflict…and our response to it becoming a basis for radicalisation could have consequences for us for years to come.’

In the letter, she also referred to 'great unease across the Foreign 
Office amongst both Ministers and senior officials' about the 
Government’s policy on Gaza - but said today she would not 'name names'.

In his reply, Mr Cameron expressed ‘regret’ that they had been unable to speak before she decided to go.

‘Of course, we believe that Israel has the right to defend itself,’ he wrote.

‘But we have consistently made clear our grave concerns about the heavy toll of civilian casualties and have called on Israel to exercise restraint, and to find ways to bring this fighting to an end.’
