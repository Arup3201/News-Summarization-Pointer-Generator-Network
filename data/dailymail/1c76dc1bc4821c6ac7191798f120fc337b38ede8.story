A huge number of fathers are missing important milestones in their children's lives due to increasing hours and hefty workloads. 

Almost two thirds (62 per cent) have missed a parents' evening, while one in five couldn't attend their child's last school sports day.

It also emerged that just under one third of fathers have missed 'most' or 'all' of their child's Christmas plays and a fifth said they were 'lucky' if they caught one bath time a month.

More than half of fathers miss first steps and first words - and it's reportedly due to increasing hours at work

A similar figure confessed they have no idea what their child's favourite book is due to missing their bed-times when working late, according to a new study of 1,000 UK fathers of children aged 16 and under.

A significant 53 per cent of fathers have missed out on big milestones in their children's lives such as first steps, first words and even school awards ceremonies.

The average father loses out on three significant family events every month, but feels regret over missing smaller events such as baths or reading-time as often as twice a week.

And six in ten confessed to only spending quality time with their children at weekends, with 'long working hours' and being 'too knackered' averting them from valuable family time.

Too much overtime and travelling for business were other top reasons for missing week nights at home, with the gym and other commitments also getting in the way.

And for fathers who do eventually get home, a shattered one in ten confessed to hitting the hay as soon as they get through the door, whilst others stated they just want some time to themselves after a hard day at work.

Fathers are missing out on sports days and bath times - but research shows quality time helps development

The sofa is the prime location for most tired dads, who will usually spend their evening in front of the TV with a beer or a glass of wine.

But the many evenings dads spend recuperating doesn't make them happy, the results showed.

Many of the hard-working fathers said they find it difficult to maintain a work-life balance, and over half have questioned whether their career is worth the time they miss out on at home.

And sadly, a considerable 32 per cent of the dads polled said there were still many playtime activities they have never done due to being busy with their careers.

And almost one in ten said that although they want to, they have never dressed up as their child's favourite character, gone kite-flying or taught them to swim.

The poll found over one in eight have never gotten around to building their kids a den or tree house, whilst others haven't cheered on at their kids' football matches.

Going on long walks, playing pretend and visiting the cinema were among the top playtime activities dads wished they could do more of with their children, as well as reading comics, sleeping outside in a tent and playing board games. 

A number of fathers claimed that if they had more time they would help their children to ride a bike, invent science experiments and teach them self-defence techniques, whilst over a fifth would enjoy improving on their kids' football skills.

Many felt that if they were there to cheer them on at events and spend time with them when they got home from school, it would improve the relationship between them.

But despite their regrets, fathers had good intentions behind their absence - the research showed that a massive six in ten thought that putting his job first is an unavoidable factor to supporting a happy family.

A spokesman for notonthehighstreet.com, which carried out the study, said: 'We all know it can often be difficult to be home regularly, and it seems this is especially true of the UK's busy dads - try as they might, missing out on quality family time is sometimes unavoidable.

'The pressure to meet deadlines at work balanced with the knowledge that you're losing out on precious memories can be hugely frustrating and challenging. 

'The results show that modern dads certainly are under stress and strains by putting in normal working hours and more, whilst also trying to make birthday parties or parents' evenings.'

'It's clear from this study into modern UK fathers that working hours are a real constraint on family life. It's only as we get older that we realise the lengths our parents go to ensure that we have a great childhood. And with Fathers' Day coming up it's a great opportunity to treat the nations dads and show our gratitude.'

Notonthehighstreet.com want to encourage dads to launch their own flexible, creative business and tap into their passions and hobbies as an alternative to the 9 to 5

Notonthehighstreet.com has launched a project called the Dadpreneur Movement to help shine a light on the issues and challenges facing the modern working father. 

The company has teamed up with working fathers like Olympic gold medalist James Cracknell and Michelin starred chef and owner of The Social Company Jason Atherton to discuss the issues. 

Cracknell and Atherton will form part of a panel aimed at getting dads to get their creative juices flowing in order to achieve success whilst also maintaining a healthier worklife balance and making sure they have one on one bonding time with their kids at the same time.

A notonthehighstreet.comspokesperson said: 'Through our Dadpreneur Movement we want to encourage dads to launch their own flexible, creative business and tap into their passions and hobbies as an alternative to the 9 to 5.'

Psychotherapist Phil Hodson, who will also be on the panel of working fathers, says: 'Numerous studies have shown the benefits of play for children. A dad spending time with his children and participating in creative play is invaluable to a child's development. Not only does it have huge emotional benefits, it can help with cognitive development, social development and physical development.'
