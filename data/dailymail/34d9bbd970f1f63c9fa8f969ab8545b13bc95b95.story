Former Indiana and current Florida schools chief Tony Bennett and his staff raised a charter school's grades despite poor test scores.

Bennett and his staff gave the school run by a prominent Republican donor an 'A', after test scores in algebra initially earned it a 'C', emails obtained by AP showed.

The schools chief is renowned for promising to hold 'failing' schools accountable.

But when it appeared the Indianapolis charter school run by Christel DeHaan might receive a poor grade, Bennett's education team frantically overhauled his signature 'A-F' school grading system to improve the school's marks.

'They need to understand that anything less than an A for Christel House compromises all of our accountability work,' Bennett wrote in a Sept. 12 email to then-chief of staff Heather Neal, who is now Gov. Mike Pence's chief lobbyist.

The emails, which also show Bennett discussed with staff the legality of changing just DeHaan's grade, raise unsettling questions about the validity of a grading system that has broad implications.

Indiana uses the A-F grades to determine which schools get taken over by the state and whether students seeking state-funded vouchers to attend private school need to first spend a year in public school.

Christel DeHaan has given more than $2.8 million to Republicans since 1998, including $130,000 to Bennett

They also help determine how much state funding schools receive.

A low grade also can detract from a neighborhood and drive homebuyers elsewhere.

Bennett, who now is reworking Florida's grading system as that state's education commissioner, reviewed the emails Monday morning and denied that DeHaan's school received special treatment.

He said discovering that the charter would receive a low grade raised broader concerns with grades for other 'combined' schools - those that included multiple grade levels - across the state.

'There was not a secret about this,' he said.

'This wasn't just to give Christel House an A. It was to make sure the system was right to make sure the system was face valid.'

However, the emails clearly show Bennett's staff was intensely focused on Christel House, whose founder has given more than $2.8 million to Republicans since 1998, including $130,000 to Bennett and thousands more to state legislative leaders.

Other schools saw their grades change, but the emails show DeHaan's charter was the catalyst for any changes.

Bennett rocketed to prominence with the help of former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and a national network of Republican leaders and donors, such as DeHaan.

Bennett is a co-founder of Bush's Chiefs for Change, a group consisting mostly of Republican state school superintendents pushing school vouchers, teacher merit pay and many other policies enacted by Bennett in Indiana.

Though Indiana had had a school ranking system since 1999, Bennett switched to the A-F system and made it a signature item of his education agenda, raising the stakes for schools statewide.

Bennett consistently cited Christel House as a top-performing school as he secured support for the measure from business groups and lawmakers, including House Speaker Brian Bosma and Senate President Pro Tem David Long.

But trouble loomed when Indiana's then-grading director, Jon Gubera, first alerted Bennett on Sept. 12 that the Christel House Academy had scored less than an A.

'This will be a HUGE problem for us,' Bennett wrote in a Sept. 12, 2012 email to Neal.

Neal fired back a few minutes later, 'Oh, crap. We cannot release until this is resolved.'

By Sept. 13, Gubera unveiled it was a 2.9, or a 'C'.

A week-long behind-the-scenes scramble ensued among Bennett, assistant superintendent Dale Chu, Gubera, Neal and other top staff at the Indiana Department of Education.

They examined ways to lift Christel House from a 'C' to an 'A', including adjusting the presentation of color charts to make a high 'B' look like an 'A' and changing the grade just for Christel House.

It's not clear from the emails exactly how Gubera changed the grading formula, but they do show DeHaan's grade jumping twice.

'That's like parting the Red Sea to get numbers to move that significantly,' Jeff Butts, superintendent of Wayne Township schools in Indianapolis, said in an interview with The Associated Press.

DeHaan, who opened the Christel House Academy charter school in Indianapolis in 2002 and has since opened schools in India, Mexico and South Africa, said in a statement Monday that no one from the school ever made any requests that would affect Christel House's grades.

Current Indiana schools chief Glenda Ritz's office declined comment on the emails.

Ritz, a Democrat, defeated Bennett in November with a grass-roots campaign driven by teachers angered by Bennett's education agenda.

Bennett said Monday he felt no special pressure to deliver an "A" for DeHaan. Instead, he argued, if he had paid more attention to politics he would have won re-election in Indiana.

Yet Bennett wrote to staff twice in four days, directly inquiring about DeHaan's status. Gubera broke the news after the second note that 'terrible' 10th grade algebra results had 'dragged down their entire school.'

Bennett called the situation 'very frustrating and disappointing' in an email that day.

'I am more than a little miffed about this,' Bennett wrote. 'I hope we come to the meeting today with solutions and not excuses and/or explanations for me to wiggle myself out of the repeated lies I have told over the past six months.'

Bennett said Monday that email expressed his frustration at having assured top-performing schools like DeHaan's would be recognized in the grading system, but coming away with a flawed formula that would undo his promises.

When requested a status update Sept. 14, his staff alerted him that the new school grade, a 3.50, was painfully close to an 'A'. Then-deputy chief of staff Marcie Brown wrote that the state might not be able to 'legally' change the cutoff for an 'A'.

'We can revise the rule,' Bennett responded.

Over the next week, his top staff worked arduously to get Christel House its 'A'.

By Sept. 21, Christel House had jumped to a 3.75. Gubera resigned shortly afterward.

He declined comment Monday.

The emails don't detail what Gubera changed in the school formula or how many schools were affected.

Indiana education experts consulted for this article said they weren't aware the formula had been changed.
