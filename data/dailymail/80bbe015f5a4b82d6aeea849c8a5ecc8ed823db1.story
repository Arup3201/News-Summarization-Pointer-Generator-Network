A teenage lesbian with a Mexican father and an African-American mother is hoping to win the Miss Carolina crown when she competes at the contest this summer.

Analouisa Valencia, 19, is hoping to rattle the pageant stereotypes by becoming the first lesbian in her conservative home state to take the crown, before heading to the national competition.

She has already scored the title in her home town of Lyman and believes it was a victory for equality. Now she wants to take the issues center stage in the state competition in July.

'I want to show the judges who I really 
am,' she told CNN. 'I want to show them how passionate I am about my 
platform, how passionate I am for being an advocate for equality.'

Fight for equality: Analouisa Valencia, who is a lesbian, hopes to win the Miss South Carolina crown this July

Valencia, who has a long-time girlfriend, came out in the ninth grade to mixed responses from her parents.

'My mom at first said, "Well, I don’t support it, but I love you so I’ll support you." She's OK with it now, but it's been a couple of years,' she told Advocate.

'My dad at first was very, very, very furious. I think it took him a good three weeks to finally accept the fact that I was just going to be who I was and be proud of it.'

She started dating her girlfriend, Tamyra Bell, in 2010 and took her to her high school prom. Bell, 20, has been involved in the pageants and helps Valencia pick outfits for the shows.

Valencia explained that teachers and the community have shown them real support.

'In Spartanburg, I think we’re one of the most well-known couples,' she told Advocate. 'Everybody loves us, we don't know why.'

Yet she knows she still has a long way to go: They reside in a state which bans same-sex marriage and does not give employment, housing or hate-crime protections for LGBT people.

Valencia is not only fighting for equality for racial minorities and LBGT teens, but also for people with special needs, as she coaches Special Olympics gymnasts.

She currently takes classes at Spartanburg Community College and eventually wants to earn a business degree at the University of South Carolina before setting up a gymnastics school.

Ryan Wilson, the executive director of the South Carolina Equality Coalition, a statewide LGBT civil rights group, called her decision to enter the pageant 'courageous'.

'I think it takes a lot of courage for any young person to live openly and authentically. We are extremely proud of Analouisa,' he told CNN. 'She can be a role model for LGBT youth.'

But she is aware that just because she is a lesbian, it is not that alone which should win her the title.

'Miss South Carolina should be a great role model, but her sexual 
orientation shouldn’t define her as a person,' she said. 'And it shouldn't define 
her getting a crown.'
