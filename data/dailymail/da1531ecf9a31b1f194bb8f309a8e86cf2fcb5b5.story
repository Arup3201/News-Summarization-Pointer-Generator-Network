A Pennsylvania man turned his mother's day care center into a heroin den once the kids left for the day, according to police.

Ryan Varano told authorities he and another man, Christian Kehler, would use Jesus' Lil Helpers Daycare to sell and use heroin on nights and weekends, The Shamokin News Item reported.

Police told the newspaper the men used children's tables, chairs and cabinets at the Shamokin day care center to package heroin and load syringes.

Varano, Kehler and Frederick Russo were charged Saturday after someone at the daycare building called police to report an overdose, the Shamokin News Item reported.

Citing court documents, the newspaper reported that police and emergency workers revived 37-year-old Kehler with CPR and naloxone.

Varano, Kehler and Russo are reportedly facing criminal conspiracy, possession of an illegal substance, and possession with intent to deliver charges. 

Police told the Shamokin News Item that Russo was not there when Kehler overdosed.

Online court records didn't include information on lawyers to comment on the charges. 

Police have said children's tables, chairs and cabinets at the Shamokin day care center were used to package heroin and load syringes

District Attorney Ann Targonski told the newspaper 'It's upsetting to realize that heroin is being dealt in the same places where we send our children to be safe while we work.

'This particular instance occurred during hours when the day care was not in operation.

'However, the idea that people are doing drugs and selling drugs in what we would consider a safe haven for children is concerning.'

Varano's mother Kelly L. Ebersole has told the Shamokin News Item she is going to press charges against Varano and Kehler.

'(Varano) had no right to be in here,' she told the newspaper. 'He had no right to bring anybody in there.'
