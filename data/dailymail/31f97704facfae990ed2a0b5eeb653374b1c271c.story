David Cameron has waded into the growing diplomatic row over China's decision to ban a group of MPs  travelling to Hong Kong amid growing political alarm over Beijing's crackdown on democracy protesters.

MPs on the Foreign Affairs Committee have been warned they will be denied entry if they go ahead with a planned visit to the former British colony.

The Prime Minister this morning attacked the decision as 'mistaken and counter productive', adding: 'It only serves to amplify concerns about the situation in Hong Kong rather than diminishing concerns.'

David Cameron - with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on a state visit to the country last year - said the decision to ban MPs 'only serves to amplify concerns about the situation in Hong Kong'

It came after committee chairman Sir Richard Ottaway said his committee of MPs had been told by the Chinese embassy that they would be turned back if they tried to enter Hong Kong.

The MPs had been planning to visit Hong Kong as part of an inquiry into its relations with the UK 30 years after the joint declaration which led to the handover to China in 1997.

The move comes amid continuing protests by pro-democracy campaigners in Hong Kong who have been demanding the right to choose their own leaders without interference from Beijing.

Sir Richard accused the Chinese authorities of acting in an ‘overtly confrontational manner’ and said that he would now be pressing for an emergency Commons debate.

‘I have been informed by the Chinese embassy that if we attempt to travel to Hong Kong we will be refused entry,’ he said.

‘We are a committee of elected Members of Parliament from a democratic nation who wish to scrutinise British diplomatic work in Hong Kong.

‘The Chinese government are acting in an overtly confrontational manner in refusing us access to do our job.

‘I shall be asking the Speaker tomorrow to grant an emergency debate on the floor of the House.’

Mr Cameron's official spokesman said he shared Sir Richard’s concerns. He said: ‘The Prime Minister's view is that the decision with regard to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee is a mistaken one.

‘We will continue to have a dialogue with the Chinese authorities on this, both through the Foreign Office here in London with the Chinese Embassy in London and through our embassy in Beijing.

‘The argument that we will be taking forward with the Chinese authorities is that the reason why the Prime Minister thinks it is a mistaken decision is because it is counter-productive. It only serves to amplify concerns about the situation in Hong Kong, rather than diminishing concerns.’ 

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond is facing pressure to confront China over their threat to block a group of MPs visiting China

Hundreds of pro-democracy protesters confronted Hong Kong police yesterday, stepping up their movement for democratic reforms after being camped out on the city’s streets for more than two months.

Student protest leaders told a large crowd rallying at the main protest site outside government headquarters that they would escalate their campaign by surrounding the building.

The protesting against proposals which they claim will see elections in the former colony rigged in favour of Beijing puppet candidates.

They are demanding that the Hong Kong government scrap a plan by China’s Communist leaders to use a Beijing chosen panel to screen candidates for Hong Kong’s leader in 2017 elections.
