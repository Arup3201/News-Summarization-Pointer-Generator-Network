Whether Australians are partying it up on a beach or planning the wedding of their dreams in sun-soaked Thailand, when troubles arise, they always turn to the Australian Embassy.

Given the fact that three Australians die in Thailand every 72 hours, the embassy staff are constantly on call and nothing is off limits, making it one of the busiest embassies in the world. 

For the first time ever, Australian TV cameras have been granted permission to film inside the Australian Embassy in Thailand as they deal with the Thai authorities and rogue Australians. 

The cameras captured everything from scam-artist love-rats to dream holiday bust ups and passport dilemmas.

The team of ten Australians who work at the Embassy, along with nine others, endure the gruelling task of monitoring the activities of Australian holiday-makers.

Following five years of discussions and negotiations with Thai diplomats, Channel 9 has finally gained access to the Australian Embassy in Thailand in their four-part series The Embassy: Bangkok.

Dramatic scenes unfold as the show follows characters from the embassy dealing with problem Aussies.

'Australians are travelling more than ever. We've never looked inside an actual embassy from the perspective of the people who deal with the consequences and what it means for Australians,' Executive Producer Laurie Critchley told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's really exciting it's the first time it's happened in Australia,' she said.

A group of four Australians who seem to have indulged in one too many Thai buckets need the assistance of the Embassy. After a vicious punch-up, the Embassy has to persuade the gang to do the right thing before they wind up in jail.

'Too many Australians come over here and think they can do anything and they cant,' a volunteer helping to keep Australians off the streets in Thailand said.

'It's embarrassing when you get that kind of ignorance from Australians,' consular manager Trudy McGowan said.

22-year-old Cameron Woodger makes an appearance on the program after overstaying his visa for the sake of 'love'. After falling for a Thai woman, Cameron can't bear to leave her but this isn't the fist time Cameron has flouted the law and Thai officials might not be so easy on him this time.

While the program features it's share of uplifting stories with happy endings, there are some shocking scenes - from violent Australians to the horrendous conditions of the Thai jails. 

'You do get shocked,' Executive Producer Craig Graham said.

'You forget how easy is it to get in trouble in a different country with a different culture.' 

The Embassy is alerted to a 43-year-old Australian called David, who has been jailed for overstaying his visa in a remote prison near the Burmese border. 

David has been locked up for three weeks in a cell with 120 other prisoners. He is dangerously ill with pneumonia and needs the help of the embassy.

'I'm living in a cage with 120 men, you start thinking in your mind what if I'm in here forever,' a distraught David said.

'It's my worst nightmare, I've never been in trouble with the law. I'm more upset than I've ever been in my life.'

Meanwhile, Australian Matt and his partner Wayne are embroiled in a surrogacy scandal and it's touch-and-go whether their fraternal twins, Jaxon and Logan will make it across the Thai border.

They are unsure whether their hired surrogate will sign a release form for their baby boys' Australian passports. 

'There's always the fear that she has more rights than we do because she's on the birth certificate as the mother,' Matt says.

While in another part of town, a young Aussie found out the hard way that you should always keep your passport in a safe place.

'While it's funny, there's a profound concept that if you're abroad and you don't have a passport you're buggered,' Executive Producer Craig Graham said.

The crew spent five months filming Australian antics in Thailand and while they acknowledge that there are some laughs along the way, they also reveal that some of the scenes are heartbreaking to watch. 

'The Embassy staff are an insightful, interesting and committed bunch of people,' Ms Critchley said.

'One of the things that makes the show so enjoyable is that each story is so completely different. Each of them has a revealing moment and the Embassy helps them some through incredibly different times.' she said. 

'I'm hoping people recognise what the embassy does for us,'  Craig Graham said.

'I certainly think there will be an enormous appreciation for the work they do. It shows something on TV that hasn't been shown before.'

The Embassy: Bangkok airs this Sunday October 19 at 6:30pm on Channel 9.
