Three Ivy League schools have held their top spots in this year's survey of the best U.S. colleges, it was announced today.

According to research on  1,800 schools in the 30th edition of Best Colleges, Princeton University cam first for the second-year running, Harvard held on to second place and Yale again came in a close third.

All the schools in the top ten maintained their high-ranking place - apart from Dartmouth College in New Hampshire which dropped from tenth place to 11th spot.    

Top pick: Princeton University in New Jersey was voted the best college in the U.S. for the second year running, according to the 30th edition of Best Colleges 

NATIONAL UNIVERSITIES 

Best in class: In a ranking of the best universities, Princeton, Harvard and Yale took the top spots 

Princeton in New Jersey, where tuition and fees cost $41,820 a year for 2014-15, came out on top, in part thanks to being 'the first university to offer a "no loan" policy to financially needy students, giving grants instead of loans to accepted students who need help paying tuition'. 

Harvard, which has almost 7,000 students enrolled at its Cambridge campus, costs $43,938 to attend but its achievement of having the largest endowment of any school in the world was noted.

Yale's 12 residential colleges that encourage a supportive learning and socializing were also noted by the research.

Among liberal arts colleges, Massachusetts' Williams College once again came out on top with Amherst College in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania's Swarthmore College, in second and third places respectively.

There are almost 50 lists included in the in-depth college study. For the first time, each campus's safety statistics were also included along with three-year federal loan default rates, from the Department of Education.  

Separate tables also ranked the regional universities - schools which offered mainly bachelor programs - and regional colleges, schools that grant less than half their degrees in the liberal arts.

LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGES 

Among the liberal arts schools, Massachusetts' Williams College came out on top - but it has one of the priciest tuitions at more than $48,310 a year 

The schools are judged on 16 categories including academic excellence, graduation rates and how many freshmen carry on into sophomore year.

The Best Colleges guide also has schools that are easier to get into for students without a gleaming A-grade report card - most notably Penn State and California's Soka University of America, according to Yahoo. 

A breakdown of the best value schools was also offered, weighing both the quality of the teaching and programs alongside getting the most out of your money. 

Harvard and Amherst came out in top in their categories in this respect while public colleges, the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and the University of California-Santa Cruz were also winners.  

Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts came in second place on the list of the best colleges in the U.S. following detailed research for prospective students
