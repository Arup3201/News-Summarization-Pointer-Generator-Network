It is said the pen is mightier than the sword, and this latest model certainly shows how powerful pens can be - literally.

The £25 ($39) Power Pen doubles up as a stylus and phone charger for a wide range of gadgets and other electronics.

It contains a 700mAH battery, a microUSB port for Android phone and tablets, e-readers and portable speakers, plus a Lightning Connector for the latest range of Apple devices.

Plus, it works as a stylus for any touchscreen device, as well as a regular ballpoint pen at the twist of the tip.

The built-in battery isn’t enough to charge a device completely, but it can give gadgets a much-needed boost until the owner gets home.

Firebox told MailOnline it is the equivalent of roughly  a third of a smartphone’s battery life, but this depends on the device being charged. 

When the pen’s battery is running low, it can be charged using a built-in USB connector.

The Power Pen is available to pre-order, in black or gold, from London-based Firebox for £24.99 ($39). It will then ship on 29 December.

The Mighty Power Wallet resembles a typical leather wallet, but conceals a battery and micro USB port that can be used to charge devices such as tablets, smartphones and e-readers.

It also has all the usual pockets and slots for notes and cards, as well as a separate sealed area for coins.

It costs £75 ($119) from Firebox and a larger Power Purse is on sale too. 

‘On the surface it's a sleek, brushed-aluminium stylus, but with just a few gestures you can unlock the full power of this mighty pen,’ the site’s description explains.

‘Give the tip a quick swivel and a ballpoint pen starts to emerge.

‘Twist off the other end to access the built-in battery with tips for both lightning and microUSB - it's got your back whether you're Apple or Android.

‘Pop the cap to reveal the familiar USB connector and you're ready to start re-charging.

‘It's truly the only pen you'll ever need. Just make sure you don't let your friends and colleagues get wind of its full potential.’

In 1983 James Bond film Never Say Never Again, the spy also had a multi-use pen. His fountain pen (pictured), however, could fire an explosive charge, and was used to kill villainess Fatima Blush
