A Georgia high school student may be banned from walking in her graduation ceremony because of a joke she made in her yearbook that spelled out 'back that a** up' using the periodic elements.

Paris Gray, 17, senior class vice president at Mundy's Mill High School in Clay County, included the joke to accompany her yearbook photo, WSBTV reports.

Upset: Paris Gray, pictured, says she was told she can't walk in her graduation ceremony or give her  speech because of her yearbook quote

Inspirational message? Gray said her quote is really about starting over

The yearbook quote reads 'When the going gets tough just remember to Barium, Carbon, Potassium, Thorium, Astatine, Arsenic, Sulfur, Uranium, Phosphorus.'

When the elements' symbols are used, they read 'back that a** up.'

'Basically, it was me just saying start all over again,' she told WSBTV. 'You have to go back and start all over.'

Revealed: When the words are decoded they spell a racier message

Gray told the station she received an in-school suspension and that an assistant principal said she cannot walk in her graduation ceremony or giver her scheduled speech next week.

'It just completely destroyed me, and my mom's been telling me don't let it ruin my happiness but it's like really taking a big toll,' she said.

'My first reaction was, you are such a nerd,' mother Zarinah Woods told the station. The district superintendent and school principal were scheduled to meet with Woods on Tuesday morning.

The school declined a request for comment from MailOnline.
