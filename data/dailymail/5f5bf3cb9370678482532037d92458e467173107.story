Manchester City have had enquiries from Inter Milan and Roma for Matija Nastasic who they want to sell with Eliaquim Mangala expected to arrive from Porto.

They would prefer to move him abroad although Arsenal would guarantee quicker payment.

Arsene Wenger will move for a new centre-half if captain Thomas Vermaelen leaves for Manchester United.

Talented: Matija Nastasic impressed for the champions Manchester City last season

On his way: Could Nastasic have played his last game for Manchester City?

And Nastasic is on the Gunners’ radar as they make plans for the exit of Vermaelen.

The Serbia international was watched extensively by Arsenal scouts during his time at Fiorentina, but City moved quickly to snap up Nastasic in 2012 as he developed a reputation as one of the best emerging defenders in Europe.

Despite missing out to City, the North London club remain keen on Nastasic and are set to revive their interest should Vermaelen leave.

Nastasic’s future at the Etihad Stadium is unclear this summer due to the pending arrival of Mangala.

Experience: Thomas Vermaelen is still a top player on his day

Frustrating: Vermaelen has endured his fair share of injury woes over the last few years

Whether Vermaelen completes a move to Old Trafford remains to be seen, with the Gunners far from convinced about selling their skipper.

The Belgium international has less than 12 months on his existing deal meaning he can leave on a free transfer next summer.

But Wenger knows letting Vermaelen go, particularly after the departure of fourth-choice centre-back Bacary Sagna, would leave him alarmingly short of options in the position.

It is understood Wenger would give serious consideration to a player-swap deal with United.

Wenger has shown firm interest in United central defenders Chris Smalling and Phil Jones in the past, and may look to include either in a deal for Vermaelen.
