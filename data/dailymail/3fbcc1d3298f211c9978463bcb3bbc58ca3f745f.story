If you're looking for a beachfront property with great views and plenty of space, Cleethorpes Pier seems a bargain at £400,000.

But you'd be buying a business rather than a holiday home.

The 335ft (102m) working pleasure pier in Lincolnshire boasts a nightclub, a 600-seat theatre, cafe and bar. It was most recently operating as The Pavilion nightclub and Tides Bar And Restaurant.

I do like to be beside the seaside: Current owner Bryn Ilsley bought the Victorian pier in Lincolnshire two years ago and spent £200,000 improving it, but says he is selling in order to invest elsewhere

Current owner Bryn Ilsley bought the Victorian pier two years ago and spent £200,000 improving it, but says he is selling it in order to invest elsewhere.

The historic pier first opened in 1873. It was built by Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire railway company for £8,000 in an attempt to attract tourists to the area and the walkway was 1200ft long before it was partly demolished during the Second World War.

Since World War I, the pier has changed hands numerous times and has gone through a series of redevelopments and projects to try and revive its flagging fortunes.

Over the years entertainment at the pier has included bingo and wrestling, and until last month it was used as a nightclub.

The venue closed earlier this month causing some upset when staff were informed they had lost their jobs via text message.

Tim Mickleburgh, honorary vice president of the National Piers Society, said he was optimistic that somebody would buy the pier and turn the place around.

He said: 'It's very disappointing because the the owners seem to have put a lot of money in to it and tried different various attractions over the years.'

The historic town of Cleethorpes is classed as a seaside resort, but Cleethorpes actually sits on the Humber estuary. The sea at Cleethorpes is actually the mouth of the Humber. This means that bathers are separated from the sea by several hundred yards of sand at low tide.

The sea front provides views of shipping traffic entering and leaving the Humber for the ports of Grimsby, Immingham, Hull and Goole. The main shopping area is St Peter's Avenue.

Two large fortifications known as the Humber Forts are visible in the mouth of the river. On a clear day, the lighthouse situated on Spurn Point can be seen with the naked eye from the North Beach.

There is a Royal National Lifeboat Institution station, which is near the pier and next to the Coastguard on Central Promenade.

The auction will be held by Swindells Auctioneers on February 2 at the Cleethorpes Pier.

What a view: Whoever buys the pier will have a great deal of space and an attractive location to make use of
