The partying and celebrating has continued for 2014 Stanley Cup winners the Los Angeles Kings with an intimate parade through their home cities along the coastline.

Yesterday the team held a victory parade through the South Bay beach cities, where many of the players and much of their die-hard fan base live.

The parade 
started at 3pm and spent about 90 minutes travelling through the beach 
cities of Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach.

After winning their second Stanley Cup in three years their South Bay fans turned out in numbers to celebrate it

Hermosa 
Beach Mayor Michael DiVirgilio had told the LA Times he was honoured the 
players wanted to share their success with the community.

'They
 live and play, raise their families and hang out with their friends in 
the beach cities,” he said.

'They’re part of our hometown community and 
we are proud and honored that they choose to live here and share their 
success with us.'

The parade followed several days of partying which got into full swing Monday with their first victory parade through downtown Los Angeles and a rally at the Kings' arena to celebrate their second NHL title in three seasons.

The team estimated 300,000 fans lined Figueroa Street on a perfect L.A. day as the Kings rode nine double-decker buses and a flatbed truck about one mile to Staples Center.

The LA Kings claimed the cup with a 3-2 win against the New York Rangers in double overtime.

Afterwards Alec Martinez, who scored the team's double-overtime goal, said: 'It's been a pretty incredible experience these last few years. It's just as good as the first time. Maybe even better.'
