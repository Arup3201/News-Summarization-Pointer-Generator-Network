A horrified woman only discovered a man who raped her two decades ago had been released when he was arrested for another rape.

A woman who was only 13 years old when she was raped by Essie Billingslea said she was unaware he'd been released

The woman, whose name has not been released to media as she is a victim of sexual assault, was raped by Essie L. Billingslea and two other men at her home in Arlington, Massachusetts, in 1988 when she was only 13 years old.

'Nobody told me anything,' she told the Boston Globe.

The Boston Globe reports Bililngslea has been convicted of two other rapes and was being held at a Massachusetts Treatment Center until a Suffolk jury voted 12 to 2 to release him in March 2013.

Jurors decided Billingslea was no longer 'sexually dangerous.'

The woman only learned days ago that Billingslea has been accused of beating and raping an Arlington woman at knifepoint on Sunday.

He has entered not guilty plea on charges of aggravated rape, kidnapping, home invasion, and assault and battery.

'I thought it was horrible,' said the woman, now in her late 30s. 'But I wasn't surprised.'

She added that she was not aware of the release of the other two men who assaulted her alongside Billingslea.

'I didnâ€™t know they got out until I saw them walking on the street,' she said.

He served nearly two decades for three rapes before being released.

Along with the 1988 assault, his convictions include raping an 11-year-old girl in 1986 and attacking another 11-year-old in 1993, who was a friend of his then-girlfriend's daughter.

He was sentenced to five years in prison over the 1988 assault and raped the third victim only 18 months after being released.

Victims must tell prosecutors at the time of conviction if they wish to be notified of the offender's release.

They must also provide changes of address.

None of Billingslea's victims asked to be notified of his release, according to the Correction Department.

When he was originally convicted in 1989, there was little staff in a still-developing state's victim witness advocacy program and prosecutors were often charged with tracking both witnesses and victims.

When Billingslea was near release in 2013, the state argued he continued to meet the criteria for a sexually dangerous person and should remain committed.

State law defines a sexually dangerous person as anyone convicted of a sex offense also suffering a mental abnormality or personality disorder which would lead them to commit a sex crime. It could also be someone who shows an inability to control sexual impulses after a conviction.

One forensic psychologist who testified in Billingslea's case said he should remain in treatment but the other said he no longer met the state's criteria.

None of his victims testified in his most recent trial.

Jurors are asked not to determine guilt or innocence but how likely is the risk of a new assault.
