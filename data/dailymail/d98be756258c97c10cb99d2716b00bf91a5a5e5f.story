These children are forced to travel to school on boats due to the seasonal overflowing of the river that passes by their village.

The village of Truni in Java, Indonesia, has been repeatedly flooded for more than four months after the Bengawan Solo river overflowed and flooded the whole district.

The river has always burst its banks during the rainy season, but damage to the landscape caused by illegal sand mining in recent years has made flooding more severe than ever.

No use wearing shoes... This year around a thousand houses over 12 villages in Java's Lamongan district have been submerged by water, which is some places has reached a metre deep

In the most recent inundation around a thousand houses over 12 villages in Java's Lamongan district have been submerged by several times by waters that in some places have reached nearly a metre deep.

The flooding started on January 5, the Jakarta Globe reported, with a 25m-long section of embankment in the area collapsing in the heavy rains.

That prompted the subsequent collapse of a further 200m of embankment.

A dry spot: Floods have inundated a number of homes in the village and residents have been forced to carry on life as best they can in the difficult circumstances

The Begawan Solo (Bengawan is simply the Old Javanese word for river) is the longest river in Java, Indonesia's largest island where the country's capital is found.

It flows 375 miles north from its source by the volcano Mount Lawu into the Java Sea, effectively slicing the island in two.

As the floodwaters came, families were forced to flee to higher ground with what few possessions they were able to rescue.

Critics say there is little effort from the Indonesian government to address the flooding of the Bengawan Solo

After the inundation failed to subside, many had nowhere to go and were forced to return, building plinths inside their homes to keep themselves dry at night.

Riverside residents like those from Truni are forced to wash and bathe in water that has been contaminated with faeces and pesticides.

Critics say there is little effort from the Indonesian government to address the flooding of the Bengawan Solo, even though erosion caused by illegal sand-mining machines has made it an annual occurrence.
