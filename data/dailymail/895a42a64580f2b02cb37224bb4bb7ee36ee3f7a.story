Roberto Bautista Agut says he is not scared about taking on Andy Murray.

Murray is likely to face the first real test of his Wimbledon title defence on Friday when he plays 27th seed Bautista Agut in the third round.

The 26-year-old Spaniard is having the best season of his career and won the first ATP Tour title of his career on grass in Holland last week.

Bautista Agut said: 'I'm not scared. I will try to play my game. I am winning a lot of 
matches. I will try to be aggressive and I will try to enjoy playing 
with Andy here on grass.'

Murray and Bautista Agut have never played a match against each other before but they practised together on clay in Valencia in April.

'He's a very good player,' said Murray. 'He doesn't play like a lot of the Spanish guys. He plays very flat. Not much top spin. The grass courts suit his game pretty well. He's obviously started well here. It will be a step up for sure. He's improving all the time.'

Bautista Agut is at a career-high ranking of 23 having climbed 50 places since the start of the year.

The stand-out result of his year came in the second round of the Australian Open, when he upset Juan Martin del Potro.

'It was very good for me to win this match because after this match I thought I could win against every player,' said the Spaniard. 'It gave me a lot of confidence to start the season very well.'
