This is the shocking moment an explorer narrowly escaped death as he tumbled down a mountain with a snowmobile hurtling behind him.

Kris Kenni Stxvlbfx was attempting to become the first person to ride up a steep incline near Simimut in Greenland.

But just yards away from the summit, he crashed into a rock and flew off his snowmobile - sending him plummeting down the mountain on his back.

Shocking: This is the moment Kris Kenni Stxvlbfx narrowly escaped death as he tumbled down a mountain with a snowmobile hurtling behind him. The dramatic incident was captured on a Go Pro camera fixed to his head

Setting off: Mr Stxvlbfx was trying to become the first person to ride up a steep incline near Simimut, Greenland

Attempt: He can be seen attempting to ride the vehicle up the challenging slope while several bystanders watch

Crash: But just yards away from the summit, he crashes into a rock and loses control of the snowmobile

Alarmingly, his out-of-control vehicle also started to hurtle down the slope behind him.

The dramatic incident was captured on a Go Pro camera fixed to Mr Stxvlbfx's head.

Footage shows the explorer steering the snowmobile down the mountain while negotiating his way through surrounding rock formations. 

He then attempts to ride the vehicle up an uneven incline to the left of the slope, while several bystanders watch in anticipation. 

No grip: Mr Stxvlbfx can be seen flying off his snowmobile, before plummeting onto the snow-covered ground

Out-of-control: The explorer then tumbles down the mountain for a full minute, before finally coming to a stop

Horrific: Footage shows him glancing back to find, to his horror, that his snowmobile is also hurtling behind him

However, as Mr Stxvlbfx reaches the summit, he loses his grip on the vehicle - causing him to plummet to the ground.

He can then be seen tumbling down the slope, before glancing back to find, to his horror, that the snowmobile is also hurtling behind him.

Mr Stxvlbfx appears to fly uncontrollably down the steep 
mountain for a full minute, before finally coming to a stop.

Safe again: The out-of-control snowmobile was eventually brought to a halt by one of Mr Stxvlbfx's friends

However, as his snowmobile hurtles toward him, it manages to evade his grip and continues to flip through the snow.

The large vehicle was eventually brought under control by a bystander who came to Mr Stxvlbfx's aid.

Remarkably, the explorer came away from the incident unharmed.
