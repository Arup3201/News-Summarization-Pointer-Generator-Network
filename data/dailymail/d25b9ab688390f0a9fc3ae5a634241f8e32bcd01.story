Smiling: The US-born actress-turned-photographer, famed for appearing naked in the soft porn film Emily, is accused of taking an oil painting from her former partner

Prince Andrew’s former girlfriend Koo Stark had her trial date for stealing a painting set back because she is due to meet the Dalai Lama, it emerged today.

Appearing at Hammersmith Magistrates Court she smiled as she was sent to face trial for allegedly stealing a £40,000 painting from her former partner. 

The hearing was to set a court date for her trial.

Defence barrister Edward Henry requested she not appear until after December 18 because she has a 'longstanding commitment' with the Dalai Lama.

He said 'My client has a long-standing religious engagement that requires her to travel abroad.

'She is due to see an emminent person, the Dalai Lama, after November 26th and will be back on December 16th.

'Its a long-standing religious engagement and I wonder if the court would give some consideration to that commitment?'

The court then set a date of December 18th for a preliminary hearing at Isleworth Crown Court.

Mr Henry asked whether December 21st could be given as he is unavailable on December 18th, but was told the court could not comply with that request.

The US-born actress-turned-photographer, 56, famously appeared naked in the erotic film Emily.

She is accused of taking the oil painting of a moonlit coastal landscape by Dutch master Anthonie Van Borssom from the home of her ex-partner American financier Warren Walker.

Looking younger than her years and glamorous in a beige skirt suit, black top and black strappy sandals, she arrived at Hammersmith Magistrates Court in a white Fiat 500, but was forced to drive off after being refused entry to the car park. 

She then returned on foot and looked happy and relaxed as she entered the building.

It is said she arrived at Mr Walker’s Notting Hill home with a bunch of flowers on July 21 and told the housekeeper she was taking two pictures.

As the housekeeper went to get a vase Miss Stark is said to have taken a picture off the wall and the pair got in a ‘tug-of-war’ over it, it is alleged.

Miss Stark lost when the housekeeper managed to hold on to it but she then ran up the staircase and took another painting before fleeing the property, it is said.

Miss Stark, whose real name is Kathleen, indicated through her solicitor she ‘strenuously denied’ the charge and was given the painting as a gift by her former lover.

Miss Stark will appear at Isleworth Crown Court for a preliminary hearing on 18 December.

The photographer was in a relationship with Mr Walker until he jilted her 10 days before their 1997 wedding when she was seven months pregnant with their daughter Tatiana, now 15.

The pair have had a tempestuous relationship since and she once threatened to sue him for ‘emotional distress’ after he applied for custody of their daughter when she was 11.

She also dated Prince Andrew when he returned from the Falklands conflict in 1981, after they met on a blind date during his leave from the Royal Navy.

He took her on holiday to Mustique, she was invited to Balmoral to meet the Royal Family and there were rumours of an engagement.

But the romance ended when it emerged she had appeared semi-naked in a raunchy film called Emily in 1976.
