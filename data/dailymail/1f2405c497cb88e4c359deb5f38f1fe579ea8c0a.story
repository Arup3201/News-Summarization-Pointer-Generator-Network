I have given in to an overwhelming number of requests to take the ALS Ice Bucket challenge.

Bad timing really given that summer is now officially over and the country has avoided autumn this year and has instead jumped straight to freezing cold winter.

Just for anyone who has been living in a cave for the past month, the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge is charity campaign to raise awareness and money to aid research into Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or as we call it here in the UK, motor neurone disease.

Spencer was nominated by singer/charity campaigner Stacey Jackson, Rick Parfitt Jnr and Jamie Laing

The challenge is very simple, you video 
yourself having a bucket of icy water thrown over your head and then you
 nominate three friends that then have to do the same within 24 hours.

My
 latest nomination was from singer/charity campaigner Stacey Jackson, 
but there have been several others, notably Rick Parfitt Jnr and Jamie 
Laing.

So far the challenge has raised £48m pounds for research into 
the disease which affects the brain and the spinal cord causing motor 
neurons to die and leads to gradual paralysis and eventually death.

There
 is no known cure for this terrible disease and seeing as I am a TV 
personality and not a neurosurgeon, the best thing I thought I could do
 to help was to throw a bucket of icy water over my head.

If you are 
thinking of doing this challenge then please do it properly. Pick a 
container large enough to bathe a small child. There needs to be much 
more than a couple of pints of freezing cold water - please note Simon 
Cowell and Stacey Jackson - perhaps you would both care to do it again?

Bill Gates and David Beckham did much better - both chose very decent sized containers of chilly water.

A barman at Meursault prepared a huge Jeroboam bucket filled with a 50/50 mix of ice and water

When
 I took my challenge I was doing a PR job for EA's latest game Sims 4 
and I was at a very high-end club called Meursault on Gloucester Road.

The
 barman picked out a wine cooler which contained barely over a pint, I 
refused. Then a champagne bucket, still not big enough, then a magnum 
cooler, I pointed towards the rather huge Jeroboam bucket.

The 
bartender added a 50/50 mix of ice and water. I sat out on the pavement 
outside as the club didn't really want two gallons of icy cold water 
poured all over the floor just before their lunch-time service started. 
Then the world's coldest wet T-shirt competition began.

It's not the 
first time I've had a cold drink thrown over me, as viewers of Made In 
Chelsea will know, but this time at least it was for a good cause.

And
 now I have nominated Hugo Taylor, Caggie Dunlop and Lucy Watson to do 
their challenge in 24 hours, so let's see if they can handle it.
