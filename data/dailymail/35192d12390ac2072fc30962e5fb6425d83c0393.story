Photos have emerged of the tragic final moments before an off-duty California Highway Patrol officer - in Las Vegas for his bachelor party - was killed on Sunday after his truck was stolen with him and his brother-in-law stuck in the truck bed before it was crashed into an oncoming car, throwing the two men to their deaths.

The man who allegedly hijacked the vehicle, 29-year-old James Robert Montgomery, of Tustin, California, was staying in another hotel on the Vegas strip with his girlfriend when authorities say he jumped into Magdaleno's truck - which had the keys in the ignition at the time - and drove off.

Montgomery, whose attorney, Michael Becker, describes as a 'lawful person' who works at a Whole Foods grocery store, told police after his arrest that he has no recollection of stealing the truck - he says he remembers walking around the Flamingo Hotel and being in a car crash, but that he can't remember anything in between, according to his arrest report. 

Doomed: Jesus Magdaleno and Feliz Cruz just before Magdaleno's hijacked truck collides with another vehicle

Mourned: Jesus Magdaleno Jr., 33, was an eight-year veteran of the California Highway Patrol. He was set to be married next month and was in Las Vegas for his bachelor party

According to authorities, Magdaleno Jr. was loading
his suitcases into his Ford F-150 with his brother-in-law Felix Cruz to
return home on Sunday, when Montgomery jumped into the running vehicle and 
took off with Cruz still in the bed.

Magdaleno,
33, ran after the pickup, shouted that he was a CHP officer and jumped 
into the cargo bed with his sister's husband, Mr Cruz, while the driver 
sped wildly away from the Flamingo hotel-casino, according to a police 
report.

'They were heading home after an enjoyable time, and they became victims of a horrible crime,' Las Vegas police Lieutenant Ray Steiber said.

'A vehicle is being stolen. His friend is in the bed of the vehicle. He runs to the aid of his friend who is in danger,' Steiber said of Magdaleno. 'He gave his life for someone else.'

A witness on the 17th floor of a nearby casino heard the commotion and told police she saw the white 2009 Ford F150 accelerate away from the Strip, mow down construction cones and speed through red lights on an Interstate 15 overpass.

The woman heard the two men in the back of the truck shouting for help before the pickup collided with a 2001 Ford Escape SUV and slammed into a traffic signal pole about 11 a.m. Sunday in front of the Rio All-Suites Hotel & Casino, about a mile west of the Flamingo.

Magdaleno and Cruz were thrown from the bed of the truck.

Magdaleno, an eight-year CHP veteran from Visalia, was killed. He was due to be married in September.

Montgomery was arrested at the scene and hospitalized after the crash. He was booked into the Clark County jail on felony murder, kidnapping, auto theft, battery and robbery charges pending an initial court appearance. 

Three people in the SUV were treated for minor injuries, police Officer Laura Meltzer said.

Montgomery spoke with a taxi driver before climbing into the driver's seat of Magdaleno's pickup, the arrest report said. Surveillance footage showed Magdaleno chase the vehicle and jump in the bed when it stopped for traffic.

The videos were impounded as evidence and not made public.

Flamingo owner Caesars Entertainment Corp. spokeswoman Debbie Munch issued a statement extending sympathy to the families and friends of the two men. She said the company was cooperating with the police investigation.

Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson
said the charges against Montgomery could make him eligible for the 
death penalty, but a decision about that is weeks away.

Becker said outside 
court on Wednesday that he's not talking anymore about the case against Montgomery until he sees evidence police have collected since the Sunday
morning crash.

"This case, I think there's more to it than meets the surface," Becker said.
