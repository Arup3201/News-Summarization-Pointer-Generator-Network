Holidaymakers face a flight price hike from next month as Air Passenger Duty soars by almost 10 per cent.

The rise will see the tax on a family of four flying to Florida increase to £260 while a trip to Australia will now be hit by £368 in charges.

Flights to Spain will also be hit by £52 levies.

The sharp increase in air passenger duty - dubbed the 'poll tax of the skies' - will come into effect from April 1.

Airlines said George Osborne's tax grab will be a major blow to British tourism in the Olympic year as the levy is also paid on all flights into the country.

The Chancellor was accused of burying bad news because the tax rise was not mentioned in his budget yesterday but appeared in papers released by the Treasury later.

From April next year the owners of private aircraft will also have to pay the charge.

Air passenger duty is banded according to the flight's destination.

Holidaymakers travelling to Europe will pay £13 per ticket from next month, £65 if travelling to the U.S. and £92 for flights to Australia.

While Air Passenger Duty stood at just £5 for a European flight in 2005 and £20 for all other destinations, from next month it will soar.

The tax will now add £92 to the cost of flights to Australia - and £13 for a European destination.

Britain has the highest air passenger duty in the world, and this table outlines how it will hit your flights.

In 2005 the charge was just £5 on all European flights and £20 for all other destinations.

The tax is expected to raise £2.6billion for the Treasury in the current financial year.

The 8 per cent hike coming into effect next month takes into account inflation and a deferred increase from April 2011.

Travel
industry leaders last night joined together to slam the move, claiming 
the Government was 'squeezing the life out of the economy' with its 
'blinkered approach' to aviation tax.

Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary joined 
with his counterparts Carolyn McCall from easyJet, Willie Walsh from 
British Airways owners IAG and Steve Ridgway from Virgin Atlantic to 
criticise the hike.

They 
said: 'In every other leading country, aviation is an expanding industry
that underpins and facilitates growth in other parts of the economy.

'In the UK, rises of up to 360 per 
cent in APD in the last seven years are squeezing the life out of the 
economy. The CAA has confirmed that UK passenger numbers last year were 
the same as in 2004.

'Yet again, the Treasury is pressing ahead with further rises without any analysis of their effect on the wider economy.

'In the absence of such a study, we 
must assume that the Treasury knows it cannot justify this 
job-destroying tax in overall economic terms. APD must be scrapped.'

Mark Tanzer, chief executive of ABTA, the travel association, said the tax hike will stunt growth in tourism.

'The Government has repeatedly said 
it looks to travel and tourism as one of its key drivers of growth but 
instead of listening to concerns that APD is stunting this growth, not 
only in travel but in the wider economy too, it has chosen to 
significantly increase the tax burden,' he said.
