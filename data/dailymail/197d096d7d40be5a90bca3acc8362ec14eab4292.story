One in eight refuse to holiday without grooming gadget

One in five claim they 'can't live without' their hairdryer

TOWIE and Georgie Shores stars named as influences

If you thought the march of the metrosexual was over - think again. The term, coined in the Nineties for the plucked and preened men who had David Beckham as poster boy, is back in business as TV's reality stars promote the effeminate look all over again.

But the more the stars of shows like TOWIE and Geordie Shores wax, coiff, and tan themselves onscreen, the more widespread this grooming obsession becomes off.

In fact, a new study has found that British men are now so vain that one in eight refuses to travel abroad without packing their hair straighteners.

So concerned is the new wave of metrosexuals about their hair that a fifth even say they 'could not live without' a hairdryer when overseas.

The surprising results surfaced when Dixons carried out the study to see which gadgets men typically pack in their luggage.

It found that seven electrical items - worth over £1,000 - was the norm.

But while this includes gadgets such as mobile phones and iPads, the list was topped by the hair straighteners and hair dryers  - and quickly followed by, of all things, travel irons.

In fact, if allowed to travel with just one 
device, four times as many men than women would take an iron, the poll 
of 2,000 holidaymakers reveals.

On average, women actually travel lighter - carrying a mere three electrical items in their suitcase, the study by technology retailer Dixons Travel found.

Daryl Humphries, from Dixons Travel, 
said: 'The traditional image of Brits abroad has changed massively with 
men no longer wearing string vests or knotted hankies.'Instead we have seen the rise in popularity of the Geordie Shore male - all plucked, preened and presented.

'We are increasingly seeing men 
coming into our stores to pick up last minute travel essentials, such as
 a hair dryer and travel iron, before they board the aircraft.

'They often hope their girlfriend won't notice.'
