A year on from the launch of Tesco’s hugely popular Hudl tablet, the retail giant has released its next-generation model.

Unveiled at an event in London, the hudl2 has an 8.3-inch screen - an increase in size from the original 7-inch model – and runs on Android KitKat 4.4.2.

It will be available from Tesco stores, and online, from 9 October for £129.

Clubcard customers can also purchase the hudl2 through Clubcard Boost – a scheme that doubles the value of Clubcard vouchers - meaning the price drops to £65.

The original Hudl launched on 1 September 2013 and more than 35,000 models were sold in the first two days of release.

In total, Tesco claims it has sold more than 750,000 devices in the past 12 months. 

The price of the original Hudl has been dropped from £129 to £99. 

In addition to boosting the screen size, the hudl2 has updated its cameras.

The hudl2 is available in eight colours including, what the company dubbed, Jazzy Blue, Zesty Orange, Slate Black, Rocket Red, Tropical Turquoise, Dreamy White, Perky Purple and Bubblegum Pink (pictured)

The original Hudl has a 3MP rear-facing camera, and 2MP camera on the front, while the hudl2 has a 5MP rear, but has dropped the front-facing device to 1.2MP.

This puts the cameras on the hudl2 in direct competition with those on Google’s Nexus 7 (2013) and Apple’s iPad mini with Retina Display.

The resolution of the hudl2 has been increased to 1920 x 1200, up from 1400 x 900 on the original, but the larger screen on the newer model means the pixel-per-inch (PPI) density is only marginally better; 272 compared to 237.

PPI is an indicator of image sharpness, clarity and colour.

Elsewhere, Tesco claims the hudl2 has an eight-hour battery life - which matches the original model - when watching videos, and 16GB of on-board memory, which can be expanded to 48GB.

And inside, it is powered by an Intel Atom quad-core processor.  

Tesco has also partnered with The Parent Zone to develop a filter on the hudl2 meaning children and parents can use one device safely.

The built-in app makes it easier for parents to set up profiles for up to seven users.

Each of these can be tailored based on age and suitability, including setting a time limit to pre-determine how long a child spends using the tablet.

Michael Comish, group digital officer at Tesco said: ‘We know customers want easy, accessible technology that the whole family can use whether working, shopping, gaming, learning or just taking some time out. Cutting-edge technology doesn’t have to come with a big price tag.

‘hudl2 may be affordable, but we’ve cut no corners when it comes to performance - this is our best tablet offering yet.’

The hudl2 is available in eight colours including, what the company dubbed, Jazzy Blue, Zesty Orange, Slate Black, Rocket Red, Tropical Turquoise, Dreamy White, Perky Purple and Bubblegum Pink.

Each hudl2 additionally comes with £25 free blinkbox credit to spend on movies, books and music, £10 off clothing range F&F when customers spend £50, £10 off Tesco Direct when they spend £50, £15 of Tesco.com when they spend £60 and 10 free  photos when they buy 50 at Tesco Photo.
