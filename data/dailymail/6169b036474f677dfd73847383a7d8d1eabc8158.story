Mothers spend an average of £87 to make sure they look their best at the school gates - with many citing TV host Holly Willoughby as their inspiration

As the summer holidays end, there’s only one group putting maximum effort into looking immaculate for the first day back at school – and it isn’t the children.

Mothers spend an average of £87 to make sure they look their best at the school gates, figures out yesterday reveal.

When many children return to class on Monday, mums will have spent a collective £658million on clothes, jewellery and beauty treatments as one in five of them admits they feel under pressure to look glamorous on the school run.

One in six plans their outfit at least a week in advance, research by discount website VoucherCodes.co.uk shows.

Some 8 per cent also get their hair and nails done and even have their fake tan topped up in order to dazzle at the school gate, spending an average of £25.88 on spa treatments.

And 7 per cent admit they make an effort due to their crush on the teacher – with 4 per cent of single mums seeing the drop-off  as a chance to find love.

Of the 1,000 mums polled, most cited TV host Holly Willoughby as their inspiration for school run style, with singer Myleene Klass in second place.

One in seven will fork out for a completely new ensemble, with more than one in four admitting they spend time on their appearance to avoid embarrassing their child in front of classmates. 

Mothers in London spend the most, splashing out an average £136.10 on looking perfect.

Other school gate models included Elle McPherson, Tess Daly, Jools Oliver and Stella McCartney.

Anita Naik, consumer editor at VoucherCodes.co.uk, said: 'Competitive mums put a lot of effort into making sure their children are seen to have and be the best.

'But our research shows they put the same pressures on themselves - making sure they look trendy to impress their child’s classmates and teachers and the other parents.

'For mums hoping to look good for the school run without blowing a hefty chunk of the family budget it’s worth downloading money-saving apps designed to show you the best deals available while you’re out and about.

'It’s also worth bearing in mind that beauty salons often provide introductory rates, so mums getting their hair or nails done should think about trying a new place and checking whether they can get a deal as a first time customer.'
