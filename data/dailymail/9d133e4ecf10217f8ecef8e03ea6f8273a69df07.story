Seven years ago, he was an overweight smoker who feasted on chocolate and takeaways.

But yesterday, Steve Way finished tenth in the Commonwealth Games marathon, breaking a 35-year-old  British record. And the 40-year-old  celebrated his feat by drinking his first pint of lager for three months.

The bank worker finished in two hours, 15 minutes and 16 seconds, beating Ron Hill’s 1979 best for the over-40s. Mr Way, from Bournemouth, weighed sixteen and a half stone and smoked 20 cigarettes a day when he decided to get fit at the age of 33.

Pleased: Steve Way tweeted shortly after the race describing it as the 'Best day ever'

Going the distance: Steve Way will represent England in the marathon at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow

He soon realised he was beating club 
runners despite being a ‘fat bloke’ and began to train before and after 
work.

Yesterday, he said: ‘I need to go have a drink and I’m not talking
 about water. This is the best day ever. Running is normally second 
place to my wedding day but this one matches it.’

He told BBC Radio 5 Live achieving the 'old man record' was great and matched his wedding day to wife Sarah, in terms of being the best day of his life.

He said: 'Commonwealth Games 10th place, these sort of athletes, mixing it up with the Africans at the front of a Commonwealth Games – I thought it’d be scary but it was so much fun.

'The smile is not going to go away for a while.'

And he advised other people: 'Get off the couch, go and give it a try you never know. Underneath that fat suit of mine there was a marathon runner, you never know and you’ve got to give it a try.'

There
 were also inspirational scenes in the velodrome as Olympics poster girl
 Laura Trott struck gold again despite suffering a kidney infection over
 the weekend. The 22-year-old had eaten nothing but porridge for several
 days after falling ill, but still managed  her first Commonwealth 
medal.

After winning the 
25km points race at Glasgow 2014, she cycled to her parents, who hugged 
her. The Olympic double gold medallist was also supported by boyfriend 
Jason Kenny, 26, who was competing in the velodrome too but failed to 
win a medal.

Miss Trott 
said she initially did not realise she had won and mistakenly 
congratulated second-place Elinor Barker from Wales after crossing the 
finishing line. ‘I actually rolled up alongside Elinor and said “Well 
done, Commonwealth champion,” then it came up [on the screen] and I was 
like, ‘Oh ****, she’s going to think I have said that on purpose.’

After
 she won, Miss Trott held up her red helmet, bearing the Union Flag. It 
is believed to be the same one she wore for London 2012, when she rode 
for Team GB rather than Team England. A Team England spokesman said: ‘As
 with all technical equipment, athletes stick with what they’re used to 
and train and compete in all the time.’
