Behrang Safari, the villain of the piece in Liverpool's Champions League exit, has insisted he did not dive to get Lazar Markovic sent off and claims he was 'bleeding from the mouth' after the incident.

With Liverpool already trailing 1-0 to Basle in a game they needed to win to qualify for the knockout stagea, Serbian winger Markovic was sent off on 61 minutes - just 16 minutes after coming on - after flailing an arm in Safari's direction.

The contact with the Basle defender was minimal at most as Markovic tried to escape his marker's attention, but when asked by Swedish newspaper Sportbladet if he had been caught, Safari insisted: 'Yes, yes of course. I was bleeding from my mouth.'

The 29-year-old Swede added that he did not realise Markovic had been sent off until he was surrounded by angry Liverpool players.

'I wouldn’t have gone to ground if he hadn’t hit me. I am not the kind of player who dives,' Safari said. 'It was a bit strange, I didn’t realise that it was a red card first. 

'I thought the referee had blown his whistle because it was a head injury and I thought I was going to give the ball to the Liverpool players afterwards.

'But then I noticed that the Liverpool players were angry with me.'

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers disagreed with the decision to send off the former Benfica forward.

'I thought the sending off was really disappointing decision by the referee,' he said.

'Lazar Markovic gets sent off for that, his fingernail barely touches the nose of the defender and the defender is the guy who should be looked at for his reaction.'

Liverpool equalised on 82 minutes through a Steven Gerrard free-kick but could not find the winner that would have sent them through to the last 16 in Basle's stead.
