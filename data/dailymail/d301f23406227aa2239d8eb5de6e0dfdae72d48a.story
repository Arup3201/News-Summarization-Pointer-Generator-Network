Chris Jordan turned in another matchwinning performance on Wednesday as England bounced back from Sunday's humiliating defeat with a stunning victory over Sri Lanka.

The 24-year-old took five for 29 to help skittle the tourists for 67, then sat back and watched Alastair Cook and Ian Bell knock off the runs in 73 deliveries at Old Trafford.

The rout came three days after England were dismissed for 99 in Durham and Jordan admitted England were 'hurting' after their worst defeat in a home one-day international.

'It wasn't just that we were beaten but the way we lost,' he said. 'Those days can happen for a team in transition but we wanted to put it right and I'm just glad we were able to do that.'

Top man: Alastair Cook's 33rd win made him England's most successful 50-over skipper

It was Cook's 33rd win as one-day captain, taking him past Michael Vaughan as the most successful England skipper in the 50-over format.

'The lads came out firing today,' said Cook, whose side lead the five-match series 2-1. 'They were desperate to prove a point and we did just that. Sunday was a strange game but we kept our nerve here and hit back.' He was full of praise for Jordan, adding: 'Every time he takes a wicket you can see how much it means to him.'
