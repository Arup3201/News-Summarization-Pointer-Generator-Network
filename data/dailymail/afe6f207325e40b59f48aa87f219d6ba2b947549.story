Dishevelled, overweight and struggling to walk, Freddie Starr yesterday lashed out at police and prosecutors after a sex case against him was finally dropped.

The 71-year-old TV entertainer signalled he will sue for compensation after he was released from bail more than 18 months after his first arrest.

Prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to support the claims of 13 women that he molested them up to 40 years ago.

They
 added that although there was enough material in a 14th case for a 
‘realistic prospect of conviction’ it would not be in the public 
interest to go to court.

Starr,
 whose health has deteriorated so much he has needed a wheelchair during
 the investigation, criticised the authorities after the decision. 
Speaking at his Warwickshire village mansion, his lawyer Dean Dunham 
said: ‘This will not be the end of this matter.

‘I’ll
 tell you this, we will not be sitting down and letting this go as it is
 now. The police have some questions to answer and they will be 
answering them.

‘They do 
need to be accountable – I wouldn’t like to see anyone else go through 
what Freddie has been through. In this case, it wasn’t justified.

‘There
 was simply never ever enough evidence in this matter that was anywhere 
near sufficient to keep a man on bail for 18 months.’

Starr
 was the second celebrity to be arrested by Scotland Yard’s Operation 
Yewtree when he was held on November 1, 2012. He was re-arrested four 
times and re-bailed nine times as the controversial investigation 
engulfed his generation of celebrities.

The
 comedian accused police and prosecutors of ‘playing dirty’ by 
associating him with known paedophiles Jimmy Savile and Gary Glitter.

Starr
 was one of the most high-profile and outspoken Yewtree suspects and the
 decision to release him is a major blow for an inquiry which some have 
branded a ‘witch-hunt’. It comes just days after detectives secured 
their first conviction when publicist Max Clifford was found guilty of a
 string of  sex attacks.

Starr
 suspects the announcement was delayed by the Clifford case, because his
 notorious front page story – ‘Freddie Starr ate my hamster’ – featured 
in the evidence. But prosecutors insist they only made their final 
decision late last week and did not receive a full case file from police
 until March.

Clearly in 
poor health, Starr spoke only to say ‘I feel relieved’ as he faced the 
media yesterday. But his lawyer aimed a strongly-worded volley of 
criticism at the authorities whom he accused of orchestrating a 
‘harrowing’ ordeal.

Mr 
Dunham said: ‘It has taken too long; it has not been done properly. We 
presented evidence right at the start of this matter  that we say was 
conclusive to show  that he was not guilty of these allegations.’

The
 claims against Starr first came to light just weeks after the Savile 
scandal first exploded in October 2012. Starr made a failed attempt to 
secure a High Court injunction to restrict media reporting of the claim 
and hired private investigators to examine it.

The decision leaves only a handful of Yewtree suspects on bail, including Glitter, who was arrested five days before Starr.

Others
 include BBC DJ Paul Gambaccini, and former Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning. 
Comic Jimmy Tarbuck was arrested and spent nearly a year on bail before 
being told he would not face charges, while Jim Davidson was recently 
told he faced no further action.

Former
 BBC producers Wilfred De’Ath and Ted Beston and DJ Mike Osman were also
 arrested and later told they would not be charged. Radio One DJ Dave 
Lee Travis was also cleared of sexual assault, although he now faces a 
new trial on three counts.

GUILTY

Max Clifford: The public relations expert was arrested on December 6, 2012. Following
 a trial, he was found guilty last month of eight counts of indecent 
assault stemming from attacks on teenagers dating back more than 40 
years. He was jailed for eight years last week.

NO FURTHER ACTION

Wilfred De’ath:
The former BBC producer was arrested on November 11, 2012 on suspicion 
of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl, but was released without 
charge after a woman withdrew a complaint against him. The
76-year-old has blasted police for being ‘overzealous’, pursuing 
‘spurious’ claims, and failing ‘lamentably’ to stop Savile’s reign
of terror while he was still alive.

Jim Davidson:
The comedian was arrested on January 2, last year on suspicion of 
sexual offences, but the 60-year-old Big Brother winner was later told 
he would not face further action.

Mike Osman:
The 54-year-old radio DJ was arrested in January last year on 
suspicion of sex offences. But he was told he will not face any charges last
August.

Ted Beston: The former BBC radio producer was arrested on December 19, 2012. In May last year it was announced that the 77-year-old would not face any further action.

Jimmy Tarbuck: The 74-year-old comedian was arrested in April last year over allegations of child sex abuse in the 1970s, but released without charge two months ago

David Smith:
The former driver who worked for the BBC was found dead at his home on 
the first day of his trial in October last year. The 67-year-old was 
arrested in December 2012 and charged in April last year with abusing a 
12-year-old boy in 1984.

ONGOING

Dave Lee Travis: The former Radio 1 star – dubbed the 'Hairy Cornflake' – was acquitted on
 12 of 14 sex assault 
charges made against him. He will be retried over two allegations on 
which a jury failed to agree verdicts. And last month he pleaded not 
guilty to a fresh charge of indecently assaulting a woman.

Gary Glitter:
The former pop star was arrested on October 28, 2012, on sex abuse 
allegations. The 69-year-old convicted paedophile has now been on bail 
for a year and a half.

Rolf Harris:
The 84-year-old Australian entertainer was questioned under caution on 
November 29, 2012 and then arrested on March 28 last year. He has been 
charged with 12 indecent assaults of young girls and four counts of 
making indecent images of children. Jury selection in his trial is 
expected to begin today, and the prosecution case to open later in the 
week.

Paul Gambaccini:
The radio presenter was arrested on October 29 last year on suspicion 
of sexual offences. He has been bailed by police, and denies the allegations.

Chris Denning:
The Radio 1 DJ was first arrested on Monday, June 3. He has since been 
re-arrested twice over alleged sexual offences. He has been
bailed, and denies the allegations.

INVESTIGATIONS BY OTHER UK FORCES

CLEARED

Michael Le Vell: The Coronation Street actor was cleared last September of various child sex abuse charges, including rape. He had denied 12 charges in total at Manchester Crown Court

William Roache: The Coronation Street actor was cleared in February of sex charges 
dating back to the 1960s. The 81-year-old always maintained his 
innocence and blamed hysteria after the Jimmy Savile scandal for 
'money-grabbing' women who falsely accused him of sex offences.

Nigel Evans: The former deputy speaker, a Conservative first elected to Parliament in 1992, was cleared of rape and sexual assault last month following a trial. A jury at Preston Crown

Court cleared him of nine counts of rape, sexual assault and indecent assault.

ONGOING

Stuart Hall: The veteran broadcaster today pleaded guilty at Preston Crown Court to one charge of indecent assault on a girl under 16 but will face a trial for multiple rapes involving two

alleged victims.

Ray Teret: The
former chauffeur of DJ Jimmy Savile was arrested on November 8, 2012 by 
Greater Manchester Police on historic sex allegations. He was charged 
with a total of 32 offences spanning several decades, including rape, 
indecent assault and gross indecency involving 14 children and a 
17-year-old girl. He is currently awaiting trial.
