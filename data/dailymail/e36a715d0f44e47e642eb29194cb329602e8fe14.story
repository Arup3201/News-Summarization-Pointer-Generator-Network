Many of us have been on cheap package holidays where old noisy buses are used to ferry tourists around, but nobody ever expects a steering wheel to come off in a driver's hands in the middle of his route.

However, that is precisely what happened in Malta recently and a video, which was captured by an unfortunate passenger on the bus, has now appeared online.

The bus had just navigated a corner when the dangerous incident occurred.  

The driver can be seen struggling to handle the wobbly wheel which becomes more unstable as the journey progresses.

The wheel eventually comes off in the bus driver's hands and he reacts  to the incident by subsequently lifting the steering wheel up to show a passing bus driver.

Tourist Hannah Billen filmed the footage and she was very unhappy after the incident.

She wrote online: 'Luckily the bus had just finished driving round a corner before it came off. The driver then waved it to a fellow bus driver before telling the passengers to get off and wait for another bus, leaving us stranded in the middle of nowhere!'

Local reports claim that Malta Public Transport have suspended the driver for unsafe conduct.

Normal journey: Everything seems normal on the bus during the first few seconds of the video 

First sign of trouble: After six seconds the wheel wobbles worryingly for the first time

Carry on: The bus driver seems unperturbed by the wobbly steering wheel and continues driving

Bumpy ride: The bus driver struggles to control the wheel and the bus during the dangerous drive

Bus stop: The steering wheel comes off completely and the bus driver lifts it up to show his fellow driver
