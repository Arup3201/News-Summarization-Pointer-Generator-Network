Tell All: Katherine Losse was a grad school refugee when she joined Facebook as employee #51 in 2005

Facebook has developed an experimental feature called ‘Dark Profiles’ which would give secret accounts to people who did not even sign up, a new book claims.

Engineers wanted to create shadow pages for those who were tagged in photos by their friends in the hope they would cave in and join the social networking website,  Katherine Losse, the author of The Boy Kings: A Journey into the Heart of the Social Network, says.

Nobody at Facebook ‘even flinched’ when staff raised this disturbing new twist as they were so blinded by their mission to take over the world.

The book also claims that in 2007 Facebook technicians worked on programme called ‘Judgebox’ which would let users compare and rate women in echoes of founder Mark Zuckerberg’s sexist ‘Facemash’ app he developed at Harvard.

It confirms for the first time that Facebook staff have a programme called ‘Facebook Stalker’ which lets them track who has been visiting their profiles

And in the early days of the social networking website, employees were given the ‘master’ password with no security checks at all - and allowed to do as they pleased.

The claims are in a new book by Katherine Losse who worked for Facebook between 2005 and 2010 and worked her way up from customer relations to be the speechwriter for its founder Mark Zuckerberg.

She claims that in Autumn 2006 everyone at the company was ‘so convinced that Facebook was something that everyone should have that when the product team created an experimental feature called dark profiles in 2006, nobody even flinched’.

People can be tagged in Facebook photos even if they do not have a profile, and the idea was to create a ‘dark’ version which could apparently be activated if they finally signed up.

Losse writes: 'It reminds me now of the way members of the Mormon church convert dead people, following the logic that if they had know about Mormonism when they were alive they would have been believers’.

One of Zuckerberg’s colleagues later told her: ‘You see, Mark always had this idea for a kind of Wikipedia for people, or what he called a "dark Facebook", where each person would have a wall and people could write anything about them on it.

‘That was actually what he was going to make first at Harvard. But he realised that people wouldn’t use something that didn’t allow them to erase the bad things people said about them, so he made Facebook instead’. Thus the product they built was a kind of compromise.’

Losse, who has an English masters from Johns Hopkins University, claims that as recently as 2007 Facebook engineers were working on ‘Judgebox’ despite being obviously sexist.

The plan was to put two women’s Facebook profile pictures side by side with space for a viewer to put a score for each.

The tagline was ‘Judgebox.com: never judge a (face) book by her cover’ and engineers registered the websites Judgebox.com and Prettyorwitty.com, though they never made it into the full version.

Zuckerberg had already developed such a programme at Harvard and called it Facemash  - but this could potentially be for all of Facebook’s 25 million users at the time.

Losse, who is originally from Phoenix, Arizona, writes: ‘It was moments like these that I realised it was the great and twisted genius of Facebook for anyone who was interested in rating things constantly, as Mark and the engineers who made these types of applications seemed to love doing.

'Mark always had this idea for a
 kind of Wikipedia for people, or what he called a "dark Facebook", 
where each person would have a wall and people could write anything 
about them on it.'

‘Facebook made it possible for men to have endless photographs of women available for judging, and women simply by being on Facebook became fodder for the judging like so many swimsuit models in a Miss America pageant.’

Rumours have long circulated of a feature which allows you to see who exactly has visited your profile, and in her book Losse confirms that it does - but only for Facebook staff.

She said that to her surprise 
‘Facebook Stalker’ as they called it showed that her female friends 
spend longer on her profile than her male friends.

Losse
 also reveals her shock at being given the password to the ‘master’ 
Facebook account called ‘The Creator’ which they could use to check 
through any person’s profile they wanted.

In her customer service role, she would use this to resolve problems users were having and deal with genuine complaints.

But she writes: ‘I experienced a brief moment of stunned disbelief: they just handed over the password with no background check to make sure I am not a crazed stalker’

The claims come at a difficult time for Facebook - it recently sparked yet another backlash after being caught out trying to force its 900 million users to adopt its own email service.

It was accused of ‘hijacking’ users’ contact details and deleting their personal email addresses without asking them first.

In its place is an @facebook.com one instead - even if they never use it.

Facebook also still reeling from its bungled IPO which wiped a third off of its value and sparked a $3billion lawsuit from investors.

The claims in the book will raise fresh questions about a ruling by Ireland’s Data Protection Commission last year that Facebook was not collecting profiles for non-users.

The Internet regulator had claimed in a complaint that Facebook was harvesting data from people without an account such as names, phone numbers and email addresses.

But in a ruling commissioner Billy Hawkes said that they could find no evidence that use was made of such information.

Its decision does not exclude the possibility that back in 2006 - or even sooner - ‘Dark Profiles’ were being actively pursued by Facebook because the commission’s investigation took place last year.

Facebook declined to comment.
