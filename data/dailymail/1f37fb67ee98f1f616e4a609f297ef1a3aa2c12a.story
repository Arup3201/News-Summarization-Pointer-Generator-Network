For someone stuck in the middle of an uncharacteristic goal drought, Kris Boyd’s thirst for hitting the net remains as typically unquenchable as ever.

Since returning to Rangers for a second spell, the highest scorer in the modern history of the Scottish top flight could not have foreseen in his worst nightmares that he would approach October without a single strike in the league to his name.

The 31-year-old is not only without a goal in his last five games, but has drawn a blank in nine of his 11 outings this season for the Ibrox side. The only times he has found the net have been against modest lower-league opponents, notching three against Clyde in the Petrofac Cup and two in the League Cup against Queens Park.

The Scotland striker has found goals hard to come by in the league 

Boyd, to his credit, takes questions on his lack of goals straight on the chin. Where there might once have been a scowl and a stare at his media inquisitors, there is now an honest admission that he need to find the net soon or face losing his place to those of his squad mates who are producing the goods.

‘I base myself on goals and I know I have to start scoring goals if I am going to keep myself in the team,’ he conceded.

‘I might be doing other things in my game better than I did in the past, but I need to start scoring goals.

‘I am not going to hide away from the fact I have missed chances. Some of the chances I have missed have not been like me. But I won’t hide on the pitch. There is no greater feeling than scoring goals for this club and I want to get back to doing that.’

Perhaps in the past Boyd might have pleaded with his team-mates to play more to his strengths to enable him to get on the scoresheet.

But he said: ‘As a team I feel we are creating chances. They might not be for me, but we are scoring two, three, four goals in games and the most important thing is the team winning.

‘There’s competition for places. Nicky Clark came into the team and did well, Jon Daly is back from injury now and Dean Shiels came in against Falkirk on Tuesday and scored.

‘But I do feel it will change for me. We have got players in the team who are capable of creating chances for me and it will surely turn pretty soon.’

It should be pointed out that this is not Boyd’s longest dry spell in Scottish football. That came in 2010 when he went seven games in a row without hitting the back the net as he searched for his 100th SPL goal for Rangers.

He later went 10 games in a row without finding the net for Middlesbrough in the English Championship.

Some strikers might turn to bizarre superstitious routines to help them break the cycle when in the middle of a goal drought, but the former Kilmarnock and Portland Timbers forward insists he isn’t one of them.

‘There were no superstitions when I was scoring so I will just train and prepare the way I always do,’ said Boyd during his promotional duties for Monday night’s game at home to Hibs, live on BT Sport 1.

‘I have been through stages like this in my career before. But those are the standards that I’ve set. I was scoring more or less every game first time round at Rangers and I need to get back to doing that.

‘What you do in these situations is you keep getting into positions to miss or score chances. I have set the standard with the way I have finished over the last nine or 10 years and I feel I should have scored some of my chances recently.

‘But I would be more worried if I wasn’t getting chances. In the Raith game, I missed a few, but I have fed off scraps in the others.

‘I will just keep plugging away and getting myself into positions to get back on the goal trail. I know it won’t be far round the corner. It is a matter of time. As long as you keep working hard and getting into positions, it will change pretty soon.

‘I hope it will be on Monday night because we have a massive game against Hibs at Ibrox.

‘I feel they will be in the race for the title by the end of the season. It might have been a bit of a difficult start for them, but they are a good team and they can cause us problems.

‘It’s a challenge for this club to show that it should be back at the top. I hope it is just a matter of time until we get there.’
