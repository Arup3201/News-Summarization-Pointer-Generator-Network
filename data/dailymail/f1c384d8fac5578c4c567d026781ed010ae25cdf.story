Vigorous gym sessions do wonders for our body, so why don't we think about exercising our face?

Beauty writer Inge Theron has spent years travelling the world unearthing global beauty secrets for her Spa Junkie column. Today she has combined her beauty knowledge with her love of fitness to create the world's first face gym, a non-invasive finger-led facelift that recreates a typical gym workout with a warm-up, interval training and cool down stage.

Speaking to MailOnline about the 
concept, which has just launched in Selfridges as part of its Beauty 
Project and been hailed a key beauty trend for 2014, Inge explained that
 she has suffered several distressing treatments over the years so 
wanted to go back to basics and swap injections for good old-fashioned 
face massage.

Workout for your face: A new concept called Face Gym has launched in Selfridges and mimics a gym class to tone your face and beat wrinkles

She said: 'Face Gym is grounded in the principal that we don’t think twice about toning our muscles at the gym so why think differently about the face?

'Facial muscles are crucial to the way we look and with regular stimulation can lift, tone and tighten the skin, boost blood circulation and collagen production giving a fresh youthful appearance to the skin.

Beauty buff: Inge Theron worked as the Financial Times' undercover Spa Junkie for four years and has now unveiled the world's first face gym, which she promises is the ultimate non-invasive, finger facelift

'There are over 650 muscles in the human body with roughly 50 concentrated in the face, it takes approximately 43 to frown, 17 to smile, but without proper stimulation, face muscles are prone to sagging.

'Face Gym 
goes beyond the skin - our face trainers work deep into the muscles 
around key problem areas such as jowls, eyes and foreheads.'

The
 signature £35 30 minute treatment consists of a warm up, cardio, 
and cool down with £15 (10 minute) add-ons available o target specific 
treatment areas.

Inge
 uses techniques she learnt from her sessions at celebrity favourite 
Barry's Bootcamp and the Skinny B***h Collective, which focus on 
interval training to make your muscles lengthen.

Inge and her team use facial flicking, pummeling and fast finger movements to lift the cheeks, drain excess fluid from under the eyes and work on fine lines.

She refuses to call it a
 'facial', maintaining that it is more about 'sets, reps and packs'.

The session promises to deliver results immediately, but Inge recommends 
going once a week for very visible results.

If you're looking to take 
the workout to the next level, Inge and her team offer 'mouth work', a
 20 minute in-mouth massage, which promises to relieve tension and widen
 the mouth palette.

While
 Inge is the first person to bring this concept to the beauty market, 
face massage has been practiced in ancient cultures for centuries and 
was once the secret of Chinese Empresses practiced 3,000 years ago to 
increase circulation of blood and 'chi' to the face.

Inge does, however, promise that Face Gym is a 'unique, modern interpretation of an ancient practice'.
