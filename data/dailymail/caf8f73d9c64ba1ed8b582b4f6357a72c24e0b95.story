Dowsed in foam, dodging eggs and swigging from bottles of champagne… this is the best of young  British academia.

Final year students at Oxford University poured out of an exam hall at midday yesterday to celebrate with friends.

And following an annual tradition known as ‘trashing’, they were sprayed with foam and flour as bottles of wine and champagne were cracked open.

One isn't enough: A foam-covered student drinks from two bottles

Getting trashed: Final year students sprayed one another with foam confetti and flour after their exams

Floreat: The students were in high spirits after the last exams of their degrees, covering one another with flour and alcohol

Elation: One happy student, still in academic dress, frolics through the streets of the ancient university city

But just as the party kicked off, Westminster was unveiling plans to reign in the university drinking culture.

The Home Office has told students not to go on pub crawls or take part in Twitter and Facebook drinking games and is spending £90,000 trying to combat the problem of excessive drinking.

In future, student union bars – notorious for selling cheap alcohol – will be asked to compete for accredited safe drinking status and encourage a ‘café culture’.

To pass, they must show they are taking action to deter binge-drinking, which will include telling young people not to participate in ‘alcohol-related initiation ceremonies’, social media games or pub crawls organised by private firms.

There has been huge controversy over ‘Carnage UK’ events held in university towns which encourage students to go on pub crawls, often during Fresher weeks.

Alarm has also been raised over the drinking game Neknominate, which involves people filming themselves downing alcohol. The trend, fuelled by videos shared on Facebook and Twitter, has been linked to several deaths.

Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker said he wants to make universities ‘more productive places to study and live’. He said that being accredited safe drinking status should become a ‘badge of honour’.

He added that some students are ‘encouraged to participate in alcohol-fuelled activities which can damage health and in some cases spill over into disorder and anti-social behaviour’.

Student union bars must ensure soft 
drinks are available at the same price or lower and refuse to serve 
‘intoxicated customers’. Universities must also develop ‘a café culture 
that runs into the evening, providing a social alternative to alcoholic 
spaces’.

Warned: Student celebrations in Oxford were branded a 'disgrace' by university proctors last year

After final year exams in Oxford last year, the celebrations were described by university proctors as ‘a disgrace’ because students left behind rotten food, vomit and broken glass.

National Union of Students vice-president Colum McGuire said cutting down on misuse of alcohol could help both student welfare and community relations.

So far the universities that have joined the scheme are Loughborough, Nottingham, Manchester Met, Liverpool John Moores, Swansea, Brighton and Royal Holloway.
