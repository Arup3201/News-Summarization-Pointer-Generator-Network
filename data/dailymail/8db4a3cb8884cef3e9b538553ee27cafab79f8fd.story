Gareth Barry was just 18 when he first played at Old Trafford in 1999. Manchester United had won the Treble five months earlier and his Aston Villa side never had a chance. Sure enough, United won 3-0 with goals from a trio of all-time club greats Paul Scholes, Andy Cole and Roy Keane.

But visits to the so-called Theatre of Dreams no longer cause fear and dread in the away dressing-room.

Indeed, when Barry arrives with Everton on Sunday, he will be chasing his fourth win in three years at Old Trafford, after triumphing twice with Manchester City (6-1 and 2-1) and last season with Everton (1-0), their first in 21 years.

Despite a £150million spending spree in the summer, United do not have the same aura about them as the old days, says Barry.

Asked if the fear factor has gone, the 53-cap ex-England midfielder pulls no punches.

‘It took me 12 years to win a Premier League game there but now I have won the last three times. That is just my experience but it sort of shows you that maybe it’s not what it once was,’ he said.

‘Our manager (Roberto Martinez) has drummed into the players that we are good enough and this club is big enough to be going to places like Old Trafford and get results.’

While United can boast world stars Robin van Persie, Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao, an injury and suspension crisis at the back may require Paddy McNair to continue at centre-half.

Even so, it is also Barry’s job as one of his team’s most experienced players to caution team-mates that even without suspended captain Wayne Rooney, United are still dangerous.

‘We need to show them the respect they deserve. They have got loads of talent, and if they put it together on the day they can probably beat anybody so it’s down to us to produce a good performance.

‘I am sure it was a new experience for the players here last season to win away to United. It was fantastic to win there last season and a significant result.

‘Everton hadn’t won there for many years and there was a great feeling in the dressing room afterwards to break that duck and put in a great performance.

‘That was a big focal point last season for the confidence of the club, to come away from there with three points. And I am sure we will be trying to do it again.’

Martinez has his expectations high. ‘We don’t want to be going to places looking at damage limitation or merely hoping for a result,’ he said.
