Britain’s chaotic immigration system has seen a dramatic rise in the asylum backlog as officials struggle to get a grip on controls at our borders.

The pile of 'pending' applications waiting to be dealt with has soared by almost a quarter in a year, with the most dramatic rises since Home Secretary Theresa May shut the discredited UK Border Agency.

There are fears that attempts to clear the logjam will lead to terrorists and dangerous offenders being allowed to stay in the UK after appeal to reduce the burden of more paperwork.

The number of pending cases awaiting an initial decision hit 22,207, up 23 per cent in a year and the highest level since the coalition was formed in May 2010

The government faces fierce criticism 
for both failing to remove people who pose a threat to Britain and not 
resolving the cases of those who qualify for refuge from oppressive and 
dangerous regimes overseas.

Latest
 figures show that in October there were 22,207 pending asylum cases, up
 23 per cent in a year and the highest level since the coalition was 
formed in May 2010.

In the months after David Cameron took power the number of pending asylum 
applications gradually fell, reaching a low of 14,188 in May 2011.

But since then the number awaiting an initial decision has soared dramatically by more than 50 per cent.

The
 sharpest increase came after Home Secretary Theresa May moved to shut 
the UK Border Agency after repeated criticism for its failure to get a 
grip on the crisis.

Asylum cases are now the responsibility of UK Visas and Immigration within the Home Office.

From September to October the number rose by 7 per cent in a single month - 1,398 cases.

The
 Home Office blamed the rise in cases pending in part on a 14 per cent increase in the 
number of asylum applications it dealt with in 2013 compared to a year 
earlier.

But some 
immigration lawyers accused the Home Office of withdrawing growing 
numbers of cases if they think they will lose appeals, creating further 
delays.

In March Home Secretary Theresa May moved to break up the UK Border Agency after five years of catastrophic failure

Labour’s shadow immigration minister 
David Hanson said: ‘These figures reveal the scale of the incompetence 
and backlogs under this Government despite Theresa May’s promise to get a
 grip. 

‘It’s now urgent that the Home Secretary actually takes real action to solve this backlog.

‘It’s
 unacceptable that people are remaining indefinitely in the country 
because the Home Secretary’s department can’t make decisions and each 
month is simply adding cases to the backlog when people apply for 
asylum.’

As more cases arrive each month, the numbers which have not been dealt with for six months has also risen sharply.

From
 a low of 2,848 six-month old cases in October 2011, the number of 
long-delayed applications has rocketed by 175 per cent to 7,846.

One
 immigration lawyer told MailOnline that Home Office Presenting Officers
 dealing with asylum cases are now judged on their success rates, so if 
they think they will lose a case it will often be withdrawn.

'When
 these withdrawn decisions are sent back to case owners, it is not 
unusual for them to get caught up in the backlog of delayed decisions,' 
the lawyer said.

'There are often further significant delays before we receive a 'final' decision.

'This,
 in association with the increasing delay in initial asylum decisions, 
has caused further misery for many of those who fear persecution in 
their countries of origin.'

The number of cases not dealt with within six months has also risen sharply to almost 8,000 having fallen below 3,000 in 2011

Last year the home affairs select committee warned that some people have been waiting for up to 16 years for a decision on their asylum application.

It also raised fears about rushed decisions to grant asylum to people ‘who later emerge to be involved with terrorist activity’.

Mr Hanson added: ‘We need a robust but fair immigration system where decisions are made quickly and people who are rejected are made to leave the country, whilst ensuring that those who genuinely need asylum can get it.

‘After nearly four years in Government, Theresa May’s immigration policies are in shambles.  We need action now to sort out this mess.’

Labour's shadow immigration minister David Hanson said Home Secretary Theresa May had to get a grip

In March Mrs May killed off the UK Border Agency after five years of catastrophic failure.

The
 agency behind a string of disastrous immigration scandals was cut in 
two and brought into the Home Office under ministers’ control.

Mrs
 May admitted the agency, set up under Labour, had been ‘troubled’ and 
condemned its ‘closed, secretive and defensive culture’.

She also said fixing the system and clearing the huge backlog of cases would take ‘many years’.

A Home Office spokesman said: 'The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need it. We are committed to completing applications as quickly as possible, but asylum cases are often complex and require full and thorough consideration.

'Asylum applications in the year to September 2013 were up 14 per cent on 2012 and this increase in applications has impacted on casework time.

'Despite this, in 2012-13, 78 per cent of initial decisions were taken within six months, and 54 per cent within 30 days.'
