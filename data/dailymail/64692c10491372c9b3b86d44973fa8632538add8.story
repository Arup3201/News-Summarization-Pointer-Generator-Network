With sales of famous fragrances totting up to an astonishing £80bn worldwide, it's no surprise that every celebrity worth their stardust boasts at least one.

And with 20 new star perfumes launching each and every year, there's no shortage of choice. But while some arrive to a round of applause, others have proved to be little more than a nasty whiff.

So which of this year's crop are eau-so-good and worth splashing out on? Femail's fragrance testers are here to reveal which star scents are worth splashing out on - and which deserve a one-way ticket to the bin.

BEST FOR FRIENDS (THAT YOU DON'T REALLY LIKE): KIM KARDASHIAN 'PURE HONEY'

Best for friends: Kim Kardashian's Pure Honey is sickly sweet and is definitely not for minimal types

THE CLAIM: 'An alluring blend of raw wild honey and voluptuous florals, Pure Honey harnesses the legendary aphrodisiac power of honey to bring you Kim Kardashian's most sensual fragrance yet.'

NOTES: Rose, honey, coconut

WE SAY: There's little we don't know about the Kardashians, and like Kim herself, what Pure Honey lacks in mystery, it makes up in sheer, unadulterated front.

A blast of sickly sweet honeyed flowers emerges the second the top comes off the bottle, with an overpowering rose note front and centre. It's definitely not one for those who like their perfumes minimal but Kim's OTT effort is great for anyone who wants their perfume to deliver a powerfully scented punch.

Once it's on, it's virtually impossible to get off and maintains its intensity for hours. Kim's latest EDT truly is the limpet of perfumes and can survive several well-soaped showers. Be warned.

BEST FOR SECRET SANTAS: KATY PERRY 'KILLER QUEEN'

She kissed a girl: But don't go overboard with the squirts with this perfume if you ever want to be kissed yourself

THE CLAIM: 'A charmingly playful yet lethally gorgeous Floriental fragrance, opens with tempting dark berries and lush plum that blend into an opulent floral heart.'

NOTES: Bergamot, orange flower and sandalwood

WE SAY: Boasting
 quite the fruity past herself, a scent sold by the former Mrs Russell 
Brand was always bound to be bound up in apples, plums, berries and the 
occasional whiff of tangerine.

A playfully youthful fragrance, brave is the woman over 25 who steps out doused in this. Understated elegance and grace is not something the perfume - nor Perry herself - do particularly well.

In other news, the bottle's base is a point, which means it can't stand up and flops onto its side and looks drunk - which you'll be if you inhale too much of this high-intensity stuff.

BEST FOR THE (EX) BOYFRIEND: DAVID BECKHAM 'CLASSIC'

Eau de Becks: Despite a dodgy gin and tonic accord, Classic lives up to most of its claims

THE CLAIM: 'Capturing the unique spirit of David’s iconic style, which blends traditional tailoring with modern flair, this woody citrus spicy scent is the perfect expression of contemporary elegance.'

NOTES: Cypress Orpur, Gin Tonic Accord, Vevetier

WE SAY: It's certainly woody, definitely spicy and surprisingly sophisticated, although it does owe a hat tip to the very classic Old Spice.

Bum notes include the Gin Tonic Accord which barely registers and the massive dose of nutmeg which lends it a slightly metallic edge.

Dodgy accords aside, eau de Beckham lives up to the majority of its claims and is definitely one to slip into his stocking.

BEST FOR HORMONAL NIECES: ONE DIRECTION 'OUR MOMENT'

Teen dream: One Direction's Our Moment is likely to prove popular with teenage fans and Simon Cowell

THE CLAIM: 'The sparkling, juicy and feminine fragrance is made up of splashes of fresh fruit and seasonal flowers infused with undertones of warm musk.'

NOTES: Pink grapefruit, jasmine, patchouli

WE SAY: It's certainly fruity but there's very little that's fresh about the British boyband's debut fragrance. Our Moment is an olfactory sugar rush that clings to skin and clothes like a limpet and boasts all the sophistication of a One Direction concert - in short, not much.

That said, eau de One Direction isn't really aimed at adults although grown-up wallets are certainly at the top of the hit list. Currently outselling all other celebrity fragrances by a staggering five to one, it's proof that appealing to teenage hearts and parental bank accounts works like a charm.

Simon Cowell, you'd imagine, will be having a very happy Christmas indeed.

GET IT: One Direction 'Our Moment', from £17, boots.com

BEST FOR CELEBRITY PERFUME HATERS: RIHANNA 'ROGUE'

Subtle: The least offensive of the lot, Rihanna's perfume is blessedly subtle

THE CLAIM: 'Rihanna made it for all women, for every mood, because we all want to project our true selves. Show your strength and beauty and go Rogue.'

NOTES: Cyclamen, plum, amber, patchouli

WE SAY: Soapy, light, breezy, quite summery: Rihanna's concoction is not entirely without merit.

It's far less knock-you-sideways than many other celebrity scents on the market, and is probably the one that would least cause strangers sitting next to you on the train to move seats over.

Undeniably fruity, flowery, youthful and tooth-achingly sweet, it doesn't cling to the skin as much as lesser fragrances do, so once it begins to make you nauseous you can probably babywipe it off pretty swiftly.

GET IT: Rogue by Rihanna, £43, selfridges.com

ONE THAT'S ACTUALLY QUITE NICE: BRITNEY SPEARS 'MIDNIGHT FANTASY'

She sure is Impulsive: Britney's cloying scent will have you remember sleepovers aged 11

THE CLAIM: 'The story of Fantasy Britney Spears unfolds with lush red lychee, golden quince and exotic kiwi.'

NOTES: Quince, jasmine, iris

WE SAY: Ah, being a preteen. Those were the days. Popcorn-fuelled sleepovers, painting your toenails and clogging your parents ventilation system with the cloying scent of nine different cans of Impulse body spray.

Sadly, thanks to Britney Spears and her riotously pungent Fantasy, those days are back.

Run for the hills.

GET IT: Britney Spears Midnight Fantasy, £25, superdrug.com

GUILTY PLEASURE: MADE IN CHELSEA FOR WOMEN

Surprisingly sophisticated: The contents of this green bottle could get you your very own Spencer Matthews

THE CLAIM: 'Made in Chelsea is a Luxury blend of soft florals and juicy fruits with a woody dry down.'

NOTES: Orange, mint, lily of the valley, frankincense

WE SAY: The cheap-looking mint green bottle isn't very classy but surprisingly, what's inside isn't as bad as you might expect.

Kicking off on a fruity note, toned down by a liberal dose of mint, it dries down into a wearable, if ordinary, musky wood.

If you're heading down to Bodo's Schloss and fancy finding yourself a Made in Chelsea boy (Spencer anyone?) then this could be just the ticket.

GET IT: Made in Chelsea For Women, £17.99, thefragranceshop.co.uk

BEST FOR THE BIN: TOWIE 'LOVE ADDICT'

The rotten egg: TOWIE scent smells remarkably (and unpleasantly) like ashtrays and pickled eggs

THE CLAIM: 'This fragrance has a woody oriental accord opening with notes of lemon anise and raisin on a floral heart to keep the passion alive!'

NOTES: Lemon anise, raisin, white flowers

WE SAY: It may be that smelling all the scents has gone to our heads, making us somewhat giddy, but Femail would put money on the TOWIE scent smelling like ashtrays and pickled eggs.

So we tried giving the perfume to a fresh pair of nostrils.

Nope, not giddy. Avoid.
