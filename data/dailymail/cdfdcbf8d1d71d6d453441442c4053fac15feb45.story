Fernando Torres' supreme fitness helped him break all previous records when undergoing his AC MIlan medical, boss Filippo Inzaghi has revealed.

Torres ended a disappointing four years at Chelsea after his £50million switch from Liverpool, when he completed a two-year loan deal with the Rossoneri.

And Inzaghi has revealed the Spanish striker has made an instant impact at the club before he has even kicked a ball.

Inzaghi said after their 3-1 win over Lazio: 'He (Torres) will give us a big hand and the opportunity to make the most of counter-attacks.

'He had his medical tests today and set a new record for the team.

He added: 'What are our objectives? There are perhaps three teams who have something more, but with hunger, temperament and our fans back at San Siro, we could be a surprise.'

Torres' erstwhile Chelsea team-mate Marco van Ginkel will join him in Milan after completing his own loan deal.

The young Holland midfielder, 21, had told the Italians he wanted to stay at Stamford Bridge and fight for his place.

But with his chances looking limited he has decided Milan would be the next best step for his career.
