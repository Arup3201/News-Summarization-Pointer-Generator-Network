Her boyfriend’s dreary taste in furnishings is said to be the spark that first set Chrissie Rucker off in pursuit of all things white.

Faced with the fusty brown and burgundy upholstery in his flat in Fulham, West London, she rushed to the shops to find replacements in more neutral tones, but struggled when it came to buying good quality bed linen in the purest of whites.

She didn’t know it at the time, of course, but that day in 1993 marked the moment Rucker began to dream of setting up a shop selling everything in white.

More than two decades on, the 46-year-old founder of The White Company is one of the UK’s wealthiest businesswomen having transformed what began as a 12-page mail-order catalogue selling white towels and bed linen into a home furnishings and fashion empire.

Her business sells everything from £20 scented candles to £200 cashmere jumpers, and while she has branched out to shades such as ‘biscuit marl’ and ‘cloud grey’, Rucker remains obsessed with all things pale.

Her white revolution has seen sales soaring at her 53 High Street stores — even the Queen has sent out her ladies-in-waiting to buy bedspreads — and has spread across the Atlantic where she launched a U.S. website last year.

Latest figures show that the mother-of-four’s company made pre-tax profits of £6.5 million last year — an increase of 38 per cent. Her position on the Sunday Times Rich list has climbed steeply from 427th to 326th. She and her husband’s combined wealth is estimated at £295 million.

Aside from the money pouring into company coffers, Rucker owns three stunning properties, all decorated from roof to floor in her trademark sweeping white interiors.

There’s a £12.5 million 17th-century manor house in Buckinghamshire, set in 51 acres of parkland, a £4 million townhouse in London’s fashionable Holland Park and what is widely regarded to be the finest property in the Swiss Alps, Haus Alpina, a luxury chalet with full-time staff which Rucker rents out for a staggering £26,000 a week.

Even at Rucker’s main residence, the country mansion, the only flashes of colour you’ll see are the bright pony rosettes awarded to her horse-mad daughters.

All in all, it’s a rather surprising state of affairs for a woman who disappointed her parents by leaving school at 16 with six O-levels and signing up at the Lucie Clayton finishing school which promised to prepare girls for marriage, society and ‘the season’.

However, it was not long before Rucker decided she wanted to do something more interesting with her life than flutter her eyelashes at eligible young bachelors on the London social circuit.

Indeed, the statuesque blonde’s path to fortune is rather more colourful than her dazzling white shops might suggest.

Belinda Christian Rucker, as she was named by her parents, was born in 1968 into an illustrious military family — her maternal grandfather, Sir Harold Pyman, was Commander-in-Chief of Allied Forces in Europe and a recipient of the Knight Grand Cross and Distinguished Service Order.

The daughter of commodity broker, Patrick Rucker, Chrissie, as she was known, grew up in Kent and attended £5,275-a-term Combe Bank School in Kent. Her parents divorced, and aged seven, she and her younger sister, Jo, went with their mother Rosemary, a horse breeder, to live with their new step-father, estate agent Jeremy Calcutt.

Those days, she recalled, were happy but chaotic. ‘My mother was really only interested in her horses,’ she said, ‘so the stables were immaculate, the house a tip.’

It was all a far cry from the vision Rucker would later create of domestic interiors as a haven of white and light. Her early ambitions lay in fashion. While at Lucy Clayton she studied dressmaking and design.

But as a teenager in London in the late Eighties, Rucker seemed intent on immersing herself in a ‘Sloane Ranger’ lifestyle.

In 1987, she was a debutante at the Savoy hotel’s Berkeley Ball, where she and fellow socialite and fashion journalist Plum Sykes were among a select bunch of girls chosen by judges including hairdresser Vidal Sassoon and fashion designer Jean Muir to appear in the Berkeley Dress Show.

Wedding dress designer Anneliese Sharpe, who was also on the judging panel, recalls that even among the ‘incredibly beautiful, leggy’ girls who paraded in front of her, desperate to be picked, 18-year-old Rucker stood out.

Cannily, she used her introduction to Sharpe to ask for work experience. ‘Chrissie used to come every day,’ says Sharp. ‘She was completely different from the other debutantes. She was incredibly hard-working with no airs and graces.’

However, Rucker decided that life as a designer was not what she wanted after all. She began work at Conde Nast, the owner of several glossy magazines including Vogue and Tatler, first as a receptionist, then as a fashion assistant.

She enrolled on a journalism course, later describing it as a ‘complete waste of time’, and flitted from there to Clarins, where she worked as a PR girl. She was poached from there by Harper & Queen’s health and beauty editor Tina Gaudoin in 1991.

Gaudoin recalls: ‘She was so efficient and impressive, I said: “Are you interested in coming to work for me?” She dropped off her CV at 5am. I was so struck by her ability to be focused and unflappable that I hired her as my assistant. She has a great humility about her, which I find extraordinary, bearing in mind she is so successful.’ By the time she met her future husband, Rucker was still struggling to work out exactly what she wanted to do with her life.

But although she fell in love with Old Etonian Nick Wheeler, she did not feel the same way about his taste in interiors.

According to Rucker herself: ‘I thought; “This is my chance. I’ll show him what excellent wife material I am.” So I went shopping and kitted it out — I bought white bed linen, white towels, white china, white napkins and white bathrobes. But I just found it impossible to buy plain white sheets on the High Street.

‘The only place you could get them was in department stores and shopping there was a horrible experience. All the salesgirls would look at you snootily, as if to say: “You can’t afford this.”’

While Rucker believed she had spotted a hole in the market, her husband-to-be was perfectly placed to advise her when it came to launching her own business.

Wheeler had set up his shirt company, Charles Tyrwhitt, in 1986 while a geography student at Bristol University.

‘I don’t think I would have done it if it hadn’t been for Nick,’ Rucker later claimed. ‘He guided me through the process, helped me write my first business plan.’

She began by calling up London department stores, pretending to be a journalist writing articles on homeware while ascertaining that up to 50 per cent of their sales involved white linen. She also quizzed PRs, manufacturers and friends.

‘My mission was to bridge the gap between first-class designer quality and what was affordable without the big designer margins,’ she has said.

Rucker used a £6,000 legacy from her grandmother to launch The White Company in March 1994. Wheeler gave her £5,000 in return for a 25 per cent stake, and she also received a £50-a-week enterprise grant.

She produced her first mail-order catalogue, a 12-page leaflet, on a computer in Wheeler’s attic, delivering her first orders in her sister Jo’s Mini Metro. The company was an instant hit, turning over £258,000 in its first year, but Rucker remained committed to hard graft, working 16-hour days, right up until the birth of her first child.

Since then, The White Company has gone from strength to strength. In 2010, Rucker was made an MBE for services to the retail industry, attracting mirth among some palace officials because of the black outfit that she wore to receive the honour at Windsor Castle.

She and her husband — together with their four children aged from ten to 18 — now reap the rewards of their entrepreneurial spirt.

They almost split up when he failed to propose during a romantic holiday in Thailand the year Rucker launched her business. Upon returning to the UK, a feisty Rucker gave him his marching orders, storming into his office and returning his £5,000 investment in cash.

A shell-shocked Wheeler left the money on the roof of his sports car and drove off without it. When the couple did finally marry in 1995, Rucker gave him back one per cent of the company as a wedding gift.

As a 99 per cent stake-holder, however, it is Rucker who remains at the head of a retail empire which has revolutionised tastes in home furnishings, a woman who continues to live and breathe the colour that made her a multi-millionaire.

‘For me, white is timeless and always very relevant,’ she insists. ‘Wherever you live, whatever your style, white works.’
