Suicide: Former pastor Scott Sechrist took his own life on Tuesday one week before his sexual abuse trial was due to start

A former Pennsylvania pastor has killed himself one week before he was to stand trial for molesting a nine-year-old girl 25-years ago.

Scott Sechrist, 61, was discovered in his Red Cedar, Levittown home on Tuesday and police confirmed that they found a note near to his body.

The girl, who is now in her 30s, first reported the sexual abuse in 1992, but claimed the molestations began three years prior to that.

The Levittown Now reported previously that the girl recanted the allegations in 1992 because she feared she would be taken away from her mother.

Bucks County prosecutor Jennifer Schorn said Sechrist's suicide note maintained his innocence but she did not elaborate further.

Sechrist had served as pastor of the First Baptist Church of Morrisville and allegedly knew the girl's family from the church.

According to police, the woman told a detective that Sechrist began sexually assaulting her by grabbing her butt.

He reportedly told her it was 'cute' when she was in fifth grade inside a Bristol Township home. 

The assaults continued during evening prayer sessions that lasted for 10 to 15 minutes.

Authorities alleged Sechrist’s behavior escalated to intercourse and happened multiple times a week over the course of two years.

She said that the behavior stopped when she was 12-years-old.

Sechrist was awaiting trial on 20 counts of involuntary deviant sexual intercourse and related counts.

District Judge Robert Wagner released Sechrist on $500,000 unsecured bail.
