The family of a 26-year-old pregnant Georgia woman who died along with her unborn child in a car crash on Saturday afternoon, are grasping to understand how this could happen.

Tiffany Robbins, of Acworth, who was seven months pregnant, was conscious and alert at the scene of the accident in Cherokee County, according to police, but later died from internal injuries at Kennestone Hospital.

Doctors performed an emergency cesarean section on Robbins, but neither she nor the baby survived.

‘You did a great job raising Tiffany Robbins and please be at peace knowing that. None of this seems fair. I am crushed too... The tears keep flowing. Hopefully the pain will ease up as each day passes and the memories will be strong. I love you, Sis! We will get through this together!’
