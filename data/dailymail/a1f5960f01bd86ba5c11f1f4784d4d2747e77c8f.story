Sir Hugh Orde, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said police are under increasing pressure to record 'playground high jinx' as crimes

Police are under increasing pressure to record 'playground high jinx' as crimes, one of the country's most senior officers said last night.

Officers are regularly criticised for not adding petty pranks and boisterous escapades by youngsters to official records, Sir Hugh Orde revealed.

In one case police dealt with three eight-year-olds caught bearing their bottoms at passing motorists by simply taking them home and informing their parents.

And in another an officer did the 
same when he was called to a 10-year-old boy and a younger friend who 
were throwing around stolen penny sweets.

But
 official inspectors later said both incidents should have been recorded
 as crimes, potentially triggering a full inquiry, even when the 
participants could not be prosecuted because they were below the age of 
criminal responsibility.

Speaking
 yesterday, Sir Hugh, said the trend is causing 'real frustration' to 
chief constables who believe they should have discretion to focus their 
efforts elsewhere.

He said:
 'The point is less around the individual cases than the impact of a 
process that obscures the detail and can deliver a false impression of 
policing that ill informs the public.

'The
 aim must be to improve policing and that is best achieved within a 
profession which has the maturity to discuss and learn, not condemn 
failures.'

Police crime 
recording remains in the spotlight after a series of scandals about 
tricks and cheats used by forces to manipulate all-important figures.

MPs have lambasted forces for 'gaming' statistics by reclassifying crimes and under-recording serious offences to put a gloss on their performance.

Last year one chief constable broke ranks to admit that an 'obsession' with reducing crime is leading some officers to manipulate figures.

Sir Hugh suggested Tom Winsor, the Government-appointed Chief Inspector of Constabulary, has overcompensated by toughening up the crime-recording regime.

Sir Hugh said the trend is causing 'real frustration' to chief constables who believe they should have discretion to focus their efforts elsewhere

Speaking at the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) annual conference, he said complex policing situations are being over-simplified by bureaucrats.

He said: 'One chief constable told me that Her Majesty's Inspectors had challenged him on a set of circumstances involving an officer who responded to a call where three young boys aged eight had chosen to bare their bottoms at passing motorists.

'He dealt with the matter by escorting the boys home, speaking to the parents and leaving. If my eight-year-old had behaved in a similar way I would be entirely satisfied and indeed grateful to the officer.

'But apparently that should have been recorded as a crime.'

He added: 'I still remember learning that it was an irrefutable presumption at common law that a child aged under 10 is incapable of committing a crime.' An interim report into the crime recording standards of all police forces in England and Wales was published last month and a final version is expected later this year.

Crime records are governed by strict standards laid down by the Home Office and the National Crime Recording Standard.

In response a spokesman for HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) denied applying pressure to police forces to do 'anything improper'.

He said: 'The integrity of police recorded crime is important so that police chiefs know the patterns of offending behaviour in their areas, and can deploy their resources with the maximum of efficiency and effectiveness.

'HMIC inspects against the rules as they stand. There is no question of HMIC deciding what should and should not be recorded as a crime.

'Making an administrative record of a criminal offence reported by a victim does not and cannot criminalise anyone.

'The choices the police then make in relation to the course of action to be taken are at the discretion of investigating officers and ultimately Chief Constables.

'The age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is ten.  No criminal proceedings could be taken against an under-age child.

'It is a common feature in the sphere of public accountability that when entities are held closely and firmly to account, they sometimes dislike and resist it. The police service is no different.'
