The FA’s International Committee, who used to hire and fire England managers, are now marginalised to such an extent that they don’t even stay in the same hotel as the team on away trips.

Much to the upset of the blazers who travelled to Scotland for Tuesday’s friendly, the FA booked them into the Radisson Blu hotel in Glasgow, while manager Roy Hodgson and his backroom staff, plus the players, had rooms at the Hilton some distance away.

The blazers want and expect the new separate-hotel policy to be short-lived, but it looks likely to outlast the increasingly irrelevant International Committee.

The two-hotel idea stemmed from a post-World Cup presentation given by performance chief Dave Reddin who, together with technical director designate Dan Ashworth, seemingly calls most of the shots on England matters off the field.

Reddin told the FA board that he believed the 80-strong World Cup entourage was far too big and Hodgson felt there were too many people mingling with his players in the hotel at meal-times and on match days — leading to the changes.

Meanwhile, Leicester head of football operations Andrew Neville has replaced Sunderland chief Margaret Byrne on the dysfunctional International Committee.

Byrne has never been seen anywhere near a senior England match, raising the question why a busy football club executive such as her was ever put on a glad-handing committee in the first place.

Former FA chairman David Bernstein’s suggestion that England should boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia, in protest at FIFA’s running of the game, has understandably being given short shrift at Wembley. The FA inside view is that Bernstein would never have recommended such drastic action while in office, where he was very much a consensus-led figure.

Twickenham’s rampant commercialism saw the QBE sponsors’ logo behind the posts painted on the grass just half a metre from the try line, causing confusion to referee Nigel Owens in the England v All Blacks match. It has now been moved back all of another half-metre.

Meanwhile, a £1 deposit on beer glasses has led to kids rummaging in rubbish bins around the concourse in the hope of making a quick buck, but the eco-friendly RFU counter that there has been a 40 per cent drop in wastage.

The final casualty of England’s World Cup debacle in Brazil looks to be an executive with team sponsors Vauxhall, who were part of the top-heavy travelling circus. Chris Hornbuckle was given his marching orders by the popular FA partners.

RFU losing Beeb battle

Even the intervention of RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie doesn’t look like preventing BBC 5 Live from downgrading the autumn international series, despite radio offering the only live coverage of games on the Beeb.

Such is the power of football that England v Australia — the struggling home team’s last Test against a southern-hemisphere side before the World Cup — is due to be relegated to 5 Live Sports Extra because it clashes with run-of-the-mill Premier League matches.

Ritchie was asked to help by rugby factions within the Beeb, concerned at the way such a showcase occasion was being treated. 

A BBC spokeswoman said rugby would receive more airtime on Sports Extra but a final scheduling decision would be made next week. 

The Ofcom investigation into the Premier League’s selling of football rights is not expected to affect the tender for the next three-year deal starting in the first quarter of 2015. 

But the Ofcom probe is confusing to say the least — acting on Virgin Media’s complaint that the current 41 per cent of matches sold to TV leads to higher subscription costs, while also looking to preserve the 3pm Saturday kick-off fixtures from where extra TV matches would have to be drawn.
