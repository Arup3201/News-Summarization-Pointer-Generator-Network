Better late than never for Ian Poulter, who on Thursday produced what he considers his best round of a dreadful year at the penultimate tournament of the season. A dusted-off putter from better times made the difference, leaving him second in the Turkish Airlines Open after an eight-under-par round.

By his own four-letter description, Poulter’s 2014 campaign has been woeful, with injuries, a missed cut at The Open, Twitter rows and an underwhelming Ryder Cup by his standards. In that time his world ranking tumbled from 12th to 44, leaving him in danger of slipping out of the top 50 for the first time since September 2006.

But Thursday afternoon there were signs that the 38-year-old was somewhere close to his best, following a sixth-placed finish in China last week with a sublime round of seven birdies, an eagle and only one dropped shot.

He cited the new Titleist clubs he switched to after the Ryder Cup as well a putter he unearthed from the 2013 Open, in which he finished third.

‘I’d played s*** all year,’ Poulter said. ‘There’s no other word for it. It was disappointing. There was nothing good coming out of 2014.

‘It’s been tough to take, it really has. I thought I was doing the right things at the start of the year and took a massive step backwards with injuries and trying to play through them is not good.

‘That’s a horrible spiral to be in when you’ve got two tour cards to make sure you maintain. Thankfully I’m feeling right now.’

Poulter added: ‘I am having a boost at the right time. Sometimes you get a new car and it makes you feel good. I got new sticks in the bag. It felt great to be able to do that and that they worked really quickly.

‘When you get something new you are excited to use it. I have been excited for the last couple of weeks. I am happy with everything.’

Miguel Angel Jimenez led by a stroke on a day that all but eliminated Jamie Donaldson’s chances of snatching the Race to Dubai from Rory McIlroy.

The Welshman needs to win here and in Dubai next week while hoping McIlroy finishes outside the top five when he returns in the desert. But a level-par round of 72 left the Ryder Cup player nine shots behind Jimenez, while the other two Race contenders in Sergio Garcia and Victor Dubuisson were horribly off the pace, shooting rounds of 75 and 77 respectively.

Meanwhile, Turkey insists it is still bidding to host the 2022 Ryder Cup, a day after announcing their withdrawal over environmental concerns.

Wales' Jamie Donaldson is now highly unlikely to catch Rory McIlroy in the Race to Dubai

The Welshman had a poor day and will hope to recover at in Antalya over the next few rounds
