A key witness who helped jail Dale Cregan, who killed two woman police officers, is homeless abroad after fleeing Britain because of threats

A key witness who helped jail one-eyed police killer Dale Cregan is now living with her children in a garage abroad after fleeing Britain in fear.

The mother and her children were threatened on Facebook after giving evidence against Cregan, who was jailed for the murder of police officers Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone, as well as two men.

Terrified of reprisals, the woman spent more than a year living in six towns and cities across England but eventually fled Britain to avoid revenge attacks and is now homeless. 

The woman braved death threats to give four days of evidence at Cregan's trial in February 2013.

The gangster was jailed for life and told he would never be released after he was convicted of murdering the police officers, as well as his rival Mark Short and Short's father, plus three separate counts of attempted murder. 

Cregan, with the help of Damian 'Scarface' Gorman and Luke Livesey, who were both jailed for at least 33 years, shot dead Short Jr in a pub in May 2012. 

Months later he killed Short's father David.

On September 18 that year, Cregan made a hoax call to the police, with officers Hughes, 23, and Bone, 32, arriving shortly afterwards to investigate.

When they arrived, the murderer shot both women at least eight times and threw a grenade at them, killing both women.

The witness' evidence ensure Cregan was convicted, but now she is homeless, destitute and living in a garage abroad with her children.

She says the witness protection programme cut all financial help soon after she left the UK a year ago.

Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, who chose not to disclose which country she now lives in, the mother said she wanted to return to Britain, but needs money from the Government to do so.

She said: 'I've told the police we're in serious trouble here. There are no jobs. My kids aren't in school. 

'There are no places for them. We're sleeping on a mattresses and a couch in someone's garage. I don't care about myself. I just want something better for my children. I want them back in the UK. That's where their lives are.

'We're getting food from a local family and a church. We didn't celebrate on Christmas day.

'I've paid a very high price for helping the police, too high. I will always stick to my principles and I want the law to prevail but I've had to pay too high a price.

'I can't keep watching my children suffering every day. I don't want to blame the police but I feel abandoned by the Government itself.

'I'd rather risk it in England than see my children suffering. I'm at the point where I think they're better off without me.

'I'm in turmoil because I opened my mouth and put a thug behind bars. Cregan and the rest have food, clothing and even education in prison. Their wives and girlfriends have lives and jobs. What have I got for my trouble? Humiliation.

'They have a better situation than we have by far. I would rather be in their shoes, any day. It's a humiliating position to be in and the children are suffering. I've handed my CV into 73 different places without any joy. There is just no work.'

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police, speaking for the north west regional witness protection service, said: 'We do not comment on any witness or witness protection measures.'

The key witness helped put Cregan behind bars for the killings that shocked the nation, but came under intense threats from gangland thugs before the trial.

On the night Mark Short was shot dead, the woman saw one of Cregan's co-accused, Damian Gorman, outside her house with two other people.

Giving evidence to the trial via video link, she said she also found clothes dumped in a garden next to her home the next day.

She said she faced threats after Short was killed, including one of the 'one-eyed Scotchman' - a reference to Cregan - paying her a visit. 

The trial heard Gorman had told her: 'You better make sure that you keep your f****** mouth shut or you're dead... You see these people, what they are capable of. You're f****** next. You and your f****** kids.' 

'He said, "Be careful because you don't want the one-eyed Scotchman coming to [your] door"... If I said anything to the police,' she said.

She said he pulled his finger under his chin and across his throat and told her: 'You don't want to die and you don't want your kids to die.'

'He was always threatening me. The message he gave me was clear,' she added.
