His face has appeared in sandwiches, on tree stumps and even in a jar of Marmite.

Now a stunned dog owner has spotted the image of Jesus in the ear of her wet puppy. 

Rachel Evans, 25, was bathing her mini Yorkshire terrier Dave in the bathroom sink when she took some photographs of the dog enjoying his shower.

However, when she showed the pictures to her boyfriend James Williams, 28, she spotted the face of the Son of God in the pet’s soggy ear.

Stunned dog owner Rachel Evans, 25, spotted the image of Jesus in her terrier Dave's ear after looking back at a photograph of the dog enjoying a shower in her bathroom sink at her home in Swansea

'I was a but freaked out to be honest,' said Miss Evans, who works for the DVLA in Swansea, south Wales.

'I am a bit superstitious and it’s quite spooky.

'At first I didn’t see anything at all. We were just giving them a bath in the sink and taking silly photos and selfies because they looked cute.

'About an hour later I showed my partner and he said "can you see that face?"

Miss Evans said the image of the face, which she though resembled Jesus (right) was 'spooky', and that she was 'a bit freaked out' when she saw it

'We looked a but closer and realised it looked like Jesus. It’s a bit strange.'

Dog-lover Miss Evans shares eight-month-old Dave with her house mate Lewis Evans, 24, along with a seven-month-old chihuahua called Gilbert and whippet Flo, one.

The pair hope the divine appearance is a good omen, and she added: 'We’ve not long moved into the house, so that would be good.'

The face of Jesus has previously been spotted on a drainpipe, on a half eaten taco, in a burned frying pan, in the lid of a Marmite jar and even on an ultrasound scan in 2006.

The Messiah's image was also spotted on Google Earth in a field in Hungary in 2010.
