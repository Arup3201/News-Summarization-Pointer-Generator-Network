His wife has won over fans and fashion critics alike with her foray into fashion and now it seems David Beckham is set on emulating her.

But although Victoria Beckham has made a name for herself as a purveyor of posh frocks, former footballer David has a less discerning clientele in mind.

Following the success of his underwear range, H&M has unveiled a new children's collection designed by the star and intended to compliment the existing David Beckham Bodywear line.

And as the first photos of the range reveal, Mrs Beckham isn't the only family member with a talent for fashion design.

The David Beckham Bodywear range for children includes chic grey marl vest tops, a funky granddad t-shirt and sets of striped smalls that ought to prove stylish enough for the Beckhams' fastidious brood.

Described by H&M as a 'cool yet comfortable range', the pieces designed by the retired footballing ace mirror the Spring collection created by Beckham for his adult underwear line.  

But those desperate to get their hands 
on the collection will have to wait a bit longer - the pieces won't 
appear for another month and prices are yet to be confirmed.

Stylish: The new range of pint-sized smalls is set to leave fathers green with envy

Happily for envious fathers, the adult range, which will be unveiled later this month, also includes plenty of stylish stripes. 

According to the Swedish retailer, men in pursuit of the perfect pants can expect wide stripes on long sleeve Henleys, while smaller stripes will appear on vests, long-johns and trunks. 

A spokesman added: 'Pieces such as the grey jersey pyjama shorts show the heritage athletic influence, which comes from David's own love of vintage sportswear.'
