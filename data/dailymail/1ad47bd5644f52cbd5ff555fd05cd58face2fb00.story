The family of a woman who went on a huge shopping spree after £52,000 was accidentally transferred into her account yesterday sprang to her defence, claiming she was just ‘making hay while the sun shines’.

She simply ‘seized a good opportunity’ and did what any other young person would have done in her situation, they claimed.

Michaela Hutchings, 23, spent £9,000 on expensive designer shoes, handbags and sunglasses in a two-day spending splurge after finding the transfer from her council.

Cheers: Michaela Hutchings went on a spending spree after she found her £52,000 in her bank account. She was on Monday found guilty of dishonesty and retaining a wrongly credited bank transfer

Instead of reporting the error – as the law requires – she also gave her mother £1,000 in cash, and put £40,000 into a savings account, before she was caught by police on April 24 last year.

Her grandmother, Phyllis Hutchings, 67, blamed the council, insisting that Hutchings was a ‘good girl’ who ‘doesn’t deserve’ to be punished.

‘Michaela’s not to blame,’ she added. ‘She’s just done what a lot of other people would have done. A lot of youngsters would think, wow-wee, make hay while the sun shines.’

Her grandfather, Roy Hutchings, 71, who lives with his wife in Lichfield in Staffordshire, added: ‘She didn’t think what she was doing was illegal.’

Dozens of friends and family also supported the mother of one on Facebook yesterday.

A friend, Emma Armstrong, said she would have withdrawn all the cash then ran away, adding ‘that’s not dishonest, it’s seizing the moment!’.

Another, Abiegayle Keisha Warburton, said: ‘Its only the councils fault not yours i know a few people thats had random money and spent it.’ [sic]

Others said they would have done ‘exactly the same’.

Hutchings’ mother Elaine last night blamed her daughter’s crime on her ex-partner, who cannot be named for legal reasons.

She said Hutchings had been pressurised into spending the windfall by her ‘money-grabbing’ ex who is now in custody over a drugs-related offence.

‘He was the one behind this, but 
Michaela is the one left with the bad reputation,’ she said. ‘He wanted 
to spend it all – he wanted all these expensive jeans and belts and 
spent some of the money when she wasn’t even with him.’

Under the 1968 Theft Act, if you realise money has been paid into your bank account by mistake, you must repay it.

Keeping the unexpected windfall could lead to a charge of ‘dishonestly retaining wrongful credit’ and to a prison sentence of up to  ten years.

In rare cases defendants have successfully argued that they did not realise they had been paid the money in error and have not had to return it.

Mrs Hutchings, who lives in a large country home in Lichfield with her husband and Michaela’s father, Sean, said their daughter has ‘gone into hiding’.

She added: ‘He left her terrified. Even though he’s in prison, we are worried about what he could do to her.’

Hutchings was found guilty of dishonesty and retaining a wrongly credited bank transfer when she appeared at Stafford Crown Court on Monday. 

Recorder Derek Desmond accepted she had been encouraged to spend by her boyfriend.

Hutchings, who works part-time at her parents’ vehicle hire company, was given a 12-month community order and told to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.

The court heard an administrative error meant Lichfield District Council accidentally transferred £52,000 into her account. Hutchings allegedly ignored repeated phone calls and visits and claimed she thought the money was an inheritance.

She will face a further investigation under the Proceeds of Crime Act relating to the £40,000 she invested.
