Visitors to this year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference could be forgiven for assuming they had accidentally stumbled upon a Star Trek convention ... if the people in costume weren't some of the most powerful in the world.

Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin were among 21 world leaders who attended the summit of Pacific Rim nations in Beijing today dressed in traditional Chinese tunics.

But when the official photograph of the event was beamed around the world, many thought they better resembled the likes of Spock of Captain Kirk from the hit television and film franchise.

Beam me up: Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin (pictured alongside Chinese premier and event host Xi Jinping and wife Peng Liyuan) were among 21 world leaders who attended the summit of Pacific Rim nations in Beijing today dressed in traditional Chinese tunics

Beam me up: Barack Obama also donned the burgundy outfit ahead of a meeting with Xi Jinping later in the day

Star Trek: When the official photograph of the event was beamed around the world, many thought they better resembled the likes of Spock of Captain Kirk from the hit television and film franchise

Smart: Mr Xi appeared to complement Mr Putin on his attire as the Chinese leader's wife looked on

Meet and greet: Then came Barack Obama's turn to receive the compliment

'Obama wearing Star Trek jacket in China? Someone please beam him up,' wrote Steve Miller on Twitter.

Jami_USA added: 'Is this a new Star Trek Episode?' 

However, AFP journalist Katy Lee pointed out that the APEC has a 'rich tradition' in dressing its members traditional clothing of the country holding the summit.

'Important to remember Obama's suit is part of rich tradition of flamboyant APEC fashion. See Kerry, 2013,' she wrote, referring to the Balinese 'endek' woven shirt worn by Secretary of State John Kerry and leaders attending the summit in Indonesia last year.

Meanwhile at the shoot, U.S. president Barack Obama appeared in no mood to break the ice with his Russian counterpart, and even looked away when the two crossed paths.

Putin took centre stage at the official photocall, placed at the middle of leaders next to Chinese president and event host Xi Jinping.

Mr Obama, however, was left wedged between the wife of Indonesia's president and South Korea's leader, Park Geun-Hye, on the periphery of the photograph.

Tension: With Russia-West ties at their lowest point since the Cold War, amid the dispute over Ukraine, the strain in their personal relations was clearly visible

When the photograph was taken and the heads of state filed off stage, Obama seemed to turn his head as Putin came past, rather than catch his eye.  

The two leaders last met in June, when they exchanged a few words during a ceremony in France marking the D-Day invasion anniversary. 

With Russia-West ties at their lowest point since the Cold War, amid the dispute over Ukraine, the strain in their personal relations was clearly visible. 

Together: After the photo call, Obama and Putin joined Mr Xi, his wife and the other delegates to watch a spectacular firework display

Bird's Nest: The firework display was held at the Bird's Nest National Stadium on the sidelines of the APEC Summit, in Beijing, originally built for the 2008 Olympics

Appearances: But Obama and Putin did not seem to talk to each other despite their close proximity. Instead Obama joked with Mr Xi while Putin spoke with China's First Lady, Peng Liyuan

No stranger to cold: Putin wasted no time in trying to charm his hosts and wrapped his blanket around Ms Peng to keep her warm

Keeping warm: She appeared to appreciate the gesture as Barack Obama looked away

And, as these pictures show, today was no different. 

However, Putin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, has said that no meeting has been set but that Putin and Obama have 'a good chance' to meet on the sidelines. Ushakov emphasized that Putin wasn't shunning such a meeting.

In Washington, White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice said that while there were no plans for a formal meeting between Obama and Putin, 'I wouldn't be at all surprised if they had some informal communication.'
