'It was not a simple decision,' Alonso told TZ. 'It is never easy to leave Madrid because they are a top club, but I felt it was the right time.

'I had the opportunity to go to another top club in another league. Maybe it was the last chance to live a new experience.

'I wanted a fresh start in a new city. I felt it was best for my career.'

Alonso has settled in well with the Bavarian club claiming five man of the match awards so far this season.

The 32-year-old has been in superb from for Bayern helping the club to six victories so far this season.

'I'm delighted,' he added. 'I've fitted into the team well and have a good relationship with the coach.

'I talk to him a lot because I know what he wants from me, so it's been easy to come into a winning club like Bayern.

'I was surprised to be so important from the start because I barely knew the team, but football is a universal language.'
