Less than two weeks after the U.S. let a top secret spy drone slip through its fingers in Iran, Washington appears to have lost another.

Officials say an unmanned military drone crashed this morning at an airport on the island nation of Seychelles.

The U.S. Embassy in Mauritius said the U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone was not armed and that the crash caused no injuries.

Crashed: A U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone like the one seen here - which are most often used to monitor Al Qaeda-linked militants, crashed in Seychelles this morning

Lina Laurence of Seychelles' civilian aviation authority said the drone developed engine problems minutes into its flight and needed to land as soon as possible Tuesday morning.

'But due to its accelerated landing speed, the aircraft was unable to stop before the runway's end,' Laurence said.

The embassy's statement said the cause of the crash is being investigated.

'It has been confirmed that this drone was unarmed and its failure was due to mechanical reasons,' Laurence said.

The affected runway was closed for about 10 minutes as a 'precautionary measure,' but was later reopened with no disruption to airport operations, Laurence said.

The U.S. military and the civilian aviation authority of Seychelles have coordinated to remove the debris, officials said.

The MQ-9 Reaper is a medium-to-high altitude unmanned aircraft system with sensors that can provide real-time data.

The Seychelles-based MQ-9s, which are used to monitor piracy activities in and around the Indian Ocean, don't carry weapons, though they have the capability to do so.

Tuesday's crash follows last week's claim by Iran that it seized a drone identified as the RQ-170 Sentinel. Tehran said it was captured over the country's east.

The nearly intact drone was displayed on state TV and flaunted as a victory for Iran in a complicated intelligence and technological battle with the U.S.

U.S. officials said the unmanned aircraft malfunctioned and was not brought down by Iran.

President Barack Obama said Monday the U.S. wants the top-secret aircraft back and has delivered a formal request for the return of the surveillance drone, though it isn't hopeful that Iran will comply.

The U.S. has used drones to hunt down Al Qaeda-linked militants in Somalia and Yemen, among other countries.

Their humming is a constant feature in the sky in many of the major towns in southern Somalia, especially the capital city and the militant-controlled southern port of Kismayo.

It was not clear if drones operated out of the Seychelles are used for that purpose.

Defiant: During an interview on Venezuelan television last night, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad claimed his scientists can already control the spy plane

Speaking through an interpreter, Mr 
Ahmadinejad said: 'There are people here who have been able to control 
this spy plane, who can surely analyse this plane's system also.

'In 
any case, now we have this spy plane.'

President Obama yesterday confirmed that the U.S. wants the top secret aircraft back.

During a White House news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Malik, Mr Obama said: 'We have asked for it back. We'll see how the Iranians respond.'

The president refused to comment on what the Iranians might learn from studying the downed aircraft.

U.S. Defence Secretary Leon Panetta 
said it is difficult to know 'just frankly how much they're going to be 
able to get from having obtained those parts'.

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Mr Panetta said they are not optimistic about getting the drone back because of recent Iranian behaviour that Clinton said indicated 'that the path that Iran seems to be going down is a dangerous one for themselves and the region'.

Keeping it: Iran says it will not return the US RQ-170 Sentinel high-altitude reconnaissance drone that crashed in Iran this week

Speaking to reports at a U.S. State Department news conference with British
Foreign Secretary William Hague, she added: 'We submitted a formal 
request for the return of our lost equipment as we would in any 
situation to any government around the world.

'Given
Iran's behaviour to date we do not expect them to comply but we are 
dealing with all of these provocations and concerning actions taken by 
Iran in close concert with our closest allies and partners.'

Mr Panetta said the request to return the drone was appropriate.

He said: 'I don't expect that that will happen. But I think it's important to make that request.'

Worries: U.S. officials are concerned about the Iranians potentially sharing or selling what they could have recovered of the aircraft to China or Russia

Neither Mr Obama nor Mrs Clinton would 
provide details of the drone request, but diplomatic exchanges between 
Washington to Tehran are often handled by Switzerland, which represents 
U.S. interests in Iran.

The
State Department said yesterday that the Swiss ambassador to Iran met with
Iranian foreign ministry officials last week but refused to say what 
they discussed.

Iran television reported yesterday that Iranian experts were in the final stages of
recovering data from the RQ-170 Sentinel, which went down in the country 
earlier this month.

Tehran 
has cited the capture as a victory for Iran and displayed the nearly 
intact drone on state TV. U.S. officials say the aircraft malfunctioned 
and was not brought down by Iran.

Broke down: US officials say Iran had nothing to do with the drone crashing to earth. They contend it simply malfunctioned
