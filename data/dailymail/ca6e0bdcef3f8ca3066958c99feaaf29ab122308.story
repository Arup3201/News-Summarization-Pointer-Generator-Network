Goodbye, goji berry. Adios, acai. Bye-bye, bee pollen. Sayonar, spirulina.

We could go on, but the short of it is there's a new superfood in town, one set to blow the others out of the alkalised water, and its name is the buffaloberry.

Small, red, sweet but bitter, and native to North American soil where its hardy shrubs need very little nurturing in order to flourish, this new bundle of health (it's jam-packed with cancer-busting antioxidant lycopene) is actually not very new at all.

The buffaloberry has the potential to take over from goji berries and become the most popular superfood in 2014

The berries are extremely popular with bears in North and South Dakota

The edible berries - also known as shepherdia - grow primarily on marginal land on Indian Reservations in North and South Dakota, and have traditionally been 
eaten by Native Americans.

But the new findings about its health-giving properties, published in the Journal of Food Science, suggest it 
could be a commercially valuable food crop, especially for regions in need of 
economic development.

The fruit contains extremely high levels of 
lycopene, the antioxidant more commonly associated
 with tomatoes, as well as an acidic compound called methyl-lycopenoate, a natural food colourant.

The berry's tartness is also a result of the high levels of phenolic antioxidants, which help prevent cancer and stall 
cellular aging.

Plus, its acidity has lead drinks producers to consider using it to make wine.

Commercial production of the buffaloberry is, at present, limited, but researchers told Business Insider that the 'potential for growing, consuming, and marketing buffaloberry fruit on and around Midwestern Native American Reservations provides both and economic and nutritional opportunity that should be exploited'.
