A pensioner faces being taken to court by a multi-millionaire Tory peer in a row over a patch of land next to his recycling yard.

Tom McAllister, who runs a pallet recycling firm, is at loggerheads with staff at landowner and banker Lord Home’s country estate.

Mr McAllister says he decided to spruce up an ‘eyesore’ patch of land at the entrance to his premises after a search to find out who owned it proved fruitless.

The businessman claimed he spent £10,000 to clear the 0.3 acre site at Rigside, Lanarkshire, and now uses it to park his trailers and give out free fire wood to the local community.

However, lawyers for Lord Home have now insisted it is part of his country estate and an adjoining estate owned by the Carmichael family.

The peer’s family company Douglas and Angus Estates have threatened to take Mr MCAllister to court if he does not vacate the land.

Dispute: The legal wrangle centres around a patch of land at the entrance to Mr McAllister's premises which he is currently using to park his trucks and give out free wood to the local community

Investment: Mr McAllister claims he spent around £10,000 clearing the 
site and that if he is removed from the land it would have a significant
effect on his business

Mr McAllister, 67, said: 'We have spent a lot of time and money clearing the site which was previously a dumping ground.

'We checked with the Registers of Scotland and couldn’t find a clean title for the land so we decided to clear it ourselves.

'I hadn’t heard anything for a couple of
years and then this lawyer’s letter arrived out of the blue telling us 
to clear the land within seven days.

'We use the site to park trailers and to dispense fire wood for free to the local community, which is much appreciated in an area of high unemployment.

'If we are removed from the land we would have nowhere to park the trailers and it would have a significant effect on our business.

'Lord Home’s estate have teamed up with the Carmichael estate and are now threatening to take us to court, it’s ridiculous.

'The site is of absoultely no use to them but they seem hell-bent on removing us.

'I’m determined to fight this.'Lord Home is chairman of the Queen’s bank Coutts and son of ex-Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home.

He has sparked fury by brokering a deal to let Scottish Coal mine his land in Lanarkshire for a fee.

Last year, environmental protestors invaded the ground of his mansion on the estate and dug up his lawn.

Last night(FRI), Henry Birch, the factor of Douglas and Angus Estates, said: 'The site was clear and unobstructed when Mr McAllister took it over.

'It was previously unclear if ourselves or the Carmichael estate owned the land but we are now both registered as joint owners.

'We have offered in the past to lease the land to Mr McAllister but he has not taken up our offer.

'We felt that our only recourse was to take legal action.

'If he does not vacate the site we will take action to forcibly remove him.

David Douglas-Home, the 15th Earl of Home Lord Home, is the son of the late former Conservative Prime Minister Alec Douglas Home.
