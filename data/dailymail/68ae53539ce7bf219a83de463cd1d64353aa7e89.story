A mother has died after being stabbed in the neck in broad daylight on a busy London street.

Horrified onlookers watched in terror yesterday as a knifeman casually walked up to the 42-year-old victim and stabbed her at least four times in the neck before calmly lighting a cigarette as he stood over her prone body.

According to witnesses, the mother was on her way home after dropping her child off at school when she was confronted by a man who lashed out knifing her multiple times in a frenzied attack.

He then coolly rolled a cigarette as he 
stood over the woman, who still had a knife embedded in her neck, until 
police officers arrived to arrest him.

Police and forensics at the scene in North London where a woman was stabbed to death in the street

The mother, 42, was stabbed in the neck four times at this location in Tottenham, north London

The victim was taken to a central London hospital where she was pronounced dead.

Last night police were quizzing a 46-year-old who was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder.

Police believe that the man was known to the victim, although they were unable to confirm the nature of their relationship last night.

Eyewitnesses to the murder which happened just before 1pm in Bruce Grove, Tottenham described how the man was led away in handcuffs with his hands covered in blood.

Sergio Fernandes, 21, said: ‘I think these people had issues together.

‘I was talking to a few witnesses and they said he stabbed her up four times in the neck.

‘He stood there knowing he had done something wrong and rolled up a cigarette and let the police take him away.

‘She was lying there with the knife still sticking out of her neck, and he had blood all over his hands.’

The
 co-founder of Unity Radio, based nearby in the Bruce Grove Youth 
Centre, added: ‘People are saying that she had just come back from 
dropping her child off at school.’

The knifeman is said to have attacked the woman before rolling a cigarette over her body in Tottenham

Mental health worker Marcia Williams, 53, spoke to an eyewitness just moments after police arrived.

She said: ‘It seemed to be a random attack, the man just walked up to her and did it.

‘The witness was very shaken up - she said the woman was stabbed in the neck but didn’t go into any other detail.

‘The victim fell right on the floor straightaway.

‘She was still there when I came out but you couldn’t see anything because a police van was blocking the scene.’ Last night Twitter was awash with speculation about the gruesome killing, with some posts suggesting she may have been knifed up to 19 times.

One user, Bella Symoni said: ‘A lady got stabbed in her neck 19 times on bruce grove high road, the poor nurse man.’ Last night forensic officers were still combing the scene where markers could be seen by a discarded bag of tobacco next to a pool of blood.

The victim was taken to a central London hospital where she was pronounced dead after what is thought to be an unprovoked attack

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘Police were called shortly before 1pm on Wednesday, 19 March, to reports of a woman stabbed in Bruce Grove, Tottenham.

‘Officers and London Ambulance Service attended the scene.

‘The 42-year-old victim was taken by ambulance to a central London hospital where she was pronounced dead.

‘Officers believe they know the identity of the deceased, but await formal identification. Next of kin have been informed.

‘A 46-year-old man was arrested at the scene. He has been taken to a north London police station where he remains in custody.’

Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh from the Met’s Homicide and Major Crime Command appealed for witnesses last night.

He said: ‘I need to hear for anyone who was in the Bruce Grove area shortly before 1pm who may have witnessed the incident.

‘Anyone with information should call the incident room on 020 8785 8099. To remain anonymous call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.’
