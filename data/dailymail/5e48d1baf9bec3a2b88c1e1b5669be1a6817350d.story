Ever since those two 'C's first interlinked in the 1920s, Chanel has been one of the most lusted-after brands on the planet.

Its iconic pieces - the little black dress, the tailored suit and the luxe quilted bag to name but a few- have been worn with pride by the fashion elite and copied by designers worldwide for the best part of a century.

From the catwalk to market stalls, fashion is infused with Chanel influence. Who hasn't been offered a plastic Channel bag on a street corner or bought an 'LBD' inspired by Chanel's original'?

But this season the uber brand flipped the Chanel copycat trend on its head.

Their current jewellery collection includes a rather more expensive copy of another iconic design - the sweetie necklace.

Yum: The 'real' sweetie necklace, modeled above, is £754.80 cheaper and tastes good too!

Usually the beaded beauties are priced at around 20p, available at your local newsagent, but now the necklace can be yours for £755 at Chanel. And despite the eye-watering price tag, the designer version isn't even edible - or at best is extremely hard and very bland.

Of course, as with any Chanel design, the fashionable set have latched onto the trend and have been wearing this new souped-up version of the sweetie necklace with pride.

Alexa Chung, back in town recently for London Fashion Week, looked her usual stylish-self sporting the candy chain with a pair of dress-down dungarees.

And Chanel are having no trouble shifting the pricey pastel goods from their stores, along with the matching £975 cuff. 

The designs have also been praised by fashion magazines and bloggers alike for their innovation.

But perhaps there's a touch of 'The Emperor's New Clothes' about this latest trend. Isn't a £754.80 mark up on a 20p item, well, to put it mildly, totally and utterly and absurdly bonkers?

The matching £975 cuff: The famous interlocked 'c's are created out of plastic sweetie-like beads 

'It seems bonkers but it’s fitting with the general fashion movement,' says Daily Mail style editor Eliza Scarborough. 

'First Moschino did the McDonalds fast food collection, and Anya Hindmarch did bags in the form of cereal and kitchen essentials (the Ariel and Daz clutch and Frosties and Coco Pops bags). Fashion seems to have embraced the kitsch idea of nostalgic food and items.

'Even though Chanel is known for being a traditional brand they have been mixing it up with their urban rucksack and trainers on the catwalk, so it’s not completely out of the blue. It’s a tongue in cheek take on the traditional string of pearls

'This general trend has filtered onto the high street already with New Look creating a burger clutch bag and Zara selling a bagel phone case. So, perhaps you may see the 20p version popping up on fashion bloggers soon,' suggests Eliza.

Six-year-old Mia, who recently bought the classic version of the candy necklace with her tooth fairy money, is also in favour of the upgraded designer version.

When shown a picture of the Chanel piece she was enamored by the subtle glitzy detail.

The six-year-old, whose fashion favourites include Hello Kitty necklaces and diamond stick-on earrings, asked: 'Can I have that one instead? I like the sparkly bits.'

But when asked if she would pay £755 pounds for the added sparkle, 3,775 times more than she shelled out on her own one at the sweet shop, she found herself in a financial dilemma.

'I don't have that many teeth and four of mine have already fallen out already so I don't think I will have enough money,' she said. 'But maybe I can get one for my birthday?'

She did have one important question, however: 'What do the sparkly bits taste like?'
