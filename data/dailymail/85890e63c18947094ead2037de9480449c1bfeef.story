Abel Hernandez has caught the eye at Hull City since joining for a club record £10million during the summer - by 'playing in a wig'.

The 24-year-old sported a short hairstyle against Swansea City on December 20, before appearing with shoulder-length dreadlocks and a ponytail eight days later against Leicester.  

The Uruguay international's change has not gone unnoticed, with supporters taking to Twitter to jokingly question whether Hernandez is the 'world's fastest grower of hair'.

Michael King asked: 'Just me who's wondering how Abel Hernandez's hair has grown at an alarming rate? He was bald two weeks ago.' 

While Paul Kite wrote: 'Tom Huddlestone may have got rid of his hair but Abel Hernandez has filled the gap well.'

Hernandez has scored three Premier League goals since joining after the 2014 World Cup, his last coming against Arsenal in a 2-2 draw on October 18 at the Emirates. 

The striker will be keen for another hair-raising experience when Hull travel to London to face Arsenal in the FA Cup third round on Sunday evening.
