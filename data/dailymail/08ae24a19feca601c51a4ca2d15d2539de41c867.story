Appeal: Harold Jellicoe Percival, known affectionately as 'Coe'. Hundreds of people are expected to attend his funeral after it emerged he died with no close friends or relatives

Hundreds of people are expected to attend the funeral of a war veteran they never knew after an appeal for mourners in a local newspaper revealed he died with no close friends or relatives.

Harold Jellicoe Percival, who helped with the famous Dambusters raid during the Second World War, died last month aged 99 in a nursing home.

He was a distant relative of Spencer Perceval, the only British prime minister to be assassinated, and who died in 1812.

Poignantly for the ex-military man, his funeral will take place at 11am tomorrow, as Britain pauses to remember its war dead on Armistice Day.

But
Mr Percival, who served as ground crew with RAF Bomber Command, never 
married, had no children and has no close family members able to attend 
the service at the Lytham Park Crematorium, Lytham St Annes, in 
Lancashire.

An advert was placed in a local paper asking for people to come to his funeral - especially service personnel.

John McCormick, who runs a Facebook page for RAF veterans, said: 'It would be a great shame if this occasion went unattended given Harold's service to his country.

'It is particularly poignant that he should be buried at 11am on November 11.'

Injured serviceman, Sgt Rick Clement, spread the word on Facebook and Twitter and it was quickly picked up and shared by thousands of other people on the social networking sites.

Sgt Clement, who lost his legs while serving in Afghanistan, tweeted his appeal which was picked up by celebrity supporters.

'If you’re in the area give him the send off he deserves. This guy needs and deserves your help.' He wrote on Facebook. 

Comedian Jason Manford retweeted the appeal and wished Sgt Clement luck.

Advert: Hundreds of people are expected to attend the funeral of a war veteran after this advert was placed in a local paper in Lytham. The notice asked for anyone in the services to and attend his funeral and funeral directors Roland L Whitehead and Daughter say there has been lots of enquiries

He also posted a copy of the advert on Facebook and it was shared nearly 30,000 times within ten hours. 

Overwhelmed by the support, the 
funnyman wrote: 'I think the whole town of Lytham St Anne will be out 
for Harold Jellicoe's funeral on Monday. My friend's Dad, the chairman 
of the RAF benevolent fund, is gonna sort some uniformed guys there and 
give him a proper send off. I'm sorry I can't be there myself.

In
May 16 1943, 19 aircraft set out to destroy three dams in the Ruhr 
valley - the Mohne, the Eder and the Sorpe - to damage a vital source of
power to the key industrial area of Germany.

The
Mohne and Eder Dams in the industrial heart of Germany were attacked 
and breached by mines dropped from specially modified Lancasters of 617 
Squadron.

Using bouncing bombs, their daring night-time raid saw the mission hailed a success.

The Sorpe dam was was also attacked by two aircraft and damaged.

A fourth dam, the Ennepe, was reported as being attacked by a single aircraft (O-Orange), but with no damage.

An estimated 1,294 people were killed by floodwaters, but eight of the 19 aircraft that went on the mission failed to return.

There was a loss of 53 aircrew - and three were taken as prisoners of war.

Wing Commander Guy Gibson of 617 Squadron was awarded the Victoria Cross for his part in leading the attack.

'Gotta pity the poor person who's sorting out the buffet!'

Those involved in organising the 
funeral say they have been contacted by veterans' groups and other 
military supporters keen to acknowledge Mr Percival's career.

Edmund
Jacobs, of Roland L Whitehead and Daughter funeral directors, said: 
'We're hoping a few faces will turn up and show their support for a war 
hero.

'It doesn't sit 
well with me that somebody who has served their country can be forgotten
about, that his service can go un-noted. I am sure he would have had a few stories to tell.'

Mr Percival was one of four siblings but lived a 'nomadic lifestyle' after leaving the RAF at the end of the war.

His nephew, David Worsell, said: 'He was a private man, he worked in Australia for a number of years as a decorator and would visit England for holidays.

'He travelled around England with only his backpack.

'He didn't have a postal address, he just used to get everything sent to my mother's address and would go through it when they met up.'

Mr Percival lived in Penge, south London, before joining the RAF.

He was based in the north west of England and became part of the ground crew which helped with the Dambusters, the squadron which was initially formed to destroy dams in the Ruhr valley in Nazi Germany.

The Queen unveiled a memorial to Bomber Command in London last year.

After working in Australia, Mr Percival later retired to England and lived at the Alistre Lodge Nursing and Care Home in Lytham St Annes.

Appeal: Jason Manford's Facebook and Twitter appeal was liked and shared thousands of times within hours

Quip: A few hours after he posted the appeal, Jason Manford was overhwlemed by the public's response

Dambusters: The Mohne and Eder Dams in the industrial heart of Germany were attacked and breached by mines dropped from specially modified Lancasters of 617 Squadron

Memorial: The Bomber Command Memorial in Green Park, London, was unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II last year

He was a distant relative of former 
British prime minister Spencer Perceval, who was shot dead by a bankrupt
broker, John Bellingham, as he entered the House of Commons, in 1812.

Matron Janet Wareing said: 'Harold was a lovely character, very strong-willed and independent.'He was quite a private man, and he loved reading his Daily Telegraph every morning.

'We have already been contacted by military veterans who are intending to come, even though they have never met him.

'Distant relation': Mr Percival was related to Spencer Perceval - the only British prime minister to be assassinated

'We've been told one group is looking to bring around 200 people to the service, which would be fantastic.'

Davis Boothman, secretary for the RAF Association Layland branch, said he would ring friends and colleagues in an effort to gain additional support.

He said: 'We normally do try and make a showing at these times.

'It is important that we remember people like Harold - they are part of us.'

Relative Mr Worsell is unable to attend the service, but his son - Mr Percival's great nephew - will represent the family.

Mr Worsell said: 'My uncle would be very surprised at the attention this seems to have received and the number of people wanting to attend.

'What with him being a very private person, forming long-term relationships didn't seem to be part of his make-up.

'He didn't really speak about his military career but he perhaps wished he didn't leave the RAF at the end of the war. But he was a free spirit.'

The service takes place at 11am on Monday, at Lytham Park Crematorium.
