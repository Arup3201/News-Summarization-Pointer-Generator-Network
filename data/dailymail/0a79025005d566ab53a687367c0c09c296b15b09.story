The Liberal Democrats have been given one of their biggest donations in history, it emerged today.

Former Cambridge professor George Watson, who once said he had disagreed with the party 'for decades, off and on', left £950,000 in his will.

It was the single biggest donation to any party in the last three months, and is the second largest amount ever given to the Nick Clegg's Lib Dems.

Mr Clegg, who posed for selfie at the Skills Show at the NEC in Birmingham, saw £2.75million flow into Lib Dem coffers from July to September

The Electoral Commission today published details of all donations to political parties from July to September.

The Tories received more than twice as much in donations as Labour in the third quarter of this year.

The Conservative Party reported donations totalling £6.76 million, while Labour's total was £3.19 million.

The Liberal Democrats reported £2.75 million, a third of which came from Professor Watson, who died last year aged 86.

Professor Watson's £950,000 donation is the largest given to the Lib Dems since the £2.4million cheque from Michael Brown, who was later convicted of fraud. 

He once stood for the Liberal Party in 1959 in Cheltenham and was senior treasurer of the Cambridge University Liberal Club from 1978 to 1992.

He was taught by Narnia novelist CS Lewis and went on to teach Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy author Douglas Adams.

Writing in the Times Higher Education in 2010, he gave a withering assessment of the Lib Dems 'Parties do not exact obedience, and to join is not to share responsibility for what they do or propose. I have been disagreeing with mine for decades, off and on. Not that anybody noticed.'

Lib Dem Cambridge MP Julian Huppert said: 'George Grimes Watson was a great thinker, an English don and a life-long liberal.'

In total, 11 political parties registered in Great Britain reported accepting a total of £14,927,083 in donations between July 1 and September 30

The Lib Dems also received £275,000 from Brompton Capital Limited, controlled by pizza entrepreneur Rumi Verjee.

Today's figures show the Conservatives received sizeable gifts including £500,000 from Addison Lee founder John Griffin.

There was also £300,000 from businessman and party co-treasurer Lord Farmer - who was awarded a peerage in September.

Labour frontbencher Jonathan Ashworth, shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: 'David Cameron's Tories are the party for a privileged few.

'The Tory election campaign will be funded by those who dine exclusively at the Prime Minister's top table and a select few in the hedge fund industry.

'David Cameron's hedge fund backers and millionaires have been given tax breaks while hard-working families are struggling to make ends meet.'

Labour accused David Cameron of relying on donations from welathy hedge funds, while the Tories said Ed Miliband was dependant on the trade unions for funding

Labour's biggest donation was £520,000 from the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw).

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said 69 per cent of donations to Labour under Ed Miliband had come from unions.

'These figures show union bosses are deploying their chequebooks to shore up Ed Miliband's faltering leadership,' he said.

'Len McCluskey and his fellow trade union barons are propping him up, because they get to pick the Labour candidates, choose the leader, and buy the policies.

'Ed Miliband's weakness would have serious consequences for Britain. He is too weak to cut the deficit, and too weak to fix the welfare system.

He would run up more debt than our children and grandchildren could ever hope to repay.'
