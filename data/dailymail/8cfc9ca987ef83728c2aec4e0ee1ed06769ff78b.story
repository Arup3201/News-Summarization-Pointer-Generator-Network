A once wheelchair bound mother-of-six says she has been given a whole new life after gastric bypass surgery has transformed both her health and fitness.Â 

Helen Jacobs-Grant, 42, from Medway, Kent, weighed 23 stone before going under the knife and felt life wasn't worth living at her heaviest.

She told the MailOnline: 'When I was overweight I just wanted to die, I was in pain all the time. However, I would never have commit suicide as I have to be a mother to my children. I just used to wish that I would go to sleep and never wake up.'

Transformed: Helen was unhappy and unhealthy at 23st, left, but has never felt better after shedding 11st, right

Helen, whose weightloss journey is featured in the first episode of the new Really TV show, Fat Surgeons, said she became a 'complete hermit' because of the pain and immobility her size caused.

'I didn't want to go anywhere so I 
became a complete hermit. When people came to the house I would hide as I
didn't want to be seen. I felt like a complete and utter freak,' she said.

When she did go out, pain from a hernia she had and the fact she was visually impaired meant she had to used a wheelchair to get around. She said it was 'soul destroying' not being able to go out with her older children or run around after her youngest, Harvey, six.

Helen was born with albinism to Anglo-Indian parents and she said this always made her feel different and low in confidence.

New lease of life: The mother-of-six used to live like a hermit but now goes running and to the gym regularly

She was often bullied and then became unhappily married age 20. She had three children, Joseph, 24, Lionel, 22 and Angelica, 16, with her first husband and her size gradually crept up.

When her marriage broke down she turned to comfort eating and then met her second husband, Mason, with whom she had another three children, Imogen, 13, Ivan, 12 and Harvey.

She suffered an abdominal injury when Harvey was born and a resulting hernia left her unable to even climb the stairs so she became 'trapped' in the living room of their family home - rarely able to even move off the sofa.

'If you'd have told me a year a go that I
would be running and doing Kung Fu I would have laughed my head off. 
I've completely transformed in every way'

She said she knew she had to 'tackle my demons' and do something to change her health before it was too late.

She said: 'I've either been having children or going
thorough emotional trauma and turned to eating for security. I've been 
like this my adult life and I want a new life.'

She began by eating a low fat, low carb diet and swimming twice a week. As a result she lost 7st but she still needed a wheelchair to get around and felt she couldn't lose anymore without help.

She said: 'I couldn't do any cardio exercise because the hernia was giving me so much pain and I had pelvic complications. A gastric bypass was my only hope and thankfully I was suitable for the treatment and booked into have surgery on New Year's Eve 2012.'

Surgeon Dr Shaw Somers carried out the procedure, fixing Helen's hernia before fitting the gastric band.

Since then she has lost another 4st - taking her to an 11st weight drop in total - and is now a dress size 12-14.

So long wheelchair: Helen no longer needs a mobility scooter to get around

Smiling again: Now Helen wants to help other people get healthy

She said she had never felt better. She no longer needs a wheelchair, is off disability benefits and has become a queen of fitness.

She said: 'Now I spring out of bed at 6am in the morning. I go running and to the gym. I've got my first belt in Kung Fu and do belly-dancing. I'm even planning to do the London Marathon in 2014.

'If you'd have told me a year a go that I would be running and doing Kung Fu I would have laughed my head off. I've completely transformed in every way.

'The surgeons haven't given me my life back because I never had an adult life as I've always been overweight and unable to do anything. They have given me a new beginning.'

Now Helen said she is 'truly living' for the first time in years and has never felt more confident.

She said: 'I feel adored for the first time because I finally love myself.'

Helen hopes her story can help other obese people find the drive to turn their lives around.

She said: 'If there is anyone overweight who feels trapped and like they can't go on living, they need to know there is help out there, you just have to ask. It's not easy but it is achievable. Speak to your GP and see what is available in your local community.'

Helen is now an advocate of healthy living and encourages her family to join her at the gym. She's also working as a volunteer with 'A Better Medway' - a council health initiative to support people in leading more active lifestyles - and is training to be employed in the health and fitness sector.
