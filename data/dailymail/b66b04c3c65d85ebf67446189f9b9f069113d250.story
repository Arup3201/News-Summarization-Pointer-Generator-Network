Many hope The Open will give us something to cheer after a dismal summer of British sport.

And if you are watching Lee Westwood and team wishing you could experience life as a professional golfer a UK company has the answer to your dreams.

A 100-day trip has been launched, taking in all the top courses featured in the European Tour, with luxury accommodation and private jet travel included - but it costs a whopping £250,000.

But if you want to reduce the cost of what is the most expensive golf trip in the world, you can slum it on commercial flights - albeit in first class - and pay 'just' £62,000 per person.

The trip, which is based on four people travelling together, takes in a spectacular 26 different countries, so the group can take on every fairway featured in last season's European Tour, including this year’s Open Championship venue Hoylake at the Royal Liverpool Golf Course.

While named the European Tour, the event actually dots all around the world, taking in venues in destinations ranging from South Africa and the Middle East to India, the Far East, Australia and the USA.

A spokesperson from Holidays Please, which is offering the exclusive trip, said: ‘If you've ever dreamed of following the same path as the greats of golf then this is the holiday for you. 

‘This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to create your very own piece of golf history.’
