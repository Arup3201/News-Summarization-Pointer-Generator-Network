Excitement continues to build with the Premier League season beginning on August 16... and that means you have just two weeks to finalise your MailOnline Fantasy Football team.

With a £100million budget you may think the options are unlimited, but that cash needs to fund the purchase of 14 players so a bargain or two can go a long way.

Here, Sportsmail give their recommendations on three must-have players for the spine of your team - Premier League powerhouses Tim Howard, John Terry and Yaya Toure. 

Fantasy: Sportsmail gives you the lowdown on three must-haves if you want to walk away with the title

Tim Howard (goalkeeper, Everton) - Value £5.4m

Howard excelled at the World Cup for the USA and he is likely to transfer that form to the Premier League for Roberto Martinez's side.

At £5.4m Howard is a snip compared to Joe Hart (£6.0m) and Petr Cech (£5.8m) and his points return is likely to be extremely similar.

Everton kept an impressive 15 clean sheets last season and Howard made some splendid saves, giving him an even greater return of points.

A good side is built on a solid base with an exceptional goalkeeper and Howard fits the bill. He plays in a settled side and, at 35, is showing no signs of ageing.

He made a World Cup record 16 saves in just one match in Brazil - if he was to do that in the Premier League then his points tally would rocket! 

Stopper: Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard is a perfect choice in goal at £5.4m due to his side's tight defence

You shall not pass: Howard made a World Cup record 16 saves against Belgium in Brazil, racking up the points

Blank: Everton kept 15 clean sheets last season, allowing Howard to accumulate lots of points

John Terry (defender, Chelsea) - Value £6.8m

If there is one thing Jose Mourinho is renowned for it is getting results based on clean sheets, and the Portuguese trusts his main lieutenant John Terry to provide them.

The £6.8m price-tag is expensive for a defender but that is because you are signing the creme de la creme.

Chelsea kept 16 clean sheets last season and Terry played on 34 occasions, meaning he brought in plenty of points.

What's more, Terry scored three goals last season and he has already netted the same number in pre-season this year - so he can even contribute a bit going forward. He has an eye for goal at the minute so it could prove wise to capitalise on that while you can.

The 33-year-old will be at the centre of Mourinho's title charge this season, meaning the points Terry provides really could end with prizes...

Attacking? The defender also popped up with three goals, and has scored three already in pre-season

Yaya Toure (midfielder, Manchester City) - Value £11.0m

He may be the most expensive midfielder on the game, but there's a perfectly good reason for that - Toure absolutely guarantees you points.

The Ivorian scored an incredible 20 goals from midfield last season, making him worth his weight in gold.

It's like having another striker!

The 31-year-old also provided nine assists and kept 15 clean sheets, meaning he just racks up the points. He would be an ideal pick for captain as well, because he benefits from both scoring goals and gaining from Manchester City keeping clean sheets.

What's more Toure barely misses a game - and for a team who won the title last season, he will continue to provide assists and find the back of the net. Man-of-the-match awards will also come in abundance for City's star man.

He had an unsettled summer and will come back with a point to prove - he is the number one must-have pick. 

Pricey but worth it: Manchester City's Yaya Toure will set you back £11m but he will guarantee you points
