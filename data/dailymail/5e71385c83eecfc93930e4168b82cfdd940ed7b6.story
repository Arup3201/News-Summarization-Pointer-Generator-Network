Matthew Scheidt, 18, was arrested for posing as a cop

A serial imposter, who once posed as a nurse to perform CPR on a man having an heart attack, has been arrested again - this time for impersonating a police officer. 

Matthew Scheidt, 18, was charged with carrying a concealed firearm and posing as an officer after telling an undercover cop to 'buckle up' in Miami Beach.

At the time of his arrest, the teen is alleged to have had several police items including an Osceola County sheriff's badge, deputies' T-shirts, a handgun, stun gun, handcuffs, a police radio and an ankle holster, according to records.

He also had a laptop computer mounted on
his car dashboard as well as 'takedown lights' used by officers in 
unmarked cars, reports the Orlando Sentinel.

The undercover detective claims he had asked Scheidt if he was a police officer after the teenager told him to put on his seat belt.

Scheidt allegedly said he was twice and the undercover detective informed him that someone had offered to sell him drugs, Scheidt promised to follow the tip up, according to the records.

The Miami Beach officer became suspicious as he did not recognize Scheidt and called for back-up, reports the Sentinel.

The teen - who previously is accused of conning Kissimmee hospital workers into letting him treat a patient in cardiac arrest - has a history of impersonating medical staff and police dating back to when he was just 13.

In August, Scheidt, then 17, allegedly persuaded Osceola Regional Medical Center employees to issue him a badge for a physician assistant and used it to work in the hospital's emergency room for several days, records allege.

At the time, Scheidt worked for a doctors' office in Kissimmee and had been issued a valid ID for limited areas of the hospital.

St. Cloud Regional Medical Center also caught him pretending to be a nurse in 2007, just before he turned 14, records show.

The Osceola County Sheriff's Office is also charging the teen with grand theft after it emerged the police radio he is accused of having belonged to the force.

Sheriff's spokeswoman Twis Lizasuain told the Sentinel that the badge Scheidt was carrying also looked like an agency badge but was not.

All of the items seized from the teen will be examined to determine whether they were stolen from the police.

Scheidt is already awaiting trial in Osceola on two counts of impersonating a physician assistant and four counts of practicing medicine without a license.

His next court appearance in the Kissimmee case is March 6, according to the Orange-Osceola State Attorney's Office.

Despite his being 17 at the time, prosecutors chose to indict him as an adult because of the severity of his accused acts., reports the Sentinel.
