Model Poppy Delevingne was joined by a host of her showbiz pals as she tied the knot to long-term partner James Cook today.

The bride wore an unusual white custom-made Chanel gown which looked like a lacy, mini dress with sheer fabric attached to make it full-length. Sticking with tradition, she wore a veil in her blonde, curled hair.

After getting ready at Claridge's Hotel in London's Mayfair, she was helped into a car to be taken to her nearby church venue by her supermodel sister, Cara, who also wore a white Chanel gown.

Spice Girl Geri Halliwell and TV

Paul's Church, Knightsbridge, London, this afternoon.

Earlier
 this week, Sebastian Shakespeare revealed in the Daily Mail that the 
27-year-old had selected 17 bridesmaids to join her walk up the aisle.

Her
 sisters Cara, 21, and Chloe, 29, were undoubtedly among them, as well 
as a number of little girls who arrived in pretty white dresses with 
pale blue sashes and flowers in their hair.

There were also a number of page boys dressed in white and blue and one little boy who appeared to be dressed as a teddy bear.

Although the bridal party wore white or blue, Geri also appeared to be in bridesmaid attire in her choice of a long, sleevesless gown in a shade of pastel pink.

Trinny wore a different style dress in the same pink shade.

The
 groom, wearing a bespoke morning suit by Oliver Brown  beamed on the church steps as he posed for photographers before

Poppy has reportedly banned guests from posting pictures on social media as glossy magazine Porter is said to have secured exclusive coverage of the wedding, on which it seems no expense has been spared.

Pink ladies: Trinny Woodall, left, and Geri Halliwell wore a similar shade

James, who works for his family's aerospace company, proposed in October 2012 with a bespoke jewellery box by Anya Hindmarch. It contained an engagement ring alongside pictures of the couple and the words 'will you marry me?' embossed in gold.

Poppy has had three different 
elaborate hen parties around the globe with her celebrity friends 
including Rosie Huntingdon-Whiteley and Sienna Miller.

The
 bride's blue blood parents, who live in Chelsea, can certainly afford 
to foot the bill.

Poppy's grandfather is the former English Heritage 
chairman Sir Jocelyn Stevens, founder of the 1960s pirate radio station 
Radio Caroline.

Meanwhile
 her father Charles, a property-developer, had a grandfather who was a 
politician (Hamar, 1st Viscount Greenwood) and his aunt, Doris 
Delevingne, was a society beauty who was friends with Winston Churchill.

Her mother, Pandora, is one of the Duchess of York's best friends and 
her grandmother was a lady-in-waiting for Princess Margaret.

Special effort: The guests looked incredible stylish in their formal attire

The venue: St Paul's Church in Knightsbridge

With her parent's social standing, Poppy and her sisters became accustomed to rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous from a young age.

Joan Collins is Cara's godmother while their mother's friendship with Sarah Ferguson meant they also became close to Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.

Poppy was privately educated before finding success as a fashion model. She has starred in campaigns for Anya Hindmarch, Agent Provocateur, Diesel, Chanel and Louis Vuitton - although more recently her fame has been eclipsed by that of her sister.
