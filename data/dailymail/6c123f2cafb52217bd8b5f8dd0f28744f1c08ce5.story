A Colorado woman who suffered from breast cancer died after injecting her tumor with an alternative therapy.

The 61-year-old had been taking cesium supplements every day for a year.

But it was her decision to crush up an oral tablet and inject it into her breast that led to her death.

Tragic: A Colorado woman died after injecting her breast tumor with cesium as an alternative cancer therapy

Dangerous: The unnamed 61-year-old had been taking cesium pills, which are widely available in stores, for years. She died after injecting it into her tumor for the first time

New of the cause of the unnamed woman's death came in a new case study, reported Live Science on Tuesday.

Cesium has been touted as a cancer therapy by alternative medicine proponents for years.

Advocates of the treatment believe the cesium can increase the pH of acidic cancer cells, thereby slowing their growth.

While the supplement may be readily purchased in health food stores, it is not without its risks.

What's more, there is no scientific evidence that supports claims that cesium can treat cancer.

After the woman and her husband injected the cesium into her breast, things took a tragic turn.

'Not long after, she started to feel sick,'Daniel Sessions, a toxicologist who treated the woman in Denver, told ABC News.'After a few hours, she went into cardiac arrest in front of her family and was rushed to the hospital.'

The woman lost conciousness and never regained it. She was dead in ten days.

According to Sessions, heart problems are a common effect seen in cesium use.

The woman had taken the cesium at the suggestion of a nutritionist after refusing a biopsy on the tumor a year before her death.

In addition to the high levels of cesium found in her system, the woman's death may have also been hastened by the advanced stage breast cancer, which had spread to her lymph nodes.

While Sessions believes alternative therapies have a place in medicine, he warned that those products 'should not be thought of as benign or harmless.'

Lesson: Physicians authored a study after her death to illustrate the possible dangers of treating oneself with alternative therapies
