Everton may be struggling domestically this season, but that hasn't stopped Roberto Martinez's side gaining an unlikely fan in global pop star Justin Bieber.

The 20-year-old took to Twitter on Saturday evening to upload pictures of himself playing football in the Toffees' white and purple third kit.

Captioned with 'Great times', the Canadian uploaded three images in the strip after having taken part in a tournament held on an island in Turks and Caicos on Friday afternoon.

The Parrot Cay resort island is believed to be owned by Everton director Robert Earl - who co-founded restaurant chain Planet Hollywood.

Bieber's public followers are known as 'Beliebers' and belief is something the Toffees are in desperate need of following a wretched run of form.

The Bluenoses have plummeted to 13th in the Premier League table with 21 points after losing five of their last six games.

Speaking after their 2-0 defeat at Hull City on New Year's Day, Martinez acknowledged something is missing from his side who finished fifth last season.

'It is a tough period but the reality is that the second half of the season is an opportunity to get back our swagger and our enjoyment and get a positive result really quickly,' he said.

'Now is the time to find solutions internally and I need to bring the enjoyment back to my players on the pitch. That's the only concern that I have and I will do that with all my energy.

'We need to get back to finding that training is a real opportunity to show you can play for the team and show a real togetherness as a football club.

'Unfortunately when you are in this moment of difficulty, any change could affect us and punish us. That's the reality.'

Martinez, whose stock was higher than ever last term, is now facing questions about his future at Goodison Park but with things not yet at crisis point he is firmly focused on the task at hand.

'If I had time to think about all those aspects, I wouldn't do my job,' he added.

'I welcome that pressure, I know the team that I have has quality. We are far away from the levels of quality we have in our play.

'It's for us to start a new year, a fresh year and quickly turn things around. It's the time to start finding solutions.'

The 41-year-old will be hoping that begins on Tuesday night when Everton host West Ham in the FA Cup third round.
