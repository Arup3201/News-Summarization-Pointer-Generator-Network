Former Watford boss Billy McKinlay admitted he was 'disappointed' and 'surprised' to lose his job after just eight days in charge at Vicarage Road.

The 45-year-old replaced Oscar Garcia as head coach at the end of September and opened his account with a 2-1 victory over Brentford before drawing with Brighton last weekend.

But McKinlay, who resigned from his role as Northern Ireland's assistant manager in order to concentrate on Watford, lasted only eight days, with Slavisa Jokanovic appointed as his successor last week.

The former Dundee United midfielder told Sky Sports: 'I was disappointed.

'I was surprised to be appointed in the first place, but for it to only last as short as it did was a surprise to say the least.'

When asked whether he would be returning to his role as Michael O'Neill's assistant, McKinlay said: 'That is something for another time.'
