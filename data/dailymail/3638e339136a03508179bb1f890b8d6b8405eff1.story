Andrew Chamberlain, 50, was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm and jailed for three years

A charity worker who broke his neighbour’s arm in three places with a four foot scaffolding pole during a row over a parking space has been jailed.

Andrew Chamberlain, 50, became ‘abusive and threatening’ after 24-year-old Daniel Morgan parked outside his home on the terraced street in Blackwood, South Wales.

The carer, who has 42 previous convictions including an offence of making a threat to kill in 2004, was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and jailed for three years on Friday.

A jury at Cardiff Crown Court was told an argument erupted and Chamberlain took a large metal pole from his garden, raised it above his head and struck Mr Morgan - who blocked the blow with arm.

Mr Morgan said: ‘It made a hell of a thud – the pain was excruciating.

‘He then brought the bar back as if he was going to hit me again.’

But Chamberlain claimed in an earlier hearing that he had been threatened by Mr Morgan and was using the pole to defend himself.

He also said he needed regular access to the house where he lives with his 82-year-old mother because she suffers from severe arthritis and he needed to assist her.

Mr Morgan said there were no official parking restrictions in the street but he would not have parked there if he’s known about Chamberlain’s mother’s health problems.

The court heard parking was a 'contentious issue' on the street and residents had agreed to only park outside their own homes in Greenfield Terrace.

Chamberlain has a string of convictions including aiming an air pistol at a woman’s head and threatening to shoot her, for which he was jailed for three and a half years.

James Evans, defending, said he had ‘turned his life around’ and was a volunteer worker for a charity.

Recorder Peter Griffiths told Chamberlain: ‘It is no pleasure for me to do the duty I have to perform.

‘You have turned your life around in the past 10 years. I was immensely impressed by the testimonials submitted in your behalf.’

The judge said despite the fact he is a carer for his mother he had to follow sentencing guidelines and an immediate custodial sentence was inevitable.
