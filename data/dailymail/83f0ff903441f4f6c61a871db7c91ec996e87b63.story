Twins Amelia and Allison Tucker look like any other toddlers their age as they laugh, play - and do their best to keep their parents on their toes.

But a little over a year ago, the scene could not look more different - as the girls were born conjoined at the chest and abdomen and anxiously awaiting a complicated separation surgery.

Now nearly 14 months since the twins - who will turn two in March - were successfully separated, their parents have revealed that they are happy, healthy and active toddlers.

'Seeing the girls and seeing them 
climb and get in to things - as aggravated as I get I can't help but 
laugh because they're an absolute miracle,' their mother Shellie told Good Morning America.

The
 girls were born to Shellie and her husband Greg, from Adams, New York, 
despite a doctor initially recommending the expectant parents abort the 
girls after a scan showed they were conjoined.

'As
 he was telling me, I could literally feel the girls kicking in my belly
 and I knew that that wasnâ€™t something possible,' Shellie said.

The
 Tuckers, who already had a young son, sought a second opinion at Childrenâ€™s
 Hospital of Philadelphia, where doctors said that the girls could be 
separated when they were born.

After the birth, the family lived full time at the hospital as the twins prepared for surgery.

An incredible 
X-ray showed the daunting task doctors had ahead of them, with the girls
 joined at a significant portion of their fronts. They shared a chest wall, diaphragm, 
pericardium and liver.

Then
 on November 7 last year, a team of 40 doctors and nurses successfully 
carried out the seven-hour surgery to separate Allison and Amelia.

After the separation, Shellie wrote on her blog:
 'Greg and I are thrilled that our daughters have been given this 
remarkable gift by the amazing team from The Childrenâ€™s Hospital of 
Philadelphia.

'We are so 
grateful for the support and encouragement that the medical team, our 
families and our friends have given us during this long journey.'

Because they didn't share a lot of internal organs, the prognosis for the twins was very positive.

'Seeing them for the first time as two separate girls was really the most amazing feeling,' Greg Tucker told GMA.

Footage of the girls now shows them as two very individual personalities as they push each other in strollers, play with a mini basketball hoop or share snacks together.

'I'm thankful for every single day,' their mother added. 'I can't describe it.'

The surgery was the 21st separation 
of conjoined twins performed at the hospital. The procedure involved 
about 40 medical staff members.

Conjoined twins occur once in every 
50,000 to 60,000 births, and most are stillborn. About three-quarters of
 such twins are female and are joined at least partially in the chest, 
sharing organs.

Challenge: Around 40 medical staff worked for seven hours to separate the girls - after practicing on dolls

Success! The girls had a good prognosis as they did not share any major organs; they have now recovered

Chances of successful surgery and survival are greater if the twins have separate sets of organs, the hospital said.

Two years ago, conjoined 20-month-old twins from the Dominican Republic were separated at a Virginia hospital.

Maria
 and Teresa Tapia were attached at the lower chest, and surgical teams 
successfully divided their liver, pancreas and other shared organ 
systems and reconstructed their abdominal walls.

A
 few days before that, 2-year-old twin sisters Angelica and Angelina 
Sabuco from San Jose, California, who were joined at the chest and 
abdomen, were separated in procedures performed at a California 
hospital.
