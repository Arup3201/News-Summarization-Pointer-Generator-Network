It could have been a scene from a new film called The Umpire Strikes Back – but the stormtroopers that gathered at Chase Field on Sunday were actually fans and staff dressing up for the Arizona Diamondbacks’ Star Wars Day.

Somewhere in amongst the costume camaraderie, there was a game of baseball against the Chicago Cubs, which The Diamondbacks eventually won 3-2.

The enthusiasm for the Star Wars theme was such that even Fox Sports commentators Steve Berthiaume and Bob Brenly dressed up – as a stormtrooper and heroic Wookie Chewbacca.

The costumes were incredibly realistic and were almost movie-set standard.

The game began with the umpire crew, led by Doug Eddings, being given a guard of honour by stormtroopers.

The re-enactors, along with other characters, then walked the perimeter and got high-fives from the fans.

Photographs from the event emerged as Episode VII director J J Abrams revealed what his X-Wing starfighter will look like.

The director was pictured next to the fighter as he promoted his Star Wars: Force For Change Unicef funderaiser.

Those donating to it are in with a chance of getting a small part in the much-anticipated sequel.
