Slapping a 20 per cent tax on soft drinks would cut the number of fat Britons by more than a quarter of a million, claim experts.

Researchers say a price hike would drive down sales of the sugary beverages and therefore benefit the nation’s health.

A new study claims a 20 per cent tax on sugar-sweetened drinks would reduce the number of adults who are obese or overweight by 285,000.

Wide load: Slapping a 20 per cent tax on soft drinks would cut the number of fat Britons by more than a quarter of a million, claims a new report by experts from a range of groups including Oxford and Reading universities

The tax would raise £276million a year to help the NHS cope with the burden of obesity-related illnesses, says the report.

People aged 16 to 30 would be most affected as they are the highest consumers of soft drinks.

There have been growing calls for a tax on soft drinks with high sugar content as a way of cutting the rise in obesity, diabetes and tooth decay.

Researchers said the tax ‘is predicted to reduce the number of people in the UK who are obese by 1.3 per cent or 180,000 people, and the number who are overweight or obese by 0.9 per cent or 285,000 people’.

The overall fall in the number of overweight and obese people would be 2.2 per cent, says the study published on Bmj.com.

The report, which was carried out by researchers at the British Heart Foundation, Health Promotion Research Group at the University of Oxford and the Centre for Food Security at the University of Reading, estimates that a sugar tax would put 12p on a 330ml can bought in a supermarket.

A typical soft drink contains between six and 15 teaspoons of sugar, with one teaspoon containing 16 calories.

The
price of a 500ml bottle of Coca-Cola, which contains 210 calories and 
14 teaspoons of sugar, would rise from £1.15 to £1.38.

And 500ml of Ribena, which has 13 teaspoons of sugar, would jump from £1.18 to £1.42.

In an accompanying editorial for Bmj, Jason Block, assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, backed a proposal by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges for Britain to pilot the effects of a one year 20 per cent tax on soft drinks.

Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the BHF, which helped fund the study, said: ‘Guzzling fizzy drinks is now the daily norm for around 40 per cent of 13-year-olds.

'The effects on young people’s health are a major concern.

‘This research suggests that a health-related food duty, alongside other measures such as the new front of pack food labelling scheme, could be an effective way – particularly in young people – to help reduce obesity.’

However, critics dismissed the tax proposal, saying it would only affect a minority of the population.

Catherine Collins, Principal Dietitian at St George’s Hospital NHS Trust, said the tax might have a marginal effect on ‘cola addicts’.

She added: ‘For the rest of us, sadly, this approach would have very little impact on adult weight management.

'Why? Because government data shows the incidence of obesity rises with increasing age, peaking in the 45-74 age group.’

Tom Sanders, professor of nutrition and dietetics, School of Medicine, King’s College London, said it was ‘very naive’ to think tax could so easily manipulate calorie intake.

‘The cost of sugar-sweetened beverages is currently so low that any price increase would be so marginal that it would be unlikely to affect intake,’ he said.

‘You can buy 3 litres of orange squash (28 per cent sugar) for £1 in discount stores.’
