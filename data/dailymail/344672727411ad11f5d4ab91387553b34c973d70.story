They are a staple on restaurant tables across the country, but the EU has decided to ban olive oil jugs in order to ‘protect customers’.

The controversial move means that customers will now only be able dip their bread or garnish their food using oil from non-refillable and labelled bottles.

A decision to ban the classic jugs and dipping bowls was made by a little-known Brussels committee earlier this week.

Outlawed: From January 2014 restaurants will have to serve oil from pre-packaged factory bottles with tamper-proof nozzles and labelling in line with EU industrial standards

They will be outlawed across Europe from the start of next year, with restaurants ordered to use oil from pre-packaged factory bottles complete with tamperproof lids.

But restaurateurs have criticised the authoritarian measure taken by the European Commission – the EU’s executive.

The body said it no plans to impose similar restrictions on packaging for butter, salt, pepper and other dinner table essentials.

The Commission said that a majority of the EU’s member states had backed the move, which has already been compulsory in Portugal since 2006, and will benefit producers in struggling nations such as Spain and Greece.

The move was justified to improve hygiene and improve the ‘image of olive oil’, with the EU suggesting that many customers are often tricked by cheaper alternatives to olive oil.

EU spokesman Olivier Bailly said: ‘We are just protecting consumers. We are just making clear that when you want to have olive oil of a certain quality in a restaurant you get exactly the one you are paying for.’

Another official said: ‘This is to guarantee the quality and authenticity of the olive oil put at the disposal of consumers. The aim is to better inform and protect consumer. We also expect hygiene to be improved too.

‘Customers aren’t stupid - they would be the first to know if someone was being dishonest.’

Up to 70 per cent of the world’s olive oil is produced in the European Union but officials also fear that the product is the subject of widespread fraud.

Cheaper produce is often passed as off as higher quality oil from some of Europe’s most renowned growing regions.

British officials abstained from the vote, made using Common Agriculture Policy regulations, on Tuesday.

The move to ban the jugs and serving dishes will be enforced by local authority food inspections of restaurants in the UK.

Sam Clark, chef and owner of London’s award-winning Moro, criticised the decision, saying: ‘This will affect us. It is about choice and freedom of choice. We buy our oil, which we have selected from a farm in Spain, to serve our customers.’

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, MEP Martin Callanan said: ‘Is it April 1st? With the euro crisis, a collapse in confidence in the EU, and a faltering economy surely the commission has more important things to worry about than banning refillable olive oil bottles?

‘They should be seeking to reduce unnecessary packaging.’
