Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal has rubbished speculation linking him with a move to Manchester United. 

The Chilean was strongly linked with a transfer from the Italian champions, with Louis van Gaal's new-look Red Devils mooted as a potential destination.

Real Madrid were also said to be interested but the 27-year-old insists he was only concentrating on recovering from a knee injury and plans to stay in Turin for the foreseeable future.

The Chilean midfielder insists he was only focused on recovering from a knee injury last summer 

Vidal told Italian newspaper Tuttosport: 'The truth is I was calm and relaxed this summer, only focusing on my knee. 

'I never once asked my agent or Juventus if something was happening.

'I have a pact with my agent: if there is something concrete, he alerts me. He did not alert me.'

Speaking ahead of Juventus' top of the table clash with Roma on Sunday, Vidal would not be drawn on whether he would have moved to Old Trafford had the opportunity arose.

The former Bayer Leverkusen star featured for Chile in the World Cup but a knee problem limited his impact in Brazil.  

He added: 'I really don't know. All I can say is I'm happy in Turin, my wife loves Turin and the little ones are happy here. 

'My family's happiness is more important than anything else.'
