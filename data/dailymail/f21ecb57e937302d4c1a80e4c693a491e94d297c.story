Drivers who use smartphone apps for directions as a cheaper method than costly sat-nav systems could soon find themselves at odds with government guidelines.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) wants to regulate navigation aids of all kinds in cars including those that can be used on phones with a set of voluntary guidelines.

Apps, like Google Maps, Apple Maps or Waze, are a grey area when it comes to varying state laws banning the use of making calls or texting on cellphones while driving.

The Department of Transport is proposing a set of guidelines to curb the use of distracting apps, including those which cause directions, on smartphones but sources question whether they will be effective

As part of the Grow America Act announced last month, the Obama administration laid out plans to increase safety across all modes of transport.

The measures would specify that authorities can restrict the use of apps - and bring in stricter rules - if they seem dangerous.

The voluntary guidelines for built-in navigational systems in cars are supported by the car industry, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration told MailOnline today.

However it remains to be seen whether Silicon Valley will work with DOT over proposed voluntary guidelines on software such as map apps that could cause distractions. 

In a statement today, DOT said: 'In 2013, the Department of Transportation's
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration addressed built-in devices as
part of its voluntary Distracted Driving Guidelines and is currently in the
process of developing additional guidelines to address hand held devices, which
will be out for public comment later this year.

'Distracted driving is a deadly
epidemic that has devastating consequences on our nation’s roadways, taking
thousands of lives each year. Safety is our top priority and we’re working
to address all forms of distraction to reduce the amount of deaths and ensure
drivers keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel.'

Critics claim that it will be too difficult for the government to keep up with - and keep track of -  the stream of new technology emerging from Silicon Valley.

Catherine
 McCullough, from the Intelligent Car Coalition, a non-profit 
organization which represents the interests of the transportation and 
technology industries, told The New York Times: 'They don’t have the 
budget or the structure to oversee both Silicon Valley and the auto 
industry.'

Whether drivers can be criminally charged for using maps on their smartphones remains unclear.

The Times provided an example of a California driver who was issued a $165 ticket for using a map on his iPhone - the decision was later reversed by a judge.

Each day in the U.S., nine people are killed and 1,060 people are injured in crashes that are reported to involve a distracted driver.

DOT laid out voluntary guidelines for the
 car industry last year which said sat-navs should not take more than 
two seconds for a single interaction - the time it takes a car at 60mph 
to travel half the length of a football field.

Google refused to comment after being contacted by MailOnline on Tuesday. Attempts to reach Apple, another of the biggest providers of smartphone 
map apps, proved unsuccessful.

Satellite navigational devices are already regulated by the federal government with the support of the auto industry
