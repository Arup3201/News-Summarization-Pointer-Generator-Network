For a man who doesn't smoke, Jack Wilshere has developed an unfortunate habit of falling onto cigarettes and pipes.

Three times now he has either been pictured fag in mouth or shisha pipe in hand. That’s a decent number for a player who, after (unlucky) strike one in 2013, said: ‘I made a mistake. Players make mistakes. I'm not a smoker.’

Around the time he also tweeted a picture of Zinedine Zidane having a cigarette. On that logic, he could have also referenced Cruyff, Maradona, Ashley Cole, Wayne Rooney or Mesut Ozil.

Jack Wilshere has once again made the headlines for the wrong reasons. When is he going to realise his place in the Arsenal team is under serious threat and start acting like a professional? Robert B, Fife

Surely it’s time to start educating Jack and have somebody explain to him how to behave. If he was smoking that pipe, even if it doesn’t do him any serious damage as a player I wouldn’t put myself in that position. The goalkeeper has already lost his place over a smoking issue so you would never dream of being seen with anything – cigarette, shisha, lager, anything. Being in the team means so much to you and is such a reward for your efforts that it’s not worth that risk. He is obviously going out and thinks he is in a private situation but you never are as a footballer, there is always somebody on the lookout. You have to be squeaky clean and if you are serious about your football that’s how you should want to live anyway.

Good company and good puffers, but he might start to feel left out when the smoke clears and he sees how many medals they have each won.

With Wilshere, that might always be the cliched punchline. At 23, his solitary FA Cup winner’s medal doesn't seem quite enough. In a team game it would be wrong to draw too much from that statistic.

But what, then, to make of his talent when set against the staggering potential? Has one of England’s great young prospects become one of England’s great players? How much serious interest is there among title-contending clubs around Europe to sign him?

It’s been almost a year since Paul Scholes said: 'Jack Wilshere, he came on the scene and what a top player he looked, but he’s never really gone on. He needs people like [Patrick] Vieira to take him to the next level. His development, he doesn’t look any better now than he did at 17.’

Wilshere has not played since Novemeber after picking up an injury against Manchester United

Wilshere stepped up his return from injury and was pictured at Arsenal's training ground with Robert Pires

Wilshere made contact with Scholes after that and, after a bit of good form for club and country, Scholes backtracked. In October, the former Manchester United midfielder said ‘the penny has dropped’ for Wilshere.

And yet it hasn't. Certainly not when it comes to smoking. And as a player has he really turned a corner? There will always be spectacular moments that make you think so. His performance in the 2-2 draw with Manchester City in September was simply sublime.

But his talent has never been in doubt. Everyone knows he has brilliant physical gifts and a mind that knows how to work them. He is a unique talent. The ambiguity comes over his ability to sustain any kind of form and with that comes his never-ending challenge of staying injury free. The rent-a-quotes have had a good run in explaining that smoking will hardly accelerate a return from injury.

That much is obvious, regardless of how many successful sportsmen have an occasional cigarette, and regardless of how little damage a sporadic cigarette might do. But the point remains, smoking is something smokers of all levels of dedication try to get away with. It is not something that will enhance anyone physically. If there is an affect from smoking, the scientists and doctors of this world are really rather confident about which way it goes.

Wilshere has won 26 caps for England - but could have won far more had he not suffered so many injuries

For Wilshere, once more an injured athlete, surely now is the time to maximise his chances of good health. Surely the onus should be on returning quickly from his latest ankle problem, this one having kept him out since November 22. Surely, the desire to make up for lost time in a stop-start career must be overwhelming by now.

Those are the assumptions, anyway.

His frustrations and disappointments at his injuries – 84 appearances in four seasons since his breakthrough in 2010-11 is simply not enough – must be incomprehensible to anyone beyond the man himself. But aside from pontifications such as this and the many others that accompany this sort of subject, his employers have already been clear on the subject.

Johan Cruyff and Wayne Rooney are two players who have smoked in their career

This was Arsene Wenger in response to the 2013 incident: ‘I disagree completely with that behaviour. I don't know really what happened, so I will need to have a chat with him about that.’

This was Wenger in 2014, after Wilshere’s post-World Cup cigar: ‘I haven’t spoken to him so it’s very difficult for me to make any statement. I know what you can make of the pictures.

‘I have to speak to him before I come out publicly. We will speak this week. I am not deeply concerned by it but I just want to know what happened.’

Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was caught smoking on New Year's day - and is now out of the team

Quite aside from the thought that Wenger’s hairdryer is not enough to extinguish a cigarette – Wojciech Szczesny felt comfortable enough lighting up in the shower on New Year’s Day, even though he has since been left on the sidelines – Wilshere is plainly ignoring advice from his manager.

He will doubtless offer contrite words. But it shouldn’t be about whether he is sorry or not. It should be about a realisation that his career is ticking away and it might not be a tremendously good idea to stand in front of a camera with a pipe.
