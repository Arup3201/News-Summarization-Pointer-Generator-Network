They've been married since 1966 but Phil Robertson has only just bought his wife Kay a wedding ring. The under-fire Duck Dynasty star splashed out on a diamond sparkler for his long suffering wife this Christmas and granddaughter Sadie Robertson shared a picture of the happy couple on Twitter. 

'After 50 years of marriage, Papaw Phil finally gave Mamaw Kay a wedding ring for Christmas (sic)', Sadie wrote.

Robertson provoked outrage when homophobic comments he made in an interview with GQ magazine were made public two weeks ago.

He was quoted as saying: 'It seems like, to me, a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man’s anus.

She only had to wait 50 years: Phil Robertson bought his wife Kay a wedding ring for Christmas, even though the couple married in 1966

'That’s just me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She’s got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I’m saying? But hey, sin: It’s not logical, my man. It’s just not logical.'

Comparisons he made between homosexuality and bestiality also caused offense.

'Everything is blurred on what’s right and what’s wrong… Sin becomes fine. Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there... Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men.'

The 67-year-old has faced condemnation from some corners, but his supporters have rallied around the embattled reality TV star, saying he has a right to free speech.

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Robertson refused to back down from his controversial comments, saying that 'sexual immorality' is the 'number one' sinful act.

'I have made hundreds and hundreds of speeches and you can pick them apart and the center has always been Jesus Christ.

Running around: 'Miss Kay' has said her husband of more than four decades Phil Robertson, whose homophobic comments have raised ire recently, used to cheat on her with other women

‘Do many people get up and walk out? Yeah, all the time, do I hold it against them? No. Anybody can get up and stop listening. We are all just humans on this planet.’

His family and local community have come to his defense and stood firmly behind him, and the family's $400 million empire doesn't seem in any danger of collapsing.

Despite the patriarch being put on an indefinite hiatus by network A&E, the family's merchandise has been reinstated by Cracker Barrel after fans complained about its removal from shelves.

In a picture of the couple taken yesterday, Kay perches on the sofa wearing a Christmas jumper, huge 
smile and the large diamond rock, while her 
husband reclines on the sofa pointing at the ring.

While they are happily married now, Phil and Miss Kay, as his wife is known, have previously opened up about their pre-fame struggles with Robertson's alcohol problems and adultery.

In the documentary The Robertsons, she said: 'The drinking got worse. And I knew then, but I didn't want to believe it - he was running around on me.

'And what I would tell my boys all the time is, “That's not your daddy. That's the devil in your daddy.”  I’ve been fighting for this marriage for a long time.'

Despite his past, Robertson appears to have no qualms with moralizing about other people's lifestyles.

He came under fire from gay rights group GLAAD after making the homophobic comments in the January 2014 issue of GQ magazine and Duck Dynasty show bosses have put him on indefinite hiatus.

Robertson, who claims to be devoutly Christian, then grouped homosexuals in with terrorists and prostitutes in a paraphrased Bible quote.

He said: 'Don’t be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers - they won’t inherit the kingdom of God. Don’t deceive yourself. It’s not right.'

GLAAD hit back soon after the interview was released online, calling him a ‘stain’ on the network A&E which airs the show.

Despite being put on suspension by the network, Phil has stood by his statements and his family have defended him - saying they wouldn't continue to film the show if their patriarch wasn't involved.

MailOnline was given exclusive access to a bible study meeting held last Sunday at the family's church in West Monroe, Louisiana. At the meeting, Robertson spoke out about the criticism, saying: 'I will not give or back off my path'.

At the small gathering, Robertson gave a speech going so far as to say that Jesus could save gay people.

'I love all men and women. I am a lover of humanity, not a hater,' he said.

Robertson addressed White's Ferry Road Church 
wearing his full camouflage suit for around 45 
minutes.

He said: ‘I have 
been immoral, drunk, high. I ran with the wicked people for 28 years and
 I have run with the Jesus people since and the contrast is astounding. I tell people, "You are a sinner, we all are. Do you want to hear my story before I give you the bottom line on your story?"

‘We
 murder each other and we steal from one another, sex and immorality 
goes ballistic. All the diseases that just so happen to follow sexual 
mischief… boy there are some microbes running around now.

‘Sexual
 sins are numerous and many, I have a few myself. So what is your safest
 course of action? If you’re a man, find yourself a woman, marry them 
and keep your sex right there.

‘You
 can have fun, but one thing is for sure, as long as you are both 
healthy in the first place, you are not going to catch some debilitating
 illness, there is safety there.

‘Commonsense
 says we are not going to procreate the human race unless we have a man 
and a woman. From the beginning Jesus said, "It is a man and a woman." 
Adam was made and Eve was made for this reason. They left their fathers 
and mothers and united to become one flesh, that’s what marriage is 
all about.'

The family are multimillionaires due to the success of Phil’s Duck Commander Company, which he formed in 1973 to sell the duck call he invented a year earlier.
