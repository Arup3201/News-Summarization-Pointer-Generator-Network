The model whose multimillionaire husband hired a hit man to kill her has revealed she still fears he will come back into her life. 

Dino Guglielmelli was jailed for nine years in June 2014 for plotting the murder of Monica Olson, his wife of almost a decade and mother of his two daughters.

The lengthy court case in Los Angeles heard recorded phone calls in which Guglielmelli, a vitamin tycoon whose business greatly benefited from his wife's skin care line, said he was '100 per cent' sure he wanted Olson dead.

Now, half a year later, Olson tells 48 HOURS: 'I know his intention is to reunite himself with the kids and take those children away from me.

'Do I think about it? Yes.'

Whistle-blower: Hired hit man Rick Fuhrmann took recordings of phone calls with Guglielmelli to the police

She said she is fully aware of her former husband's plans: 'He wanted to make it look like a drug killing. Like I had been kidnapped in Mexico. He wanted me raped, and he wanted my head cut off.

'It's the Hunger Games; it's kill or be killed.' 

But in a phone call from prison, Guglielmelli told the documentary he is the victim. 

'I've been criminalized, Troy,' he told 48 HOURS reporter Troy Roberts. 'It's just destroyed my life. And I don't get it, I don't understand why everyone wants to attack me, and this guy set me up.' 

Guglielmelli was ultimately sentenced after the court was played phone calls between him and his hired hit man Rick Fuhrmann, who went to the police.

Shocked that Guglielmelli 'had it all' and still wanted to commit such an act, Fuhrmann says he deliberately stalled the operation - even pretended he had infected Olson with AIDS. 

He said Guglielmelli was constantly dating other women and contacted him when the marriage started to break down. 

Fuhrmann told the program: 'He wanted her dead and he didn't care how it was done - beat her up, cut her head off, put her in ditch.'

Instead he handed in his recorded messages to the district attorney.

Plot: Guglielmelli, who the court heard was consistently unfaithful, hired Fuhrmann to kill Olson 

One included:

Rick Fuhrmann: 'You're positive?'

Dino Guglielmelli: 'That what?'

Rick Fuhrmann: 'You want her dead?'

Dino Guglielmelli: 'Oh, I'm...'

Rick Fuhrmann: '100 percent?'

Dino Guglielmelli: 'Why wouldn't I?'

Rick Fuhrmann: 'Why wouldn't you? Good question.'

According to Monica, Dino's mood started to change when she tried to start her own skin care line - which was ultimately a success - for he wanted her to stay at home.

'Monica is lucky because, in the end, Rick Fuhrmann is not a killer. He is someone that might bend the truth or omit the truth, but he's not a killer. And that's what saved Monica,' said Los Angeles Assistant District Attorney Emily Cole. 

Despite the guilty verdict, which Guglielmelli is unable to appeal, two of Dino's six older brothers are determined to defend their sibling - slamming a recorded phone call between Dino and the hit man as unconvincing.

Tearful: In court at her husband's sentencing Olson wept as she described her shock 

Speaking to 48 HOURS, Gino and Emilio Guglielmelli dismissed their former sister-in-law as a 'gold digger' and said they were unconvinced by the evidence heard in Los Angeles Superior Court.

'I really didn't think anybody was going to be dead,' Gino insists, slamming a tape which purported to show Dino dealing with the hit man as flimsy proof. 

Emilio says of Olson: 'I didn't care for her. I thought she was a gold-digger, and had other motives.'  

The brothers, who grew up on a Washington State farm, describe Olson as a trophy wife.  

Gino said: 'She wanted her lifestyle that wasn't sitting at home. You know, her lifestyle was to go to Hollywood, and whatever they do in Hollywood. 

'They had nannies ... people with the girls, you know, all day long. ... So he's probably spent more time with 'em. Because when he'd come home from work, sometimes she wouldn't come back ... until later in the evening.'

Unconvinced: Emilio Guglielmelli believes his younger brother's ex-wife Olson was a 'gold digger'

Last year, the brothers filed character testimonies to court for Dino, saying that he started his working life in 1984 sweeping factory floors before rising through the ranks to become an office manager in just three years.

He studied for a business degree in his spare time before spending seven years as an executive for a waste disposal company.

They said he cashed in $130,000 worth of stock he'd acquired in the company to start his own beauty supplements business Creation's Garden.

At it's height, the firm employed 250 people, had four factories and made $48 million a year.

One of the most successful lines was Monica's skin care brand. But immediately after his arrest, Guglielmelli gave his brother Gino power of attorney and filed for bankruptcy citing debts of just over $1 million.

The firm, whose assets included $8 million worth of stock, was eventually sold off at auction.
