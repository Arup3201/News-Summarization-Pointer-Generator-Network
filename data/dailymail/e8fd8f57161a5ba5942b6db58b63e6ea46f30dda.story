A late penalty from Alvaro Negredo was enough to hand Valencia a third straight win as they secured a first-leg win over Espanyol in their last 16 Copa del Rey tie at the Mestalla Stadium.

The Spaniard - on a season-long loan from Premier League champions Manchester City - sent Pau Lopez the wrong way from the spot to give the hosts a one-goal advantage going into the reverse fixture next week.

Christian Stuani's fine effort had cancelled out Jose Gaya's first-half opener, before Negredo came up trumps for the hosts late on with just his second goal since joining the club to make it 2-1.

Valencia took full advantage of being on home surroundings as they took the lead inside 11 minutes.

Jose Gaya advanced forward from left back before finishing smartly from 15 yards out giving Lopez no chance in the Espanyol goal.

After a slow start the visitors gradually got a foothold back into the game, and were unlucky not to level proceedings just after the half-hour mark, as Victor Alvarez was denied at point-blank range from Valencia stopper Yoel.

Despite going into the half-time interval a goal down, Espanyol refused to lie down and deservedly got themselves back on level terms on the hour mark.

Uruguay forward Stuani made room for himself on the edge of the Valencia box before unleashing a precise right-footed drive, which in turn flew past Yoel and into the top corner.

The Valencia No 1 was counting his blessings soon after though, when he nearly gifted Espanyol the lead after fumbling the ball inside the area.

Lucas Vazquez was quickest to react but couldn't adjust his body in time to make full contact with the ball, as it hit the side-netting.

The visitors were left to rue on that missed opportunity with Negredo making no mistake from the spot with four minutes remaining, as Valencia ensured they would go into next week's second leg with a crucial advantage, and at the same time preserve their six-game unbeaten run.
