 

Wayne Rooney admits that he knew his ‘ghost’ goal was going to be ruled out before the match officials spotted their error in Miami.

The England striker had already pulled United level against Liverpool when he tucked home a loose ball after Ashley Young’s speculative effort had bounced off the frame of the goal and back into play.

Referee Mark Geigher awarded the goal and Rooney gave team-mates an embarrassed smile as he walked back towards the centre circle before it became clear that the ball had gone out.

‘I don’t think the other goal was going to be given so I was pleased with one, and with the result,’ said Rooney.

‘We wanted to win games and play well, and obviously we’ve done that. We’ve won a trophy as well. It’s always nice to beat Liverpool. We’re happy with the work we’ve done out here, now we go on to (the friendly against) Valencia and then the season starts.’

Rooney started the game as captain for the first time under Louis van Gaal and finished it by being named as the Most Valuable Player of the tournament.

Afterwards, Van Gaal hinted that Rooney could keep the armband on a permanent basis, and the player paid tribute to the impact the Dutchman has had since taking over last month. Having implemented a new 3-4-1-2 system to suit his squad, Van Gaal has won all five games on tour.

‘It’s been a good few weeks,’ added Rooney. ‘We’ve got a new manager who wants us to play a different style of football. We’ve had to adapt. We’ve had some good results against top opposition so we can be pleased.

‘I think the system suits the team, not only myself. The manager came in and had a look at the players we’ve got. He’s done what he thinks is best suited for our team.

‘He’s a tough manager but he’s been great since he came in. He’s given us all a different way of looking at football, which we haven’t had before. It’s been great for us and hopefully that will continue.’
