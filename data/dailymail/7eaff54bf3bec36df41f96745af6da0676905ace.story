A-list support: Scriptwriter and director Rebecca Rian has received backing from famous faces including Jennifer Aniston (pictured) to help raise the £1.3million needed to fund her feature-length film Jacob And I 

Rebecca told the Sunday People: 'I think they respect that I'm turning something sad into a positive, which is why they are willing to get behind it.

'Everyone knows someone who has been affected by stillbirths or miscarriages. Even A-listers.'

Rebecca and her husband Daniel's ordeal began in 2008 when she first fell pregnant, but at six months they discovered their son Jacob had died in the womb when she went into premature labour.

Within a five year period, the couple also suffered the heartbreak of nine miscarriages, including twins. 

In 2011, Rebecca finally welcomed a healthy baby girl called Ayva, but they will never forget their son.

'These stars have helped give Jacob a voice and a legacy', she added.

Jacob And I, which is currently in production and is being filmed in both London and Los Angeles, follows the emotional journey of two parents who are on a journey to be reunited with their son.  

In a promotional video for the movie on fundraising website KickStarter, Mrs Rian says: 'Who is Jacob? Jacob is what the world and medical profession classify as a stillbirth. To me, Jacob was a son.

Doing something positive: Iggy Azelea has also backed the campaign, which aims to raise £1.3million via a Kickstarter page

30 Days to go: Stars like David Walliams are urging people to donate so the film, which is being shot in both London and Los Angeles, can reach completion

Giving Jacob a voice: The couple now have three-year-old daughter Ayva, but their son Jacob will always have a place in their heart

'The point of Jacob And I is to recreate life, it was to give Jacob a leading role, to give him a voice, to let him tell his story.

'As a writer it's very important to me to make sure that every aspect is believable, and it's real and you are able to understand what the character's life and thoughts are about. This is his story.'

Mrs Rian hopes to raise the £1.3million to fund the film, which will be produced by Tracey Hicks and Jason Swain and released in 2015, through donations.
