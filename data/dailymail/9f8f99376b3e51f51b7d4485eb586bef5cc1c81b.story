The Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium has been ordered to stop using cattle dogs in a way that causes 'behavioral stress' to its elephants.

Australian cattle dogs have been used at the zoo to help handlers control elephants since 2012. 

And the zoo's president and CEO, Dr Barbara Baker, said since their introduction, neither the dogs, elephants nor keepers have been injured.

However, following an inspection report last month, the zoo has been told by the federal government to immediately stop using the dogs in ways that upset the elephants.

Australian cattle dogs (herders Major and Zeta pictured at the zoo above) have been used to help handlers control elephants since 2012. The zoo's president and CEO, Dr Barbara Baker, said since their introduction, neither the dogs, elephants nor keepers have been injured

The January 7 report conducted by the US Department of Agriculture was released yesterday by animal rights group PETA, who complained about the practice last year.

'When elephants, dogs and human handlers freely mix, everyone is in danger,' said Delcianna Winders, a lawyer for PETA.  

Australian cattle dogs give staff an important safety buffer when dealing with the giant animals, according to the zoo.

Officials from the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service visited the zoo on January 6 and watched an unnamed manager demonstrate how the dogs are used, according to the report.

The manager called one dog to 'create a barrier between the husbandry staff and an elephant' which had reached its trunk through the enclosure bars. 

During the demonstration, the dog 'showed aggressive behavior, growling and lunging at one elephant' and entering its enclosure before being called back by the manager.

A January 7 report conducted by the US Department of Agriculture was released yesterday by PETA, who complained about the practice last year. They have called on the zoo to use a 'safe' and 'modern' method

Baker said their method of animal management, in the livestock field, is referred to as a low-stress method

The report also revealed the manager said the dogs had bitten the elephants during the course of their work.

A television news clip from May verified by zoo officials also 'showed the elephants exhibiting signs of distress when charged by one of the dogs, including ear flapping, trumpeting, and turning and running away,' according to the report. 

Baker issued a statement defending the method, and said the dogs read the behavior of the animals, alert the keepers to any disruption in the herd preventing potential safety concerns for the staff and elephants.

She said: 'This method of animal management, in the livestock field, is referred to as a low-stress method.'

The zoo defended its use of the dogs in a written statement and said the method has been scientifically proven and recognized by the USDA

Baker also said that during the inspection, 'our elephant manager demonstrated a drill simulating the dog's response to a keeper being in an extreme and unlikely situation. We showed how valuable the dogs can be should a keeper's safety be in question.' 

The zoo must now control the elephants without causing them 'behavioral stress' and was ordered the change 'from this point forward.'

PETA contend zoos should use barriers to separate handlers and elephants at all times and use only positive reinforcement to control elephants. 

Winders said: 'PETA is calling on the Pittsburgh Zoo to switch to safe and modern elephant-management method — or, better yet, to retire the elephants to an accredited sanctuary where they'll be free from harassment for the rest of their lives.' 

'The introduction of the dogs has been a valuable tool as we continue to elevate the care and management of our elephant herd,' said Dr Barbara Baker, President and CEO of the Pittsburgh Zoo. 

'The safety of our keepers and animals is a top priority and we provide an additional safety level with the use of trained cattle dogs. 

'The dogs read the behavior of the animals and alert the keepers to any disruption in the heard, preventing potential safety concerns for the staff and elephants. 

'This method of animal management, in the livestock field, is referred to as a low-stress method. 

'These methods, which have been scientifically proven and recognized by the USDA, ensure a calm and controlled interaction between an animal, the dogs, and keepers they work with.'

During the recent USDA visit, upon direct request of the USDA inspector, our elephant manager demonstrated a drill simulating the dog's response to a keeper being in an extreme and unlikely situation. 

'We showed how valuable the dogs can be should a keeper's safety be in question,' said Dr Baker.

Since the arrival of the dogs in 2012, no keepers, elephants, or dogs have been injured. 

Also, the USDA has conducted six annual inspections, at the Zoo and International Conservation Center during that period, and found no non-compliant concerns.

In cooperation with the USDA, the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium is in the process of developing a study that examines a variety of facets regarding the welfare of elephants, including a unique examination of stress. 

This research will provide additional information into understanding elephant biology and behavior.

Zoo officials have said they do not punish their elephants for not complying with human handlers and use only positive reinforcement to control their behavior. 

The Pittsburgh Zoo has begun working with the USDA on a study 'that examines a variety of facets regarding the welfare of elephants, including a unique examination of stress,' said Baker.

The USDA noted that a sea lion at the aquarium had swollen corneas from too much chlorine in her water, and that a zoo veterinarian determined most 'marine mammals have had issues with corneal disease' likely caused by too much chlorine. 

The zoo was supposed to have addressed that issue by January 21, according to the report.
