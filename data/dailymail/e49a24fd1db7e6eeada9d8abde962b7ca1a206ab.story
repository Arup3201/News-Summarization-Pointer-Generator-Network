Ed Balls was derided last week for his red-faced and shouted response to the Autumn Statement, as Labour MPs criticised his performance as one of the worst they have seen in the House of Commons.

And today, the shadow chancellor lived up to his nickname of ‘Red Ed’ as he appeared in the Commons dressed as Father Christmas for a vote on the Government’s banking reform Bill.

Mr Balls, 46, arrived in the chamber in a full Santa outfit, complete with boots, red hood and what looked like a pillow stuffed under his coat to make him fatter.

Santa: Pamela Nash, Labour MP for Airdrie and Shotts, posted this photograph on Twitter of herself with Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls in the House of Commons lobby

Christmas spirit: Garry Blachere, of Christmas lights company Blachere UK, posted this picture of Mr Balls as he fulfilled his annual duty at the Commons Christmas party for the children of MPs and parliamentary staff

Fellow Labour colleagues Barry Gardiner, MP for Brent North, and Yasmin Qureshi, MP for Bolton South East, were seen patting the shadow chancellor’s stomach.

They voted on Labour proposals to bring forward a cap on payday lenders from January 2015 to next October.

The Labour amendments to the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill, both of which were defeated, would have also forced lenders to share information about customers to stop people taking out multiple loans.

The dress code for MPs in the Commons is strict, especially for men. They must wear a jacket and tie at all times, except when there are votes. They are then allowed to pop into the voting lobbies in less formal attire.

It has been known with late night votes for some MPs to be wearing their gym kit but this is the first time it is believed an MP has appeared in the Commons dressed as Santa.

Stuart Andrew, Conservative MP for Pudsey, Horsforth & Aireborough, said on Twitter: 'Seen it all now. Division in the Commons and Ed Balls has dressed for the occasion....as Santa!'

Lampooned: Last week Mr Balls was ribbed online after his speech in response to the Autumn Statement which led to his name trending on Twitter and people using the #RedEd hashtag

Mr Balls, who has endured a tough week after his much-derided performance at the Autumn Statement last Thursday, was dressed as Santa as he was fulfilling his annual duty at the Commons Christmas party for the children of MPs and parliamentary staff.

The event is organised each year by fellow Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee.

The event in the Members’ Dining Room, which is in its 17th year, also featured a bouncy castle, face painters and a magic show, according to a press release from Mr Vaz.

Proceeds from the party are going to the charity World Vision, which supports children’s education in Africa. Mr Vaz said: ‘This party is without doubt one of the most popular of the year.

‘Children of MPs and staff are coming together for an afternoon of fun. It is a chance for MPs and staff to bond with their kids and to support a good cause.’
