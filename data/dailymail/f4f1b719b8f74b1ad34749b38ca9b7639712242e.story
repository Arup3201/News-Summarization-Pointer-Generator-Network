Brendan Rodgers hailed Raheem Sterling’s brilliance and insisted he is the man to fire Liverpool to Wembley.

The revitalised Liverpool forward showed the benefits of a mid-season break in the Caribbean by scoring a magnificent goal to ensure the first leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final with Chelsea ended 1-1.

After Eden Hazard had put Chelsea ahead with a penalty, Liverpool roared back and Sterling scored a magnificent goal, waltzing past Nemanja Matic and Gary Cahill before finishing confidently with his left foot.

Only a string of superb saves from Thibaut Courtois kept Jose Mourinho’s team in the game – Liverpool had 20 shots compared to the six of Chelsea – and Rodgers has no doubt Liverpool are ready to go to Stamford Bridge and win.

Rodgers, who hopes Daniel Sturridge will be fit for the second leg, said: ‘The rest has done him the world of good. He was outstanding. He has that ability to move in behind but he can also exploit the space in front.

‘His speed was frightening to come in and finish, wonderful goal. He certainly deserved that. We are getting better as each game goes on. This is a team that has done very well. We have to keep our focus and concentration and we will try to continue to perform in that way.

‘You see defensively how we were: aggressive, compact. Chelsea have got top-class players. I thought the performance was a benchmark. There is absolutely no doubt we can go to the second leg and get the performance we need to go through.’ 

Sterling added: ‘It’s always good to get on the scoresheet and help the team out. I’ve felt the benefit of the break because there are times you need a bit of rest and the manager gave me some time off and it’s helped. We’re still in the tie and Chelsea will be difficult but helpfully we can get a result.’

Rodgers felt referee Martin Atkinson missed two big decisions, one when Diego Costa appeared to handle in the area and another when Courtois, returning after a three-match absence, carried the ball out of his area. That was the only blemish on Courtois’ outstanding display.

Mourinho said: ‘The Premier League is full of top goalkeepers but we have the two best so for me it is so easy and to have both playing so well and giving so much confidence to the team the players don’t care who plays.’

Chelsea’s manager later appeared to take a dig at Liverpool for letting Steven Gerrard leave when his contract expires. 

When asked if he would make a cheeky bid to sign him, Mourinho told 5 Live: 'Or perhaps to take him on loan? I would love the Premier League to keep the best players and I believe he has the quality to play for more years.’
