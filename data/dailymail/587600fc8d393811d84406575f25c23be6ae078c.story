It was just another holiday snap. Sat side-by-side and perched on a fence, five young men with unkempt hair and wearing serious expressions stare into the camera.

The year was 1982 and the photo was taken on a self-timed camera during a vacation at Copco Lake in northern California.

The men in the picture - John Wardlaw, Mark Rumer, Dallas Burney, John Molony, John Dickson - were high school friends from Santa Barbara, California, who at just 19 had their whole lives ahead of them.

1987: Five years later and the men decide to recreate their 1982 photo by adopting a similar pose

1992: Now approaching 30, the men again strike a similar pose as they establish a five-yearly tradition

Little did they know that they would be taking that exact same photo once every five years for the next three decades.

But that's what happened, and the six
follow-up photos are testament to the strong bond of friendship as the 
five men's appearances slowly change over the years.

The original July 1982 image featured three of the men - all called John - topless in the summer sun.

But what sets it apart from other 
holiday pictures is the empty coffee jar held by Mr Molony. It contained
a cockroach that the friends had decided to keep as a pet.

Mr Wardlaw told CNN: 'For some 
reason, we all chose to have dark and mysterious expressions on our 
faces. I'm sure we all thought we were being really cool.

'Priorities were so different back then. All I was really thinking about was summer and girls.'

1997: The friends take their photo from a slightly different angle

2002: Wearing solemn expressions, they seem keen to recreate the atmosphere of the original photo

2007: The men celebrate the 25th anniversary of the original photo by keeping their tradition alive

2012: Fast approaching 50, the friends this year celebrated Mr Dickson's (right) upcoming nuptials

Over the next few years, the men - all now at university - continued to make annual pilgrimages to Copco Lake.

But it wasn't until 1987 that Mr Wardlaw, a photography enthusiast, decided the friends should try and recreate the 1982 photo.

So the men sat in the same order, 
adopted the same poses and expressions as they had done five years 
earlier, and took a replica image again using a self-timed camera.

The only noticeable differences are the men's late-80s hairstyles and a slightly different jar that contained no cockroach.

Mr Wardlaw said: 'I think I had a 
feeling this might become some cool tradition, but I had no idea we 
would still be doing it for 30 years.'

Group photo: Taking the picture has become more sophisticated in recent years, with the men desperate for it to turn out as accurate as possible to the 1982 original

In the more recent images, the men have become increasingly particular about replicating the details of the original photo.

So some have opted to wear the same clothes, while an 'official' jar and hat have been selected to use every five years.

Although the men, now approaching 50, live separate lives, they always gather for their five-yearly vacation to Copco Lake.

Over the years, they have been guest at each others' weddings and some have moved out of California.

Mr Dickson work as a restaurant 
columnist and got married this month - in June, the five friends turned 
their get-together into a stag celebration.

Mr Wardlaw works in photography and 
film; Mr Burney is a teacher; Mr Molony works for UPS, is married and 
moved to New Orleans, Louisiana; and Mr Rumer is retired and lives in 
Oregon.

None of the men has children.
