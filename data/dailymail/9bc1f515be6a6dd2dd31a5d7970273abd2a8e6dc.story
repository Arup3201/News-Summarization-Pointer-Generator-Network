An Orlando photographer had a hairy moment when a black bear decided to try its paw at car washing.

Red Huber had nearly finished washing his car in his Longwood neighborhood driveway when he 'had the strange feeling' someone was watching him.'

Huber then spotted the young animal staring at him from about 20 feet away, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

Red Huber was rinsing off his vehicle in his Longwood neighborhood driveway in Orlando when he spotted a young black bear staring at him from about 20 feet away

The Orlando Sentinel photographer said he and the bear locked eyes and froze in place for a few seconds. 

But the bear then turned its attention to the garden hose and Mr Huber's photographic instincts took over as he carefully moved toward his garage to grab his camera.

As the emboldened black bear dipped its paw into a soapy pail of water, Mr Huber was able to take pictures of the cheeky would-be carwasher.

The bear then tipped the pail over, watched the suds run down the cement driveway and scampered away into a nearby wooded  area.

The Florida Black Bear is a subspecies of the North American Black Bear and is Florida's largest native land animal.

The animal is most active in the area in October and November when preparing for the winter. 

Black bears are found in most parts of North America and, despite being less dangerous to humans than their bigger grizzly cousins, adults can still weigh up to 550lb.

in Central Florida, sprawling subdivisions have sprung up in former bear habitats and along their natural corridors around the Ocala National Forest.
