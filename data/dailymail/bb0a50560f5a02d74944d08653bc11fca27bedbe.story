A gangster tried to blackmail a prison guard after convincing him to let women into his cell for romps, including with the warden's wife.

Wang Tse - who has been jailed three times for robbery and kidnapping - convinced guards to let him use a prison computer in Nehe, in northern China's Heilongjiang province, to log on to dating websites.  

After persuading the guards to let the women he met into his cell for sex, Tse, 30, blackmailed both the guards and the women he bedded.

He attempted to extort money by threatening them with nude pictures he had taken of them.

Two victims told police they were forced to pay him the equivalent of £10,000 to prevent him from sending the pictures to their families.

And Tse regularly used the WeChat app to groom new victims. 

He was only stopped when he tried to blackmail a guard after seducing and bedding his wife, who instead reported him to the prison governor.

Officials said three prison guards have been suspended and are under investigation. 

Prison spokesman Shi Chou said: 'He is an extremely manipulative and dangerous man.'

He added: 'He would take naked pictures of the women to blackmail them with, then he would threaten the prison police officers who had helped him with exposure.

'Some of the women were married and had a lot to lose.'  

Tse bribed the women with nude pictures he took of them in his prison cell and two told police they paid him the equivalent of £10,000 to stop him from sending the pictures to their families
