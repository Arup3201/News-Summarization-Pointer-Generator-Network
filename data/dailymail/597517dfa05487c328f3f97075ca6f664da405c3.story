Wales coach Robin McBryde has warned fans that attractive and entertaining rugby is low on the agenda ahead of Saturday's RBS 6 Nations Test against Ireland.

Recent comments from All Blacks boss Steve Hansen about the game being 'geared towards defences that inhibit attack' have sparked debate around the sport's marketability, with McBryde predicting another war of attrition at the Millennium Stadium.

Asked if he expects a feast of running rugby, the 44-year-old said: 'I'm not too sure about that. There is a lot at stake. Ireland are on course for a Grand Slam and just to get away from Cardiff with a win, that's all they will be looking to do.

'With regards to playing any attractive rugby, that will come second. That's the nature of the game at the moment and that's how teams are wearing each other down and, unfortunately, the spectators have got to pay a price for that.'

Wales have beaten Ireland just twice in Cardiff over the last 32 years and McBryde is expecting one of the toughest challenges to date against the championship favourites.

'They are on a bit of a roll at the moment — 10 wins on the bounce,' said McBryde. 'Certainly from the outside it looks a very happy camp. This is quite a formidable Ireland team and we are going to have to be at our best to come close to them.'

All eyes will be on the battle of the skies as the hosts look to end the visitors' Grand Slam push and keep alive their own championship hopes.

They have been working overtime to nullify the aerial bombardment from Jonathan Sexton and Conor Murray, with scrum-half Rhys Webb promising not to repeat the mistakes that England made in Dublin two weeks ago.

'I don't know if England did much analysis on them,' said Webb. 'They didn't seem to put much pressure on nine and 10 whatsoever. We need to be on the money and we know there is no margin for error.'

It promises to be an intense tactical battle between Warren Gatland and counterpart Joe Schmidt, with the former subjected to a bitter personal attack by retired Ireland lock Neil Francis during the week. Gatland was said to have 'the intellectual properties of a tub of Flora', although Ireland captain Paul O'Connell holds the Kiwi in much higher regard.

'For as long as I can remember we've being trying to poach ideas from Warren Gatland,' said O'Connell.

'We played Wasps with Munster in 2003 or 2004 and they were so far ahead in terms of how they were playing and how the players were prepared from an S&C (strength and conditioning) and nutritional point of view.

It was a rude awakening. He makes complicated things very simple and he probably pioneered that way of thinking.

'At the start of the championship, Joe said the Wales- England game was going to be the standard-bearer. Two years ago Ireland beat (Wales) in the first game and they just built and built and built until they absolutely erupted in that final game against England.

'They'll feel the same thing is happening now.'

A lot has changed since Paul O'Connell played the first of his 100 Tests more than 13 years ago. Professionalism has been the key to the former shelf-stacker's longevity, although he has not always been surrounded by such healthy company.

On the week of his debut in 2002 — against Wales in Dublin — the young and enthusiastic second-row had to share a room with former Munster team-mate Peter Clohessy.

'I was woken by the smell of cigarette smoke in my nostrils every morning,' recalled a laughing O'Connell. 'The Claw' used to have a cigarette the moment he woke up. I was well aware this was not the way forward.

'Obviously it's changed a lot since then. Now in Irish camp I take a lot of advice from (strength and conditioning coach) Jason Cowman. Jonny Sexton is obviously (another) great guy to copy and follow.'

Kicking game

In Conor Murray and Jonathan Sexton, Ireland have the world's in-form kicking half-back combination. Their aerial game-plan was predictable against England yet Stuart Lancaster did not have the players at his disposable to stop it. Wales, however, have one of the best defensive back-threes in the world and Leigh Halfpenny is a master at limiting the space to kick into. How well Ireland anticipate that — perhaps using Sexton as a looping runner, if the wingers drop back — will be highly significant.

Set-piece

At 6ft 9in and 6ft 11in, Luke Charteris of Wales and Devin Toner of Ireland are two of the tallest players in the competition. They are both extremely difficult to beat on their own line-out throw, while they can be equally disruptive towards their opponents'. Their long limbs are used to try and steal ball, although that can leave the defending side open to attack from the driving maul, where both Wales and Ireland are particularly effective. Picking the right moments to challenge will be pivotal; a responsibility that falls on the shoulders of Alun-Wyn Jones and Paul O'Connell.

Breakdown

Welsh defence coach Shaun Edwards claims his players are the best in the world at contesting the post-tackle area. However, they will face their toughest breakdown battle yet against Ireland, who won 23 turnovers to nine against England in round three. Warren Gatland's game-plan relies heavily on quick recycled ball and Ireland will look to slow that down to limit the risk from the likes of Jamie Roberts and George North. Getting on the right side of referee Wayne Barnes will be key, because Halfpenny and Sexton are two of the world's leading goal-kickers.
