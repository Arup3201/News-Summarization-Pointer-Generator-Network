Watching Barack Obama hug her young daughter, Cristina Hassinger should have felt elated.

But the moment was tinged with sadness as the only reason the youngster was in the arms of the president of the U.S. was because her heroic grandmother had been shot dead two days early.

Dawn Hochsprung was the principal of Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut and was gunned down trying to stop Adam Lanzer from entering the building.

Comfort: In the hours leading up to an interfaith memorial ceremony in Newtown on Sunday night, Mr Obama met the families of victims and held Mrs Hochsprung's granddaughter

The 47-year-old ran out of a meeting to confront the armed attacker, but she was killed trying to save her pupils.

In the hours leading up to an interfaith memorial ceremony in 
Newtown on Sunday night, Mr Obama met the families of victims and Mrs Hochsprung's daughter Cristina Hassinger posted a photo of the moment to 
Twitter.

Ms Hassinger used the poignant caption: 'My mom would be SO proud to see
President Obama holding her granddaughter. But not as proud as I am of 
her.'

Her grief at losing her mother who was pursuing her Ph.D.,   is clear on her Twitter page.

Presidential reply: Newtown football coach Steven George and teacher Bob Pattison left a message on a whiteboard at Newtown High School for President Obama, and he responded

As the news broke the mother-of-four simply wrote 'My mother was murdered. Murdered. This can't be real.'

But the next day she tweeted 'My mom, Dawn Hochsprung, was taken tragically from me. But she went down in a blaze of glory that truly represents who she was.'

Meanwhile Mrs  Hochsprung's husband has spoken about how his world was shattered in light of her death.

Her husband George said that the 
initial anger he felt after hearing that his wife confronted Lanzer  has
gone away since he heard from two of the teachers that she helped save.

'Dawn
put herself in jeopardy and I have been angry about that- angry- until 
just now, today, when I met the two women who she told to go under 
shelter while she confronted the gunman and she could have avoided that,
but she didn't and I knew she wouldn't,' Mr Hochsprung told CNN.

I'm not angry anymore, I'm just very sad.'

Happier days: George Hochsprung said that he and Dawn planned to spend years together at a house they built on a lake in the Adirondacks

Traumatic: One of the third grade students said that she recognized Mrs Hochsprung's voice over the intercom, and that she also heard what she believed to be the shooter say 'put your hands up'

Dawn 'ran out, and actually tried to subdue the killer. I don't know where that comes from, Dawn was five-foot-two.'

Though the specifics of the timeline of events inside the school are still being ironed out by investigators, it is thought that Mrs Hochsprung was the one who may have thought to turn the intercom system on so that the entire school would be immediately alerted to the impending danger.

One of the third grade students said that she recognized Mrs Hochsprung's voice over the intercom, and that she also heard what she believed to be the shooter say 'put your hands up'.

Tales of her heroism are helping Mrs Hochsprung's relatives process their grief, but only slightly.

Picking up the pieces: George Hochsprung sits surrounded by his three daughters from his first marriage (two on the left and one on far right) and one of Dawn's daughters Erica from her first marriage (to George's immediate right)

Emotional: George got choked up and Erica began weeping during an interview about the principal's life

'Dawn and I built this beautiful house in the Adirondacks, our dream. And the dream was a chronological dream it was going to be Dawn's house: I was going to die because I'm much older than Dawn, it was going to be Dawn's house. Dawn's grandchildren and all these children could use the house on the lake and it would be wonderful,' Mr Hochsprung said.

'We built rooms downstairs for kids and it was going to be Dawn's house ultimately, with all the children. And now it's me- I don't think I can do that.'

Crime scene: Lanza forced his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday morning

Mr Hochsprung met Dawn when she was his boss, working as the assistant principal in the area middle school while he was teaching seventh grade math.

It was actually one of his students who told him the devastating news on Friday morning.

'One of the kids came up with a computer and said "something's happening at Sandy Hook school and you're wife's been killed,"' George told CNN.

The Hochsprung family is made up of George's three daughters from his first marriage, Dawn's two daughters from her first marriage, and their collective 11 grandchildren.

A tearful Erica, Dawn’s youngest daughter whose upcoming summer wedding 
her mother will miss, said that if she was given the chance to say one 
final thing to her mom who she called 'my rock', it would be simple: 
'Come back, just come back.'
