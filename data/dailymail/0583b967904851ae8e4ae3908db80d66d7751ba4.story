A former New York City assistant district attorney and philanthropist has died after falling in a Florida horse jumping competition.

Anne Heyman, 52, died in Wellington, Florida, on Friday after a fall at the Palm Beach International Equestrian Center at about 10:30 a.m. She was flown to Delray Medical Center, where she died three hours later.

Heyman was born in South Africa and attended the George Washington School of Law. She went on to work for the Manhattan district attorney's office and later led the creation of the Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village, a community for children orphaned during the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

Mourning: Current and former residents of the Agahozo-Shalom Village are devastated by Heyman's death

'Each of us grieves not only for the passing of a tremendous woman and a true visionary, but also for the loss suffered by her family,' the organization said in an announcement posted on its website.

'She has made a remarkable impact on this world and we will continue to work to uphold her legacy.'

Rwandan officials also mourned her loss.

'Deeply saddened by sudden passing of Anne Heyman,' wrote Rwandan Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo in a message on Twitter. 'I know she lives on in many vibrant Rwandan girls she worked hard for.'

Heyman and her husband, Seth Merrin, were inspired to help Rwandan orphans after hearing about their struggles at a talk about the genocide in 2005.

Heyman was reminded of the residential living communities built in Israel for orphans of the Holocaust and wanted to bring a similar model to Rwanda, according to the Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village's website.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Agahozo Shalom is a combination of Hebrew and Kinyarwanda languages meaning 'a place to dry one's tears and live in peace.'

The first 125 students moved in to the village in 2008. The organization is now home to 500 children.

Heyman is survived by her husband, Seth Merrin, their three children and hundreds of Rwandan orphans, who called her 'Big Momma.'

Heyman and Merrin raised $12 million to build the village outside Kigali in eastern Rwanda.

'It’s the worst thing that could happen to us - again,' Emmanuel Nkundunkundiye, 21, a recent graduate told the Forward from the campus outside the Rwanda capital of Kigali. 'It’s like being made an orphan all over again.'

Heyman visited the village every two or three months and would live there with the children for weeks at a time.

Just two weeks ago, Heyman presided over the school’s graduation ceremony, which also marked the 20th anniversary of the 1994 killing spree in which hundreds of thousands were killed.

The children who have been there three or four years knew her very well and felt like she wasn’t only a grandmother to them, but also a guardian angel in some ways,' board member Lisa Issroff told the Palm Beach Post.

'She was an extraordinarily compassionate person to everyone, but in particular for people that were vulnerable.'

In a bio on the organization's website, Heyman is described as 'an avid equestrian and competition show jumper' who lived in Manhattan with her husband and three children.

Compassion: Heyman had a special affinity with vulnerable people and children

She fell Friday during a master's jumper competition, FTI Consulting Winter Equestrian Festival spokeswoman Jennifer Wood told the Palm Beach Post.

Deputies said Saturday Heyman became dislodged from the horse after a jump and began leaning to the left side. The horse began to pick up speed and Heyman fell off.

Witnesses told investigators Heyman struck the back of her head.

She died from cardiac arrest while undergoing emergency surgery.

Funeral details are expected to be shared in the coming days.
