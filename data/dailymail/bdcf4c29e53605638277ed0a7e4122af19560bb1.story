Abu Hamza was ordered to show his amputated limbs as his terror trial started in the US yesterday.Potential jurors were asked if the physical appearance of the radical  cleric – who also has a missing eye – would affect their ability to try him fairly.

Hamza’s hooks have been removed for security reasons and one was later replaced with a prosthetic limb fitted with a pen so he could take notes.

He sat silently through the selection of the jury, who will decide if he is guilty of conspiring to support Al Qaeda.

Set to speak: Abu Hamza al-Misray, seen in a court sketch from Monday's jury selection, is due to testify in his own defense against charges that he worked to help al Qaeda

Injured: Hamza, who has one eye and claims to have lost his hands fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan, had prosthetic arms that he wore at points during Monday's hearing which allowed him to write

Security was tightened for the hearing
 in Manhattan, just a few streets from the site of the World Trade 
Centre destroyed by the terror group in 2001.

But
 because of New York’s devastation in the September 11 attacks, lawyers 
face a challenge whittling out jurors who do not have a direct link to 
the outrage.

US District 
Judge Katharine Forrest asked Hamza to stand in court as she told 
prospective jurors that both of his arms have been amputated.

Back and forth: Hamza, who also goes by the name Mustafa Kamel Mustafa (pictured in 2003), has been arrested and in prison in the UK since 2004 on separate charges before he was extradited to the U.S.

The
 British cleric, 55, who was born in Egypt and who once worked as a 
nightclub bouncer, claims he lost his arms in a landmine blast while 
fighting the  Soviets in Afghanistan.

‘I think I am innocent,’ he told the judge during a hearing last week, saying he wants to ‘have a chance to defend myself’.

Prosecutors want to use some of his hate-filled sermons from the Finsbury Park Mosque in North London as evidence.

The mosque was attended by convicted shoe-bomber Richard Reid and Zacarias Moussaoui, who admitted being part of the 9/11 plot.

Judge
 Forrest has yet to rule whether they will be admissible in court.

Hamza
 was first charged in 2004 but has fought a protracted battle against 
extradition before being brought to the US in 2012.

He
 denies 11 terror charges, including planning to set up a terror 
training camp in Oregon and being involved in the 1998 kidnap of 
tourists in Yemen.

Four of them, including three Britons, were killed. 
If found guilty, he faces a life sentence.

The
 trial of Abu Hamza, who was arrested under the name Mustafa Kamel 
Mustafa, comes weeks after a jury convicted Osama bin Laden's son-in-law
 Sulaiman Abu Ghaith of charges stemming from his role as al Qaeda's 
spokesman after the September 11 attacks.
