The BBC is reportedly footing a near £15,000 bill for The Voice star Sir Tom Jones to stay in London's exclusive Savoy Hotel during filming for the talent show.

The £695-a-night bill is being paid out of licence fee money because Sir Tom, 73, is forced to fly to London from his Los Angeles home to film the show, which reaches its climax this Saturday.

Sir Tom has stayed at the hotel for his estimated 21 days of filming and the bill comes out of an £11million budget handed by the BBC to production company Wall to Wall, according to The Sun.

Posh: Welsh singer Sir Tom has been staying in a suite at the Savoy on a 'room only' basis

But while Sir Tom has an agreement with the company for his accommodation to be paid for, fellow judge on the show Will.i.am pays for his own hotel room.

The US star also stays in some of the capital's top hotels, including the Park Lane Hilton.

His hotel bill is to be paid out of his show fee according to his contract.

The former Black Eyed Peas rapper donates his £500,000 fee to the Prince's Trust however, so pays his expenses out of his own pocket.

The Script singer Danny O'Donoghue and Jessie J, also on the judging panel, have homes in London so do not get an accommodation allowance.

According to The Sun, Sir Tom's stay is on a 'room only basis' despite many of the five star hotel's suites coming with a private bar and butler.

A source told the newspaper: 'Tom doesn't have a butler - we're at his beck and call so he doesn't need one.'

Sir Tom is reportedly paid a £300,000 fee for appearing on the show.

A BBC spokesman said that the judges all have separate deals with the production company for the series and that Sir Tom's includes provisions for his accommodation.

Despite looking after its star judges, The Voice has struggled to entice viewers so far this series.

The show was trounced by rival talent staple Britain's Got Talent in the ITV show's final week earlier this month.

While The Voice's first Friday night live show pulled in just 4.21million viewers, BGT peaked at 13.1million during its live final the following night.

Promising viewing figures in the early stages of the first series saw the corporation shell out £22million on a two-year deal for the show.

But even altering the format this series has failed to keep viewers hooked.
