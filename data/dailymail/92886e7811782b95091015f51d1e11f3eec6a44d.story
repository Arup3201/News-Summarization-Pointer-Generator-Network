The Duchess of Cambridge made quite a scene when she joined the England Hockey team for training in her vibrant pink skinny jeans - which went on to sell out - in 2012.

And today, Sophie, Countess of Wessex, attempted to give her fellow Royal a run for her money in the sports stakes.

Sophie paid a visit to the England woman's hockey team at Bisham Abbey, Buckinghamshire and while she wasn't was captain of the 1st 11 at Marlborough College, she still proved she was a good sport as she got involved with a game.

A tale of two hockey stars: Sophie, Countess of Wessex's visit to the England hockey grounds today was reminiscent of the Duchess of Cambridge's back in 2012

Sophie opted for black cropped trousers and a matching black blazer, which she teamed with white trainers and socks.

Despite a lack of sporty attire, 49-year-old Sophie clearly impressed the team.

She was even presented with an England Hockey shirt by men's coach Bobby Crutchley and captain Barry Middleton and ladies' coach Jason Lee and woman's Captain Kate Richardson Walsh.

The Countess, wife of Prince Edward, The Earl of Wessex, has been Royal Patron of England Hockey since 2007 and is also patron of a number of other sports.

HRH will no doubt be keen to see the teams’ progress this summer, as they compete for medals at both the Hockey World Cup in the Netherlands in June, and the Commonwealth Games in Scotland, in August.

Good effort: Wearing slightly less colourful attire than the former Kate Middleton did when she paid a visit to the hockey team, Sophie opted for black cropped trousers and a matching black blazer

During her visit The Countess of Wessex also got involved on the hockey pitch, playing with England player Shona McCallin. She said afterwards: 'I always really enjoyed playing hockey, it’s so much more than just a team sport. Hockey has a great social side and is a thoroughly enjoyable game to both play and watch.'

England Hockey Chief Executive Sally Munday added: 'It was brilliant for both staff and players to enjoy a Royal visit, and The Countess of Wessex is clearly very enthusiastic in her support of hockey.

'Having HRH as our Royal Patron is hugely valuable to our sport. Hockey can be a real inspiration to children across the country, particularly given the recent successes of our National teams, and support from the Royal Family helps us to push that message out.'

The Duchess of Cambridge famously made a private visit to the Olympic Park in Stratford in 2012 to meet the Team GB women's hockey squad.

She asked to meet them in her role as Team GB and Paralympics GB 2012 Ambassador because of her love for the sport.

She was handed a white sleeveless team top with 'Cambridge 1' on the back and a polo style shirt for her husband.

Kate Richardson-Walsh told MailOnline: 'It’s brilliant to have two female ambassadors for our sport who are so high profile and both so interested in our sport, as well as being differing ages. And you can definitely tell they’ve both played before!'

Meanwhile, it has been a busy week for Sophie, Countess of Wessex.

After celebrating her husband's 50th birthday on Monday, the pair paid a visit to Robert Browning 
primary school in Walworth, London to see work carried out by Kidscape, 
one of the charities to receive money from the Wessex Youth Trust, the charity the couple set up shortly before 
their marriage in 1999.

The Wessexes received a warm welcome 
from locals who lined the streets outside the school and gave the couple
 a round of applause as they arrived.

Inside the school, a group of excited children presented Edward with a large card they had made and signed themselves.

On Monday, to mark the occasion of Edward's birthday, Buckingham Palace yesterday 
issued a charming new portrait of the Earl of Wessex, the title he was 
granted on his marriage, his wife, Sophie, the Countess of Wessex and 
their two children The Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and James, 
Viscount Severn.

Taken in in
 the panelled dining room in their Berkshire home, Bagshot Park, by 
photographer Millie Pilkington, who also took the private photographs at
 the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding, it is a particularly 
relaxed family portrait.

Hectic schedule: It's been a busy week for Sophie, who celebrated her husband's 50th earlier this week
