There have been calls for an overhaul of maths education in England after it emerged just one in five pupils continue with the subject beyond GCSE level.

A study has revealed just one in five students in England go on to study maths after the age of 16, in contrast to countries like Germany and Hong Kong, where more than 90 per cent of pupils continue with the subject.

In Singapore, New Zealand and the U.S., over 65 per cent of students persevere with maths.

Low numbers: A study has shown that in England the majority of students choose to drop maths after taking the subject at GCSE level

The Nuffield Foundation, which carried out the research, wants to see a new maths qualification introduced in England for those pupils who do not wish to study the subject at AS or A-level.

The new qualification should focus on mathematical fluency and statistics according to the study, which looked at maths education in seven countries.

It suggests that some students should be given an extra year to prepare for their maths GCSE to ensure they have a good grasp of the subject.

And it says that encouraging teenagers to study a wide range of subjects may be a better way to increase take-up of maths than making it compulsory.

The report argues that New Zealand and Singapore have high levels of pupils taking advanced maths, which is equivalent to AS-level, but it is not compulsory.

Instead, both countries allow students to take a choice of subjects, but require these to cover a range of disciplines.

For example, in Singapore a student studying arts and humanities must also choose a maths or science option.

The report also found that the evidence from Hong Kong, New Zealand and Singapore indicates that the strongest incentive for students to continue studying maths is because they need to do so for higher education or employment.

It also says that universities and employers should ask students planning to study subjects such as teaching and nursing to continue taking maths beyond GCSE.

Report author Professor Jeremy Hodgen said: 'Our study shows the importance of a consensual approach to policy development and implementation.

'Higher education and employers will need to be involved in the development of a new qualification if they are to value it and to make it an entry requirement.

'Schools and colleges may need to be incentivised to offer the new qualification to students, as well as to ensure that existing advanced qualifications maintain their levels of participation.'
