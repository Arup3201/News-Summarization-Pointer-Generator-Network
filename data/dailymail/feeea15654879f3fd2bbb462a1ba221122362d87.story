Halloween has not even gone yet but shoppers are already racing ahead in their preparations for Christmas.

Sales of festive puddings are rocketing 62 per cent ahead of last year, mince pies are up 32 per cent and Christmas chocolate boxes are up 42 per cent.

Advent calendars are also flying off the shelves, with sales running at three times the level of this time last year and sales of Christmas cakes 13 per cent ahead.

Sales of Christmas puddings are running 62 per cent ahead of last year as shoppers rush to get their Christmas goods in early

The figures come from Waitrose but are
likely to be replicated across other stores, which are also stocking 
Christmas foods and  giving away festive carrier bags. In reality, many 
of the Christmas-themed foods have a shelf life which means they must be
eaten weeks before the big day.

The increase in sales seems to have been driven by retailers starting their Christmas sales push  earlier than ever.

Apart from festive food, stores have 
been running toy sales and filling their shelves with ‘three for two’ 
deals on Christmas gifts.

The festive season is make or break 
for many retailers as this is when they make more than 40 per cent of 
annual sales and profits. So, they are under enormous pressure, 
particularly during the current economic climate, to extend the shopping
season.

Newly released figures show that compared with this time last year mince pie sales are up 32 per cent

Tesco began selling Christmas-themed confectionary as early as 
August 29, sparking something of a backlash. Separately, advertising 
watchdogs have received complaints from parents unhappy that early 
marketing is encouraging children to pester them far in advance of 
December 25.

Waitrose began selling Christmas lines
on September 24, which was not long after many families had returned 
from their summer holidays.

The popularity of festive puddings 
when we are only in October may be down to past struggles to keep up 
with demand for the Hidden Orange Christmas Pudding created for the 
chain by award-winning chef Heston Blumenthal. Such was demand that 
people sold  them at a huge mark-up on eBay.

Even Advent calendars are flying off the shelves with sales running at three times the level of this time last year

In previous years Waitrose has found it difficult to keep up with demand for the Hidden Orange Christmas Pudding created for the chain by award-winning chef, Heston Blumenthal

Waitrose retail director, Rob Collins,
confirmed an early start to Christmas shopping by customers. ‘Our sales
reflect a move towards colder weather and the approach of the festive 
season, with many starting to get organised even earlier than usual this
year,’ he said. ‘We are in the two-month countdown to Christmas, and 
people are turning their attention to the festive period.’

He said shoppers seemed to be taking comfort in having festive goodies ‘ready and waiting’ in  the cupboard.

The Advertising Standards Authority 
said that, despite ‘a steady flurry of complaints’ at early festive 
promotions, this was not an area which it regulated.

Sales of Christmas cakes at Waitrose are up by 13 per cent compared to this time last year
