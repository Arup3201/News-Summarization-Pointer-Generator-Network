Acclaimed Australian political historian David Day has urged Malcolm Turnbull to show some guts and take on Tony Abbott.

He challenges Turnbull to 'be more courageous, like Paul Keating' and covet the leadership of the party and country.

Day has penned  his latest instalment on the country's 'most important Labor prime ministers', "Paul Keating The Biography", and told Daily Mail Australia that Turnbull should take a leaf out of Keating's book.

Malcolm Turnbull should look to history, says David Day, and take on Tony Abbott. 'Keating tried and failed but six months later it paid off'

'He (Keating) knew his first challenge (against Bob Hawke) was a big risk but he took it, he was a courageous politician on several fronts, and it showed then,' Day said.

'Turnbull should look to that sort of history, Keating tried and failed .. but six months later it paid off.'

Indeed, Keating put his political career on the line when he challenged Bob Hawke in June of 1991. He was soundly defeated in the party room ballot and took his place on the backbench.

Six months later though, it was a far different story. The man, who had left school at age 14, took over as PM just a week before Christmas, when he defeated Hawke in a second tilt.

But while the former PM refused Day's invitation to play a part in his new book, Day is a fan.

'I take several legacies out of his time in Australian politics,' he said.

'He opened up Australia to the world, he had mostly impressive years as treasurer, put the republic on the agenda and Mabo was perhaps the most important policy on a practical level.'

'Yes he was a divisive figure but I admire many of the things he did.'

Indeed, Day does not resile from his belief that Keating may have suffered dyslexia, a claim to which the former PM took no shortage of umbrage.

He wrote a letter to the SMH on that score saying, in part: 'This is completely untrue.'

Day says Paul Keating's speeches 'were memorable'. Here the former Australian Prime Minister is pictured in 1992 as he prepares to speak at Redfern in Sydney, to mark the International Year of the World's Indigenous People

Keating also took him to task on his marital status.

'Day's book is full of inaccuracies, including that I divorced my wife - which I have not,' he wrote.

The author told DMA: 'I will take his word on the divorce but on the question of dyslexia, I stand by it.'

'He obviously took it badly, in that perhaps it suggests you are a moron but that is not the case at all.

'Winston Churchill and Einstein both were (dyslexic) and the description of someone who is, fits him (Keating) to a tee.

'Just his behaviour, in the way he got his knowledge and how he got his information. For a long time nothing was known about it all but it's not a disability and it helps to explain how he operated, how he could see th ebig picture and how he was able to scane documents and get a gist faster than others.'

Keating did not assist Day with the book and says there are several inaccuracies in the account.

'I tried several times to speak with him but he just said no, he did not want to be involved in the writing of it.'

But that did not diminish his respect for the former Labor leader.

'Keating had been treasurer for nearly nine years, he transformed Australia's economy it's fair to say but he wanted the top job,' Day added.

'He truly wanted Australians to be proud of their country and wanted to lead those changes .. and he did so.'

Even the hand on the Queen's back incident was a non-issue, according to the author.

'I don't think it meant anything to Australians, it was not a concern for them at all, if anything it just made him seem more human, it was just about the Fleet Street reaction, where they went over-the-top calling him "the Lizard of Oz" all that.' 

'His was a formidable (political) career and his speeches were memorable,' Day said.

'This book was particularly gruelling for me, so that delayed the writing of it but I found that there are very different opinions about him.'

'Keating,' Day said, 'was always a reluctant convert to the ascendancy (as leader) of Bob Hawke.

Day recounts how Keating made no secret of, and continues to, the belief he did much of the hard graft for the Hawke Government in the mid-eighties, after the then PM's daughter Rosslyn was 'found to be addicted to heroin'.

'It's a sign of their close relationship that Keating is the one minister in whom Hawke confides,' wrote Day, while noting, it also changed their relationship for the worse.

'Keating's speeches were memorable'. David Day, despite being challenged by the ex-PM over claims in the new book, remains a fan of someone he called 'a divisive figure'

'According to Keating, the shock wrought on Hawke destroys his confidence to such an extent that he takes years to recover, leaving Keating to carry most of the burden of government,' according to Day.

'This leaves a power void, says Keating, "and I filled it". Not surprisingly this is roundly rejected by Hawke.'

Day has now added Keating's account to his 'series of six most important PMs', along with the best-sellers on John Curtin, Andrew Fisher and Ben Chifley - with Bob Hawke and Gough Whitlam still to come to complete the set.

On whether any of the current parliamentarians will ascend to the 'most important' list one day, the author singled out Mark Dreyfus and Anthony Albanese as having the potential to succeed, while adding: 'I thought Tony Abbott would do better than he has.'

Paul Keating shares a joke with Prince Charles. The former PM once famously told the Queen that 'Australians felt the monarchy was an anachronism'

Paul Keating, 71, became Australia's 24th Prime Minister, holding office for more than five years before he was toppled in the 1996 election by John Howard. 

He was treasurer for almost nine years and the floating of the Australian dollar remains one of the pivotal moments of that tenure. Keating would spend almost 27 years in federal politics and Day writes of that time: 'The cost of his single-minded ambition was eating away at his marriage and threatening the relationships that he held most dear.'

'Rather than being lauded for his efforts, Keating was tossed from office at the 1996 election by voters who had become tired of change.

'Spurned by his own part, and with his marriage in tatters, Keating was left lonely and embittered as he watched some of his milestone achievements being dismantled by the new (Howard) government.'
