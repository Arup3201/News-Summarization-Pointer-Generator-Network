Mitt Romney might be working up a sweat on the campaign trail but he looked more than a little awkward when an enthusiastic supporter went to mop his brow during a photo op.

The Republican nominee and wife Ann stopped by the Tin Fish restaurant in Port Saint Lucie, Florida on Sunday for some seafood, when owner Joseph Melluso gave Romney's face a vigorous wipe down with some paper napkins.

Romney laughed hesitantly before leaning back out of the chef's reach, saying: 'Thank you, thank you... you're next. It's a little rainy out there.'

Scrubs up nicely: Joseph Melluso said that Mr Romney was soaked by the rain so he grabbed some paper napkins to mop down his brow

After the picture was taken, Mr Melluso took another glance at the candidate and reached again to remove something from the corner of his lip, to which a startled Romney exclaimed: 'I got it!'

Mr Melluso explained to MailOnline why exactly he decided to wipe down Mr Romney's face.

The Brooklyn native, who owns a chain of Tin Fish restaurants, said: 'It was raining when he came in and he was dripping, so I took a wad of napkins and I dabbed his face.Â 

'I'm a chef and when I'm cooking, my assistants always wipe my face with a towel and I appreciate it.

'Then I noticed there was a piece of 
paper stuck to the corner of his mouth and I thought, ''I don't want to 
have our next president with paper towel on his face.''

Mr Melluso added: 'As soon as she came in the door, Mrs Romney said ''Mitt, that's what I like to eat.'''

The restaurant owner added that although he didn't know Romney well before, he supports his message and would be voting for him come election day.
