Newcastle have revived a deal for Hertha Berlin striker Pierre-Michel Lasogga and hope to get it concluded this week.

The 22-year-old made it clear to his club that he was keen on a move to England after holding a meeting with Hertha Berlin’s general manager Michael Preetz last week.

The belief was he would choose between staying with Hertha or going back on loan to Hamburg where he spent last season.

Firepower: Newcastle boss Alan Pardew hopes to boost his options with a deal for German Lasogga

Cut price: Newcastle owner Mike Ashley is hoping to pay just £7.5m and not the £10m Hertha want

Lasogga scored 13 goals in 20 appearances for Hamburg but he has only one year left on his contract.

Newcastle have been quoted £10million but Lasogga is ready to push for the move and they hope that will help drive down the price to around £7.5m.
