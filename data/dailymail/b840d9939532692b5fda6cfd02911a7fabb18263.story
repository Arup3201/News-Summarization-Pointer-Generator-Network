One month after losing the New York mayoral primary, GQ magazine has published the closest thing to a heartfelt apology from Anthony Weiner.

Weiner's chances at becoming mayor were shot on July 23, when 23-year-old Sydney Leathers released graphic pictures and 'sexts' from married Weiner sent after he stepped down from Congress in 2011 for a similar scandal. Weiner was then, as he is now, married to long-time Hillary Clinton-aide Huma Abdein. The two have a child together, 20-month-old Jordan.

While Weiner has apologized for his behavior before, it wasn't until the interview conducted after the race that he seems to finally realize the pain he heaped on Huma, describing himself as an 'empty soulless vessel'.

Unlike in 2011, Weiner decided to stick out the race and a few days later, reporter Marshall sella started following Weiner on the campaign trail - becoming a witness to his demise. 

During his time with Weiner, the candidate continued to heap blame back on the handling of the scandal, saying that if it weren't for the internet he might have had a shot at winning the whole race.

'Maybe if the internet didn't exist? Like if I was running in 1955? I'd probably get elected mayor,' he said.

But the tone of the story changed a week after losing the election, when Weiner finally opened up and expressed his remorse for hurting wife Huma Abedin, while still maintaining that his sexting was 'meaningless'.

Weiner explained, that to him, sexting women like Leathers was like playing a video game.

'You ask about the higher meaning of sexting, but it was remarkably meaningless. It was almost like a video game you played in that didn't have much connection to reality.'

To further illustrate the point, Weiner mimuics typing on a keyboard: 'Clicky clicky clicky - send! Clicky Clicky send. The intellectual part of my brain was saying, "Why was this so bad?"'

Together: After the second sexting scandal emerged in July, Weiner's wife Huma Abedin continued to stand by her man by saying she forgave him at a press conference

While he may not have been thinking about it at the time, Weiner now recognizes that those actions impacted his wife.

'This weird synapse in my mind fired in a different direction, and I realized "Wait a minute. It's not very significant to me. But it's significant to Huma. It doesn't really matter what I think about it. It kinda matters, the impact it's having on her." And that switch going off made the game no longer interesting. It wasn't like playing Madden! It wasn't like playing an online role-playing game.'

Second chances: While the two haven't been pictured together since Weiner's primary loss, they are reportedly still living together in their Central Park South apartment

Despite the hurt he caused her, wife Huma has seemingly stood by her husband this second scandal and even after losing the election - despite rumors that she has been told to dump him if she wants to work on Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.

'We've had a very rough time,' Weiner said. 'It causes me a great deal of pain in the way she gets reported and the way she gets discussed. Her treatment in the press has been rough. It pains me because I deserve it. She doesn't.

'I duck it as best as I can. But her reputation has come the Woman Who Married an Idiot and Stuck with Him. More of it rolls of my back, because that's the way I am constitutionally. She's more sensitive. I'm just an empty soulless vessel, so it doesn't hurt me as much.'

Still, Weiner wouldn't directly answer the question of whether or not the two would be sticking together after his second betrayal, brushing off the question with a critique of the media's curiosity about his personal life.

Lost: Weiner told GQ that if it weren't for the internet, he probably would have been elected mayor

'She'd stay with me if I broke twenty points! And actually if I made the runoff, she'd recommit the vows, in a Hawaii vacation. If I won, she'd have a second child with me! I don't know how people think,' he said.

Sella ends the conversation by asking Weiner if he would still run for mayor, if given the opportunity to go back and do it all over again. While Weiner defended his run throughout the race, after losing he makes a more realistic statement.

'If I could go back? If you tell me I'm gonna get 5 per cent, you tell me how I'd answer that question. The process I went through to decide to run was the right one; the way I talked about sexting was...not right.'
