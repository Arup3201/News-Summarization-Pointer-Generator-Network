A health and safety expert was too ill too drive when he blacked out at the wheel and smashed into a bright A-Level student's car, a High Court judge has ruled.

Peter Haynes will have to pay substantial damages to 19-year-old Simon Green, who was left with a permanent brain injury after the horror crash on the A11 in Norfolk.

Mr Haynes, 56, told London's High Court he was not to blame because he was in a state of 'automatism', similar to sleepwalking, after abdominal pain caused him to pass out.

But today Mr Justice Supperstone ruled Mr Haynes was liable for the crash, because he should not have driven once he realised he was ill.

The businessman, of Metfield, Suffolk, was on his way home from a conference in Norwich in March 2012 when he passed out  on a slip road to the dual carriageway near the village of Cringleford.

The self-employed health and safety consultant's Toyota Land Cruiser hit the rear of student Mr Green's Volkswagen Polo, shunting it under the Land Rover in front.

Mr Green, a high-achieving A-level student, suffered life-changing brain damage in the crash and it was 'remarkable' that he survived at all, the case heard.

He launched a civil case to reclaim damages from the health and safety expert, insisting he was responsible for causing the pile-up.

Mr Green sued Mr Haynes at the High Court (pictured), where he relied on the rare defence of automatism

People claiming 'automatism' - where they had no control over their actions through no fault of their own - has made headlines after defendants accused of sex offences claimed they acted in their sleep.

It has its origins in 19th Century definitions of 'insanity' but now stands as a separate defence for people with no mental health issues.

The defence is wide-ranging and open-ended - it can include sleep disorders or medical conditions such as an epileptic fit or a hypoglycaemic attack.

In one criminal case in August, a driver was acquitted after a jury heard he caused a crash which killed a married couple because he was choking on a sweet. Other examples could include a swarm of bees flying into a car.

The defence is almost completely unheard of in civil cases, however. One person involved in Mr Haynes' case said it the first example he had seen in more than 20 years.

There are no statistics on how often the defence is pleaded or succeeds, and last year Parliament's Law Commission said it should be scrapped in criminal cases altogether.

The five-strong panel led by Lord Justice Lloyd Jones said the wording should be changed to 'not criminally responsible by reason of recognised medical condition', making the law less open to interpretation. 

In his defence, Mr Haynes said the crash occurred after he had a blackout triggered by abdominal pain and he was in a state of 'automatism', meaning he was carrying out actions over which he had no control.

Lawyers for Mr Green accepted that Mr Haynes passed out seconds before the collision - but said he was negligent in choosing to drive when he did, and and in the manner of his driving.

The judge said Mr Haynes had felt very unwell with an upset stomach when he was still at the conference and rang his wife, asking her to make him a doctor's appointment.

But he still decided to drive home, and 'in all likelihood' drove close to 70mph in the outside lane which would have made it more difficult to pull over.

Had he been driving slowly and in the inside lane, ready to pull over, the accident would have been avoided. 

The judge said: 'In my judgment, having regard to the true state of the defendant's health when he left the conference centre, he should have appreciated the risk of his condition getting worse and that, if it did, his judgment and ability to drive was likely to be impaired.

'On a balance of probabilities, I find that the defendant should not have driven on leaving the conference centre after he felt so unwell, and that he was in breach of his duty to other road users in so doing.' 

The amount of damages to be awarded to Mr Green, now 22, of Swaffham, Norfolk, will be assessed at a later date.

There was no mention in court of whether Mr Haynes ever faced a criminal investigation.
