Belgium were knocked out of the World Cup in their quarter-final encounter against Argentina on July 5 - which meant the likes of Lukaku, Thibaut Courtois and Eden Hazard were given an extended break.

Lukaku, who scored 15 league goals for Everton last season, is not expected to join up with the rest of Chelsea's squad until July 30.

However Lukaku's future at Stamford Bridge is yet to be resolved with Everton keen on signing their former loanee on a permanent deal.

The 21-year-old will face competition from Diego Costa, Fernando Torres and maybe even club legend Didier Drogba if he does decide to stay at the west London outfit.

Decision maker: Jose Mourinho must decide whether Lukaku has a future at the club
