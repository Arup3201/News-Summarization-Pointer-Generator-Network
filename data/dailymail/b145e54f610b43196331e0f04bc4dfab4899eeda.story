A hiker has been killed by a black bear after it confronted his group of friends - forcing them to scatter in different directions.

Police identified the body  as that of  Darsh Patel, who had been hiking with four friends on Sunday when the bear began following them in the 526-acre wooded Apshawa Preserve.

The 300-pound animal, which authorities say was likely looking for food, continued to stalk them through the woods, causing them to become frightened and run off in separate directions.

When four of them regrouped around 3.45pm, they realized 22-year-old Patel was not with them and they called police.

Patel's body was found two hours later.

'Evidence at the scene indicated that the victim had been attacked by a bear,' West Milford Police Chief Timothy C. Storbeck said.

Police say that a bear was found circling the body and wouldn't leave even after officers tried to scare it away by making loud noises and throwing sticks and stones. It was killed with two rifle blasts.

The bear's body is being examined at a state lab for more clues as to why it may have pursued the group, a spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Protection said.

Kelcey Burguess, principal biologist and leader of the state Division of Fish and Wildlife's black bear project, said the bear could have been predisposed to attack but more likely was looking for food.

Wildlife officials believe there is a current shortage of the acorns and berries that bears eat. The hikers had granola bars and water with them, Storbeck said. 

Officials don't believe the hikers provoked the bear but they may have showed their inexperience when they decided to run.

The safest way to handle a bear encounter is to move slowly and not look the bear in the eye, DEP spokesman Larry Ragonese said.

New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife guidelines direct law enforcement to euthanize 'Category I' bears, which are deemed an 'immediate threat to human safety.'

NJ Advance Media reports that the New Jersey State Medical Examiner, the Fish and Wildlife Division of the state Department of Environmental Protection and the West Milford Police Department are looking into the circumstances of Patel's death.

'Bear sightings are not unusual by any stretch in New Jersey,' said Bob Considine, spokesperson for the Department of Environmental Protection. 

'They have been seen in all 21 counties, although they’re obviously most common in the northwest part of the state.'

Black bears rarely pose a threat to humans and often retreat when confronted.

In 2006, a tabby cat scared a black bear up a tree in West Milford. The bear only climbed down and left after the cat's owner had called it back into the house.
