They say there is nowhere quite like New England in the fall.

But old England is giving the U.S. a run for its money this year, with the trees around the Lake District transformed by the changing season into a glorious tapestry of green, red, copper and gold.

And with forecasters predicting unseasonably warm weather on its way in the UK this week, conditions will be perfect for those hoping to get outdoors to take in the breathtaking autumn scenery.

These spectacular pictures show how 
the leaves on the trees surrounding Derwentwater in the Lake District 
have deepened to warm russet hues, forming a stunning backdrop to the 
placid waters of the lake.

They
 show a picture-perfect autumn day for hikers and sailors in the area, 
and the Met Office has said temperatures could soar as high as 20C this 
week thanks to a wave of hot air from North Africa which is due to sweep
 through the UK from tomorrow.

Continuing
 this year's pattern of wacky weather, it could also bring 'blood rain' 
to our shores - rain carrying red dust from the Sahara desert.

But the mild conditions are not expected to last, with snow predicted for the end of the week.

Freezing
 arctic winds are set to send temperatures plummeting at the end of the 
week, with snow forecast in the north of England and Scotland by next 
weekend.

The Met Weather Office said London 
and the south east will enjoy the hottest weather with temperatures 
soaring to a very warm 20 degrees centigrade on Monday and Tuesday, 
provided cloud lifts.

The
 rest of England and Wales will also enjoy the warm spell with 
temperatures hovering in the mid teens, although forecasters say it will
 stay cloudy.

The Met Office described how rain carrying dust from the Sahara stains cars when it falls.

'Where
 there has been rain in the southeast there has been red dust brought 
down with it. When the rain dries off it leaves a red residue,' a 
spokeswoman said.

'This could last until the early part of the week.'

Temperatures are then likely to plummet to around 8C in the Midlands and 6C in Scotland.

Meteogroup forecaster Brendan Jones said: 'The warm weather is being brought in on a wind from France and it has been 25C (77F) to 26C (79F) there this weekend.

'Some of that warm air is going to try to cross the Channel on Monday and Tuesday, but it is going to struggle to get further than the South East.

'If the sun comes out we could see an extension of the Indian summer that is being seen on the Continent.'

This
 year has already brought some of the most bizarre weather ever seen in 
this country, with the worst drought since 1976 followed by the wettest 
summer for a century.

The weather is expected to dry up as temperatures nosedive during the week, dropping to 6C (43F) by the weekend.

In Devon the arrival of autumn brought with it the traditional World Bolving championships, held on Exmoor over the weekend.

Bolving is the deep-throated unique to red deer stags during the rutting season.

The call is designed to frighten off other stags leaving the hinds - females - to the individual stag for mating.

Contestants in the World Bolving championships have to roar - or bolve - across a large valley in the hope of getting a stag to bolve back, which scores points with the judges.

Over one hundred and fifty nature lovers gathered at Draydon Rails to see the ninth annual contest in aid of the Devon Air Ambulance Trust.

Previous winner, Richard Eales, who now organises the event, said the contest started life as a bet among locals in the Rock Inn pub over who could get a stag to call back.

Last year's winner Elvis Afanasenko, who lives on the moor, retained his world champion title at the weekend.

Bolving was traditionally used across Europe to hunt deer who were a problem to farmers, but difficult to locate. A good call attracted the stags and made them easier to find.
