Emma Bridgewater at home in Oxford

Quintessentially British pottery designer Emma Bridgewater has revealed how in her darkest moments - following the horse-riding accident that left her mother severely brain-damaged aged 53 - she would go to the cinema alone and drink neat vodka to numb the pain.

The mother-of-four, whose pretty polka-dot teapots and plates speckled with little pink hearts are stocked in middle class kitchens all over the country, says she used the fiction of film and theatre as an escape.

Speaking in a new book by ad-man Charles Vallance titled The Branded Gentry: How A New Era of Entrepreneurs Made Their Names, Bridgewater - who founded her eponymous earthenware company based in Stoke-on-Trent in 1985, and in 2011 turned over £15m of profit -says: 'I've built a switch-off mechanism, otherwise I'm not sure I'd have survived.

'I can remember the horror of sleepless nights I've had. Sometimes, you have to sort of use an escape like fiction; theatre is very good; cinema is brilliant; cinema and alcohol are very, very effective.

'I can remember going to see Gosford Park, at a very hard time, sitting in the front row having had two large vodkas, feeling absolutely no pain at all.'

Bridgewater, 51, who was one of eight siblings and now has Elizabeth, Kitty, Margaret and Michael with designer husband Matthew Rice, continues: 'I think a tragedy like this fires you up. I don't exactly understand why, but in some strange, probably quite simple way, what you're doing in your career, you're doing it for her.

'It's often unfocused and there can be anger, but there's a real longing to put it right - even though you can't really.'

Bridgewater discusses the stress of having to put her mother into care while juggling two young children and a business, and how when she turned 40 she was on the verge of a breakdown.

Emma Bridgewater began designing earthenware when she was looking for a birthday present for her mother but couldn't find any designs she liked

She says: 'Whatever it was, I was 
exhausted. And I started finding the work pretty ghastly... And lonely. 
But then you think that it's very selfish on the other people who are 
struggling for me to be failing on not one, but two counts: the business
isn't growing and I'm personally finding it exhausting as well.

'You feel there must be something 
very badly wrong with you personally. You've got to be ready to admit 
that things have to give. It's a little bit like making your house look 
impeccable for a magazine, which I've always been very careful not to 
do.

'You can make yourself extremely 
miserable trying to do everything perfectly. No one is perfect, but 
women get forced into thinking they have to be.'

Bridgewater developed rheumatoid arthritis which left her incapacitated, and was told she would only rid herself of it when she cut the stress out of her life, so Matthew began helping wit0 the company's administrative work.

'I think he'd seen how tough it had been for me,' she says. 'But it 
turned out that he could do it just as well as me; better in fact. I'd 
tripled the size of the business and then he more than doubled.'

Explaining how her childhood influence her business, Bridgewater says: 'I think that the brand is very informal and I think that, luckily, I am as well.

'I think it's what my mum was. Mum's influence is very pervasive; strangely, probably more in the business than in my family life.

'I feel that I'm trying to capture the spirit of what she made my home life like as a child; what was unusual and special about it. And then turn that into a business. It’s a strange thing to want to do really, isn't it?

'Mum is still alive, so I can't mourn her because she's alive, but I want to explain her. I sort of feel that when we get this business right - in any aspect of the business - it's explaining her and what she stood for. And that feels very necessary - strangely.'

MONEY

'Although my parents and stepfather 
were always generous, I think I inherited a bit of angst about money 
from my grandparents: not having quite enough, living tight, feeling 
worried.

However, once you start to make what once might have seemed a 
lot of money, it brings its own new set of hideous responsibilities.

In 
Matthew and I, you just couldn't find a couple who have less desire to 
stay in fancy resorts or hotels or drive fast cars.

For him, money means
land to do something beautiful with; to me, it's about trying to make 
some lovely things happen here.

And do funny things: like, I have a 
sister with learning difficulties and it's her birthday next week, so 
I'm hiring a pink stretch Limo to collect her and take her to the 
circus.

I just like to do stupid things like that. It only cost a few 
hundred quid, but it's what mum couldn't have done because she was 
always careful with money.'

BRITISH DESIGN

'In this country, we're still not 
training enough engineers or investing enough in design and we're being 
overlapped by the rest of the world.

If I had my way, I'd like all 
children to go round factories while still at primary school. We do 
bring quite a few in here, but not enough.'

HER NEW PROJECT

'We've bought the site of Bampton 
Castle, but all that's left is a shard and ruins. It's a beautiful place
in a lovely, funny, mad village, obsessed with Morris dancing.

I've 
increasingly realised, when you lift the carpet of Metropolitan 
silliness, even in the soft South of England, that there's still lots of
real life going on in Britain, and this is an example; another really 
strange and interesting connection we've been able to make with a very 
rural community.'
