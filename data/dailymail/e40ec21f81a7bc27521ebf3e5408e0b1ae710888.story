Women chasing the latest celebrity body trends can eat again: strong is the new skinny and sensible women are shunning teeny tiny tummies and matchstick legs in favour of tightly packed abs and well-toned arms.

Clued-up celebrities are leading the way, ripping up the size zero rulebook and flying the fitness flag instead.

The happy and healthy stars of the cinema, catwalk and tennis court have been hitting beaches all over the world showing off their gym-honed curves and proving you don't need to be beanpole thin to look fabulous this summer.
