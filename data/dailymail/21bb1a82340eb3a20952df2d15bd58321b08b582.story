When a photographer decided to get a close up of a praying mantis in his back garden, he didn’t think he’d be bugging it.

Nathan Ziegler spotted the insect cleverly disguised among the leaves in his family’s yard in Oregon, US, and decided to take a closer look with a video camera.

But in a scene that could be straight out of Predator, the Eighties alien horror movie, the angry insect dives onto the camera in a flash and wrestles with it.

You can hear the praying mantis grappling furiously with the device before Mr Ziegler dropped it with a mixture of horror and surprise.

His family can be heard squealing in the background before descending into giggles at their terrified reaction.

As the family recovers, a woman can be heard in the background saying: 'Yeah, I jumped.'

Predator: The praying mantis did not like it when Nathan Ziegler took a close up on his video camera and launched an aggressive attack causing him to drop the device

Praying 
mantis are not known to be particularly docile insects; the female is 
famous for eating her mate just after – or even during – reproduction.

Moths, crickets, grasshoppers and flies are also on the menu.

But
 this time it seems the mantis was none too impressed with the camera 
and scuttled off into the bush in search of tastier treats.
