Watford striker Odion Ighalo is the hottest property in English football since the turn of the year and is driving the his side towards the Premier League.

The striker has scored 13 goals in nine games in 2015 as Slavisa Jokanovic’s men remain in the top six and in the hunt for a return to the Premier League.

He has scored more goals this year than both Harry Kane and Danny Ings and is the top scorer in all four professional divisions in England in 2015.

Ighalo has scored 13 goals in 2015 - the highest in English football

Ighalo netted just four goals up until December 28 but has really found a rich vein of form since then.

The 25-year-old was born in Lagos and began his career in Nigeria before moving to Watford’s partner club Udinese in 2008. His first real break came when he moved to Spain with Granada – who also have links with Watford – and he scored 35 goals over two loan spells.

Ighalo joined Watford initially on loan at the beginning of the season before making the deal permanent in October.

His nine goals this year – including four against Blackpool and two apiece against Charlton, Brentford and Rotherham – have attracted interest.

Ighalo scored just four goals in the first half of the season - but has bagged 13 since the turn of the year

Watford manager Slavisa Jokanovic is keen to put the emphasis on the team rather than individuals 

But manager Jokanovic is not keen to heap praise on any individual.

Speaking earlier this month, he said: ‘There is no memory in football - this game is already history and so is his [Odion Ighalo] part in it.

‘Ighalo is just doing his job - he is in a good moment.

‘The team won the match, not just one player. They will see his name first but behind are many others.’
