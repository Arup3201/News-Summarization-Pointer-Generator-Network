Raving is no longer the preserve of midnight revellers fuelled by drugs and alcohol. Now the fitness pack has taken over the concept to help people get high on endorphins as they burn the calories to techno dance tracks.

The latest fitness rave has been organised by Morning Glory, who helped hundreds 'rave your way into the day' in London's Shoreditch this morning.

Starting at 6.30am, participants danced free-style to the tunes played by DJs at the underground venue.

Sweat in the City: The event attracted numerous office workers who had a workout before starting business

Dance to the beat: The club style workout is growing in popularity

As previously reported in the MailOnline, the invigorating 
pre-breakfast dance event has been created by events producer Samantha Moyo and bodywork 
therapist Nico Thoemmes and is aimed at people looking for an alternative 
way to keep fit in the morning.

They said: 'It
 was free-form exercise. It came from the idea that people go to 
aerobics or the gym in the morning, and this is like that without it 
being structured.

Free-style: Participants don't follow a set routine but make up their own moves

Smiles all around: The class got the thumbs up from those who took part

Like clubbing, but healthier: There was no alcohol but water and smoothies were available to drink

'It's 
like clubbing, but instead of crawling out into the darkness afterwards 
feeling horrible, you go to work feeling great. And instead of having a 
beer you have coffee, a croissant and a massage.'

According the the company's website, the class attracts 'a diverse crowd of city workers, media folk, artists, dancers and anyone up for a damn good Wednesday!'

The class, which costs £10 in advance or £12 on the door, starts at 6.30 and runs until 10.30am. As well as working out by dancing, attendees can also get their weary muscles treated with a sports massage, refuel with a smoothie and get a caffeine hit to help them through the rest of the morning at their coffee bar.
