Â A former Northern California transit officer cried on the 
witness stand Friday while describing how he shot and killed an unarmed 
man on a train station platform in Oakland, California more than five years ago.

Johannes
 Mehserle testified in federal court in San Francisco that he meant to 
use his Taser rather than his gun to subdue Oscar Grant III on New Year's 
Day in 2009.

Mehserle was testifying in a 
civil rights lawsuit filed by Grant's father against Mehserle, the Bay 
Area Rapid Transit agency and other defendants.

The
 shooting occurred as authorities were responding to a chaotic scene on a
 train platform. Police detained individuals believed to be involved in a fight, including Grant, at Fruitvale Station, in Oakland.

Mehserle, who was in the process of arresting Grant, pulled out his gun while Grant was lying on the ground and shot him in the back. According to Mehserle at the time, he had mistaken the dark service revolver for his Taser.

The incident sparked racial tension because Mehserle is white
 and the 22-year-old Grant was black. In a 2013 ruling in the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, fault in the case was placed on both Mehserle and his colleague Anthony Pirone, who was the lead officer at the scene and had ordered Mehserle to arrest Grant and another person.

'Pirone encountered a group of black men who were doing nothing but 
talking when he arrived' said Judge Mary Murguia in the ruling.

Mehserle
 denied Friday that race or animus had anything to do with the shooting.
 He said he wasn't angry while trying to arrest Grant and is still 
confused about why he pulled his gun instead of his Taser.

"I'm still trying to process everything," Mehserle said. "How did this happen?"

Mehserle cried when he recalled seeing a bullet hole in Grant's back and realizing he had shot the suspect.

"I wasn't trying to shoot him," Mehserle said.

Mehserle
 quit the BART police department a week after the shooting. He was later
 convicted of involuntary manslaughter and served about half of his 
two-year sentence in a Los Angeles County jail.

The shooting incident was the subject of the 2013 movie Fruitvale Station, which starred Michael B. Jordan in the role of Oscar Grant III. Despite some criticism about the accuracy of the film's portrayal of the events surrounding the shooting, the film was largely praised and won many awards, including awards at the Cannes Film Festival and 2013 Sundance Film Festival.

Fruitvale Station was released to near-unanimous critical acclaim and numerous film-making awards. However, some people criticized the film's presentation of the facts of the incident

The
 father of the victim, Oscar Grant Jr., is seeking unspecified damages in the lawsuit. He is 
currently serving a life sentence in state prison after being convicted 
of a 1985 killing. Two California Department of Corrections and 
Rehabilitation guards escort him to court each day.

BART
 settled a separate lawsuit filed by Grant's mother and daughter for $2.
 8 million. Another civil case filed by friends of Grant who were 
present on the train platform was settled for $175,000
