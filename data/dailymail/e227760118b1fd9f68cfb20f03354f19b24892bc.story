Beyoncé is the celebrity most women want to look like when they hit the town for a big night out, according to a new survey which was conducted to unearth the habits of female party goers across the UK.

The ‘Crazy in Love’ singer emerged as a clear winner, topping the charts in almost every major city across the UK, including London, Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol and Cardiff.

The results show that women are aspiring to 
look like celebrities such as Beyoncé, Cheryl Cole and Rihanna, who promote a 
curvier, more natural look while still maintaining high glamour and sex 
appeal.

The ideal for a Saturday night: Women aspire to celebrities such as Beyonce, Cheryl Cole, Kim Kardashian and Rihanna, who promote a curvier more natural look

Beyonce Knowles effortlessly mixes glamour and sex appeal to get her look - said to be the most envied by British women getting ready for a night

Surprisingly the overall findings 
discovered that women take longer to achieve the 
more natural look.

The survey, which had more than 
500,000 participants, aimed to find out the importance of a Saturday 
night out and the 'getting ready' rituals of Britain’s female shoppers as 
well as their beauty ideals and favourite celebrities.

Results also found that the dream outfit for a Saturday night out was the same for both the 16-20 age group and those aged 40 and above.

Bodycon, tight and figure flattering dresses including the perennial LBD came out on top, with a need to feel sexy and glamorous key for women of all ages and body shapes.

Norwich, quite literally, stood out from the crowd with 67 per cent of women preferring to totter around the town in six inch heels, two inches above the national mainstream of four inches.

And it was the Norfolk contingent that came out on top again  when it comes to the length of time needed to get ready for the weekly night out.

A fashion-mad 67 per cent said it takes them all week to plan their Saturday night outfit, the highest in the country and Republic of Ireland combined.

The survey also revealed regional gems such as York ladies love of dark tan, and Aberdeen's party loving attitude

In Plymouth 90 per cent of women said that they always buy a new outfit for a night out with 50 per cent of these women willing to spend more than £91 on their big night out. Surprisingly, Plymouth women take the least amount of time getting ready with 50 per cent throwing it together between 30 minutes to an hour.

Only a handful of cities ventured into the two to three hour zone of getting ready - women in Scotland’s capital, Edinburgh, spend the most time getting ready, with 80 per cent spending two to three hours pampering before they leave the house.

The survey, by fast fashion online retailer fusefashion.com, did unearth some regional gems, perhaps most tellingly with shades of fake tan, which grow considerably darker the further north you venture, with women in York being the queens of fake tan with more than 40 per cent saying they wear a ‘dark’ shade.

Newcastle came on top of being the most fake city in the UK being the only city to record having fake lips, breasts, hair, nails, eyelashes and tan together. Nottingham and London also recorded fake breasts.
