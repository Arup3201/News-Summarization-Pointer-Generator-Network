Thrill-seeking campers with a head for heights can now pitch their tents at the world's most extreme 'campsite' - 500ft up a sheer mountain face.

Daredevils pay an eye-watering £750 - the same price as a suite at The Ritz - to spend the night suspended in the air on a small platform halfway up a mountain.

The accommodation comes in the form of a 'portaledge' - an incredibly strong yet lightweight reinforced aluminum frame covered in canvas.

Ultimate thrill-seekers' camping: Suspended 500ft above the ground on a canvass and aluminium ledge, thsi new experience in Germany is only for the fearless

The two-man platforms are hauled up the cliff face in the German Alps and secured to the rock using high strength climbing ropes and shackles.

Campers have to scale the mountain to get to their bed for the night - and can only bring with them the bare essentials of a sleeping bag, a rope and a basic dinner.

Fearless adventurers sleep alongside an instructor, who takes up the outside position just inches from the 500ft sheer drop.

The two campers wear a safety harness to stop them falling should they roll off the portaledge in their sleep.

Guests pay premium prices to get the opportunity to watch the sun set and rise from such a perilous position

Effort: Campers have to scale the mountain to get to their bed for the night - and can only bring with them the bare essentials of a sleeping bag, a rope and a basic dinner

The extreme camping experience is the brainchild of staff at Waldseilgarten-Hollschlucht, an outdoor activity centre in Pfronten, Bavaria.

Included in the price is a day's climbing tuition by the centre's expert staff.

The Waldseilgarten also offers a tree-top package where campers can sleep on portaledges dangling from the branches of giant beech trees or wooden platforms suspended above the ground.

Robin Currie, a climbing expert and guide at Waldseilgarten, said there are three types of camping experiences on offer at the Waldseilgarten.

'With all of our camping you sleep in your harness for safety,' he said. 't would be pretty hard to roll off the edge of the platforms but if you did, you wouldn't fall far.'

The first experience is on wooden platforms that are suspended above the ground, and is for beginners.

There is also the chance to opt for a less scary, tree hanging ledge

When the weather is clear, the views are spectacular, although the ledges can swing rather a lot in the wind

Then there's the 'exposed' tree-top 
camping, he said, where guests can sleep on a portaledge dangling 20ft 
above the ground from the branch of a big beech tree in a forest 
overlooking mountains.

'You can only get to the portaledge by climbing up a rope that hangs down from underneath it - so getting into bed is part of the challenge.

'The sleeping platform is pretty exposed - if it's windy, it will sway in the breeze,' warned Mr Currie.

But he said the final option, known as the Big Wall, is the 'most extreme, and only for the most hardcore thrill-seekers'.

'As part of the ultimate experience you climb halfway up a mountain then pitch a portaledge right there on the face.

Don't look down: These bizarre lodgings are not suitable for those with vertigo

But with those with a head for heights, they get to see the beautiful German Alps from a unique perspective

'You're as high as 500ft and you're completely exposed to all the elements - we call it "camping in the air".

'The beauty is you don't have to be an experienced climber to take part, but you really do need a head for heights.

'It is without a doubt the most extreme form of camping you could possibly do.

'There's no-one else in the world offering this kind of camping experience - we are unique.

'It's certainly not cheap but it is an once-in-a-lifetime experience you will never forget.'
