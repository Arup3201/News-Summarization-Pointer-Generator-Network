The Queen 'will be proud' to be the head of state for an independent Scotland, Alex Salmond claimed today.

The First Minister said he had an audience at Balmoral Castle two weeks ago but would not reveal what was discussed.

Speaking in Edinburgh today he dismissed press reports that the Queen is ‘concerned’ about the prospect of Scottish independence, adding: ‘I want the Queen as head of state, as Queen of Scots of an independent Scotland as her ancestors were.

‘I think Her Majesty the Queen, who has seen so many events in the course of her long reign, will be proud to be Queen of Scots, and indeed we would be proud to have her as monarch of this land.’

It came after Prince William urged voters to concentrate on important 'domestic news' following yesterday's revelation that his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, was pregnant.

David Cameron is under pressure to ask the Queen to intervene in support of the Union as polls show support for both the Yes and No campaigns for Scottish Independence is locked at 50 per cent

David Cameron is under pressure to ask
 the Queen to intervene in support of the Union as polls show support 
for both the Yes and No campaigns for Scottish Independence is locked at
 50 per cent.

Senior MPs 
from all parties have said that the Prime Minister should consider 
asking the Queen to speak out against breaking up the union.

She
 has until now maintained an absolute silence on the issue of 
independence. The nearest she has come to passing comment was in her 
1977 Silver Jubilee speech, delivered as Scotland
 and Wales were voting on devolved national assemblies.

In the address she reminded subjects of the 'benefits which union has 
conferred, at home and in our international dealings, on the inhabitants
 of all parts of the United Kingdom.'

Mr Salmond said he had an audience with the Queen at Balmoral two weeks ago and praised the Palace's neutrality.

He said: 
‘And I think the statement from the Palace about the Queen's neutrality 
in this matter is a perfectly satisfactory and perfectly sensible one.

‘And,
 of course, one thing that the polls showed at the weekend, in addition 
to the substantial move to the Yes campaign, is the enthusiasm of the 
people of Scotland to have Her Majesty the Queen as our Queen of Scots.’

Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond today insisted the Queen would be 'proud' to be the head of state for an independent Scotland

A senior Tory MP told The Telegraph: 'Now would be a great moment for the Queen to say again and underline those inspiring words that she gave in 1977 at her Silver Jubilee. The referendum looks extremely close and her intervention could make all the difference.'

Although
 the Queen is assumed to back the union, under her constitutional role 
she must stay politically neutral and such an intervention would be highly unlikely and constitutionally unthinkable, according to palace sources.

In the speech she said: ‘I 
number kings and queens of England and of Scotland, and princes of Wales
 among my ancestors and so I can readily understand these aspirations.

‘But I cannot forget that I was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

‘Perhaps
 this jubilee is a time to remind ourselves of the benefits which union 
has conferred, at home and in our international dealings, on the 
inhabitants of all parts of this United Kingdom.’

The Queen is the most Scottish sovereign in the history of the United Kingdom, directly descended from Mary Queen of Scots, while the late Queen Mother - daughter of the Earl of Strathmore - was twice descended from Robert the Bruce.

Senior MPs from all parties have said that the Prime Minister should consider asking the Queen to speak out against breaking up the union

Her love of Scotland is also widely documented. She spent much of her childhood there, her late sister Margaret was born there, and those close to the Queen note that she is 'never happier than when at Balmoral'.

Mary Macleod, a former policy adviser to the queen and now a Conservative MP, said
 it was the place where the royals had time to switch off from their 
official duties.

'It is where they relax, it goes back to their childhood.'

Her only official comment on the referendum came in May in a message to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.

'In this important year of referendum, we pray that whatever the outcome, people of faith and people of good will, will work together for the social good of Scotland,' she said.

She is, however, said to be privately concerned at the surge in support for Scottish independence and is said to have asked aides for daily updates on the progress of the campaign. 

A senior royal 
source claimed: ‘The Queen is a unionist... There is now a great deal of
 concern.’

The source added: ‘If there is a ‘yes’ vote, that puts us 
into uncharted territory constitutionally. Nothing is certain. Her being
 Queen of Scotland is not a given.’

Senior
 palace aides are increasingly concerned that the Queen will be thrown 
into the centre of a constitutional crisis in the event of a ‘Yes’ vote 
on September 18.

Although the Queen is assumed to back the union, under her constitutional role she must stay politically neutral and palace sources say that a speech similar to that delivered in 1977 would be constitutionally unthinkable today

Experts have suggested she may be forced to appoint an Australian-style ‘governor general’ to rule in her name.

Scottish Nationalist leader Alex Salmond has insisted that the Queen will remain head of state in an independent Scotland.

But his party is split on the issue. The SNP’s John Mason has called for a referendum to replace the monarch as head of state in Scotland after the Queen steps down or dies.

He said: ‘The present queen is very popular, but the mood of society may change when she leaves the throne.’

Scotland Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill has also raised the prospect this year of a referendum on the Royals. He said it was ‘for the people of Scotland to decide’ on the Queen’s role.

Prime
 Minister David Cameron is currently with the Queen in Balmoral, 
Aberdeenshire, and is expected to hold talks over the crisis.

Mr Cameron has travelled alone without his wife Samantha.

As news broke yesterday that the Duchess of Cambridge is expecting again, Prince William  suggested the growing threat of Scottish independence was more important than the news of his wife's pregnancy.

The Duke said Kate, who is suffering acute morning sickness, was ‘feeling okay’ after a ‘tricky few days’.

But in a move that could be seen as a direct Royal intervention on the independence debate, he added: ‘It’s important that we all focus on the big news and the big international and domestic things that are going on at the moment. That’s what my thoughts are at the moment.’
