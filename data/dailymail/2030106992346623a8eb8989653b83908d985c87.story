The son of tennis champ John McEnroe and actress Tatum O'Neal was arrested on Tuesday night after cops busted him in the middle of a drug deal in Manhattan's East Village.

Police officers stopped Kevin McEnroe, 28, on the corner of East 4th Street and Avenue A at around 11:30pm buying drugs from 22-year-old Niro Meneses. Among the drugs cops found on McEnroe were six bags of cocaine, 20 oxy pills, 10 morphine pills and one anxiety pill, sources told the New York Post.

Kevin was arraigned in court Wednesday on charges of criminal possession of a controlled substance, and released without bail. He was pictured leaving court, trying to cover his face, with neither parent in sight.

Meneses, who lives on the Upper West Side, was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell.

His mother allegedly called the 9th Precinct station after his arrest. O'Neal herself has admitted to battling drug addition since the age of 14.

She and McEnroe got divorced in 1994 and four years later he took custody of their children when she fell back into heroin abuse. 

In 2008, O'Neal was arrested on the 
Lower East Side trying to buy crack cocaine near her apartment.  At the 
time, she told a judge she planned to kick drugs for good.

'I'm
 going back to my meetings and back to my life,' O'Neal said then. She 
plead guilty to disorderly conduct and spent two half-days sessions in 
drug treatment.

O'Neal and McEnroe have two other children together, son Sean, 27, and daughter Emily, 23.

Emily posted a somber tweet Wednesday, after her brother's arrest saying: 'There was a time I I used to think you're either living or dying. Living was doing whatever you wanted. Dying was everything else.'

McEnroe married rock singer Patty Smyth in 1997 and the couple have daughters Anna, 18, and Ava, 15, together. McEnroe is also stepfather to Smyth's 28-year-old daughter Ruby, who she had with ex-husband musician Richard Hell.

Kevin allegedly lives in Brooklyn and once worked as a bartender at the now-closed bar Broadway East, the New York Daily News reports.

According to his Facebook profile, Kevin attended Trinity School, a $44,000 New York prep school, before attending Skidmore and then Columbia University.

His father won Wimbledon three times and the US Open four times, but was known on the court for his short temper and arguments with tennis umpires. Mother Tatum O'Neal was the youngest person to ever win an Academy Award for her role in Paper Moon at the age of 10.
