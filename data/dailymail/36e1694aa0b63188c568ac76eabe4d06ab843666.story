Police in one of the most affluent boroughs in London have been told to stop all prestige cars which are being driven after midnight after a spate of thefts using 'keyless' entry methods.

Officers in Kensington & Chelsea have been ordered to check the details of every driver of luxury cars such as Range Rovers and BMWs to ensure they are the rightful owner after Range Rover thefts soared from 23 in 2013, to 165 last year.

Last month alone saw a huge rise in thefts in the area with three Range Rovers and one other luxury car stolen from a Chelsea street within  weeks. Police warned as many as ten vehicles per night were being stolen with the method in some boroughs.

Almost half of vehicles stolen in London are taken through keyless theft, which includes towing and key cloning, according to recent crime figures from the Met. 

Using specialist equipment available online, organised criminals are able to make a key that can start the car without triggering the alarm in under a minute.  

CCTV captured one brazen thief who casually clicking open the lock systems of a Range Rover, worth £85,000, before driving away demonstrates the ease with which criminals are stealing the luxury vehicles.

In another case, property developer Laura van Bilderbeek, 38, had her BMW estate stolen from outside her home on Ormonde Gate in Chelsea last month. 

Scotland Yard says thefts of Range Rovers now make up 10 per cent of all 'keyless' thefts in the capital - while BMW makes up 15 per cent of the total.

Met chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said thieves were  buying devices for as little as £50 on the internet which allowed them replicate cars' electronic entry keys or using a device to insert into the ignition systems.

He said: 'Until we get that design problem sorted out we have a problem and my concern is that the number of cars being stolen will rise. This could very quickly become an issue.'

But car manufacturers have blamed EU regulations which mean the technology to programme the keys had to be available to organisations outside the dealer network- making it easier for gangs to get their hands on them.

 A spokesman for Jaguar Land Rover said: 'This is an industry-wide issue, as European legislation forces all car makers to make available information about their diagnostic systems, including any security updates.

Criminal gangs are using high-tech tactics to keep one step ahead of car manufacturers.

Using specialist equipment which is available online from as little as £50, they are able to break into some vehicles in under a minute.

Thieves use a hand-held device which they use as a 'key' to unlock the car without triggering the alarm. 

In some cases, this 'key' transmits the same frequency as a vehicle's entry fob and then hacks through thousands of code until it successfully finds the one that unlocks the car.

Criminals then dismantle them to remove the vehicles’ electronic tracking devices and the cars are often shipped to eastern Europe.

'Together with the SMMT, we are pressing for a change to the law, to prevent the abuse of that open access.' 

Around 24,000 cars were stolen in London last year - compared to 23,000 the previous year.

A spokesman for luxury car manufacturer BMW added: 'It's a technology race between ourselves and the criminal gangs.' 

'This is still a relatively rare type of theft.

'Because of EU regulations, (criminal gangs) are able to buy technology to help programme the keys which are used for the thefts. 

'EU regulations are there to allow organisations to provide servicing for cars outside the dealer network but it also means it's legal to buy this key programming equipment. It makes it very difficult for manufacturers to control.'

Assistant Commissioner Helen King, who is in charge of Territorial Policing, said owners of certain makes of car were urged to use steering or crook locks to  secure them with BMW, Range Rovers and Land Rovers, a particular target for thieves.

She told the Evening Standard: 'In Kensington and Chelsea with the density of Range Rovers being stolen there, they are literally instructing officers to stop that make of vehicle when they see it to check it is the legitimate owner who is driving it.

'We are encouraging owners to use that somewhat unsophisticated devices such as crook locks.' 

Police have launched an operation codenamed Endeavor to combat the thefts in the worst hit boroughs.

A Met spokesman said all boroughs were 'keenly aware of the threat of vehicle theft' and are using a range of tactics to tackle it.

In Kensington and Chelsea, this meant officers were currently stopping prestige vehicles seen being driven in the area after midnight, when many vehicle thefts take place.  

Figures from Thatcham Research, the motor insurers' research centre, show that between January and July 2014 almost 300 Range Rover Evoques and Range Rover Sports were stolen in London, along with 63 BMW X5s and Series 3 models.

A spokesman for Jaguar Land Rover admitted the thefts were 'an extremely serious issue for the automotive industry' and said the company had installed a number of updates to try and keep one step ahead of the criminal gangs.

'At Jaguar Land Rover, we have been working closely with the Metropolitan Police and other forces across the country and this has resulted in a number of prosecutions.

We have a dedicated engineering team continuously developing new technologies to try to stay one step ahead of criminal gangs. We are now introducing our fourth upgrade, which we are confident, will address the latest theft mechanisms being used.'
