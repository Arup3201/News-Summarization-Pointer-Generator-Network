Casey Anthony is pinning hopes on turning her journals into a money-spinning, tell-all book, despite the fact major publishers have balked at the idea of working with her, it was claimed today.

The 26-year-old has been keeping a diary ever since she was first put on trial last year for the murder of her daughter Caylee. She was acquitted in July of the two-year-old's murder but convicted of lesser charges including lying to police.

Anthony is currently on probation in Florida but the
court has ordered her exact location to be kept a secret because of death threats.

Dear diary: Casey Anthony at court during trial for the murder daughter Caylee of which she was acquitted. She is penning a memoir from her journals after becoming one of the most hated woman in America

She is said to spend her days inside, writing down her thoughts and editing past journals to find the best excerpts for her memoir. 

'Make no mistake, Casey will absolutely be releasing a book, it's just a matter of time. Casey feels this is the only way that she can get her story out and she feels that the public wants to hear from her,' a source told RadarOnline. 

However several big publishers have shied away from the idea of publishing Anthony's book for fear of a public backlash.

Her lawyer Cheney Mason told Piers Morgan on CNN last week that his client had no intention of writing a book.

Anthony broke her silence after a year to tell the presenter during a phone conversation: 'I'm not making gazillions dollars.

'I don't give [an expletive] about money... I may have in past... I was a stupid kid. I am 
26 now. I have gone through hell.'

Penning a memoir? Casey Anthony's last public appearance was in October when she posted a video of herself on YouTube

However, her attorney Mason did add: 'We are sitting back watching... When the time comes she will have her story to tell.'

It was initially speculated that Anthony
could command up to $750,000 for her first exclusive interview 
following her trial, but the big four national networks and cable news 
declined to pay that sum.

The
infamous Florida mother, had teamed up with Los Angeles-based TV 
producer Scott Sternberg to pitch an interview to all the networks.

According
to the Hollywood Reporter, the interview had a price tag of $500,000 to
$750,000, but CBS News, ABC News and NBC News all stated they would not
pay for an interview with Anthony.

Despite the denials from her lawyer, Anthony 
was said to be desperately in need of money as her reputation as 'America's most hated mother' has left her unable to go out in public.

She was also believed to want to change the public perception of herself. 

Anthony also told Morgan last week: 'I didn't kill my daughter...but I'm ashamed of the person that I was.'

Caylee's body was found in woods near Anthony's home in 2008.

After initially sticking by the claim that her daughter had been kidnapped, Anthony's lawyers then insisted at the start of the trial that Caylee had accidentally drowned in the family's swimming pool.

It is this primary inconsistency in 
her story that has sparked public outrage over the case and forced Anthony into hiding after her release.

It was revealed that she has spent the ten months since the trial at home, cooking, cleaning, exercising and watching television.

She has come to love old comedy shows
such as 'The Three Stooges' and 'I Love Lucy' and enjoys reading fiction, especially 'The Hunger Games' trilogy in 
which children fight to the death in televised contests.

Despite being vilified by the public, Anthony has not entirely shied away from publicity.

In October she appeared in a video diary which she posted on YouTube. In it she said she was 'making changes for herself', although failed to mention Caylee.

Her former lawyer Jose Baez is set to release a book in July called Presumed Guilty about defending his infamous client.  Baez reveals details about getting to know Anthony including her facial expressions and conversations. 

Anthony is not believed to be making any money from Baez's book.

The tell-all is being released by Ben Bella - the publishing house which is also behind John Edwards' mistress Rielle Hunter's book about their illicit affair.

What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me is due to be released on June 26. It contains lurid details about the disgraced senator's affair with Ms Hunter while his wife Elizabeth was dying of cancer.
