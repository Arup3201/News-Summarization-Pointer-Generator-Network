The suspected gunman has been named as Francis O'Donoghue, a 27-year-old who lives on the farm

Police are hunting a man who is believed to have shot two people on a farm.

The victims are being treated in hospital with serious injuries to their legs and chest but are in a stable condition.

Armed police remain at the scene in Navestock, Essex.

The suspected gunman has been named as Francis O’Donoghue, a 27-year-old who lives on the farm.

Superintendent Trevor Roe of Essex Police said: 'We are appealing for information from anyone who knows the circumstances behind this shooting, especially those people who know where Francis O’Donoghue is.

'Our initial enquiries suggest that the two victims and the gunman know each other but we don’t yet know the reason behind the attack.

'We are urging people who know Francis to avoid him purely because he is in possession of a firearm and those who come into contact with him should call us immediately.'

Supt Roe does not believe that members of the general public are at risk from O’Donoghue.

He added: 'There is nothing though to suggest that anyone else is at risk of being injured.'

Officers were called shortly after 3.30pm yesterday after the two men were shot on farmland off Goatswood Lane. 

Armed police will remain at the farm while the search for O’Donoghue continues.

The two victims are under armed guard in hospital.

Anyone with information in connection with this shooting is asked to contact Essex Police on 101.
