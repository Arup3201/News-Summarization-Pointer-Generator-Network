Builder's tea has long been Britain's favourite cuppa, but more of us are choosing herbal teas instead.

Sales of fruit and herbal tea have shot up 15 per cent in the past year. But at 6p a bag, compared to 2p for PG Tips, they're not cheap.

So, can you make your own herbal teas - and what do they taste like? Tessa Cunningham took the DIY brew challenge...

Home brew: Tessa Cunningham with her DIY herbal teas

Why drink it? Recommended as a cleansing tonic, nettle tea is supposed to be especially beneficial to the liver and kidneys. It can help soothe eczema and irritated or inflamed rashes and skin conditions.

Easy to source? I live in the countryside and can barely set foot outside without encountering nettles - but what mad fool would go anywhere near them? I don gardening gloves and set off brandishing a pair of shears.

Cost: Nil

How to make it: Back home - and still wearing gardening gloves to protect my hands - I pick off ten of the youngest leaves and dunk them in a colander, washing them under running water to get rid of any dust and dirt. I transfer the leaves to the teapot, add boiling water and steep for ten minutes.

Tea-licious? An unappetising green colour, the tea stinks of rotting vegetation. I have to hold my nose to take a sip, then throw the rest away. It tastes nothing like shop-bought nettle tea, which  is pleasantly earthy. To add insult to injury, I get stung by the nettles when cleaning the pot. So, nettle tea is good for the skin? Mine is covered in itchy stings.

Go forage: The ingredients can all be found outdoors - but some taste better than others when brewed

Why drink it? Mint is reputed to soothe stomach cramps, spasms and bloating, calm nausea and headaches.

Easy to source? The mint in my herb garden is well past its  best, so I buy a new pot plant from my local garden centre for £3. With a supermarket peppermint teabag costing around 8p, that's a big investment.

Cost: £3 for ten cups.

How to make it: Apparently, the leaves taste best if they're picked and dried for 24 hours beforehand, so I snip off two large handfuls, rip them to release the aroma and lay them on a tray in my kitchen. The smell is intense. When my leaves are dry and crunchy, I put them in my teapot, pour boiling water over and infuse for 20 minutes.

Tea-licious? It smells like cheap mouthwash, but tastes pleasantly refreshing. At this price, though, it's cheaper to buy my mint tea at the supermarket - a box of 20 bags cost 80p in Tesco.

Time for a cuppa: Tessa found the fennel tea the tastiest

Why drink it? Dandelion leaves and petals are supposed  to be good for treating fluid retention and urinary tract infections. Dandelion is rich in potassium - which is good for the heart, blood pressure and efficient energy conversion. It is also a liver tonic.

Easy to source? One look at my lawn and it's obvious I could provide an entire street party with dandelion tea. I pull up two armfuls in no time.

Cost? Nil.

How to make it: I select ten of the youngest and freshest leaves, wash them in running water, then dunk in my teapot of boiled water and leave for 15 minutes.

Tea-licious? Once I've got over the marshy smell, I'm impressed by the taste. It's slightly bitter, but refreshing.

Why drink it? An infusion of lavender flowers is good for a hangover, while soothing the digestive system and assisting the liver. The blackberry leaves add sweetness.

Easy to source? I have three lavender beds in my garden and snipping off the heads takes a matter of minutes. There are lots of blackberry leaves in nearby hedgerows, but removing them with my bare hands means my fingers look like a pin cushion. You can buy dried lavender and blackberry leaves online - but at £3.50 for 15g of dried lavender and £2.94 for 250g of blackberry leaves, these can be expensive.

Cost? Nil from my garden.

How to make it: I chop up 2tbsp of lavender florets and the beautiful smell fills the kitchen. I feel better already as I add a handful of the leaves, then steep in boiling water for ten minutes.

Tea-licious? My tea is a pretty pink and smells sensational. The lavender smell is so intense it's like holding my head over neat lavender oil. Sadly, that's exactly what it tastes like. It's so sticky I want to gag. The blackberry leaves are horribly bitter.

Sourced from nature: Save money on shop bought tea bags by picking your own nettles, mint and blackberries

Why drink it? Camomile is supposed to help hayfever and asthma sufferers. It is also useful for calming stomach spasms and easing indigestion, bloating and hiccups. A cup before bed is also said to help a good night's sleep.

Easy to source? You can buy dried camomile flowers online (£1.80 for 50g), but I am keen to forage for my own. Sadly, I wouldn't know it if I fell over it, so I contact the Botanical Society of the British Isles. Their local expert tells me I need to head to the New Forest, 20 miles from my Hampshire home, where it still grows wild in patches. They provide me with an Ordnance Survey reference and tells me camomile looks like a tiny daisy. Two hours later, I'm wading through cow pats, night is falling and I'm exhausted. Eventually I spot a few clumps of what I assume is camomile. It's supposed to have a sweet, apple-like aroma - mine stinks of manure.

Cost? Nil.

How to make it: As with most flower teas, the taste is more intense if you dry the flowers. You can then store it for up to six months in an airtight container. Instead, I wash the flowers to remove any dirt, then pop 2tbsp into my teapot with boiling water. It infuses for 15 minutes.

Tea-licious? This is so refreshing and pleasant that, as I take my first sip, I manage to banish all thought of the germs that might still be clinging to those dungy camomile flowers. I sleep like a baby - and I don't think that's just because of my march through the New Forest.

Why drink it? A spicy tea recommended for relieving windy digestive systems, it is also a folk remedy for relieving the aches and pains of flu.

Easy to source? I buy a jar of fennel seeds from my local supermarket for £1.

Cost? £1 for 13 cups of tea.

How to make it: I use a pestle and mortar to crush 1tsp seeds, then leave them to infuse in boiled water for ten minutes.

Tea-licious? The tea smells and tastes every bit as good as a shop-bought version. It's a nice, dark colour with a liquorice-like aroma. I'll need to grow my own fennel to make the home-brew version cost effective.
