Sentencing: Judge Stephen Holt

An illegal immigrant branded a ‘one man crime wave’ was jailed for two years today for a string of new offences - just a year after winning £17,360 compensation for being unlawfully detained while awaiting deportation.

Joseph Mjemer's list of 12 new crimes includes violence and handling stolen goods.

The 29-year-old from Yiewsley, West
 Drayton, arrived in the UK as a stowaway in 2003 and used at least five aliases and claimed to be from four 
different countries.

But last year a High Court Judge ruled he had been unlawfully held in prison while 
immigration officials tried to establish where he came from so they 
could deport him.

By that time he had already committed more than 
20 offences.

Sentencing him to jail today, Harrow Crown Court Judge Stephen Holt told bearded body-builder Mjemer: ‘You
 could be described as a one-man crime wave that continues committing 
very annoying offences, that frightens and distresses the public.

‘You have built up in the last few years numerous convictions, covering numerous offences.

‘I take into account your difficult 
childhood, but where that was, who knows? Even you do not seem to know 
and I take into account that you spent four-and-a-half years in Home 
Office custody and the High Court ordered your release.

‘You have been given numerous chances and have failed to comply. The time has come for nothing other than a custodial sentence.’

‘You
 have a complete disregard for court orders and you have used up most of
 your mitigation,’ Judge Holt told the defendant, adding: ‘You have been given 
opportunities and not taken advantage of them.’

Ruling: Joseph Mjemer was awarded £17,000 in a taxpayer funded compensation payout after Judge Stephen Stewart QC ruled he was falsely imprisoned

His latest appearance before a judge saw Mjemer convicted of assaulting two 17-year-olds on an Underground 
train, plus two counts of threatening behaviour towards a member of Tube
 staff and a schoolteacher with a group of children.

He was also convicted of unlawfully 
possessing anabolic steroids, driving a motorbike while disqualified and
 uninsured, handling a stolen iPhone and failing to attend court 
hearings on four different occasions.

These offences put him in breach of a 
12-month suspended sentence for handling a stolen car and this was 
activated.

Judge Stephen Stewart QC ruled that the last four months of Mr Mjemer's detention had been unlawful

He was also disqualified from driving for three years.

Mjemer’s lawyer Mr Scott Wainwright 
told the court: ‘He has difficulty with anger management. Keep in mind 
this young man’s difficult upbringing.

‘He
 was brought up in the western Sahara, in Algeria and this has had a 
detrimental effect on his mental health and contributes to the volatile 
way he seems to behave.’

The
 lawyer claimed anti-psychotic and anti-depressant drugs Mjemer received
 in Home Office detention affected his memory and ability to keep court 
and probation appointments.

Mjemer told the judge from the dock: ‘Probation have failed to help me, they have not referred me to the Hillingdon mental health unit. I have been kicked out of three surgeries because I cannot control myself. I can’t hear the word ‘no’.’

Last year Mjemer's lawyers argued at the 
hearing in London that he had been unlawfully held in prison while 
immigration officials probed his claim for asylum.

High Court Judge Stephen Stewart QC 
awarded him the compensation in November, last year for the period he 
had spent in ‘administrative custody’.
