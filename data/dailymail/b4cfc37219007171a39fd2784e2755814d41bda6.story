They are a stunning insight into how Apple's most iconic products came to be.

The amazing images show the unique transparent prototypes used by Apple's engineers as they worked out how to create the firm's best known machines - and some of its flops.

It comes as Apple's Macintosh celebrates its 30th birthday.

An incredibly rare Apple III machine. It was never made in this format, but this early unit was built especially for Steve Jobs in a transparent briefcase so he could take it to show customers.

Apple's first Macintosh was introduced by Steve Jobs on January 24, 1984, two days after the Ridley Scott-directed TV commercial introducing the idea of the Macintosh appeared during the Super Bowl between the Washington Redskins and the Los Angeles Raiders.

The first mass-market personal computer featuring a graphical user interface and mouse, the first version boasted 128k of memory and sold for $2,495.

The brand continues until this day, with Apple's iMac, MacBook and MacBook Pro on sale.

The amazing prototypes were tracked down by Software engineer Jonathan Zufi, who spent four years on the project, taking 150,000 photos in total, buying 500 products and persuading collectors to give him access to 50-60 prototypes.

'The project started in 2009, when I was reminiscing about an old game, Robot War,' he told MailOnline.

'I went onto eBay to buy it, and then looked for an Apple II to play it on - and thought it would be cool to see them all in the way Apple show them today in their promo photographs.'

The Apple IIc, the fourth model in the Apple II series of personal computers, was Apple Computer's first attempt at a portable computer. It went on sale in 1984 for $1295.

Zufi then worked with photographers to learn how to take photographs in an 'Apple' style, before beginning his quest to try and photograph every Apple machine.

He said collectors were keen to show off their devices.

'The underlying theme is that these collectors love their treasures and were more than happy to have them documented for the world to see.

'And of course, they contributed to my own personal quest to photograph every product that Apple has ever produced and brought my dream just that little closer to reality

'All the prototypes were really interesting, the whole transparent design was fascinating,' he said.

The products include everything from Apple's first Macintosh machines to the Newton' it's first attempt at a handheld tablet-like device.

The device was a failure, but laid the groundwork for Apple to pursue the area, eventually culminating in the iPhone and iPads we know today.

Zufi said the prototypes were needed because of the way Steve Jobs worked.

'Apple worked in a different way to most firms, Steve Jobs would say I want it to look like this, so they would built these transparent machines and shove the guts into the design - in most other firms it was the other way round.'

'A very large number of those machines used these prototypes, and they were so engineers could see where every component was.

The Macintosh portable, the first battery-powered Mac, was released on September 20, 1989 with a mono screen, and sold for $6,500

The finished version of the Macintosh Portable, which weighed 16 pounds (7.2 kilograms) and was 4 inches (10 centimetres) thick.

The ProFile was the first hard drive produced by Apple Computer in 1983, initially for use with the Apple III personal computer. The original model had a formatted capacity of 5 MB

'People took them home, many many years ago, and I managed to track them down. They do still leak out, but less and less.

This week sees the 30th anniversary of the Macintosh, Apple's most famous computer - and the name which is still in use today in the iMac and MacBook lines.

'The Mac was the machine that brought Apple to the fore, Mac was so compact, such a different experience,' said Zufi.

'The Mac brand has stayed all the way through, and it all stems from the Macintosh.'

The eMate 300 was a personal digital assistant designed for schools, and was introduced on March 7, 1997 for US$799.

'I received an email one day on my website from an ex Apple engineer telling me how much he loved the site.

'He included his phone number so I gave him a call and we got to chatting about his history.

'He started to tell me about a storage locker he has in Sunnyvale that he hadn't opened in 20 years and 'thought he might have some interesting stuff in there'.

'I hopped on a plane and flew out to meet him and it turned into a scene straight out of 'Storage Wars' - I was rummaging through this massively cluttered storage unit pulling out piece by piece and asking him if he understood how much these things were worth - he literally had no idea.

'Daniel Kottke, an early Apple engineer, also has a large prototype collection and he allowed me to visit him in Palo Alto, take all of his machines to my hotel room and photograph for a day, then bring them back.

'He also got hold of a very rare Twiggy Macintosh and allowed me to photograph that - as it turns out that Mac belongs to Gabreal Franklin who is running the 30th anniversary event this weekend (mac30th.com).

'There is another very prolific collector of prototypes over in Portland and this guy has a MASSIVE collection.

Each of the devices is a top secret internal prototype that staff were - supposedly - not allowed to take outside the office

'He recently quit the software business and decided to become a cop - I went to visit him and showed up in my rental car - we both packed all of his gear into my car and then I turned to him and said 'ok let's go' (I had rented a professional photo studio 10 miles from his office) and he said 'no that's ok - I have stuff to do today - I'll see you later'.

'I am certain that I would have had hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of rare Apple gear and he was happy for me to just drive off with it.

'Finally, there was one item that was being auctioned on eBay (the UniFile drive) and it sold for nearly $5000.

'I contacted the winner who was overseas in Europe and asked if there was anyway I could photograph it before it left the US - he agreed to have the seller ship me the drive, photograph it, then ship it across to the seller.

'It's quite amazing that he agreed to do that having never met me but he loved the website so much that he wanted to contribute.
