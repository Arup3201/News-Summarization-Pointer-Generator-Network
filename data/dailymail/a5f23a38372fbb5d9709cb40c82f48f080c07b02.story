Speaking out: Boris Johnson threw down the gauntlet to David Cameron last night by publicly challenging him to impose a new wave of union reforms to combat the threat of a General Strike

Boris Johnson threw down the gauntlet to David Cameron last night by publicly challenging him to impose a new wave of union reforms to combat the threat of a General Strike.

The London Mayor called on Cameron to pull Britain out of the slump by clamping down on strikes, saying it was time to stop the ‘endless buggeration’ that disrupts public services.

In his first major interview since this newspaper last week revealed his secret talks about making a quick Commons comeback, Johnson said reports that he was plotting Cameron’s downfall were ‘twaddle’.

But he refused to rule out a Commons return before the next Election, due in 2015.

Johnson says his anti-strike blueprint is designed to support  Cameron’s drive to boost the  economy, but it is bound to be seen as a riposte to critics who say he lacks the substance needed to be Conservative leader.

And it could lead to a new clash with the Prime Minister, who believes the proposals ‘go too far’ and could increase the likelihood of a General Strike.

The Mayor’s supporters say his proposals are the ‘21st Century equivalent’ of the union reforms  pioneered by Margaret Thatcher and Norman Tebbit in the Eighties.

The reforms would outlaw strikes unless a 50 per cent threshold of members take part in a vote; ban all-out strikes among key public-service workers such as paramedics, firefighters and transport staff; force key public services to maintain a basic service and stop pickets intimidating workers.

Johnson’s proposals come  after he was forced to pay huge bonuses to London bus drivers and Tube drivers to stop them going on strike during the Olympics.

He has clashed repeatedly with Bob Crow, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, one of the last old-style militant union barons.

Burly Crow is accused of staging strike ballots involving a tiny  fraction of his members and RMT officials have been accused of heavy-handed picketing.

Johnson praised London transport workers for their ‘brilliant’ performance during the Olympics, saying: ‘They served the city well and made everyone incredibly proud.’ But, frustrated by his inability to change the law, he wants Cameron to rein in Crow and Co.

Adopting a new statesmanlike  tone, Johnson condemned last week’s call by the Trades Union Congress for a General Strike over the Government’s public-sector pay freeze. He said: ‘We’re going through difficult economic times. People have got to be able to go about their business. It [a General Strike] would be damaging to the economy, it’s not in the interests of unions or their members and it is unlikely to carry much support.

‘What we don’t want to see as unions start to flex their muscles in the autumn is a return to the unfair and unnecessary strikes and ballots that put a terrific psychological  burden on people who don’t want to take strike action.

‘There are hard-working people on London’s transport system who are unnerved by what is going on. There are intimidating people who stop them getting to work, or a strike is called on the basis of a very small proportion of the relevant workforce. That is not fair on them or their families.’

It is time to adopt tough, US-style anti-strike laws, said Johnson, who was born in New York.

‘In New York, not just emergency workers but mass-transit workers [the New York underground] aren’t allowed to strike at all. In cities like Madrid, they have minimum service requirements that mean even if there is industrial action, a certain basic service has to be provided. All those ideas are worth looking at.’

Johnson said a total ban on public-sector strikes is ‘not realistic,’ adding: ‘People have a human right to withdraw their labour. But we have to think very carefully about how it is done and the effect on people who aren’t in the ballot and suddenly find they’re co-opted into a strike they don’t support.’

Johnson wants his anti-strike package included in the Government’s economic growth Bill, which is due to be introduced in Parliament in the next few weeks.

‘It’s got to be seen in the context of a general agenda for growth and jobs – that is what people want, a solid drive. The job of the State is to free the private sector from excessive taxation and regulation by providing the essential framework of safety and infrastructure to allow business to flourish.’

But this latest intervention could cause a new Boris-Dave rift. The Mail on Sunday understands the Prime Minister believes there is  no need for tough nationwide anti-strike laws because it is a ‘London problem’ caused mainly by Crow.

A No 10 insider said: ‘Most unions are a busted flush.

‘If we give Boris everything he wants, it could backfire.’

Cameron wants a ‘watered down’ version of the Mayor’s strike- vote threshold plan, although the Chancellor, George Osborne, is backing Johnson.

The Mayor is determined to win his latest tussle with Cameron. ‘It makes a big difference what you go for. We’re asking for a 50 per cent threshold.’

He denies declaring war on the unions. ‘I’m very keen not to seem adversarial towards the unions or to be doing this in an aggressive spirit.’

He defends his proposals: ‘What it does is take away unions’ power to cause endless grief and stress by threatening strikes and causing endless disruption and buggeration.’

It comes a week after this newspaper revealed how Johnson met Richmond MP Zac Goldsmith and discussed the Mayor taking over Goldsmith’s seat in a by-election on an anti-Heathrow third runway ticket.

This sparked frenzied speculation about a Johnson leadership challenge against Cameron. Johnson’s spokesman played down the report, saying it was ‘fanciful.’

In fact, according to a very reliable witness, the Mayor panicked when told that his talks with Goldsmith had been leaked. As he agonised over whether to confirm or deny the report, he exclaimed: ‘I can’t lie! I can’t lie!’

He was sacked by former Tory leader Michael Howard in 2004 for lying about his affair with writer Petronella Wyatt. It was a fib to this newspaper that sealed his fate. Wisely, this time, he did not lie, and told officials to confirm the Goldsmith talks, while doing his best to limit the embarrassment of being caught red-handed.

Asked point-blank if he is undermining Cameron, Johnson the statesman resorts to his usual self-parody and bluster to get off the hook. He finally replies with characteristically colourful – and disarming – hyperbole: ‘It is self-evident twaddle. As everybody remembers, I was one of the first in the tiny taxiful of supporters to back Cameron in 2005.

‘He’s a winner. He’ll win an Election outright in 2015. I remain a big backer of his and I’ve got four years of hard work here in London.’ Yet even when he is swearing allegiance to the PM, Boris makes it sound insincere by referring to Cameron’s ‘tiny taxiful of supporters’.

Put on the spot over whether he will rule out a Commons return before the next General Election, due in 2015 – crucially, before his term as Mayor ends in 2016 – Boris the clown throws up another cloud of chaff.  Will he or won’t he rule it out? A simple ‘No’ will do. He has done it in the past, but appears reluctant to do so now.

It’s back to Boris the bogus bumbler, ducking and diving with the mock flattery and self-deprecation that has allowed him to rewrite the rulebook of political and personal conduct.

‘Simon, I’m going to regretfully and respectfully, with deep respect and continued admiration for you and your style and interrogatory methods from which I’ve learned so much over the past 20 years, I’m going to respectfully, I’m going to see if I can meet Mr Wang, who’s pounding my door to come and invest in London. OK matey?’

And with that, he was off to meet Wang Hongzhang, chairman of the China Construction Bank, the world’s 13th largest company.
