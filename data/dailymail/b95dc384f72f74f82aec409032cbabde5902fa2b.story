To be accepted in one of Britain's top universities will have many students jumping for joy.

But research found that with the privilege of attending such an esteemed institution, students are often having to work twice as hard for a degree as their peers at other higher education establishments.

A detailed survey of students from Which? and the Higher Education Policy Institute analysed the amount of time students spent on their workload, researching 13 subjects at different British universities.

They discovered that undergraduates taking history and philosophy courses at Cambridge University can be expected to complete almost 45 hours a week of lectures, tutorials and private study.

This is almost double the workload compared with just 20 hours student at Essex University put in and 19 hours at Northumbria, the Daily Telegraph reported.

But disappointing figures reveal that despite all their hard work, a job isn't guaranteed for even the brightest graduate.

A fifth of graduates are unemployed or in unsalaried or low-paid posts six months after leaving university, official figures reveal.

One in ten are out of work and a similar proportion are on internships, doing voluntary work or travelling.

Those that have found employment are often stuck in menial jobs such as window cleaning, packing or bottling and stacking shelves.

The research by the Higher Education Statistics Agency paints a sobering picture for young university leavers who have spent at least three years studying and have built up large debts.

The news comes as a study found a 'squeezed middle' of graduates will end up paying far more for their student loans than highly paid peers or low earners, a study shows.

And women face the heaviest burden because they earn less than men on average and will take longer to pay off their debt, exposing them to more interest payments.

The 'inequitable' situation was discovered by an academic using the government repayment calculator.

Professor Ron Johnston, of the University of Bristol, found students who finish university owing £50,000 would repay £115,807 over 19 years, based on a starting salary of £35,000.

But a graduate who begins a job earning £25,000 would end up paying £159,899 over 30 years – with £26,664 waived as loans are written off after three decades.

Some students would never have to pay a penny back as repayments are not triggered unless annual earnings are more than £21,000.

Students from better-off families who fail to qualify for grants at university and then go on to work in modestly paid jobs would therefore be worst affected.

Professor Johnston warned women would face the highest repayments, as their salaries are usually lower than those of men with the same qualifications in the same jobs.
