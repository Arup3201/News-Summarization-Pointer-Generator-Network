Silvio Berlusconi yesterday said he believed the then 17-year-old dancer, Karima ‘Ruby the Heartstealer’ El Mahroug, was really 24 when he was alleged to have paid her for sex in 2010.

The 76-year-old former Italian leader and media mogul made his claims in a Milan trial in which he is fighting charges of paying for sex with someone under age and abuse of office.

Mr Berlusconi told the court that ‘nothing vulgar or scandalous’ had ever occurred during parties at his villa in Acore, and that the now notorious phrase ‘bunga bunga’ stemmed from a joke someone had made.

Mr Berlusconi, now 76, is accused of paying to have sex with Karima El-Mahroug in 2010 when she was 17

Accused: Berlusconi salutes as he arrives for a court hearing -now 76, he is accused of paying to have sex with Ms El-Mahroug 13 times in 2010 when she was 17

He said prosecution claims that the evenings were orgies in which he paid prostitutes dressed as nuns to perform strip shows had been made up to discredit him.

He also denied having had sex with Miss El Mahroug, who is Moroccan, or any of the guests at his parties, adding: ‘Everything happened in front of staff and, at times, my children came in to say “hello”.

But several guests have already testified how strippers performed and money was exchanged for sex. Mr Berlusconi also insisted he was innocent of abuse of office.

Prosecutors say he lied to the police in May 2010, telling them Miss El Mahroug was the granddaughter of the then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak in order to have her released after she was held for suspected theft.

Denials: Ms El-Mahroug who is widely known as Ruby Rubacuori ('heart-stealer') has always denied having sex with the prime minister when she was 17 - or being a prostitute

He said: ‘She told me she was a relative of Mubarak. I didn’t want to create a diplomatic incident.’

But last year magistrate Annamaria Fiorillo insisted that she had not given her permission for the release.

She said she had told police at the time: ‘If she’s the granddaughter of Mubarak then I’m Queen Nefertiti.’

Prosecutors claim he had sex with her 13 times.

Pressure: He has also been accused of using his power to pressurise Milan police to release the nightclub dancer when she was arrested for theft.

He insisted that the expression bunga-bunga to refer to alleged sex parties came from a joke he had  made, reported the BBC.

'I have never exercised pressure on officials of the Milan police,' he insisted.

'The girl said she was Egyptian, coming from an important family related to Mubarak,' he said.

He said that he believed her claim and telephoned police to stop  'a diplomatic incident. 

Correspondents have promised wire-tap evidence expected to reveal how women were procured for parties at the villa.

The list of witnesses named by Berlusconi are a roll call of the rich and famous and are said to have been guests at one of Mr Berlusconi's parties.

They include Real Madrid footballer Cristiano
Ronaldo, Hollywood star George Clooney and his girlfriend, and the 
Italian model and TV star Elisabetta Canalis.

Joke: He insisted that the expression bunga-bunga to refer to alleged sex parties at his villa in Sardinia, came from a joke

The former leader, who resigned over Italy's economic crisis last November, told the court earlier this week that he had hosted dinners where everybody ate together at his villa.

Berlusconi's declaration was spontaneous, as is allowed defendants in the Italian judicial system, and did not have the weight of sworn testimony.

His lawyers have indicated he will not testify.

Berlusconi has repeatedly denied the charges.

Mr Berlusconi faces up to 15 years in jail if found guilty.
