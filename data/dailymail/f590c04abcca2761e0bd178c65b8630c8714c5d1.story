Heavy metal rockers Iron Maiden say the Glastonbury Festival has become too ‘middle class’.

Bruce Dickinson, the band’s privately-educated lead singer who is also a qualified airline pilot, will not be joining fellow rockers Metallica at the 'bourgeois' event.

Instead Dickinson will top the bill at hard rock festival Sonisphere, at Knebworth Park - where Metallica will also appear - the week after Glastonbury.

No regrets: Bruce Dickinson said he was glad Iron Maiden was playing a hard rock festival instead of Glastonbury

Dickinson told the Telegraph: ‘In the days when Glasto was an alternative festival it was quite interesting.

‘Now it’s the most bourgeois thing on the planet. Anywhere Gwyneth Paltrow goes and you can live in an air-conditioned yurt is not for me.

Dickinson singled out Gwyneth Paltrow for particular criticism, saying anywhere she goes 'is not for me'

‘We’ll leave the middle classes to do Glastonbury and the rest of the great unwashed will decamp to Knebworth and drink lots of beer and have fun.’

When the festival first started in 1970 - the day after Jimi Hendrix died - it was called the Pilton Pop, Blues and Folk Festival, attracted just 1,500 people and charged £1 for a ticket.

The Kinks headlined the events, and attractions included free milk from Worthy Farm and an ox roast.

In 1971 
the event was free to enter, and prided itself on being less commercial 
than other events, taking up the medieval tradition of music, dance, 
poetry, theatre, lights and spontaneous entertainment.

Attendance
 that year shot up to 12,000, with acts included David Bowie playing. It
 was also the first year the iconic pyramid stage was built using 
scaffolding and tarpaulin.

Nowadays tickets cost £210 each, and all 120,000 of them sold out within just one hour and 27 minutes for this year's event.

The
 campsite, once little more than a muddy field, now boasts VIP areas 
with some companies offering luxury tents complete with duvets, pillows,
 lighting, toiletries.

So-called glampers will also have access to private facilities such as luxury showers, a make-up parlour, restaurant and bar.

Other companies offers tipis with Egyptian cotton sheets, rugs, double beds and bamboo towel rails.

Festival organisers have spent £600,000 on smell-free ‘super loos’ this year, instead of the much-feared portable toilets of old.

Tech-savvy campers will also be able to charge their phones at the event, taking place on Worthy Farm in Somerset next weekend, using charging stations, will have 4G provided by EE and be able to pay with credit cards at the food stalls.

The second year Glastonbury was held, in 1971, entrance was free and it prided itself on being unlike other more commercial events. Headliners that year included David Bowie

Nowadays campers can sleep in solar-powered pods, or in a luxury tipi complete with double bed, linen, duvets with access to beauty parlors, 'vanity vans', restaurants and bars
