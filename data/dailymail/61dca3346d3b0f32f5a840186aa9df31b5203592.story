The children of an Australian drug mule, jailed last week in Cambodia for trying to smuggle heroin out of the country, have written her heartwrenching letters, telling her how much they miss her. 

The touching notes, in the children's own handwriting, were delivered to Yoshe Ann Taylor in her cell at Phnom Penh’s Police Judiciary this week as she began her 23-year sentence. 

The emotive words express the children’s desperate wish to see their mother again, The Courier Mail reported.

'I miss you very much and hope to see you soon … Have you been OK? Happy birthday for before,' one of the letters said.

Serving 23 years in a Cambodian jail, Yoshe Ann Taylor received letters from her children this week which expressed their longing to see their mother 'soon'

She planned to be away for a week - but never came home.

'I miss you very much and hope to see you soon … have you been OK? Happy birthday for before'

From a letter sent to Taylor by one of her children

Taylor, 42, who had taught at schools in Esk and Fernvale, was arrested at Phnom Penh International Airport in September as she prepared to board a plane.

Officials found 2.2kg of heroin stitched into the spine of the woman’s backpack, which she claimed she did not know was there.

Taylor, who had been living in Esk, in south east Queensland, and homeschooling her children, told authorities she had travelled overseas to start an Australian arm of an art company based in Cambodia.

Taylor’s ex-partner said she had run up debts and had experimented with drugs in the past, but he believed she had been duped into being a drug mule.

'She is incredibly naive,' he said.

Taylor was arrested with a 19-year-old Frenchwoman, Charlene Savarino, after police also found heroin in her luggage.

The Phnom Penh Municipal Court sentenced Taylor to 23 years and Savarino to 25 years in prison on May 28, and ordered both to pay $US12,500 ($A13,500) in fines.

A Nigerian accomplice, 23-year-old Precious Chneme Nwoko, was subsequently arrested in Phnom Penh and sentenced to 27 years in jail.

Two other Nigerian men, who remain at large, were sentenced in their absence to 27 years in jail each for their involvement in the case.
