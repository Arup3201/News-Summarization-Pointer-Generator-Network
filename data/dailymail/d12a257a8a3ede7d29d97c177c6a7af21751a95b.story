The fight broke out after Albuquerque Isotopes infielder Erisbel Arruebarrena shoved at Aces pitcher Mike Bolsinger for throwing the ball at him.

The situation escalated quickly - both benches were cleared as Reno players chased Arruebarrena and eventually bundled him to the ground while his team mates tried to protect him.
