Everton coach and club legend Duncan Ferguson was involved in a motorway car crash, but true to his hard-man image he refused to go to hospital.

The 43-year-old was driving on the M57 near Liverpool when the car behind crashed into the back of the club's £18,000 BMW 1 Series he was driving. 

The crash took place early on Thursday morning and left the other motorist's car, an Audi A3 convertible, with considerable damage.

Neither driver is thought to have sustained serious injuries, and Ferguson refused to go to hospital for treatment.

Police arrived at the scene and attempted to restore order to the motorway but large traffic jams had already built up behind the crash

The former Rangers forward spent 10 years at Everton over two different spells, and built a reputation as a no-nonsense, competitive front man.

Ferguson, who has scored more Premier League goals than any other Scottish player, has been working as a coach at Everton and was even touted for the manager's job following David Moyes' departure in 2013.
