The celebrity hairstylist behind Karlie Kloss' trademark bob has found himself in the midst of a financial scandal after reports emerged that it was alleged tax delinquency which led to the closure of his high-end namesake salon at New York City's Sherry-Netherland hotel last January.

Garren, who goes by his first name only, has trimmed the tresses of hundreds of celebrity clients; earlier this year, he styled Karlie and Taylor Swift's hair for the March cover of Vogue, and worked backstage at New York Fashion Week working with the likes of Gigi Hadid and Anna Ewers.

However, despite achieving something of a celebrity status among his fans, the stylist is believed to $504,387.42 in back taxes, according to  Page Six, and is also thought to owe several of his former employees several months’ worth of wages.

Other former stylists who worked at his salon claim that they were never informed the business would be shutting down for good, and were left without any information after simply being told not to come into work.

One staffer told Page Six that Garren even claimed the salon was closed on New Year's Day because of 'electrical problems'.

Although many of his former employees are angry over the surprise closure, the legendary hairstylist remains popular with high-powered Manhattanites, who are now requesting him to make house calls.

'No matter what happens, no one is going to take away his one thousand Vogue covers,' a staffer told the publication.

The source continued: 'There are clients that said: "I would never see him again" [but] who now hire him to cut their hair in their kitchens. They are just so happy to have him [doing house calls].'

And even though the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance reports that Garren owes a half a million dollars as of February 18, 2015, his talent is still in high demand. 

Garren, who has yet to comment about the allegations, is reportedly going to be featured in upcoming W magazine’s May issue.

When the news of his salon's closure first broke last January, a spokesperson for his hair care product line told Page Six that he had closed the shop because he had plans to expand his product line and that he also had plans to open a salon in Miami in 2016.

And while the reason he closed the doors of his salon remain unknown, the demise of his business hasn’t prevented the stylist from working on the luscious locks of many A-list stars in the past few months.

In addition to Karlie and Taylor's Vogue cover, Garren has also done Madonna's hair for her Rebel Heart album cover, Kendall Jenner's spread in Vogue and Gigi Hadid's hair at the Anna Sui fall/winter 2015 show during New York Fashion Week.

Garren, who launched his career and in the 1970s, had a salon in Henri Bendel before he moved to his most recent Sherry-Netherland location.

He also co-founded the hair-care line R+Co with fellow hairstylists Thom Priano and Howard McLaren.
