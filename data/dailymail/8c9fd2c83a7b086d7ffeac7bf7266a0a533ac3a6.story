A 27-year-old woman whose decomposing body was found on a New Mexico mesa left behind a cell phone video explaining she was lost, authorities said.

'There is a video of herself ... talking to herself ... talking about how she has been lost over two days at that point,' Sandoval County Sheriff Doug Wood said.

Authorities suspect the remains are those of Brenda Lea Salas, a 27-year-old Bernalillo resident who disappeared in June 2012 following a fight with her boyfriend.

She was last seen at a Walmart in nearby Rio Rancho wearing a gray Winnie the Pooh sweatshirt, blue jeans and Sketcher shoes, KOAT reported. .

Two weeks after she vanished, her abandoned car was discovered stuck in the sand on a remote dirt road.

For nearly two years, her disappearance baffled investigators who had combed a wide stretch of desert but found few clues.

On Easter Sunday, Mike Zeyen, a mechanic from Rio Rancho, his wife, two daughters and the family dog - a German shepherd named Billy Jean - were out hunting for fossils on West Mesa, a desert area near Albuquerque, when they found human remains, the station KOB reported.

Close to the bones were clothes, keys and the cell phone with the video, which has not been publicly released.

said. Wood said investigators will show the woman's family the message 
after they're processed the video and other evidence.

According to deputies, Brenda Salas, a mother of two, was last seen alive June 14, 2013, when she took off in her Buick after an argument with her boyfriend, Tim Vialpando.

The next day, her family filed a missing persons report. Two weeks later, Salas' Buick turned up on a remote dirt road wet of Rio Rancho, but there was no sign of the woman.

For two years, sherif's deputies had no breaks in the case, until on April 20 Mike Zeyen and his family stumbled upon human bones and a shoe in the dirt. It was also Zeyen who spotted Salas' cell phone.

Salas' boyfriend has been serving time in the Valencia County Jail since last December on charges unrelated to her disappearance.Â
