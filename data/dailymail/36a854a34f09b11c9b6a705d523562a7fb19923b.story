A single tuna roams a once-flourishing tank at an aquarium in Japan after more than 150 of its fishy friends died unexpectedly.

Workers at Tokyo Sea Life Park are scratching their heads after the most recent death on Tuesday, leaving just one lonely tuna in the vast doughnut-shaped tank.

Researchers are trying to find out the cause of their deaths, and one option being explored is poisoning.

A spokesman for the tourist attraction said: 'We have had the tuna tank since the aquarium opened in 1989 but never experienced this kind of mass-dying.

'We are studying what caused the fish deaths, but we haven't figured it out yet. We suspect that it could be due to new factors that were not present before.' 

The tank's lighting and other factors that could have caused stress among the fish, or the presence of a poisonous substance in the water are being considered.

The 2,200-tonne tank once housed 69 bluefin tuna, 52 eastern little tuna and 38 oriental bonito.

In December, the tank's population suddenly started plunging with just 30 fish alive by mid-January.

'The second last one that just died apparently crashed into the acrylic wall twice,' the spokesman added. 

'It suffered a broken backbone, which was unfortunate but not very unusual for tuna kept in a tank.

'An earlier examination has found some sort of virus among some of the dead fish, but it wasn't the kind that is usually fatal in fish farms.'
