A man who has been blind from birth accepted a challenge to guess the colors of scented markers by relying on his sense of smell alone.

Tommy Edison hosts a YouTube channel where he answers questions people who have the gift of sight pose about the experiences of blind people.

For his latest video in the series The Tommy Edison Experience, the YouTube host was asked by one of his followers to guess the colors of Mr Sketch scented markers by giving them a whiff.

Sixth scent: Blind YouTube host Tommy Edison created a video in which he tried to guess the colors of scented markers by smelling them

Colorful challenge: Edison predicted that he would be able to correctly identify four of nine colors

Wrong answer: Edison got the experiment off the wrong foot by erroneously guessing that the lemon-scented (left) and orange (right) markers were red

For his experiment, Mr Edison selected nine markers: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink brown and black.

Before getting down to business, the jovial host predicted that he would correctly identify four of the hues - an impressive feat considering that Mr Edison has never experienced colors.

The guessing game begins with a yellow marker that is supposed to give off a lemony scent. 

Edison removes the cap and sniffs the marker, trying to form an association between the aroma and the hue it represents.

'It smells like a can of Hawaiian punch or something like that,' he muses before erroneously concluding that the marker is red.

The YouTube host repeats his mistake with the orange marker, which he again misidentifies as red.

'I'm going to guess that that smells like grape. Therefore, if I know my food and colors right, it would be purple?' he says in the clip while holding a red, cherry-scented marker to his nose.

'This game is not easy,’ he laments.

Edison’s luck finally turns when he correctly guesses that the mint-scented marker is green and the one that smells like liquorice is black.

'Look at me go, I'm on fire!' he exclaims with a grin.

But Edison's nose fails him yet again when he encounters a pink, watermelon scented Mr Sketch marker, which he guesses to be brown.

Edison also has no luck with a blueberry scent, which he mixes up with grape.

Mission accomplished: In the end, the jovial host was able to correctly identify four of the markers - an impressive outcome considering that Mr Edison has never experienced colors

'You might say I blew this one,' he quips.

Edison scores another victory by correctly identifying the color of the grape-scented marker as purple.

For the final test, Edison gives a cinnamon-scented marker a sniff, which he mistakes for chocolate, but correctly guesses that it’s brown. 

In some of his recent videos, Edison has tried to explain how blind people use paper money and a computer; what happens when a blind person gets drunk; how to make pizza when you're blind and what do blind people find attractive.

The affable middle-age man also takes on tasks such as cooking alone, using a DVD player and using an ATM to give his viewers an insight into how he is lives his life.

Mr Edison also reviews movies from the perspective of a blind person.
