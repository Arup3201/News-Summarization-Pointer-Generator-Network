A giant coffee shop billboard featuring a naked woman is brewing controversy in Washington, with locals demanding the racy sign be pulled down.

A picture of a blonde woman bearing her rear in a tiny g-string adorns the 10-foot-tall mobile billboard, parked on the side of various busy highways to promote two lingerie coffee bars.

While the unidentified business owner insists she has a right to advertise her coffee stands as she chooses, some locals are disgusted at the graphic nudity.

'It's completely unacceptable and I am offended,' mother-of-four Susan Evans told KXLY.com, noting she once ate with her family across the street from the sign. 'This must be taken down.'

Controversy brewing: Some locals are outraged at this billboard for 2nd Base Lingerie Espresso which features a nude woman with wings on a Washington state highway

It moves: The traveling billboard is shuttled between two Washington coffee stands - 2nd Base Lingerie Espresso in Spokane Valley and Big Shots Espresso in Spokane

The saucy sign is moved between 2nd Base Lingerie Espresso on East Sprague in Spokane Valley and Big Shots Espresso in Spokane city.

The owner of both outlets, who refused to be identified, told KHQ.com that she is not concerned with the community's frustration, and is focused on running her business.

The woman who appears on the billboard, identified by My Fox Orlando as Amanda Bennett, agrees.

Bennett, a mother who works as a bikini barista at Big Shots Espresso, told Fox the sign shows nothing more than you'd see at the beach.

'At least I have a job,' she said. 'I could be a mom out on the side of a road begging for money like all the people downtown or living in a homeless shelter, but this takes care of my family.'

However, many locals don't share the bikini babe's point of view.

'It's not something I'd want my daughter to see if I brought her with me,' Kandace Holquist, an employee of a nearby restaurant, told NWCN.com.

'I thought it was funny for a minute, but the second after that it was kind of like - kids [will be] driving by and looking at stuff,' Miguel Hernandez, also a restaurant employee in the area, said.

Resident Kevina Howe told Fox: 'I think women should have more self respect than that and they don’t and that just baffles me.'

Joey Johnston, who works at a nearby burger shop, said he can see why families are angry. 

'This is a family restaurant and this area, people drive by all the time,' Johnston told KXLY.com. 'Like I said, I don't have a problem with it, maybe if it was just a little less revealing.'

Fox reported that code enforcers said the sign was not allowed in the city of Spokane, but did not give a reason, while authorities for the Valley have not commented.
