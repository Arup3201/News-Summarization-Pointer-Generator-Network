Discount supermarket Aldi has banned sweets and chocolates from its checkout displays after complaints from parents about the 'pester power' of their children.

The UK's fastest growing supermarket said racks of sweets will be replaced with dried and fresh fruit, nuts and juices, following a trial of these healthier options at checkouts earlier this year.

From January 2015, all confectionery, chocolate and sweets will be removed from Aldi's checkouts and replaced with healthier options in a victory for health campaigners.

The decision follows a 16 week trial of healthier tills in a select number of Aldi stores from February to June.

Giles Hurley, Joint Managing Director of Corporate Buying at Aldi, said: 'The healthier tills trial enabled us to determine what our customers want at the checkout. 

'It quickly showed that healthier foods prove more popular with our shoppers than the traditional checkout offer of confectionery and sweets.

'Aldi takes a customer-focused approach, which involves helping our shoppers to lead healthier lifestyles. We are now pleased to be able to roll-out healthier tills as part of this.'

Kawther Hashem, Nutritionist for Action on Sugar, told MailOnline: 'We are glad to hear this announcement from Aldi, finally more and more retailers are ditching the horrifically unhealthy products from their checkouts, which only encourage "pester power" and makes the whole shopping experience more difficult for busy parents.

'As a nation we should be reducing unnecessary sugar and calories from our diet and one of the ways to help us do this is to stop impulse buys.

'An even better way is to make all the products healthier in the first place. We hope Aldi are looking at making all of their products better for everyone.'

The move by Aldi follows a recent study by the University of Sheffield which found nine in ten items at the checkouts of supermarket convenience stores would be considered ‘very unhealthy’, according to Food Standards Agency guidelines.

The vast majority of these were chocolate treats and stacked on shelves at one metre and below, which is directly in the eye-line of children aged three to five. 

The Prime Minister has previously lambasted stores for using this tactic, famously attacking WHSmith for putting boxes of chocolate oranges at checkouts.

As far back as 2006, the then Opposition complained in a speech about ‘irresponsible’ marketing techniques by shops. 

Marks and Spencer is one of the few remaining grocers still selling the snacks at checkouts

Similar moves were made by Tesco in May this year at all its Express and Metro stores after bosses found the most annoying part for parents was the 'pester' factor at the checkout when small children wanted sugary treats. 

Aldi's biggest rival Lidl has also banned sweets from the so-called 'guilt aisles' at at all 600 of its UK stores. 

Sainsbury's had scrapped sweets from its biggest store checkouts but has been criticised for continuing to sell confectionery at its convenience store checkouts, with a new shop opening almost every week. 

Marks and Spencer is one of the few remaining grocers still selling the snacks at checkouts - although campaigners are pushing the Government to pass a law making the practice illegal.
