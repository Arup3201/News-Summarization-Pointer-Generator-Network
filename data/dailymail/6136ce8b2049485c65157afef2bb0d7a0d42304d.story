She's been modelling since the 1980s and still looks better than women half her age.

At 49, Yasmin Le Bon, is as in demand as ever - and shows us just why in a new campaign for British label Winser London.

Clad in an array of fine oversized knitwear and sharp tailoring, the supermodel mother-of-three looks tanned and glowing.

The brand's founder Kim Winser has a background with Pringle and Aquascutum, and struck out on her own to produce high-quality knitwear and tailoring at a lower price point.

Fashionistas can snap up the ultimate cashmere sweater or supreme trench for prices that dip way below £200.

Burberry girl Emma Watson is such a big fan she even requested a shorter version of the trench to be made. Kim duly obliged and it's since been flying off the shelves as one of their bestsellers.

Other hero items include oversized, knitwear with signature 'W' weave or contrast fabric pockets.

The collection also features flattering 
desk-to-dinner dresses and relaxed separates.

The fabrics and yarns include superfine merino, 
hand-combed cashmere, super-soft natural viscose, cotton and silk, while the palette is primarily neutral with 
infusions of seasonal colours. Retail 
prices begin at £35.

'I am thrilled by the success of Winser London in our launch year,' says Kim Winser.

'It has been an absolute whirlwind with the brand taking off a lot more quickly than we had anticipated.

'For me the best moments have been receiving such positive feedback from so many customers - we are giving women real confidence in their dressing and that has been my driving desire.'
