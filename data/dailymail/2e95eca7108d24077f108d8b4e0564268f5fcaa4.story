Be your best you:  Louise Roe, pictured at a Golden Globes afterparty, says many of the women she made over on Style By Jury had lost confidence

I’ve always been fascinated by the power of a first impression. 

When you walk into an interview, a meeting, to a first date, or even just down the street – statistically you’re judged by others within eight seconds. Eight seconds. That’s fast, and brutal. 

It would be great if those around us didn’t make assumptions based on appearance, but the harsh reality is, almost everyone does.

So, it’s important to give yourself the best chance: to give your outfit some thought and make that first impression count. Clothes and make-up are certainly not as important as what’s on the inside, but I believe they should at least reflect a person’s best qualities. 

Many of the women I made over on Style By Jury were selling themselves short. They were funny, intelligent, kind and generous, but they had lost their way and their confidence, and it showed in the way they projected themselves – dressing like they’d given up and couldn’t care less. 

It’s not about spending a fortune on new clothes or having your hair blown out every day, but making small changes – figuring out the silhouette that flatters your figure best; wearing brighter color to express your personality; trying a little makeup to give your skin a glow; having fun with accessories. 

Preston [Konrad, Louise's co-host] and I are all about giving tips to help women watching the show find their very own style, to make the very best first impression possible. And we had fun doing it!

Take Sloane, for example, the lovely lady you see in this video clip. She's a dedicated mom, sparky, hilarious and full of life. The kind of woman that, after five minutes chatting with her, you want to open a bottle of wine with and laugh all night.

Her story is like so many other women: after years running around after her kids, with a full time job, she multi-tasks from dawn til dusk and puts herself at the end of a very long priority list. 

Sloane just didn't see herself as important enough to shine anymore, or to turn heads when she walked into a room. 

Emotional: Sloane sheds a tear when she hears what the jury has to say about her appearance

The comments our secret jury made about her when she first walked into the room, were honest and raw, and of course, upsetting. It was a horrible moment for Sloane to hear strangers' first impressions, but it was also a defining, pivotal moment that lead her to make a big change. 

Preston and I taught Sloane about body shape, how to wear print, how to wear comfy heels (yes I promise they exist!) and how to fix her hair so it didn't look like a messy mushroom (her words, not mine). 

Turning point: Louise says it was a horrible moment for Sloane to hear strangers' first impressions, but it was also a defining, pivotal moment that lead her to make a big change

When her daughter and best friend saw the final result, well I won't ruin the surprise, but let's just say there was a new person, inside and out, standing before them. 

Making a good first impression is a mindset just as much as an outfit. If you feel confident on the inside, it radiates on the outside. 

Top that off with a well-fitting, attention-grabbing look, and I'm not exaggerating when I say the world is your oyster.
