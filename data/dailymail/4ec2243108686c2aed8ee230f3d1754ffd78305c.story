A mom who was trapped in her car for 13 hours by enormous snowstorms that hit upstate New York and killed 13 people has told how her struggle to survive became so desperate she wrote goodbye letters to her daughters.

Karen Rossi, 47, was trapped under an enormous snowdrift while driving home from work at a hospital around storm-hit Buffalo last week, and feared for her life enough to pen the last messages to her family.

Her story comes as the rest of Buffalo and the surrounding areas are prepared for the next bout of challenging weather, as rising temperatures threaten to melt the snow, which fell seven feet deep in places, and trigger devastating floods.

Response: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, right with Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown, warned citizens to take precautions against the coming floods

Response: Military police and the National Guard were working to clean snow from roads and open sewers for water to drain into

Rossi's ordeal came in the early hours of Wednesday morning as she drove home from a double shift as a pharmacy technician in Mercy Hospital, South Buffalo.

On her journey around 3am from the hospital to her home in Lancaster she got stuck in a snowbank, and was trapped for good when a passing snowplow heaped up even more snow around her, so high she couldn't see out of the car.

The snow was packed so tightly that she couldn't open the car door, the Buffalo News reported. Instead, she wound down the window and used a sweatshirt to cover her hands as she dug round to the tailpipe so she could keep the engine running without poisoning herself.

She spent 13 hours - from 3am until 4pm - trapped with no way to see the outside. In her desperation she fished a scrap of paper out of her purse and wrote notes to both of her two daughters.

Ultimately she was able to summon help by pushing away enough snow to stick a red brush out of the snow and wave it for attention. After hours straining her arm with no idea whether anybody could see her, she was rescued by a passing monster truck driver, who shoveled her out.

Shoveling: Her story came as Buffalo resident are braced for severe flooding after the heaped-up snow melts in a coming band of warm weather

Reclaiming: Snow has stopped falling over Buffalo and surrounding counties, after the storm which claimed 13 lives

Rossi offered to show the letters to her daughters, but both have refused for the time being.

Thirteen people died in the snowstorms in Buffalo and the surrounding areas. At least one was found dead in their car in a fate similar to the one Rossie narrowly avoided.

Others died of exposure or from heart attacks caused while shoveling snow. Two elderly people died during an evacuation of their nursing home.

Although the snow is over, a band of warmer weather has stoked fears that the heaped-up snow could quickly melt, bringing devastating floods.

More than 650 members of the New York National Guard were in Erie county and Buffalo Sunday to help with snow removal and flood prevention, while hundreds of residents helped dig out houses still snowed in.

Rains fell around Buffalo today, soaking snow as temperatures hit 50 degrees. 

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo reiterated warnings at a news conference today, saying: 'Err on the side of caution. You prepare for the worst and hope for the best, and that's what we're doing.'

Danger: Falling rain could sink into snow on roofs around Buffalo, making it heavier and putting them under even more strain

Cuomo said evacuation plans and emergency shelters were being readied in case of flooding Sunday night and Monday. As a backup to Red Cross shelters, Cuomo said the state would have shelters at community colleges and state university campuses.  

Eric Burr, a New York military official, said: 'The focus right now is still snow removal. There's a lot of snow still on the ground and the key is to get rid of snow especially around drains so that water doesn't back up.'

Roofs collapsed and some people were stuck in their cars for more than 24 hours when the heaviest snow fall in memory hit areas of New York state along the Great Lakes.

On Sunday the National Weather Service posted a flood warning for the area south of Buffalo and Niagara Falls, saying higher temperatures - rising to 50 degrees Sunday and 60 on Monday - could rapidly release 6 inches of water.

The NWS said: 'Snowmelt is well underway and will continue through Monday. It is this snowmelt that will ultimately cause the flooding concerns, with the greatest amount of snowmelt occurring tonight and Monday'. the weather service said on its web site.

Since the storm blocked drains, roads may flood rapidly, and rivers and creeks could also flood over their banks, the weather service said.

Emergency workers had 180,000 sandbags at the ready for flood prevention.

'It is warming up already, it's in the 40s right now and based on the temps we've been dealing with, it's pretty balmy,' Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said Sunday morning.
