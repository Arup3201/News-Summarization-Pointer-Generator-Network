Arsene Wenger may have closed his transfer window early this winter, but the Arsenal boss can be safe in the knowledge that with Mathieu Debuchy sidelined whilst he recovers from a dislocated shoulder and Calum Chambers returning from illness, he has more than enough depth in the right-back position, according to Gary Neville.

After a relatively quiet January at the Emirates - with Wenger bringing in Villarreal defender Gabriel Paulista and 17-year-old midfielder Krystian Bielik - Neville was full of praise for 19-year-old defender Hector Bellerin, who he believes is going from strength to strength.

Speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football, the former Manchester United and England right-back admitted how impressed he was with the young defender's improvement this season since being thrust into the side against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League in September.

Bellerin impressed in The Gunners' convincing victory and scored a delightful placed effort from distance

Since being thrust into the limelight against Borussia Dortmund in September Bellerin has hugely improved

With Wenger short on options thanks to injuries to Debuchy, Chambers and Nacho Monreal, Bellerin - who made his Arsenal debut against West Brom in the 2013 League Cup before a short loan spell with Watford -  was thrown in at the deep end at the Westfalenstadion earlier this season when his side fell 2-0 to the Bundesliga strugglers.

Age: 19

Youth career

(2003-2011) - Barcelona

(2011-2013) - Arsenal

Senior career (league) 

(2013-2014) - Watford (loan) - 8 appearances

(2013-) - Arsenal - 7 appearances, 1 goal 

However, despite admitting he was not impressed with Bellerin's maiden Champions League performance in Germany, Neville thinks the Arsenal defender is finding his feet after solid performances against Manchester City and Aston VIlla.   

'The one that stood out most for me having watched him come back into the team against Manchester City and see him at close hand [against Villa] was Bellerin the full back,' Neville said.

'He was thrust into the team in September [at Borussia Dortmund] and he really struggled. He looked like it was too early for him.

The Spaniard's long-range strike against Aston Villa topped off a great afternoon for the Gunners 

'He got put back into another big game against Manchester City and he was massively impressive.

'The first thing is - has he got speed? I was told he beat not only Walcott's record but Henry's record for over 40 metres.

'He's lightning quick. That gives you a great chance as a full back.' 

The Gunners are in a great run of form, winning five games on the bounce after their 5-0 dismantling of Villa.

Pundit Gary Neville said that the 19-year-old is maturing into a fine full back since his Gunners introduction

Up next are local rivals Tottenham who, like Arsenal, are hoping to work their way into a Champions League spot with a win at White Hart Lane.

However, Neville expects Arsenal's short trip across north London to be a completely different kettle of fish for the youngster, with the likes of Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen in the form of their lives. 

'[Bellerin is] going to get tested by Christian Eriksen at the weekend, who's going to give him a different type of problem,' Neville added.

'But he's come into the team and its great for a young player to see them develop and mature.'
