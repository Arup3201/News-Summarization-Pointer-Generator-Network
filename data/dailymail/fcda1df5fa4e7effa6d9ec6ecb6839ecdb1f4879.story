The mother of a mentally ill 16-year-old girl who was held in a police cell for two days due to a lack of hospital beds claims she suffered heartbreaking failings in her care. 

The unnamed teenager was arrested in November at Torbay Hospital, in Devon, for an alleged breach of peace and later sectioned. But she spent two days in a cell at Torquay police station because no mental health beds were available.

Her case sparked an outcry and debates in Parliament, with the Home Secretary vowing to ban the practice.

NHS England has since apologised and described her care as 'unacceptable'.

The girl and her mother are not being named to protect the girl's privacy. 

Her mother told BBC Inside Out South West she was 'absolutely destroyed' to find her daughter sleeping in a cell.

'When I walked in and saw her lying there, on that floor... heartbreaking,' she said.

'She was on a blue thing on the floor - it's not even what you class as a police bed.

'She needed the right help.

'The police, I can't fault them, they did an amazing job looking after my child.'

More than 24 hours after the girl was put in the cell, Paul Netherton, Assistant Chief Constable at Devon and Cornwall Police, tweeted his frustration at the situation. 

He wrote: 'We have a 16yr old girl suffering from mental health issues held in police custody. There are no beds available in the uk! #unacceptable'

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was 'totally unacceptable for someone with severe mental health problems to be placed in a police cell'

His comments provoked a national debate and questions in Parliament.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was 'totally unacceptable for someone with severe mental health problems to be placed in a police cell'.

The girl was arrested at Torbay Hospital for an alleged breach of peace, and was then taken to Torquay police station where she was sectioned under the Mental Health Act the following morning.

She was never charged with any offence.

Once someone is sectioned under the act, it is the responsibility of the NHS to find a place in a specialist hospital where appropriate care can be provided.

As no bed was made available, the girl had to remain in a police cell until Saturday evening.

However, Exeter Labour MP Ben Bradshaw has claimed a bed was available, but the private provider declined the referral.

NHS England would not comment on the specific case, but said providers 'sometimes decline to accept referrals if they feel they cannot meet the individual's needs'.

The girl's mother praised the intervention of Mr Netherton and said that evening - two days after the teenager was first placed in the cell - a bed on an adult psychiatric ward was found.

'My daughter shouldn't have been held in a police cell for that long,' she added.

Following the case, the government announced the use of police cells as a 'place of safety' for teenagers experiencing mental health problems would be banned. Home Secretary Theresa May said: 'There is no place for this in our society'

In a joint statement, the South Devon and Torbay Clinical Commissioning Group, NHS England and Torbay and Southern Devon Health and Care NHS Trust, said the care was 'unacceptable and we apologise'.

'Following a review of this case, we have agreed a system to ensure that, in any case where a child cannot be found an appropriate placement rapidly, a clear escalation process will be followed,' the statement added.

However, the mother said she was yet to receive an apology from the NHS.

The girl has now been moved to a specialist hospital more than 200 miles (320km) from her family home.

'My daughter needs her family. We need her, she needs us. We are a close family and we don't cope without each other,' her mother added.

'The fact she's so far away from all of us hurts her even more.'

Following the case, the government announced the use of police cells as a 'place of safety' for teenagers experiencing mental health problems would be banned.

Home Secretary Theresa May said: 'There is no place for this in our society.'
