Marco Materazzi has insisted his former foe Zinedine Zidane doesn't require the relevant certificates needed to be a coach, due to his stature in the game.

The former midfield maestro, who currently coaches Real Madrid's reserve side, has been handed a three-month suspension for not having the necessary qualifications to coach in Spain.

The Spanish football federation also punished Zidane's colleague and reserve team coach Santiago Sanchez for not having the required qualifications.

Zinedine Zidane was and remains one of football's all-time greats after a prestigious playing career

But Materazzi, who was infamously headbutted by Zidane at the 2006 World Cup, says the 42-year-old's prestigious playing career means he should fast-track such procedures.

'When you're a champion like Zidane, Materazzi or a few others, you do not need coaching badges to coach,' the Italian told Canal Plus.

'If you have a 25-year career behind you, you should not need a certificate.'

Zidane has since launched an appeal against the ban and has been cleared to continue coaching until the issue is resolved.
