It has taken 70 years, but Natalya Pugachyova has finally found 
the grave of her soldier father after her performance
 in the Eurovision Song Contest

It has taken seven decades, but a Russian pensioner has finally found the grave of her soldier father - and it's all thanks to her performance in the Eurovision Song Contest.

Natalya Pugachyova, 76, became an overnight star earlier this year when she and five other pensioners from the remote village of Buranovo, in Russia's Udmurtia region, came second in the continent's famous singing competition.

The Buranovskiye Babushki group performed a catchy tune sung predominantly in the Udmurt 
language, a distant relative of Finnish, mixed in with a few lines of the chorus in English.

At a press conference Pugachyova revealed that her father, Yakov Begeshev, had disappeared in 1942 while fighting the Nazis on Russia's Eastern Front during the Second World War.

The last contact she had with him was in the form of a letter sent from a battle in the Voronezh region south of Moscow.

In it, Pugachyova, who was just six at the time, said her father described the fighting as so fierce he was unlikely to survive.

Her story was heard by Nina Geryusheva of the Bailiffs 
Service and a group of volunteers set out to find the site where Mr Pugachyova's had been buried.

After numerous phone calls and official requests, they were able to identify the 
mass grave in which he had been laid to rest.

This weekend Russian
 state television showed Pugachyova's visit to the 
village of Malaya Vereika in the Voronezh region, where she saw her 
father's name among those engraved on memorial walls at a mass grave.

'Even I sobbed,' Pugachyova said. 'So many years, so many winters, I didn't know.'

Nearly 27 million Soviet soldiers and civilians died in the Second World War, and tens of thousands are still listed as missing

 brought a handful of soil from her mother's grave to mix with that of 
her father's, and took a handful back to do the same at her mother's 
grave because she said she wanted her parents to be together.

As the oldest and smallest member of the Buranovskiye Babushki, Pugachyova struck a chord with millions of devoted Eurovision fans who adored the group's kitschy fun.

Nearly 27 million Soviet soldiers and civilians died in the Second World War, and tens of thousands are still listed as missing.

War enthusiasts roam the forests and swamps of western Russia in search of the remains of soldiers and their aluminum dog tags that identify them.
