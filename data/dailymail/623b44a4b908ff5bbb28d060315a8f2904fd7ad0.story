The world's population will soar by four billion to reach 11 billion by 2100, suggests a new study.

Using the latest statistical tools, researchers found that the number of humans on Earth is likely to reach 11 billion by the end of the century - around two billion higher than some previous estimates.

The findings includes the most up-to-date estimates for future world population, as well as a new method for creating such estimates.

Research carried out by Dr Rafferty from Washington University says the world's population will increase more than thought (stock image shown). This latest number is around two billion higher than previous estimates. The findings were published online by the journal Science

The study's corresponding author Dr Adrian Raftery, a professor of statistics and of sociology at the University of Washington, said: 'The consensus over the past 20 years or so was that world population, which is currently around seven billion, would go up to nine billion and level off or probably decline.

'We found there's a 70 per cent probability the world population will not stabilise this century. Population, which had sort of fallen off the world's agenda, remains a very important issue.'

The paper explains the most recent United Nations (UN) population data released in July. 

It is the first UN population report to use modern statistics, known as Bayesian statistics, that combines all available information to generate better predictions.

Most of the anticipated growth is in Africa where population is projected to quadruple from around one billion today to four billion by the end of the century. 

There are about seven billion people living on our planet and this number is set to reach almost 10 billion by 2050, according to UN figures.

This population explosion is largely attributed to better healthcare and farming practices, with some experts arguing that industrialisation in the 18th and 19th centuries was the tipping point that allowed more humans to thrive.

However, one social scientist claims the human population explosion has its roots as far back as 2,000 years ago.

Aaron Stutz, an associate professor of anthropology at Emory’s Oxford College in Georgia created a new model of demographic and archaeological data to show when humans thrived.

In a paper published in the journal PLOS ONE, he claims that political and economic reforms helped to create more stable families, and therefore enabled more people to thrive. 

The main reason is that birth rates in sub-Saharan Africa have not dropped as fast as had been previously expected.

There is an 80 per cent chance that the population in Africa at the end of the century will be between 3.5 and 5.1 billion people, according to the study.

However, other regions of the world are projected to see less change.

Asia, now 4.4 billion, is projected to peak at around five billion people in 2050 and then begin to decline. Populations in North America, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean are projected to each stay below one billion.

The study's first author Patrick Gerland, a demographer at the UN, said the figures largely support the 2013 UN projections, but add a new dimension.

He said: 'Earlier projections were strictly based on scenarios, so there was no uncertainty.

'This work provides a more statistically driven assessment that allows us to quantify the predictions, and offer a confidence interval that could be useful in planning.'

Most of the anticipated growth is in Africa (shown) where population is projected to quadruple from around one billion today to four billion 2100. However Asia, now 4.4 billion, is projected to peak at around five billion people in 2050 while North America, Europe and Latin America  are projected to each stay below one billion

World population projections are based mostly on two things: future life expectancy and fertility rates. Earlier techniques relied largely on expert opinion for how those trends were expected to change.

The newer forecast instead uses statistical methods to combine government data and expert forecasts for such things as mortality rates, fertility rates and international migration.

Earlier reports also represented uncertainty by using scenarios in which women would have 0.5 children more or less than the experts' forecast.

However, Dr Raftery said that method generates too big a range.

He said: 'In a given year and country the fertility rate might be half a child higher, but the probability that it would be half a child higher in all countries in all years in the future is very low.'

The new method uses statistical models to narrow the range, finding an 80 per cent probability that the population in 2100 will be between 9.6 billion and 12.3 billion.

Dr Raftery added: 'This paper brings together the research from the past seven years, and also brings in recent data.

'We can answer questions about future population growth using standard principles of statistical inference, which has never really been done before.'

He said rising population could act to exacerbate other world problems - such as climate change, infectious disease and poverty - while the two things that decrease fertility rates are more access to contraceptives and education of girls and women.

The findings were published online by the journal Science.
