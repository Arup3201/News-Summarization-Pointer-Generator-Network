Booted out: Slater, a bar promotion worker, was part of girl band Quantro but the group was thrown off the ITV talent show when the attack came to light

An X Factor hopeful who was thrown off the talent show after glassing her boyfriend in the face has avoided jail.

Lucie Slater, from Ryton, Gateshead, was drinking wine at the home of her DJ boyfriend William Aitken when she came across a message on Facebook which upset her.

The 21-year-old almost instantaneously hit her boyfriend 
with a glass in the face and threw the laptop across the room. Mr Aitken had to rush to the 
shower to try and wash the blood off.

Slater's escape from jail comes the 
day after a thug who launched a violent assault on a headmistress when 
she told off his son for racial abuse also walked free from court.

Paul
Stratford punched and swore at Zita McCormick after she told him his 
eight-year-old son Brendan would be excluded for a day.

Stratford
was ordered to pay his victim £100. And in another astonishing case 
yesterday, a Romanian thief who ran a £3million cashpoint scam with 
9,000 victims also escaped jail.

Leonid Rotaru was given an 18-month suspended jail sentence.

The
court heard that after glassing her boyfriend, Slater drove him to 
hospital, where she first claimed that Mr Aitken, 26, fell down the stairs. 
However, she later admitted what happened, the court was told.

Slater, a bar promotion worker, was part
of girl band Quantro but the group was thrown off the ITV talent show when 
the attack came to light.

After previously pleading guilty to unlawfully wounding her boyfriend in June, Slater was sentenced at Newcastle Crown Court to 51 weeks in prison suspended for two years.

She was also given a two-year supervision order and 120 hours of community service.

Due to the time he spent in hospital, Mr Aitken lost his business and modelling career because of his injuries, the court heard.

Mr
Aitken said: 'It has been life changing, my whole life changed from 
that moment.

'She wanted to come back to my house, so we did and we were 
cuddling but she saw a Facebook message and found something she did not 
like.

Anger: The attack took place after Slater came across a message on Facebook that she did not like. The couple are pictured during happier times

Argument: Lucie Slater, right, was drinking wine at the home of her DJ boyfriend William Aitken, left, when she  glassed him in the face

'Next thing I knew she swung round and hit me with a glass and my face began to pour with blood.

'I
really did not think she was capable of something like that.

'We are not
speaking to each other now but there’s so much to say.

'I
still love her and I want to know why she did it. It’s a really sad 
love story.

'We did not plan our future like this. Instead of us breaking
up, we have been ripped apart.

'It was an act of stupidness from her and she has caused a lot of damage.'

Judge Toby Hedworth said: 'I have 
listened carefully to the account and I have to say that drink played a 
greater role than is now suggested.

'I
also take into account the effect of your actions on Mr Aitken. All 
that he has ever sought in these proceedings was an acknowledgement of 
what happened.'

She
was initially charged with the more serious offence of wounding with 
intent but her plea to the lesser charge of unlawful wounding was accepted by the 
prosecution.
