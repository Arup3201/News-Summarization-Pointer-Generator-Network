The White House officially said Thursday what Twitter and MailOnline knew days beforehand: that President Barack Obama would travel to Colorado and Texas this week for a series of fundraisers. 

The events weren't part of the president's public schedule, but they became common knowledge after enterprising reporters obtained copies of exclusive invites for events with the president and shared them online.

The omission from Obama’s public schedule wasn’t an anomaly. The president and his administration have made a habit out of telling reporters at the last minute about previously scheduled out-of-town trips, fundraisers and speaking engagements.

Today President Barack Obama had lunch at the White House with a group of teachers. The luncheon was one of the few events included on the president's public schedule today

Every president has a private daily 
schedule that a limited number of his staff are privy to,
 containing details of all the president's activities throughout the day, including even his designated workout schedule and golf tee times.

Reporters usually don't find out about those outings until they are happening, and the public is only informed that the president has left the White House if someone from the White House press corps writes about it or a bystander posts photos online.

As Yahoo News pointed out today, Items like the president's
 recent lunch with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are often 
included on the secret, detailed copy of the president's schedule but 
are left off his public itinerary if they're considered part of his 
private life.

Neither the 
public nor the press would have ever known about that meeting if Clinton
 hadn't told a reporter from People magazine, who in turn tweeted – and deleted – a note and a picture related to the 
secret encounter.

The White House is not required to tell the public about the president's whereabouts but it sometimes opts to announce events the president holds at the White House as part of his presidential duties

The purpose of the president's secret schedule is to give him a modicum of privacy. But the current administration regularly keeps events Obama attends or holds in his 
capacity as President of the United States off the schedule it makes 
available on the White House website.

The move is meant to stop members of Obama's cabinet, Congress, representatives from allied groups, and 
even the public from crashing events to which they weren't invited.

It's especially meant to keep aggressive reporters from asking questions
 about meetings or events the White House wants to keep secret.

Which presidential activities are made available to the press is completely up to his handlers. No law requires the executive branch to release any details at all about the president's whereabouts. And his schedule isn't subject to Freedom of Information Act requests.

A 
comprehensive analysis of the president's public schedule versus events 
Obama was photographed at in 2009 completed by Politico just before the 
2012 election found that the White House kept secret at least one-third of
 the events the president held or attended until after they had 
happened.

'I would say the daily schedule they hand out is on the shallow side 
compared to presidents past,' longtime White House reporter Ann 
Compton of ABC News told Politico at the time.anniversary

The White House listed this May 7, 2014, Shoah Foundation event in Los Angeles, California, on the president's public schedule, but it did not mention that Obama would be rubbing elbows with director Steven Spielberg, second from left, and Bruce Springsteen, right, at the dinner

Little has changed in the time since Politico published its report. If anything, the president has went off-map more often.

Last week press found out the president would be giving remarks on the economy at a tech startup in downtown Washington, D.C. after the president had already left the White House.

On another recent occasion the president snuck off with Vice President Joe Biden to have lunch with construction workers at a downtown D.C. Shake Shack.

The White House still hasn't published details on the president's travel to Los Angeles, California, later this month, even though The Hollywood Reporter revealed in June that Obama would appear at fundraisers there on July 23 and 24 on behalf of the Democratic National Committee.

THR is also responsible for making public the president's fundraisers in Texas.

It wasn't until a reporter asked White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest last Monday about the alleged trip to the Lone Star State that the White House confirmed the president's plans.

The White House didn't send out details about Obama's travel to Denver, Colorado, tomorrow night until this morning – three and a half weeks after The Denver Post reported it.

As the midterm elections draw nearer, the president is expected to attend a long series of events benefiting his political party but the public is most likely to find out about those events, too, as they occur – or by happenstance.

This administration regularly fails to inform the press or the public about many of Obama's activities, however
