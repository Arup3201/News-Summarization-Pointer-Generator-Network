Authorities say a white woman shot in the back of head with a pellet gun while walking through Central Park Saturday was the victim of a hate crime.

The 36-year-old woman, who asked reporters to only call her 'Hannah,' said she was on her way out of the park at W. 60th St. and West Drive at about 12:05 a.m. when she encountered a group of young black people.

She said she did not speak to the group - two men and three women in their late teens and early 20s - but after passing them felt a 'horrible pain' in the back of her head.

Police have release surveillance footage of three young people believed to be involved in a hate crime assault on a white woman leaving Central Park

Police have also released a sketch of one member of the group that allegedly hurled a rock at the woman's head and yelled racial insults at her

'My hand went up to my head, and there was blood gushing everywhere,' Hannah told the The Daily News. 'I turned around, and I said, ‘What are you doing? Why are you doing this to me? What's wrong with you people?’'

She says they answered with racial epithets.

'F---- you, you f------ white b----,' she says one woman yelled at her.

She claims that another man appeared from behind a tree to join the group.

According to Hannah he screamed: 'All white people suck. F--- white people.'

She said the youths left and she began to cry.

'I was starting to go into shock,” Hannah told  The Daily News. 'There was a lot of blood.'

She was taken to Roosevelt Hospital after police and paramedics responded to the scene.

The unidentified woman says she was walking out of Central Park and had not spoken to anyone when one of the young black people she passed assaulted her

The NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force is investigating the incident and has released surveillance footage of three suspects as well as a sketch of one woman. 

'It's a hate crime — for no reason at all,' she said. 'I was
 just walking by. There was no sort of eye movement. There was no 
altercation, confrontation, anything like that.'

She calls herself a 'typical New Yorker' but she has not experienced racial insults while living in Manhattan with her husband. 

'I have friends and family of all backgrounds. That’s what I find
 so amazing, that people are that hateful,' she said. 'We all bleed red blood. There's no room for hatred. Not in New York. Not anywhere.'
