Love it or hate it, Vegemite is the iconic spread that has been an essential part of Australia's heritage dating back to the 1920s.

But 10 American kids were not too fond of the dark brown food paste made from yeast extract and vegetables.

And looks can be deceiving, as some initially reacted with excitement as they thought the bowl of Vegemite was chocolate pudding and questioned whether this was Australia's version of Nutella, a sweet Italian hazelnut spread.

Others were more sceptical, describing it as 'poop'.

The much-loved iconic Australian spread has been around since the 1920s

The children appeared in a YouTube video done by the REACT channel

Krischelle, one of the kids filmed for the REACT Channel YouTube video entitled 'Kids Vs. Food', held her nose and gasped in horror as a scoop of the paste was presented on a silver platter.

She was convinced the dark consistency of Vegemite was akin to 'poop' while most were hopeful and thought it was some sort of chocolate pudding - albeit clearly confused by its appearance.

'I've had chocolate but not this gross icky stuff,' Maxim said.

Olivia described the bowl of Vegemite as 'Nutella that's weird'.

Upon smelling it, she wasn't too convinced.

'It doesn't smell like Nutella, it smells like fish,' she said.

Others had a more interesting perception of the spread as they thought it was seaweed, soy sauce, teriyaki sauce or bread.

The dish of the day was Vegemite on crackers as all 10 kids squirmed as they took their first bite.

'That has a bad after-taste,' Jayka said.

While Lucas was a little off his mark when the mystery meal was plated up.

'Cookies!' he exclaimed.

None of the kids who tried the spread made from yeast extract would recommend eating it

So far, it has attracted more than 600,000 views on YouTube

But the salty and bitter taste did not impress any of the children,

'It's weird, acidy and makes you want to barf,' Lyndon said.

Olivia gave her critical review on the paste.

'It tastes like someone tried to make food and failed horribly,' she said.

When the name of the spread was revealed, most had never heard of Vegemite.

One thought it was 'like vegetables that tastes like termites'.

All 10 kids didn't recommend that others try Vegemite, agreeing that 'you're going to throw up if you eat it'.
