The hip hop group that was performing on stage when a man ejaculated onto a woman's back in the middle of the mosh pit has slammed the 'disgusting' act.

The 20-year-old woman, known only as Emma, was left traumatised after being assaulted while listening to the Thundamentals at the St Kilda Festival in Melbourne on Sunday February 8.

In a post on their Facebook page, the group urged anyone with information about the matter to contact police.

'We are both shocked and disgusted to learn about what happened at St Kilda Festival last week while we were performing,' the post read.

The Thundamentals, who were performing on stage when a man ejaculated onto a woman's back in the middle of the mosh pit, have slammed the 'disgusting' act

'In light of those events we would like to think that any true fan of Thundamentals that has understood the message in our music and followed our journey as a band would never commit such a disgusting and predatory act against another human being. 

'Furthermore, if any of our fans were to witness something like this happening that they would at least notify someone who could help assist the victim.'

The group went on to extend '100%' of their support the young lady who suffered, adding they 'hope that she is ok.'

At about 8.20pm, a man standing behind the woman performed the lewd act and then 'calmly' disappeared into the crowd.

The disgusted woman immediately took her top off, which is being forensically analysed by police, and asked a stranger to hold her wallet and phone while she went off to change her clothes.

'Everyone was jumping up and down on the ground along with the music so it was hard to tell if he was sort of going along with it or sort of doing something else,' she told The Age.

'I just felt something on me and turned around and saw him doing up his fly.'

Detective Senior Constable Carin Wood said it was disturbing that someone would have the courage and desire to do such an inappropriate act in public.

Emma admitted to being really appalled by the bizarre incident.

'It's really gross, pretty disgusting, he must be sick in the head to do something like that,' she said.
