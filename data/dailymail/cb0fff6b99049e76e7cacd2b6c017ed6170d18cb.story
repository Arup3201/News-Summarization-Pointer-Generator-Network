Michael Moore claims that he came to the rescue of a Palestinian director who was being threatened with deportation as he entered the U.S. on Tuesday for the Oscars ceremony.

Oscar-nominated Emad Burnat said that when he arrived at
Los Angeles International Airport with his wife and 
eight-year-old son, customs agents told them that his family would be sent back if they could not verify 
that he was invited to the Oscars.

However, a source at the airport told 
Buzzfeed that the director was not detained at all and that Michael 
Moore, the Palestinian director and his Israeli co-director are all talking
'baloney'.

The source added that they thought it was 'a publicity stunt for the movie'.

Outrage: Director Michael Moore, a supporter of Mr Burnat, expressed his disgust on Twitter at his friend's treatment on entering the U.S.

The director had brought his family to 
Los Angeles for Sunday's Oscars but said he was questioned for an over an hour.

Documentary maker Michael 
Moore said that he helped clear up the matter by calling Oscars' officials on Burnat's behalf.

Burnat had been in the United States two weeks earlier doing interviews about the film alongside his co-director, Israeli activist Guy Davidi.

Mr Davidi said he believed Mr Burnat's family had been detained because Mrs Burnat was wearing a hijab.

However, the airport source said that Mr Burnat was simply unable to produce his Oscars ticket straightaway so he was only taken to an inspection area while he located it.

The source said the whole incident only took 25 minutes and that Mr Burnat was not racially profiled.

Moore insists that Buzzfeed 'have been played' by their source because tickets for the Oscars were not released until Thursday, so he could not have produced it on Tuesday to convince officials to let him through.

The Academy did not respond to a request for comment on Burnat's detainment.

World-class talent: A still from Emad Burnat's Oscar-nominated 5 Broken Cameras which has already won at Sundance

Upsetting: Mr Burnat's son Gibreel, aged eight, who inspired his father's Oscar-nominated film, was also held by immigration

5 Broken Cameras, the first Palestinian documentary ever nominated for an Oscar, already has won awards at the Sundance Film Festival and the Cinema Eye Honors.

It features footage that the olive farmer-turned-filmmaker shot using five cameras in his occupied West Bank village of Bil'in, from everyday activities with his family to protests and shootings.

The son with whom he is traveling, Gibreel, was the inspiration for buying the first of these cameras in 2005; like so many parents, Burnat wanted to document the boy's first steps and smiles.

However he also found himself wanting to capture the tension and fighting that are daily occurrences in the struggle for territory. In the film, his cameras keep getting destroyed in the violence.

Burnat said in a statement on Wednesday that he is used to the kind of questioning he and his family underwent.

Mr Burnat said: 'There are more than 500 Israeli checkpoints, roadblocks, and other barriers to movement across our land, and not a single one of us has been spared the experience that my family and I experienced yesterday.

'Ours was a very minor example of what my people face every day.'
