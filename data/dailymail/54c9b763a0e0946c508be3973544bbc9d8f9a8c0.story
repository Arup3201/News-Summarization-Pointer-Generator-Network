This never-before-seen view of the moon orbiting the Earth is exactly how alien visitors would see our planet for the first time from their starship windows.

The images were taken 600,000 miles away by the Juno satellite as it passed Earth in October, on its way towards Jupiter. The smaller grey moon is shown passing behind the larger white dot of our planet, to the right.

When the Nasa probe flew past 
Earth after performing a series of deep space manoeuvres it  received a boost in speed of more than 8,800 mph setting it on course to reach Jupiter by 4 July, 2016.

A new video that shows Earth and the moon travelling through space together for the first time has been released by Nasa. The larger white dot pictured here is Earth, while the faint grey dot is the moon

The Juno spacecraft was launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on 5 August, 2011.

It first performed a series of deep space manoeuvres before returning to Earth for a flyby.

When the spacecraft flew past Earth on 9 October this year it received a boost in speed of more than 8,800 mph.

This set it on course to reach Jupiter by 4 July, 2016.

After
 Juno arrives and enters into orbit around Jupiter, the 
spacecraft will circle the planet 33 times, from pole to pole and use 
its collection of science instruments to probe beneath the gas giant's 
obscuring cloud cover.

Scientists will learn about Jupiter's origins, internal structure, atmosphere and magnetosphere.

Professor John Jorgensen, who was involved in the project, told MailOnline the footage was taken over a four-day period.

He added the camera was programmed to take an image every 2.5 minutes during every 5 rotations of the spacecraft.

One of Juno's sensors, a special kind of camera designed to track faint stars, was able to give a unique view of the Earth-moon system.

The result was low-resolution glimpse of what Earth would look like to a visitor from afar.

‘If Captain Kirk of the USS Enterprise said, "Take us home, Scotty," this is what the crew would see,’ said Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator at the Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio.

‘In the movie, you ride aboard Juno as it approaches Earth and then soars off into the blackness of space.

‘No previous view of our world has ever captured the heavenly waltz of Earth and moon,’ he added.

The cameras that took the images for the film are located near the pointed tip of one of the spacecraft's three solar-array arms.

They are part of Juno's Magnetic Field Investigation (MAG) and are normally used to determine the orientation of the magnetic sensors.

These cameras look away from the sunlit side of the solar array, so as the spacecraft approached the system's four cameras pointed toward Earth.

Earth and the moon came into view when Juno was about 600,000 miles away - about three times the distance between the Earth and the moon.

Timing the shots was vital as Juno was traveling almost twice as fast as a typical satellite and the spacecraft itself was spinning at two revolutions per minute.

To assemble a movie that wouldn't make viewers dizzy, the star tracker had to capture a frame each time the camera was facing Earth at exactly the right instant.

The frames were sent to Earth, where they were processed into video format.

The Waves instrument on Nasa's Juno spacecraft recorded amateur radio signals, pictured, from radio operators from around the world during the flyby in October

The star tracker’s designer, Jorgensen of the Danish Technical University, near Copenhagen, said: ‘Everything we humans are and everything we do is represented in that view.’

Juno's Waves instrument, which measures radio and plasma waves in Jupiter's magnetosphere, recorded amateur radio signals during the flyby.

Rick Nybakken, Juno project manager at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said: ‘With the Earth flyby completed, Juno is now on course for arrival at Jupiter on 4 July, 2016.’
