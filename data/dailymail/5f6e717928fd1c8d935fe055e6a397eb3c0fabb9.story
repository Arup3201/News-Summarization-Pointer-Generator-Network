Liverpool scout Neil Richardson was among the crowd at Bramall Lane on Sunday as Sheffield United pulled off a memorable fightback to beat Nottingham Forest 3-1.

Liverpool's Conor Coady, enjoying an extended loan spell at Sheffield, scored the vital 66th minute equaliser and would have earned a favourable progress report from Richardson.

However, Nottingham Forest's Jamaal Lascelles and Sheffield United's Harry Maguire were also on Richardson's radar.

Liverpool are among a growing list of clubs keen on Lascelles with Everton, Tottenham, Arsenal and Newcastle all considering whether to bid for him in the summer.

The 20-year-old has long been touted as a potential England international but niggling injuries coincided with a dip in form that was until this season where he has prospered again under Billy Davies.

Maguire, who has been watched by Chelsea, United and Southampton as well, is also 20 and a strong defender but may lack the quality in possession that Lascelles can show and that Liverpool are looking for.

Liverpool are continuing to look at other options for the summer with a left-back, second goalkeeper, winger and striker among their target positions as well as another midfielder.

Udinese striker Luis Muriel has again been watched by scouts in recent weeks but the Colombian has struggled in front of goal this season.

Man United keeping tabs on Carvalho

Manchester United scouts were again present at Sporting Lisbon where the focus of attention has been on young midfielder William Carvalho.

The combative 21-year-old Portugal international, who is signed to superagent Jorge Mendes, was booked during the 1-0 win over Olhanense with another starlet Carlos Mane scoring the decisive goal.

Under watch: Sporting defender Marcos Rojo is being monitored by Manchester United's scouts

However, United have also been monitoring Sporting's left-sided defender Marcos Rojo. The 23-year-old, who is very good on the ball and plays at left-back for Argentina, was the subject of a failed bid by Fulham in the last window.

United will lose Nemanja Vidic, with Inter Milan hoping to confirm his signature soon, while Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra are also expected to move on. Inter are also among clubs keen on 32-year-old Evra who has an option to stay at Old Trafford.

Vietto interesting Real Madrid

Real Madrid are the latest club to ask about Luciano Vietto.

A number of European clubs have expressed an interest in the 20-year-old striker from Racing Club. Vietto is looked after by Jorge Cysterpiller, the former representative of Diego Maradona, and has been likened to Sergio Aguero and Carlos Tevez.

Madrid are opening talks with Karim Benzema over a new contract but have big name options in mind should those talks stall while Vietto is seen as one who could develop with his asking price around £8million.

Everton and Liverpool have been credited with interest but Atletico Madrid's Diego Simeone who coached Vietto as a teenager is also keen.

Butland edging nearer to Leeds loan

England international goalkeeper Jack Butland will discuss a potential loan move to Leeds United later on Monday.

Stoke are willing to allow the 20-year-old to move with Asmir Begovic now back fit again and Thomas Sorensen a capable deputy.

Leeds are looking to strengthen the core of their side and want Butland to challenge Paddy Kenny for the No 1 jersey as they kick on for promotion with a takeover from Italian Massimo Cellino pending.

Butland wasan outstanding playing on loan for Barnsley against Leeds in December when he kept a clean sheet in a 0-0 draw and manager Brian McDermott is hopeful he can persuade the 6ft 5ins keeper to make the move.

Butland joined Stoke in January last year for £4million from Birmingham City. He made his England debut aged just 19, becoming the country’s youngest-ever goalkeeper, in the friendly against Italy in August 2012, having been taken to the European Championship that summer by Roy Hodgson as third-choice keeper.

Manager Mark Hughes gave Butland his Premier League chance against Everton last month and he figured against Leicester, Liverpool and Crystal Palace before Begovic returned. Hughes said: 'We are fortunate here at Stoke that we have exceptionally talented keepers at varying stage of their career. I'm very confident with Jack and I know he can perform at Premier League level.'

Leeds are also in the hunt for a striker with Sunderland's Connor Wickham and Hull's Matty Fryatt among those being considered on loan.

Eriksson keen to take Ameobi to China

Sven Goran Eriksson is keen on Newcastle striker Shola Ameobi.

The former England and Manchester City coach is now in charge at Chinese Super League side Guangzhou R&F and wants a British-style centre forward to help his side.

Ameobi's team-mate Papiss Cisse has also been courted by clubs from China as well as ones from Russia with their transfer windows closing in Russia at midnight on February 27 and 24 hours later on Friday February 28 in China.

Newcastle are in enough disarray without allowing strikers to go at this stage and departures are unlikely but that won't prevent the Chinese making a lucrative offer for Ameobi, who at 32 will consider all options.

The Newcastle striker could yet wait for the season's end before departing, when he will have more offers from England also.

At that stage Newcastle will also expect to lose Mathieu Debuchy and Hatem Ben Arfa with Inter Milan keen on the latter.

Newcastle are looking at players to replace Ben Arfa though with 21-year-old Argentine Manuel Lanzini on their scouting list. The River Plate attacking midfielder has an Italian passport and would be available for around £6million.

Fletcher attracts admirers

A host of League One sides are weighing up a summer move for York City striker Wes Fletcher.

The 22-year-old was at Manchester United and Liverpool as a boy before signing for Burnley.

However, he was unable to make the breakthrough there and took the chance to join York where he has caught the eye with some solid performances and 13 goals.

He has another year left on contract so York will be looking for around £150,000.
