Raffaele Sollecito has claimed he was not planning to flee to Austria when he was caught by police at a hotel near the national border - but had actually just returned to Italy on hearing the verdict.

The 29-year-old was feared to have been considering going on the run just hours after a court gave him a 25-year sentence for killing Meredith Kercher in 2007.

He was discovered at 1am at a hotel in Versone, between Udine and 
Tarvisio, in north-east Italy, which is just a short drive from the 
borders of Austria and Slovenia

But this afternoon he said he set off for Austria after attending court in the morning, ahead of the verdict, because he presumed he would be found innocent.

Speaking to NBC, the Italian said he was out of the country when he heard the 'unexpected' ruling and returned immediately.

'As soon as I got the news there was a guilty verdict â€¦ I came right immediately back in Italy,' he said.

'It was completely unexpected. Psychologically,
 itâ€™s devastating.'

The 29-year-old will now appeal the ruling at Italy's highest court.

'I have to fight until the end,' he added.

Judges would not order Sollecito's immediate imprisonment and only ruled that his passport should be confiscated.

Sollecito and his girlfriend - believed to be Greta Menegaldo - were stopped by police at the hotel in the small village of Versone - just a few miles from Miss Menegaldo's family home in Tarvision.

The cabinet chief of the Udine police 
station, Giovanni Belmonte, said Sollecito was calm and came willingly to the station, with his girlfriend driving behind.

They took him to the Udine police 
station, confiscated his passport and put a stamp in his Italian 
identity papers showing that he cannot leave the country. He was released this afternoon.

Asked if police thought he might have 
planned to flee the country, Belmonte said: 'We don't know his 
intentions.' But he said police were tipped off to his presence in the 
hotel and came immediately.

Raffaele Sollecito was apprehended by police at a hotel in Venzone, in between Tarvision and Udine, north-east Italy, which are close to both the borders of Austria and Slovenia

Sollecito was in court yesterday to hear the final submissions but left before the judges retired to consider the verdict.

When judges announced Sollecito's guilty verdict, they also ordered his passport be surrendered after noting that there was a 'real and actual the danger that Sollecito could escape Italian justice'.

Sollecito's U.S. attorney John Q. Kelly told the Today
 show on Friday that his client was simply staying away from media 
hotspots and had wanted to be far from the courthouse when the verdict 
was read.

Mr Kelly said that to say Sollecito was 'stunned was an understatement'.

The lawyer said no one expected the verdict in a case where there is 'no witnesses, no physical, no motive'.

He
 said that his client had chosen to be home in Italy while the court 
made its decision to 'be with family, friends and those who love and 
support him'.

It was the third trial for Knox and Sollecito, whose first two trials in the 2007 slaying of British exchange student Meredith Kercher produced flip-flop verdicts of guilty, then innocent.

After the acquittal in 2011, Knox returned to the U.S., where she evidently hoped to put herself beyond the reach of Italian law. But Italy's supreme court soon ordered a third trial.

On Thursday, the panel of two judges and six lay jury members deliberated 11 hours before issuing its decision, stiffening Knox's original 26-year sentence, apparently to take into account an additional conviction for slander, while confirming Sollecito's 25-year term.

But in Italy, verdicts are not considered final until they are confirmed, usually by the supreme Court of Cassation.  Sollecito was allowed to remain free pending the outcome of the appeal but was told to hand over his passport to authorities.

Sollecito's lawyers said they were stunned by the conviction. 'There isn't a shred of proof,' attorney Luca Maori said.

the latest Meredith Kercher murder trial, had his passport confiscated

Verdict: The judge in the courthouse of Florence reads the final guilty verdict after 11 hours of deliberations

Kercher, 21, was found dead in a pool of blood in the bedroom of the apartment she and Knox shared in the town of Perugia, where they were studying. Kercher had been sexually assaulted and her throat slashed.

Knox and Sollecito denied any involvement in the killing. After initially giving confused alibis, they insisted they were at Sollecito's apartment that night, smoking marijuana, watching a movie and making love.

Prosecutors originally argued that Kercher was killed in a drug-fueled sex game gone awry - an accusation that made the case a tabloid sensation.

But at the third trial, a new prosecutor argued that the violence stemmed from arguments between roommates Knox and Kercher about cleanliness and was triggered by a toilet left unflushed by a third defendant, Rudy Hermann Guede.

Guede, who is from the Ivory Coast, was convicted in a separate trial in a verdict that specified he did not commit the crime alone. He is serving a 16-year sentence.

Lawyers for both Knox and Sollecito have said they will appeal to the Court of Cassation.

Meanwhile, Ms Kercher's family called for Knox to be extradited from the US after the 26-year-old said the only way she would go back to Italy was 'kicking and screaming'.

The victim's brother, Lyle Kercher, told a press conference in Florence: 'If somebody is found guilty and convicted of a murder and if an extradition law exists between those two countries, then I don't see why they wouldn't.

'I imagine it would set a difficult precedent if a country such as the US didn't choose to go along with laws that they themselves uphold when extraditing convicted criminals from other countries.

'It probably leaves them in a strange position not to.'

Ms Kercher's sister Stephanie said the family was still on a 'journey for the truth' and admitted they were coming to terms with the possibility of never knowing what had happened to Meredith.

'You can't ever really get to a point where you just start to remember Meredith solely because it is following the case, coming over to Italy and everything associated with it.

'But the verdict has been upheld this time so we hope that ... obviously come the end of the trial, we are nearer the truth and an end so that we can just start to remember Meredith for who she was and draw a line under it, as it were.'

When asked if the Kercher family would want to meet Knox, she replied: 'It's not something that we would want to do at the moment and I can't say that we ever will.'
