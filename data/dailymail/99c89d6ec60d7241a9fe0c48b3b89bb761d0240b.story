United will cancel Anderson's contract to allow the midfielder to join his hometown club on a four-year deal worth £25,000 per week after tax. 

Anderson, who ended up costing United £25.7million, made a total of 181 appearances for the club – 53 as substitute – and scored nine goals.

They hoped he would grow as a player at Old Trafford after Sir Alex Ferguson signed him but his time in Manchester proved disappointing.

His final appearance  was for the under-21 side as they beat Liverpool 2-1 at Leigh Sports Village, where Victor Valdes pulled on the United shirt for the first time.

Anderson will try to reignite his career in his native Brazil as his contract in Manchester expires at the end of the season, and Louis van Gaal showed no sign of making him part of his plans.
