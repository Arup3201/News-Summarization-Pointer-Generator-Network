An Australian man joked about a skydiving plane crashing just moments before he was forced to jump from the aircraft as it plunged into a lake.

Scott Burnett, 28, was one of the 13 survivors on board a bright pink sky diving plane when it nosedived into  Lake Taupo on New Zealand's north island on Wednesday, stuff.co.nz reports.

The truck driver from Adelaide sustained just three scratches after jumping out of the plane attached to his instructor when things took a turn for the worst.

British television producer Rebekah Millichip, who lives in Sydney, was among the 13 people who had to jump from the plunging plane at Lake Taupo on New Zealand's north island on Wednesday

Bright pink Skydive Taupo plane has since been pulled from Lake Taupo after it nosedived into shallow water 

'I did have a few jokes with the guys on board on the way up about the possibility of the plane dropping into the lake, having a bit of banter, joking around,' Mr Burnett said.

'I didn't actually think a minute or two later it would actually happen.' 

The Skydive Taupo plane suffered engine problems shortly after take-off, with the pilot ordering everyone on-board to get out. 

'What was originally meant to be a 15,000 foot jump soon turned into a 1,500 foot jump (for myself),' he wrote on his Facebook.

'The others jumped out anywhere from 1,800 feet down to the pilot who jumped out last of all from his escape hatch at around 1,200 feet or so.'

There were six crew and six passengers on board. The other tourists are believed to be Dutch and Canadian

Ambulance crews reported that, remarkably, just one person required treatment for scratches after plunging into a bush

Mr Burnett was fourth out of the plane before it crashed in shallow water in the lake. 

British television producer Rebekah Millichip, who lives in Sydney, was also among the six tourists who had to jump from the plunging plane.

'The irony of my story was that I intended to skydive to overcome my fear of it. Having to emergency jump from an exploding plane completely overthrew it,' she told the New Zealand Herald.

The plane wreck has since been removed from the shallow water. Civil aviation officials and local police are continuing investigations after speaking with the skydiving company

'Watching a plane - I had ten seconds prior been sat on - crash and explode into the lake below me whilst I was still suspended mid-air was perhaps one of the most surreal moments of my life.'

There were six crew and six passengers on board. The other tourists are believed to be Dutch and Canadian.

The wreckage has since been removed from the lake and police and aviation authorities are still investigating. 

Taupo Mayor David Trewavas said the region hosted the most parachute jumps of any in the southern hemisphere, and they are carried out by 'very experienced operators'. 

There were six crew and six passengers on board, they leapt out in tandem, while the pilot jumped out when it became obvious the plane was on its way down
