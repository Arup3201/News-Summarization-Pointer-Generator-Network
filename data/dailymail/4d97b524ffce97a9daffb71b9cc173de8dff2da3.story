A man had his £5,000 Rolex watch stolen as he lay dying in hospital while doctors desperately tried to resuscitate him.

David Davies, 68, was taken by ambulance to St Richard's Hospital in Chichester, West Sussex, during the early hours of August 7 after suffering from a serious heart condition.

However, as the father was being treated in the resuscitation area next to the hospital's A&E department, his watch was stolen.

David Davies, 68, was being resuscitated at St Richard's Hospital in Chichester, West Sussex, in the early hours of August 7 after being admitted with a heart condition when his £5,000 Rolex watch (above) was stolen

Sussex Police said the watch was either stolen from his wrist or removed by doctors and placed with his belongings before later going missing. The force said he was wearing the watch when he was admitted to hospital and was still wearing it when he was taken down to the resuscitation room.

Mr Davies died a short time later and despite a thorough search of the area, and checks with staff who were on duty at the time, his watch has not yet been found.

Police have now launched an investigation into the disappearance of the family heirloom, which has devastated Mr Davies' family.

Mr Davies' son John said: 'As a family we are devastated at the loss of David and cannot believe that this has happened during our time of grief.

'We would appeal to anyone who has information about the missing watch to come forward.

'David dearly loved the watch and its loss has added to the stress and grief that the family are already going through.'

Detective Constable Mark Burgess urged anyone with information about the watch to come forward.

He said: 'This is a silver Submariner Rolex, valued at some £5,000, but even more importantly, was treated as a family heirloom having been in the family since 1985.

'If you have any information about the theft, or if you have been offered such a watch locally since last Thursday, we would very much like to hear from you.'

The Western Sussex Hospitals Foundation NHS Trust, which manages St Richard's Hospital, said it was doing everything it could to help with police enquiries.

In a statement, the trust said: 'We would like to extend our deepest sympathy to the family at this difficult time and apologise also for the loss of this valuable item while in our care.

'The hospital is doing everything it can to help the police in their enquiries, which we hope will recover the watch as quickly as possible.

'The Trust is unable to make any further comment while the police investigation is ongoing.'

Anyone with information should contact Sussex Police on 101, quoting serial 0385 of 7/8, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
