Missing: Tom Edwards, 32, vanished while returning home from a night out in Swindon, Wiltshire

A man who has not been seen for almost two days was today at the centre of a major police investigation to discover his whereabouts.

Thomas Edwards, who only married wife Dee last year, disappeared as he made the 25-mile journey home from a night out.

Police searching for the missing mortgage checker have managed to locate a signal from the his mobile phone within a three mile radius of his home address.

Today fears were growing for the 32-year-old as pals described his disappearance as 'out of character'.

Mr Edwards was last seen mixing with revellers in Rudis Bar, Swindon, between 10.30pm and 11pm on Friday.

It is believed that after leaving the bar the 32-year-old may have headed to the town's bus station where he had been due to catch the 10.30pm bus to Chippenham, Wiltshire.

It was not known if he ever got on the bus.

He never arrived home and Mr Edwards has not made any attempt to contact his wife or his family.

Friends desperately took to social networking sites to appeal for help in tracing Mr Edwards.

They also carried out their own searches in and around Swindon and handed out leaflets in a bid to find their pal.

A Twitter message from Emily Edwards said: 'Please keep spreading the word. Tom's phone signal was traced to the Chippenham area. He was last seen in Swindon.'

Mr Edwards, who is originally from Corsham, near Bath, works as mortgage checker at the Nationwide Building Society headquarters in Swindon.

Mr Edwards' wife, Dee if concerned since his disappearance is 'out of character'

Anyone with information about Mr Edwards' whereabouts was asked to contact Wiltshire Police.
