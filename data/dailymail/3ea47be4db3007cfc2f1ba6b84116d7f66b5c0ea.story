An earthquake which rocked the Channel Islands triggered more than 100 reports from shaken residents.

The 2.9 magnitude tremor follows a series of quakes in July that reached 4.3 on the Richter scale – the largest in the area since 1933.

Although there was no damage from the tremor at 10.55pm on Wednesday, residents of Jersey and Guernsey reported rattling windows and kitchen cupboards which ‘all opened and closed at the same time’. 

Rattled: Residents of St Helier, Jersey, reported signs of a quake including a phone rumbling across a table 

The British Geological Survey said its epicentre was about 16 miles south-west of St Helier with residents describing a ‘deep rumble’ that sounded like thunder.

It ‘started with a faint sound like a car pulling up outside the house then sounded like a large truck’, said one resident. Others reported hearing a 'boom' sound.

There are 200-300 earthquakes in Britain every year, but most are so small no one notices them.

Between 20 and 30 each year are over 2.0 magnitude and can be felt across a wider area. 

A spokesman for the BGS said: 'The BGS has received over 100 felt reports from members of the public across the Channel Islands via an automatic online questionnaire survey.

Epicentre: How the British Geological Survey mapped the quake in its aftermath on Wednesday night

'Most people described the shaking strength of the earthquake to be weak to moderate, with a trembling effect, and described the sound strength as moderate.

'Around half of the reports stated that windows rattled.'

The spokesman added there were noises of 'crockery clinking' and a phone on a table that 'moved several inches as if it was calling on vibrate.'
