The Prince of Wales found himself in a sticky situation as he has tried to make strawberry tarts during a visit to a family bakery.

Charles donned a white coat and hat to tour Reid’s in Thurso, Caithness, where workers watched him fill pastry cases with cream using a piping bag.

The heir to the throne, known as the Duke of 
Rothesay in Scotland, topped the cream with a strawberry and laughed as he attempted to pipe over some strawberry glaze – which unfortunately oozed out of the top of the bag.

Prince Charles made a good job of piping cream 
into the strawberry tarts. Reid's has been producing shortbread, 
biscuits and oatcakes since 1966, many of them based on 100-year-old 
recipes

The Prince of Wales starts off well, glazing the strawberry tarts properly

But he did not hold the top of the bag tight enough and strawberry glaze poured out

‘I have no idea how these things work,’ he told bakery worker Lauren MacKenzie, who performed a demonstration for him.

The
19-year-old, from Thurso, said: ‘He did very well. He didn’t grasp the 
bag tight enough at the top, but I think he did really well.’

Charlene
Banks, 18, showed the prince how to make ‘banoffee oaties’. She said: 
‘He asked what type of flour I was using and how the scales worked. He 
seemed really interested.’

Charles was also given a meringue piping  demonstration, but perhaps wisely did not try the technique himself.

Local worker Mr Newman, who has been 
with the bakery for 10 years, said: 'He asked me if it was difficult to 
do and I told him "It’s years of practice".'

The firm’s biggest-selling product is 
its all-butter shortbread, presented to the prince in a hamper along 
with toffee cake, maple and pecan oat biscuits and other treats.

Reid’s has been producing shortbread, biscuits and oatcakes since 1966, many of them based on 100-year-old recipes passed down through generations.

Donald Reid, 72, began the bakery with the help of his mother Mary Ann Reid and with recipes provided by his grandmother Margaret Ann Reid.

Now his sons Graeme and Gary help run the company which exports many of its products abroad.

Mr Reid senior said: 'When I was a wee boy I would work in the kitchen with my grandmother and turn out things, scones and the like. That’s where the beginnings of this were.'
