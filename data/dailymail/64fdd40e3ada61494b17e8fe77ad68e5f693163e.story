The California drought may force members of the state and federal government to move more than 15 million salmon to the safety of the ocean using giant tanker trucks.

The drought, which is thought to be California's worst dry spell of the last century, has caused many rivers to dry up, meaning that young salmon are unable to migrate to the ocean.

Officials from state and federal wildlife authorities have concocted a plan to move the millions of young fish from the Coleman Fish Hatchery near Redding closer to the ocean.

At risk: The millions of salmon being potentially moved in California come from fisheries and reservoirs, and the drought has meant that the young fish will not be able to swim the river to the ocean to conduct their growth cycle

John McManus of the Golden Gate Salmon Association told NBC Los Angeles: 'The juvenile fish this year represent the adult fish that will support our fishery in 2016.

'They'll put them in tanker trucks and move them down to the Delta or the Bay and unload them in acclamation pens.

'If we get fish moved by truck, survival rate goes way up, and giving the juvenile fish a lift will help keep the salmon fishery afloat.'

Before: In 2011, the Californian dam was almost full, sitting at a capacity of 97 percent

After: The capacity of Folsom Lake in January was just 17 percent, a whopping 80 percent lower than what it was 2.5 years ago

California's drought continues to worsen, with ten rural communities identified as having fewer than 60 days' supply of water

The plan does come with a significant amount of risk to the fish, as the young salmon will not have made the journey from river to ocean, and so might not be able to find their way back to spawn.

However, federal officials believe the severity of the drought brings even higher risk to the fish, as dry rivers blocks natural migration, putting both the Californian species, and an entire industry of salmon fisheries, to risk.

If drought conditions remain as severe as they have been, the salmon transportation could begin in April.

The drought has severely damaged a lot of the landscape, with many agricultural sectors unable to provide water to growing crops

The drought in California has been so bad that in January Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency due to increasing arid conditions, asking for a 20 per cent reduction in water use.

The rain in California has been 20 per cent less that usual, and the 'snow pack' in the area (snow from the winter that melts as it gets warmer, filling up reserviors) has also been drastically low.

So far the drought has caused reservoirs and rivers to dry up, putting household water usage at risk.

Increasingly arid conditions have hit almost every agricultural industry in California, from avocado growth, to the wine trade

In some parts of California, around 225,000 homes and businesses are not charged for how much water they use, and are instead charged a flat rate, meaning that some use up to 100 gallons of water a day.

Due to the drought, some town authorities have ordered citizens to drop their water usage by around 25 per cent.

A San Francisco Bay area town was the first to ration their water back in January, ordering a 25 per cent mandatory water cut, in the wake of state authorities warning that California could run out of water in 100 days if the drought continued.

Some towns in California are taking much more severe measures, with St. Helena instituting fines of $1000 for those who go over a 65 gallon-a-day limit.

On the edge: The drought has been putting the salmon fishery industry, and the California fishmongers, at risk

Businesses have also come under restraint, with restaurants being told not to serve water to diners unless specifically asked.

However, the drought may hit the agriculture sector in California the hardest, with 80 per cent of the water used in California going towards the industry.

Many people have called the drought 'the worst dry spell in a century', comparing it to the droughts of the 1970s, where people were forced to severely ration water.

In addition, the dry conditions of the drought combined with the weather warming up dramatically increases the risk of wildfires across California, which are incredibly hard to fight with a mandatory restriction on water usage, and can ravage landscapes and destroy communities.

Risk of forest fires and wildfires has increased dramatically because of the drought, as a lack of water dries out trees, and hot weather increases the risk of spontaneous fires

A local NBC News station told MailOnline: 'We had a damn good batch of rain a week ago.

'This meant the worry died down a little, but the drought is still prevalent, except now we might lose federal help.

'The past year's drought has been really bad, and the recent rain fall has only stopped the story from being huge, but the drought is still there.'
