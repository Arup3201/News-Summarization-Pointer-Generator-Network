Salford half-back Theo Fages has accepted a two-match ban for foul play.

The France international admitted a grade C charge of making dangerous contact on Castleford hooker Adam Milner during Red Devils' 30-16 defeat by the Tigers last Friday.

Fages' ban will start with Thursday's home game against Widnes.

Castleford forwards Nathan Massey and Matt Cook will miss Friday's home game against Hull after being given one-match bans for striking in the same match.

Cook submitted an early-guilty plea while Massey was found guilty by a disciplinary tribunal and also fined £300.

It was the first suspension of Massey's career and was imposed despite the support of his 'victim' Rangi Chase.

'Want to say thanks to @Rangi06Chase for submitting a letter to help us in are appeal,' Massey tweeted. 'didnt have to wanted to help out, class act.'
