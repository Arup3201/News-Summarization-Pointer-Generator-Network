We've already had apps and gadgets that stop you from posting Facebook statuses or sending texts when you're drunk - but the latest actively encourages it.

Called Livr, it is a social network that is only available through an app, and users can only access that app when they’re drunk.

It works with a breathalyser that plugs into the charging port of an iOS or Android device.

Livr is a social network that is only available through an app, and users can only access that app when they're drunk. It works with a breathalyzer, pictured, that plugs into the charging port of an iOS or Android device. To open the app, users blow on the breathalyzer to get a blood alcohol content (BAC) reading

Truth or Dare: A game in which users get points for 
participating in certain tasks

Drunk Dial: This feature randomly 
calls a number of another Livr user - even strangers.

Hot Spots: A map that plots the nearest bars and clubs. Large
 spots are busy venues, based on how many people using 
Livr are currently at that location. Each ‘spot’ on the map is also 
colour coded based on how drunk the user at the venue is.

Blackout: Pressing the Blackout button wipes all evidence, including photos and call history, from the device. 

Morning After Report: This can be sent to other users showing off any antics from the previous night.

To open the app, users blow on the breathalyser to get a blood alcohol content (BAC) reading.

If their BAC is above the legal limit for driving, the app and social network opens. The higher the BAC, the more features that are unlocked.

These features include a Truth or Dare game, in which users get points for participating in certain tasks, and a Drunk Dial option that randomly calls the number of another Livr user - even strangers.

The Hot Spots feature is map that plots the nearest bars and clubs.

Large spots are busy venues, and this is taken from how many people using Livr are currently at that location.

The final feature of the app, designed to be used at the end of a night, is the Blackout button, pictured. Pressing the button wipes all evidence, including photos and call history, from the device. Alternatively, a Morning After report can be sent to other users showing off any antics from the previous night

Photos are only uploaded to the app and can only be seen by other drunk people.

Creators Kyle Addison and Avery Platz said: ‘The current state of social media is not a fun place to be; your Mum’s on there, your boss is on there.

‘People are only putting up baby photos, and engagement photos, and nothing else.

'[We] think everyone is trying to put their best face forward and showing themselves as this perfect person - but no-one is perfect.

‘People get a little wild, people do stupid things and that’s what makes them interesting.

'That’s what Livr is here to capitalise on.’

‘The beauty of the Blackout button is that encourages anybody using Livr to just go nuts; to have a real good time; to be themselves - to not censor themselves,’ explained Platz.

Alternatively, a Morning After Report can be sent to other users showing off any antics from the previous night.

The Livr app isn't available for download yet, and the website claims it will be available from 'spring.'

It is unclear whether the app is a concept, or even a parody, and MailOnline has contacted the developers to find out more.

A disclaimer at the bottom of the Livr site says: 'The app is intended for responsible adults of legal drinking age. It is purely intended for entertainment purposes.

'Do not drink and drive. Do not drink excessively. Excessive consumption of alcohol may cause irreparable damage or harm to your body and may be lethal.'
