Want to get fitter, faster? Then the new Insanity classes rolling out across British gyms could be for you.

The hardcore American workout practised by Demi Lovato is focussed on high-intensity interval training (HIIT). She famously tweeted: 'Just did the #Insanity workout DVD... Amazing.. So intense but I loved it!'

Insanity is usually practiced at home on DVD, but for British gym bunnies lacking discipline,  a 45-minute gym class has launched where you're put through your paces with the promise of a possible 1,000-calorie burn. To put that into perspective, a spinning class burns just 331 in the same amount of time.

The cardio-based, total-body conditioning programme and is based on 'max 
interval training', supposedly a faster way of burning calories.

Traditional
 HIIT workouts, which can burn up to 750 calories in 45 minutes, feature short 
bursts of maximum intensity with longer periods of 
rest. But Insanity flips that formula upside-down by combining 
lengthier periods of high intensity exercise with shorter cool downs.

And now, developers Beachbody have 
taken the principles of the successful Insanity home DVD to create the 
'ultimate HIIT class', available at select gyms across Britain including
 the swanky Reebok Sports Club and thirtysevendegrees Olympia, from April onwards.

Taking place in studios with an instructor, the equipment-free classes involve non-stop strenuous stamina training and claim to improve fitness in 60 days, if practiced weekly.

Insanity classes target the entire 
body, beginning with an accelerated warmup and moving into three intense
 blocks of work, each one targeting a different element of fitness.

First is plyometrics and endurance -
 essentially 'jump training' where muscles exert maximum force in as 
short a time as possible. Then the class moves on to strength and 
balance before the final section on agility and co-ordination. You 
finish with eight minutes of functional core work and a stretch.

I headed to the Reebok gym full of enthusiasm after having recently vowing to start working out three times a week to improve my fitness.

I'd heard it was one of the hardest workouts out there and although I was a little intimidated, I was keen to get stuck in.

Once we got going I found it very hard and very quick. The moves were faster than any speed I'm comfortable moving at (a bit like when Spinning instructors tell you to sprint when you're knackered). Lots of floor work, burpees, jumps, lunges - everything in max-impact mode. No easing you in.

I found myself slipping over once in a while and also taking the low-impact option on a few occasions. Everyone else in the class, though, was committed to the workout and pushed themselves to the max.

The class was held in a giant gleaming studio and once we got going I found it very jumpy and quick

After the shakes and exhaustion surpassed, the workout was ultimately satisfying. If I kept it up, I could surely get up to the level of my fellow gym-goers.

As long as your health is good don't be afraid to push yourself for real results. An instructor will always ask if you have any injuries and advise on low-impact variations to suit, but, generally, we can achieve more than we think we're capable of, and Insanity's the proof. At least in the gym.

Would I go back? Were I a member of Reebok, yes, for sure. I'd do this once a week as I think variety is key, and this class seems like a golden addition to any fitness regime. That bit you dread but the push you need.

Participants work out at the very limits of their capability for three to four minute bursts of intense, dynamic exercises, which are spaced with rests or 'cools down' for
 about 30 seconds, before the whole process is repeated.

Instructors provide low-impact options for each move so the class is accessible to all fitness levels.

'Adding high-intensity exercise 
forces the body to use fast-twitch muscle fibers not normally engaged in
 cardio exercise,' explains a spokesperson for Insanity.

'These
 fast-twitch fibers continue burning fuel even during lower-intensity 
exercise. Insanity's high-intensity activity forces the body to work for
 longer periods of time at a higher capacity than traditional workouts.

'People experience faster
 increases in cardiovascular fitness, and burn carbohydrates and fat 
more efficiently - as much as 1,000 calories per hour, with the enhanced 
calorie burn lasting anywhere from three to 24 hours after completion of the
 workout.'

As a result, the workout, developed by personal trainer Shaun T. in 2009, claims to be the most effective workout programmes around.
