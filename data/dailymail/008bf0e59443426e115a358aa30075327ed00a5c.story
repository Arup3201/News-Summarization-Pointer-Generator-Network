Basketball star Baron Davis claims he recently had a run-in with aliens in the California desert.

Davis, who hasn't played since picking up a serious injury staring for the New York Knicks in May 2012, revealed all about his unusual experience in a recent podcast.

‘I was actually abducted by aliens two weeks ago,’ he told west coast hip hop website Westcoastrydaz.com.

When his hosts asked for more details, he explained he that had been driving from Las Vegas to Los Angeles in the early hours of the morning what the incident happened.

‘I see this light and it’s a big a**truck. And I said, oh f**k this is going to be traffic,’ he said.

‘Driving, driving and the next thing you know there’s a steel thing and these crazy looking people – half human, half ugly-looking mother f*****s.

‘They were poking me on the nose, looking at my eyes, they had my hands tied and the next thing you know I was in Montabello dude, burning rubber on the way back to L.A. at 4 o’clock in the morning.’

Despite the unlikely nature of the incident, the two-time NBA All-Star sounded deadly serious and he stood by his claim even when his hosts asked him repeatedly if it was true.

Davis said he couldn’t explain how he traveled so far, so quickly and said after his ordeal was over he  had to go to a nearby In N Out Burger to calm down. He said he ate two burgers while shaking profusely and wondering what had happened to him.

‘I don’t think it was an abduction cause now I am sharper and s**t. I am retaining information,’ Davis said.

Drafted as the third pick in 1999 by the Charlotte Hornets, Davis went on to play for the Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Clippers and Cleveland Cavaliers before signing with New York as a free agent in 2011.

Outside of the sport he has acted in movies such as 'The Cookout' and guest-starred on TV shows 'Lincoln Heights' and 'The Forgotten'. He is a member of the Screen Actors Guild.
