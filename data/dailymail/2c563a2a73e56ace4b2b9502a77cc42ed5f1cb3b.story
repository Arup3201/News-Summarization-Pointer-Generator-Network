A grandfather fatally stabbed in the back as he walked home from a mosque may have been the victim of a racist attack, police said yesterday as they released CCTV footage of a white man fleeing the scene.

Muhammed Saleem, 75, was stabbed three times and stamped on as he made his way back from his local mosque on Monday evening.

The father of seven, described as a ‘highly respected’ figure in the community, was found by horrified neighbours in a pool of blood just yards from his front door in Small Heath, Birmingham.

He was pronounced dead in hospital later that night.

Yesterday the officer leading the investigation into the death of the retired baker admitted racism was a ‘significant line of inquiry’.

Police have released CCTV footage of a white man seen running away from the scene of the attack, as well as footage of a white or silver minibus or people carrier which was seen driving along the route between the murder scene and the mosque around the time of the attack.

Respected member of the community: Muhammed Saleem Chaudhry, 75 who was stabbed to death in Small Heath, Birmingham, and a man caught on CCTV running away from the scene

Officers released the footage of this man and are urging the public for help to identify him

They have appealed for anybody with 
information about either the man or the vehicle, which appeared to have 
two men inside, to come forward.

At a press conference yesterday, two of Mr Saleem’s five daughters paid a tearful tribute.

Shazia Khan, 45, said she believed 
her father was the victim of a ‘pre-planned’ attack, adding: ‘He was 
attacked from behind – the intent was to kill, not to maim.

‘My father was not a political man, 
he was deeply religious, but he wasn’t involved in campaigning and 
rallying. He was just a normal old man – he had no enemies and no one 
had a reason to target him.

‘People in the area are saying it 
must be a white supremacist group. You don’t really get white people 
here, but the man caught on film was definitely white.’

Grieving: Mr Chaudhry's daughters appeal for witnesses following the stabbing of their father

Nazia Maqsood, 
44, broke down in tears as she told of the ‘unbearable’ ordeal her 
father had been through.

She said: ‘It’s difficult for us to accept the brutality of what has happened.’

The sisters said they had ‘no idea’ why their father may have been targeted.

Mr Saleem suffered from arthritis and was walking with a stick when he was attacked. His wallet was not taken.

He had been married to Said, 69, for 
50 years and the couple had 22 grandchildren.

Yesterday Detective 
Superintendent Mark Payne warned the killer ‘we will find you and come 
through your door’ as he appealed for anybody with information about the
‘vicious and cowardly’ attack to come forward.

Racially motivated? Detectives have launched a murder inquiry after 75-year-old Muhammed 
Saleem Chaudhry was stabbed to death in this lane in Small Heath, 
Birmingham

Police officers were called by the ambulance service to Little Green 
Lane, in the Small Heath area of the city, shortly after 10.30pm on Monday, after 
reports the pensioner had suffered serious injuries

The scene in Little Green lane with the junction of Arsenal Street, 
Small Heath, Birmingham, where a highly respected member of the community was stabbed to death

He said: ‘This is a very, very 
unusual occurrence. Mr Saleem was stabbed in the back and there were no 
defence wounds which means it happened very quickly with no chance for 
him to defend himself.

‘This is why we are less  inclined to believe it is a robbery gone wrong.

‘Somebody must have had a very good reason to stab Mr  Saleem.

‘We have no evidence that this was a 
racist attack but clearly that is a very significant line of inquiry. It
is something that we must explore.’

Det Supt Payne also acknowledged that it was possible Mr Saleem had been deliberately targeted.

The stabbing happened in Little Green Lane in Small Heath, two miles from Birmingham city centre

He added: ‘Mr Saleem walked to and from the mosque five times each day.

‘If somebody wanted to attack him, 
that would have provided the ideal opportunity as it was a route he 
travelled at similar times every day.

‘He was a defenceless pensioner returning home from evening prayers. It’s a despicable attack.’

’The CCTV footage, shot from a 
commercial business, shows a white man between the ages of 25 and 32 
running down a side road off Little Green Lane, where Mr Saleem was 
stabbed. He was wearing a ‘distinctive’ ribbed or striped beanie hat.

An inquest into Mr Saleem’s death is due to open today.
