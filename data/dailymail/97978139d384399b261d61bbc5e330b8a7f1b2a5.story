A former principal is being sued after allegedly beating a five-year-old elementary school pupil with a paddle, leaving him badly bruised and terrified to return to classes, it emerged today.

Elizabeth Boyd, ex-principal of the Sunbright Elementary School in Tennessee, is being sued for $1.7million by parents Sandra Hall and Jason Williams over the treatment of their son Lukas last year.

The couple said that although they had given verbal permission for their son to be gently swatted if he misbehaved, they claim Dr Boyd hit the boy eight times with a paddle because he had thrown some crayons.

She is out on bond but was removed indefinitely from her teaching role on August 31.

The educator had been moved to an assistant principal role at Central Middle School, sparking protests among parents there.
