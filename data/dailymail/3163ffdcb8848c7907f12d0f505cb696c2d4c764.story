Tom Cruise reunited with his daughter Suri in New York today for the first time since his split from wife Katie Holmes.

Shooting on the actor's latest movie Oblivion wrapped in California yesterday and the 50-year-old flew to New York overnight to see his youngest child.

The six-year-old cuddled her father with one arm and clutched a soft toy in the other as he carried her into the Greenwich Hotel.

They later emerged, seemingly having 
changed outfits, with Suri switching from casual red flip-flops into a 
pair of burnt red patent flats - although her orange dress remained the 
same.

Tom also seemed to have freshened up, wearing a navy T-shirt instead of a light blue shirt.

His sister Cass Mapother was also seen arriving at the establishment with toys in tow.

Tom had no contact with Katie when he made a five 
minute visit to her apartment to collect their child earlier this morning, according to TMZ.

Tom and Suri were last spotted in public
together on June 16, when they dined at Sushi Samba in Reykjavik, 
Iceland, along with Katie. 

It was no doubt an emotional reunion for father and daughter, who have been keeping in touch via phone and video chat in recent weeks.

It would have been even more poignant given last night's scare which saw Katie and Suri involved in a car accident, capping off a tumultuous time for the little girl.

The former Dawson's Creek actress and daughter  were riding in the back of a black Mercedes 
sedan when it was struck by a dump truck in New York yesterday evening.

No one was reported hurt in the incident, which onlookers say was minor.

One source said: “It was nothing major other than the fact that it was Katie Holmes.'

Police
arrived on the scene and noted the actress' chauffeur-driven vehicle 
had sustained a large dent and several scratches to the rear driver side
panel after the Volvo truck - from Classic Sanitation Recycling New 
York Corp - had apparently backed into the luxury vehicle.

Katie - who filed for divorce from 
her daughter's father, actor Tom Cruise, last month - and Suri were not 
seen at the scene of the crash.

Last week the Mission Impossible star's 
lawyer, Bert Fields said the actor was eager to be with his daughter 
again, adding: 'Tom loves Suri very, very much, as he does his other two
children. Tom is a family man, and dedicated to his children. They are 
the centre of his world.'

Tom's older children Isabella, 19, and 
17-year-old Connor from his marriage to Nicole Kidman have both been 
spending time with him in recent weeks, including sombre birthday 
celebration on July 3.

Following her split from Tom on June 29, Katie has secured primary custody of their little girl in an undisclosed divorce agreement.

It was recently revealed she has 
enrolled Suri into New York's Convent of the Sacred Heart School.

The conservative school - where
former pupils include Lady Gaga and Paris Hilton - was chosen because the actress 
wants her daughter to have a Catholic education, rather than being 
taught at a Scientology school as the Mission: Impossible star desired.
