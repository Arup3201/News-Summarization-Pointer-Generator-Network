An ex-wife has described the terrifying moment she watched the door handle to her bungalow going down 'very slowly' before her ex husband burst in and tried to kill her.

Debbie Walerysiak was sitting in the kitchen of her home in Woodplumpton, near Preston, when ex-husband Paul Walerysiak launched his vicious attack.

He has now been jailed for 18 years for the attack which happened in September last year, 10 years after they split up.

She said she was sitting at the kitchen table in her bungalow when Walerysiak arrived at her home.

'I turned to my right where the back 
door is and I thought I could see the handle going down very slowly,' she said.

'I kept my eye on the handle and 
started to get out of the chair, walking towards the door. I started 
panicking a little. I'm talking seconds.

'I moved over to the door. I could see
the handle going down further. I did realise there was a person through
the glass. Within seconds I realised it was my ex-husband.

'He burst in and he was swearing at 
me. I didn't know if there was anything in his hand. It was very 
frenzied, very quick. I didn't know what was happening. I moved around 
the kitchen table. I ended up on the floor. He was hurting me.

'I just thought he was punching me - I
didn't know what was going on. I felt like I was being pummelled. He 
never let up from the minute he came through the door. It was 
relentless. I knew by all this bleeding I could feel that I could end up
getting killed.'

When the attack finally came to an end, Mrs Walerysiak went round the house locking all the doors and windows as she waited for the emergency services to arrive.

Preston Crown Court heard that the couple married in 1985 but split up 'out of the blue' in 2002 when he sold his business to buy the bungalow and renovate it.

She said that there had been no previous history of domestic violence and Mrs Walerysiak described her ex-husband as 'laid-back, jovial and placid' throughout their marriage.

Walerysiak denied being the attacker but was convicted after a trial. He said on the night of the attack he walked to a friend's house only to later find his car had been stolen. But a set of car keys for his BMW were found at the back door of his ex-wife's house.

Defending him, Philip Parry said: 'It is not in his nature to resort to threats or aggressive behaviour. There was no build up, no warning, no anything a witness he was with him didn't seem inclined to the opinion that anything was brewing.

'Looking at his behaviour over the last 10 years in which he has been separated, and 18 years before that were married, there is nothing to suggest that he is a dangerous person or a danger to the public.'

Judge Stuart Baker told Walerysiak: 'Clearly this was premeditated attack.

'First you armed yourself with a knife to take as a weapon, you drove for about three miles and you were careful to leave your car about half a mile away and no doubt you would have returned to it if you had not lost your keys in the back garden.

'Your victim was vulnerable the attack came as a total surprise and shock to her because it took place in her home, there was no refuge to seek and nowhere for her to go or to ask for help.

'Your former wife may have taken any opportunity to vilify you after what happened but in fact she did quite the reverse. She told police you were not a man of violence and in your marriage to her she remembers you as being laid-back, jovial and placid.

'If an artery had been severed in this attack her injuries would have likely to have been far worse. Inevitably she will have some scarring and she will inevitably remember this for a very long time into the future.'

After the case Detective Constable James Ullystone of Lancashire Police said: 'This was an unprovoked frenzied attack and has been a horrific ordeal for Debbie.

'It is testament to the courage and bravery of Debbie that a dangerous man has been taken off the streets.'
