QPR striker Charlie Austin is set to miss just one match after limping away from Loftus Road on crutches after their 1-0 defeat to Southampton on Saturday.

A long-term injury to their 13-goal top scorer would have been disastrous for the west Londoners in their bid to survive in the Barclays Premier League.

However, a statement released on the club's official Twitter account on Sunday morning read: '@chazaustin9 has suffered bruising to his right foot and will miss Tuesday's trip to @SunderlandAFC. Nothing too serious #QPR.'

QPR striker and top goalscorer Charlie Austin could be out with injury for the rest of the season

Austin has been in superb form for The Hoops this season and has scored 13 goals in 19 league games

And Austin himself followed that up by tweeting: 'Scan done. Delighted to say I've NOT broken a bone in my foot! Hopefully back in a week or two!' 

It had initially been feared he could be out for the rest of the season after the Queens Park Rangers striker left Loftus Road on crutches after the game.

The 25-year-old played the full 90 minutes against Southampton but was in discomfort as he left the ground.

His team-mate Joey Barton tweeted a picture of Austin on Sunday, and added: 'Great to see @chazaustin9 is off the life support and is now getting his nail varnish re-applied...'

Fellow QPR player Richard Dunne, meanwhile, has been ruled out for three months with a knee injury. .

Dunne twisted his knee and had to be substituted in the 83rd minute after a block tackle on Sadio Mane, who scored the winner for Southampton in the 93rd minute.

QPR will be without experienced defender Richard Dunne for three months after he suffered a knee injury
