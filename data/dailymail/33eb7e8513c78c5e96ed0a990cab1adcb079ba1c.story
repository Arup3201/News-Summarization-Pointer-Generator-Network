Tarik Hassane is among five young men arrested on suspicion of terror offences 

A Muslim medical student arrested during terror raids in London complained that incest and homosexuality in the UK was rife before being taken in by police, it has been reported. 

Tarik Hassane, 20, was among four young men arrested by Metropolitan Police this week as part of an ongoing investigation into terrorist offences. 

The group is thought to have been orchestrating the first UK-based Islamic extremist attack since the spread of ISIS.  

The medical student, who was studying in Sudan before returning to London this summer, shared his views on Islam on Twitter and by answering young Muslims' questions on an ask.fm page. 

On one occasion, he is believed to have said that jihadist fighters in Syria were 'fulfilling the greatest deed in Islam,' the Sunday Times reports. 

But in a separate response, he told followers he was 'not with ISIS'. 

'I don't know about ISIS, I'm not with them and know barely anything about them.' 

Later he reveals he will not be waging jihad anytime soon and wants to make his parents 'happy'. 

Hassane is one of five friends arrested in west London last week as part of an ongoing investigation into terrorist offences. Yasir Mahmoud, Rawan Kheder, Gusai Abuzeid and a fifth man who cannot be named for legal reasons, were also taken into custody. 

The 20-year-old, who claims to be half Moroccan and half Saudi, was arrested following a tweet sent to his friends which read 'Oi lads... I smell war'.

It was claimed he had recently been in Syria and returned to the UK, though friends dispute the post was related to a suspected terrorist plot, insisting he is not a violent person.  

Following the men's arrest, Metropolitan Police were granted a warrant for further detention until October 14. 

All are thought to have attended Westminster City School for Boys and are UK nationals. 

Hassane's arrest sparked controversy online with thousands of Twitter users citing a #JusticeforTarik hashtag when he was detained. 

They claimed he was sharing a joke with friends when he wrote the post and not referring to ongoing tensions between extremist Muslims and the West.
