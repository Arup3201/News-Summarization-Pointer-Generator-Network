A woman who had her phone stolen will be reunited with it after the selfie of the man who handed it into police that appeared on her Facebook wall went viral.

Nicola Shelton, 33, was partying with friends at Lala Land in Byron Bay, on the New South Wales' north coast, on Valentine's Day when her bag was stolen with her phone, wallet and cards inside.

She thought she would never see her iPhone again, but then on Wednesday someone posted a selfie of themselves at Byron Bay on her Facebook wall.

Nicola Shelton got a shock when a man taking a selfie appeared on her Facebook wall without her knowledge

Earlier in February her phone had been stolen in Byron Bay and she started sharing the selfie to get her phone back

Ms Shelton's boyfriend alerted the Melbourne woman to the post while she at work.

'It was an awful feeling [seeing the photo]. My boyfriend asked "why are you posting photos of these boys on your Facebook page?"' she told Daily Mail Australia.

The photo shows a picture of man smiling at the camera while another climbs over rocks at the beach in the background.

At first, Ms Shelton thought the man in the picture was the one who stole her phone and re-posted the photo in an attempt to get her phone back.

Almost two weeks later, the selfie appeared on her Facebook wall and Ms Shelton thought the man in it stole her phone, but he later apologised - saying he had bought the phone off someone else

'Straight after I saw it I re-shared it and changed the subject to "This is the person who has my iPhone" and it started gaining momentum,' she said.

So far, the post has been shared on social media almost 20,000 times.

'I was absolutely dumbfounded. At first when I re-shared photo I didn't think anything would come from it,' Ms Shelton said.

'But people were messaging me and wishing me luck, people I didn't know, it was bizarre.'

After the post started to gain traction, the man in the photo messaged Ms Shelton on Facebook and apologised.

He said he saw her sharing his photo and had bought her phone off someone else.

The man told Ms Shelton he was going to hand the phone over to the police.

To her relief, she got a call from Byron Bay police and the phone will soon be returned to its owner.

'I’m just amazed by the help from people I don't even know. I'm happy to get my phone back,' Ms Shelton told Daily Mail Australia.
