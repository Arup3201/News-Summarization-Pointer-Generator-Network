The world's best chainsaw sculptors have gone head-to-head turning plain chunks of logs into jaw-dropping pieces of art.

Sculptors from Australia were joined by those from New Zealand, Germany, Japan, Canada and the U.S. at the three-day Australian Chainsaw Carving Championship at Mount Dandenog, just outside Melbourne.

Kicking off on Friday, the first two days of the event saw some amazing pieces produced, including bearded swagmen, a giant lyrebird, an owl, a seahorse and a cockatoo with huge crest.

Men and women from across the world have gone head-to-head as they create intricate pieces as part of the competition

From the plain pieces of wood, sculptors transform the lifeless chunks into human figures with intricate details such as beards, mustaches and hats. Â 

And despite the ferocious sound of the chainsaws, which required the competitors to wear protective earmuffs and eye wear, the pieces demonstrate amazing finesse and show off complex detailing.

Sending sawdust flying, keen onlookers, also wearing protective gear, were able to watch the unbelievable creations be made before their eyes.

With the original chunks of wood towering over the sculptors, they use step ladders to reach and work on the top parts.

As part of the carving process, the competitors shave off larger pieces of wood in sections with the chainsaws, until they have made the general form of their sculptures.

They then focus on the elaborate detailing, such as the individual feathers on the birds or facial features and the chainsaw to carefully smooth the wood.

Lined up side-by-side as they compete to create the most impressive carvings, all the artworks will be auctioned on online, with proceeds going to charity.

Day three of the competition concludes on Sunday.
