As pile-ups go, this was probably the most expensive car crash in history.

Three Lamborghinis worth a total of around £650,000 went up in flames when they crashed together at 70mph.

The supercars were travelling in a convoy from Singapore to a car show in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur when disaster struck.

Crash: Flames erupt from the mustard-coloured Lamborghin on the expressway in Malaysia destroying all three supercars which were wortha total of £650,000

Fire officials said one of the vehicles veered from its lane on the north-south expressway near Seremban, 35 miles from the capital, into the two other cars.

The fire wrecked a Lamborghini Aventador, worth an estimated £288,000 and two Gallardos priced at about £360,000.

Two other Lamborghinis in the same convoy were unscathed in the crash at 9:55am local time on Thursday. All the drivers and passengers escaped injury.

Fire chief Norazam Khamis told NBC News he did not think the vehicles were breaking the speed limit of 110kmh.

One of the cars was almost completely destroyed by the fire and the other two were damaged beyond repair.

Eyewitnesses said one car appeared to lose control and slammed into the road barrier, causing two cars behind it to crash into it. The Aventador was pinned against the guardrail by the other two.

Two fire engines and 14 firefightersl arrived at the scene within minutes after receiving the alert, but were too late to save the supercars.
