Plea: Alessandra Pacchieri with her baby, whose identity has been obscured for legal reasons

The mother whose baby  daughter was snatched by social workers after a forced caesarean has written a poignant letter to her ‘little Princess’ promising never to forget her.

Alessandra Pacchieri begged the Daily Mail last night to pass the letter to her 15-month-old girl, now being cared for by Essex social services and being lined up for new adoptive parents against the mother’s wishes.

‘I want to tell my daughter what I feel and how much I care,’ said Miss Pacchieri, 35, from her home town near Siena, Italy. ‘I am not allowed to speak to her or see her any more and, if she is adopted, this letter may be the last time I can get a message to her.’

In near perfect English and on paper dotted with drawings of hearts, the letter tells her daughter: ‘I miss you so so so much.’ Miss Pacchieri writes that ‘I pray God every day to protect you’ and describes her hopes that they will be reunited one day. The letter goes on: ‘Please always remember that I LOVE you and I wanted you to be with me.’

Miss Pacchieri, who has two other daughters, is at the centre of a major international row over a UK family court’s secret decision to force her, without her consent, to have a caesarean in an Essex NHS hospital on August 24 last year before her baby was removed by social workers for adoption.

Miss Pacchieri was seven months pregnant and on a training course at Stansted airport to be an air hostess when she had a panic attack and called the police for help. She had stopped taking her medicine for a bipolar complaint in case it harmed her unborn child.

Officers took her to hospital where she was sectioned under the Mental Health Act and, later, was forced to have a caesarean under anaesthetic so she could not protest.

She told the Mail: ‘I was marched into a hospital operating theatre and pushed on to a bed. They put a mask over my face. When I woke up the baby had arrived.’

Heartfelt: Miss Pacchieri says it may be the 'last time I can get a message to her'

Miss Pacchieri has seen her baby ten times. On the last occasion, in May this year, she was told to say a final goodbye to her daughter by social workers at a council centre in Essex. The child was introduced to prospective new parents in October and has since seen the couple regularly in preparation for her planned adoption in the next few weeks.

Italian and English lawyers acting for Miss Pacchieri are preparing to challenge the adoption plan.The case has caused an uproar and is now being overseen by Sir James Munby, England’s most senior family judge.

Miss Pacchieri has told the Mail that she has sent previous letters to her daughter. But she fears they have not been read to the child by Essex social workers.

Dear Love,

I miss you so so so much and I think about you all the times.

I wonder how you are doing and what are you doing.

I pray God every day to protect you, keep you away from evil and to bless you.

You are my little princess. I did not see you since May and I can imagine how big you are right now!

I pray God that one day you could reunify with me and your sisters cause we love you so much. I want the best for you and I wish they would have give us a home to be together.

I don’t know when I am gonna see you again but I know that one day we will... I am positive about that and I have faith.

Please always remember that I LOVE you and I wanted you to be with me. I send you all my love and pray that our angel will look after you.

Your mother

At an English court hearing this spring, the judge said she was intelligent and articulate.

However, he ruled that because Miss Pacchieri might stop her bipolar drugs at some time during her daughter’s childhood, the adoption should go ahead.

A spokesman for Essex social services promised the mother’s letter would be passed to the child if Miss Pacchieri sends it to social workers from Italy. The spokesman insisted that previous letters had not arrived.
