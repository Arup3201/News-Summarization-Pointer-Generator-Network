The Tony Pulis trademark look has already set in at the Hawthorns, with his new side West Brom running out of navy baseball caps in their club shop.

The former Stoke and Crystal Palace boss, who has won his opening two matches in charge of the Baggies, is a big fan of donning the tracksuit and baseball cap look on the touchline.

And despite a brief stint wearing a suit - during his first game in charge against Gateshead in the FA Cup - it didn't take long for the 56-year-old to return to his more favourable look.

Pulis returned to his trademark look for the crucial win against Hull City on Saturday, with some sparking while Adidas Flux trainers also on show.

That sparked huge popularity of the Pulis look amongst Baggies fans, with all of the navy brand getting snapped up, forcing the club to place a new order.

A club shop employer confirmed they had sold out of all the navy caps, but still have them available in grey.

Martin Swain, director of communications at the club, added: 'The baseball cap is the Tony Pulis trademark and our fans have taken to it. Hopefully it will become the emblem of a good second half of the season.'
