Sami Khedira was ruled out of the World Cup final after suffering a calf injury in Germany's warm up at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro, but didn't have to look far to be cheered up.

The Real Madrid midfielder had model girlfriend Lena Gercke to fall back on after being ruled out of the showdown with Argentina, who was watching on from the crowd.

The injury forced manager Joachim Low to put 
Christoph Kramer in the side for his first-ever competitive start, but the 23-year-old lasted just half an hour himself.

Disappointed: Lena Gercke, Khedira's girlfriend, was in the crowd for the World Cup final in Rio de Janeiro

Plan B: It isn't all bad for Khedira, who gets to watch the final with Gercke instead of playing

Kramer couldn't have asked for a bigger game to make his first start in, but looked relaxed in the build up as he spun the ball on his finger in the tunnel.

The youngster, though, was injured after clashing his head with Ezequiel Garay's shoulder and had to be substituted after 31 minutes for Andre Schurrle.

As for Argentina, Angel Di Maria was absent after struggling with a thigh injury.

The Real Madrid star missed the semi-final win over Holland, and was a blow for Alejandro Sabella ahead of the World Cup showdown.

Sabella had Messi to lead the way with Gonzalo Higuain, who missed a golden chance to give Argentina the lead on the 20-minute mark.

Sergio Aguero started on the bench, having struggled with a thigh injury of his own, but came on for the second half.

In the space of just a couple of 
hours, German midfielder Christoph Kramer has endured the full range of 
emotions, enjoying a stroke of huge personal fortune, as Sami Khedira's 
niggle in the warm-up to the World Cup final against Argentina handed 
him a first competitive start on the grandest stage.

Then, however, he suffered a cruel twist of fate, as a nasty head collision saw him exit the match after just half-an-hour.

Here, Sportsmail provides all you need to know about the unfortunate Kramer....

So
 tell me a little bit about Christoph Kramer, the poor German who headed
 off the pitch just half-an-hour into the World Cup Final...

The
 German central midfielder is 23 years old and enjoyed a breakthrough 
season in the Bundesliga on loan at Borussia Monchengladbach, as his 
side finished sixth in the top flight.

He
 emerged through the youth team at Bayer Leverkusen, where he will 
return to next season, and is recognised as one of the standout talents 
in Germany after a previous impressive loan spell in the second division
 with Bochum.

What kind of player is he?

An
 indefatigable midfielder, who works relentlessly in the central 
positions for his team. He does much of the unseen work and he is not 
dissimilar in style to Sami Khedira, who he replaced after the warm up 
in the World Cup final.

So has he been a fixture in the Germany national squad?

No, Kramer wasn't even picked in Joachim Low's first provisional squad for the World Cup at the beginning of May.

However,
 the coach soon decided that he required extra midfield bodies as 
players such as Sami Khedira and Bastian Schweinsteiger recovered from 
injury, while Ilkay Gundogan had already been ruled out.

Kramer
 replaced forward Andre Hahn in the squad and then impressed in training
 to such an extent that he was included in the 23-man pool for Brazil.

Has he been called into action at the World Cup?

He
 has barely featured, appearing only as a substitute in the 89th minute 
against both Algeria and France. The World Cup final on Sunday evening 
marked his first competitive start for Die Mannschaft.

That seems like a brutal induction...?

Well,
 it wasn't planned that way. Khedira pulled up in the warm up and Low 
handed Kramer the nod. Sadly, though, it was destined to be a 
short-lived experience.

How was he injured?

Argentine
 defender Ezequiel Garay crashed into Kramer as the two challenged a 
bouncing ball on the edge of the penalty area. It was a really heavy 
collision and Kramer looked visibly disorientated and was then replaced 
after just 30 minutes. At 23, we're sure that he will be back for more 
in future major tournaments.
