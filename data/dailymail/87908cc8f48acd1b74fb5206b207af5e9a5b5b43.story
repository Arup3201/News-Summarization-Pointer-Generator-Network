The mother who allowed her son Baby P to be tortured to death is 'desperate' for a new man now she is out of prison, it has been alleged.

Tracey Connelly, 32, is said to have disgusted women at her bail hostel, where she has a new identity, with her conversations about men and sex.

Connelly was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after she admitted doing nothing while her little boy was tortured to death by her boyfriend Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen.

Free: Tracey Connelly seen taking a stroll in the park weeks after being released on parole

According to The Sun, Connelly now regularly speaks about sex and men at her bail hostel after being released on parole at the end of October.

A source told the paper: 'After being locked up for so long she is desperate for a man.

'And by the way she talks, any man will do.'

She has also recently been photographed taking a stroll in a park weeks after her release from prison.

Wearing
a brown cardigan, blue trousers, trainers and a colourful scarf, she 
was seen walking with her arms folded talking to two companions.

She was spotted as she adjusts to life outside prison after being released on parole from jail.

The pictures emerged less than two weeks after she was seen strolling with a friend to the supermarket.

Tragic: Baby Peter was just 17 months old when he was found dead in his blood-spattered cot

Carrying a 'bag for life', Connelly 
was spotted walking into an Aldi store to pick up some food before 
grabbing a bargain in Poundland.

An onlooker described how she was also seen looking at posters advertising a Christmas food offer.

Baby Peter was just 17 months 
old when he was found dead in his blood-spattered cot at his mother’s 
flat in Tottenham, north London, after suffering 50 separate injuries, 
including a broken back.

The case provoked a national scandal after it emerged that social workers, police and doctors missed a series of warning signs that could have saved the child’s life.

As she was granted parole, Connelly had begged for an anonymity order and round-the-clock police protection, but ministers refused.

These orders are rare and only four are currently in force.

These apply to child killer Mary Bell, James Bulger’s murderers Robert Thompson and Jon Venables and to Maxine Carr, who provided a false alibi for Soham murderer Ian Huntley.

Indefinite sentences: Tracey Connelly's boyfriend Steven Barker (left) and his paedophile brother Jason Owen (right) were both convicted of causing or allowing Peter's death

Instead Connelly has been given a new name and released far from her old home where Peter was killed.

It was alleged that she may have been helped out of her jail in convoy of vehicles carrying 'dummy' obese women.

Sources said that extra vehicles containing women of a similar weight with their faces covered could have been used to throw anyone keen to follow her off the scent.
