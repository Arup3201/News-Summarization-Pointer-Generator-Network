Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from a weekend of international fixtures and reflects on a selection of interesting rumours from the Football League.

1. Ashley Williams was on Arsenal’s radar for ages before signing a new four-year deal at Swansea last summer, but a move to the Emirates fell through supposedly because he wasn’t considered Champions League quality. 

The 30-year-old has made a nonsense of that verdict since with his performances for Wales. Brilliant in a defiant defensive display when they gained a 0-0 draw away to Group B favourites Belgium in November, the Welsh captain was again outstanding in the 3-0 win in Israel which put Chris Coleman’s side top of the group. 

While Gareth Bale grabbed the headlines, Williams was superb at the back. He gave the ball away only twice in 90 minutes – and won it back both times.

2. John Terry is clearly a far more decent bloke than the various unsavoury episodes of his past would suggest. At the age of 34 and with a back that needs constant treatment, Chelsea’s captain could have done with a weekend off after playing all but four of Chelsea’s 45 games so far this season. 

But he gave up his time to play 45 minutes of Steven Gerrard’s All Star charity game supporting various good causes in the Merseyside area. Terry was also first to agree to play when Stiliyan Petrov ran out a sell-out game in Glasgow 18 months ago to raise funds for Leukaemia research.

3. Nathaniel Clyne might have to rein in some of the attacking instincts that have worked so well for him at Southampton when he’s wearing an England shirt. The 23-year-old is beginning to look like a natural at right back for Roy Hodgson after winning his third cap in the 4-0 win over Lithuania. 

But Hodgson clearly asked Clyne to keep his position to let opposite full back Leighton Baines do most of the marauding forward. The Everton man played 53 passes in the forward half, nearly twice the number (28) that Clyne did.

4. Portugal might have gone top of Group I with their 2-1 victory over Serbia but new boss Fernando Santos could do with finding some fresh talent for his squad. 

Seven of the side that started the game, including Cristiano Ronaldo, were already in their country’s senior squad for Euro 2008.

5. There must be something about the north London air because if Harry Kane can’t stop scoring goals, the same is true of Olivier Giroud. Arsenal’s centre forward, who has 11 goals from 13 starts for his club since the start of 2015, was on the scoresheet again for France as they beat Denmark 2-0 in a Sunday night friendly. 

Kane, certain to get his first full England start in Italy after his dramatic 79-second debut goal against Lithuania, has 14 from 14 starts for Spurs since New Year’s Day.

6. Andrew Robertson’s return from injury could be a key in helping Hull battle away from the relegation zone in the last two months of the season. 

The 21-year-old left back, picked up from Dundee United last summer by Steve Bruce for a bargain £2.8million, showed he is back to full match fitness with a dazzling display for Scotland. He played 100 passes in all during the win over Gibraltar, with 93 of them reaching a team-mate – and 49 of them in the attacking half of the field.

7. Notts County say they are going to name a new manager this week with 50-year-old Dutchman Ricardo Moniz, once on Tottenham’s coaching staff, the current bookies’ favourite to get the job. 

They might be better off forgetting that and sticking with the experienced figure of Paul Hart who stepped up from working with the Academy for a one-off day as caretaker boss against relegation rivals Scunthorpe. The 61-year-old made a dramatic difference, lifting County out of the relegation zone with a 2-2 draw – and only a late Niall Canavan goal stopped him taking all three points.

8. Midfielder Daniel Johnson was the big star when Aston Villa’s youngsters reached the quarter-finals of the NextGen series in 2012, but despite sitting on the bench as an unused sub for a few times could never find a way to the first team when Paul Lambert was in charge. 

He finally gave up trying to earn a Premier League chance in January and signed for Preston. After scoring in Sunday's 1-1 draw at Fleetwood, he now has six goals in 12 games – and must wonder how he’d have fared if he’d hung on for the Tim Sherwood regime.

9. Mark Yates was sacked by Cheltenham in November as punishment for failing to match his achievements of previous seasons when he twice took the tiny club to the League Two play-offs. 

That worked well. Replacement Paul Buckle has since come and gone too, and the club are now bottom of the table following a 3-0 home defeat by Plymouth. Caretaker Russell Milton is in charge until the summer – but has so far overseen just one win in eight matches.

10. Signing a goalscorer is the key to success at any level as Grimsby have proven by shaking up the race for promotion from the Vanarama Conference. Paul Hurst’s team looked nowhere near the race until they brought in 6ft 5ins centre forward Ollie Palmer on a loan deal from Mansfield – and haven’t looked back. 

The 23-year-old got his sixth from nine games in a 2-0 win at Welling that lifted them above Bristol Rovers on goal difference and just a point behind leaders Barnet.
