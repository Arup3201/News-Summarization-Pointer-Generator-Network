A menagerie of images have been released as part of this year's Feral Photos competition, capturing animals out in their wild habitat.

The award-winning photographs, selected from 440 entries across Australia, feature the movements and behaviours of pest animals.

The competition, run by the Invasive Animals Cooperative Research Centre, is in its fourth year running.

First place was awarded to Daniel Briggs, of Victoria, who had taken his photo of wild dogs in a den during his time at Western Australia's Northern Goldfields.

'I heard whimpering and investigated, I found a den and stretched my head and arm [with his phone] into the tunnel and came out with a couple of shots,' he said.

'Probably could have got a better shot but didn't fancy leaving my butt exposed to mum [of the pups] for any longer.'

Second place was Trent Scholz, who shot the striking image of the Camel train in the Simpson Desert in South Australia. 

The photograph is of a flying cane toad was taken by John Jones, who came third in the competition, during his time spent in Queensland.

This award-winnning image from this year's Feral Photos competition was The People's Choice. It was taken by Kate Crossing of Nolia Napangarti Ward and a feral cat in Alice Springs in Western Australia

Ian Robb was awarded the Best Remote Camera for his photo of the wedge tail eagle and fox.

He said he shot the image from his property using a motion detecting camera. 

The People's Choice went to Kate Crossing and her photo of Nolia Napangarti Ward and a feral cat in Alice Springs in Western Australia.

'Nolia Napangarti Ward holding a feral cat which she had just successfully hunted,' she said.

'People from Kiwirrkurra community in the remote western desert have a long tradition of hunting cats for food. This one had several small lizards in its stomach.'

There were three photos were highly commended in the competition.

They include Neil Walker's photo of a feral cat reflection in a dam in outback NSW, taken early in the morning.

Another is Marika Maxwell's feral cat with a brush‐tailed phascogale. It was captured in south-west of Western Australia.
