Curiosity almost killed this cat, as it found its way into a home moving box and got taped in with no food or water for more than a month.

Ashley Barth's kitty Mee Moowe disappeared in September as movers packed her family's belongings for a 4,800-plus mile move from Suffolk, Virginia, to Hawaii.

She and her daughters delayed their move for three nights as they frantically looked for their pet but in the end they had to give up the search and wave their former home goodbye.

However, thirty-six days later, when the removal boxes arrived in Hawaii the Barths got an unexpected surprise.

Ashley told  WAVY-TV she heard a faint 'meow' as her possessions were unloaded and  Mee Moowe was discovered hiding in one of the boxes.

'The [removal] guy goes, "what was that sound?" and my heart just kind of sunk for a minute and I thought, "no, no way." And then we heard it again. And the guy said, "was that a cat?"' Ashley recalled.

The feline had reportedly lost half her body weight and could barely walk.

Her eyes were also 'crusted shut'. 

'I was in shock,' Ashley said. 

'I couldn't believe it. I think I was grateful that she was alive, but I was furious this happened to her.'

A vet in Hawaii  reported  Mee Moowe exhibited classic symptoms of starvation.

Though the Barths were thrilled to have their pet back the reunion was short-lived.

After being fed and watered back to health, Mee Moowe was sent to quarantine as she did not undergo the vaccination process needed to make the move overseas.

The Barths are currently waiting for her return, so she finally settle into her new home. 

'I couldn't believe it. I think I was grateful that she was alive, but I was furious this happened,' Barth said
