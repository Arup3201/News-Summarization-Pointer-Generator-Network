Rangers boss Harry Redknapp was pleased with his team's performance despite them still looking for a first point on the road this season.

Goals from Ross Barkley, Kevin Mirallas and Steven Naismith consigned Redknapp's side to yet another away defeat in the Premier League. 

QPR are the only team in England to register an away point this campaign Redknapp felt if his side were to reverse that trend, this game against the Toffees was an ample opportunity.

'I felt the Everton crowd were very edgy tonight,' he said. 'If ever there was a chance to come here and get a result, it was tonight.

'I wasn't disappointed how we played. I thought we played okay tonight.' 

He added: "I thought tonight we got on the front foot, we pressed them well, we worked hard and I felt that we deserved more than what we we got from the game, we really did."

'For 35 minutes or whatever we were comfortable.' 

Bobby Zamora entered the fray in the 58th minute and registered a late consolation for his side in the 80th minute, but it was too little, too late for Redknapp's side. 

'You can put two up top,' Redknapp explained. 

'You go two down and you can chuck Bobby up top but then the third went in I felt tonight we pressed well. We deserved more than we got tonight.'
