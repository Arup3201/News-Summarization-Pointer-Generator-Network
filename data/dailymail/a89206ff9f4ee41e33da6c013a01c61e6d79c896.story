British spies will have to report to MPs about payments from the US government and what was expected in return.

Sir Malcolm Rifkind, chairman of the parliamentary spy watchdog, said GCHQ would have to explain allegations that it received £100million over three years from Washington.

But he ‘wasn’t remotely surprised’ the eavesdropping agency, based in Cheltenham, had ‘co-operated’ with the US National Security Agency on projects.

According to fugitive whistleblower Edward Snowden, in return for the secret payments the British agency was expected to ‘pull its weight’ and at one point the Americans said GCHQ’s work was not ‘meeting minimum expectations’.

The Intelligence and Security Committee, headed by Sir Malcolm, has been investigating revelations from the former NSA contractor about the UK’s involvement in Washington’s Prism intelligence project, which harvests data from Facebook, emails and phone calls.

Snowden said British spies had requested intercepts from Prism to bypass UK laws. GCHQ has been cleared of flouting the law.

Sir Malcolm said he had not yet been able to check the details of the alleged £96million payments from 2009 to 2012, adding: ‘We will get a report from GCHQ on these allegations

Secretive: GCHQ Headquarters where it is believed their services were 'used' by the U.S.

‘I’m not remotely surprised that for a number of years GCHQ and the NSA have had a number of joint projects in which they co-operate together with substantial resources to do their joint projects. That’s something we have investigated, taking evidence from both GCHQ in London and the NSA.’

Sir Malcolm added that ‘in general, Snowden’s behaviour has been hugely irresponsible’.Labour MP Paul Flynn said: ‘I don’t think anyone had any inkling of these payments. Clearly we fool ourselves that we have an independent foreign policy.’

He said the claims showed Britain was ‘the poodle of the US’.
