A luxury six-bedroom country home is up for sale at just £75,000 with a hidden catch - it could be flattened by rocks at any time.

The spacious family home sits on the banks of one of Britain's best salmon rivers with panoramic views across miles of rolling countryside in the Wye Valley.

It would normally be on sale for around £500,000 but the estate agent handling the sale has admitted: 'There's just one snag.'

Luxury property: The unfinished three-storey six-bedroom home is expected to sell for just £75,000 - but it could be hit by falling rocks at any time

Rock danger: Already three boulders have crashed into the back of the home in the last 12 months

The house, named Lakeside, could be hit by falling boulders from a former tinworks at any time - causing serious damage to the property.

Already three two tonne boulders have crashed into the home in the past year causing some minor damage to the walls.

The tinworks was closed in the 18th century and a modern housing development was built on it around 15 years ago.

But the property, in the village of 
Redbrook, Gloucestershire, is superbly placed on the banks of the River Wye close to the 
Welsh border. It attracts fishermen from all over Europe for its wild 
salmon.

It boasts four reception rooms, two kitchens and two bathrooms but has not yet been fully fitted out.

The Offa's Dyke Path and the Wye Valley Walk run through the village which has a post office and two pubs.

Spice Girl Mel C lives in a neighbouring village and Harry Potter author J K Rowling was brought up nearby.

Spectacular: The home is enviably located in the Wye Valley and could sell for £500,000 if there was no risk of falling rocks

Danger: A huge boulder which has come down the hillside property is seen no more than a few feet from the unfinished property which was built more than five years ago

Paul Fosh, managing director of his own auctioneer firm, said if a buyer is able to pin the rocks back they could potentially have a bargain property.

However, at present the home cannot get building insurance - and no banks would be willing to provide a mortgage for it.

It is due to go under the hammer at auction tonight, and the buyer may decide to knock the property down and start again.

Mr Fosh said: 'Three boulders have hit the house in the last 12 months and have caused superficial damage. If someone was standing there at the time they could have been killed.

'It is being marketed as a potential building plot - it is a house that needs to be demolished. People have said they can get round the problem through engineering with pinning and netting.

'They have suggested putting big long girders into the rock face ever metre or so and then installing chicken mesh to secure the whole property.

'The house is built very close to the rock face which makes this difficult to do.

'People are looking at this and thinking they could spend £50,000 fixing the problem and then sell the property on for £400,000 or £500,000.'

Two giant rocks which have rolled down the bank could be seen less than 10ft from the back of the house today.

Rock risk: A buyer could install wire netting behind the property to stop the property being damaged. However, it was built so close to the cliff face such a task would be very difficult

When the land was sold to the builder, there was a covenant stipulating exactly what sort of house could be built to avoid the property being hit by boulders.

However, the owners ignored the covenant and went ahead with their own flawed project.

The interior of the three-storey property is unfinished because the developers stopped work when they discovered the problem more than five years ago.

The advertisement says: 'It requires completion works both internally and externally but has double glazing and gas fired central heating.'

A retired businessman who lives in the village said: 'It's a lovely modern house and it's going for a song.

'But would you sleep at night knowing a huge lump of rock could land in your bed at any time.'
