Perhaps it was the title that should have been the giveaway for TV presenter Andrea McLean.

For when she was offered a leading role in a British gangster flick, it was called A Landscape Of Lies.

The Loose Women star was filmed in intimate clinches as she played a bisexual therapist in what its makers claimed was a movie portraying a ‘seedy world of power, lies, and betrayal’.

But Miss McLean, 43, soon discovered 
it was the film producers who were dealing in lies and betrayal. For the
 four men and a woman behind the project were involved in a 
sophisticated scam to cheat the taxman.

They had begun by pretending to be 
making a blockbuster with the similar title, A Landscape Of Lives. They 
claimed this film would star Hollywood A-listers such as Jeremy Irons, 
as well as his wife Sinead Cusack and Hollyoaks star Christina Bailey, 
and had a £20million budget

But it was all a sham to allow the 
gang to make out the venture had lost most of the money they had 
‘invested’, so they could claim £2.7million in tax rebates under a 
scheme designed to boost the film industry.

Yesterday a judge said the scam exposed the ‘naievety’ of such rebate schemes.

The gang wrote fake scripts and crafted counterfeit documents to give their plan a veneer of respectability.

They raked in almost £1million in fraudulently claimed cash in the 12 months until April 2011.

But tax officials became suspicious – 
and discovered the film company’s offices in fashionable Harley Street, 
London, consisted of a single empty room.

Its ‘studio’ was the flat of one of the gang, where they had managed to produce just eight minutes of poor quality footage.

But while on bail after they were 
arrested on suspicion of fraud, the gang hatched a plot to convince 
investigators the project did exist, and made A Landscape Of Lies – with
 a budget of less than £90,000. Miss McLean was unwittingly roped in to 
play Dr Audrey Grey.

Marc Bannerman, who played Gianni di Marco in EastEnders, was also approached.

The gang even created a website which 
boasted: ‘This gritty British drama is a complex exploration of lives 
that will draw you into their seedy world of power, lies, and betrayal.

‘The dark themes are subtly 
illuminated by the characters’ poignant stories. The storyline 
challenges people’s notions of what’s right and what’s wrong.’

Film tax scam: The five fraudsters convinced HMRC that Madden's production company Evolved Pictures had secured £19.6million in financial backing from a Jordanian company for gangster film A Landscape of Lies

Charged: Pakistani national Tariq Hassan was convicted of one charge of conspiracy to cheat the revenue in relation to film tax credits and jailed for four years

Ironically, A Landscape Of Lies won an
 award at the 2012 Las Vegas Film Festival. But by then the scam had 
collapsed completely after tax officials began exmaining the books.

Yesterday, the five fraudsters were 
jailed at Southwark crown court, with Judge Juliet May saying she could 
not decide whether they were ‘fantasists’ or were laughing at the 
‘naivety’ of a system designed to encourage home-grown filmmakers.

The mastermind of the scam was 
bankrupt former property developer Bassar Al-Issa, 33, who was jailed 
for six and a half years. An Iraqi national living in Maida Vale, West 
London, he dreamt up the scheme while studying finance at the University
 of East London. He transferred a substantial chunk of the illicit 
profits to Jordan, where he has a home and businesses. It has not been 
recovered.

Aoife Madden, 31, an actress, film producer and former drama teacher, was jailed for four years and eight months.

Her home was used to shoot the few 
scenes of the original movie that were filmed and she hand-delivered a 
DVD to officials to try to prove it existed.

She was also a student at the 
University of East London, where another conspirator, Tariq Hassan, 51, 
taught Al-Issa. Hassan, of Loughton, Essex was jailed for four years.

Architect Ian Sherwood, 53, from 
Manchester, was jailed for three and a half years, while Jordanian 
businessman Osama Al-Baghdady, 50, from Manchester, was jailed for four 
years.

The four men had denied fraud, saying 
the claims for VAT repayment and Film Tax Credit were made in good 
faith. They were convicted earlier this month.

Madden, of West Kensington, West London, admitted conspiracy to cheat the public revenue.

Miss McLean declined to comment after the case yesterday.
