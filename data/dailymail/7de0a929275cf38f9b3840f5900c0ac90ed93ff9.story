Lewis Hamilton's public feud with Nico Rosberg appeared to be forgotten about ahead of last Sunday's Canadian Grand Prix.

The Mercedes team-mates have not always seen eye-to-eye over the course of the Formula One season so far, but the pair looked to be in better spirits as Hamilton photobombed Rosberg.

Pals? Hamilton (left) & Rosberg (right) fell out during the Monaco Grand Prix but have since cooled their feud

In a light-hearted gesture the British racer gatecrashed Rosberg's photograph with two fans in Montreal.

The picture amused the Mercedes team, who posted it to their Twitter account with the caption: 'Best... #photobomb... EVER!!! @LewisHamilton @nico_rosberg #F1 #TheMontREALdeal.'

In the previous Grand Prix at Monaco, Hamilton said him and Rosberg were not friends but merely colleagues following his second place to the German.

A fortnight ago, Hamilton was visibly angry that Rosberg ruined his final qualifying lap at Monaco by stopping just off the track.

The German had braked too late â€” he said accidentally; Hamilton implied it was intentional.

The duo had previously both insisted their friendship, which goes back to their childhood as team-mates in karting, would survive the fierce test of a championship battle.

Indicators that their differences had healed were evident during the race weekend in North America with the pair cooling their dispute before Rosberg took second place, while a brake failure forced Hamilton to retire midway through the race.
