The mother of a 16-year-old girl shot dead after her friends allegedly got out their car to smoke marijuana on 'the wrong side of town' has issued an emotional appeal for details.

Paige Stalker, top of her class at Detroit's University Liggett School, was in a car with her best friend and three strangers on December 22 on her way home to watch a movie when the group pulled over to smoke.

They were accosted by an armed man who told them they were in the 'wrong part of town' then opened fire as they tried to drive away - killing Paige instantly and leaving a 15-year-old boy in critical condition.

Today, Paige's mother Jennifer Stalker  implored witnesses of the attack on the east side of Detroit to contact police.

Questions: The family of Paige Stalker, 16, are calling for witnesses of her fatal shooting to come forward

Devastated: Her mother Jennifer said she has no idea why Paige was in a car with strangers

She told reporters the 16-year-old was on her way home to see a movie with her younger brother and older sister, and the family has no idea why she was with strangers.

'My whole family is devastated and this is going to change our lives forever, not only our lives, but the lives of people in our community,' Mrs Stalker told CBS.

'My three other children, we talk a lot about Paige and what kind of person she was and just our trips that we've taken together. 

'There aren't enough words to say what a wonderful child Paige was, in every way, she was an angel here on earth.'

Her plea came moments after the family visited the scene of the crime for the first time.

'You expect this vision in your head of, like, hell,' said Mrs Stalker told a press conference. 'But it really wasn't. It was OK.'

'We just had such an outpouring of love, everyone just stopping by and talking about it, it was wonderful,' she added, 'that was really nice.'

Rewards for information leading to an arrest have grown to $112,000. 

According to family sources, the man shouted at the teens, who instructed their female driver to speed off. The man shot when the group attempted to flee.

Heading home: Paige had been heading home to watch a movie with her siblings, relatives said

Paige died though the group sped to a nearby hospital, Local 4 reported.

Passenger Demetrius Herndon and the female driver, both 16, have been discharged from hospital and a 17-year-old female passenger was unharmed.

'We re-interviewed the victims and got a little bit more information, accurate information,' Adam Madera, a Detroit police spokesman, told Local 4. 'We now are working under the assumption that it possibly was an attempted robbery gone wrong.' 

Herndon told Local 4 of the shooting 'We hurried up and turned on the car and we did a U-turn, rode up some grass and hit a tree. Then, he shot the side of the car. 

'He shot the girl in the head, shot Donald in the arm and shot me in my arm.'

Remembered: Paige Stalker attended University Liggett School, was on the honor roll and played lacrosse

Earlier, Detroit Police Chief James Craig told Local 4 'We do not believe this was a random attack. We're still working very hard to find out what took place. 

'Candidly, there has been some challenges for us in terms of the accounts of what's taken place. So, we're asking for full cooperation.'

Madera told The Detroit Free Press that between 25 and 30 shell casings were recovered from where the shooting took place.

The teenagers earlier claimed to search for a passenger's brother and claimed to be going to a movie theater, police told the newspaper. 

Stalker attended University Liggett School, was on the honor roll and played lacrosse, The Detroit Free Press reported.

Stalker's classmate Alexander Minanov told the newspaper 'It's just really sad that instead of planning for Christmas, the family has to plan for a funeral.'
