They used to say that when America sneezed, the world caught a cold, but this year, in the world of beauty at least, we’re all going to be catching the Korean bug. Because the newest, most exciting products all have a distinctly Eastern flavour.

The Korean craze all began with BB creams — technically short for Blemish Balms, but essentially rebranded tinted moisturisers.

‘BB creams were big in Korea because the girls liked the cuteness of saying “BB cream”,’ explains Kathy Phillips, international beauty director for publisher Conde Nast’s Asian division. ‘There was nothing special about them, it was just another way of selling an existing product.’

The Korean cosmetic craze began with BB creams (Blemish Balms), which quickly became popular in Britain thanks to online promotions (pictured posed by model)

But thanks to the internet, the trend quickly spread, and as soon as British brands saw an appetite for BB creams, they started bringing out their own.

They also started to keep a close eye on what was happening in Korea. Because while BB creams were not much more than clever marketing, some genuine innovation is emerging.

‘There’s a big pharmaceutical industry there which the government has ploughed money into,’ says Kathy. ‘Cosmetic developments have come alongside it.’

So, among this year’s slew of Korean-influenced new products, which ones are worth looking out for?

LANCOME MIRACLE CUSHION

Lancom Cushion Miracle Foundation 

£29.50, nationwide

These cushion cosmetics are a huge hit in Korea, and Lancome is the first Western brand to launch a version. Essentially a sponge saturated with a light foundation, it comes inside a compact with a mirror and pad-style applicator.

VERDICT: A brilliantly easy way to carry a liquid foundation around with you. It comes in six shades with refills costing £19.50.

MAI COUTURE BLUSH PAPIER

Mai Couture Blush Papier

£12.50 for 50 sheets, thisisbeautymart.com

These papers, infused with a powder blush, come in three shades, from a golden apricot to sun-kissed bronze. Just pat the paper against your face — one sheet does both cheeks.

VERDICT: If you’ve ever found your blusher in pieces after carting it around in your handbag, you’ll appreciate these. They make it incredibly simple to top up your blusher on the go.

MASQUEBAR ANTI-WRINKLE SHEET MASKS

MasqueBar Anti-Wrinkle Sheet Masks

£9.99 for three, Boots

Masks are a huge Korean trend — from gel and fabric ones that make you look like Hannibal Lecter to conventional mud and cream varieties. These have give skin a serious dose of hydration.

VERDICT: They really do boost hydration, temporarily erasing fine lines.

ERBORIAN HERBAL ENERGY LOTION 30%

Erborian Herbal Energy Lotion 30%

£22.50, Selfridges

A collaboration between a Korean scientist and a French beauty obsessive, Erborian has been a beauty insider secret in the UK for a while. This lotion, based on Asian herbs, is designed to be used either as a toner, or with the cotton mask provided to create a mask.

VERDICT: Delicately scented but not overpowering, if you’re looking for a new toner, this leaves skin soft, and hydrated. Ideal for those who don’t like the dewy finish. It also comes in six shades.

SKINPEP AUTO MAKEUP

£29.99, skinpep.com

Hi-tech beauty gadgets are big news in Asia, so it’s no surprise that this South Korean brand offers a vibrating puff that promises a flawless finish for foundation.

VERDICT: If you’re prone to ending up blotchy through applying foundation unevenly, this is a bit of a godsend.

The puff is anti-microbial and vibrates around 12,000 times a minute to really work foundation into the skin, giving a dewy, natural and even result that a regular sponge or brush simply can’t compete with.

THIS WORKS NO WRINKLES WONDER ESSENCE

This Works No Wrinkles-Wonder Essence

£30, thisworks.com

This is inspired by Korean ‘essences’ — water-based formulas that combine the properties of a toner, serum and moisturiser. Just pat a couple of drops on your face after cleansing.

VERDICT: Many toners are alcohol-heavy and leave skin dry. This feels much gentler. It also contains hyaluronic acid, which attracts moisture to the skin.

MIZON EGG WHITE BUBBLE CLEANSER

Mizon Egg White Bubble Cleanser

£19, cultbeauty.co.uk

This quirky brand offers a range of off-beat products boasting ingredients as curious as starfish extract and snail secretion. In that context, the eggshell membrane extract in this foaming cleanser seems pretty pedestrian.

VERDICT: Weird ingredients aside, this has a clean, soapy scent. It removes grime without leaving skin tight or dry.

FRINGE STABILISER

From around £1, ebay.co.uk

These simple but quirky hair accessories — basically the hook side of velcro, cut into heart or bow shapes — are used to hold hair off your face when washing or applying make up. You can also find them on Amazon.

VERDICT: They might look like they’re designed for teenagers, but they’re quicker and easier than using a hairband or clip, and much less likely to mess up a blow dry.
