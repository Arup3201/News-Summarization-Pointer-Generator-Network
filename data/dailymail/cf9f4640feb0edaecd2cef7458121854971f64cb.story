A soldier who had gone absent without leave has been charged with the murder of a 19-year-old woman who was stabbed after returning from a late-night walk.

Scarlett Paxton was found dead with a stab wound to the neck outside her apartment in Juanita, Washington state after returning from a late-night walk with her boyfriend, Michael Lawson, with whom she lived.

The vivacious brunette and her boyfriend had gone on a walk around their neighbourhood on November 30 before she became upset and decided to return to the property on her own.

Lawson later found her body slumped against her apartment door with a deep stab wound to her neck and cuts on her hands, legs and chin.

Police have since charged Private 1st Class Dakota Wolf, also 19, with first degree murder after bloody fingerprints matching his were found at a trash bin near the scene of the killing.

In the weeks since her death Lawson has posted about his struggles on Facebook.

On December 23 the heartbroken 19-year-old wrote, 'I miss Scarlett so bad that it's making me feel physically ill. It feels like I'm dying of loneliness or something.'

Lawson wrote that the loss of Scarlett (pictured left with her sister Holly) has filled him with rage at Dakota and like he himself is dying of heartbreak

Weeks earlier, when Dakota was named a suspect, Lawson expressed his rage on the social networking site.

'I have never been so very filled with anger and hatred towards another human being in my life. It feels like my chest is going to explode,' he posted.

'I hope that Dakota Wolf is forced to feel the same pain, fear and loneliness that Scarlett was for the rest of his existence on this planet and beyond.'

Earlier this week he wrote, 'Hey everyone, Merry Christmas. And to all who have been so supportive through this ordeal and the loss of Scarlett, Thank you so much. You have done more for me than you know.

Paxton's mother has said she became upset and returned home alone after believing Lawson had suggested the walk to lose weight

Detectives are now investigating 
whether the soldier, who had gone absent without leave from Joint Base 
Lewis-McChord, knew the female victim.

Authorities have said there is evidence that Paxton and Wolf had visited the same teen center in Kirkland, Washington state.

Lt. Mike Murray of the Kirkland Police Department said: 'We have not been able to put a link to them as far as knowing each other in any way at this point.'

'Right now the best we can determine is it's still just a random assault.'

Wolf has denied any involvement in Paxton's death, but admitted being in the same general area as her.

Paxton's mother, Michelle Diggins, said her daughter had gone out for a late-night walk with her Lawson, also 19, shortly after 1:30 a.m. on Nov 30.

But she became upset and returned home alone after believing Lawson had suggested the stroll because she needed to lose weight.

Mrs Diggins said: 'She wasn't heavy. And that's not the way he meant it at all; he really loves her. But... like most young women, Scarlett could be self-conscious.'

Lawson later discovered his girlfriend's body and dialled 911, but emergency services were unable to save her.

Murder suspect Wolf told detectives he had been smoking synthetic cannabis that night, and had for some time been suffering from 'paranoia, hallucinations, anxiety and memory issues,' along with problems with anger management, according to prosecution documents.

Army Major Christopher Ophardt, a spokesman at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, said Wolf had been scheduled to go on a training mission to Ft. Irwin, California, but failed to report, before going absent without leave 'for good' on Nov 15.
