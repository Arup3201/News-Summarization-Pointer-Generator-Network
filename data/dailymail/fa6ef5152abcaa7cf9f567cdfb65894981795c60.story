Pulled out: US military personnel in a car leaves the Afghan Interior Ministry in Kabul after two senior officers were shot inside

Another seven American military advisers have been injured in Afghanistan as US casualties from protests at troops burning the Koran mount.

The Americans were injured in the city of Kunduz when protesters threw a grenade at their base.

It comes on the sixth day of violent protest in Afghanistan amid anger at American troops who threw a Koran onto a rubbish fire at Bagram air base last week.

Two senior US officers, a lieutenant colonel and a major, were yesterday shot in the back of the head by an Afghan policeman as they worked at the interior ministry.

That led to the pull out of all NATO staff from Afghan government buildings and Kabul is today on lockdown as authorities search for  Abul Saboor, a 25-year-old policeman suspected of being behind the attacks.

He is thought to have shot the officers in the ministry's command and control centre, which would have been crawling with Afghan police.

It comes as bitter protests - including the burning of effigies of President Obama - over the controversial actions enter their sixth day.

NATO earlier issued a statement confirming the two deaths.

It said: 'Initial reports indicate an 
individual turned his weapon against International Security Assistance 
Force (ISAF) service members in Kabul City today [Saturday], killing two
 servicemembers.'

NATO spokesman Lt. 
Col Jimmie Cummings said 'initial reports say it was not a Western 
shooter.' He declined to provide further information.

NATO forces have advisers embedded in many Afghan ministries, both as trainers and to help manage the transition to Afghan control and foreign forces prepare to withdraw by the end of 2014.

The Afghan Interior Ministry oversees all of the country's police, so has numerous NATO advisers.

Two Afghan officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the ministry shooting did not involve any Afghans.

The Taliban, who have claimed responsibility for the attack, said 'a hero mujahid Abdul Rahman' killed four advisers over
 the burning of Korans at a US-run military base.

In a statement, Taliban spokesman 
Zabiullah Mujahid said the gunman was an insurgent named Abdul Rahman. 
He said an accomplice inside the ministry helped him get inside the 
compound. He said the killings were a planned response to the Quran 
burnings.

'After
 the attack, Rahman informed us by telephone that he was able to kill 
four high-ranking American advisers,' Mujahid said. The Taliban 
frequently exaggerate casualty claims.

Inevitably the latest shooting has 
raised questions over security at what should be one of the most secure 
compounds in the city. 

With the dangerous gunman still at 
large, a massive manhunt is underway and all NATO personnel have been 
recalled from Afghan ministries.

General John Allen said the recall of advisers is
 'for obvious force protection reasons' but the alliance remains 
committed to its partnership with the Afghan government.

He said NATO is investigating Saturday's shooting and will pursue all leads to find the person responsible for the attack.

'The perpetrator of this attack is a coward whose actions will not go unanswered,' Allen said

The fatal shooting comes soon after three protesters were shot dead by Afghan security forces.

The situation was already fragile as 
NATO forces attempt to bring stability to the region before foreign 
troops withdraw by the end of 2014.

But the unstable country has 
smouldered this week as thousands of Afghans took to the streets to 
protest the burning of Korans by U.S soldiers.

Six Afghan soldiers have also been 
killed and 16 others were wounded today while trying to defuse a 
roadside bomb in the Mukar district of the Baghdis province in western 
Afghanistan.

But it is not clear if this incident is connected to the ongoing protests now on their fifth day.

An apology from President Barack Obama has failed to quell public outrage after it emerged that Qurans and other religious materials had been thrown into an incinerator used to burn garbage at Bagram Air Field, a large U.S. base north of Kabul.

Despite a call for restraint from Afghan leader Hamid Karzai, renewed protests continued today. 12 people were killed and dozens wounded on Friday, the bloodiest day yet in demonstrations. At least 28 people have been killed and hundreds wounded since Tuesday.

Muslims consider the Koran to be the literal word of God and treat each copy with deep reverence with desecration considered one of the worst forms of blasphemy.

The Koran burnings underscore the deep cultural divide that still exists more than 10 years after U.S troops invaded to oust the Taliban and have deepened public mistrust of the West.

Violent protest have continued across three Afghan provinces.

One protester was shot dead in the Logar province, south of Kabul, after hundreds took to the streets - many chanting 'death to America' - and charged at police. Two others were wounded.  

A further three protesters were shot dead by Afghan security forces in the quieter northern Kunduz province, as they set alight shops and buildings, according to a senior police detective Ghulam Mohn Farhad. Several people were wounded.

Meanwhile, around 1,000 protesters 
threw stones at Afghan security forces in the eastern Laghman province, 
smashing windows of government buildings and attempting to attack the 
nearby governor's house.

Laghman
 provincial police chief Abdul Rahman Sarjang said eight people were 
injured - three policemen, two intelligence officers and three 
civilians.

He said there were gunmen among the protesters, but claimed the police did not fire their weapons into the crowd or into the air, because they did not want to further incite the mob.

However, university student Mohammad Jawad, who helped transport injured protesters to the hospital, said at least 20 people were wounded after 'security forces opened fire on the crowd'.

Protests today also broke out in 
Pakistan as Muslim marched in support of the demonstrations in 
Afghanistan over the burning of the Koran.

But the Afghan capital, Kabul, remained calm with police and security forces deployed across the city.          

The ongoing protests could dent plans for a strategic pact that Washington is considering with Kabul, which would allow a sharply reduced number of Western troops to stay in the country, well beyond their combat exit deadline.
