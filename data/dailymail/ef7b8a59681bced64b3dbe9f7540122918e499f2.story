Martin Murray exhibited courage beyond the call of duty in Monte Carlo. The hard man from St Helens withstood a witching hour of agony to make history against the mightiest pound-for-pound boxer in the world.

That almost suicidal refusal to sink into purgatory was not enough for Murray to finally win his world middleweight championship at his third time of trying.

That persistence under crucifying fire – a mentality beyond the comprehension of most who never venture onto that roped scaffold – could not quite carry him to the honour of going the 12-round distance.

But it did give our reformed ex-prisoner the distinction of taking Gennady Golovkin the furthest he has ever been in his 32 fights of terrifying destructive power, to the agony of the 11th.

The Kazakh wrecking ball had not been past eight rounds in 18 fights in the past six years and only once as far as the tenth in this entire career which now contains 29 knock-outs, the highest stoppage percentage in the annals of the classic middleweight division.

For that Mr Murray was applauded from the ring within an opulent ballroom in this Disneyland for grown ups – and deserves a hero’s welcome when he arrives home in Lancashire.

It is not always about winning. Murray, having turned his life around, found even more dignity, admiration and, most importantly of all, self respect by his valour.

I could give him no better than a share of one round. He was battered to the canvas for the first time in his career. Then twice more. The last time, from a right hand blow like a bazooka, sank him into a tortured crouch and enabled referee Luis Sabon to enact a merciful, rightful stoppage.

Murray had not just come to survive. He fought back whenever he could, often enough for Golovkin has a chin which would probably withstand even his own murderous punchee.

But every time he did hit out he was brutally punished for his temerity by not only the power but also the ring mastery of one of probably the next greatest pound-for-pound boxer on the planet.

The nervous wait for Murray finally ended as he entered this bizarre venue at three minutes to midnight. Golovkin made his ring walk precisely at the witching hour. They like a late night in Casinoville. It was well into Sunday by the time the national anthems, the formalities and announcer Michael Buffer’s call to Rumble gave way to the first bell. 

Once the opening bell rang Golovkin went to work with his left jab but Murray was unabashed and landed a couple of rangy right counters. A combination from Murray stung the Kazakh into action and the first volley of his power punches sent the Englishman on to the retreat.

In round two, the brave Briton had the advantages of height, weight and reach but Golovkin’s speed was the problem and referee Luis Pabon warned Murray for holding. Murray had come to fight but was rocked by a right left combination but kept doing enough in adversity to steal a share of the round.

Golovkin showed all of his power in the third, after Murray’s one-twos were again in evidence at the start of the round. But he was rocked by lefts and rights to the head and body and did well to stave off being knocked down for the first time in his 31 fight career when Golovkin opened up in the final minute.

With the heat well and truly on, not for the first time Murray was warned for hitting low in desperation, That first visit to the canvas was not long delayed. A wicked, trademark body shot sat him down. No sooner did he rise than Golvokin unleashed a vicious combination which dropped him again. It was an act of courage for Murray to make it to the bell.

Golovkin took a comparative breather in the fifth, and Murray was able to throw some punches of his own but the Lancashire complexion was reddening badly. Murray's only hope appeared to be that the champion would punch himself out.

Murray’s courage was remarkable as the fight headed into the sixth, but he was taking a beating now. Three uppercuts in succession left him spitting blood and he sank painfully onto his stool in the corner at the end of the round.

A show of defiance from Murray gave him the satisfaction of landing a couple of combinations in the seventh, but he was being stalked and after more heavy blows from Golovkin had to cling to the Kazakh's waist to stay upright under heavy fire in the closing seconds.

Murray’s resolve was heroic. Many a good man would have had enough by the end of the fourth but here he was still trying to fire back four rounds later. At times only his strength kept him up and when he did sink to his knees the referee gave him the benefit of a slip. There was more hell to come and it looked as if only the bell prevented Mr Sabon from calling a halt to proceedings.

Under the open scoring system the announcer revealed that Golovkin was holding a huge lead at the start of the ninth. No surprise there. Just as predictably the hole for Murray deepened but he kept taking the punishment and swinging in hope.

Somehow Murray had become the second man to take Golovkin to the tenth in his career. Again he called on his phenomenal reserves of strength come out fighting. Again Golovkin punished his affrontery with an assault verging on slaughter and a massive right dropped Murray for the third time. Again the bell came to the rescue.

Murray came back out to make his little piece of 11th round history – but there was to be no survival to the final bell. Another near-decapitating right sank him to a seated position on the ropes and more blows rained Mr Pabon – mercifully and rightly – hurried to call the stoppage.
