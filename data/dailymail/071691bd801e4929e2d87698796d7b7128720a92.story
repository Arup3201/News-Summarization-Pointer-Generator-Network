A controversial sculpture recently erected in a small town is being moved today to spare the blushes of the locals.

The artwork, entitled 'Blue Human Condition' has been the talk of Adrian, Michigan since it was installed on April 21.Â 

The statue is of seven, gender-neutral figures intertwined in varying standing and seated shapes. It was covered with tarp after some residents complained about its apparent sexual innuendo.

The sculpture currently sits next to the city offices but will be moved to a more secluded spot in Yew Park where the public will still have full access to it, a city official told lenconnect.com

The piece was created by sculptor Mark Chatterley of Williamston and had been rented as part of a public art program.

Mr Chatterley told MailOnline today: 'I think it's rather funny and a shame all the brouhaha about it. I'm disappointed, it was in a great spot. But I'm glad the city still want it as part of the show.'

The sculptor, who has exhibited all over the U.S. and the world in his 30-year career, said he is a little worried about his statue being moved to a more secluded spot.

He said: 'I'm worried because it's made of clay and could be destroyed. The spot it is in right now is next to the police station.'

Mr Chatterley said that 'Blue Human Condition' represents how people cannot survive on their own and we all need help from everyone around us- but denied any sexual connotations to his work.

He said: 'It's about how we are all in one big group together and rely on each other.'
