Animal rights group PETA has released a distressing video that it says shows animals that it claims have been driven 'insane' while living in captivity.

With the release of behind-the-scenes footage of captive animals the organisation is urging the public to boycott circuses and zoos.

'Zoochosis' is defined as a psychological condition of animals kept in circuses and zoos. 

PETA has released an eye-opening video of several animals in captivity apparently suffering from 'zoochosis'

Symptoms are said to include pacing, circling, swaying, and even self-injury, caused by deprivation, loneliness, stress, desperation and insanity. 

The video shows clips of several animals in fragile psychological states, including a bear repeatedly walking in circles in a zoo, elephants swaying while housed in what looks like a barn, and a monkey engaging in self-harm. 

'Even the best artificial environments can't come close to matching the space, diversity, and freedom that animals have in their natural habitats,' a statement on PETA's website reads. 

'This deprivation - combined with relentless boredom, loneliness, stress, and sometimes even abuse, causes many captive animals to lose their minds.'

'Zoochosis' is a psychological condition caused by deprivation experienced by animals kept in confinement

PETA adds: 'Zoochosis is so rampant that some zoos even resort to administering mind-altering drugs such as Prozac to address the public's complaints about abnormal behaviours.' 

And, in circuses, the organisation asserts that the treatment of animals may be even more concerning.

It claims circuses are not subject to any sort of treatment guidelines while training the animals because 'no government agency monitors training sessions.' 

Symptoms of the condition include swaying, self-harm and walking in circles, like this bear

Moreover, circuses often adhere to extensive travel schedules and as such, the animals spend a great deal of time confined to trucks and trailers in between shows.

PETA points to examples of animals who have injured themselves - and often, others - while attempting to escape from zoo pens or circus travel cages.

According to PETA: 'The living conditions at zoos, circuses, and other animal exhibits are often dismal, with animals confined to tiny, filthy, barren enclosures that can't come anywhere close to matching the space, diversity, and freedom that animals enjoy in their natural habitat.'

'Even the best artificial environments can't come close to their natural habitats,' PETA's website reads

Countries such as Austria, Bolivia, Finland, Singapore and Sweden have recently implemented bans on wild-animal acts in circuses.

And in the UK, 94 per cent of respondents to a 2011 government consultation made clear that they wanted to see wild animal circuses banned entirely. As of now, 27 countries have bans on animal circuses and the UK could soon follow. 

'Animals aren't actors,' says PETA's website, 'and yet thousands are forced to perform in zoos and circuses around the world every day.'
