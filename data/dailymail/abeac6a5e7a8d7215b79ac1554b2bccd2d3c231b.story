Google donated more money to political campaigns this year than global investment bank Goldman Sachs, it has been revealed.

The technology giant's political spending wing, NetPAC, spent $1.43 million attempting to guide policymakers' hands in Washington - $30,000 more than that shelled out by Goldman in the same period.

The figures, reveled by the Financial Times today, signal a dramatic surge in Google's political ambitions in recent years as it seeks to branch out from online search into other fields, from driverless cars to 'curing death'.

This rise is reflected in the fact that, in the build up to the midterms in 2010, Google spent just a third as much as Goldman.

Silicon Valley tech companies are investing heavily in political lobbying in a bid to gain greater influence over debates on issues such as tax, the greater allocation of visas to skilled migrant workers and greater control over U.S. intelligence agencies data-collection activities.

Microsoft was the biggest spender, donating $1.78 million, while Facebook spent £375,000 and Amazon paid $177,000. 

The Center for Responsive Politics found that, in 2010, Democratic federal candidates received 55 per cent of PAC contributions from tech firms, while Republicans received 45 per cent.

Microsoft: $1.78m  

Google: $1.43m 

Facebook: $375,000 

Amazon: $177,000 

Meanwhile, in 2014, the balance shifted as Democrats received 48 per cent of Silicon Valley donations to the Republicans' 52 per cent.

'The executives of those companies may not always agree with Republicans on social issues, but for a lot of them, at the end of the day, business is business,' said Reed Galen, a Republican consultant based in California.

Tech and internet donors have given almost $22.5 million so far in the 2014 election drive, according to the CRP.

It is still less than the $121 million donated by the securities and investment industry, but nevertheless shows a significant uplift in the tech industry's appetite for political sway.

Twitter and Yelp have both set up PACs in recent years, while Apple and Uber, who have not, have increased spending on political lobbyists.  

In the ten years since its IPO, Google has spent at least $23 billion buying more than 140 companies. They not only include YouTube and Android, but also firms specializing in robots, artificial intelligence, product-delivery drones, driverless cars and smart homes. Last year, Google acquired Calico, a biotech life-extension company with a mission, as Time Magazine wrote, to 'cure death'.
