Olympic hero Mo Farah won the hearts of the nation with his enthralling and epic battle to win double gold on the athletics track during London 2012.

But it seems the diminutive champion's fighting streak can be just as strong when out training.

The usually mild-mannered father-of-three has revealled how he came to blows with a man who refused to share a path in Richmond Park, London, along which Mo was trying to train.

The pair ended up rolling around in the mud during the fight on Christmas Day in 2009 and had to be separated by onlookers.

Revealing the incident in his autobiography, Farah said: 'It was a freezing cold morning.

'I was running up and down repeatedly on this one hill when I noticed a couple with a baby in a pushchair walking up the same hill.

'They were taking up nearly the entire path.

'After three or four attempts to run around the couple I got a bit fed up.

He said he told the man: 'Sorry, mate, would you mind moving just a little bit to the side of the path so I can run past? I’m training.'

But the man refused and Farah said he again asked him politely 'if he would consider moving', but the man again refused.

Mo Farah has been hailed as Britain’s greatest ever sporting champion.

The double-gold Olympian beat five-time gold winning rower Sir Steve Redgrave who came second in the poll for Great British Racing.

Cyclist Bradley Wiggins and current Olympic heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis came third and fourth respectively.

Wimbledon winner Andy Murray, David Beckham and track cyclist Sir Chris Hoy all featured at the top of the list.

Footballing legend Sir Bobby Moore, Dame Kelly Holmes and ice skating favourites Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean complete the top ten.

A Great British Racing spokesman said: 'These results are a wonderful reminder of Britain’s sporting prowess in so many different disciplines, by both men and women, over the past half century.

'As a country we must surely punch well above our weight. 

Farah said: 'Things quickly escalated into a heated argument.

'Neither of us would budge.

'All of a sudden the man stepped towards me, as if he wanted to fight.

'He was much taller and bigger than me but I did not want to back down.

'We were in each other’s faces.

'Then it all kicked off. Before I knew it, we were having a full-blown fight, rolling around on the ground, trading blows.

'Onlookers had to pull us apart before things got really bad.'

Afterwards he called his wife, Tania, who was at home preparing Christmas dinner and then the police arrived.

Farah said: 'I was caked in mud from where I’d been rolling around on the grass.

'There were nicks and cuts all over my face and I sported a massive bruise on my head.

'The
other guy looked the worse for wear too, and although I told the police
that he had attacked me first, they were reluctant to press charges 
because the guy looked as if he had come off worse in the scrap.

'I came home, cleaned up and changed and forgot about it.

'But it’s fair to say my Christmas Day got off to a bad start.'
