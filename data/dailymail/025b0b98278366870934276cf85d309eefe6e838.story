This is the dramatic moment a sailor had to be rescued from the sea after he was thrown from his powerboat which then started to circle him as he floated in the water.

The man was flung from the boat near the coast of the Isle of Barra in the Outer Hebrides after the steering mechanism jammed.

A member of the Barra lifeboat took these pictures of the boat after the crew had managed to pull the man from the water on Wednesday.

Out of control: The powerboat goes round in circles after the sailor was rescued because of the jammed steering mechanism

Rescue: The pictures were taken by a member of the lifeboat crew after they had rescued the man

The crew rescued the man after edging towards him while managing to stay clear of the motorboat.

The team than managed to throw a rope around the boat to bring it under control by snagging the propeller.

The man was then taken ashore by the lifeboat to Castlebay.

Martin MacLeod, second Coxswain on the Barra lifeboat, said: 'The steering broke, the boat lurched violently to one side and the man who was wearing a survival suit was thrown over board.

'It’s a good job we were able to get to him as quickly as we did.

'A yacht had also come to assist but they were unable to lift him aboard because his dry suit had partially filled with water, making him very heavy.

'We pulled him out of the water with the help of the A-frame which is a custom built piece of equipment fitted to the lifeboat to retrieve casualties from the water.'

The incident led the Marine Accident Investigation Branch to issue a warning for sailors to use a 'kill cord' which clips the driver to the boat’s engine cut-off cord - so they can deactivate the engine even if they fall out of the vessel.

Stornoway Coastguard watch manager Carol Collins said: 'Fortunately the casualty was wearing a wetsuit, otherwise it may have been a different outcome, even after only a short time in the water.

'He was also at risk of serious injury from his own vessel which continued to circle him with the outboard engine running.'
