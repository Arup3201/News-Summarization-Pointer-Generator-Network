Newly married and with a respectable job, he seems like an unlikely anarchist computer hacker.

But within months of posing for pictures with his wife at their lavish wedding, Ashley Rhodes helped launch cyber-attacks on global financial institutions causing multi-million-pound losses.

He was a member of the shadowy hacking group Anonymous, which ‘caused unprecedented harm’ to Visa, MasterCard and the online payment firm PayPal.

Jailed: 'Hactivist' Ashley Rhodes (pictured on his wedding day to wife Shirley) was nicknamed 'NikonElite'

Rhodes, 28, also discussed targeting the website of singer Lily Allen because of her stance against music piracy.

Eventually, he and the other 
self-styled ‘hacktivisits’ decided against such a cyber-attack because 
they believed attacking ‘artists’ was against their ideologies.

Rhodes, an IT worker, plotted the 
attacks at work on his office computer. He continued his cyber-crimes 
while at home with his new wife Shirley, who was unaware of his secret.

Rhodes met other members of Anonymous on the internet and together they discussed which companies they should target.

'Hactivists': Christopher Weatherhead (left), 22, of Northampton, was given an 18-month sentence and Ashley Rhodes (right), 28, of Camberwell, south London, was jailed for seven months at Southwark Crown Court

Avoided jail: Co-defendant Peter Gibson, 24, of Hartlepool, Durham, was deemed to have played a lesser role in the conspiracy, which he also admitted, and given a six-month suspended sentence

Yesterday Rhodes, of Camberwell, South
 London, was jailed for seven months after he admitted conspiring to 
impair the operation of computers.

'You've tried to bite the Anonymous hand. You angered the hive and now you are being stung'

Messages to victims' websites

His fellow conspirators, whom he had 
never met in person until he was charged, appeared next to him in the 
dock at Southwark Crown Court.

Christopher Weatherhead, 22, of 
Northampton, was given an 18-month sentence. Weatherhead, who used the 
online pseudonym Nerdo, denied conspiring to impair the operation of 
computers, but was convicted.

Peter Gibson, 24, of Hartlepool, was 
given a six-month suspended sentence after admitting the same charge. 
Both he and Weatherhead have degrees.

Jake Birchall, 18, from Chester, also 
admitted the charge and will be sentenced next Friday.

Hearing: A trial at Southwark Crown Court (pictured) in central London heard that PayPal was attacked repeatedly after it decided not to process payments on behalf of a group involved in raising funds for WikiLeaks

Anonymous 
launched their cyber campaign in 2010 as a sign of solidarity towards 
WikiLeaks. At the time WikiLeaks, which was founded by Julian Assange, 
had begun to publish sensitive state secrets.

'It is intolerable that when an individual or group disagrees with some particular entity’s activity they should be free to curtail that activity by way of attacks such as those that occurred in this case'

Judge Peter Testar

The gang targeted PayPal for refusing 
to process payments on behalf of Wau Holland Foundation, which was 
raising funds for WikiLeaks.

The nine-day online attack on PayPal 
cost the company £3.5million and delayed payments for gifts during the 
Christmas period.

It was so effective 104 staff were forced to put aside
 their usual tasks to create a defence strategy for PayPal.

Afterwards the hackers left a message 
which said: ‘You’ve tried to bite the Anonymous hand. You angered the 
hive and now you are being stung.’

Star: At one point Gibson suggested the website of singer Lily Allen, now known by her married name Lily Cooper, as a possible target to Rhodes, who agreed with the idea. But the attack never went ahead

The hackers paralysed computer systems by flooding the firms with an ‘intolerable number of online requests and messages’.

The financial impact of attacks on 
MasterCard and Visa were not revealed to the court.

But after targeting 
MasterCard, Weatherhead, who played ‘a leading role’ in the conspiracy, 
wrote to a fellow hacker: ‘We have probably done some million of pound 
of dmg [damage] to mc [MasterCard].’

Anonymous launched Operation Payback when they learnt that Pirate Bay, a pirate music site, was facing legal proceedings.

Believing music should be available 
for free on the internet, the hackers targeted the websites run by music
 industry regulators.

They also attacked four websites owned
 by the Ministry of Sound music company.

Big loss: PayPal was attacked for refusing to process payments on behalf of the Wau Holland Foundation, an organisation involved in raising funds for WikiLeaks. It cost the money transfer website £3.5million

At Weatherhead’s trial, 
prosecutor Sandip Patel said the campaign had ‘caused unprecedented 
harm’ to the companies whose computer systems they targeted.

Yesterday, Judge Peter Testar said their actions were ‘unacceptable’ and involved ‘serious offending’.

He added: ‘The world in which we live is such that everybody relies on the internet for everything, especially in commerce.

‘It is intolerable that when an 
individual or group disagrees with some particular entity’s activity 
they should be free to curtail that activity by way of attacks such as 
those that occurred in this case.’

Judge Testar said the attacks 
themselves were not particularly sophisticated but the group had gone to
 great lengths to protect their identities.

He commended the 
investigators for ‘breaking down the wall of anonymity’.

Masked: Anonymous has hit the headlines in the past for shutting down websites

Anonymous is a notorious group of hackers around the world who claim to have no central authority.

The group claimed responsibility for several high profile attacks last year, briefly shutting down the FBI and Justice Department websites in the
 U.S. after popular file-sharing website Megaupload was closed down.

They
 work by agreeing on targets in internet chat rooms and then attacking 
at the same time.

One of their most famous, and first, targets was the Church of Scientology in 2008.

Anonymous
 also attacked the Amazon, Visa, MasterCard and PayPal websites in 2010 
after the companies decided to stop working with Julian Assange’s 
controversial website WikiLeaks.

They
 have also attacked the websites of the Motion Picture Association of 
America and Recording Industry Association of America for tightly 
controlling copyright.
