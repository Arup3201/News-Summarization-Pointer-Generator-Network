An extremely rare photograph that captures almost the exact moment that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated is going up for auction next month.

By sheer chance, Mary Ann Moorman Krahmer captured the moment that the president clutched his throat, one-sixth of a second after being hit by an assassin's bullet in Dallas in 1963.

On November 15, one week after the famous photograph turns 50, it will go for up for sale at Cincinnati's Cowan's Auctions and is expected to fetch somewhere between $50,000 and $75,000.

Famous photo: Almost exactly 50 years after the assassination of President Kennedy a photograph showing the second he was shot is going up for auction

Krahmer tried to auction off the photo during the summer through Sotheby's in New York, but the Kennedy family intervened.

The family has a long-standing relationship with the auction house and officials said the photo was ‘too sensitive to auction.’

But the auction house in Cincinnati has had no such qualms.

‘This photograph has to be one of the most iconic photos of one of the most investigated moments of the 20th century,’ Wes Cowan told The Cincinnati Enquirer.

Mary Ann Moorman was a 31-year-old Texan housewife when she captured one of the most significant moments in American history with her polaroid camera

Moorman, now 81 and  living in Gainesville, Texas, says she doesn’t need the photo any longer as she has her memories.

The assassination of JFK happened at 12:30 p.m. on Nov. 22, 1963, in downtown Dallas when Lee Harvey Oswald's three rifle shots cut down the 46-year-old president.

Moorman, then a 31-year-old plumber’s wife and a friend has driven downtown more intent on seeing the glamorous Jackie Kennedy than her husband.

Using her a Polaroid instant camera, which had self-developing film that printed photos in seconds, Moorman caught the first shot that struck the president.

‘We were so close to the car, 10 to 12 feet away,’ she said, ‘I heard Jackie yell: “My God! He's been shot!'"

Moorman has admitted she was more interested in catching a glimpse of the very glamorous Jackie Kennedy rather than the President on the fateful day 50 years ago

The photo became hot property in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy and it was shown on TV within two hours of the incident occurring.

Government officials questioned Moorman and it was six hours later before she was finally allowed to leave the courthouse and return to her suburban Dallas home.

Then six hours later Government agents arrived asking for her photo, which was eventually returned weeks later sporting ‘a big thumbprint on it.’

Then in 1977, the House Select Committee on Assassinations subpoenaed the photograph and Moorman had to hire an attorney to get it back. Since then she has kept it in a safety deposit box until now.
