Voters would rather see Ed Miliband in charge of the economy than Boris Johnson, a new poll reveals in a blow to the London Mayor’s political ambitions.

Almost two thirds of people would not trust a Tory government led by Mr Johnson to take the right decisions to manage the economic recovery.

The findings lay bare the challenge he would face in proving that the country’s best known political joker was also capable of taking tough decisions for the country.

Challenge: Boris Johnson has been widely tipped as a future Prime Minister, but voters are not convinced the economy would be safe in his hands

The coalition is expected to be boosted by growth figures on Friday, which are expected to show the economy expanded by 0.7 per cent in the third quarter of 2013.

Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne have been bolstered by the sense that the recovery is gaining momentum but warn that Britain is not out of the woods yet.

Mr Johnson, long tipped as a future Tory leader, sought to present himself as a more serious political figure with a five-day visit to China.

Talking up immigration and investment in London, he backed Mandarin lessons in British schools and urged the UK government to give the go ahead for a new airport in the south east.

But attempts to sell Britain's relationship with China misfired with a Harry Potter analogy which lacked magic.

The London Mayor was talking up how closer links with China, claiming it was like the wizard's first girlfriend 'Cho Chang - who is a Chinese overseas student at Hogwarts school'.

However the boast quickly unravelled, with fans of the JK Rowling series pointing out that Cho Chang was British, and their relationship fell apart soon after starting.

In a poll commissioned to mark the fifth anniversary of the news that the British economy plunged into recession, Mr Johnson has not emerged as its saviour.

High flier: The London Mayor took a spectacular helicopter ride over Hong Kong as he arrived in the city as part of his trade mission to China last week

Fears: Almost two thirds of people fear Mr Johnson cannot be trusted with the economy

Just seven per cent of voters said they would trust Mr Johnson 'a great deal' with the economy and 20 per cent 'a fair amount', compared to 12 per cent and 23 per cent who backed a Tory government led by Mr Cameron.

Just over half of people (58 per cent) said they would not trust Mr Cameron with the economy, compared to almost two thirds (62 per cent) who said the same of the London Mayor.

It means Mr Cameron had a net score of -23 per cent, much better than -35 per cent for a Conservative government led by Mr Johnson.

A Labour government led by Ed Miliband had a net rating of -32 per cent, also better than Mr Johnson.

The next preferred option was a power-sharing deal between Mr Cameron's Tories and Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats.

Voters were less impressed by a Lib-Con coalition with Vince Cable leading the Lib Dems, with only a net rating of -44 per cent.

A Labour-Lib Dem coalition between Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg had a net trust rating of -53 per cent, the worst of all options put to the people polled.

The YouGov poll was commissioned lobbying and media relations firm PLMR.

Kevin Craig, managing director of PLMR, said: ‘On the 5th anniversary of the start recession we wanted to see who the British public trusts most to lead us into a recovery, and the results are not encouraging for any of the contenders. 

‘There is a hint that local politicians seem to, “Get it” a little more than the national leadership contenders but clearly all politicians have work to do when it comes to inspiring confidence in their economic policies.’
