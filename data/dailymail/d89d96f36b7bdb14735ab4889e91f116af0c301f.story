The US has announced plans to place 50 nuclear missiles in storage as part of a controversial arms treaty with Russia.

The Pentagon said it would be keeping its current force of 450 land-based missiles, but has agreed to remove 50 of them from launch silos - although it added these silos would be maintained so they could return to active use in future.

The removal is part of a plan to bring the US into compliance with an 2011 arms control treaty with Russia known as New START - which has the subject of intense debate between U.S. politicians and weapons experts when plans were announced ahead of the 2010 mid-term elections.

Defence: A Minuteman III rocket is launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The test base is one of the sites that will not be hit with missile reductions

Aim: U.S. President Barack Obama shake hands with his Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev, after signing the controversial New START treaty in 2011

Once the 50 nuclear missiles are placed in storage, the launch-ready total of 400 
Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles would be the lowest the US has had since 1962

The decision to keep the silos in 'warm' status - empty of missiles but capable of returning to active use - comes after members of Congress from the states that host missile bases - North Dakota, Wyoming and Montana - warned they must not be dismantled.

Senator John Tester, a Montana Democrat, called the Pentagon's announcement 'a big win for our nation's security and for Malmstrom Air Force Base,' home of the 341st Missile Wing with 150 Minuteman 3 missiles.

'ICBMs
 are the most cost-effective nuclear deterrent, and keeping silos warm 
is a smart decision and the kind of common sense Montanans expect from 
their leaders,' he added.

The decision to put 50 missiles in 
storage but not eliminate any of their launch silos is a departure from 
the practice followed throughout the 50-plus year history of 
intercontinental ballistic missiles.

A
 senior defense official who briefed reporters on the plan and its 
rationale said the Pentagon had never before structured its ICBM force 
with a substantial number of missiles in standby status.

The official spoke under Pentagon ground rules that did not permit her name to be used.

In the air: U.S. Air Force strategic bombers will be trimmed from the current deployed total of 93 to 60 - including 19 B-2 stealth bombers (pictured) - with an additional six bombers available in a non-deployed status

Despite the 2011 New START deal, both Russia and the US have an extensive nuclear weapons arsenal.

In US hands there are approximately 5,114 nuclear warheads, including tactical, strategic, and non-deployed weapons.

According to the latest official New START declaration, the United States deploys 1,654 strategic nuclear warheads on 792 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and strategic bombers.

The Federation of American Scientists estimates the United States' non-deployed strategic arsenal is approximately 2,800 warheads, with a tactical nuclear arsenal numbering 500 warheads.

An unconfirmed number of additional US warheads are awaiting dismantlement.

Russia, meanwhile, is estimated to have approximately 1,480 deployed strategic warheads, with another 1,022 in non-deployed status.

It is thought Russia may have several thousand additional warheads awaiting dismantlement.

The decision was not met with universal praise however.

Hans Kristensen, an arms control expert at the Federation of American Scientists, called the administration's announcement disappointing and a shift away from nuclear weapon reductions.

'This decision appears to have more to do with the administration surrendering to the ICBM caucus [in Congress] than with strategic considerations about national security, he said.

The Pentagon said it will cost $19.3million over five years to keep the 50 launch silos and missiles in standby status.

The missiles themselves will be stored at the base or, in some cases, sent to a depot for repairs or maintenance.

Keeping all 450 silos meant the Pentagon had to make steeper reductions in the Navy's sea-based nuclear force in order to comply with the New START, or Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, by 2018.

The US Navy will reduce the number of deployed and non-deployed submarine-launched ballistic nuclear missiles to 280 from the current 336.

Decrease: Russia is already is well below the 700-deployed weapon limit and, at the most recent reporting period last October, had only 473 compared to 809 in U.S. hands. Pictured are Russian Topol ICBMs missiles

The Navy has 14 Ohio-class submarines 
armed with missiles but only 12 will count as deployed because two will 
be undergoing long-term maintenance at a given time during the 10-year 
life of the New START treaty.

The Navy is embarking on a multibillion-dollar program to build a replacement for the current fleet.

The
 other 'leg' of the US nuclear force, the Air Force strategic bombers,
 will be trimmed from the current deployed total of 93 to 60, with an 
additional six available in a non-deployed status.

The 60 will comprise 19 B-2 stealth bombers and 41 B-52H Stratofortress heavy bombers.

The reductions ensure the US remains within the New START limit of 700 deployed strategic nuclear weapons with 400 ICBMs, 240 sub-launched missiles and 60 bombers.

Russia
 is already is well below the 700-deployed weapon limit and, at the most
 recent reporting period last October, had only 473 compared to 809 in 
US hands.

The value of the
 US keeping the missiles in storage has been questioned, especially 
after the Pentagon announced the total cost of the New START changes is 
estimated at Â£300million by 2018.

In
 addition to the 450 ICBM silos currently in use, the US Air Force has
 four at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California that are only used for 
test launches.

These test silos will remain in place.

The 2011 New START Treaty is an agreement between Russia and the US to reduce their nuclear weapons arsenals.

It replaced the expiring Treaty of Moscow and required both countries to halve its number of nuclear weapons over the 10 years to 2021.

A clause in the agreement means each country must also have a maximum of 700 deployed missiles and bombers, 1,550 deployed warheads and 800 deployed or non-deployed missile launchers by 2018.

The New START Treaty replaced the expiring Treaty of Moscow and required both countries to halve the number of nuclear weapons over the 10 years to 2021

The agreement was controversial from the start, prompting intense public debate during the 2010 US mid-term elections.

While arms control experts widely praised the idea of continued nuclear reduction, others accused Russia of 'cheating' on similar past agreements, adding that a further reduction would leave the US vulnerable to attack.

2012 U.S. presidential hopeful Mitt Romney was among those against the Treaty.

The allegations of 'cheating' - which were made the Republican Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe during the Senatorial debate - caused outrage in the Russian media.

The debate died down somewhat in 2012 when an official Pentagon report into the Treaty was published.

The report found that found that even if Russia did 'cheat' on the agreement and attack the US, the Treaty would have 'little to no effect' on US nuclear retaliatory capabilities.
