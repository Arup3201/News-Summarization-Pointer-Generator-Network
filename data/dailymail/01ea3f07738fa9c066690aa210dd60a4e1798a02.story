The NHS is paying stand-in A&E doctors £2,000 a day because staff are refusing to work permanently in hospitals they have likened to ‘war zones’.

Hospitals are being forced to spend tens of millions of pounds on commission to agencies to arrange cover for shifts at understaffed departments, The Times reported last night.

Desperate trusts are hiring temporary doctors to fill gaps during busy times, with a fifth of the £855million NHS locum bill being spent in Accident and Emergency units.

Hospitals are being forced to pay locum doctors up to £2k a day to work in 'war zone' casualty departments 

One locum GP said he covers four shifts a month in an un-named unit (not pictured) to top up his wages  

According to a detailed analysis of NHS spending on locums, even the most junior doctors are earning up to £1,000 a day.

Hospitals have spent a record amount of almost £1billion on agency doctors and nurses in six months.

Doctors said working conditions in some A&E units were so bad that staff did not want to sign up full-time – leading to acute shortages. Others say there is little incentive for doctors to take a permanent job when temporary work can pay so well.

Patients’ leaders attacked the payments as a waste of money and urged the NHS to focus on training, hiring and retaining skilled doctors.

Consultants in general medicine have been paid up to £175 an hour, while A&E consultants receive an average rate of £90 per hour, which can rise to £142. Stand-in dentists receive an average rate of £111 an hour and commission fees paid to agencies can add up to £25 an hour in some fields. Even doctors only two years out of medical school have been paid £100 an hour to work on maternity units.

The average NHS consultant receives basic pay of £89,000 and total earnings with bonuses and other payments of £111,000. The figures are contained in an analysis of 39 hospitals by Liaison – a financial services company employed by hospitals to help manage their spending on agency staff. Andrew Armitage, the company’s managing director, said many hospitals did not know whether they were paying too much for staff.

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, labelled the figures ‘truly shocking’. She added: ‘The NHS should start focusing more resources on hiring and retaining skilled doctors and stop the wastage spent on temporary staff.’

A locum GP, who asked not to be named, compared A&E to a war zone.

The 35-year-old does three or four shifts a month in hospitals, for £800 a time, to top up his salary, but says some colleagues are able to work full-time as locums.

He said: ‘There’s camaraderie and a real sense of purpose – but you wouldn’t want to work there every day. The pay is good but it’s stressful work, and draining.’
