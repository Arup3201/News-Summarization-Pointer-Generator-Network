With more of us sharing almost every aspect of our lives online it raises the serious question about what happens to all of this data when we die.

Facebook posts and tweets may seem mundane or trivial but, along with emails, online photos, contacts and even the login details for online banking, they create what’s called a ‘digital legacy.’

The latest company to let users create a will for these online accounts is Perpetu and it differs from most other services because it lets its members hand-pick exactly which information from which sites go to which people.

Hong Kong startup Perpetu lets users select which online information they want to share with which relatives after they die. They are then given a unique code that can be passed to family members or written in a will. When they die, relatives let Perpetu know and the site releases the relevant information

It also generates a unique code for each member that can be written into paper wills, for example, or shared with loved ones meaning the user don’t have to give out passwords.

Perpetu members can add Facebook and Twitter accounts for free, or pay $15 (£9) a year, or a one-time payment of $100 (£61), to connect LinkedIn, Gmail, Dropbox, Flickr and Github accounts.

Current legislation means that if a person doesn’t leave information about online accounts in a will, family members must apply for a court order to get access to them.

Certain sites, including Facebook, can memorialise profiles if a family member asks them to, but others, such 
as Gmail, will delete inactive accounts after a set period of time. 

With Perpetu, users can not only select
 which people are sent which information from different sites, it also 
lets users select what to delete.

This can prevent family members 
reading personal information that the user may not want them to see, for
 example.

With Perpetu, users can not only select which people are sent which information from which sites, it also lets users select what to delete. Members can also write final wall posts for Facebook and Twitter, or set auto-replies for emails

Members can also write final wall 
posts for Facebook and Twitter, or set auto-replies for emails. Future 
emails can additionally be set up to be forwarded to a certain address 
after someone dies.

To make sure people are dead before 
releasing the information, Perpetu will email and phone the member, to confirm.

If the user doesn’t reply within a week, Perpetu will carry out their final online wishes.

'For companies like Yahoo, Facebook and Google, they are not putting enough effort into dealing with dead users’ accounts. It doesn’t get them any more data. There’s no incentive for them,' creator Ryanne Lai told TechCrunch.

Users sign up to Perpetu either using an email address, or by connecting their Facebook or Twitter account. 

Facebook and Twitter are free, or users can pay $15 (£9) a year, or a one-time payment of $100 (£61), to connect LinkedIn, Gmail, Dropbox, Flickr and Github accounts.

Perpetu members can then go through each connected service and select who gets what. 

For example, upon death a user could choose to have their Facebook posts and photos emailed to select people. The site also lets users select exactly which albums go to which people. 

Members can also write final wall posts for Facebook and Twitter, or set auto-replies for emails.

Future emails can additionally be set up to be forwarded to a certain address after someone dies. 

Once the account is activated, each user is given a unique code that can be written in a physical will or shared with family and friends. 

Upon someone’s death, the family will let Perpetu know and give them this unique code. Perpetu then carries out that person’s final wishes.

Family members don’t get given access to any of the individual accounts, or access to the Perpetu account.
