She achieved fame with her soiled unmade bed, and a tent stitched with the names of everyone she slept with, but now Tracey Emin is heading in a new direction - as a professor.

The controversial British artist is to become the new 
Professor of Drawing at London's prestigious Royal Academy, the 
country's oldest art school.

However, the move has sparked outrage at the revered establishment, whose past luminaries include William Turner, John Constable and William Blake.

Figurative
 painter Diana Armfield - whose work is in the collection of the British
 Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum - told the Times she had seen
 what 'I suppose are 
drawings' by Emin, but that she "wouldn't have thought that her talents 
were that way".'

Tracey Emin is to become Professor of Drawing at the Royal Academy, but some members are unhappy with the decision. Pictured, the artist with her work entitled Those Who Suffer Love, at London's White Cube gallery in 2009

Other members of the Royal Academy have also protested against the 48-year-old's appointment but did not wish to comment publicly.

The decision to appoint Emin was made last Thursday by the General 
Assembly of Royal Academicians (RAs) - an illustrious club of 
sculptors, architects, printmakers and painters - but a formal announcement has not yet taken 
place.

Other figures in the art world have supported Emin's selection and believe it will help to boost the nation's interest in drawing.

Tate
 Galleries director Nicholas Serota said: 'There 
will be a lot of people who say, "What a lousy idea, she doesn't stand 
for classical drawing", but I think it's a great appointment.

Emin shot to fame in the 1990s as one of the leading members of the Young British Artists movement. Above is her 1998 work, My Bed

'Drawing
 is the foundation for everything she does and I think it's the thing 
for which she is most recognised internationally as well,' he told the newspaper.

Painter
 Anthony Green, who backed Emin's election to the academy in 2007, said:
 'She draws at the speed of thought, which is a very rare ability.'

Among
 her latest works is an official poster for the London 2012 Olympics, 
entitled Birds - a simple sketch, for the Paralympics, of two birds.

The laws
of the academy, based in Piccadilly, central London, state its professors are 'required to deliver annually a course of lectures, or conduct seminars,
adapted to the arts of design, in their respective subjects'.

Fellow
artists Fiona Rae and Richard Wilson have been made professors of painting and
sculpture respectively.

Royal
Academy president Christopher Le Brun said: 'We are delighted at these new
appointments.

'Tracey Emin, Fiona Rae and Richard Wilson join an esteemed list
of artists who have held these positions.'

Eileen
Cooper, keeper of the Royal Academy Schools, said: 'In the history of the
Royal Academy, we have never had a female professor before - and now we have
two. I'm both proud and delighted by this development.'

Emin was brought up in Margate, south-east England, and now lives in east London.

She earned a master's degree at the Royal College of Art.

She
 shot to fame in the 1990s as one of the leading members of the Young 
British Artists movement.

Recently, she exhibited her biggest career 
retrospective at London's Hayward Gallery.
