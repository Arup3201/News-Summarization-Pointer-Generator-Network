Wayne Rooney is fit for the Manchester derby this weekend.

Rooney gave Manchester United a scare on Monday when he limped away from Carrington after training.

However, it is understood that the United captain trained fully on Wednesday and will play at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.

Rooney has not played since last month after serving a three-game ban for a sending-off against West Ham.

United manager Louis van Gaal has told Rooney he will definitely start and it remains to be seen who makes way.

Robin van Persie could be the one to suffer after a series of indifferent performances, despite scoring a late equaliser against Chelsea at Old Trafford last Sunday.

Meanwhile, former United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel now believes Manchester City are a ‘bigger club’ than their local rivals based on recent form.

During his eight years at Old Trafford, Schmeichel did not lose one Manchester derby and United were undoubtedly superior to City.

But the 50-year-old thinks the balance of power has well and truly shifted in City’s favour. 

‘In my first couple of years at United I didn’t understand the rivalry with City. Liverpool and Leeds were much bigger,’ Schmeichel told BBC Sport.

‘Now it’s different. Man City are the champions, they won their second Premier League title last season and maybe at the moment they are a bigger club than Manchester United in terms of results so the significance has changed.’

The Champions League winner is still very much a United fan, though, and admits playing against Sir Alex Ferguson’s team in City blue was a ‘very weird’ experience.

Like many other United supporters, Schmeichel has become concerned by the inconsistency shown by the team since Ferguson retired. ‘The derby is a tricky one for United because of their inconsistency,’ he said. ‘We don’t know what we will get on Sunday.’
