It is feared a deadly drug known as 'cannibal heroin' which eats flesh from the inside out is about to hit the UK.

Krokodil, which is like heroin and originated in Russia 10 years ago, turns users into zombies as their bodies begin to rot leaving addicts with reptilian skin. 

But the homemade concoction can be up to 10 times cheaper than heroin and is created by mixing codeine with gasoline or oil.

Blind victim Margarita Schelkunova, 28, at a rehab centre in Siberia began using Krokodil seven years ago

Within 30 minutes the substance, medically known as desomorphine, is cooked up before it is injected into the user's veins. 

But the results are catastrophic.

Continual use of Krokodil, Russian for crocodile, causes blood vessels to burst, leaving skin green and scaly among addicts eventually causing gangrene and their flesh to begin to rot.

In Russia around 30,000 people die from the affects of the drug every year yet it is thought about a quarter of a million people in the country are now hooked on the poison.

Addiction is spreading among young people and even those who manage to quit come away disfigured for life.

Margarita Schelkunova, 28, and her husband became hooked on the drug seven years ago. 

Even though Miss Schelkunova is now clean, she has lost her sight and has been diagnosed with cancer and HIV with only weeks to live.

Her husband died at the age of 27.

But Irina Dyadyuchenko, 35, has survived being a Krokodil addict and has now been clean for two years.

She began using heroin at the age of 14 but when her local drug dealers were jailed she turned to Krokodil to get her fix.

Irina, who is the daughter of an engineer and teacher, said when the recipe landed in Russia, she soon realised she could make it herself with one dose costing around £4.

Krokodil has already hit the U.S. already trying to tackle huge numbers of people using homemade drug crystal meth.

However, one British doctor believes he may have came across a case in the UK. 

Dr Allan Harris, a GP in Gloucester, wrote in an article for The Independent that the man was homeless and in his 30s. 

'There was essentially a crater in his arm and you could see the bone and tendons,' he wrote.

'It is hugely addictive and potent and can be cooked up in 30 minutes. It's only a matter of time before we start seeing it in Britain. It is not a case of 'if' but 'when'. 

Norman Baker, minister for crime prevention, told The Sun: 'Desomorphine - krokodil - is controlled as a Class A drug in the UK because it is dangerous.

'We are determined to tackle the illicit drug trade which can have such a destructive impact on the lives of so many.'

Krokodil's medical name is desomorphine and is created by mixing codeine with gasoline, paint thinner, hydrochloric acid, iodine and red phosphorous.

There are millions of users in Russia and the epidemic began in Siberia and the Russian Far East.

The drug causes flesh to rot from the inside out and the addict's skin becomes scaly, like a crocodile's, hence the name.

Blood vessels burst and the surrounding tissue dies. Gangrene and amputations are a common result and sometimes bone can be exposed.

The high lasts for about an hour and a half and the drug can be up to 10 times cheaper than heroin.
