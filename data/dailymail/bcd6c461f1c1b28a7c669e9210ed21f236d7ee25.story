Police smashed their way into a fisherman's car and towed it away to a pound - after they thought his fly-ridden tackle box was a decomposing corpse.

Officers were called to a car park in North Walsham, Norfolk, after a panicked passer-by dialled 999 when he spotted a swarm of blue bottles in George Wallis' Chrysler Neon.

They smashed the vehicle's rear window but were left red-faced, when the flies turned out to have hatched from maggots left in a bait box in the car four days earlier.

After attempting to contact Mr Wallis, police towed the car to Great Yarmouth, with its owner hit with a £150 towing fee and a £20-a-day storage charge.

But Mr Wallis says he will have to pay £75 to have the car scrapped as he can't afford the charges.

He says that the police should foot the bill for the damaged caused.

He told the Daily Telegraph: 'The police made my vehicle insecure by breaking into it, they should pay not me.

''I can't afford to get it back, but I need a vehicle.'

A spokesman for Norfolk Constabulary said that the car had a flat tyre and appeared to to be abandoned.

He added: 'The officer had genuine concerns about what could have been in the vehicle.

'If the owner feels they shouldn't pay, they can write to legal services at force headquarters.'
