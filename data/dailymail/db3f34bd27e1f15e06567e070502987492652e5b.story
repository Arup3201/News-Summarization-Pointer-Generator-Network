David Cameron and Ed Miliband were ordered to get tough on immigration today – or lose even more support to Ukip following last night’s shock by-election results.

Nigel Farage’s party handed the Tories a drubbing in Clacton – and only narrowly missed out on a second win in the safe Labour seat of Heywood and Middleton  after a dramatic late surge in support for Ukip.

Tory defector Douglas Carswell became the party's first elected MP, winning his Essex constituency with a 12,404 majority, while Labour's Liz McInnes held on in Greater Manchester by just 617 votes.

Tory and Labour MPs united today to urge their party leaders to take action on immigration to show they understood why voters were turning to Ukip.

Nigel Farage today called for all immigrants with 'life threatening' illnesses to be blocked from coming to the UK

It comes after immigration figures showed David Cameron was losing his battle to reduce net immigration to ‘tens of thousands’ a year – which he pledged at the last election.

Official figures show the number of migrants arriving in Britain outstrips those leaving by almost 250,000 a year – similar to the levels seen under Labour after the borders were opened to eastern European migrants in 2004.

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘There is more we need to do to listen to people who are voting UKIP, particularly on immigration and I’d be the first to say that.’

He said: ‘In my own constituency there will be traditional Labour voters with the same concerns about immigration – absolutely we need to hear those concerns and act on their concerns.’

Mr Burnham said he could not defend immigrants ‘sending back benefits’ to their families in Europe.

He said: ‘I think it doesn't meet most people's test of basic fairness, you know, that you haven't contributed but then you can take out. And that has to change.

‘I think what they don't agree with is the idea that people can then just arrive and take benefits and send them back, and that needs to change. And Ed Miliband and Ed Balls have both said it needs to change.’ 

Labour leader Ed Miliband today said it was not prejudiced to be concerned about immigration - but insisted capping the number of migrants coming to Britain would not work

Tory Local Government minister Brandon Lewis insisted the Government were acting to cut migration.

He said the Conservatives would put immigration ‘at the heart’ of renegotiation ahead of the EU referendum in 2017.

‘What people are worried about though is that migration from the EU, and the Prime Minister as I say made it very clear last week that's got to be one of the key things at the heart of renegotiation that we will have before that referendum which we will deliver in 2017.’

Labour MP John Mann challenged Ed Miliband to ‘step up to the mark’ after the surge in support for Ukip in yesterday’s two by-elections.

He said: ‘People want action, not listening, on the big issues – and the big issues include immigration.

‘People feel that the speed of immigration into this country is too fast, that the price that people are paying in terms of lower pay, in terms of forced housebuilding in areas in the north is too big.

‘And we need some action to demonstrate that Labour not just is listening, but is prepared to do something on these concerns.

‘What he should say is that we want to have and will get back from Europe the right to determine the numbers coming in and the skills coming in so that we have that power.

‘That’s the fundamental change that’s needed. And so, yes, at the moment, that would mean a reduction in numbers without question.’

The Prime Minister is failing to fulfil his pledge to reduce net migration to less than 100,000 a year

Douglas Carswell was one of the most prominent Eurosceptic Tory MPs but his defection to Ukip in August was still a major surprise in Westminster.

The libertarian Clacton MP regularly spoke out against the Government on Europe, the economy and Parliamentary reform.

The maverick backbencher once led calls for MPs' expenses to be opened up to the public– but was then criticised after it emerged he claimed cash back for a 'love chair' for his home. 

In Clacton his popularity outstrips that of the Tories. One senior Conservative said: 'There is not a Tory machine campaign machine in Clacton, it is a Carswell machine.'

Mr Carswell grew up in Uganda where his doctor parents worked. He was educated at St Andrews School, Kenya, before moving to the exclusive Charterhouse boarding school in Surrey.

Fellow Labour MP Jack Straw said Labour needed a stronger message on immigration to address the surge in support for Ukip.

He said: ‘But there are lessons in this by-election result. We were right to concentrate on the NHS; we’ve also, however, got to be stronger about our messages on immigration as well.’

Tory MP Mark Pritchard claimed Ukip voters needed to understand that the only way to get tougher controls on immigration was to vote Tory.

He said: ‘The only way we’re going to have that referendum, the only way we’re going to deliver even tougher immigration controls, the only way we’re going to continue to grow the economy in the way that we’ve seen over the last few years is under a Conservative government, under a Conservative prime minister; not under Douglas Carswell, Nigel Farage, Ed Miliband, whoever it might be.’

Fellow Conservative backbencher Bernard Jenkin said politics needed ‘far less fudging’ and ‘far more talking about how things really are’.

He said: ‘For example, if you want to control EU immigration we're going to have to take back control over our borders.’

Last night's by-election results left Ed Miliband in pole position to be the next Prime Minister, Mr Cameron claimed today.

The Prime Minister said: ‘What last night demonstrates is that if you see a big Ukip vote, you will end up with Ed Miliband as Prime Minister, Ed Balls as Chancellor and Labour in power.'

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps added: ‘Let me be blunt. What we have seen is a simple truth. This just puts Miliband closer to victory. This has just made his job of getting into Number 10 easier.'

Mr Miliband this afternoon appeared to agree with the Tory response. He said: ‘The Tories are a party losing in their own backyard and retreating from what they used to call their own frontline. The Tories are a party that cannot win a majority at the next general election.’

Nigel Farage said Ukip was making 'staggering gains in stridently Labour territory' after Mr Carswell's victory

Ukip's next target is Rochester and Strood, where Mr Carswell's fellow defector Mark Reckless is hoping to return to Parliament.

Mr Carswell said: 'In Rochester, as in Clacton, I believe voters will reject negative campaigns by old party machines.'

This morning Mr Farage claimed more MPs were likely to defect to Ukip within the next few months - including Labour backbenchers.
