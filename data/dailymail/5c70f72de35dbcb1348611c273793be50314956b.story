David de Gea (Man United, signed for £19m), Alvaro Arbeloa (Real Madrid, £3.5m), Gerard Pique (Barcelona, £5m), Carles Puyol (Barcelona), Nacho Monreal (Arsenal, £8.5m), Javi Garcia (Manchester City £15.8m), Isco (Real Madrid, £23m), Juan Mata (Man United £37.2m), Fernando Torres (Chelsea, £50m), Fernando Llorente (Juventus, free), David Villa (Atletico Madrid, £4.4m)

Combined market value: £166.4m

When people discuss who will be lifting the World Cup on June 13, England barely register.

Hosts Brazil, Argentina, Germany and holders Spain tend to be most people’s pick. An optimistic punter may even have a flutter on dark horses like Italy, Holland or even Belgium, but Roy Hodgson’s side are given scant chance of winning their second World Cup this time around.

One reason for this pessimism is the strength of the squad at Hodgson's disposal when compared to the giants of Europe and South America. 

For instance, a slick, strong Spain squad face Italy on Wednesday evening, boasting the likes of Sergio Ramos, Xabi Alonso, Andres Iniesta and Manchester City duo Alvaro Negredo and David Silva.

In the cold: David Villa (right) is out of the squad but team-mate Diego Costa will make his debut against Italy

Casillas, Reina, Valdes; Juanfran, Albiol, Ramos, Martinez, Jordi Alba, Azpilicueta; Xavi, Busquets, Alonso, Koke, Iniesta, Cazorla, Fabregas, Thiago Alcantara, Silva; Negredo, Navas, Pedro, Diego Costa 

But there are a number of Spain players who could do some serious damage on the world stage who haven’t been included in Vicente del Bosque’s party for the Madrid game. 

In fact, we’ve compiled an alternative Spain XI of players who haven’t made Del Bosque’s squad. Among them are Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea, Real Madrid’s fledgling playmaker Isco and Atletico Madrid hotshot David Villa.

United's £37million signing Juan Mata isn't involved and Juventus hitman Fernando Llorente has also been overlooked.

Villa and Chelsea's £50m signing Fernando Torres were part of the Spain set-up for their historic three consecutive major-tournament wins, but both have been omitted to make way for Atletico Madrid's Brazil-born striker Diego Costa and Negredo.

Of our XI, only Barcelona’s Gerard Pique is injured - but the remainder have been left out or rested - and this team would surely prove difficult opposition if pitted against, say, England.

Then and now: Fernando Torres lifts the European Championship trophy (left) but the Chelsea man may find it difficult to force his way into the team with the likes of Alvaro Negredo and Diego Costa finding the goals

Battle on the left: Barcelona's Jordi Alba (left) is keeping Nacho Monreal out of the Spain side

Mixed bag: Gerard Pique (left) looks certain to be in Brazil but will Llorente be part of another winning team?

In fact, almost all of them would waltz straight into Roy Hodgson's starting line-up. Each one is a regular in a Champions League knock-out-stage team and have a combined value of around £166m.

Admittedly, Del Bosque will field a mix of experienced and fringe players against the Italians, but Spain’s astonishing strength in depth isn’t just a worry for England. 

The fact that they have eleven players that haven’t made the squad for one of the final friendlies before their World Cup defence who have accrued millions of pounds in transfers and a ton of silverware should send shivers through the spines of the other big nations heading into the tournament.

Brazil seemed to manage OK in the Confederations Cup final at the Maracana, mind.

Not this time: Carles Puyol (left) and Alvaro Arbeloa won't take part in the match against Cesare Prandelli's men

A striking difference: The men who could leave Torres in the cold

Fernando Torres, who has won three consecutive major tournaments with Spain, may struggle to force his way into the squad after being dropped along with David Villa for the upcoming friendly against Italy.

Vicente del Bosque likes to deploy one man up top, and it appears as though Torres is not his man.

Alvaro Negredo has embraced the rough and tumble of the Premier League since joining Manchester City last summer from Sevilla. He's also operated well as the spearhead of Del Bosque's in recent qualifiers and friendlies.

Lethal: Alvaro Negredo

U-Turn: Costa now plays for Spain

Flying: Pedro is in good form

On the wane? Villa (left) and Torres have been left out for the friendly against Italy

Meanwhile, Diego Costa has decided to
 play for Spain over Brazil. Del Bosque will find it hard to ignore a 
player who has netted 26 times this season with Atletico Madrid, despite
 his penchants for controversy.

Barcelona
 have another attacking gem in Pedro. The fleet-footed wide man isn't as
 advanced as an out-and-out striker, but he's versatile and his ability 
to ghost in from the flank has seen him snatch 14 goals so far this 
campaign.

And then there's 
Villa. At 32, he hasn't hit the heights of his earlier career in terms 
of goals, but has built up a solid partnership with Costa at Atletico. 
Villa has managed to find the back of the net 11 times this season

Those who aren't in Del Bosque's squad just yet needn't be too concerned though.

'This list is exclusively for the game against Italy," He said after announcing his 22 players. 'There are three months left of competition and many things can happen to convince us to bring other players. We don't close the door to anything.
