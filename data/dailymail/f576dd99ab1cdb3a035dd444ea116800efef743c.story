Dark clouds in the ski and a rather formidable storm is heading towards Naomi Broady, who faces Caroline Wozniacki in the second round. 

Broadie indicated after winning her first-round match on Monday that she wouldn’t begin video analysis of the Dane until today. She might want to start cramming – or avoid the videos altogether.

Wozniacki needed to return to the All England Club on Tuesday to resume her first-round tie with Shahar Peer, which was interrupted by rain on Monday with the former world No 1 leading 6-3, 2-0.

What followed might prove intimidating for Broadie.

They resumed at 30-30 in the third game of the second set Wozniacki promptly broke serve to lead 3-0. The next three games were rattled off in roughly 10 minutes, Wozniacki crushing the Israeli with her groundstrokes.

The Dane, whose relationship with golfer Rory McIlroy ended recently, has slipped down the rankings. She is currently seeded 16th after a significant loss in form and has not gone past the second round here since 2011.
