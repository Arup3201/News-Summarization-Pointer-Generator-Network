A town was left fuming after it was revealed the celebrity guest opening its Christmas market was the one and only Chesney Hawkes.

Residents in Hastings, East Sussex were kept waiting for the grand unveiling of the mystery star, with rumours circulating that local celeb and Madness frontman Suggs would be making an appearance.

But their excitement was soon dampened when Chesney Hawkes was revealed as the guest to open the Christmas stalls and ice rink.

People in seaside town Hastings, East Sussex, were left fuming after the 'celebrity' booked to open a Christmas market and festive ice rink was unveiled as one-hit-wonder Chesney Hawkes

Locals have now launched a Go Away Chesney campaign and took to the internet to vent their anger.

One person tweeted: '90s legend. Will
be a bit long in the tooth by now – we’re planning a Go Away Chesney 
protest when he arrives here – if anyone can recognise him.”

Another wrote: 'Is this a joke?! If not, not exactly pushing the boat out.'

Singer Chesney Hawkes has been revealed as the celebrity to open the Christmas market in Hastings, much to the dismay of locals

Hastings boasts several other singers and celebs who were either born in the town or live there now, who have had scores of hits, such as Graham McPherson, Suggs from Madness.

Madness spent 214 weeks in the charts between 1980 and 1986 - the most of any band in the UK in the 80s - with hits like Baggy Trousers and Our House and have multiple platinum albums.

Erasure singer Andy Bell, who lives in Hastings, sold more than 25m albums worldwide, with hits including A Little Respect, Always and Chains of Love.

Other celebs with links to the seaside town include pop guru Simon Fuller, who was born in Hastings, Have I Got News for You funnyman Paul Merton and comic Jo Brand.

Simon Mills, 43, said: 'Hastings has a long line of celebrities, including Suggs and Andy Bell, so why in the world would Chesney Hawkes be chosen to open the Christmas market?'

Another local called Wendy said: 'Is this the best we can do?

'Why couldn't we have Mick Jagger or Rod Stewart? Or even good old Cliff?

'The one and only Chesney Hawkes? - you said it mate.'

Chesney, 41, is best known for his number one hit The One and Only, which topped the charts in 1991.

Although Chesney has since dabbled with fame he now plays gigs at freshers week events at universities around the UK.

He was due to take part on ITV1's skating
programme Dancing on Ice last year but after fracturing his ankle he 
had to pull out. He was replaced by Chico Slimani.

Roger Crouch, who booked Chesney for the
openings on December 6, said: 'This is great for Hastings, as we are 
trying to create a truly magical Christmas.'

A spokesman for Chesney Hawkes said yesterday that the singer couldn't comment as he was 'away filming'.

The spokesman for GB Music said: 'We were approached for Chesney to fulfil this engagement, he was free and agreed to do it.'
