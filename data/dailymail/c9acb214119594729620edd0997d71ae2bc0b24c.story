France was rocked by a further downgrade to its credit rating yesterday as the country’s economic woes mounted.

Credit agency Standard & Poor’s cut its rating on French debt from AA+ to AA in a humiliating setback for President Francois Hollande and his socialist administration.

In a devastating analysis, the agency highlighted the risks posed by weak economic growth, high unemployment, the rising national debt and ‘elevated’ levels of tax and spending.

The move, which made a mockery of Mr Hollande’s claim in August that ‘the recovery is here’, sparked a furious reaction in Paris.

Finance minister Pierre Moscovici said: ‘I deplore certain judgments that, I think, are inexact criticisms. They underestimate the ability of France to transform itself, to right itself.’

Not so creditworthy: Standard & Poor poured humiliation on President Francois Hollande

But Michel Martinez, an economist at 
French bank Societe Generale, said the ratings downgrade ‘is another 
reminder of France’s challenges’.

Julien Manceaux, an economist at Dutch banking group ING, said: ‘This comes as another wake-up call to the French government.’

The
downgrade – which could push up French borrowing costs as investors 
worry about the  country’s credit-worthiness – came less than two years 
after France was stripped of its AAA rating.

It also sparked fears of fresh turmoil across the eurozone.

In
a further blow to Mr Hollande, official figures showed industrial 
output unexpectedly fell in September while the country’s trade deficit 
with the rest of the world worsened.

The
bleak data suggested that the French economy ground to a halt in the 
third quarter of the year after a brief recovery in the second quarter.

S&P says it expects unemployment in France to remain above 10 per cent until 2016 and to see net government debt to peak at 86 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015

Analysts
at Goldman Sachs estimate that the economy shrank by 0.1 per cent 
between July and September, leaving France on the verge of another 
recession.

It made grim 
reading for Mr Hollande who has failed to revive the eurozone’s second 
largest economy and seen his approval ratings plummet since his election
in 2012.

The European 
Central Bank this week cut interest rates in the eurozone from 0.5 per 
cent to a record low of 0.25 per cent as it stepped up its fight against
sluggish growth in the region and the threat of deflation.

It
came just days after the European Commission predicted that Britain 
will be the best performing major economy in Europe in 2013, 2014 and 
2015 – outstripping the eurozone big four of Germany, France, Italy and 
Spain.

S&P warned 
that the modest reforms Mr Hollande has implemented ‘will not 
substantially raise France’s medium-term growth prospects’.

It
blamed ‘successive government’ moves to increase already-high tax 
levels and ‘the government’s inability to significantly reduce total 
government spending’.

French
unemployment hit a record high of 11.1 per cent or 3.3million in 
September and more than a quarter of under-25s cannot find work.
