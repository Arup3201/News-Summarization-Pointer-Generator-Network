Exeter midfielder Matt Grimes is poised to undergo a medical with Swansea on Wednesday after the clubs agreed a £1.75million transfer fee.

Swansea moved quickly to head off interest from other Premier League clubs who were holding off bids until the summer.

Everton, Liverpool and Sunderland had also checked on the 19-year-old who is set to sign a four-and-a-half year deal at the Liberty Stadium. 

Matt Grimes will undergo a medical at Swansea on Wednesday ahead of £1.75million move

Grimes, 19, had been attracting interest from Premier League clubs Liverpool, Everton and Sunderland

But Swansea have stolen a march on their rivals and moved for the midfielder now instead of the summer

He has come through Exeter’s youth ranks and has been earning rave reviews winning the club’s Player of the Year trophy.

Exeter had hoped to sell Grimes and have him back on loan, but Swansea boss Garry Monk is keen to see if he can make a contribution to Swansea’s first team.

He will become Swansea’s second signing of the January transfer window following the arrival of Nelson Oliveira on loan from Benfica.
