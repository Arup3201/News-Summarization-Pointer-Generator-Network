Tony Blair was heckled by protesters who branded him a 'war criminal' as he gave a graduation speech at an American college.

The former British prime minister, 59, had to break off his his address as he spoke to 400 graduates and their guests at Colby College, in Maine.

Protesters shouted phrases such as 'warmonger' and 'You're a war criminal' during his speech. One person was arrested.

In his address, Blair appealed for international cooperation and for people to try to understand other cultures.

The former premier, who served from 1997 to 2007, backed the U.S. in it so-called war on terror and took Britain to war in Afghanistan and Iraq.

His decision to send troops to topple Saddam Hussein prompted widespread criticism, including a massive anti-war march in London which attracted more than one million demonstrators.

But, while he has long been dogged by demonstrations in Britain carrying out stunts like trying to arrest him, it is the first time his appearances in the U.S. have been hijacked by protesters.

In the States, where initial opposition to the Iraq war was much smaller, Blair had long garnered widespread respect as a dynamic leader who stood by America.

Furthermore, Americans usually focus their ire on George W Bush and prefer to see Blair as a man misled by the former president than someone who may have sought to deceive others.

Anger at Blair stems from the fact his Labour government sold the case for war on a so-called 'dodgy' dossier based on false information claiming Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.

Much of it was found to be plagarised from a PhD thesis and many protesters claim Blair knew its contentions - such as that Iraq could deploy chemical warheads within 45 minutes - were lies.

He and his wife, Cherie, had three children when he entered office. She gave birth to another son, Leo, in 2000 - the first baby born to a serving PM in more than 150 years.

Since leaving office he has made a multimillion pound fortune out of corporate consultancy and on the international speaking circuit.

He has also taken up a role as official Middle East envoy of the Quartet and, in 2008, launched his Tony Blair Faith Foundation.
