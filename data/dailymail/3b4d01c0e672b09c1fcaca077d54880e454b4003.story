Teenagers are usually renowned for spending their parents' money but one 13-year-old from Perth, Scotland, is on a penny-pinching mission to save her family cash.

C'Jai Hamilton, 13, describes herself as an 'extreme couponer' as she loves nothing better than bargain hunting to save her friends and family money.

The schoolgirl spends two hours a day on her endeavours, trawling websites for the best deals and checking every page of magazines and newspapers for discount coupons.

The teenager, pictured on the ITV show with her mother, Gail, has saved her parents £1,000 so far

Explaining how money-saving became a hobby, C'Jai said on today's This Morning: 'I kept seeing offers online and I kept looking into it and found it really interested me. I was able to get extra things for me and others which gave me a buzz and I liked helping people.'

Thanks to her efforts, C'Jai has saved her parents £1,000 so far as their weekly shopping bills have fallen by a quarter.

C'Jai's father suffers from severe arthritis and her mother, Gail, 37, is his full-time carer so the teenager wanted to do something to help them as money was tight. 

Appearing on the ITV show with her daughter, Gail said: 'Some months we live from week to week. If we can get a bit extra by saving money on the shopping then we can have a treat or a day trip.

'Every week C'Jai isn't just getting coupons for food products but cosmetics and pet products.'

C'Jai told Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford that bargain hunting is time consuming but worth it

C'Jai, who gives most of the products she gets at a discount to family and friends, said the trick to saving money is all in the research and avoiding impulse buying.

She said: 'You have to go on internet, that's big part of it, do online research. Make sure before you buy, it's for you - don't go for an offer if you don't need it as then you could save 20p for something else.'

She added: 'Look through every page of a magazine or a newspaper for coupons - don't buy a magazine if it doesn't have any coupons.'

The teenager trawls through magazines and websites every day to find money-saving offers

The schoolgirl said the only downside of her bargain hunting is she gets a lot of spam after signing up for discount deals with websites - so she has created an separate email address to the one she uses for social purposes. 

C'Jai said her hobby - always done after her homework - is time consuming but is is worth it for the rewards. 

Speaking about her love of couponing on her blog, C'Jai writes: 'If you're American you might think "this isn't much of a big thing because we do it all the time here", whereas in the UK it's really not, it's sadly not popular and we don't really get coupons a lot here in magazines or newspapers.

'If you're confused, it's also known as vouchers or money off, I really enjoy doing it and saving my family money, it helps money stretch a wee bit further and sometimes gets you that extra wee treat!

'It's well worth it, it's sometimes easy and hard, I wouldn't say it's a run in the park though... but it's something I really enjoy!'

Her mother compared her coupon hunting to a part-time job but said she's happy to encourage it because 'she's gaining skills that she can take into a job in the future.'

She added that her daughter is an asset when they go supermarket shopping as she's always looking for the best deals.

Gail said: 'Before I buy something she always makes me check if there's a better deal first and always questions if we need it. She says if we don't then it's not worth spending money on it.' 

To be a savvy shopper, C'Jai recommends looking for the best deals in supermarkets and avoid impulse buys
