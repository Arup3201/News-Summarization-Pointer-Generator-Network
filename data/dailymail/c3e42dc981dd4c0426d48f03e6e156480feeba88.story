Fabian Delph believes Aston Villa are capable of inflicting another shock defeat on Chelsea despite a run of 10 hours and 12 minutes without a Premier League goal.

Villa stunned Jose Mourinho’s side 11 months ago when Delph scored a late winner in an acrimonious game which effectively ended Chelsea’s title aspirations. Chelsea players Willian and Ramires, and Mourinho himself, were sent off and the Chelsea manager was fined for confronting referee Chris Foy.

Delph’s goal, a deft back-heel, boosted Villa’s survival ambitions. Paul Lambert’s team need similar help now — they lie three points above the relegation zone in 16th having not won in eight matches — but England midfielder Delph said: ‘I have been looking at that fixture, it is always nice when you play against the big boys.

‘It was a great night for me and the team — a much-needed three points when nobody gave us a chance of winning. If I could do it again it would be fantastic. Anything is possible in football, you could have 85 minutes under the cosh and then nick a goal.’

He added: ‘It does seem to be physical every time we play those teams. You are not allowed to tackle as much these days but it should be an entertaining game, they have some great players. It will be a tough night’s work.’

Villa’s excruciating run without a goal goes back to December 20, and Delph is aware that he has yet to score this campaign.

‘I have always worked on my finishing,’ he said. ‘It is about getting in the right positions to have those opportunities to have a strike on goal.

‘I am pretty confident I will get one or two this season and looking forward I would like to think I can add seven or eight goals a season. That is my target.’
