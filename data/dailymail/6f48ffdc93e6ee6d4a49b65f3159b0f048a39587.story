Sir Alex Ferguson has revealed it took him just 10 seconds to turn down the England job.

The former Manchester United manager was approached twice 
by the Football Association to take over the national side, first in 1999 
prior to the appointment of Kevin Keegan and then in 2001 before Sven 
Goran Eriksson was given the job.

And, speaking at the launch of his new book, My Autobiography, Ferguson admitted he didn't have to think twice before rejecting the opportunity.

'It was my great opportunity in life to relegate them,' he said. 'There was no way I could have taken the job. Adam Crozier was the first one to come. We met at Old Trafford and he made an offer.

'It didn’t take me long [to turn it down] – 10 seconds. I thought about it for 10 seconds. Never in a million years could I manage England. Think of me going back to Scotland. Dearie me.'

In his book, Ferguson also described the job as a 'bed of nails.'

He went on to admit he expects an immediate response from Roy Keane after claiming the former Old Trafford captain's personality changed towards the end of his time at the club.

He wrote of the ‘relief’ that was felt in the dressing room when the man with ‘the most savage tongue’ left the club in a blaze of controversy in 2005 after his dominance in the midfield began to wane.

The final straw, however, was Keane’s explosive interview on the club’s official channel, MUTV, in November 2005.

And Ferguson is now braced for the Irishman's comeback.

'The nature of the man you can expect that,' he said at his launch. 'That is the type of personality Roy is. The reason I had to explain it: it happened so quick, his actions were so quick. For one reason or another he decided to criticise his own team-mates. We couldn’t release the video.

'Two of our young players got booed at a match and we decided we had to do something. I couldn’t lose my control in his particular situation. If I had of let it pass the players would have viewed me differently. Throughout my career I’ve been strong enough.

'Roy overstepped his mark and there was no other thing we could do. We did well by him, paid up his contract, gave him a testimonial in front of 75,000 people. We did everything to honour the player he was for Manchester United.'

Ferguson, who was speaking in central London, also expanded on his 
relationship with David Beckham, claiming the former England captain 
changed after he met his future wife Victoria.

'The
 big problem for me, I’m a football man, he fell in love with Victoria –
 that changed everything. Being a football man, I had to think about 
where we were going for that,' he added.

'If he had asked my advice when he left 
Real Madrid for LA Galaxy I would have told him exactly what I thought. 
How can you leave Real Madrid for LA Galaxy?

'He reinvented himself a 
couple of times to go to AC Milan then PSG. That’s because of his 
natural stamina. At the end I think he did miss the big time football. 
Maybe in a couple of years he’ll look back and think that. I don’t think
 I’ve been critical of David Beckham.

'How can I argue with how he’s 
turned out as a human being? I thought he was a marvellous guy. When he 
joined us at 12 years of age he had this fantastic ambition to be a 
footballer. I loved that. It was a wonderful period for Man United.

'He 
worked to the point where he became a great player. We made the right 
decision to let him go to Real Madrid – we felt it was the right time.'
