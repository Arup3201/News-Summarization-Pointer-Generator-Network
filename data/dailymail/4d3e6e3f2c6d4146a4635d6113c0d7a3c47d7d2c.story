Outbursts of erratic and antisocial behavior continue to stack up against Shia LaBeouf.

A new video has surfaced showing the troubled actor almost getting into a fight outside a New York strip club, just one week before his arrest at a Broadway show last week.

TMZ posted the clip to their website on Sunday night, showing the 28-year-old bouncing around a sidewalk in front of another man.

More bizarre behaviour: Shia LaBeouf, centre, red shirt, haranguing a man outside a New York strip club

TMZ posted the clip to their website on Sunday night, showing the 28-year-old bouncing around a sidewalk in front of another man. It was apparently filmed just a week before the actor had a meltdown in a theatre

The Transformers star appears to be heckling the unidentified male, bouncing from toe to toe in the manner of a boxer waiting to clash with his opponent.

The 
footage comes just one day after the site revealed LaBeouf had been 
banned from a California restaurant after he was allegedly caught 
urinating on a wall out front.

LaBeouf's erratic behaviour has sparked concerns for his mental health in recent months.

Back in May, the actor visited the The Local Peasant in Sherman Oaks, where he stayed for over four hours.

The
 Nyphomaniac star 'meandered' his way to the back of the restaurant 
where he was followed by the manager into the parking lot.

Eyewitnesses told TMZ that the manager then called out Shia upon seeing him relieving himself against the wall.

He reportedly 'profusely apologized in an odd rant' and then went back inside the restaurant and attempted to order food.

According
 to the website, the manager told Shia to leave, they then exchanged 
some words before the actor stormed out 'vowing never to return.'

While the embattled star did pay his bill, the manager told TMZ Shia is 'officially persona non grata.'

Then,
 just hours before LaBeouf's Broadway spectacle, he was photographed 
chasing a homeless man around Midtown Manhattan, much to the shock of 
baffled bystanders.

He repeatedly said to the man: 'It's me, Shia.'

No big deal: He reportedly 'profusely apologized in an odd rant' and then went back inside the restaurant and attempted to order food before being banned for life

On 
Thursday, the 28-year-old was escorted out of the Broadway show in 
handcuffs for allegedly smoking, acting belligerent and slapping people 
on the behind during the performance.

The
 troubled actor was led away in tears from the Studio 54 theater on West
 54th Street around 9.30pm after causing a disturbance during the first 
act of Cabaret, which stars Michelle Williams and Alan Cumming.

LaBeouf screamed at the arresting officer: 'F*** you... this is f****** b******t... Do you know my life?'

He then added: 'Do you know who the f*** I am?', according to The Smoking Gun.

LaBeouf was charged with criminal trespass, harassment and disorderly conduct.

He was processed and released from a holding cell on Friday morning, an NYPD spokesman told MailOnline.

He is set to appear in court July 24.

Fooling around: LaBeouf posed with a fan before having his public meltdown

Earlier this year, LaBeouf stormed out
 of a 'Nymphomaniac' press conference in Berlin, before arriving on the 
red carpet for the film's German premiere wearing a paper bag on his 
head that read, 'I am not famous any more.'

He was also forced to apologise for alleged plagiarism and starred in his own silent art installation in Los Angeles.

Sadly, Shia LaBeouf's arrest for 
disorderly conduct at a Broadway theater on Thursday is just the latest 
incident in a string of erratic episodes for the former child star.

Bizarre behavior: LaBeouf arrived at the Nymphomaniac premiere in February wearing a brown paper bag

Earlier this year, the Transformers star
made headlines when he walked the red carpet at the Berlin Film 
Festival with a brown paper bag over his head.

Around the same time he declared he was 'retiring from public life because of attacks against his artistic integrity'.

In
January, LaBeouf got into a scuffle with a fellow drinker at the 
Hobgoblin pub in New Cross, South London, headbutting him apparently 
over remarks made about the mother of his girlfriend Mia Goth.

And last year, the actor famously quit the 
production of Broadway's ORPHANS then shared several confrontational emails 
between himself and fellow actors Alex Baldwin and Tom Sturridge, 
explaining why he pulled out of the show. 

In 2007, he was arrested for refusing to leave a Walgreens in Chicago but the criminal charges were later dropped.

In
February 2005, LaBeouf was arrested in Los Angeles and charged with 
assault with a deadly weapon for driving into his neighbor's car after 
losing his temper about having to wait to get into his garage. He then 
later turned up at his neighbor's door, allegedly waving a kitchen 
knife.
