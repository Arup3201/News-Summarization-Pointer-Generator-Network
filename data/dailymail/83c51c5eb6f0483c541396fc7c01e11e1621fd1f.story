Super Bowl-winning quarterback Russel Wilson is set to join the Texas Rangers for their spring training game against the Cleveland Indians today.

Texas Rangers number 3 jerseys emblazoned with Russell Wilson's name have gone on sale ahead of the stunt appearance by Wilson, who played minor league baseball in 2011.

But the star quarterback will not be risking injury by actually playing in the game, and instead will watch from the dugout.

The multi-talented sportsman was acquired by the Rangers during the 2013 Rule 5 draft from the Colorado Rockies.

The Rule 5 draft occurs each December. Teams can trade players not on their 40-man roster for $50,000 per player.

Wilson was drafted by the Colorado Rockies in 2010 and acquired by the Texas Rangers in December.

Seahawks fans need not worry; the Rangers are not about to put Wilson in Monday’s game and let him get buzzed by 90-mile-an-hour fastballs, even though he will be in uniform and in the dugout for the matchup with Cleveland.

His career with the team won't go beyond an appearance in the dugout at Monday's game in Surprise, Arizona where he's expected to inspire the Rangers before the match.

Wilson may take part in some of the Rangers’ pregame workout, but that is it.

'Our intentions are to bring him in and see if there’s anything he can say that may help anyone around here that has on a baseball uniform,' Rangers Manager Ron Washington said.

'This guy is a winner. He has tremendous character. He has attitude and undoubtedly has a lot of commitment to what he does.

'That’s what we’re about, and we just want him to feel comfortable.'

At one time, it appeared that Wilson’s best chance at being a professional athlete would come on the baseball field. Because of concerns about his height, the five-foot-11 Wilson jumped at his chance to play two seasons professionally in Colorado’s minor league system.

He played in 93 games in 2010 and 2011, but never above the Class A level.

The red and white jerseys are available at Texas Rangers shops in Arlington and Fort Worth and at the Surprise Stadium merchandise stores, reports ESPN.
