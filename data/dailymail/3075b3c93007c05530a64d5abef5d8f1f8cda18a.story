Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said firms were not operating in an ‘ethical manner’

Private firms which ripped off taxpayers to the tune of millions of pounds were handing their managers profit-related bonuses worth up to half their salaries, MPs have said.

Big businesses given public sector contracts were condemned by the Commons Public Accounts Committee for a culture of ‘profit-driven performance incentives’.

Such bonuses meant managers could be encouraged to manipulate performance data, the committee heard, which could allow them to falsely claim they reached targets, for example.

Last year Serco and G4S were exposed for overcharging the Ministry of Justice by tens of millions of pounds for electronic tagging of criminals, including some who were dead, in jail or had left the country. Both have since agreed to repay vast sums.

Written evidence provided by G4S showed the most senior managers’ bonuses could be up to half their salary. Up to 40 per cent of the sum was related to profits extracted from the contract and 20 per cent from growth.

Other managers could receive bonuses of up to a quarter of their salary. Up to half of that bonus was linked to the profits extracted from the contracts. 

Details of Serco performance bonuses were not handed to the committee.

Its report exposed how the firms continued to be awarded Whitehall work even while under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. 

The MPs said this showed the ‘dependence’ of Whitehall departments on the major outsourcing companies. 

As a result of overcharging, G4S has agreed to pay back £109million to the public purse and Serco almost £70million.

The most senior civil servant at the Ministry of Justice, Dame Ursula Brennan, told the committee there was now a ban on contracts containing bonus schemes which encouraged staff to manipulate data or ‘game the contract’.

Margaret Hodge, the committee’s chairman said outsourcing firms were not operating in an ‘ethical manner’, adding: ‘The legitimate pursuit of profit does not justify the illegitimate failure to conduct the business in an ethical manner.

‘A culture of revenue and profit driven performance incentives has too often been misaligned with the needs of the public who fund and depend on these services.

‘Departments have … placed too much trust in contractors and relied too much on the information contractors supply.’

The report found the Government was over-reliant on a small number of contractors to provide around £90billion of public spending – half of all its expenditure on goods and services.     

That amounts to half of all government spending on goods and services.

Poor contract management left taxpayers paying ‘outdated costs’ and firms making ‘excessive profits’, the report added. 

The report said ministers created the impression that all business with the firms had been suspended after the tagging scandal emerged.

But in reality, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Defence the Department of Health, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and HM Revenue & Customs all continued to award them more work while fraud investigations were going on.

Two other G4S contracts with the Ministry of Justice have been referred for investigations and a Serco contract is being probed by the City of London Police.

Serco’s was also found to have altered performance data on a contract for out-of-hours GP services in Cornwall.

The Ministry of Justice said bonus schemes for contractors which encouraged them to game the contract would not be permitted in future.
