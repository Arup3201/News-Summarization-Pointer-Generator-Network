Encouraged by her family, 14-year-old Astra Woodcraft signed up to one billion years of service to the Church of Scientology's Sea Organisation and set in motion a shattering series of events that led to her clandestine escape from the secretive religion.

Suffering sexual and physical abuse at the hands of fellow members, when Astra was 19 she resolved to leave the Church the only way she knew how - by secretly becoming pregnant, which went against the rules of the authoritarian Sea Org.

Pressured to have an abortion, she fled to relatives in England, leaving behind the 26-year-old husband she had married at 15, her mother, who she has spoken to only once since and a brother who has disowned her.

That was in 1998 and in the 14-years 
since her escape she has raised the daughter the church didn't want and 
chosen to act as an outspoken critic of Scientology.

'I was miserable, and it seemed like there was no other way out,' Astra told the Daily News about the Sea Org which has approximately 5,000 members across the world.

'If you simply said you wanted to leave, you had to go through a horrible year-long process.

'At the end, you still might be labeled suppressive and cut off from everyone you know.'

Originally
born in England, where she grew up for the first seven years of her 
life, Astra, her father, mother, grandmother, sister and brother moved 
to Clearwater, Florida where the family enthusiastically worked in the 
church.

'After our cozy existence in England, life among the Scientologists in Florida seemed sterile and confining,' said Astra to Glamour Magazine in 2005

'I saw my mother only about twice a week and when I did, she asked me not to call her Mom in front of others.

'Because Scientologists put more importance on titles than on gender, everyone addressed her as 'Sir'.

'To console myself for not having my mother, I made up a little chant, 'I wish I was back in England, I wish I was back in England.

Two years later, Astra's mother Leslie was advanced enough in her Scientology career to move to Los Angeles where she placed her girl in a Cadet Org school, which is a learning arm of the Sea Organisation.

'I learned the basics of reading, writing, and math, but had no classes in subjects like history or geography,' said Astra to The Daily Beast

'After school, I worked for hours in the basement of the Sea Org offices, filing papers and doing other organizational tasks. 

'I often stayed there overnight with my fellow students, sleeping on cots.

'I complained to my father, and he got me into a different school, also run by Scientologists.

'There was no real curriculum; our teacher spent hours reading to us from L. Ron Hubbard's science-fiction book Battlefield Earth.

The children were kept together in a dirty compound and dressed in old, torn clothes. They often went to school with head lice.

'There was always a looming threat of hard labor for those who seriously misbehaved,' said Astra.

'At night we drank a beverage we called 'CalMag,' a terrible mixture of calcium, magnesium, vinegar, and water.

'It was supposed to calm us down. I'm 33 years old now and can taste it still when I think of it.'

Around the time that Astra was 12, her father Lawrence left her mother after becoming dissatisfied at the route their lives were going down.

Astra rebelled.

'I'd look longingly at the public-school kids walking to class,' said Astra.

'But at the same time, I feared the outside world.

'I had been told that kids in public school are all on psychiatric drugs.'

For Astra Woodcraft, bringing up her daughter Kate outside of Scientology and the Sea Org meant losing contact with her mother, her husband and her brother

Deciding to commit herself to the Sea Org after some soul searching, Astra attended a two week camp called the Estates Project Force where she signed the infamous one-billion-year contract.

'People often married young within the Sea Org, as premarital sex was forbidden,' explained Astra.

'I chose a husband at age 15, a 22-year-old named Jason Merrill.

'I was attracted to him and we had known each other for some time; we married in Las Vegas, with parental consent and a signed order from a judge, as I was underage.

'We eventually settled into a small room at a Sea Org compound, and I accepted my fate—for the most part.

'Sometimes, I would sneak away at from bed at night and visit my father, and remember that outside world.

However, once an official member of the Sea Org, events started to spiral for Astra, leaving her to doubt her life in the church.

'One of my first jobs as an official member of the Sea Org was in the security department, meaning I had to make sure people obeyed church rules and ethics,' said Astra to the Daily Beast.

'It seemed that people were always in some kind of trouble—the place felt ruled by fear.

'Another thing you could get in trouble for: masturbation.

'Early on in my new job, I had to sit down with a man in his 40s who had admitted to masturbating, and tell him to cut it out. I was 15 years old.'

Around this time, Astra would sleep with a rope attached to her arm so that that any fellow church members in the same room who tried to escape would be caught.

Astra claims that she was prohibited from speaking to her father and that a former teacher put his hand down her blouse to feel her breast.

Furthermore, Astra alleges that one security officer with the church pushed her against a wall, put his hands on her neck while he screamed and spat in her face.

'A turning point came when I was 17. For reasons I do not know—perhaps money-related—members of the Sea Org were suddenly advised not to have children,' said Astra.

'We were told that a pregnant woman would be turned out of the organization.

Resolving to become secretly pregnant, Astra eventually made to escape the Sea Org and fly to England, but not before she was tracked down to the airport before she flew by her brother and other Scientologists.

'As I got near the security line, I thought with a relief, I've made it,' said Astra.

'Then I heard a familiar voice call, 'Astra'.

'My heart stopped. It was my older brother, Matt and another man I knew.

'Like me they were both members of the Sea Org.

'I assumed they were there for only one reason: to keep me from running away.'

Having ran away from her husband by pretending to do laundry, Astra was now faced with her brother determined to bring her back home.

'I felt a searing pang of fear—and guilt. I didn’t want to get Matt and my mother in trouble for my escape, but I had to go,' said Astra.

'I ran from him and made it to the plane.'

Even when she had made it to the relative freedom of England, Astra was conflicted by her emotions, having known nothing but the Sea Org and Scientology for her entire life.

'I didn’t want to be viewed as a negative 'suppressive person' who had left the church without following procedure, abandoning my family,' said Astra.

'So, two months later, I went back to Los Angeles to go through an official 'routing out' procedure. 

'Essentially, this meant confessing all my bad deeds over and over again, and eventually signing a document saying I had had a wonderful experience in the Sea Org.'

Filing for divorce from her husband 
whom she has not seen since she left the church, Astra gave birth to her
daughter Kate in September of 1998.

'I
remember being amazed in those early days by the most simple of 
freedoms, like riding my bike around a nearby park,' said Astra.

'I felt so free. Even a trip to the grocery store made me happy—I could buy whatever food I wanted.

'I
began working with my father in his architecture firm, and he literally
saved me, offering his full support and helping me realize what an 
oppressive environment I had been in.'

In the 14-years since her escape, Astra has become a successful architect and her daughter has just finished middle school.

In the late 1990's she received a $89,000 bill from the Sea Org for the education and lodgings she had received when a member but refused to pay.

'I saw my mother two years ago, for the first time in a decade,' said Astra.

'Her sister, my aunt, had arranged the meeting, in the hopes that we could work things out.

'I can only describe seeing my mother after all those years as a strange and sad experience.

'She said she wanted to have a relationship with me, but that I needed to respect her beliefs.

'I said I could do that. I also said I wouldn’t stop talking publicly about my experience within the church.

'I have not heard from her since.'
