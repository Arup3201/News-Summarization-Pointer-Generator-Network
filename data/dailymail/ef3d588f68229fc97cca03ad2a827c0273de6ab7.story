A copy of the letter which was sent be Dennis Giemsch seeking the addresses of  Jews in town

A neo-Nazi party has demanded to know where all Jews in the city of Dortmund live in a chilling echo of the build-up to the Holocaust.

Die Rechte – The Right – wrote to mayor Ullrich Sierau through one of its councillors, Dennis Giemsch, seeking to know how many Jews live in and around the town, and their addresses.

He asked that the information be supplied at a meeting of the council in the town hall on Wednesday night. 

The demand was refused and the letter has been passed to the interior ministry of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, which is looking at ways to legally ban the party.

Full-time computer student Giemsch said the information was 'relevant for our political work'. Die Rechte is the smallest of the far-right groups in the country but its numbers are growing, particularly among the young. 

The echoes of the terror that was unleashed on Jews after Hitler came to power in 1933 is not lost on Jews everywhere in Germany because the Holocaust of six million began with their registration, their numbers and where they lived.

Die Rechte has been under the watchful eye of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the domestic intelligence service, since it was founded two years ago from the rump of an old neo-Nazi party. 

It is the smallest of the far-right groups in the country but its numbers are growing, particularly among the young.

In the party programme it swears to protect the 'German identity,' ban English words in advertising, 'protect' German culture, limit immigration, kick out foreigners convicted of crimes, support 'German' families to have 'German' children, widen police powers of arrest and protect animals. 

Most of their manifesto can be found in a similar form from that of Hitler's National Socialists back in the 1920's.

Jewish people in Dortmund have reacted with alarm to the demand of the party to know where they reside and how many of them there are. 

One told a local newspaper: 'This is how it all began before. I don't think it will come to that again but such things evoke terrible memories. I hope this will be used by the authorities as a building block in future legislation to ban them.'
