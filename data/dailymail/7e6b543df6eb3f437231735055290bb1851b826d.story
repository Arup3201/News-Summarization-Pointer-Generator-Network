Fresh from completing his 1,000th career win against Milos Raonic in the final of the Brisbane International on Sunday, Roger Federer continued his warm up ahead of the Australian Open in Melbourne next Monday with a practice game against old foe Lleyton Hewitt.

But this was not your average court match on clay or grass.

The duo engaged in a game on the forecourt of the iconic Sydney Opera House before taking to speedboats for a high-octane encounter in the city's harbour.

Federer was in high spirits after achieving his landmark against Raonic. The Swiss star is now third in the all-time winners list behind Ivan Lendl (1,071) and Jimmy Connors (1,253).

The bizarre encounter was the curtain raiser to Federer and Hewitt's Fast 4 Exhibition match in Sydney as both players continued their preparations for the big tournament next week.

Federer will be looking to go one better at this year's Australian Open after he lost to Rafael Nadal in the 2014 semi-final with the Spaniard falling to Stanislas Wawrinka in the tournament's finale. 

This wasn't the first time Federer has played his sport in strange locations. The world No 2 played Nadal on a specially made floating court in in Qatar in 2011.

Federer also played Andre Agassi in an exhibition match on the helipad of the Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai in 2005; a full 700ft off the ground!
