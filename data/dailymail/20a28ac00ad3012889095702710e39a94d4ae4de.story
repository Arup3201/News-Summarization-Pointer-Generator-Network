Subway riders will be subjected to the release of gasses into the subway system today - by the NYPD.

The NYPD and researchers from Brookhaven National Laboratory have installed testing devices and will release the gasses - which are completely harmless - in an effort to test of how they spread through the subway system.

Officials have long noted that New York's subway system and its five million daily passengers are vulnerable, and this experiment will help experts understand how chemical, biological or radiological weapons could be used in the subway in a terrorist attack.

The police will use the information gathered in the tests to hone their plans for emergency responses to such attacks.

NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly said in a statement that about 200 sampling 
devices will be set up to take measurements.

The small black-and-gray boxes containing 
monitoring equipment have been installed on subway platforms and lamp 
posts poles around Manhattan.

The first part of the study began today at 8am.

The gasses are harmless perfluorocarbons, released at low levels at several subway stations and at street level for about half-an-hour during the morning.

The study is being funded through a $3.4 million grant from the federal Department of Homeland Security

'The NYPD works for the best, but plans for the worst when it comes to potentially catastrophic attacks such as ones employing radiological contaminant or weaponized anthrax,' Ray Kelly said.

'This field study with Brookhaven's outstanding expertise will help prepare and safeguard the city's population in the event of an attack.'

Paul Kalb, division head for environmental research and technology in the environmental sciences department at Brookhaven National Laboratory, told The New York Times that the study will help researchers to understand how the subway system affects the flow of air above and below ground.

'The subways play a major role in how air moves through Manhattan and the five boroughs,' Kalb told the Times.

Threatened: After the terrorist attacks in London in 2005, New York City upped its security on the transport system and this latest test is part of the NYPD's efforts to prepare

'[Gasses] can spread further and in a way that you might not anticipate,' he said, adding that the tests will help the NYPD decide which subway lines to close down in the event of an attack to limit the spread of contaminated air.

The traceable gases will be released in seven different locations in Manhattan - three above ground and four below - on three nonconsecutive days this month.

According to DNAinfo, today's testing will conclude at 3:30pm. The other two testing days are yet to be announced, and are dependent on weather.
