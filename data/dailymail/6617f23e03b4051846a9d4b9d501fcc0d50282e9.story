A controversial policeman who fatally shot a grandfather holding his nine-month-old baby earlier this week has now been involved in six deadly shootings across one city over the past decade.

All five previous killings which involved James Peters, of Scottsdale, Arizona, were ruled justifiable by prosecutors, as was a shooting in which the victim survived - and one even earned him a medal.

Now, after the latest killing, which saw John Loxas, 50, cut down by a single rifle shot to the head on Tuesday while holding the baby, authorities are again scrutinising the 12-year police veteran.

‘It's not a normal amount of officer-involved shootings. It's an anomaly in our department and in most departments,’ said Sergeant Mark Clark, a spokesman for the 435-officer force in Scottsdale.

With its year-round sunshine, the Phoenix suburb has become a magnet for professionals, retirees and winter tourists, and is known for its fine resorts, golf courses and expensive second homes.

The city of almost 220,000 people is considered one of the safest cities in metropolitan Phoenix. But it also has a grittier side, and the latest shooting happened in the working-class south end of the city.

Officer Peters, whom police would not allow to be interviewed, was among six officers called to Mr Loxas’s home after a neighbour told 911 he was holding the baby and threatening them with a gun.

Shooting: Officer Peters fired his scope-equipped police rifle as John Loxas leaned over and reached back into his Scottsdale house, authorities said. The grandchild was not hurt and police said he was trying to save its life

The policemen were getting ready to go 
into the run-down, trash-strewn home and get the baby when Mr Loxas 
opened the front door, still holding the child, and refused to come out,
 police said.

Officer Peters fired his scope-equipped police rifle as Mr Loxas leaned over and reached back into the house, 
authorities said. The baby was not hurt and police said Officer Peters was trying to
 save its life.

Mr Loxas wasn’t armed when shot, but the loaded handgun he was allegedly brandishing earlier was found tucked into a couch feet away and a loaded shotgun was also discovered nearby, police said.

An Arizona Republic list confirmed by police said Officer Peters's first shooting was in 2002, when he was one of three SWAT officers who wounded a man during a standoff in a domestic violence case.

Between 2003 and 2010, he was involved
 in five fatal shootings. In some, he acted alone. In others, fellow 
officers also fired. The Maricopa County Attorney's Office ruled them 
all justifiable

Probe: Sergeant Mark Clark, a spokesman for the 435-officer force in Scottsdale, admitted that the number of fatal shootings by Officer Peters is 'an anomaly in our department and in most departments'

Officer Peters even received the 
department's medal of valour for killing a man who was holding a grocery
 store worker hostage at gunpoint. But police did a review of all of the
 shootings in 2010.

'Seven shootings is a hell of a lot'

Mike Rains, California lawyer

‘Nothing indicated there was any sort 
of issue with his training or assignments that would be causing this,’ 
Sergeant Clark said. ‘You take each individual case. His reaction was 
within policy.’

This time, the department will 
examine the same questions again, in an investigation the chief said 
will probably take weeks. The findings will then be turned over to the 
county attorney.

Mike Rains, of San Francisco, California is a lawyer who represented officers involved in hundreds of shootings in the past 30 years. He said any officer with so many shootings deserves extra scrutiny.

‘Seven shootings is a hell of a lot,’ Mr 
Rains said, arguing that Officer Peters is either very aggressive in 
taking calls that end up requiring him to shoot or he is quicker on the 
trigger than he should be.

Maria Haberfeld, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, New York, said the four shootings he was in as a member of the SWAT team should be taken out of the equation.

'Because of his background in SWAT, he would have a predisposition maybe, maybe, to use his gun in a more assertive manner than his colleagues'

Maria Haberfeld, criminal justice expert

This is because SWAT officers are the ones most likely to use deadly force. But the three remaining shootings are still higher than the average of a couple of times, Dr Haberfeld said.

‘Because of his background in SWAT, he would have a predisposition maybe, maybe, to use his gun in a more assertive manner than his colleagues,’ Dr Haberfeld added.

But she noted the shootings were ruled justified, suggesting he is ‘a true professional’. She added: ‘So I don't see so much the concern that the public should have or the department should have.’

The story of Officer Peters has been compared to the 1971 film Dirty Harry, starring Clint Eastwood as police inspector Harry Callahan - a San Francisco cop who has little regard for the rules.

Not everyone agrees that Officer Peters always acts appropriately. Jason Leonard, a lawyer in Fort Myers, Florida, represented the family of a man killed in 2006 by him and another officer.

He is worried the city backs Officer Peters even when his actions are questionable. ‘My concern is that he seems to shoot first and ask questions later and has been supported in this policy,’ he said.

‘I don't think he's going after innocent citizens,’ Mr Leonard added. ‘However, if you find yourself in a precarious situation, he seems to err on the side of escalating the violence.’

Kevin Hutchings got into a fight with a friend in August 2006, then left and drove to his house in nearby Mesa. Officers had the friend call Mr Hutchings at his house, and police went there, Mr Leonard said.

While Mr Hutchings was talking on the phone, police cut the power to flush him out. Mr Hutchings came outside with a gun to investigate. Police said he shot at officers and they shot back.

Mr Leonard said cops never announced their arrival. The family accepted a $75,000 city payout.
