A passenger on board a Sydney-bound Virgin Australia flight has been charged after his flight was forced to return to Perth.

Australian Federal Police (AFP) allege the 22-year-old Midland man abused fellow passengers and crew on flight VA564 on Wednesday night while under the influence of alcohol and other substances.

The captain decided to return the flight to Perth Airport, where the man was arrested by AFP officers.

He was charged with one count each of fail to follow direction from the crew and acting in a disorderly manner.

Virgin Australia said other passengers were either placed on the next Perth to Sydney flight, which departed at midnight (WST), or on another flight on Thursday.

'Guests that were away from their home port were provided overnight accommodation,' Virgin Australia said.

AFP acting airport police commander, Detective Superintendent Terry Nunn, said violent and disorderly behaviour onboard aircraft would not be tolerated.

'The cabin crew should not have to be abused, threatened, or interfered with while conducting their duties,' he said.

'This same standard also applies to fellow passengers, who did not deserve the inconvenience of their trips being cancelled or delayed.'

The man is scheduled to face Perth Magistrates Court on Thursday.
