A Filipino heroin smuggler’s final legal appeal is thought to be all that now stands between Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran’s execution date being set.

Indonesia's attorney general has insisted the executions of the two Bali Nine smugglers and other drug offenders are going ahead, even though he's decided to respect the pending legal processes of Filipino woman Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso.

She is the only one of the 10 convicts slated for the firing squad who is not yet on Nusakambangan prison island where the deaths  will take place.

The Supreme Court is considering her application for a second judicial review, and Co-ordinating Minister for Politics, Law and Security Tedjo Edhie Purdjiant on Monday said the decision would be sped up.

Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso is expected to be executed with Bali Nine members Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran of Australia and other drug smugglers from Brazil, France and Nigeria

'We'll wait. Maybe this week we will get a decision,' he told reporters, as quoted by Indonesian website okezone.

The Australians were moved from Bali to Nusakambangan - the island where the executions are set to take place - last week under heavy security.

Authorities wish to keep prisoners on the Central Java island for as little time as possible before their execution. They are required to give the condemned prisoners a minimum 72 hours notice of their pending deaths.

With the Bali Nine pair in place on the island, Jakarta unexpectedly shifted gear on Friday and said it would respect prisoners' ongoing legal processes.

On Monday, the duo received grim news when a Nigerian inmate on death row had his legal challenge rejected, offering poor prospects for their own appeal.

Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukmaran's fellow inmate - a Nigerian man - had his appeal rejected on Monday

Nigerian Jamiu Owolabi Abashin believes the prosecution case against him has been entirely based on his fake identity. He was arrested under his alias in 1998, smuggling 5.3 kilograms of heroin

Jamiu Owolabi Abashin had his appeal against clemency rejected on the grounds that the Administrative Court did not have jurisdiction over Joko Widodo's presidential decision.

Abashin and his lawyer, Utomo Karim, will appeal the latest decision and seek a judicial review on Wednesday on the basis that he committed his crime under the alias Raheem Agbaje Salami 17 years ago.

He was arrested under his alias in 1998, smuggling 5.3 kilograms of heroin but his fake identity was still used right through his arrest, conviction and clemency plea.

Attorney General HM Prasetyo told reporters in Jogjakarta on Monday it wasn't accurate to say the executions were delayed.

'I assure you there's no delay. I never said the date of execution,' he said, as quoted by Indonesian website kompas.com.

Myuran Sukumaran was transported to the Indonesian 'death island' by armed officers on Wednesday 

Andrew Chan - now an ordained minister - took a bible with him to his place of execution

But he corroborated his spokesman's comment from Friday that legal appeals were behind the delay in announcing an execution date.

'Right now, we have to fulfil their legal rights even though they have already requested clemency,' he said of the prisoners.

Mr Prasetyo said Indonesia still intended to execute the prisoners simultaneously, noting that a 'psychological burden' may be created if the prisoners went to the firing squad separately.

Chan and Sukumaran have an appeal in court on Thursday, and a French prisoner has one on Wednesday.

Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, were on Monday buoyed by their first visit from their families since moving into Nusakambangan.

The Sydney families will return on Wednesday during visiting hours. The men can receive consular and lawyers' visits on other days.

Frenchman Serge Areski is also facing the firing squad as well as Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia

Just after Indonesian president Joko Widodo had touched on the possible abolishment of the death penalty in an interview with Al Jazeera on Saturday, former Indonesian president Megawati Sukarnoputri reportedly told Widodo not to grant clemency.

In a speech she made on International Women's Day, she blamed drugs for the spread of HIV in Indonesia and said that drug use in the country had entered a critical state

Abashin is one of three Nigerians awaiting execution - the others being gospel singer Okwudili Ayontanze and Silvester Obiekwe who was caught running a drug racket from inside jail.

Prisoners facing the firing squad that are having their cases judicially reviewed are Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, Serge Areski Atlaoui and Zainal Abidin.

Brazilian man Rodrigo Gularte is also set to be put to death despite a diagnosis of schizophrenia.
