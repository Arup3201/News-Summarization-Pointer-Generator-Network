A murder investigation has been launched after a 17-year-old boy was found fatally stabbed in a north London street. 

Police and paramedics were called to Berkley Gardens in Enfield at about 9.35pm last night by a member of the public and found the teenager 'collapsed on the pavement'.

He was taken to a hospital in central London in a critical condition but died a short time later, Scotland Yard said.

A murder investigation has been launched after a 17-year-old boy was found fatally stabbed in a north London street, near the Berkley Gardens in Enfield; three teenagers and a 46-year-old woman are in custody

Four people, two boys and a girl aged 17, and a 46-year-old woman, have been arrested on suspicion of murder.

Police would not comment on how the group knew each other, whether they knew the deceased or the circumstances leading to the death.

The deceased's next of kin have been told about his death, but the teenager was yet to be formally identified, police said. 

A post mortem has not yet been scheduled, but may take place tomorrow. 

The suspects are being held at separate stations in north London as detectives from the homicide and major crime command continue to investigate.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the incident room on 020 8345 3775 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
