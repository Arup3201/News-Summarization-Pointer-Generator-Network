The widow of poisoned spy Alexander Litvinenko has said the 'whole world' will know the truth about what happened to her husband as a public inquiry was formally opened into his death today.

Marina Litvinenko told reporters outside the Royal Courts of Justice it was a 'special day', adding that she felt positive the inquiry would begin on schedule next January.

Earlier in the hearing, the inquiry's chair Sir Robert Owen praised the widow for her patience in the face of 'highly regrettable' delays.

Her husband, who fled to Britain in 2000, was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 while drinking tea with two Russian men, one a former KGB officer, at the Millennium Hotel in London’s Grosvenor Square in 2006.

After formally suspending the inquest into Mr Litvinenko’s death, Sir Robert opened the public inquiry.

He told the hearing that alleged Russian state responsibility in the 43-year-old’s death was of 'central importance to my investigation'.

Sir Robert explained that Britain’s responsibility for protecting the former KGB officer would not be investigated as there was no evidence to suggest any failings on the state’s part.

However, he added that if evidence was discovered during the course of the inquiry to suggest Britain could have prevented his death he was able to bring the issue into the scope of the process.

And Sir Robert explained that some of the inquiry would have to be kept secret and held in private. 

Progress: She added that she was 'confident' the inquiry will open on schedule next January 

Success: The public inquiry, which formally opened in London today, was announced when Ms Litvinenko challenged opposition from the Government and the Home Secretary in the High Court

Submission: Ms Litvinienko did admit that some parts of the inquiry will remain secret and she may never know the content of some of the evidence

He said: 'Because of the sensitivity of Her Majesty’s Government’s evidence it is inevitable that at least some of my final report will also have to remain secret but I make it clear now that I intend to make public my final conclusions on the issue of Russian state responsibility together with as much as possible of my reasoning in that regard.'

The Government had previously resisted launching a public inquiry, and instead said it would 'wait and see' what a judge-led inquest found.

But Ms Litvinenko challenged this and the High Court ruled that the Home Secretary must reconsider the decision.

An inquiry will allow investigators to probe whether the Russian state was behind the former KGB officer’s murder. 

Ms Litvinenko said the coroner had thanked her for her patience because of the amount of times the inquest had been delayed, but added: 'I believe genuinely 2015 it will start.'

She added: 'Everybody around the world will know the truth.' 

Asked if she thought last week’s announcement was due to the strained political situation with Russia, she said the 'political situation' may have contributed to it, but she did not think there had been any 'political involvement' in the process.

She added that she had always been aware parts of the inquiry would have to be in secret, and admitted she may never know the content of some of the evidence submitted to the inquiry.

But Ms Litvinenko said she was reassured it would be viewed by the chair and other lawyers.
