Merry revellers quickly turned into disgruntled commuters after Sydney's busiest train stations were closed when a fire alarm caused chaos as the night ticked over into 2015.

Tens of thousands of punters made their voices heard as they were forced to a complete standstill in the middle of George Street after they couldn't take their journey home via Wynard and Martin Place stations.

With about 1.6 million people attending the spectacular annual event - the timing of a fire alarm going off at central station could not have been worse on the city's most jam packed day of the year.

Martin Place Station resembles more of a cattle station as a fire alarm at Central station forces it to close

Weary punters were pushing, shoving and chanting as they tried to force their way into the stations. 

But it wasn't too long before the stations reopened and the droves of exhausted commuters were allowed in and travelled home to their much-needed beds.

Transport NSW tweeted that passengers were advised to allow additional time after staff were evacuated from the Sydney Signalling Complex at Central station earlier due to a fire alarm.

'Trains are running again but passengers should listen to announcements and check indicator boards at stations,' it said.

Tired commuters took to social media to vent their frustrations about the untimely debacle.

'Wow great new year spoilt by #sydneytrains crowd management. Massive crowds, empty trains, inefficient crowd management! Craig Badings posted.

Beau Giles compared the disaster to London's rail system. 

'Feels like I’m in a London Underground documentary. Martin Place station closed. Trains broken,' Mr Giles posted.

'Literally people are stranded in the CBD/North Sydney', another added.
