Tamara Ecclestone and her husband Jay Rutland are rumored to be 'having marital issues' over the fact that the 30-year-old Formula 1 heiress brings their ten-month-old daughter Sophia into their bedroom to sleep with them every night.

According to a source close to the couple, who have just returned from a sun-filled getaway in Dubai with their beloved daughter, Jay is threatening to move into the spare room of the couple's luxurious home in Kensington, West London because he is so fed up with the situation.

'Tamara is a bit too protective when it comes to their baby and Jay has insisted that she needs to get an expert to help sleep train Sophia,' the source revealed to MailOnline.

Sweet dreams: Tamara believes that ten-month-old Sophia is happiest when she can sleep with her parents

Proud parents: Both Tamara and Jay are devoted to their daughter and are said to be determined to come up with a solution to their co-sleeping issue that will benefit the whole family

'Tamara insists that Sophia will cry all night unless she's sleeping with her, but Jay has had enough.

'It is causing a fair amount of friction.'

A second source added: 'Tamara is incredibly protective of the baby and loves having her sleeping in her bed. Jay is slightly less tolerant of the situation.' 

A spokesperson for Tamara confirmed that she and Jay are still working out what is best for their baby, but added that both parents are determined to find the perfect situation that works for all of them - particularly their daughter.

'Like all new parents, Tamara and Jay are learning about the best ways to raise their baby,' the spokesperson told MailOnline. 'However they are committed to creating a happy, healthy future for their daughter.' 

But while the issue of co-sleeping has divided the otherwise loved-up couple, Tamara, who has own luxury hair care range, Show Beauty, is not alone when it comes to her opinions on where her daughter should sleep.

A host of other celebrity mothers, from Angelina Jolie and Gwen Stefani to Heidi Klum and Kourtney Kardashian, have all spoken out in favour of co-sleeping with their children.

In 2011, No Doubt frontwoman Gwen told Stylist that she regularly slept with her son Zuma, adding that she loved the extra hours it meant she got to spend with him. 

Loving father: Jay is an incredibly affectionate dad and loves spending time with his daughter, however he feels that Sophia should be sleeping in her own room 

Room for one more? Tamara often posts pictures of her daughter sleeping or playing in her parents' bed to her Instagram account

'I don’t want to look back and say, "Oh my God, I didn’t sleep with Zuma that time because I was too tired," so I’ll just snuggle up with him tonight,' she said. 'It’s probably why I work as hard as I do - I don’t want to look back and see the things I didn’t do.'

According to parenting expert Jo Tantum, many mothers find it hard to leave their babies in a separate room at night, particularly when the baby is having trouble sleeping, and tends to wake crying at regular intervals.

However, Jo warned that Tamara and Jay need to try and tackle the issue as soon as possible - or risk Sophia developing into an overly dependent toddler.

'It's really tough when you have a baby that doesn't sleep well,' she told MailOnline. 'And as the baby is ten months old then they really need to change things, otherwise they are going to have a dependent toddler, as they have set themselves up for being in demand 24/7.'

Jo suggested that the devoted parents start to implement a few smaller changes in their day-to-day routine, before trying to sleep separately from Sophia, in order to make their daughter feel as happy and comfortable as possible.

'They need to get the baby into a flexible, natural routine,' she added. 'At ten months a baby would naturally need a nap every two and a half hours, and they would be having between two and three milk feeds and three meals a day.

'At ten months they wouldn't need a feed in the night. 

'[Tamara] still needs to nurture her baby, [give her] cuddles and meet her baby's needs.The issue is that if she is still having their baby in the bed, this can really take its toll on relationships, and Dad gets relegated to the spare room.

'[That] should send warning bells that maybe things should change. And she can still nature her baby [without needing to sleep with her].'

And while some might accuse Jay of being insensitive to the needs of his wife and daughter, Jo insists that issues like this can be especially hard on the fathers.

'I think it's really tough for Dads, especially if it's been ten months of sharing their bed,' she said. 

'He still needs to feel part of a family rather than it being mummy and baby and then him.

'He would need to support her to make the changes - she still needs help to feed the baby and help to get the baby to sleep - but in in separate space.'
