An ex-Army officer who pocketed £36,000 in disability handouts after claiming he could barely walk was caught playing golf with his old comrades.

Eric Roper, 64, from Liverpool said he struggled to walk further than 20 yards and couldn't even climb a flight of stairs.

But following an anonymous tip-off, investigators from the Department of Work and Pensions secretly recorded him teeing off during a regimental reunion.

Officials who were hidden in the 
trees at a golf club saw Roper walk around the course without 
difficulty, playing out of bunkers and putting on the green. 

He subsequently came third in the King's Regiment Annual Golf Day out in Formby, Merseyside.

At
Liverpool Crown Court, Roper, of Mossley Hill, Liverpool, wept as he 
pleaded guilty to three offences of making false representation to 
obtain benefits over an eight year period.

He was given a suspended prison sentence after it emerged he had repaid £30,000.

Earlier
the court heard how Roper had served in the armed forces from a young 
age, spending nine years in the First Battalion and a further 15 in the 
Lancastrian Battalion before becoming a warrant officer in the King's 
Regiment of the Territorial Army.

After 
being made redundant in 2000 from his administration job, he suffered a 
heart attack and had to sign up for disability benefits - legitimate for
the first two years.

But when his condition improved in 
2002, instead of informing the DWP of his increased mobility and 
improved health, he told them on three separate occasions how his 
conditions kept him from walking more than 20 yards.

Prosecuting Miss Martine Snowdon said
'He made a claim for disability living allowance for a number of years 
on the basis he was incapable of work due to his illness.

'Roper said after his coronary artery 
bypass graft he suffered from unstable angina, back problems, 
osteoarthritis in his right shoulder, deafness, dizzy spells and 
breathlessness, among other symptoms.'

Miss Snowdon told how in June 2010, an anonymous tip-off triggered a DWP investigation into his claims, made in April 2004, April 2006 and June 2010.

She said: 'He was seen to be playing golf.

'Since 2002 he'd been a member of a golf club and had been seen to be playing without discomfort and walking further than he said he could.'

Following the investigation, he was questioned and admitted his crimes in interview, initially claiming to have been confused by the nature of the criteria but accepting responsibility for the deceit.

The total amount taken between October 2002 and 2010 was £36,241. 

Defending Miss Rebecca Blaine said the father-of-four was a man of previous good character who had made 'full and frank admissions' when questioned.

'He feels deep regret and he is deeply ashamed of his actions and of letting his family down. He is a man who from the very outset has been wholly remorseful.'

Ms Blaine said the proceedings had had a negative effect on his health and he had been invited to make further claims, albeit at a lower level than before.

Ms Blaine spoke of his contribution to society and told how he had repaid £30,000 of what he owed.

'He liquidated his life savings and sold the family vehicle and that's how he has been able to repay the money.

'This is not a man who lived a life of luxury.'

Judge David Swift recapped the details of the case and noted that for the first two years the claim had been legitimate before his condition improved. 

He told Roper: 'Over a period of six years you continued to receive the benefits notwithstanding that there had in fact been a significant improvement in your condition.

'The disability and mobility problems at that time were not legitimate problems, not as they had been in years gone past.'

Roper wept as he was told he would avoid prison with a four month custodial sentence suspended for 18 months, concurrent on each count and included an 8pm to 8am curfew. 

Speaking after court, DWP fraud manager Steve Sneade said: 'Benefit fraud is not a victimless crime. It's stealing money from the taxpayer, intended for the most vulnerable in our society and the message today is that if you commit benefit fraud you will be caught.'

DWP Minister for Welfare Reform, Lord Freud, said: 'It's cases like these that show us why welfare reform is needed.

'We have a duty to the taxpayer to make sure that these vital benefits only go to those who need them.'
