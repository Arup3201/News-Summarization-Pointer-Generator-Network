It's Hot or Not time again as Ian Ladyman reveals what's been making him feel warm this week and what's been leaving him cold inside. 

WHAT'S HOT 

SCOTT LAIRD

Preston's scorer against Manchester United still gets a pound from his gran every time he finds the target. A left-back with two goals so far this season, he can expect a letter from the Inland Revenue soon.

LIZZY YARNOLD

A woman who revels in her own ordinariness, Yarnold knits and once played a tree in a school play. She is, however, an extraordinary athlete and this week attempts to add the World skeleton gold to her Olympic and recently acquired European titles. We wish her well.

MARK POUGATCH

In choosing their new Champions League host, ITV have finally worked it out. Quirky and offbeat works for midnight phone-ins and Olympic breakfasts but prime time sport requires experience, subtlety and authority. There is, after all, a reason David Coleman was so successful.

LEIGH HALFPENNY

There is something comfortingly familiar about the dull thud of the Welsh full-back's boot against a rugby ball. Or is that just me? Whatever the case, Halfpenny's place kicking is so good his percentage success rate in the mid-80s places him in the company of Jonny Wilkinson and the great Dan Carter.

WHAT'S NOT 

MO FARAH

There is no rulebook about how champions should behave but for the peculiar Farah there is a trusted creed located somewhere in Ancient Greece that could help. An Olympic champion calling an English rival's efforts on the track an 'embarrassment' is rather, well, embarrassing.

SKY CRICKET

With the broadcaster now throwing even more of its money at football, something has to give. Interesting, then, to see David Gower anchoring SKY's excellent World Cup coverage not from Sydney Harbour but a cupboard in Isleworth. 'There's a budget,' said Gower.

FOOTBALL LEGENDS

Using the past to sell the present is fine but surely there are boundaries. Manchester United's latest official 'legend' is Louis Saha, the French striker who made 86 league appearances. For context, that's 19 less than the human doughnut Anderson who recently left United without fanfare.

PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN

The French club took pre-match banter to new levels ahead of Tuesday's game by posting a Twitter mock-up of the Queen wearing a PSG scarf. A rather off-target gag, given that it applied to precisely 11.1% of the squad picked by coach Jose Mourinho.
