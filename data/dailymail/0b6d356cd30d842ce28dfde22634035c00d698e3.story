Five British jihadis killed by US air strikes may have been trainee al-Qaeda suicide bombers, according to intelligence agencies.

Those killed include 19-year-old Ibrahim Kamara, who quit his studies in Brighton to join militants in Syria.

It’s thought that they were fighting for the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front.

Kamara ‘met the wrong people’ and was quickly radicalised. He is said to have recently vowed to a fellow fighter he would never return to Britain

This wasn’t targeted by coalition planes, but a cell called Khorasan - hand-picked by Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and thought to be on the brink of attempting to blow up Western civilian airlines - was bombed.

Counter-terrorism police think that the two groups may have been working alongside each other and that the Britons were being drilled by Khorasan  to carry out suicide attacks on Western targets, according to The Times.

Kamara’s mother, Khadijah, 35, said that he had secretly travelled to the war-torn country and she felt ‘numb’ that he was dead.

The teenager, who called himself Khalil al-Britani, had recently completed a resit of his GCSEs at Varndean College in Brighton.

His single mother and her three other sons, who live in the Sussex city, are believed to be refugees from Sierra Leone who came to Britain via the Netherlands.

But football-loving Kamara ‘met the wrong people’ and was quickly radicalised. He is said to have recently vowed to a fellow fighter he would never return to Britain.

Mrs Kamara, who says she abhors violence, said she knew her son was likely to die when he rang her and confessed he was in Syria.

She said: ‘He called me in February. He said: “Mum, I’m in Syria”, and I hung up. He rang again and I said: “Don’t ever call me.” The first we heard about his death was when my younger son got a Facebook message from one of the boys he went out there with.

‘He sent a photo of Ibrahim dead and the message read “Congratulations, your brother has become a martyr”. My son told him to delete the picture but he refused.’

Mrs Kamara, manager of the Strive In The Way of Allah charity shop in Brighton, said of the 19-year-old: ‘He was a normal respectful boy. He had friends at school. He was studying IT and wanted to become an engineer.

‘He moved out recently but he had the spare key to my house and came round for dinner all the time.

‘I had no idea what he was planning. He must have been brainwashed. He went out there with three brothers from Brighton.

‘His passport was expired so he went up into my room and got the passport of his 15-year-old brother. It makes me wonder about the Border Control people because they look nothing like each other.’ 

The Foreign Office said it was aware of the reports of the dead Britons but could not confirm them at this stage.
