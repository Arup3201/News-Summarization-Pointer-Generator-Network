Neither Bruno Zuculini or Kelechi Iheanacho are fully-fledged Manchester City players just yet, but both were on the scoresheet as the Premier League champions got their US tour off to a winning start at Sporting Park.

Zuculini will officially join City once the Premier League ratify the Argentine’s £1.5million move from Racing Club, and highly-rated Nigerian striker Iheanacho can only loosely be referred to as a triallist after earning a place on the flight to America during last week’s training camp in Scotland.  

The teenager came through the Right to
 Dream programme in Ghana, which has close links with City, and starred 
in last summer’s Under-17 World Cup.

Dedryck
 Boyata and Aleksandar Kolarov were the other scorers as City eased to 
victory over the current Major League Soccer champions.

Most of 
Pellegrini’s star players were still missing but there was another 
outing for new signings Willy Caballero and Fernando as well as some who
 might not be at the club much longer, such as Micah Richards, Scott 
Sinclair, Matija Nastasic and Javi Garcia.

The
 banners that read ‘Kansas City Cauldron’ and ‘Welcome to the Blue Hell’
 made out as though City were about to face Galatasaray, not their 
friendly hosts from America’s mid-West.

In
 fact, the promise of a hot reception extended no further than the 
temperature which had topped 110 degrees on Tuesday and was still far 
from comfortable by the time the match kicked off on Wednesday evening 
after the obligatory national anthems, fireworks and, finally, a video 
of some of Sporting’s finest moments.

City
 made something of a mockery of the tub-thumping build-up when they 
opened the scoring after just two minutes, however. The ball fell kindly
 for Zuculini on the edge of the area and the Argentine applied a 
clinical finish by hooking a volley inside the post.

Iheanacho
 is an even more unfamiliar name to City fans and the Nigerian striker, 
wearing No 72, would have added a second but for a fingertip save from 
goalkeeper Andy Gruenebaum.

However,
 the current MLS champions and Eastern Conference leaders came into the 
match unbeaten in six games and were not about to roll over in front of 
their own fans.

CJ Sapong 
hit the bar moments after Zuculini’s opener and Dom Dwyer beat Caballero
 at the second attempt shortly afterwards only to see his effort ruled 
out for offside.

City’s luck
 ran out on the half hour mark, though, when they left Sapong unmarked 
and he had time to bring down Benny Feilhaber’s cross from the right and
 draw Caballero out of his goal before sliding home an equaliser.

City
 should have restored their lead in the 38th minute when Karim Rekik’s 
long ball set Stevan Jovetic free on goal but he dithered with only 
Gruenebaum to beat and Aurelien Collin, once of Wrexham and Gretna, got 
back to make a vital challenge.

The
 Premier League side were not to be denied though and grabbed a second 
on the stroke of half-time when Jesus Navas won a freekick which he 
swung in from the right for Boyata to power in a header from close 
range.

Kansas again 
threatened an equaliser in the second period – not least when Caballero 
produced a reflex save to keep out Michael Kafari’s effort – but City 
made sure of victory when Kafari brought down Sinclair and Kolarov
 comfortably converted from the spot before Iheanacho added a late 
fourth with a cool finish.
