A 98-year-old millionaire claims he and his wife were lured into paying $12 million to California's Chapman University then the school did not stick to their agreement.

Real estate mogul James Emmi accuses university president James Doti of putting undue pressure on him to sign a contract without the consent of his 84-year-old wife, Catherine.

In a suit that alleges breach of contract, fraud, deceit and elder abuse, Mr and Mrs Emmi, of Orange County, demand that the university return all $3 million of the donation already transferred, surrender their claim to the remaining $9 million, and pay $3 million in damages.

Demands: James and Catherine Emmi (seated) claimed Chapman University president James Doti (center) pressured Mr Emmi into signing a contract to donate $12 million to the school after 'wining and dining' him

'They really confused him and they pressured him,' said James Bohm, the Emmis' attorney, told The OC Register. 'They wined and dined him, and they took advantage of his advanced age.'

It comes after the university failed to mention the couple at a recent graduation event, instead thanking another donor who gifted $15 million, the LA Times reported.

Furthermore, the civil suit claims, the university was not on track to build The Emmi Science Center by 2016, which was stipulated in the contract.

According to court papers, Mr Emmi was continually hounded by university officials for donations after he gifted $450,000 toward a new science center in 2009.

The couple claim they rejected a request for $15 million toward a technology center in 2012.

In 2013, over tea, Mr Emmi is said to have consented to donate $12 million to the university's science center, on the grounds that it would be in his name.

'Undue pressure': Mr Emmi, 98, claims Mr Doti took advantage of his old age in a 2013 meeting over tea

'Broken promises': The couple claim the university was not on track to build a center by 2016 as promised 

The university promised full-scale media coverage of the gift and said it would be built by 2016, Mr Emmi states.

'Chapman University is deeply saddened by the misstatements in the complaint filed by the Emmis,' Chapman spokeswoman Mary Platt said in a statement.

'Mr. James Emmi has been a close friend of both President James Doti and the university. The allegations do not reflect what occurred and completely mischaracterize the Emmis' interactions with the university.'
