They created some of the world’s most loved masterpieces and melodies, as well as works of literature and scientific theories.

But what did the likes of Pablo Picasso and Charles Dickens do in their spare time and when did they create their masterpieces?

Now an infographic reveals the hobbies, day jobs and dining preferences of some of prolific inventors, thinkers, writers, artists and composers, showing the great minds don’t always think alike.

The chart, created by Florida-based online work platform Podio, is based on diary entries, letters and documents revealing the little details of people's lives.

It reveals that writers Honore de Balzac, Charles Dickens, Kingsley Amis and Franz Kafka all took regular naps, with Kafta - who is best known for The Metamorphosis - typically spending between 3pm and 7pm catching up on sleep, as he tended to work during the night.

The chart explains: 'Resting the mind helps generate novel ideas. At least 12 hours away from work is recommended, preferably involving some sleep.

'Naps can also boost the mind’s ability to solve creative problems.’

There IS a link between creative genius and madness - with both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder frequent in highly creative and intelligent people.

The idea was investigated by a panel of scientists who had all have some form of mental disorder.

Kay Redfield Jamison of John Hopkins school of Medicine, who suffers from bipolar disorder, said that intelligence tests on Swedish 16-year-olds had shown that highly intelligent children were most likely to go on to develop the disorder.

'They found that people who excelled when they were 16 years old were four times as likely to go on to develop bipolar disorder,' says Jamison.

Painter Van Gogh and author Jack Kerouac were both hailed as geniuses but displayed self-destructive behaviour.

What's less clear is why human beings might have evolved this trait.

'The notion of a ‘tortured genius’ or ‘mad scientist’ may be more than a romantic aberration,' according to experts at the World Science Fair.

'Research shows that bipolar disorder and schizophrenia correlate with high creativity and intelligence, raising tantalizing questions: What role does environment play in the path to mental illness?

Previous research has hinted that much of the 'link' is created by one particular gene, known as DARPP-32, which links genius with madness.

Three quarters of people inherit a version of the DARPP-32 gene, which enhances the brain's ability to think by improving information processing by the prefrontal cortex - the part of the brain that orchestrates thoughts and actions.

Contemporary author Haruki Murakami goes swimming - an activity he shares with fellow novelist Kurt Vonnegut on the chart, whereas Victor Hugo - author of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Les Miserables - preferred to take rather less comfortable ice baths.

Charles Dickens spent a long time eating dinner, while Kingsley Amis drank scotch and William Styron spent from 8pm to midnight drinking and smoking.

The chart reveals that Ludwig van Beethoven was very particular about his coffee, insisting that exactly 60 beans were put in a cup, while Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky preferred tea as well as reading the Bible and philosophy books.

Out of the four composers on the chart, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is the only one who did not regularly go for long walks for inspiration. Perhaps this was because he spent around four hours a day giving music lessons to earn money.

He is not the only famous creative mind to have a day job to fund his creative ventures.

German Philosopher Immanuel Kant lectured at a university, Kurt Vonnegut taught at a school, Sigmund Freud typically spent four hours a day treating patients and Franz Kafka worked at the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute.

The chart 
also reveals the strange quirks that helped great thinkers to work. 
Balzac wore a 'monkish robe and Moroccan slippers' while Maya Angelou 
worked in an anonymous hotel room and Dickens insisted on silence to pen
 his prose.

Mozart, Freud, Kafka, Picasso and Gustave Flaubert, the author of Madame Bovary, all worked into the early hours of the morning.

The chart says: 'The brain functions differently at various times of the day. Studies show that early risers tend to be good at making plans, while those who work late into the night enjoy more divergent thinking.'

When it comes to favourite meals, Immanuel Kant ate a pub meal of meat and wine for lunch, as did Kingsley Amis who always had a coffee after his meal. However, the author of Lucky Jim did have a healthy breakfast, consisting of grapefruit, a banana and cereal.

Composer Richard Straus ate a breakfast of three eggs, tea and jam, while Flaubert also ate eggs, vegetables, cheese or fruit - as well as a cup of cold chocolate.
