Betrayal: Lyndsay Murphy, 33, has been jailed for eight months for stealing from the 93-year-old

A carer 'totally betrayed' a 93-year-old dementia sufferer by drawing thousands from her bank account and setting it aside to pay for a gardener and milk.

Lyndsay Murphy has been jailed for eight months over the scam, which was only rumbled by the vulnerable pensioner's family after she had stolen £2,600.

Her elderly victim's health deteriorated after her bank balance plummeted and she is now confined to a care home, Liverpool Crown Court heard.

Today the victim's son said she was 'ashamed' at the theft that tore her life apart.

He told the court in a victim impact statement: 'Our family feels totally betrayed by Lyndsay Murphy as we trusted her to care for our mother.

'At a time in her life when she deserved to be treated with dignity and respect because of her age and vulnerability, she has found herself having to deal with a stressful situation.

'She was ashamed she was taken advantage of by someone she liked and trusted.' 

Murphy, 33, visited the victim three times a week between August 2013 and January last year as part of her job with the agency Community Caring, the court heard.

On nine occasions she withdrew £200 to £500 from the pensioner's account at a bank branch in Eastham, Merseyside - putting aside the money to pay for milk and a gardener.

Her scam was only rumbled when the pensioner's son noticed her bank balance had dropped despite only he, his brother and sister-in-law having access to her cards.

The family retrieved statements which showed each withdrawal corresponded to a day when Murphy was meant to be caring for her.

Murphy was suspended by the agency and police traced her to the scene using the bank's CCTV. 

Murphy, who has no previous convictions, voluntarily handed herself to police in March, denying the theft and claiming that she had withdrawn the money for the victim.

Tears: Murphy wept in the dock as she was jailed today at Liverpool Crown Court

She was later arrested at her home following further enquiries, telling police 'I don't know what you're talking about' as she was cautioned.

Murphy wept in the dock after she admitted theft.

Ben Jones, defending, said she could lose her home and her 14-year-old daughter, who may have to be placed in care while she serves her sentence.

Judge Denis Watson, QC, said: 'This was a significant and repeated abuse of trust. She was an extremely vulnerable victim.

'The effect on her is in reality incalculable because as her health diminished, the confidence she had in anyone to care for her, knowing she had been taken advantage of, was completely destroyed.

'I have no doubt at all that her ability to trust strangers never returned.'
