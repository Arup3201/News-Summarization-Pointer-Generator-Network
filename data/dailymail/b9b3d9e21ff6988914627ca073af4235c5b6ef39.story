A bench warrant has been issued in Maryland for civil rights icon Walter Fauntroy.

The 82-year-old pastor and former Congressman, who was a trusted aid to Martin Luther King Jr., has had his passport revoked as a result of the warrant.

Fauntroy is believed to be somewhere in Africa, according to friends and family.

The warrant stems from an event to celebrate the inauguration of Barack Obama in Maryland in 2009 that Fauntroy was involved in organizing.

Warrant: Walter Fauntroy, a trusted aid to Martin Luther King Jr., is wanted over his involvement in an event for the 2009 Presidential Inauguration and a $50,000 check he wrote for the function that bounced. He is seen here with the Rev. Al Sharpton in Washington in August 2010

According to WUSA9, he and some others hired vendors for the function, however the party never actually happened.

A $50,000 check he wrote to cover expenses then bounced.

If and when Fauntroy re-enters the country, he will be arrested.

Bench warrants are usually issued by judges  for persons deemed to be in contempt of court.

Suspicions were raised about Fauntroy's possible disappearance in November when he missed the funeral of fellow civil rights activist and friend Marion Barry, who served three terms as mayor of the District of Columbia.

He then failed to participate in any events related to the 50th anniversary of Selma.

Fauntroy started going to Africa, first to Libya - where he claimed to have a relationship with Qaddafi - before traveling to Nigeria and Dubai. 

Friends and family report they don't know why Fauntroy would be in Africa.

They have also questioned his mental state, living accommodations, and believe he has no source of income, WUSA9 reported.

In 1959, Fauntroy became pastor of the New Bethel Baptist Church in Washington, D.C., succeeding his mentor, Reverend Charles David Foster, who had just passed away.

The following year Martin Luther King and Wyatt Tee Walker asked him to become the District of Columbia branch director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).

Fauntroy accepted and became the civil rights organization’s lobbyist in Congress until 1970. 

He lobbied for the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and worked on the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, the Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights March in 1965, and the Meredith Mississippi Freedom March in 1966.
