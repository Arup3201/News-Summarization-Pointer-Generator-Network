Sir Rory Collins, who is to lead new research into the mass prescription of statins and their side effects 

A renowned professor whose research led to the mass prescription of statins is carrying out a major review into their safety.

Sir Rory Collins of Oxford University is to examine the records of tens of thousands of patients to establish how many may have suffered side effects.

The scientist has previously carried out studies showing that prescribing the drugs more widely could save 2,000 lives a year in Britain and prevent 10,000 heart attacks and strokes.

His research helped shape NHS guidelines issued last year recommending that GPs offer them to around 40 per cent of all adults. He still believes the benefits of statins outweigh the risks – and warned of ‘averse public health consequences’ if patients stop taking them.

But Professor Collins has acknowledged that his earlier studies looking at the benefits of statins did not properly investigate all the side effects. 

These only looked at the possible risk of dying, suffering a heart attack or developing cancer. Other known side effects include muscular pain, type 2 diabetes, nausea and memory loss.

There is also concern statins increase obesity and inactivity as patients see them as a ‘licence’ to lead unhealthy lifestyles.

Professor Collins and his Oxford colleagues will now review patient records from all the previous studies to check how many suffered ‘adverse’ effects.

Statins are prescribed to between five and ten million adults in Britain including those with heart disease or deemed at risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke in future.

They work by reducing the level of cholesterol in the blood.

If this is too high, fatty deposits form on the walls of the arteries which can trigger heart attacks, strokes and sharp chest pain, or angina.  

Very little is known about the risks of taking statins, as drug companies have refused to publish the data from their trials.

But according to some studies, up to one in 50 patients can develop type 2 diabetes. A further one in 50 suffers from severe muscular pain that affects their daily activities.

Around one in ten patients experiences milder side effects that can include a runny nose, headaches, nose bleeds, nausea and a sore throat.

Several leading doctors have also revealed that they have stopped taking statins, after either experiencing side effects or failing to be convinced that they were doing any good. These include Dr Kailash Chand, deputy chair of the British Medical Association, who took them for two years and developed muscle pain.

Dr Haroun Gajraj, a vein surgeon from Dorset, took them for eight years but found his cholesterol actually came down after he stopped.

Statins work by blocking the action of an enzyme responsible for regulating many systems and chemical reactions in the body, including the production of cholesterol and lipoproteins. The drugs have been used since the 1980s for their cholesterol-lowering properties, but in the last few years they have gained ‘superdrug’ status for their ability to prolong life.

Professor Collins, who was knighted for his services to science in 2010, sent an email confirming his intentions last week.

It said: ‘In light of the concerns that have been raised about possible adverse effects of statin therapy’, the researchers are ‘seeking individual patient data on all of the other adverse outcomes that were recorded in the trials.’

The email added that the study would attempt to work out the likelihood of patients suffering any form of side effects from taking statins. 

It said this would be ‘challenging’ given the vast numbers of patients involved, but ‘necessary’ in light of the concerns.

Professor Collins is understood to want to refute previous inaccurate claims that as many as one in five patients suffered side effects.

One of the main worries surrounding statins is that too little is known about the risks, as drug companies fail to publish data. 

Dr Sarah Wollaston, Tory MP for Totnes and chairman of the Commons health select committee, said: ‘I’m concerned there may be side effects that have not been reported. Drug manufacturers should release all their trial data on statins so they are available for scrutiny.’

Klim McPherson, professor of public health at Oxford University, said: ‘We know these drugs have side effects but we do not know if these have been assessed properly by the drug companies.’

Last July, NHS rationing body Nice said statins should be prescribed to 17million adults, nearly 40 per cent of the population.

Its guidance said GPs should offer them to anyone deemed to have a 10 per cent risk of suffering a stroke or heart attack in a decade.
