Manuel Pellegrini has won his first battle over Louis van Gaal by capturing Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna.

The France full back has agreed a three-year deal at Manchester City worth - inclusive of add-ons and bonuses - £150,000-per-week after choosing them ahead of neighbours United.

Sagna travelled up to Manchester on Monday morning to finalise his move to the Etihad Stadium - news exclusively revealed by Sportsmail.

And Pellegrini was forced to fend off late interest from United to secure Sagna's services after Van Gaal made an 11th hour attempt to hijack the deal.

City's move for the Frenchman was at such an advanced stage at the point of United's first contact with the player's representatives that barring a total collapse in talks, City were always in pole position to sign Sagna.

He becomes the latest Gunner to move to the Etihad - following in the footsteps of Emmanuel Adebayor, Samir Nasri, Kolo Toure and Gael Clichy. 

Only on Sunday, Arsenal fans at the 
club's FA Cup trophy parade made their feelings regarding Sagna clear as they sang: 'We want you to stay'.

Gesture: Arsenal fans are keen for Sagna to stay, but it looks as though he's played his final game for the club

However, Sagna's anger at the way his contract situation has been handled by Arsenal has played an integral role in his decision to quit the club.

Sagna, who leaves the Gunners on a free transfer, will officially join City on July 1.

His move comes after a long-running transfer saga at the Emirates Stadium that has seen Sagna reject three contract offers - all of them below his £100,000-per-week wage demands.
