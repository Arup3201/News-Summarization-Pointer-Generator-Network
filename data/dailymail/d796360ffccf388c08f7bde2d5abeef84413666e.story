With wide eyes, orange scales and a distinctive white stripe, it could be the star of Disney's animated film Finding Nemo.

But this colourful clownfish was, in fact, spotted exploring the reefs of Wakatobi National Park, just south of the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia. 

It could be seen hiding behind rocks, swimming among sea anemones and peering out through the marine creatures' tentacles.

The stunning scene was caught on camera by Italian diver and photographer Marco Fierli, who described the tropical fish as 'striking' but camera-shy. 

'The clownfish was very shy, and I had to be very patient and to ensure I had the camera in the right position,' said the 42-year-old.

'It was very overcast when I went on the dive, which provided a great contrast of colour. The striking colours made it look like a setting from another world.'

The underwater images bear an unmistakeable resemblance to a scene in the hit Pixar film, which 
tells the story of a missing clownfish named Nemo.

In the movie, Nemo and his father Marlin are pictured chatting to each other as they swim among the tentacles of sea anemones.

As clownfish are the only fish that do not get stung by sea anemones, they often use them to shelter from predators.

The eye-catching fish are usually orange and white in colour - although others have been 
spotted sporting different colours, including blue and yellow.

Beautiful: The Indonesian clownfish was caught on camera by Italian-born diver and photographer Marco Fierli, who described it as 'striking' but very camera-shy

Mr Fierli, who lives with his partner Shoko in Indonesia, has spent 10 years travelling the world to dive and take photographs along idyllic coastlines.

'After moving to Egypt in 2004 and becoming a diving instructor, I really developed a passion for underwater photography,' he said.

'I really enjoy diving alone and spending time trying to capture the best photographs possible.'
