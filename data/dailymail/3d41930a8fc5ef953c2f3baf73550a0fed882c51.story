A bank manager said he and his mother were strapped to supposed explosives after two masked suspects broke into their home on Monday morning.

The man said he was then forced to drive the suspects to the Achieve Financial Credit Union in New Britain, Connecticut, which, sources say, the suspects planned to rob.

It wasn't until officers responded to the home invasion call in Bristol and found a woman tied to her bed, with an explosive placed underneath, that they realized the two incidents were connected. 

Police said they have not yet determined if the bank manager is a victim or a suspect.  

The manager of Achieve Financial Credit Union (pictured) and his mother were strapped to supposed explosive devices after two masked suspects broke into their Bristol, Connecticut home Monday morning

Police found the man sitting outside the bank alone in a car with a device still strapped to his body. Officers cleared the area and brought in the FBI, bomb squad and SWAT team

The mother was found at the home (pictured) tied to her bed, with a device underneath. Although police have not identified the man, public records show the house belongs to credit union CFO Matthew Yussman

Sources say the suspects told Yussman he would have to 'empty the vault', but that he was able to call a co-worker who notified police 

When police arrived at the scene they found the man sitting alone in a car outside the Credit Union, the explosives still tied to his body. 

The man said the intruders threatened to kill both him and his mother if he did not take cash out of the credit union, according to the Hartford Courant. 

The suspects had disappeared by the time police arrived.  

Although he has not yet been identified by police, public records show the home in Bristol belongs to credit union CFO Matthew Yussman, according to WFSB. 

Neighbors told say he lives at the house with his mother.

The man was kept in the vehicle while officers 'cleared the area of residents and shut down nearby roadways,' New Britain Police Chief James Wardwell said during a press conference. 

Public works trucks were brought in as 'shields' because, according to Wardwell, they would be large enough to withstand a blast or 'keep a vehicle from fleeing'. 

After the device was removed from the man's body and turned over to the FBI, he was handcuffed and taken to the hospital for evaluation. 

Both devices were determined 'not to be real', according to NBC Connecticut. 

Police said they are searching for multiple suspects and neither the man nor his mother were injured.  

The bank manager is being interviewed and is still under investigation, according to Wardwell.  

'We're considering all possibilities, whether or not he was coerced, doing something against his will, or a suspect,' he said.

The bank was surrounded for hours by the FBI, bomb squad and SWAT team and nearby schools were placed on a soft lockdown. 

Several city blocks were also closed, sending nearby areas into gridlock. 

By mid-afternoon Wardwell declared the threat to be over. 

New Britain mayor Erin Stewart likewise declared on Twitter that the situation was cleared. 

She wrote that it was 'not fully resolved' but that there were no injuries and the public was not in danger 'at this point'.
