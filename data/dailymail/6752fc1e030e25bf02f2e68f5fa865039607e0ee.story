He may be widely recognised as the world's most popular athlete, but that doesn't stop Usain Bolt from getting the jitters when he comes face to face with his sporting idols.

Speaking in an interview with Sport Magazine, the 100 metre World Record holder was keen to reveal all about his beloved Manchester United.

When speaking about football, conversations with Bolt rarely bypass his burning desire to pull on that famous red jersey... although he thinks that ship may now have sailed with the appointment of new manager Louis van Gaal. 

The world's fastest man, Jamaica's Usain Bolt, spoke in an interview about his three favourite sports

'I'd play football for Manchester United, definitely. I'm a winger. I don't know if there's space for me now though,' Bolt said.

'This new coach seems kinda serious!' he added.

When given the proposition of watching just three sports for the rest of his life, the 28-year-old's first two answers were a no-brainer: 'Football and track and field.'

'(and) I love the NBA, so I'd have to pick that.' 

An avid sports follower the Jamaican is a huge fan of the NBA, but in contrast to his football loyalties, Boltis open to change when it comes to which team he backs.

Bolt said he is a big follower of the NBA and that his favourite player is Brooklyn Nets' Kevin Garnett

'I basically support whichever team Kevin Garnett is playing for, so right now it's Brooklyn Nets. 

'He's a legend, but I hope he's gonna retire soon because I need to support a better team!' 

Moving on to his more personal matters, the London 2012 three-time gold medalist reminisced on being starstruck for the first time.

'When I first started out in track and field, I went to Manchester United. I was so happy. 

'I got to meet Cristiano Ronaldo - who I was a big fan of - and Wayne Rooney.

'Meeting Didier Drogba for the first time was cool, too. What makes it amazing to me is that they actually knew who I was, so that was kind of cool.'  

The 28-year-old said he remembers the first time he met Cristiano Ronaldo, then at Manchester United

Bolt also said he was amazed at how stars like Wayne Rooney (left) and Didier Drogba (right) knew him
