He toiled day and night in icy streams around the mountains of Scotland.

John Greenwood was searching for gold with one aim in mind – to make engagement and wedding rings for his sweetheart from the thousands of tiny specks of precious metal he was collecting.

It was a pure labour of love. And today, as he returned with his delighted new bride from a Caribbean marriage ceremony, it was clear it had all panned out okay.

Morag's engagement ring (pictured), like the wedding bands, was hallmarked simply as 'Scottish gold' because gold from there is so rare 

In total John spent over 18 months painstakingly panning for tiny flecks of gold in the hills

Mr Greenwood and Morag Shearer tied the knot when the explosives technician slipped a beautifully crafted band on his fiancee’s finger, and she put a matching ring on his.

Yesterday the man with the Midas touch (not to mention a rare romantic streak) looked back on his time knee-deep in the upper reaches of Highland rivers and declared: ‘I put a lot of effort into it . . . but it was worth it.’

Mr Greenwood wanted to pop the question with a unique ring. Not for him, however, the cheapskate trick of sawing off a piece of copper pipe, or popping to Argos. 

During three months from September 2011, equipped with just a trowel, shovel, rake and pan, he quietly went for gold – and emerged a winner.  

John needed to collect far more gold than was used in the finished ring, to allow the jeweller to melt and cast it

 John only paid £500 for a jeweller to cast the collected gold into the designed rings 

Gold experts say John must have the Midas touch, after he collected 34 grammes in a few months

He used a simple gold pan, trowel, shovel and rake to collect nuggets, flakes and tiny specks

The tiny separate amounts John had collected had to be melted together before being cast 

‘I was driven by it,’ the 48-year-old said. ‘They talk about gold fever – I was panning for gold in my dreams. Some days I’d be camping next to the river and I’d start as soon as the sun was up, and carry on for 14 or 15 hours. 

'Everybody says I must have beginner’s luck to find so much but I was out there every weekend and in the evenings in freezing cold water. I reckon I spent about 20 full days getting enough for the engagement ring.’ 

By December, the Perthshire native had 34g of flakes, dust and the odd small nugget for Mull of Kintyre goldsmith Grant Logan to melt, shape and embed with diamonds. 

The gold has a purity of approximately 22+ carats and a significantly greater value than the gold market value thanks to its rarity.

The following Christmas Day he surprised Miss Shearer, 42, with the ring. Then, it was back to the chilly waters of the River Tay and the Highland Boundary Fault.

Over 18 months, he found almost 70g for wedding bands. Mr Logan told him: ‘A lot of people spend a lifetime panning in Scotland without finding enough for a ring.’

The rings cost a bargain £500. But to Miss Shearer, they are priceless.

‘I feel very proud of John and very lucky,’ the physiotherapist said.

The bands were proudly engraved ‘Scottish Gold’, a provenance that will greatly increase their value. Gold from Scotland is relatively rare, and is not available commercially.

Last Thursday, the intrepid prospector and his bride flew to Antigua to become Mr and Mrs Greenwood. ‘It was an amazing feeling to put the ring on her finger,’ he said. ‘I was really overwhelmed.’ 

It seems there IS gold in them there hills – and in Scotland, lucky prospectors have been reaping its rewards for centuries.

The first known discovery was made in 1239. In 1818, a single large nugget found in Sutherland was made into a ring, still owned by the local Duke’s family.

Today some holiday firms offer prospecting holidays, but few strike it rich. A specialist website shows nuggets totalling 200g – the result of five years’ panning.

However, Scottish gold is very pure, at least 22 carats. Totally pure gold is rated 24-carat. In this form, it is very soft, so most good quality jewellery is made from tougher 18-carat gold.

Regular 22-carat gold is valued at £20 to £22 per gram at current prices – making the flakes and nuggets Mr Greenwood found worth well over £2,000.

Not all of his haul went into the rings themselves. A certain amount of excess raw material was needed so jeweller Mr Logan could cast them successfully.

The pair exchanged rings in a dream wedding on the paradise island of Antigua, in the West Indies

The couple wed in Antigua on Thursday 25 September with a small group of family members and are returning to Scotland today
