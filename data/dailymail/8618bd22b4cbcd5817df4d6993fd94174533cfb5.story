A man with a pair of scissors sticking out of his head stunned hospital staff when he  walked into A&E and politely asked staff if they could help him.

Blood-soaked Jonas Acevedo Monroy, 32, was nicknamed 'The Gentleman' because of his good manners.

Mr Monroy had been in his local bar in the city of Chihuahua in north-western Mexico, when  a jealous rival came over and began to hassle him.

His friend Nandor Altamirano Carvajal, 30, said: 'Jonas was as always full of high spirits and was being charming with everyone in the bar when one of the locals took umbrage.

Jonas Acevedo Monroy, 32, was stabbed in the head by a rival in a bar. When he arrived at hospital he calmly asked A&E staff for help. Initially they thought it was a joke, but helped him when he fainted

'He came over and started trying to wind Jonas up, but when that didn't work he started getting abusive and aggressive.

'Jonas offered to buy the man a drink but the guy pulled out a pair of scissors from his jacket and stabbed him in the head.

'What he was doing with a pair of scissors in his pocket I don't know, it was really shocking.'

Mr Armendariz, 30, fled, leaving Mr Caravajal to help his bleeding friend to his car and drive him to the hospital.

When he arrived at A&E, Mr Monroy politely told staff 'I have a small problem.'

At first staff thought the scissors in his head were some sort of joke, but after Mr Monroy collapsed, they rushed him into the emergency room.

A hospital spokesman said: 'Staff were very surprised when the two walked in and the man with the scissors in his head shook the receptionist's hand and said he seemed to have a small problem and would the receptionist mind helping him.

'He had been stabbed in the upper-left side of his skull and the scissors had penetrated his parietal brain lobe.

'He is lucky to be alive.'

Mr Monroy had been stabbed in the left side of his skull, in the part of his brain called the paretial lobe, which is responsible for sensations, perception and spatial awareness. 'He is lucky to be alive', doctors said

The parietal lobes are the parts of the brain responsible for sensations, perception, processing sensory information into a visual image and spatial co-ordination.

People with damage to their parietal lobes show abnormalities in body image and spatial relations, according to the U.S.' Centre For Neuro Skills.

Damage to the left parietal lobe, the part of the brain injured in Mr Monroy's case, can sometimes result in Gerstmann's Syndrome, which leaves people confused about left and right and with difficulty writing and with mathematics.

It can also produce language disorders, the inability to perceive objects normally and affect verbal memory and the ability to recall digits.

Injuries where an object has penetrated the head are rare but are a potentially life threatening condition, according to the Asian Journal of Neurosurgery.

The news comes after MailOnline reported on the case of a Brazilian man, Juacelo Nunes, (pictured) who drove for two hours with a knife in his head after being stabbed at a party

Stab wounds found in the skull from sharp edge weapons like knives are common in South Africa, because of very strict gun control laws, the journal said.

There are high incidences of stab wounds of the left side of the skull when people are hit from the front, probably because most assailants are right-handed, it added.

The news comes after MailOnline reported on the case of a Brazilian man who drove for two hours with a knife in his head after being stabbed at a party.

Juacelo Nunes travelled 60 miles from the remote village of Agua Branca to the municipality of Teresina – both in northeastern Piaui state, despite having a 30cm knife sticking out of the side of his skull.

Upon arriving at the hospital with the blade still embedded in his head, doctors discovered the 39-year-old had severed nerves and veins in his face - injuries that could easily have proved fatal.

But despite the serious nature of his injuries, the motorcycle taxi driver made a full recovery and was allowed out of hospital to celebrate New Year at home with his wife.
