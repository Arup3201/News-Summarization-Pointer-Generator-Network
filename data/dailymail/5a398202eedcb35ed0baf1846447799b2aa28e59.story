A teenager has been arrested after he allegedly burned his 4-year-old half-brother with cigarettes.

Timothy Rowland, 18, was taken into police custody after his little brother told police ‘Timothy did it’.

The abuse was uncovered when the 4-year-old's father visited their home in Yelm, Washington and found the burn on the young boy’s arm.

Arrested: Timothy Rowland, 18, has been charged with child assault following his little brother's accusations

A sergeant in the Army, the boy’s father had returned home from deployment in Afghanistan three days earlier.

He was alarmed by the child’s decaying teeth and noticed a significant 'cigarette burn' underneath the left forearm.

When the father, who is divorced from the mother, called police, the 4-year-old told them his half-brother had ‘set him on fire’ with a cigarette.

Danielle Hathaway, mother of the two boys fervently denies the claims made by the father of her youngest son.

‘He [Timothy] has been very good to him,’ she told KOMO news. ‘I don't believe that he would have done that. He loves him.’

However, when the police spoke to the child, the boy told police ‘they’ had been mean to him, although it has not been specified if ‘they’ means his mother and half-brother.

‘He was afraid of them and they liked to hurt him. He also mentioned that he had been kicked in the stomach,’ Chief Todd Stancil, Yelm Police, told KOMO news.

Ms Hathaway says the boy was not afraid to be in her house and blames her ex-husband for her oldest son’s arrest.

Accusations: The young boy told police he was afraid of the house and that 'they were mean'

‘I have an ex-husband that has been after me since our divorce in regards to trying to take the children away from me,’ Ms Hathaway said.

She says there are no cigarette burns on the boy and another larger burn on his arm is from an ironing accident with her. She admitted to leaving the boy’s teeth in a bad state, but said it was because she cannot afford to take him to the dentist.

‘This is nothing but lies,’ she said.

Ms Hathaway is being investigated by Yelm Police while Timothy Rowland remains in custody on a $200,000 bail charged with child assault.

The 4-year-old boy is staying with his father.
