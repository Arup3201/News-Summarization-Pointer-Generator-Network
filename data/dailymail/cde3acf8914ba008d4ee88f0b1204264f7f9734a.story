When it came to food trends in 2013, it was all about 
pulled pork, meaty gourmet burgers, stylish meringues and brand new 
innovations such as the Cronut.

Now
 some of Britain's leading food experts, including a Michelin starred 
chef, supper club owner and street food expert have been bought together
 by Warburtons, to predict what we'll be eating in 2014...

Kale was the trendy superfood of 2013 but the new rising star will be buckwheat. A fruit seed, neither a wheat or grain, is a great alternative to cous cous and quinoa and is suitable for those who are gluten intolerant. It can be used to make healthy pancakes and waffles or as a substitute for rice in a risotto-style dish.

Brit will follow the America's lead to become more experimental with their sandwich fillings

Research reveals that the UK alternative sandwich market (i.e filled snacks made from pittas, thins, wraps etc rather than slices of bread), has grown by 15 per cent in the past year.

This trend is expected to continue in 2014 with people becoming more adventurous with their fillings.

Helen Graves, author of 101 sandwiches, said: 'Experimenting with sandwich possibilities is going to be a huge trend next year in the UK, seeing sandwiches as something of a treat - more indulgent and with exciting ingredients.'

She added that this trend started in the U.S and 'their love of the open sandwich'.

Tom Sellers, the youngest chef to be awarded a Michelin star, agrees. He said: 'Like burgers in 2013, I think this year will be all about the sandwich. People have become fanatical about quality food that's easily accessible, modern and healthy and I feel that a freshly made sandwich is the perfect answer for this. A Tom Sellers sandwich would definitely include thickly sliced rare beef and plenty of horseradish.'

Rejuvenated: Truffles will become more accessible

Truffles have always been a high end restaurant staple but in 2014 they'll be more accessible to the masses in the form of truffle crisps and truffle biscuits.

Food futurologist, Morgaine Gaye, said the resurgence of truffles will come as part of a trend for foraging for food. She said: 'Rosehips, greengages, old fruits like damsons, gooseberries, foraging for food and more mushroom varieties are all going to be big. Truffles are definitely setto be this year's food hero, and it won't just be limited to specialty dishes.'

In light of a lack of faith in the meat industry following the horse meat scandal, more people are going to be turning to vegetarian options.Â 

But not everyone will forgo meat altogether and a new tribe of 'flexitarians' will be born. Flexitarians will be happy to eat quality meat but equally at home in a restaurant offering only vegetarian options.

From the growth of street food markets to supper clubs and new community food sites, 'secret spaces' is about being more adventurous when eating out and uncovering the new places to dine in your area.

Sites like such as eatmyworld.com allow people to search for pop-up restaurants and supper clubs near to them.

The 'at home chef' refers to people becoming more ambitious and experimental with their cooking. Access to professional tools and techniques such as curing and smoking meats as well as adopting techniques such as sous vide, will become popular as people look to emulate restaurant quality food in the comfort of their own home.

They can even make money out of their talent thanks to websites such as Cookisto.co.uk where amateur chefs can advertise their meals for people in their surrounding area to buy. The service is an alternative to traditional takeaways for those who don't have the time to cook.

Founder of Cookisto.co.uk, Michalis Gkandas, said: 'For me, 2014 will be the year of sharing and being able to incorporate people's love of cooking into a sustainable profession. Diners are becoming more food savvy than ever before and Cookisto gives diners the power to take bids fromchefs to ensure they get exactly what they are looking for and chefs the power to reach a growing engaged audience.'
