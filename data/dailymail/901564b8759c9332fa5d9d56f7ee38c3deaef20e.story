Firefighters in hazmat suits, police, US Secret Service officials and an Army explosives team converged on a quiet residential street in Washington DC after a homeowner found a suspicious syrupy substance inside a 40-year-old safe.

First responders were called to the home at 3736 Kanawah Street Northwest at around 4pm Monday.

According to investigators, the house had recently been sold, and the new owner was in the process of going through its contents when he came across an old safe in the basement.

Suspicious substance: A Washington DC opened a 40-year-old safe, only to discover vials of syrupy white substance that required the presence of Army explosives experts, firefighters and paramedics 

Suite up: A hazmat team marched inside the home on Kawanah Street and carried away several containers filled with the mystery goo, which had a chemical reaction with water 

The unnamed resident said inside the strongbox he found vessels containing a white, gooey matter.

Firefighters who responded to the address entered the home in protective gear and removed several vials of powder and liquids, which were taken to a an environmental testing facility.

DC Fire Spokesman Timothy Wilson said they were baffled when on-scene tests could not positively identify the mystery liquid found in the safe, which firefighters initially took to be a spilled household cleaner.

But surprise quickly turned into alarm when the syrupy sludge reacted with water.

‘We wanted to be as thorough and careful as possible when we moved it,’ Wilson told Washington Post.
