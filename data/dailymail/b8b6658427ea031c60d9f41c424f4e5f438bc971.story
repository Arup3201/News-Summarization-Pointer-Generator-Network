Strictly Come Dancing finalist Natalie Gumede has had to repeatedly ask the show's designers to add more material to her skimpy outfits, claiming they are 'too revealing'.

The 29-year-old actress, who played Kirsty Soames in Coronation Street, is one of four female stars in Saturday's show along with BBC Breakfast host Susanna Reid, singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor and model Abbey Clancy.

Natalie, who said she preferred to be 'modest', said she has had to request fabric is added to most of her dresses.

She said: ‘It's kind of down to costume in a way. I kind of turn up on Friday and see how much material is in the dress and nine times out of 10 I get some added.’

She added: ‘I think sometimes costume see you objectively and sort of go, well that looks good because they're seeing the show and say 'well you look great in that', whereas as a person you have to be comfortable so it's just finding that happy medium and they will always work with you on that.’

The actress is lagging behind the other three celebrities in the betting to win according to bookmakers.

William Hill is offering odds of 9-1 on her winning, with Reid 6-5 favourite, Clancy at 9-4 and Ellis-Bextor at 5-2.

‘There is hardly anything between them.’

Meanwhile her fellow contestant Sophie, has said that appearing on the show had been ‘a privilege’ and would ‘hopefully make me a little more fearless’.

Modest: The actress picked this long blue gown as her favourite from the series

The singer said: ‘I've never really been so petrified so regularly and then had that rush of getting through it and it working out and that's an amazing reward for the nerves you feel beforehand.

‘My dad's been joking with me that I have to go through a similar Strictly kind of experience but with other life skills so maybe you learn a different language every week and then perform a monologue in that language on Saturday nights or different instruments would be good, or maybe household skills.

‘I've got the foxtrot and now I need to know how to do some plumbing and basic electrical work.’If she wins it will be a second victory for her dance partner Brendan Cole who said this series had been the best ‘by a country mile’.

He said: ‘I don't say it lightly. I've had some really good series and great partners over the years but Sophie has been very different to work with, we've had a very good time and really bonded.’
