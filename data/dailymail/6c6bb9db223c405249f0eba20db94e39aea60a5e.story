Two men who partied with missing Indiana college student Lauren Spierer the night she vanish have responded to her parents' lawsuit against them by claiming they are not responsible for her disappearance.

The 20-year-old coed was last seen with Corey Rossman, Jay Rosenbaum and Mike Beth on June 3, 2011 near the campus of Indiana University in Bloomington, where all four were students. 

The three men say she left them to walk back to her own apartment and was never seen again. However, Lauren's parents, Robert and Charlene Spierer, claim the men are withholding information from detectives and know more about their daughter's case than they are willing to admit.

Search: Lauren Spierer, 20, vanished two years and a half ago after a night out with friends. Her parents are now suing the two men who saw her before she went missing in a bid to find out the truth, they say

Desperate: Robert and Charlene Spierer said they do not believe the men have told everything they know

The Spierers filed a lawsuit in 
federal court in June, arguing that Mr Rossman and Mr Rosenbaum - the 
last two to see her alive - had a 'duty of care' to ensure their 
daughter's safety.

In 
December, a judge threw out the suit against Mr Beth - agreeing with his
 attorneys who said he could not be held liable simply because he was 
with her when she was intoxicated the night she vanished.

Attorneys for Mr Rossman and Mr Rosenbaum have responded.

They deny that they know anything more about Spierer's disappearance than what they have already told police.

And they say that they didn't have a 'duty of care' - or a responsibility to look after the intoxicated Spierer.

The
 Spierers are not suing Kilroy's Sports Bar, which is accused of 
continuing the serve the intoxicated underage student and her friends.

Barclay admitted that the move seemed extreme, but added to Fox News: 'Any parent in search of information about a missing child would use every resource available to them.

'Therefore, we intend to use the rights afforded by the civil justice system to obtain answers to questions that have gone unanswered for too long. We fully expect that those with relevant information will cooperate with this process.'

In an interview last month, the couple said they did not believe the men were telling the truth about their daughter's last hours and they are uncertain if she even left their apartment, as they have said she did.

The couple say they still believe 
someone will eventually reveal what happened to her and that it would be
 devastating to never find their daughter even though they assume she is
 dead.

Questions: Jay Rosenbaum, left, and Corey Rossman, right, saw Lauren Spierer the night she vanished

The Spierers have maintained since 
soon after Lauren vanished in the early hours of June 3, 2011, in 
downtown Bloomington that several of the people who were with her that 
night haven't fully cooperated with police.

'There's
 a sense that someday, some week things will change for us. That someone
 will have the strength, the crisis of conscience to come forward,' 
Robert Spierer has told The Herald-Times.

Lauren
 went to Rosenbaum's apartment with a friend on the night she vanished. 
She then left with Rossman and went to a bar - even though she was not 
old enough to drink.

At
 2.27am, she was caught on camera leaving the bar with Rossman to her 
apartment. But once there, he got into an altercation with another 
student who punched him.

Minutes
 later, Lauren and Rossman left the complex and walked through an 
alleyway to his apartment. At one point, he was seen carrying Spierer, 
who appeared drunk.

last known image of Lauren, who was seen incapacitated

When
 they arrived at the apartment, Mike Beth helped Rossman to his bed and 
then walked her to Rosenbaum's apartment down the hallway.

He
 said he tried to convince her to sleep on his couch, but she refused 
and he watched from his balcony as she walked home alone.

It should have taken her just six minutes to return home, but she has not been seen since.

The three young men have previously said that the Spierers are harassing
 them for information about their daughter's whereabouts. 

'We’ve done nothing wrong. If we'd 
done something wrong, we would have been arrested already. All they’re 
doing is hurting my career,' said Corey Rossman.

'It’s inappropriate the way they’re harassing people that are also victims in this case,' he told The Indianapolis Star.

Rossman told the paper that he has had 
to field phone calls from reporters, the Spierer's lawyers, and the 
Spierers themselves, though the parents deny that they ever called the 
young men.

'Rob and I have never spoken to Corey Rossman,' Lauren's mother Charlene said to the paper.

'The
 private investigators have never spoken to Corey. So I don't know how 
it is we're harassing him other than asking him to talk to the 
Bloomington police department. All of them.'

Rossman's
 lawyer has previously said that Rossman does not remember anything 
after the punch.
