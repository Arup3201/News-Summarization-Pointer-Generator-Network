Former Bordeaux and West Ham midfielder Alou Diarra has signed for Championship side Charlton Athletic following a successful trial.  

The 33-year-old free agent had been without a club since leaving West Ham in July last year after agreeing a mutual termination to his contract. 

Prior to joining Charlton, Diarra also spent time on trial with Brighton and MLS outfit Chicago fire, appearing for the latter in a friendly game against Queens Park Rangers last week.

Diarra was released from his contract with West Ham in July last year after agreeing a mutual termination 

Charlton coach Guy Luzon had said on Monday: 'Alou Diarra is training with us. It is a possibility he might sign. He is a good player. We will make the decision in two or three days.'

But with several suitors understood to be keen on the midfielder, that decision was pushed through promptly.  

Diarra, who has 44 international caps for France, has also captained his country.
