Rurik Jutting was regarded as a ‘Santa Claus’ figure by a former girlfriend and her family in the Philippines, they revealed yesterday.

The banker ‘had a hearty laugh’ and showered 22-year-old Ariane Guarin and her relatives with generosity during his visits.

He and Miss Guarin had an intense six-month relationship which ended in acrimonious circumstances about a month before he is said to have murdered two call girls in Hong Kong.

But before they split, the clearly overweight Cambridge graduate posed for pictures with her and her family in the Philippines.

The pair met while he was visiting Angeles City, a notorious sex tourist destination just north of Manila, and there are claims that Miss Guarin was a ‘working girl’ both in the Philippines and in Hong Kong.

Yesterday Miss Guarin’s family spoke of his kindness and their shock at Jutting, 29, being charged with murder in Hong Kong.

Her brother Erwin said: ‘He liked to drink and he loved to swim. He had a hearty laugh, he reminded me of Santa Claus.’

Her sister Ellen added: ‘We don’t think he is the type who could do these crimes. He was very kind.’

She said the highly-paid investment banker would fly over just for a weekend and take them all with him if he wanted to eat out or go somewhere – even joining them on a beach holiday.

She added: ‘He liked hanging out here. We would go to a nearby resort and go swimming. He would invite everyone, not just our family but our friends as well.’

Miss Guarin’s mother Nimfa said: ‘He actually wanted her to go to Hong Kong but she had yet to apply for a passport. It was a good thing she didn’t go. If Rurik was capable of those crimes, he might have hurt my daughter. But he was kind and nice to us. It’s really confusing.’

The family said the couple split up after ‘things got complicated’ over the summer. Many of the pictures Jutting posted on his Facebook page featured Miss Guarin – known to friends as Yanie and who Jutting called his ‘beautiful honey’.

Friends described her as a ‘lovely girl’. Such was their lavish lifestyle together, the couple were known as ‘Ruyanie’ – in the same way that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are known by the combined name ‘Brangelina’.

Yesterday it was revealed that police in the Philippines are investigating the disappearance of another young woman in Angeles City – the ‘sin city’ where Jutting was a frequent visitor.

The woman, in her mid-20s, vanished in the red-light district last year and her mother reported her missing.

Jutting is understood to have visited the area several times over the last 18 months. 

Earlier this week, a friend of one Jutting’s alleged victims, Robert van den Bosch, said ‘well informed sources’ had told him that the murder suspect had regularly been to Angeles City.

In one picture posted online, Jutting is seen with women in a strip bar called Rio Club – where tourists are known to pick up call girls. 

Police are expected to look at the travel movements of Jutting throughout his 18 months working in the Far East. Manila, Bangkok and the former Portuguese colony of Macau are other popular vice destinations.

Jutting, a high-paid investment banker with Merrill Lynch, left London for Hong Kong last year. He is accused of killing Seneng Mujiasih, 32, and 25-year-old Sumarti Ningsih, who was found ‘nearly beheaded’ in a suitcase on the balcony of his flat.

Merrill Lynch has declined to say if Jutting – whose out-of-office email referred to himself as ‘an insane psychopath’ – quit or was sacked.

Yesterday it emerged he had enlisted a UK-based headhunting firm to find him a new banking job in Hong Kong. Jutting is due back in court on Monday.
