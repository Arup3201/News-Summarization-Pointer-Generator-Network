The BBC has been accused of gender stereotyping after guidelines describing girls as 'over emotional' and boys as 'activity and task focused' were discovered online.

The 'Guide to the CBBC Audience', produced by the corporation's Marketing, Communications and Audiences research department, suggested girls 'have a tendency towards manipulation', while boys enjoy 'confrontation and physical strength'.

After coming under fire from equality groups, the BBC removed the guidelines from its website, admitting they were 'years out of date'.

For boys, the guide said: ‘There is a focus on doing, confrontation and physical strength and for many their football team is a top priority.

‘Boys tend to have a steady group of good friends that they knock about with rather than exclusive best friends.

‘They often think girls of their age are annoying but like to talk about their body parts and sex.’

Girls, meanwhile, ‘have a keen interest in fashion and enjoy listening to popular music’, according to the guide.

They will ‘chat enthusiastically, try to support the people they care about and form profound friendships and relationships and develop an interest in boys from age 10’.

The section of the guide titled 'Girls are girls and boys are boys' attracted the negative comment.

'Girls are more socially adept and motivated than boys,' it said, adding: 'Boys are activity and task focused. Most enjoy achieving goals and completing physical challenges.'

The guidelines have been criticised by a number of equality groups, including Let Toys Be Toys and Everyday Sexism on Twitter.

Gender historian Garthine Walker, meanwhile, tweeted: 'The gender stereotyping here would be laughable if it didn't have real implications for children.'

A BBC spokesman said: 'The document under discussion is years out of date and had mistakenly been left on our website. It has now been removed.

'At BBC Children's we believe it is important to provide all children with a range of strong role models irrespective of gender. In our documentary series My Life we've had Ballet Boys and Boxing Girls; Sarah Jane battles aliens; Helen Skelton canoed the Amazon and Stefan Gates gives cookery advice.

'We want all children to reach their full potential and make sure we avoid gender stereotyping in all our programmes.'
