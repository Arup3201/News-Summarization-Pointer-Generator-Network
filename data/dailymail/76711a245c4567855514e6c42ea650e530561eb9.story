When it comes to  iconic beaches, landmarks and landscapes - Australia arguably has some of the best in the world.

So here are a number of stunning pictures which make Aussies proud to call the nation home.

The snaps which capture Australia's natural beauty were shared through Tourism Australia's Facebook page, some listed under 'Australia Instagram Photos That Made Us Happy'.

The picture-perfect moments were collated from travelers and Aussies themselves.

Photos include the Three Sisters in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, to the sunset over the Swan River in Perth, Werribee South beach in Melbourne and Tasmania's sparkling east coast waters and of course Australia's much-loved native wildlife including koalas and kangaroos.

Welcome to Australia and enjoy.
