First former President Bill Clinton called him 'Bill' at an influential gathering of Democrats. Then Michelle Obama repeatedly botched his last name at an endorsement rally. She also confused him with his marine corps veteran father. Last week the White House misidentified the elected office he is seeking in an email to reporters.

Other politicians may have been offended by such high-profile flubs, but Iowa Rep. Bruce Braley, a Democrat candidate for the U.S. Senate, told MailOnline Sunday he's not offended that his prominent backers can't seem to get his personal details straight.

'Everyone makes mistakes,' he said.

Friends again: First lady Michelle Obama gets a hug from Iowa Senate candidate Bruce Braley during a campaign in Iowa City, Iowa, last week. Obama came back to Iowa to stump for Braley for the second time this month after a disastrous first appearance at which she repeatedly called him by the wrong name

The Iowa lawmaker explained that he's no stranger to having people mix up his last name.

A local newspaper misidentified the last name of two of his three children, Lisa, David and Paul, in their birth announcements, he said.

'One of them was listed as Barley. One of them was listed as Bradley,' he revealed. 'These are honest mistakes that people make. 

'What's more important is that people have been coming to Iowa to help to inspire Iowa voters to understand why this election is important,' he continued.

Braley pointed out that the first lady made jokes at her own expense about the gaffe when she returned to Iowa to stump for him last week.

'And you know what, Iowans are understanding and forgiving because everyone makes mistakes,' he said of the incident.

Braley, a four-term congressman, is competing against Iowa state senator Joni Ernst for the Hawkeye state's open Senate seat. Their race is one of a handful that will determine whether Republicans gain control of the legislative branch next year.

Ernst has beat out Braley  in all but two surveys taken of Iowa voters in the last month. In both instances, the lawmakers tied. Polling site Real Clear Politics continues to rank the competition as one in which either candidate could claim victory as Ernst's lead has always been within the margin of error. 

With just nine days to go until the midterm elections, both candidates spent the better part of their Sunday rushing around the state, trying to  visit with voters in all 99 of Iowa's counties.

Ernst began her day with an early morning pancake breakfast in her home town, Red Oak, a small town located in the southwestern part of the state. Braley's first public event was a meet-and-greet with canvassers in a suburb of Des Moines.

There he thanked them for their support and emphasized the importance of replacing retiring Sen. Tom Harkin with a politician who will carry on the Democratic lawmaker's legacy.

Notably absent from his stump speech was a call to action to support the embattled Democratic Party leader, President Barack Obama, by voting for himself and other Iowa Democrats.

Still, the GOP has played up the Democratic candidate's ties to President Barack Obama. A video released by the state's Republican Party last week asked voters to 'send Barack Obama a message' by voting 'no on his handpicked candidate Bruce Braley.'

Ernst has not bet the farm on the anti-Obama strategy like Republican hopefuls in other states have, however. While she has hit Braley on his vote for Obamacare and his support for the president's other 'failed policies' that she says have driven up the national debt, the conservative's message has largely focused on her own qualifications.

She has attracted positive attention with quirky ads highlighting her background in agriculture, the state's most important industry.

Standing in a pig sty, the Republican said in a March commercial, 'I'm Joni Ernst. I grew up castrating pigs on an Iowa farm, so when I get to Washington, I'll know how to cut pork.' 

The video went viral on the web and propelled her to victory in the Republican primary for the Senate. It also put her and the Iowa Senate race, which was initially considered a lock for Braley, on the map.

In a sequel ad released last week Ernst revisited the hog theme and compared Congress to a bunch of pigs.

'It's a mess. Dirty, noisy, and it stinks. Not this lot, I'm talking about the one in Washington,' the state legislator says as she's surrounded by pigs.

'Too many politicians, hogging, wasting, and full of... well let's just say, bad ideas,' Ernst adds as the camera pans to an oinking pig covered in manure.

While the ads have by and large received positive attention, Ernst's detractors have lodged complaints that they are not specific enough, and Iowa Democrats have claimed that she would support a radical Tea Party agenda if elected.

Ernst hit back at her critics on Sunday in an interview with MailOnline.

'I would not say they're lacking in substance because the overall goals, cut spending, repeal and replace Obamacare, those are pretty good goals to have.' 

Furthermore, she said, 'you can't...lay out in a 30-second ad really what, what your achievements would be in a United States Senate seat.'

Ernst argued that the ads have served their intended purpose. 'So many people are relating to those ads,' she said.

'The hogs that we've had in the ads, very creative but fun, but it's agriculture,' she said. 'And so many people have come up to me and they've said, "You know Joni, I used to do that when I was a kid, too." 

'You know, it's just part of growing up on a farm in an ag area,' she said of hog castration. 

Ernst has also made her military service a focal point of her campaign and has used it as a cudgel against her opponent, who did not serve in the armed forces.

The Iraq veteran and National Guard member reminded friends and family this morning that she was one of those boots on ground in Iraq.

'So I understand what's going in that region of the world,' she told the 50 or so attendees of the Sunday am event. 'And understanding our military affairs is something that is extremely important at a time like today, when we are seeing crises in Iraq, Ukraine and Russia, in Iran, in Israel. 

'There are so many areas that you have mentioned. Yet we have Congressman Braley and Barack Obama, they are reactive rather than proactive, she argued. 'So I believe that we need someone that has served her country, her community and her state serving in the United States Senate.'

Terry Branstad on Saturday night.  Iowa has become a popular place for for Republicans and Democrats thinking about running for president to cut their teeth this year because of the competitive federal election

Ernst did not link her opponent to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid  today, but her campaign has insinuated in the past that Braley is also in the pocket of the high-ranking Democrat.

'For Bruce Braley it has become a game of "you scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours," which is dangerous for Iowans given that radical groups like Harry Reid’s Senate Majority PAC, the American Association for Justice and the Texas Trial Lawyers Association are bankrolling his candidacy,' Ernst's spokeswoman, Gretchen Hamel, said in a statement posted on the campaign's website.

'If elected to the Senate, Bruce Braley will continue to be beholden to these extreme groups – meaning continued support of cap-and-trade, higher taxes, ObamaCare, and other job-killing legislation that will hurt Iowans…just so he can please his out-of-state liberal backers,' Hamel accused.

Braley brushed off the suggestion that he would be a rubber stamp for President Obama and Majority Leader Reid's agenda if elected to office when he spoke with MailOnline over the weekend.

'All they [Ernst and her campaign] have to do is look at how I have taken on the president on issue after issue, including the renewable fuel standard,' he shot back.

If anyone is being deceitful in this race, it's Ernst, he told reporters. A key facet of his message in the final days of the campaign, he said, will be: 'What's Joni Ernst trying to hide?'

'She's trying to hide that she's not on your side if you're in Iowa on issues like raising the minimum wage, protecting and preserving Social Security and Medicare, making college affordable, making sure that employers aren't rewarded for outsourcing jobs,' he claimed.

'I stand with Iowans, and I've made that very clear in all of the editorial board meetings I've gone to, in all of the interview I've done, just like this, in our three debates,' he said, taking a jab at Ernst's refusal to sit down with The Des Moines Register until it apologizes for statements its made about the campaign that she believes are unsavory.

'There are stark choices in this election,' Braley concluded. 'And that's what we're trying to get across to Iowans as we travel through the state.'
