Mother-of-four Miss Henderson was reported missing shortly after 8am on Thursday morning

The boyfriend of missing mother-of-four Samantha Henderson has today been charged with her murder, as police continue to hunt for her body.

Dominic Isom, 27, was remanded in custody this afternoon, nearly a week after Miss Henderson, whose children are one, two, four and six, was reported missing.

Detectives investigating her disappearance said specialist officers have now been brought in as they continue to search an area of woodland near Corfe Castle, Dorset, where she was last seen.

Miss Henderson was reported missing shortly after 8am on Thursday morning - nearly 18 hours after she was last seen collecting her children from Corfe Castle Primary School at around 3pm.

Police helicopters have scoured the area, while yesterday 35 major crime officers and forensics experts combed allotments, outbuildings and the missing mother's home.

Officers said they believe Miss Henderson 'has come to harm', and said the whereabouts of her body are still unknown. They urged members of the public to come forward with any information they may have.

Detectives seized Miss Henderson's blue Peugeot from her home on Monday night and asked the public to help trace the car's movements – especially between 3pm on Wednesday and 10.25am on Thursday.

Dorset Police said she was a 'prolific phone user' but that her mobile had not been found.

Miss Henderson lives in a £325,000 four-bedroom cottage. It is believed her partner lived there for several years, but there is a 'for sale' sign outside and she had arranged to meet a house clearance firm on Monday. 

Isom's charge comes just 24 hours after police released CCTV footage of Miss Henderson, taken on the day she was last seen. 

In it, she can be seen in the footage moving animatedly around the shop wearing a pink jumper or coat and light blue jeans. Her long blonde hair is tied up in a ponytail.

She appears to buy cigarettes from behind the counter while chatting to the shopkeeper and hesitates at the till as she enters her pin number before leaving the shop. 

Detectives leading the search for the missing mother's body are appealing for the public's help

Senior investigating officer Neil Devoto, of Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team, said: 'This is a very difficult time for [Miss Henderson's] whole family and they have requested privacy. Her children are being cared for by relatives.

'It is also important to stress – as is typical in such circumstances – that it would be entirely inappropriate for Dorset Police to comment further ahead of the trial. 

'We now believe Samantha has come to harm. At this time her whereabouts are still unknown and our search for her body continues. 

'Searches of the Corfe Castle village area are ongoing. Specialist search officers have been brought in from Dorset and neighbouring forces to continue searching an area of woodland off the A351 near Corfe Castle.

'This latest development does not mean we do not want to hear from members of the public if they have any information that could help with the investigation into Samantha's death, no matter how seemingly insignificant.

'I am also urging anyone who saw Samantha after 3pm on Wednesday, had contact with her whether by phone or social media or has any information about her movements, to call me in confidence.' 

Isom will appear before Bournemouth Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police in confidence on 101, quoting Operation Cavalier. 

Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111.

Appeal: Detectives seized Miss Henderson's blue Peugeot from her home on Monday night and asked the public to help trace the car's movements – especially between 3pm on Wednesday and 10.25am on Thursday
