Louis van Gaal  has filled his players’ heads with so much information this season they look shackled. In a dressing room where everything is analysed, the players look unable to break free. 

If ever a fixture can change that, it’s this one. Manchester United against Arsenal is a game to inspire any player and, with a potential trip to Wembley, you can see players like Wayne Rooney falling back on their natural attacking instincts. 

If they do break from Van Gaal’s mould, those creative personalities could come flooding through.

PLAYING AT PACE

United have dominated possession recently but Arsenal won’t be troubled if United play keep-ball. 

The win at City shows how they are now just as happy hitting teams on the counter as they are keeping possession. 

With Alexis Sanchez, Danny Welbeck and Theo Walcott, they have pace to burn and with no Jonny Evans it means another change in the United backline, which will only increase uncertainty.

Arsenal speedsters such as Theo Walcott can cause United's defence all sorts of problems at Old Trafford 

WATCH OUT FOR WELBECK

Danny Welbeck would have been smarting when he was sold by Van Gaal. He is a good finisher, a mature player and there is no way he will want to see United troop out for a Cup final in May.

THE FORTRESS IS CRUMBLING 

When Arsenal last played United in the FA Cup, Sir Alex Ferguson’s side won 2-0 in 2011. Since he left, Old Trafford has not been the same. In a season and a half, United have lost nine league games at home. 

That’s as many as Ferguson lost in his last six seasons. Teams don’t fear going there and even the home fans don’t know what to expect these days. Arsenal will hope to exploit any doubts. 

Old Trafford has not quite been the fortress of old since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure 

Van Gaal's  side have played 33 games this season, nine fewer than Arsenal, so should be fresher. In the table of minutes played by both squads, only two United players are in the top 10 and one is goalkeeper David de Gea.

MY MEMORIES OF A CLASSIC RIVALRY 

There has always been a great rivalry between these sides, but I never played at Old Trafford with any fear. I went there as a youngster in 1986 and won with Arsenal and during the Wenger years we had a team that could go and win anywhere.

We were a physical team but we could play, and it was almost a compliment when United tried to match our physicality.

In 1999, Ryan Giggs scored that classic FA Cup goal and it turned the season. Arsenal could have won the double but United went on to win the treble. Andy Cole made a run to drag me out of position, but sometimes you just have to admire moments of genius.

The other game people love to remind me of is the ‘Battle of Old Trafford’ in 2003. In the little black book of opposition players, Ruud van Nistelrooy was one not to be trusted. 

He was a top player and a fighter, but he would look for any reason to go down. Perhaps I overreacted, but the whole team was infuriated by him. And I’m still not convinced I deserved to give away the penalty that Ruud eventually missed!
