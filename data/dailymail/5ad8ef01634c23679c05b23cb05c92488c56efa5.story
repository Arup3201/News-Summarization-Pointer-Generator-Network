Two teenage fans of Coronation Street spent six months saving £2,000 to go to Nando's with the soap's Brooke Vincent, it has been revealed.

Ruth Challis and Rosy Cooper hired the actress, who has played Sophie Webster in Coronation Street for 10 years, as a long-awaited birthday treat to themselves.

Brooke assumed she was attending a large function - but when she arrived at the chicken diner to see just Ruth, 18, and Rosy, 19, she took it in her stride and they later split the bill.

Superfans: Two Corrie-loving teenagers saved £2,000 for a birthday dinner with star Brooke Vincent (left) at a branch of Nando's, it has been revealed. The star reportedly thought she was attending a large function

Brooke tweeted after the dinner on July 12: 'Had the pleasure of meeting these two beautiful young ladies today. Thank you for a lovely day. Happy birthday.'

They had taken six months to save the appearance fee - so Brooke decided to refund the £2,000 as a tribute to their dedication. 

A source close to the star said: 'She didn't realise it was two girls who had saved up for six months until she arrived, so she did the right thing straight away and refunded the fee to them.'

The trio then had a meal together and split the bill at Nando's three ways, the Sunday Mirror reported.

A friend of the girls, who both work part-time at fast food outlets, told the newspaper: 'They 
think Brooke is a great actor and they really wanted to meet her.

'They
 worked out they worked 800 hours between them to save the money.'

Restaurant: The trio split the bill at this branch of the chicken shop in Spinningfields, Manchester city centre

The girls, from Coventry, visited the 
Spinningfields branch of Nando's in Manchester city centre before taking
 part in the Coronation Street tour at MediaCity, Salford.

Ruth tweeted: 'Had the most amazing night... Thank you,' while her friend said it was a 'whirlwind of a weekend' adding: 'Had such a special birthday night, thank you so much @BrookeLVincent.'

The 22-year-old actress rose to fame as a child star in Coronation Street and later became one half of the soap's first lesbian couple.

She and Sacha Parkinson, who played Sian Powers, had an on-screen romance which ended in a furious wedding day row when Parkinson left the programme.

Brooke Vincent was brought up in Greater Manchester where the soap is filmed, going to school in the town of Droylsden as she simultaneously appeared in the show.

She split last month from Chelsea midfielder Josh McEachran, and joked to The Sun that she had trouble attracting men - because they assumed her sexuality was the same as her character's.  

Her on-screen character has since had a relationship with with tearaway Maddie Heath, played by Amy-James Kelly, and last week it was revealed that Vincent has signed another year's contract in the soap.

A Coronation Street spokesman told MailOnline: 'Brooke was really happy she could make their birthdays special.'
