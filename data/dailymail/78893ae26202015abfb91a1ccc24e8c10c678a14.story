They were supposed to be the government's way of giving support to new parents right up until their children started at school.

But one four-year-old boy from Manchester will be forced to begin his education at a Sure Start centre due to a lack of primary school places.

Seth Skelton-Thake - who lives less than a mile from four junior schools - failed to get a place at any of them.

And the youngster is not alone as primary schools across the country struggle to cope with the soaring demand for places.

Figures released last month show that nearly a third of five-year-olds in parts of London missed out on their first choice.

The statistics, published by the Pan-London Admissions Board last month, revealed that across the capital more than 20 per cent of youngsters did not get a place at their preferred school.

Seth's parents Mikala and James, both 33, from 
Withington, Greater Manchester, said they sent off applications to four schools within a day
of getting their application forms - and several weeks before the 
deadline last December.

His mother Mikala, a nurse, said: 'I was stunned when I found out he had no place at all.

'The
council told me that they expected two per cent of children would not 
get a place and they were arranging for him to have lessons in a Sure 
Start centre.

'This is no start to an education and there will be others 
in the same situation.

'I’d rather he was taught at home than a Sure Start centre with younger children.'

Manchester council has already admitted that dozens of youngsters are likely to be left without a place in September but declined to comment on Seth's case.

Councillor Afzal Khan, executive 
member for children’s services in Manchester, said: 'We are looking at 
how we create more places in the city. We know there’s a problem and 
it’s a problem across the country.'

And competition for places at primary schools is not the only worry facing parents.

It was revealed in February that thousands of children across the country face the prospect of learning in converted sheds and shops as the competition for primary school places continues to rise.

Pupils have been crammed into makeshift temporary classrooms, and even vacated high street stores as immigration and baby booms make places harder to come by.

According to the Department for Education, it is expected that primary schools in England will need to find space for more than 800,000 children of primary school age by 2020.

This will mean up to 3,200 additional schools will be needed to cope with the additional demand.

A legacy of the Labour government 
under Tony Blair, Sure Start centres were heralded as a way of giving 
children 'the best possible start in life' when they were launched in 
1998.

There are now more than 3,600 of them in England offering a range of advice and support to new parents.

They are intended for mothers to use during pregnancy right the way until a child goes into reception at primary school.

Since
their launch however, the Sure Start brand has been extended to cover a
broader responsibility up to age 14, or even 16 for children
with disabilities.

The move could lead to more children starting their education at Sure Start centres due to a lack of places at primary schools.
