The family of a schoolgirl mauled to death by a pack of dogs yesterday told of their disgust that the owner is likely to escape prosecution.

Jade Lomas-Anderson’s uncle said it made him ‘sick’ that because the law on dog attacks does not cover private property, Bev Concannon will probably not face court.

‘Can everyone spread the word we want justice over these dogs and the owners so this cannot happen again,’ ‘Tucker’ Lomas, 29, wrote on Facebook.

Jade, who celebrated her 14th birthday just over a fortnight ago, is the sixth child killed by dogs in homes since 2007.

Anger: 'Tucker' Lomas said it made him 'sick' that current dog laws mean that Bev Concannon, left, will probably escape criminal charges over the death of his niece Jade Lomas-Anderson, right

Ministers have unveiled plans to extend the Dangerous Dogs Act to cover attacks on private property even if they do not involve banned breeds, but have yet to give a timetable for changing the law.

Mr Lomas added: ‘This news is making me sick, saying the owners of these dogs might not be prosecuted because it was a private property. Disgusts me. We want justice for Jade.’

Jade’s mother Shirley Lomas-Anderson, 36, also took to Facebook to pay tribute to her ‘golden ray of sunshine’.

She wrote: ‘Our beautiful princess – you’re a daughter who’s so cherished and perfect who means more than words can say.’

Police are investigating a posting by a ‘troll’ apparently mocking Jade’s death.

The message by ‘Jake Williams’ said: ‘I’m upset she didn’t get raped/murdered; judging by her pics she deserves it.’

As a post-mortem examination confirmed that Jade died of multiple injuries, mother-of-five Miss Concannon, 44, was in hiding. Friends feared she was facing a ‘lynch mob’.

Jade, a keen dancer and fan of One Direction, was staying with Miss Concannon’s 16-year-old daughter Kimberley at their home in Atherton, near Wigan, when she was savaged on Tuesday afternoon.

Friends said she had warmed a meat pie.

The dogs, understood to be two bull mastiffs and two Staffordshire bull terriers, were shot dead by police.

Miss Concannon has not been seen on the Hag Fold estate since the tragedy and her home has been boarded up.

A sign on the gate reads: ‘Beware of the dog – enter at your own risk.’

Neighbours said the dogs used to terrify passing children by jumping up at the fence, snarling and barking, but police said no residents had complained to them or other agencies.

Miss Concannon, who was out shopping at the time of the attack, is said to be ‘distraught’ and co-operating with police.

One friend, Jayne ‘Pandora’ Acton, wrote on Facebook that Miss Concannon was ‘petrified because of muppets going for her to harm her’.

She went on: ‘You are all talking about the dogs being dangerous and I have just read there are lynch mobs looking for her.

‘They are just as bad as the dogs, now leave it to the police.

‘We know it’s not right what has happened to Jade, and it could have been one of her own children, don’t forget.’

Danielle Cain wrote: ‘Bev took this dog in after it had a bad start with a bad family. She took care of her dogs.

‘It’s an absolutely terrible thing what’s happened to Jade but if she was a burglar or something we would all be saying good on the dog!’

Alan Leake, 46, the father of two of Miss Concannon’s children, Rebecca, 24, and Anthony, 20, claimed she was no longer on speaking terms with them or her parents.

Police are continuing to investigate Jade’s death and have insisted that a prosecution has not been ruled out.

Superintendent Mark Kenny of Greater Manchester Police said: ‘I want to make it clear that we have made absolutely no decision on whether any prosecutions will be brought.’
