Dyslexia is a meaningless label sought out by middle-class parents who fear their children being branded stupid or lazy, an academic has claimed.

Professor Julian Elliott, an educational psychologist and former special needs teacher, said it is clear that some children do have genuine, complex reading problems.

However, the definition of dyslexia is so broad that it is impossible to make any meaningful separation from other poor readers. And trying to do so is a ‘pointless’ waste of resources – because the same techniques help both groups of children improve their reading.

Professor Julian Elliot of Durham University has claimed dyslexia is a meaningless label sought out by middle-class parents who fear their child being branded stupid

The
 Durham University professor described dyslexia as a ‘useless term’ that
 should be abandoned.

Rather than putting children though expensive and 
lengthy diagnostic tests, schools should focus on identifying early on 
those who struggle to read and treat all of those with problems equally.

However,
 charities disputed his claims and said a diagnosis of dyslexia has 
scientific and educational value. The British Dyslexia Association 
estimates that 10 per cent of Britons have dyslexia, or word blindness, 
and have trouble learning to spell, read and write.

The professor says the definition of dyslexia is so broad it does not allow for the separation between suffering from the condition and just being a poor reader

While children 
diagnosed with the condition can get more individual teaching help and 
extra time on exams, Professor Elliott claims that their parents also 
benefit from the ‘pseudo-medical’ label.

Diagnoses tend to be found 
in more affluent areas and he argues that some middle-class parents seek
 it out because they fear their children will be judged slow or lazy.

‘Most
 parents are delighted with the label,’ said the professor. 
‘Professionals have said to me that they agree but they still use the 
term because they make people happy.’

He also argues that the 
definition of dyslexia is so broad that it is meaningless. ‘You have a 
long list of symptoms, things like anxiety when reading out loud, but 
any kid that is learning to read might be expected to show some 
anxiety,’ says Professor Elliott. ‘You show a parent this list and they 
say, “You are right, I didn’t realise my kid was dyslexic.”

‘It is like showing someone a horoscope, they look at it and see bits of themselves in it.’

Professor
 Elliott added that while parents may only want the best for their 
children, they are being ‘woefully misled about the value of a dyslexia 
diagnosis’.

In 2009, the Commons Science and Technology Committee 
inquiry into literacy concluded that the definition of dyslexia was too 
broad to be meaningful.

The influential committee of MPs also accused
 the Government of ‘bowing to pressure from the dyslexia lobby’ when 
formulating its educational policy.

Professor Elliott said: 'Diagnoses tend to be found in more affluent areas, it is quite clear that it isn't found a much in disadvantaged areas. Most parents are delighted with the diagnosis'

But Dr John Rack, of the charity Dyslexia Action, said that the term ‘has value both scientifically and educationally’.

‘We
 don’t accept the argument that it is wasteful to try to understand the 
different reasons why different people struggle,’ he said. ‘And for very
 many, those reasons fall into a consistent and recognisable pattern 
that it is helpful to call dyslexia.

‘Helpful for individuals because
 it makes sense out of past struggles and helpful for teachers who can 
plan the way they teach, to overcome or find ways around the particular 
blocks that are there.’
