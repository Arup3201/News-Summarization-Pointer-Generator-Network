Unhappy: School headteacher Dan Philpotts has criticised the sweet shop for opening at 7.30am

A headmaster today criticised a sweet shop which opens at 7.30am on weekdays - because it is leaving his pupils ‘hyperactive’ in class.

Parents have been asked to stop their children visiting the shop in Radcliffe-on-Trent on the way to school after it emerged some students were spending their dinner money on sweets.

South Nottinghamshire Academy principal Dan Philpotts, 40, hit out after the Sweet Cottage opened 1,300ft (400m) from the school gates less than two weeks ago on February 28.

The married father-of-two said the shop - which opens from 7.30am to 4.30pm on Monday to Friday - is causing some pupils to become ‘disruptive’ because they are high on sugar.

Mr Philpotts added: ‘This has escalated out of control. It’s crazy. I am just looking out for what is best for our pupils. There hasn’t been one specific incident that sparked this.

‘But students have been coming in late, and just generally becoming hyperactive and causing disruption. The shop is not prepared to acknowledge the effect it is having.’

The headmaster, a former Wolverhampton Wanderers youth footballer, insisted that he wanted to continue working with the shop, but it would carry on opening at 7.30am each day.

He continued: ‘We are asking parents to speak with their children about being sensible with their sugar intake and how they spend their dinner money.

Letter: Mr Philpotts wrote to parents of South Nottinghamshire Academy pupils to warn them about the shop

‘We will continue to inform and work with parents to avoid any unnecessary disruption during school hours which impacts on pupils’ behaviours and learning.’

Since the shop opened, teachers have reported pupils coming in with stained mouths and hands from the sweets they were buying and then eating.

But the owner of the Sweet Cottage hit back, saying children have always taken sweets to school. 

He said: ‘When I was a kid I always took a bag of sweets to school. The headteacher was not invited to come to the shop, he came of his own accord and he upset customers.

'Working with parents': The school caters for 520 pupils aged 11 to 18 and has been rated 'good' by Ofsted

‘It is just a coincidence that we open at 7.30am. We are not trying to entice schoolchildren in - and we will be opening at the same time during school holidays.’

In his letter to parents, which was sent out last Friday, Mr Philpotts urged parents to back the school’s unofficial boycott.

It stated: ‘It is important to note that, as an academy, and in our role in loco parentis to your children, we do not object to sweets per se.

‘But we do object to students filling up on sweets before the school day has even started.’

The school caters for 520 pupils aged 11 to 18 and was rated ‘good’ by watchdog Ofsted in its last inspection two years ago.
