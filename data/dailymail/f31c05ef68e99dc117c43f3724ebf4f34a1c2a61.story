A gentler side of Billy the Kid can be seen in a rare new picture to emerge of the legendary Western outlaw.

Respected forensic artist Louis Gibson, who previously identified the sailor kissing the nurse in the famous V-J Day picture taken in Times Square, has studied the latest image and says it is indeed the Kid, born Henry McCarty. 

Gibson bases her opinion on several striking similarities between this photo and the only authenticated picture of the Kid, and says the head shape and hair are the same, as well as his signature pinky ring and crooked teeth. 

Put together: A new photo purporting to show Billy the Kid (left) has emerged. The only verified picture of the Western outlaw was sold to billionaire William Koch in 2011 for $2.3million

Owner: The latest picture is owned by Billy the Kid collector Ray John de Aragon, whose grandmother allegedly treated the outlaw as a medicine woman

The only verified picture of Billy the Kid was sold in 2011 to billionaire William Koch, and shows the gunslinger leaning against his rifle in a cocky stance.   

'I think he went out, had some booze, partied with some saloon girls and just got wild,' Gibson told the Houston Chronicle, of the original image. The latest picture shows 'progression of his personality, he looks really shy in this (new) photo, he looks like he had a transformation'.

If the picture goes to auction, it could fetch several thousand dollars. 

However, some experts are suspicious about the picture's origins, since it is currently owned by Kid-collector Ray John de Aragon, a man who routinely brings out pictures claiming they show the outlaw. 

De Aragon says his grandmother was a medicine woman who knew and treated Billy the Kid, and that he came upon the picture through a friend of his father's who was once close with the subject. 

He says it's an  'old family picture of Billy the Kid'. 

Gibson will get no share of the profits if the photo is sold at auction. She was paid just $750 for her work analyzing the photo. 

While there is only one authenticated picture of Billy the Kid, this isn't the first time someone has come forward with a photo of the gunslinger. 

Last year, historian Frank Parrish claimed to have found a picture of Billy with friend  Dan Dedrick. 

Billy the Kid was a wanted outlaw in the American frontier of the late 1800s. He was born to Irish immigrants in Manhattan, but eventually found his way West to New Mexico where he descended into criminality and killed his first man at the age of 18. 

According to popular legend, Billy the Kid killed 21 men, one for each year of his short life. But the reality is probably somewhere between four and nine. 

He was shot dead in 1881, after New Mexico's governor put a price of $5,000 on his head.

Another picture of the Kid surfaced last year, showing him (right) with friend Dan Dedrick (left)
