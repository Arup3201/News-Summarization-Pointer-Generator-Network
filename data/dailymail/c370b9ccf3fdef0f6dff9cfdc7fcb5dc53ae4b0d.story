Casting an arm behind the Queen can sometimes lead to crabby looks from courtiers.

So spare a thought for this shop manager as she guides Her Majesty into a family-run seaside fish market today.

From some angles, it might appear she caught the fabric of the monarch’s cerise coat as they walked side by side during the Queen’s visit to Newhaven, East Sussex.

Faux pas: Shop manager Kerry Bickerstaff appeared to touch the Queen as she escorted her inside West Quay Fisheries in Newhaven, East Sussex

Mistake? Friends of the woman photographed here, Kerry Bickerstaff, 37, insist hers was only an instinctive and caring gesture as she shepherded the Queen, 87, along the street

According to centuries-old protocol, the Queen should not be touched in any way beyond a polite handshake.

Who can forget the furore when former 
Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating touched her lower back with his 
arm as he attempted to guide her gently through the crowd back in 1992?

That helped to earn him the unfortunate nickname of ‘Lizard of Oz.’

Then there was that incident with 
Louis Garneau, a former cycling champion, who casually placed his arm 
around the Queen’s shoulders for a snapshot taken by his wife during a 
royal tour of Canada in 2002, leading to disapproving splutters from 
veteran courtiers.

But in fact while aides eyebrows can 
sometimes be raised when such ‘rules’ are breached, the Queen’s never 
are - and she accepts that people do get excited when they meet her.

He has shown no signs of slowing down with his royal duties despite recent health scares.

But it appears that at 92, Prince Philip could finally be feeling his age.

He was seen looking a little strained as he accompanied the Queen on their royal visit to East Sussex yesterday.

Philip spent the summer recovering from abdominal surgery in June but was soon back to work and carrying out engagements.

In any case, friends of the woman 
photographed here, Kerry Bickerstaff, 37, insist hers was only an 
instinctive and caring gesture as she shepherded the Queen, 87, along 
the street.

‘She crooked her arm round behind her back as is natural and anyone would - and she didn’t touch the Queen,’ said one.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 
‘She did not touch the Queen, and even if she had done the Queen would 
have taken no offence.’

Indeed, the Queen accepts that people do get excited when they meet her – and it is her aides who are much more likely to raise eyebrows when such 'rules' are breached.

arm around Michelle Obama’s waist at a Buckingham Palace G20 reception, 
prompting the U.S. President’s wife to return the gesture and rub her 
shoulder.

Downs to look at their new facilities - including 'glamping' pods

MARCH 2012 Left, The Queen wore the pink outfit on 8 March last year when she spent the day with Kate in Leicester

MAY 2012 The outfit came out again 2012 when she attended a Mad Hatters tea party in Sherbourne, Dorset

The sight of the Queen publicly 
hugging another woman astonished other guests.

It was the first time 
that anyone could remember in her long public life that she has put her 
arm around another woman.

The Palace called it ‘a mutual and spontaneous display of affection and appreciation.’

On the subject of protocol, the 
Buckingham Palace website says: ‘The Queen meets thousands of people 
each year in the UK and overseas.

Looking good: Both the Queen and the Duke appeared to be in good spirits as they made their appearance

‘Before meeting Her Majesty, many 
people ask how they should behave. The simple answer is that there are 
no obligatory codes of behaviour - just courtesy.’

Today the Queen was one her way into West Quay Fisheries, which has been open for almost 40 years, when the near miss happened.

Inside, she and the Duke of Edinburgh 
were shown more than 40 varieties of fish caught by a local fleet 
including crab, lobsters, monk fish, conger eel and squid.

Mrs Bickerstaff said: 'It’s an honour.
We had the Duke of Kent about 10 years ago but I have never met the 
Queen before. It’s great news for the community to have her here.'

Grand opening: The Queen unveiled the plaque at the YSA before moving on to tour other parts of East Sussex

They also got a taste of 
Glastonbury-style ‘glamping’ when they viewed the upmarket wooden 
camping pods at a new £5 million 68-bed youth hostel in the South Downs 
National Park.

When Allison Green, YHA’s operations 
director, asked Philip, 92, if he was having a good visit, he replied: 
‘Well, it depends what’s a good visit but I’m unlikely to tell you I’m 
having a bad one.’

Their engagements today also included a
visit to Harvey’s Brewery in Lewes - where the Duke’s expression was 
equally stoic as they got out of their car on arrival.

Meanwhile, the Queen's thrifty 
instinct was seen today as she made a third public appearance in a 
favourite cerise and black ensemble she wore twice during last year's 
Jubilee celebrations.

Stiff: The Duke of Edinburgh appears a little stiff as he emerges from the car outside the West Quay Fisheries

The monarch wore the Angela Kelly 
designed pink cashmere coat and dress during today's visit to Lewes, 
where she and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the YHA before continuing to
Newhaven.

The outfit first appeared in March 2012 when she wore the ensemble on a visit to Leicester with the Duchess of Cambridge.

Two months later, the ensemble reappeared during a Diamond Jubilee visit to a Mad Hatter's tea party in Sherbourne.

The local community has been mourning 
the loss this week of 14-year-old Dylan Alkins who was swept out to sea 
while playing in the surf at Newhaven on Sunday afternoon.

Knowledgeable: According to Newhaven locals, Prince Phillip knows his stuff about brewing

Among the guests at the fish market to
meet the Queen and Philip were coastguards and RNLI crew involved in 
the attempt to rescue Dylan amid atrocious weather conditions as the St 
Jude storm swept in.

Despite extensive efforts to find him,
Dylan’s body has not been recovered, devastating his parents who have 
described him as an 'amazing boy'.

Ian Bickerstaff, 59, the owner of the 
fish firm, said he was enormously proud to welcome the Queen and Philip,
but said the loss of Dylan had placed a cloud over the town.

He said: 'It’s a privilege for me and my girls, as it’s a family-run business, and it’s our 40th year next year.

'The only sad thing is there is a 
cloud over the town with the loss of the young boy this week. We all 
send our condolences to his family because he’s the same age as my own 
son.'
