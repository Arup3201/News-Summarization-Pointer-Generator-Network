This video shows the dramatic moment an Audi driver drove on the wrong side of the road so they could get over a level crossing before the barriers came down.

Seeing the red flashing lights, the motorist sped up along the road with a pedestrian dodging out of the way to avoid being hit.

As the first barriers come down, the driver weaves across the road and onto the tracks before swerving back onto their side of the road and driving off.

Reckless: An Audi driver, seen approaching this level crossing, risked lives by speeding across the train track as the barriers come down

Danger: The unnamed driver ignores the flashing red lights, which indicate the barriers will come down to allow the train to pass

Risky: The lights were flashing for more than 15 seconds, but the daredevil speeds up to risk their life by swerving in a high-speed manouevre

The moment was captured on CCTV at the Mount Pleasant level crossing in the Northam part Southampton, Hampshire.

The footage has been released by Network Rail as the organisation continues with a nationwide programme of closing level crossings.

Sharon Vye-Parminter safety director for the Network Rail and South West Trains Alliance, runs the railway in Hampshire.

She said: 'We are committed to improving safety on what is already a very safe railway and we are always looking at ways to make level crossings safer.

'However, as this footage shows, there are still people out there who are prepared to put lives in danger.

'Closing level crossings is one way that we can reduce to the risk to the railway, but we also need the help of the public.'

Nine level crossings in Hampshire and Surrey have been closed since 2010 while audible alarms, which announce when a train is approaching, have been fitted at eight crossings.

The work is part of Network Railâ€™s nationwide crossings improvement programme, which will see 10 per cent of the countryâ€™s crossings closed by April.

The organisation says closing the crossings will reduce the overall risk level posted by crossings by 25 per cent.

The 130 million pounds programme has also seen some crossings fitted with red lights to dissuade motorists from jumping lights.

A total of 100 new level crossing managers have been employed and footbridges have been erected to replace 38 crossings.

And another 500 crossings are set to close in the next five years, with a full list expected to be announced in April.
