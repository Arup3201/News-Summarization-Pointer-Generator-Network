A man seeking to clear his name in a famous child molestation case has successfully petitioned a New York judge to release 25-year-old documents used in his prosecution.

Lawyers working on behalf of Jesse Friedman, whose conviction was highlighted in the 2003 Oscar-nominated documentary 'Capturing the Friedmans,' want to review grand jury testimony and transcripts of witness interviews.

'Every aspect, every part, every piece of paper generated in the matter of People V. Friedman' will be released to Jesse Friedman's defense team, state Supreme Court Judge F. Dana Winslow ordered following a brief hearing.

He gave Nassau County prosecutors 
until Tuesday to provide the defense team with grand jury testimony and 
transcripts of witness interviews, stemming from the notorious case.

The
prosecutors said they intend to appeal Winslow's order, they had 
opposed the release, citing concerns about victims' privacy. 

'After
more than two decades, several guilty pleas, a complete appeal process,
and a full and independent re-investigation, the victims in this case 
deserve closure and privacy,' said Shams Tarek, a spokesman for District
Attorney Kathleen Rice.

'We
are disappointed by the decision and will absolutely be appealing and 
expecting to prevail on behalf of the victims in a higher court.'

In June the DA's office had issued a 
155-page report that reiterated that Friedman's original conviction in 
1988 had been proper and correct.

Friedman
was just 19 years old when he and his father Arnold were jailed for allegedly molesting children who attended their after school 
computer class in Great Neck, New York.

Jesse Friedman served 13 years in prison and was released in 2001. Now married and living in Bridgeport, Connecticut, he has been trying for more than a decade to clear his name.

The documentary about the Friedman’s case – and the inconsistencies in the 
evidence against them – was released in 2002. Directed by Andrew 
Jarecki, ‘Capturing the Friedmans’ was nominated for the Academy Award 
for Documentary Feature in 2003.

'This ruling is an attempt to correct a fraudulent report that was based upon false information that the DA knew was fraudulent,' said Jarecki following Thursday's decision by Winslow.

The Friedman case has drawn 
comparisons to the 1980s California McMartin preschool scandal involving
allegations of sex abuse, but the investigators in their June report 
said the two cases 'were in no way similar.'

Winslow
on Thursday was particularly critical of a portion of the DA's report 
that claimed Jesse Friedman, while in prison in 2000, had written 
"fictional" stories that described violent and disturbing sexual acts, 
including incest involving a father and his children, sex with a dog and
child rape.

Prosecutors also said he had been disciplined for possessing a photograph of 2 pre-pubescent girls - at least 1 of whom was naked - torn from the pages of a magazine in violation of the terms of his sex offender counseling program.

Defense attorney Ronald Kuby has maintained that Friedman was acquitted of those prison charges; a claim that an assistant district attorney reluctantly confirmed Thursday.

'We can't function in the justice system in this fashion,' the judge said in a scathing rebuke. 'This is a country that has no feeling of credibility when it comes to our institutions.'

Since
his release from prison in 2001, Friedman has been registered as a 
Level 3 sex offender which continues to prevent him from leading a 
normal life and prevents him from living near schools, playgrounds, 
day-care centers, and houses of worship.

The
nightmare for Jesse Friedman began in November 1987 after his father 
Arnold received a child pornography magazine in the mail from the 
Netherlands. 

Authorities were alerted and when they searched the Friedman home they found a stash of 20 magazines containing child porn.

After learning that Arnold Friedman taught a computer class to children aged eight-to-10-year-old from his home, local police began to suspect him of abusing his students.

Jesse helped his father run the computer classes and so he too became a suspect.

Initially
detectives didn't find much evidence, but after some of the children 
were interviewed as many as 15 times they began to speak out about 
alleged abuse.

Some children started to claim that Friedman had played bizarre sex games with them during their computer classes.

Other
claims strained credibility, one student would have had to have been 
molested an average of six times during every one of the 20 90-minute 
classes they took if their allegation was true.

However
with a witch-hunt brewing, Arnold and Jesse were charged with hundreds 
of counts of sodomy, sexual abuse, and employing a minor in an obscene 
performance.

Initially they fought the charges, but as prosecutors added hundreds of new charges Arnold decided he had no choice but to plead guilty since the only physical evidence in the case was his collection of child porn.

According to the family he confessed in the hopes that his son would be spared prison time.

Police also accused Jesse's friend Ross Goldstein of joining the Friedmans' molestation. Faced with 118 charges against him, 17-year-old Goldstein admitting that he and Jesse had abused kids.

In exchange for this testimony he was promised six months in jail and a cleansed record upon his release, but after testifying before the grand jury he was sentenced to two-to-six years in prison.

Facing life in prison, Jesse decided he had no choice but to cut his own deal.

Then aged 19 he pleaded guilty to sexually abusing 14 children in his father's home computer class and was sentenced to 18 years in prison. The court never heard from a witness or saw any evidence.

Terrified
of what awaited him in prison as a child molester, Jesse undertook some
misguided damage-control. He gave an interview to Geraldo Rivera, 
inventing a story of his own abuse at the hands of his father.

Once in prison, Jesse reverted to maintaining his innocence - a position that led to being denied parole four times.

He was eventually released from prison in 2001 after serving 13 years of his sentence, while he father committed suicide in prison in 1995 by taking a massive overdose of antidepressant.

In 2004, Friedman’s lawyers filed a motion arguing that newly available evidence warranted reopening the case.

Successive courts rejected the appeal until
2010, when a federal appeals court took the unusual step and urged 
prosecutors to reopen the case, saying that Friedman may have been 
wrongfully convicted.

The decision cited 'overzealousness' by law enforcement officials swept up in the hysteria over child molestation in the 1980s. The ruling noted that 'the quality of the evidence was extraordinarily suspect.'

Taken
together, the court said, 'the record here suggests "a reasonable 
likelihood" that Jesse Friedman was wrongfully convicted.'

The
DA's investigation took nearly three years to compile, but when it was released in June it wasn't the verdict that Friedman had been hoping for.

The report not only affirmed 
Friedman's conviction, but 'added critical context, and in some cases 
supplied refuting evidence' to dis-spell theories put forward by Friedman and 
his advocates.

Unperturbed by the DA's report, Friedman and his lawyers have continued to fight and will be hoping that the release 25-year-old documents used in his prosecution all those years ago will provide hope.
