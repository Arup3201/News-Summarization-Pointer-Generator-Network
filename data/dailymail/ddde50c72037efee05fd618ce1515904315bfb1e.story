A Houston, Texas mom hammed it up for her mugshot when she was arrested for drunkenly dropping her infant last month, but she won't find the next six months in prison so funny.

Sandra Luann Grohmann, of suburban Humble was handed a 180 sentence on Monday after pleading guilty to charges of endangering the welfare of a child.

The 29-year-old was arrested on April 22 around 6pm when a passerby saw her knock the 4-weeks-old child from a stroller on the side of S Houston Ave - a busy roadway.

What's so funny? Sandra Luann Grohmann, 29, was sentenced to 180 days in prison after pleading guilty to charges of endangering the welfare of a child on Monday. She was arrested last month after a witness saw her drop her 1-month-old baby on the side of a busy road

Cops arrived on the scene to find Grohmann drunk and under the influence of prescription medicine.

Paramedics determined the child was not hurt, and the infant was put in the protection of social workers.

Humble Police Detective Sergeant Mike Flynt described in detail the incident that happened on a Tuesday.

'The witnesses saw Grohmann pushing the stroller about five feet away from the roadway when she fell for the first time partially knocking her unrestrained child out of the stroller,' Sgt Flynt said. 

'She then tried to get back up and put the baby back in the stroller when she fell again causing the baby to fall all the way out of the stroller and roll into the grass. She then tried to get back up, falling for the third time,' he added.

Grohmann was arrested at the scene and taken to Harris County Jail where she was held on $2,000 bail.
