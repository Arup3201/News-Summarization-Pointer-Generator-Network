Former England footballer Stan Collymore has hit out at Twitter for failing to act against internet trolls tweeting racist and sexist abuse - and even death threats.

The star, now a pundit on Talksport radio, claims the web giant has not done enough to crack down on the vile messages he has received from trolls as young as 10 years old.

Staffordshire Police are now investigating the threats after Mr Collymore passed on the tweets to officers - but Twitter has refused to comment on the case, saying that users can report abuse whenever it occurs.

Outspoken: Stan Collymore has accused Twitter of not doing enough to tackle racist and abusive messages

The ex-Liverpool striker, who also played for Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa, claims he has repeatedly been subjected to online racism since joining Twitter.

Yesterday he tweeted: 'I accuse Twitter directly of not doing enough to combat racist/homophobic/sexist hate messages, all of which are illegal in the UK.

'In the last 24 hours I've been threatened with murder several times, demeaned on my race, and many of these accounts are still active. Why?'

The 43-year-old then shared a number of appalling messages he was sent after criticising Liverpool striker Luis Suarez, with some web users calling him the N-word and using offensive racial stereotypes.

Claims: Mr Collymore has repeatedly been targeted by racist trolls and has even received death threats

Appearing on BBC1's Breakfast programme this morning, Mr Collymore said: 'The age user range of Twitter has gone down dramatically.

'I am seeing gangs of kids from 10 to 18 goaded by adults to make racist and homophobic and sexist insults on Twitter, so Twitter need to deal with it. It's quite horrific.

'Today's my birthday and I would rather not be here but I am going to try to talk about this issue. Nothing seems to be done. Twitter are now hiding behind, "We don't discuss individual cases."

'If it's illegal I reserve the right as a United Kingdom citizen to live within the laws of the United Kingdom, and so should Twitter.'

Asked how he responded to the abusive messages, the ex-footballer said: 'I retweet, I report, I block and if it is sufficiently threatening, I will go to the police.

Abuse: Police have launched an investigation over this message, which Mr Collymore retweeted to his followers

Call to action: Mr Collymore has received dozens of messages of support from his followers

'I have been on it for six years now and it's a fantastic tool to engage in my sport, football, with fans.

'If you disagree with a point that I make it's absolutely fine. But I shouldn't be racially abused for it, I shouldn't have somebody that tweets me two days ago saying I am going to turn up at your house and murder you.'

When Mr Collymore appeared on BBC News today, a presenter suggested that trolls had targeted him because he had 'been on the wrong side of the law' in the past.

The star hit back against that claim, saying: 'I've never been convicted of anything other than speeding, so maybe you'd like to retract that.'

The ex-footballer's personal life frequently made headlines during his career - he broke up with TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson after punching her in a bar, and was once caught dogging - but he has never been implicated in a crime.

He added: 'Regardless of what the perception of me as a character is, I have the right to be able to walk down the road, and if someone calls me the N-word to be able to report it and get it to dealt with. I would expect that I should be accorded the same courtesy on Twitter.'

Broadcaster Piers Morgan also 
received a stream of abuse after he stood up for Mr Collymore and called
 for Twitter and the police to take action.

Both
 Staffordshire Police and the Police Service of Northern Ireland are now
 investigating the allegedly racist tweets, one of which was sent by a 
user in Dungannon, Co Tyrone.

'We've
 been in contact with Mr Collymore to get more information and to 
reassure him that we will carry out a thorough and detailed 
investigation,' a spokesman for Staffordshire Police said.

'Such behaviour is completely unacceptable and we all have a shared responsibility to treat each other with dignity and respect.

'Our investigation into previous alleged offences is continuing and we are currently liaising with Twitter to obtain subscriber details.'

A spokesman for Twitter said that the company had a policy of refusing to comment on any individual cases.

But she pointed out that abusive messages are against the rules of the site, and claimed that it had recently made it easier for users to report concerns.

There are 'established processes' in place for working with law enforcement, the spokesman added.
