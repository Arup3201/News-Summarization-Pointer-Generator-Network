It is the first of its kind and certainly makes border crossings a lot more fun.

Spain and Portugal have been linked by a zip wire, meaning thrillseekers can cross from one country to another by flying through the air at speeds of up to 50mph.

Adrenaline junkies board in Sanlucar de Guadiana in Andalucia, Spain, before whizzing down the line and landing across the Guadiana River in Alcoutim, Portugal.

And thanks to time zone differences between the two nations, the 60 second journey will see the zipliners travel back in time one hour.

Englishman, David Jarman, who set up and created the 2,365ft zipline, said: 'I love a challenge.

'Two villages in two countries, separated by a river 150 metres wide - a zipline just seemed obvious to me.

'It also seemed like a great way to unite both places, since a bridge had been talked about for many years, but was never realised.'

Don't look down: The zipline, which costs £12 per person, reaches speeds of up to 50mph

On a busy day, the Limitzero line - called 'la tirolina' in Spain - can accommodate 24-30 people an hour, with each journey costing 15 euros (about £12).

But your stay in Portugal won't last too long.

There is a boat on hand in the picturesque village of Alcoutim to ferry zipliners back to Spain after their ride is complete.
