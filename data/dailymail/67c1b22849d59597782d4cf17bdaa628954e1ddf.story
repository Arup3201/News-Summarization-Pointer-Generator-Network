A champagne welcome, free gifts, express check-in, first class seats with extra leg-room.

These are all things you might expect to benefit from when flying away for your honeymoon.

But that was not the outcome for two newlyweds, after the groom tweeted KLM for champagne.

Happy honeymoon! Tom and Kelly are driven through Schipol Airport on a buggy with tin cans tied to the back

The couple, known only as Tom and Kelly, contacted the Dutch airline as they prepared to fly out from Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport to Tanzania.

On his Twitter feed, Tom had posted: 'Hi @KLM, is champagne available on your long-haul flights? 

'We want to start our honeymoon in style tomorrow morning!'

To which the airline responded: 'Hello Tom, we would like to see if we can assist you! We can't promiss [sic] you anything, but where are you travelling tomorrow?' 

Surprise! The newlyweds seem to enjoy the ride at Schiphol Airport, Holland

How the plan came to be, after an innocent Tweet from the husband

At the airport, the happy couple were greeted by an enthusiastic member of KLM staff who congratulated them on their honeymoon and marriage, before directing them to their 'carriage'.

She tells the couple, 'We have something amazing for you because you just got married, indicating to a buggy.

With emotive music playing the background, the airline staff takes a photo of the couple as the couple settle in for their drive. 

The tin cans attached to the back of the buggy ensure no one is going to miss this journey

Not impressed: These two tourists seem less-than-amused by the couple's 'carriage'

With an obvious, blue 'Just Married' sign and tin cans strapped to the back of the vehicle, the buggy motors through the busy airport, with passengers staring as it passes. 

Finally, the jetsetters reach their destination and the trolley parks up as the airline staff tells them: 'Have a very nice trip, enjoy your honeymoon, and if we can do anything else I'm always happy to help.' 

The 'upgrade' forms part of the #HappyToHelp programme KLM has launched on Twitter.

And for this week only, the airline has promised to help any traveller, 24 hours a day, flying on any airline if they use the hashtag on social media.

MailOnline has contacted KLM for comment.
