Michael Brown's family could sue Darren Wilson or the Ferguson Police Department over the 'flawed' decision not to indict the police officer who fatally shot the teenager.

An attorney for the Brown family said the grand jury proceedings which failed to indict Wilson, who shot the unarmed 18-year-old, left open the possibility they could pursue a civil rights case.

Daryl Parks said the use of certain words and adjectives, including 'demonic' to describe Brown, could prove a racial component in the incident and determine a civil rights violation.

He told Fox News: 'When I tell you about the words he [Wilson] used to describe Michael Brown.

'He uses demonic, demon. I don't think you have to use the actual words for it to be racial.'

He added: 'What it does is cast Michael Brown in a negative light.' 

Mr Parks said that both sides needed to be given the chance to work out their differences, but the matter could be settled with litigation if needed. 

He explained his concern with the grand jury proceedings was that Wilson should not have been allowed to present his defense. 

Michael Brown's parents, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr, appeared on CBS last week where they said they ' don't believe a word' of Darren Wilson's account of shooting dead their teenage son 

Michael Brown's father and mother, Lesley McSpadden, reacted with fury to Officer Wilson's first interview last week, saying: 'I don't think he wanted to kill my son but he wanted kill someone.' 

Michael Brown Sr said the decision not to indict Wilson reinforced to him that he was living in a 'racist state'. 

Ms McSpadden said: 'He [Wilson] says that his conscience is clear. How can your conscience be clear after killing somebody even after it was accidental death?' 

Yesterday, veteran civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton preached to a congregation of around 2,500 worshippers at the St Louis church where Michael Brown's funeral was held in August.

The dead teen's parents were among the congregation. 

But Neil Bruntager, an attorney for Wilson, said the Brown family have the right to pursue a case - but will have a 'difficult row to hoe'.

Wilson, a white police officer, shot Brown dead after an encounter in Ferguson, Missouri, in August and last week, a St Louis Country grand jury chose not to indict Wilson. 

Brown's death galvanized critics of the way police and the criminal justice system treat African-Americans and other minority groups, sparking protests and riots across the country.

On Saturday, Wilson resigned from his position amid concerns about his safety.

And yesterday, Ferguson's Mayor James Knowles vowed to rebuilt his riot-torn town.

He said: 'We are recommitted to rebuilding the city and to once again becoming a thriving community for economic development and residential stability.'
