The sinking of a cardboard Malaysia Airlines plane in a New Zealand competition has 'disgusted' the sister of a Kiwi man who was a passenger on the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 when it disappeared in March last year while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, China.

Paul Weeks was travelling on the Boeing 777 plane, carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew, that crashed into the Indian Ocean. It has still not been found.

Stuff.co.nz reported that Weeks' sister Sara felt it was bad enough that someone used the idea for the annual Tata Beach Titanic Cup for 'humour', but even worse that the competition judges awarded it the best sinking prize.

A cardboard Malaysia Airlines plane starts to sink into Golden Bay during the annual Tata Beach Titanic Cup

Paul Weeks was one of the 239 people reported missing after the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 last March

The premise of the Titanic Cup, which took place at Golden Bay at the northwest end of New Zealand's South Island, is to win the cardboard boat race. But there was also a prize for the most dramatic sinking, which the cardboard Malaysia Airlines plane won.

'I'm gobsmacked,' Ms Weeks from Christchurch said. 'It hasn't even been a year. What if it was his family member on the plane? He [the entrant] wouldn't find it funny.'

Event organiser Dave Myall admitted the boat depicting the sinking MH370 was controversial but 'artistic merit was the overriding consideration'.

The cardboard Malaysia Airlines entry was the best sinking competition winner

He stood by the three judges' decision. Such entries were par for an event with 'Titanic' in its title.

'At what point does a tragedy become safe to refer to? One of the ways to deal with it is humour,' he told Stuff.co.nz.

'I'm sorry to hear about the woman (Sara Weeks) and her misfortune, but this was a very local event. It needs to be taken in context. If the media outside of Nelson hadn't got involved, there would be no complaint.' 

Event organiser Dave Myall admitted the boat depicting the sinking MH370 was on the risque side

The best sinking competition winner received a scenic flight voucher – 'which in itself is ironic', Myall said.

Robert Chubb, of Golden Bay, was the man behind creating the cardboard Malaysia Airlines plane. he said that he believed enough time had passed since the MH370 tragedy for people to see the humour instead of taking offence. 

The memory of Mr Weeks (pictured) had been disrespected by the crude display his sister Sara said 

Ms Weeks called the entry 'tasteless and offensive'.

'I'm just appalled. I don't think I'll ever find that funny,' she said. 'To make it first prize, I'm quite surprised.'
