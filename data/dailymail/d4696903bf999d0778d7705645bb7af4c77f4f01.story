A charity bookkeeper stole more than $800,000 meant for veterans and spent it on holidays, internet shopping, and gifts for her family, according to police.

Cynthia Tanner worked for the National Veterans Services Fund (NVSF) in Darien, Connecticut, taking care of staff payroll and handing out cheques to help veterans in need.

But officers allege the 52-year-old used her position to write out cheques totalling $830,000 over five years, which she then cashed herself or gave to relatives.

Cynthia Tanner, 52, has been charged with first degree larceny after police say she embezzled $830,000 of charity money and spent it on car loans, shopping and holidays

She was arrested after an audit at NVSF uncovered irregularities in the accounts, and appeared in court yesterday accused of writing 135 cheques totalling $185,000 - which prosecutors say is the amount stolen in 2013 alone.

According to the affidavit, Tanner made seven payments for car loans totalling nearly $3,500, wrote 16 cheques to her 23-year-old daughter totaling $42,525, and 17 checks to her 25-year-old son totaling 
$19,925.

Police say she changed entries in the charity's financial records to make it look as if the payments had gone to veterans, while actually pocketing the money.

Tanner was charged with first degree larceny, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in jail and $15,000 in fines, at Stamford Superior Court.

She was remanded in custody on a $500,000 bail to appear again on June 30.

Tanner worked at the National Veterans Services Fund (pictured) and was in charge of payroll and handing out cheques to the needy. Police claim she used her position to pocket money for herself

According to NBC Connecticut Tanner had worked for NVSF since 2008, a charity organisation which handed out welfare cheques to retired servicemen and women in need.

They money was used to pay for mobility scooters, access ramps, utility bills, snow tyres and vet's bills for veterans' companion animals across the country.

The Connecticut Post reported that Tanner claimed she took advances from the charity, but had paid all the money back.

She also claimed she was liable to forget things after having brain surgery, but when told the allegations date from before the operation, she went quiet.

A statement from the charity said that it is still in operation and reassured donors that any money given will be safe.
