Seven adults and a child were killed when lightning struck a Seventh Day Adventist church in Malawi.

The bolt struck the building, in the capital city of Lilongwe, at 4.30pm on Saturday while the church was full of worshippers at prayer.

An official from the Malawian ministry of health said that the eight victims were already dead by the time they arrived at Kamuzu Central hospital in the city.

A further 40 people were said to have been treated at the hospital, one of whom is now in intensive care.

Charles Mwansambo, chief of health services at the Malawian ministry of health, said: 'The worshippers were having an extended session of Saturday prayers when lightning struck their church at around 4.30pm.

'It's a disaster... it was a natural phenomenon.'

A witness interviewed by the Nyasa Times newspaper newspaper described a 'stampede' which followed the powerful burst of electricity.

The witness said: ''People were inside the church attending the service when the lightning struck,. I first head a loud burst which frightened almost everybody and a few minutes later I just saw a stampede here.'

December is the first month of the rainy season in Malawi, in which storms and high humidity are common. According to local media reports, three other people have been killed by lightning strikes in the past month.
