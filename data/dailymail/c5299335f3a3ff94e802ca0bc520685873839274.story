When Andrew Cadigan's mate Chris Simpson died of myelodysplasia in 2011, the carpenter from New South Wales spent 18 months walking around the coast of Australia to raise money for cancer research.

But in a cruel twist of fate, the 31-year-old suffered severe head injuries in a motorbike accident just one month after completing his 15,000km walk and raising $65,000 for the Cancer Council and Leukaemia Foundation, dying three months later.

That's how his devastated father, Neil Cadigan, found himself hosting annual walks for cancer charities two years later and turning the detailed diary his son wrote during his 350 day adventure into a novel titled With Every Step.

Andrew Cadigan died just 12 weeks after he walked 15,000km around Australia over 350 days to raise $65,000 for the Cancer Council and Leukaemia Foundation

'While I was sitting by his [hospital] bedside, I started to read his diary and decided that because there was so much depth to his diaries, that I would turn it into a book,' Mr Cadigan told Daily Mail Australia.

'He had died while preparing to write the book and I made a vow that I was going to complete the task for him.'

Mr Cadigan said he was left in awe after flicking through the personal notes from his son's trip.

Starting in Sydney, Andrew had walked down to Melbourne and across to Hobart before continuing on around the country - right through the Kimberley's during the lead up to the wet season in which he endured over 48 degree heat while drinking up to 14 litres of water a day.

Determined to accomplish what he'd started, he even sold his own home to finance the trip. He is the third person to ever walk around the entire country solo with no accompanying tour.

But his father had no idea of the pain his son had endured.

'He fought temperatures nearly freezing when he slept in a tent in Tasmania, he dealt with plagues of locusts and mice and wild bulls in the Kimberly's,' Mr Cadigan said.

'He had times when he woke up in the morning and had blistered feet and was in pain before he started and he would still walk 60km somehow.

'In some parts of West Australia, he was so detached and isolated between towns - he would be walking for days and days and there would be virtually no civilisation - it was then in his diaries that he wrote that he felt depressed and saw a doctor who said it was the physical relentlessness of the trip.'

Accompanied by only a three-wheeler pram which carried his tent, sleeping bag and a solar panel, Andrew is only the third person to ever walk around the entire country solo with no accompanying tour

'He had times when he woke up in the morning and had blistered feet and was in pain before he started and he would still walk 60km somehow'

Accompanied by only a three-wheeler pram which carried his tent, sleeping bag and a solar panel, Andrew walked an average of 43km a day while occasionally setting himself extreme challenges such as walking 100km with no stops along the lonely Nullarbor Plain - a feat that lasted from 1am until 4:30pm the next day.

But it was the last video blog that Andrew posted on his website ozonfoot.com.au that Mr Cadigan finds the most tragic.

'Done and dusted! It's all over… day 536, but tomorrow will be day 1: getting on with the rest of my life,' Andrew filmed himself saying as he walked across the finishing line at the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

'While I was sitting by his [hospital] bedside, I started to read his diary and decided that because there was so much depth to his diaries, that I would turn it into a book,' Neil Cadigan told Daily Mail Australia

It was a month after the recording that his mother and father rushed to his hospital bedside in Thailand, where he had travelled to relax after his huge year, and 12 weeks after it that he passed away.

'It has been a very tough mourning process, listening to his voice and going through his diary for the book, reading a lot of the things he wrote that we didn't get a chance to discuss amongst ourselves and knowing that I never would be able to,' Mr Cadigan said.

'He struggled far more than I had realised, even though I spoke to him regularly, so I became in awe of that and in times when I was struggling to get through it and keep writing it I thought "no, I'm going to keep going because he did".

'He just refused to give in until he got to the finish line and that became my drive.' 

Andrew's family said they have been overwhelmed with the messages of support they have received from people all over the country who met him and became inspired by his selfless goal

All the money the proud parents continue to raise through the annual charity walks they have organised in memory of their son, will be donated to the Leukaemia Foundation which has funded a $60,000 three year research project into treatments for Leukaemia - a PHD that is named after Andrew and Chris

Andrew's family said they have been overwhelmed with the messages of support they have received from people all over the country who met him and became inspired by his goal. 

Mr Cadigan and his wife Christine now host annual charity walks in their son's memory, with Mrs Cadigan even travelling to England next year to walk the 309km Coast to Coast Walk. 

All of the money the proud parents raise through their walks will be donated to the Leukaemia Foundation which has funded a $60,000 three year research project into treatments for Myelodysplasia (MDS) - a PHD that is named after Andrew and Chris.  

'If that was to happen and they came close to finding a cure, that would be the proudest day of my life, knowing that the boys didn't die in vain,' Mr Cadigan said.
