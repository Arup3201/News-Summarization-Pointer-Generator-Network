A 13-year-old boy charged with robbing and assaulting an 11-year-old who later committed suicide has been found not guilty.

The accused boy, who has been unnamed because of his age, was acquitted today in Oshawa, Ont., on charges of assault causing bodily harm and robbery.

Police
had alleged the suspect slammed Mitchell Wilson's face and teeth into the 
sidewalk while stealing his iPhone in Pickering in November of 2010.

Acquitted: A teen accused of beating up and stealing from 11-year-old Mitchell Wilson (pictured) leading to his suicide in 2011, was acquitted from his charges today

Mitchell, who suffered from muscular dystrophy, killed himself last September, the day he was subpoenaed to testify in the case.

The Crown could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused boy - who was sent to another school following the attack - was the one who had attacked Mitchell that day.

Mitchell had produced oral and written statements identifying his attacker prior to his death, but how reliable they were was under question.

'The case law on eyewitness evidence 
consistently states that even when an eyewitness is honest and credible,
as I’m sure Mitchell Wilson would have been, these witnesses are often 
mistaken because of how the brain functions,' Justice Mary Teresa Devlin told the court Monday, according to the Toronto Star.

Bullied: Mitchell suffered from muscular dystrophy provoking attacks from local bullies who made him fearful to go to school or take the walks encouraged regularly by his doctor to get better

'I hope that one day, the youths responsible for these crimes will have 
the courage to come forward and take responsibility for their 
wrongdoing,' she said as part of her final statement before the room.

Outside the courthouse, Mitchell's family expressed their disappointment in the verdict.

'The law is the law,' said Craig Wilson, the boy's father to the Star. 'I know Mitchell was 100 per cent sure in his mind. I like to think that is the truth.'

Evidence: Written and oral testimony by Mitchell prior to his suicide was found not reliable enough by the court though the boy's father Craig Wilson says he is keeping his son's side of the story as the truth

Mitchell's grandmother Pam Wilson had earlier said that 
his family 'don't want to be a lynch squad' and are only trying to help 
the attacker have a better life.

'He's a child, just like Mitchell,' family friend Anne Oakes told the Star Monday.

Family had hoped, however, that through a guilty verdict the accused teen would have received some help or community service, making him more understanding of those with disabilities.

His father had said that it was because of his son's disability, diagnosed a year ago and three years after his mother's death from cancer, that led to his bulling at school.

Disappointment: Family of Mitchell expressed disappointment after the verdict today while his grandmother Pam Wilson earlier said they 'don't want to be a lynch squad' but hope the alleged attacker is helped for a better life

Conclusion: Concluding the trial, the court's judge said she hopes one day the boy's attackers will one day come forward and take responsibility for their crime

Realizing his inabilities to defend himself against his attacker, his father says the boy once apologized to him in embarrassment.

'He realized how weak he really was and how he was unable to defend himself. Being a young man, he was a very proud kid and the fact he couldn’t defend himself in that situation hurt his self-esteem, irreparably,' Mr Wilson said.

Doctors had told Mitchell his muscular 
dystrophy could be helped by walking outside, but he was scared of doing
this after the attack.

Mitchell was found by his father after committing suicide in his bedroom on the day he was to start at a new school.
