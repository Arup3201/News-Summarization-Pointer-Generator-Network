The hunt for missing Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 has been narrowed to the southern region of the previous search zone after a new analysis of satellite phone data.

A failed attempt at a satellite phone call from the jet 'suggests ... the aircraft might have turned south a little earlier than expected,' said Warren Truss, Australia's deputy prime minister.

It comes just weeks before the multi-million dollar, year-long sonar hunt for wreckage is due to begin. 

The overall search area still remained unchanged, Mr Truss said. He did not explain how the southern area was singled out.

However, Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Martin Dolan said he would meet with international experts next week to decide whether the 60,000 square kilometre (23,000 square mile) targeted search area should be extended or shifted further south based on the new analysis.

'We think we may extend that area farther south; that's the thing we're currently considering,' he said.

The new analysis applies to satellite data from the first of two satellite phone calls Malaysia Airlines ground staff attempted to make to Flight 370's crew.

By the time the calls were attempted, the plane had become invisible to civilian radar. It had flown west without communications past Sumatra and beyond the range of Malaysian military radar.

Mr Dolan said the new analysis suggested the jet was already flying south when the first phone call was attempted less than 20 minutes after the plane dropped off military radar.

'Previously, there was the possibility that it could have been quite a bit later, so we had to do our modelling based on a range of possibilities as to where the aircraft turned,' he said.

Malaysian transport minister Liow Tiong Lai and Australian deputy prime minister Warren Truss today signed a memorandum of understanding sharing the ongoing costs of the search for the missing Boeing 777

'We're now more confident that it turned comparatively early. That does make a difference to how we prioritise the search along the seventh arc,' he added, referring to the area where satellite information from a jet engine transmitter suggests the plane ran out of fuel and crashed.

Investigators have long been aware of the phone call. But they have only recently adapted analysis methodology to glean clues to the plane's direction from the satellite phone data.

MH370 disappeared on March 8 after flying far off course from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. 

Officials say the investigation into the how it crashed can only proceed once its wreckage and black boxes are recovered.

By the time the calls were attempted, the plane had become invisible to civilian radar. It had flown west without communications past Sumatra and beyond the range of Malaysian military radar.

Mr Dolan said the new analysis suggested the jet was already flying south when the first phone call was attempted less than 20 minutes after the plane dropped off military radar.

Today, Mr Truss and Liow Tiong Lai, Malaysia's transport minister, signed a memorandum of understanding sharing the ongoing costs of the search for the missing Boeing 777 as it progresses to an expensive new stage.

Mr Liow said investigators had advised that success of the undersea search for wreckage and the aircraft's back boxes with cockpit voice recordings and flight data was crucial to solving the mystery of the disaster.

'The investigation cannot continue without the search result,' he said.

'We need to find the plane, we need to find the black box in the plane so that we can have a conclusion in the investigation.'

Malaysia, as the country where the Boeing was flagged, has overall responsibility for the investigation.

But Australia has search and rescue responsibility for the area of the Indian Ocean where the plane is thought to have crashed 1,100 miles off Australia's west coast.

From next month three vessels towing underwater vehicles equipped with side-scan sonar, multi-beam echo sounders and video equipment will begin scouring 23,000 square miles of search area.

The operation could take up to a year and cost AU$52million(£29m).

Before the underwater search starts, two survey ships are mapping the entire search area.

Chinese vice minister of transport He Jianzhong, who also attended the Canberra meeting, said the ministers agreed that the search would not be interrupted or given up. Most of the lost passengers, 153, were Chinese.
