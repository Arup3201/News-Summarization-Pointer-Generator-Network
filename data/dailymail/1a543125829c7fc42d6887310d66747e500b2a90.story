People living in one English city are so fed up with eastern European migrants flooding into the area they have renamed the place - 'Poland.'

The official sign welcoming visitors to Hereford has been defaced with the word ‘Poland’ covering the name of the town.

An estimated 2,500 Polish migrants live and work in Hereford with most working on the dozens of fruit-picking farms nearby.

A sign outside Hereford has been defaced by residents unhappy with the number of Polish migrants living in the town.

Many residents are concerned about the pressure the migrants and their children are putting on schools and other services, while others fear the town is losing its distinctive character.

Resident John Bull, 45, said: 'I think a lot of people are concerned that the town now feels more like Krakow than a traditional market town.

'There is a real frustration that the Poles are taking over the area.

'I applaud the people who changed the town’s sign because that’s how lots of people feel - it’s not Hereford anymore.'

The popularity of Britain as a 
destination for migration inside Europe has followed Labour's decision 
to open the country’s doors to workers from Poland and seven other 
eastern countries which joined the EU in 2004. Others in the bloc 
introduced special measures to curb such migrants.

Eurostat put the number of Poles in Britain at 541,000 last year, although some experts believe this to be a significant under estimate.

Shops catering for the Polish, and 
other Eastern European communities are now a common sight in British 
cities as well as in many market towns.

In
some rural areas, where thousands of Eastern European farm workers help
gather crops, warning signs in Polish and a range of other language are
numerous.

Some schools 
have been overwhelmed with the children of large numbers of Polish and 
other Eastern European migrants, many of whom do not speak English as a 
first language.

In Peterbrough the city council was 
forced to erect temporary classrooms to cope with the impact of the 
influx of around 20,000 new migrants in just six years.

One in four babies born in Britain now has a foreign-born mother.

in 2010 around 20,000 babies were born 
to Polish migrants – more than 50 a day.

In 2005 – the year after Britain opened its borders to workers 
from the former Eastern Bloc countries – the number was lower than 3,500.

The number of people living in England and 
Wales rose by a record 3.7million over the past decade.

The results of last year’s census indicate 
that the population is swelling at its fastest rate for 100 years, largely due 
to high immigration, and has now reached 56.1million.

With the exception of tiny Malta, England is 
now the most crowded country in Europe, with 407 people for every square 
kilometre. Ten years ago Holland held second place behind Malta.

Around 55 cent of the population increase was 
a result of immigration, the Office for National Statistics said. The overall 
effect is likely to be far higher, as immigration has also contributed to the 
rising birth rate. Census estimates on this area are expected later this 
year.

Yesterday’s figures prompted more calls for 
reductions, following a decade in which hundreds of thousands of Eastern 
Europeans were allowed to settle in the UK after the expansion of the EU. 
Immigration minister Damian Green said: ‘These figures are firm evidence that 
Labour let immigration run out of control.’
