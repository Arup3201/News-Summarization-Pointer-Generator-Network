A gunman has died after reportedly being shot several times by police  during a siege that lasted several hours.

Police say the 42-year-old man, who is not believed to be a resident, was alone and locked inside a parked car in the carport of a block of units in Inala in Brisbane's south west from around 12pm.

A police media spokesman confirmed the man had 'been hit with a projectile'.

A home in Inala in Brisbane's south west, was surrounded by armed officers where a man armed with a gun hid in a parked car

He was then dragged out of the vehicle by officers who handcuffed him at about 4pm before declaring he was in a critical condition. 

Aerial news footage has shown riot police gathering around a patient on a stretcher in the car park of the apartment complex, while a TV journalist on the scene reported hearing several gunshots.  

A black armoured vehicle had been parked directly in front of the car with the man inside, while armed SERT officers monitored the situation and tried to talk him down. 

Brisbane regional duty officer, Inspector Richard Kroon, conformed that police had been conducting an investigation at the units when they began speaking to the man.

He then allegedly presented a firearm causing police to immediately withdraw from the area and attempt negotiations with the man. 

'At about 3:45 further interactions had occurred and as a result of that a number of shots were fired and a 42-year-old man was subsequently pronounced deceased,' Insp. Kroon said.

'The matter is being investigated by the Police Ethical Standards Command and they will be preparing a report for the state coroner.'

Police surrounded him and were attempting a negotiation before the shoot-out

Earlier in the day, Insp. Kroon said: 'there's no real threat. I don't believe he is a resident, and no one has been evacuated.

'They are speaking to him by phone that was given to him by police and police will take as long as it takes to negotiate a peaceful outcome.'

'The best outcome is that the man comes out the vehicle, unarmed, and surrenders.' 

A police media spokesman also added: 'officers are behind him, he's not going anywhere.'

'The man was being investigated for something, he came to the attention of police who found him in a car with a gun, he pointed it at them so they’ve sent in the big guns, a negotiator and the heavy duty cops in black,' he said.

Shortly after midday, police made an emergency declaration under the Public Safety Preservation Act, asking people to avoid the area.

It was in effect for the area bounded by Comorant, Clipper, Brolga, Parakeet, Patridge, Wirraway, Kittyhawk and Inala Avenue.

'The roads are blocked off, it’s still a stand off, he’s not making any demands at the moment, police are asking people to stay away from the area,' said the police media spokesman said at the time.

'There's no chance of harm to the public.'
