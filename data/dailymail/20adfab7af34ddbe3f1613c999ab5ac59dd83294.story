When John Travolta planted an awkward kiss on an unwitting Scarlett Johansson at the Oscars on Sunday evening, the surrounding paparazzi swiftly captured the fist-gnawingly awful moment in its full glory. 

Scarlett's icy stare spoke volumes as John snaked an arm around her svelte waist and brushed his lips against her cheek, and promptly sent the Twittersphere into a frenzy of Travolta-related memes. 

But it seems the Hollywood actor isn't the only one guilty of mistiming a smooch. We've found a whole raft of  celebrities who lunged in for a kiss and ended up on a collision course with embarrassment. Here's our pick of the best...plus a guide to how you can get it right.

Successfully puckering up in public is always a minefield...it's difficult to create chemistry with a hundred flashbulbs pointing in your direction. 

Recent kissing fails include supermodel Naomi Campbell, who struggled to get to grips with Sarah Ferguson during the Fashion For Relief Show, at London Fashion Week. 

And pop mogul Simon Cowell seems to struggle with all of his paramours. Simon and girlfriend Lauren  were captured in an uncomfortable embrace at the Elle Style Awards in London this week while an appearance on the Jay Leno Show in 2010 with then fiancée Mezhgan Hussainy attracted plenty of ridicule.

So, what are the golden rules when it comes to clinches? How do you avoid clashing teeth, bruising chins or bruising noses? 

Etiquette consultant William Hanson says the trick is letting a woman guide the situation. He says: 'In social situations, a man should take the lead from the woman as to how they will greet. 

'Sadly women don't know now that they need to make the first move, as it were. If the woman extends her hand then that means the pair will shake hands. If she opens her arms wide, there will be a hug, and so on.'

It's hard enough for couples who are comfortable in each others' presence but greeting an acquaintance can also throw up squirming situations. William adds that: 'Two kisses is now the norm in the UK and Europe, although older British generations will just kiss once (cheek to cheek - never lips on cheek!).' 

He adds: 'While across the pond in America social kissing is not as popular although it is seen more in New York and LA. And if you get stuck - simple extend a hand and forget the kiss altogether.'
