A teaching intern allegedly stole a six-year-old's iPad and sold it online for Christmas shopping money.

University of North Georgia student Kelsey Rose Salie, 21, of Flowery Branch, Georgia, was working as an unpaid intern at Chestatee Elementary School in Gainesville, when she reportedly took the device.

According to a report by the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office, the $200 she received after selling the iPad through her boyfriend's Facebook account was returned.

She was arrested after the child's parents reported the theft to authorities and the child identified her in Facebook photos. 

The parents had been contacted by a woman from Hall County who had bought the device. 

The buyer noted their contact information when she switched the iPad on - but it had been her father who met Salie in person.

The report explained that it was Salie's boyfriend who returned the money after he discovered the the iPad had been stolen.

Salie was arrested for misdemeanor theft and released from Forsyth County Detention Center on December 4 after posting a $1,150 bond.

She allegedly told authorities that she took the iPad from the child's backpack last month after students went to another class.

She explained she needed money to buy Christmas presents for her family and she used her boyfriend's account because he had more friends than she did.  

Jennifer Caracciolo, a spokeswoman for Forsyth County Schools, told Forsyth News the situation was 'unfortunate' and the first problem they have had with interns from the college.

Kate Maine, director of university relations for the University of North Georgia, said the incident would be referred to a student conduct process, which will be carried our alongside a police investigation.

She explained possible punishments range from a verbal warning to expulsion. 

She added Salie, who is a junior, will not be suspended as UNG does not issue them unless there is a threat to safety - but classes and the internship have ended for the semester.

'This is what we believe to be a truly isolated incident,' Ms Maine said. 

'We have a very good relationship with our local school systems, and we hope to continue that relationship. We are disappointed in this particular situation.'
