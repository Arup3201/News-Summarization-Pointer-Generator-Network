A 62-year-old woman formerly suspected of killing an Aspen socialite over a rent dispute has spoken publicly for the first time about the murder case. 

Nancy Styler was arrested in February after the body of 57-year-old ski resort heiress Nancy Pfister was discovered, with evidence leading back to Mrs Styler and her husband. 

But Nancy was cleared of all charges in June, when husband William Styler III admitted to hitting Pfister in the head with a hammer in her sleep. He is currently serving a 20 year sentence for the crime. 

Innocence: Nancy Styler (left) was arrested in February under suspicion she murdered Aspen socialite Nancy Pfister (right). The charges were later dropped when her husband admitted to the killing 

Killer: Mrs Styler's husband William Styler III confessed to the murder in June and has since been sentenced to 20 years in prison 

In an interview with ABC News' 20/20, Mrs Styler said she had 'absolutely nothing to do' with her former landlady's death. 

Pfister, who was once engaged to actor Michael Douglas, had rented her home to Styler and his wife while she vacationed in Australia and was found dead in a closet shortly after she returned home to Aspen.

On a Facebook posting before her death, Pfister said that the Stylers were not paying rent. Defense attorneys denied that claim.

Pfister's parents co-founded the Buttermilk ski area. 

Her assistant Katherine Carpenter,  56, was also arrested under suspicion of murder but later had the charges dropped as well when wheelchair-bound Mr Styler confessed. 

Dispute: The Stylers were renting Pfister's house just before her killing. She called them in February to say she was returning from Australia and that they had four days to get out 

Helper: Pfister's assistant Katherine Carpenter (left) found her body stuffed in a closet and was once considered an accomplice as well. Those charges have been dropped as well 

The Stylers had been living in Pfister's $4,000-a-month Aspen house when they abruptly received a call from her saying she was returning from Australia and they had four days to get out. 

That allegedly enraged the couple, and they had verbal fights with their landlady before eventually finding a hotel to stay in the meantime. 

Discovering that her husband committed the brutal murder came as a complete shock to Mrs Styler.  

'The jail part was a day at the beach compared to learning that the person that you've been with for 32 years committed such an awful crime,' she said.

Taken aback: Mrs Styler says she was completely shocked to learn her husband committed the terrible crime 

Mr Styler allegedly went to Pfister's house while she was sleeping and hit her over the head with a hammer.

'He said, "I looked at her peacefully while our life was being torn apart," and he said, "I lost it,"' Nancy Styler said. 

Her body was discovered by Carpenter, three days later, stuffed in a closet.

Mr Styler took several objects from the scene including the murder weapon, and hid them in the back of their shared car. His wife says she drove around in that car for days without knowing it. 

Investigators are still suspicious of how Mr Styler, who has trouble walking, could have pulled off the murder. 

'We're thinking, you know, "How could he physically do that?"' Agent Lisa Miller told 20/20. 'We took a break, and I asked Mr. Styler if he wanted to stand up. And he informed me he couldn't stand up. He didn't have the strength to.'

If no evidence is uncovered, Carpenter can be charged again but Mrs Styler can not be thanks to a plea deal. 

Though she is no longer a suspect in the case, Mrs Styler says she is still judged for her husband's involvement.   

'Why can't people believe this? Why do they have to involve me in this?' Mrs Styler asked. 'I say, "Go back and look at things in your mind and think about how this could happen, and don’t judge people unless you know the story."'
