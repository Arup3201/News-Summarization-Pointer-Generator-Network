James Taylor and Ravi Bopara have been named in an England one-day squad laden with experience to take on Sri Lanka ahead of the World Cup.

Sportsmail exclusively revealed the 16-man squad England will take to the sub-continent which is heavily reliant on the tried and trusted with Alastair Cook in charge.

There is no place for Surrey’s big-hitting Jason Roy, who England believe is not yet ready for 50-over international cricket, but there are reprieves for Taylor and Bopara who both missed out on the 3-1 one-day series defeat by India.

James Taylor will be handed a late World Cup opportunity when named in the ODI squad to face Sri Lanka 

Probable  squad for Sri Lanka: Cook (capt), Ali, Anderson, Bell, Bopara, Buttler (wkt), Finn, Gurney, Hales, Jordan, Morgan, Root, Stokes, Taylor, Tredwell, Woakes.

The unlucky Taylor has been consistently overlooked but is finally rewarded for prolific runscoring for Nottinghamshire, particularly in limited-overs cricket, while Bopara is welcomed back after his controversial omission.

Ian Bell, despite only three hundreds in 148 one-day internationals, makes the cut for a seven-match series in Sri Lanka that will provide testing preparation for England in November and December ahead of February’s World Cup. 

The retention of Cook as captain was far less certain in one-day cricket than for the Test arena but the vote of confidence from the selectors now is confirmation of their desire for him to lead England in the World Cup.

Ravi Bopara (pictured playing for Essex in the County Championship on Wednesday) will also be included

Eoin Morgan's form in the 50-over game has been a source of concern for the England selectors

Cook has his detractors in limited-overs cricket but the fact remains that he has five one-day hundreds, is one of the top 10 runscorers in world 50-over cricket since the last World Cup and has a strike-rate as captain comparable to Michael Clarke’s. He has silenced doubters before and is determined to do so again, as he told Sportsmail in an exclusive interview where he said he would be 'devastated' to miss out now, before almost certainly handing over the one-day reins after the World Cup.

The difficulties encountered by Alex Hales on his step up to 50-over international cricket against India, where he was quickly worked out by Indian seamers using two new white balls, convinced the selectors that there is still more chance of Test-class batsmen in Cook and Bell scoring centuries than an exciting Twenty20 rookie like Roy.

There have been more concerns among the selectors about Eoin Morgan’s form than Cook’s but he made a welcome return to something close to his best in the Twenty20 international that finished the international season.

Morgan remains a key figure if England are going to upset the odds and compete for their long overdue first World Cup title, something they have not come even close to since losing the 1992 final to Pakistan in Melbourne.

England have under-achieved in limited-overs cricket for much of the 22 years since but they did briefly reach the top of the world one-day standings two years ago and reached the final of last year’s Champions Trophy under Cook’s captaincy and using the traditional one-day methods they continue to advocate now.

That means they will look to the likes of Cook, Bell and Joe Root to provide the anchor role and try to bat throughout the innings, leaving wickets in hand for Morgan, Bopara and Jos Buttler to explode in the final overs.

There have been selectorial concerns over the one-dimensional nature of Harry Gurney but he survives now in a largely unchanged bowling attack because of coach Peter Moores preference for a left-armer and with there being few viable alternatives. 

The England Performance Squad, which will be based in Sri Lanka at the same time as the one-day series, will provide Roy with one last chance to stake his claim but time is running out for him and other aspirants to gatecrash England’s World Cup party.
