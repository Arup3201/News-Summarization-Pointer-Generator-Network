A 15-year-old youth is facing a life sentence after being found guilty of stabbing a student to death in a row over conkers.

The youth was found guilty at the Old Bailey of murdering architecture student Steven Grisales, 21.

Mr Grisales died after he went over to remonstrate with three boys throwing conkers still in their spiky husks on August 31 last year.

He was walking to Silver Street station, Edmonton, north London, when he was attacked in College Close.

The youth, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was remanded in custody to be sentenced next month.

After the verdict, Detective Inspector Richard Beadle said: 'Steven did no more than stand up to unruly youths and for that he has lost his life.

'But for the courageous intervention of a local resident, I am convinced the attack would have continued.

'He placed himself in front of Steven whilst the youth continued to try to stab him.

'The defendant’s arrogance and contempt for others belies his age.'

Steven’s mother Jasmid said in a statement: 'Steven was always loved by every person who had the privilege of knowing him.'

Andrew Edis, QC, prosecuting, told the trial: 'This was a sudden, unnecessary killing as a response to a confrontation which took place in the street, which was about nothing very much.

'It was about throwing some conkers. Horse chestnut trees in north London shedding their conkers, people picking them up and throwing them about.'

The Old Bailey had heard the boys had been throwing conkers at two female friends before Steven was nearly struck by a flying chestnut hurled by one of the men, triggering the row.

Murder scene: College Close, Edmonton where Mr Grisales was stabbed. The accused blamed another youth but was identified from his clothing on CCTV

The promising student was walking along College Close when the argument escalated and he was attacked by the 15-year-old.

The accused blamed another youth for the stabbing, but was identified from his distinctive clothing on CCTV.

He claimed Mr Grisales had over-reacted and tried to hit him with a skateboard.

Neighbour Mandy Addy said she was looking out of her window and saw one of the youths lunge at Mr Grisales.

She said she had earlier seen three people sitting on a wall in front of her house and then heard the sound of shouting.

'It was a very excited, that kind of voice,' she told the Old Bailey.

'I looked out the window. The person who got stabbed was facing towards me. He was gesturing with his hands.

'He had his arms up and was trying to placate him.'

She then saw the youth who was confronting Mr Grisales swing his arm at the victim.

'He seemed to make contact with the victim’s left side. The two other people who were with him seemed to be shouting,' Ms Addy said.

The victim went down on one knee, but managed to lift himself up to his feet.

'There was a second blow. It landed in the same place. The victim was shouting. He went down a second time.

'He got up. He tried to make it down the road to the train station. He quickly changed his mind and ran across the road and into the garden of another house.'

Ms Addy said two other neighbours ran to try and help Mr Grisales and she called the police.

Mr Grisales collapsed in the garden and was taken to hospital for emergency surgery but died the following day.

Jurors heard the 15-year-old boy was later picked out from CCTV images of the three men by one of the neighbours, who also recognised the youth's street name.

The teenager handed himself in at Edmonton Police station on September 5, 2011, and gave a prepared statement blaming one of his friends.

He claimed that he and one of his friends started 'throwing spiky objects' at two girls they knew.

'We did this recklessly and one of the spiky objects went close to a man who was walking in the street,' the statement read.

'This man started shouting and swearing at me. It was aggressive and abusive. He was very angry.

'I was close to him and the man crossed the road and picked up a skateboard. He hit me on the head twice.

'I punched him in the face. I did so in self-defence while I was being attacked.'

The teenager said he heard one of the girls telling one of his friends to 'take the knife.'

His statement continued. 'I saw my friend appear to punch [Steven Grisales] in the chest. I saw blood on his t-shirt. I ran away down the close.'

Jurors heard that the teenager wrote his street name on his mattress in his cell along with the words 'NPK. Riding the Big Bird. Innocent on Remand.'

Police also found a knife scabbard under his bed at his home in Enfield, it is claimed.
