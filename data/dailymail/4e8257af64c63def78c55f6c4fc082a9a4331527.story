A supply teacher has resigned from a primary school after she allegedly put sticky tape over the mouth of a nine year-old child to 'keep her quiet'. 

The teacher, who has not been named, taught at Fowlmere Primary in the pretty village of Fowlmere, Cambridgeshire.

The incident, which took place earlier this month, was apparently meant as a joke but concerned parents at the school have slammed it as 'worrying' and 'completely unacceptable'.

The school, which is rated 'good' by school's inspectorate Ofsted, has apologised to the girl's parents and said the matter was investigated and the teacher has now resigned.

A Cambridgeshire County Council spokesman said: 'A full investigation has taken place and the supply teacher spoken to.

'Although there was no ill intent or unkindness intended, it is clear this incident should not have happened and the member of staff has resigned from their post.

'We have spoken to the child's parents and apologised as this fell below the standards we expect.'

But the incident has left parents concerned.

One parent, who did not want to be named, said: 'It doesn't matter whether it was a joke or not. However tempting it is to do something like this it is completely unacceptable and very worrying.'

Deborah Roberts, a former Fowlmere school governor and a district and parish councillor for the village, said she was satisfied with the response from the school.

She said: 'I have every confidence that the people in charge at Fowlmere Primary, the headteacher and the governors, have done whatever was needed to be done and have handled this properly.

'The teacher has resigned and I would think there is really no further need for any parent to be concerned.'

However, Chris McGovern, a former headmaster and chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said the supply teacher should be retrained.

He said: 'You simply cannot do this with children, the incident would have been very damaging to the child.

'If you feel the need to tape a child's mouth up you should not be in the profession at all.

A Cambridgeshire County Council (pictured) spokesman said: 'Although there was no ill intent or unkindness intended, it is clear this incident should not have happened'

'The only explanation is that the teacher must have lost control, they must have not been able to cope with the child.

'Saying it was a joke is a feeble excuse. You cannot inflict that sort of harm as a joke, it isn't a joke for the child.

'If you are resorting to those tactics you may as well pack it in and go home, and that seems to be what this teacher has done.

'This is completely inappropriate, it can't be allowed to happen. The teacher needs to be retrained.'

Claude Knights, director of children's charity Kidscape,  said the act was a form of child abuse.

She said: 'An affective and properly trained teacher would not use that action. Children should know there is a time for quiet and a time for speaking and there are ways and means to do that.

'But putting sticky tape on a child's mouth can never be seen as acceptable. It's child abuse really. The parents of that child should rightfully be up in arms. It makes them a laughing stock to their peers.

'It's a way of ridiculing the child, it's a hard-hitting form of bulling. It says to the rest of the class that it is acceptable for them to do that so it has a ricochet effect on how that child is treated by their peers.

'The imbalance of power makes it a very sinister development, it's a breach of trust that is severe for the child. Saying it's a joke is an immature excuse.'

This is not the first incident of its kind. In March this year, an art teacher at a Somerset school was suspended following claims she lined up pupils, put sticky tape over their mouths and demanded they keep it on for the duration of the lesson.
