A nurse who was taunted for being fat when she reached nearly 15st aged 15 has beaten the bullies to become a beauty queen.

Emma Day, now 19, competed in her first national pageant on Sunday after slimming down to  8st 9lb.

Her night on the runway marked an incredible transformation from the former size 22 schoolgirl who was teased and even attacked by fellow pupils over her weight.

The trainee nurse, from Dewsbury, West Yorks, said she was often beaten up and even had objects thrown at her by cruel school bullies.

She was so embarrassed by her size she refused to go the gym and started working out in her bedroom.

When friends began noticing Emma's slimmer figure last year she decided to compete in a local beauty pageant.

She went on to become Miss Teen Leeds and competed at Miss Teen Great Britain in Blackpool on Sunday.

Emma, who now weighs 8st 9lb, said: 'When I was younger I'd go to see my grandparents and have tea with them before going back home and scoffing another portion of food.

'I really loved biscuits too and I nearly always had a packet in my hand. My school years were absolutely horrific at times.

'I weighed almost 15st at my heaviest and other kids would throw stuff at me, hit me and call me all sorts of names because of my size.

Originally too embarrassed to go to a gym Emma began exercising in her bedroom and the weight began to fall off (left, overweight aged 14, right, pictured now) 

'I got to a point where I thought enough was enough so I bought a stack of workout DVDs and started training in my bedroom.

'After a few months people started to notice I had lost weight and it gave me a real confidence boost.

'I kept on going with the sit-ups, press-ups, running and everything else and I seriously got hooked on training.

'I'm so glad I did it and I've never looked back since.'

When friends began to notice the change in her appearance they suggested Emma entered a pageant 

The inspirational beauty queen, who is now a size eight, cleaned up her diet of junk food and started training for more than an hour every day in a bid to shed the pounds.

Her gruelling training regime soon paid dividends and before long she found herself competing at Miss Teen UK.

Since making her beauty pageant debut, Emma has gone on to claim second prize at the Face of the Globe beauty contest and cruised to victory in the Miss True Beauty event.

She said: 'The first time I went up on stage at the Miss Teen UK contest was incredible.

Emma was crowned Miss Teen Leeds and competed at Miss Teen Great Britain on Sunday

'I was so nervous as I'd never done anything like that before but it gave me so much confidence that I was desperate to do it all over again.

'Being crowned Miss Teen Leeds this years was an amazing feeling and I'm hoping I can have some success at the national competition in Blackpool.

'It's just incredible to look at pictures of myself when I was 15 and then look in the mirror at how I am now.

'It took around two-and-a-half-years of really hard graft to get to where I am but it was well worth it.

'I feel like a completely new person.'
