Ned Kelly, aged 16, at the Old Melbourne Gaol. A poignant 133-year-old letter has revealed details of his last stand

A poignant 133-year-old letter has revealed details of the last stand of Australia's most famous outlaw, Ned Kelly, describing the moment bullets 'slid off him like hail' as he faced a bloody battle with police.

In the first 'everyman' account of the Glenrowan Siege, a young bank teller named Donald Sutherland tells how he witnessed Kelly being captured and, in the letter to his parents in Scotland, details the shootout with police on June 28, 1880.

The heavy homemade armour and helmet which protected Kelly during the battle helped make him an iconic figure in Australian history.

But in scenes similar to Clint Eastwood's western, a Fistful of Dollars, the bullets seemed to have bounced off him.

In the film Eastwood's character Joe enters a showdown with a steel chest-plate hidden beneath his poncho, as his opponent's rifle shots bounce off, allowing him to win the duel.

'Ned's armour alone weighed 97 pounds,' Mr Sutherland writes.

'The police thought he was a fiend, seeing their rifle bullets were sliding off him like hail," Sutherland wrote.

'The force of the rifle bullets made him stagger when hit but it was only when they got him on the legs and arms that he reluctantly fell, exclaiming as he did so "I am done. I am done".'

In the letter, Mr Sutherland tells how he had dashed by horseback 
from the nearby town of Oxley after learning the notorious Kelly 
gang was at an inn in Glenrowan.

By the time he had arrived, Ned was
lying badly wounded on a stretcher after losing the battle with police, 
despite the homemade suit of armour he had been wearing.

He said: 'I was 
really sorry for him to see him lying pierced by bullets and still 
showing no signs of pain,' Mr Sutherland wrote in his 
beautifully-scripted letter.

'His three sisters were there also, Mrs Skillion, Kate Kelly and a younger one. 

'Kate was sitting at his head with her arms round his neck while the others were crying in a mournful strain.'

Mr Sutherland writes to his parents of a 'powerful' man with 'soft eyes'.

He said: 'Ned does not at all look like a murderer and bushranger - he is a very 
powerful man, aged about 27, black hair and beard with a soft mild 
looking face and eyes - his mouth being the only wicked portion of the 
face.'

Alex McDermott, a research scholar at the State Library of Victoria, said the Glenrowan Siege had been heavily scrutinised in the past century.

He said but the letter was the first time the events had been represented in an unbiased and 'everyman' perspective.

'To date, every single account has always been from a member of the police or a Kelly family member or adviser,' he said. 'Sutherland doesn't condemn either side, he just gives it out.'

The Kelly Gang was outlawed after they killed three policemen and robbed several banks.

They became a symbol of social tensions between poor Irish settlers and the wealthy establishment, with Kelly becoming a folk hero to many for standing up to the Anglo-Australian ruling class.

'He was lying on a stretcher quite calm and collected, not withstanding the great pain he must have been suffering from his wounds,' Sutherland wrote, and added that Kelly was surrounded by his crying sisters.

The letter passed to Sutherland's descendants in Scotland, England and Canada before the family decided to donate it to the State Library of Victoria in Melbourne.

It will be on view from Monday.

Ned Kelly and his gang rode 
through the hills north of Melbourne, plundering and robbing before the 
shootout with police at Stringybark Creek.

A desperate 
confrontation with police occurred at Glenrowan on June 28, 1880,

Kelly, in his home-fashioned head and body armour, faced police before he was showered with rifle bullets.

He was convicted of three 
counts of wilful murder and hanged at the Old Melbourne Gaol in November
1880.

His last words before he was hanged were reported to have been: 'Such is life.'

Edward 'Ned' Kelly was the first son of Irish convict John 'Red' Kelly, who moved to Australia in 1848.

Ned was born in Beveridge, just north of Melbourne, some time between June 1854 and June 1855.

At the age of 14, Ned was arrested for the first time for assaulting a Chinese pig farmer.

The
year after, he was arrested again, this time for being a suspected 
accomplice of robber Harry Power. Both these charges were dismissed, but
it was too late: Ned had come to the attention of the police.

Some years later a police officer went to the Kelly home, hoping to arrest Ned's brother Dan for stealing horses.

The officer claimed that when he turned up he was shot in the wrist by 
Ned, although it was unclear whether Ned was even present at the time.

Ned's mother Ellen was arrested for aiding and abetting an attempted 
murder and sentenced to three years.

Ned
and other members of his family went into hiding and hoped by starting 
up a whiskey distillery they could earn enough money to appeal their 
mother's sentence.

But the 
police were hot on their heels. Four officers were dispatched to track 
them down and Ned ended up killing three of them, officially becoming an
outlaw.

He went on to 
rob two banks before police finally caught up with him. Ned was hanged 
on November 11, 1880. His last words were ‘Such is life’.

Despite
being a violent career criminal, many consider him to symbolise the 
Australian spirit - an endearing underdog not afraid to challenge 
authority.

He
once wrote an 8,000 word letter, later used against him at trial, in 
which he explained he was forced into a life of crime by situations 
beyond his control.
