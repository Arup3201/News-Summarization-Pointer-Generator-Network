Bootcamp: One Direction heart- throb Harry Styles is taking action to develop a six-pack

One Direction heart- throb Harry Styles may be adored by millions of teenage girls around the world but it seems that he’s not entirely happy with his physique.

The 20-year-old chart-topper, pictured above, is now taking action to develop a six-pack by joining classes at London’s famous Barry’s Bootcamp gym.

The studio is located close to Harry’s home in North London, which means he can roll out of bed for the hour-long high-intensity workout.

‘Harry really gets stuck into it,’ reveals a fellow bootcamper. 

‘The workouts involve 30 minutes on the treadmill and 30 minutes on the floor and Harry really pushes himself. He leaves with his long hair soaked in sweat.’ 

Don't share a lipstick

Sharing lipsticks may increase the risk of human papillomavirus (HPV). There are more than 100 types of HPV that affect the skin and moist membranes of the body, including the mouth and throat, and it is a highly contagious infection.

Transmission occurs most frequently during sex, but a new study says HPV is also associated with the sharing of cigarettes, lipsticks, or toothbrushes.

There's a new way for athletes and gym fans to get muscle-building protein after a workout. 

Coco Pro is a coconut water drink fortified with whey, which means that each serving has 20g of protein – the equivalent of one-and-a-half chicken breasts. It’s available to buy online at musclefood.com for £3 per carton. 

Lansinoh, the makers of a nipple cream for breastfeeding mothers, has launched a new online parenting club. 

The Happy Tummy Club will provide expert advice and tips for expectant mothers through to the families of children of pre-school age in a monthly email (picture posed by model)
