A fire-breathing stilt-walker whose head caught fire during an opera rehearsal left hospital today with his first and second-degree burns wrapped in bandages.

Wesley Daniel, 24, was working on a production at the Lyric Opera of Chicago when the horrific accident happened on Tuesday.

The photograph, released by Loyola University Medical, shows Mr Daniel flashing the OK sign toÂ  camera. His mouth, neck and left hand are swathed in bandages and his lips appear painfully swollen.

Mr Daniel was taken to hospital shortly after 5pm on Tuesday suffering from second-degree burns to his face and throat and first-degree burns to his hands. He also suffered respiratory problems.

The flames took hold when he blew the fire - despite wearing a fire-proof safety mask. As he was engulfed in flames, Mr Daniel staggered away and collapsed off stage.

A stage manager with a fire extinguisher then put out spots of flame onstage.

Skilled: Mr Wesley is a trained fire-breathing stilt-walker

The incident happened in front of a 
packed auditorium and many of the audience thought the stunt was part of
the performance.

The opera Die Meistersinger von Nurenberg, by Richard Wagner, is due to open tomorrow - without pyrotechnics.

The stunt had been approved by the Chicago Fire Department.

Chicago paramedics took Daniel to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, but he was later transferred to Loyola University Medical Center in a critical condition.

His father Clifton Daniel told NBC that his son's lungs were not affected.

Mr Daniel is a great-grandson of president Harry Truman.

The 24-year-old actor attended Roosevelt University and was described as a professional who was experienced in stunts.

The Lyric Opera of Chicago issued the following statement Monday evening: 'An actor sustained burns this afternoon at Lyric Opera of Chicago during a dress rehearsal.

'The actor, Wesley Daniel, was performing a fire-spitting effect while on stilts. He was wearing a flameproof costume and mask.

'Lyric's emergency plan was activated immediately. Trained fire guards extinguished minor flames immediately. The fire curtain was lowered. Lyric personnel called 911 and paramedics arrived within minutes. Chicago Fire Department commenced an immediate investigation, then allowed the rehearsal to continue. The actor is being treated at Loyola Hospital.

'The decision was made to remove the fire-spitting effect from performances.'

Horrific: When he blew the fire, despite wearing a fire-proof fire mask, the flames still took hold

Accident: The rehearsal was five hours in when the accident happened on stage

Horror: The incident happened in front of a packed auditorium and many of the audience thought the stunt was part of the show, which opens on Friday at the Lyric Opera
