While his Manchester United colleagues battled away at Huish Park in the FA Cup, senior midfielder Michael Carrick bumped into Stone Roses lead singer Ian Brown on his day off.

Louis van Gaal fielded a strong squad, including Wayne Rooney and Radamel Falcao, for the trip to Yeovil, but gifted Carrick a rest ahead of next Sunday's game against Southampton.

On his rest day, Carrick went out for a walk and bumped into Brown on his travels. The Stone Roses frontman posed for a picture with Carrick, which the United man later posted to social media site WhoSay.

Alongside the photo, the 33-year-old posted the caption, 'Nice surprise bumping into Ian Brown on a morning stroll. #StoneRoses'. 

At Huish Park, Ander Herrera and Angel di Maria scored in the second half to take United through to the fourth round with a 2-0 win over Yeovil.

The home side were resilient, but could not hold on as United ran out deserved winners in Van Gaal's first taste of FA Cup football.
