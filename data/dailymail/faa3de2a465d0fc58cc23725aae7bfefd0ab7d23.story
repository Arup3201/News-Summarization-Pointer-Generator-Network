Banned: Hildur Lilliendahl Viggósdóttir was forbidden from using the social networking site for 30 days

A woman who took a picture of a threat made against her and posted it on her Facebook page has been banned from the social networking site.

Icelandic women’s rights campaigner Hildur Lilliendahl Viggósdóttir received a 30-day ban after she copied the threatening message made to her through another Facebook user’s status – which was set to be visible to the public – and posted it on her own wall.

Ms Viggósdóttir has a Facebook album called ‘Men Who Hate Women’, in which she posts screenshots of sexist comments made by men.

Another Facebook user Stefán Heiðar Erlingsson responded aggressively to the album, posting a threat on his Facebook status. ‘If I 'accidentally' ran over Hildur, she is probably the only person on earth that I would back up over, and leave the car on top of her with the hand brake on!!!;),’ he said, according to the Reykajavik Grapevine magazine. ‘Put this in your 'men who hate Hildur' folder, Hildur Lilliendahl,’ he added.

But when Ms Viggósdóttir did post the message she was banned from Facebook, as she had not asked permission to reproduce it.

Facebook’s terms state that users cannot take screenshots of and repost other users' Facebook statuses, without the written permission of the author.

The action has led to outcry in the Iceland, with many aghast the rule, which allows a Facebook user to post a death threat, but denies the recipient the right to repost it.

A petition against the rule has already garnered close to 1,500 signatures.

Facebook defended its action saying the rule was to prevent bullies using screen grabs to bypass privacy and sharing settings.

'At Facebook we deplore bullying. However, we have ways of dealing with it that start with victims reporting the abusive content to us via our on-site links,' a spokesperson said.

‘While the re-posting may have been well intentioned in this case, we need to apply our rules consistently to offer the best possible protection to the more than one billion people that use Facebook.'
