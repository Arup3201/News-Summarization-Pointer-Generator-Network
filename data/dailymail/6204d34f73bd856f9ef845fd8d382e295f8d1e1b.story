Didier Drogba stirred Chelsea emotions and rekindled misty-eyed memories of Munich as he scored a Champions League penalty to celebrate his first goal since returning to Stamford Bridge.

His first since the winning spot-kick against Bayern Munich in the Allianz Arena in May 2012 was the second in this six-goal Euro-romp against Maribor.

Jose Mourinho’s team are in control at the top of Group G, smoothly on course for a place in the last 16 of the Champions League.

They are unbeaten in 12 games this season, have scored 33 goals and Eden Hazard is in electrifying form.

Yet, as supporters wallowed in the nostalgia and goose-pimpled with excitement at the prospect of the season ahead, they and Mourinho must have been wondering quietly about the collateral damage.

Drogba was only on the pitch because Loic Remy had hurt his groin scoring the first of the night and Remy was only starting because Diego Costa was absent with his hamstring problems.

These inconveniences did nothing to stop them outclassing the champions of Slovenia.

John Terry scored a remarkable third, there was an own-goal, Maribor missed a penalty and Eden Hazard grabbed two late on, his first from another spot-kick.

There was no shortage of incident and with the points safe, thoughts turned to Manchester United on Sunday, and Mourinho’s mounting problems. He also has Cesar Azpilicueta suspended, after his red card at Crystal Palace.

Cesc Fabregas came off with 30 minutes remaining to preserve his energy and Chelsea ended with three teenagers on the pitch, including striker Dominic Solanke, making his debut. Mourinho had also rested Thibaut Courtois and Gary Cahill.

Ahead of the game, Mourinho had been at pains to avoid complacency and Maribor, who took points from Schalke and Sporting Lisbon, produced an early warning when Damjan Bohar found space between Terry and Kurt Zouma and headed over.

From here, Chelsea took a grip and had killed the game by half-time. First came Remy’s goal, followed by his injury. Terry split the Maribor defence and Remy fired low into the corner. As he moved away to celebrate the goal, he winced and pulled up.

He must have warned Mourinho about the problem because Drogba was already warming up. After hobbling on for two minutes, Remy came off and went straight down the tunnel. He must have been devastated.

After moving from Queen’s Park Rangers and waiting patiently for his chance, here it came and went and on came Drogba, to seize the script with a goal and a performance which was a considerable improvement on his only start of the season, against Schalke.

Willian won the spot-kick when he jinked into the box and jabbed a pass which clearly struck Ales Mertelj on the hand. Mertelj seemed justified to complain that the ball had been struck from only a yard away and he had no chance to adjust, but the argument was lost.

Dutch referee Danny Makkelie pointed to the spot, and Hazard gave Drogba the honour. “I was surprised and I wasn’t particularly pleased,” said Mourinho. “I have my choices and Hazard is number one.”

Drogba made it easier for the manager to accept by stepping up and with a sense of history scored his 158th Chelsea goal, sweeping the ball into the same corner as the penalty he scored to win the Champions League shoot-out, with his last kick before leaving for China.

It was far from an electric atmosphere at the Bridge for what always seemed likely to be a routine group game but this was a popular moment, greeted with an enormous cheer. Drogba is the club’s top European goalscorer and this was his 35th.

Terry’s first of the season was nearly as popular. Chelsea had been defending a corner when a Drogba clearance sparked a counter-attack and the captain put his head down and ran.

Hazard carried the ball to the edge of the Maribor penalty area, rolled in Fabregas on the overlap and his low cross was met at the back-post by Terry, who had made a 100-yard dash to convert, sliding in on the seat of his pants. He was a fraction offside, but there was no flag.

The second half belonged to Hazard, although the Belgian winger began it with a couple of fluffed chances. He linked up neatly with Drogba only to stumble over the ball as he manoeuvred it out of his feet to shoot, with only the goalkeeper to beat.

He squandered another chance at the back-post as he reached a low cross zipped in from the left by Filipe Luis but, as he turned the ball back across goal, it was deflected into the net by Maribor left-back Mitja Viler.

The Slovenians had the chance to pull one back from the spot when Nemanja Matic bundled into Agim Ibrami and sent him sprawling in the penalty area.

Ibrami picked himself to take the kick himself and it seemed for a split-second as if Cech was about to continue the Munich theme. The Czech ‘keeper, demoted this season to No.2 behind Courtois, had saved three in that Champions League final, but this one flashed past his dive, smacked into the post and flew out.

Willian rattled the woodwork before Hazard finally found the target, which the goals his dazzling skills deserved. This time he took responsibility from the spot, stepping up to score after Branislav Ivanovic had tumbled theatrically,

Hazard added his second and his team’s sixth as the clock ticked past 90 minutes. A win in Maribor in a fortnight and Chelsea will be within touching distance of the knock-out rounds with two games to spare.

First, that trip to Manchester United, where Mourinho’s mentor Louis van Gaal will attempt to throw a spanner in the works of this blue machine.
