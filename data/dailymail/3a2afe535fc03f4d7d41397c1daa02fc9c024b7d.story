England boss Roy Hodgson has written to every Premier League manager asking them not to play his World Cup players in club friendlies at the end of the season.

Hodgson is worried that players will have to play extra games instead of resting after a long Premier League season that ends on May 11.

Liverpool, who are likely to have five players in Hodgson’s squad for Brazil, including captain Steven Gerrard, have set up a friendly against Shamrock Rovers in Dublin on May 14. Two days earlier, Tottenham’s first team, which includes three England hopefuls, face an all-star XI for Ledley King’s testimonial.

Ensuring his players get rest is a crucial part of Hodgson’s World Cup planning, particularly with Theo Walcott and Jay Rodriguez already ruled out through injury and Daniel Sturridge, Jack Wilshere and Kyle Walker all experiencing problems recently.

To avoid a similar problem, Hodgson decided to write a heartfelt letter on Thursday to all 20 top-flight managers and Premier League club secretaries, with chief executives copied in.

In the letter, he outlined England’s itinerary leading up to their first World Cup game against Italy on June 14 and asked for his international players to be left out of fixtures between the end of the regular season and May 19 when the England meet up for their pre-World Cup training camp in Portugal.

Chelsea players will be exempt from the camp if they reach the Champions League final in Lisbon on May 24, while Arsenal players will be involved in the FA Cup final on May 17.
