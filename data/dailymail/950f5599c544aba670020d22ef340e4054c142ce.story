Taxpayers face a £1 billion bill to shore up the Houses of Parliament against chronic subsidence, which is already causing Big Ben to lean alarmingly.

The problem is so severe that MPs are even being asked to consider the radical proposal of selling off the historic building and moving into newly built offices – a move that could net £500 million for the Exchequer.

Although politicians are unlikely to agree to abandon a site that has been the seat of power for about 1,000 years, the fact that Commons Speaker John Bercow has floated the idea indicates the scale of the problem.

Work needed: Taxpayers face a £1billion bill to shore up the Houses of Parliament against chronic subsidence

MPs will hold a crisis meeting tomorrow to consider the options.

The all-party House of Commons Commission, chaired by Mr Bercow, will be shown surveyors’ reports detailing the risk of sinking into the Thames mud, electrical problems, fire risks and multiple safety hazards.

Even the boilers, dating from before the Second World War, are said to be ‘ready to blow’.

Repairs to the building, which would have to start by the end of the decade, would take at least five years to complete, with large sections sealed off on a rolling basis and MPs and their staff moving into temporary offices.

Even the Commons Chamber would have to be abandoned for at least two years.

One insider said the mock-Gothic building was ‘an elegant disaster’ that is ‘sinking into the mud’. He said: ‘The accountants argue it is not logical to spend £1 billion to repair an estate that is worth £1 billion.

‘So the stark choice is to spend the money and look extravagant, or to abandon one of the most iconic buildings in the world and sell it to the Russians or Chinese.’

The worst problems are linked to subsidence caused by decades of Tube trains rattling past the foundations and work on the underground Commons car park.

These have caused Big Ben’s bell tower to tilt 18 in from the vertical – enough for tourists to start noticing. Cracks have also started to appear in the walls of the Palace. 

Moving MPs would cause headaches. Options include using the Lords Chamber, as happened during the Second World War when a bomb destroyed the Commons chamber, or relocating to a secret emergency base that is ready for use in the event of a terrorist attack.

Treasury rules on the use of public money oblige MPs to consider even the most ‘radical options’, and selling Parliament would make sense in simple financial terms.

The site could be sold to a developer as a heritage site for £1 billion, while a replacement could be built elsewhere for £500 million – roughly the final cost of the over-budget Scottish Parliament in Holyrood, Edinburgh, at 2012 prices.

Mr Bercow’s advisers point to the Treasury’s Green Book on the use  of public money, which says that all ‘radical options’ on property development should be considered including ‘changing locations or sites’.  

The guidelines add: ‘These options 
may not become part of the formal appraisal, but can be helpful to test 
the parameters of feasible solutions.

Well-run brainstorming sessions can help generate such a range of ideas.’

The first palace to be built in Westminster was used as the primary London residence for the Monarch.

The Commons first assembled  there in 1213 when non-baronial representatives of the people were summoned to give their consent to tax laws. The present building was erected between 1840 and 1870.

Last night, a Commons spokesman confirmed that the sale of Parliament was included among the  proposals, but pointed out that as the building was listed, it was a ‘complicated’ option.

‘Any large future project would follow normal public-sector guidance on costing and the evaluation of all feasible options,’ he said.

‘The Commission will be considering whether to ask officials from both Houses to undertake a study into the long-term approach to the maintenance of Parliament.

‘No decisions are likely to be made for several years as to whether either House will need to move out of the Palace for a period to allow essential work to take place.’
