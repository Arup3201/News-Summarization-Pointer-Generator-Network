Forgotten man: The work of Alfred Russel Wallace, pictured, dubbed the 'forgotten father' of evolution, is set to be celebrated by the Natural History Museum in London

While his colleague Charles Darwin is revered as one of the greatest British scientists ever to have lived, Alfred Russel Wallace never became a household name.

Many believe the 19th century scientist, who may have even coined the phrase 'origin of species' which became the title of Darwin's earth-shattering theory, could be regarded as the 'forgotten father' of evolution.

He also came up with the concept of warning colouration in animals, and the Wallace effect, a hypothesis on how species evolved.

Wallace also did extensive fieldwork, first 
in the Amazon River basin and then in the Malay Archipelago, where he 
identified the Wallace Line that divides the Indonesian archipelago into
two distinct parts.

The work of Wallace is now finally set to be celebrated, 100 years after his death, in a series of events at the Natural History Museum in London.

A portrait of the scientist is to be unveiled in the museum's Central Hall close to the famous statue of Darwin by comedian and naturalist Bill Bailey tomorrow, and the museum will put an archive of Wallace's correspondence online, as well as displaying some of his most important specimens.

The Natural History Museum's Wallace 100 programme was organised to mark the centenary of his death in 1913 and put the biologist back in the spotlight.

Both Wallace and Darwin shared authorship of the scientific article that first proposed the theory of natural selection in 1858, a year before Darwin's book On the Origin of Species came out and secured a place in history.

Wallace independently came up with the idea of natural selection and founded the science of evolutionary biogeography - the study of the geographical distribution of plants and animals.

He made a significant impact in fields as diverse as anthropology and epidemiology, and gathered thousands of previously unknown species in South America and Asia.

Natural History Museum curator and Wallace expert Dr George Beccaloni said: 'This anniversary is a great opportunity to raise awareness of Wallace's ground-breaking scientific work, his valuable collections which are still being studied today, and his amazing adventures in South America and South East Asia in search of the process responsible for generating the astonishing diversity of life on Earth.

'Wallace's remarkable accomplishments are not as appreciated today as they were in his own lifetime, and are often overshadowed by Darwin's.'

Wallace will also be the subject of a BBC2 series to be screened in the spring and hosted by Bill Bailey, who is patron of the Wallace Fund which is raising money to pay for a life-size sculpture of the scientist.

Born in 1823, Alfred Russel Wallace was one of the 19th century's most remarkable intellectuals.

Not only did he co-discover the process of evolution by natural selection with Charles Darwin in 1858, but he also made very many other significant contributions, not just to biology, but also to subjects as diverse as glaciology, land reform, anthropology, ethnography, epidemiology, and astrobiology.

His pioneering work on evolutionary biogeography (the study of how plants and animals are distributed) led to him becoming recognised as that subject’s ‘father’.

Beyond this, Wallace is regarded as the pre-eminent collector and field biologist of tropical regions of the 19th century, and his book The Malay Archipelago (which was Joseph Conrad’s favourite bedside reading) is one of the most celebrated travel writings of that century and has never been out of print.

In February 1858 Wallace was suffering from an attack of fever in the village of Dodinga on the remote Indonesian island of Halmahera when suddenly the idea of natural selection as the mechanism of evolutionary change occurred to him.

As soon as he had sufficient strength he wrote an detailed essay explaining his theory and sent it together with a covering letter to Charles Darwin, who he knew from correspondence was interested in the subject of evolution.

He asked Darwin to pass the essay on to lawyer and foremost geologist of his day Charles Lyell if Darwin thought it was sufficiently interesting - probably hoping that Lyell would help to ensure that it was published in a good journal.

Lyell (who Wallace had never corresponded with) was one of the most respected scientists of the time and Wallace must have thought that he would be interested in reading his new theory because it explained the 'laws' which Wallace had proposed in his 'Sarawak Law' paper.

Darwin had mentioned in a letter to Wallace that Lyell had found Wallace's 1855 paper noteworthy.

Unbeknown to Wallace, Darwin had of course discovered natural selection many years earlier.

He was therefore horrified when he received Wallace's letter and immediately appealed to his influential friends Lyell and Joseph Hooker for advice on what to do.

Lyell and Hooker decided to present Wallace's essay, along with two unpublished excerpts from Darwin's writings on the subject, to a meeting of the Linnean Society of London on 1 July 1858.
