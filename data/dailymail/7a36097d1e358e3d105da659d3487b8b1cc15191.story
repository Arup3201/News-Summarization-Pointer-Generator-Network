Horrifying surveillance footage has revealed a teenage girl being beaten up at a juvenile detention center by female guards.

Shannon Linn Abbot, 33, can be seen restraining the girl before body-slamming her against a concrete wall, throwing her to the floor and sitting on her upper body for more than ten minutes. Another woman sits on the girl's legs to keep her down.

The girl is finally allowed to get up from the ground where she staggers to her feet looking dazed and is given an ice pack for her swollen face at the Florida detention center.

Secret abuse: The two guards at the Milton Girls Juvenile Residential Facility in Florida were caught on CCTV slamming a teenage girl off a concrete wall

Shock: The guard then spins round and throws the girl to the floor with the full force of her weight

A police report said the 15-year-old did not appear to be resisting guards. The girl told authorities that she had been restrained for being disruptive in class.

During the time that she was pinned to the floor, several employees walk through the room and casually stop to chat to the guards sitting on top of the teenager.

One staff member even pulls up a seat and appears to try to converse with the girl while she is still restrained on the floor.

When the girl is finally allowed to stand up she is given an ice-pack, according to the police report, as her eye is swollen shut.

Although Abbott was arrested after the abuse on August 9, she posted bail and returned to her job the following day - before the Department of Juvenile Justice stepped in this week and asked for her to be removed from contact with children.

Abbot, who was a guard at the Milton Girls Juvenile Residential Facility, was charged with battery causing great bodily harm.Â 

No charges were brought against the other guard who has not been identified.

Arrested: Shannon Linn Abbot, 33, was charged with battery after her unprovoked attack on a minor in August - but she was back at work the following day before the Department of Juvenile Justice stepped in

Oblivious: The two female guards pinned the girl to the floor with the full force of their weight for more than ten minutes while a number of employees casually walk past and stop for conversations

Chat: Another employee pulls up a chair and appears to have a discussion with the 15-year-old while she is restrained

Injured: The 15-year-old can be seen staggering to her feet on CCTV at the juvenile facility in Florida

Unseen: The girl was given an ice pack after the attack as her eye had swollen shut. No one reported the incident until she called the hotline

The center is privately run and is under investigation following the abuse.

Wansley Walters, from the DJJ, told the Miami Herald: 'We are deeply concerned that the 
incident, as depicted in the video... contradicts its description to us 
by officials representing the facility.

'We are also troubled that the 
facility did not officially report the incident to DJJ until two days 
after it occurred, and only when the victim called the [Department of 
Children & Families] abuse hotline. This lapse is inexplicable.'

Ms Walters added that the incident made her 'sick' and the fact that other employees did not appear to see the incident as anything extraordinary caused great cause for concern.
