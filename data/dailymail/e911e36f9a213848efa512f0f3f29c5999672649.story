Nasa should focus on a manned mission to Mars, and consider partneting with China on space missions, according to a new review of the human space flight program.

The National Research Council report, commissioned by the U.S. space agency Nasa, recommends a stepping stone approach toward Mars that builds technological know-how through a series of well-defined preliminary missions.

The space agency backed the report, saying 'There is a consensus that our horizon goal should be a human mission to Mars.'

Nasa's chief scientist Dr Ellen Stofan has revealed the agency plans to land humans on Mars in the next 20 years. To get there she says there are a number of technological milestones that must be reached, including sending astronauts to an asteroid, to ensure the crew's survival

All options begin with the International Space Station, a $100 billion research complex flying 250 miles (400 km) above Earth, the 286-page report released in Washington D.C., said.

One path includes Nasa's current plan to robotically capture an asteroid, redirect it into a high orbit around the moon and send astronauts there to explore.

The report suggests that path continue with missions to the moons of Mars, then on to Martian orbit and finally to the surface of the planet.

But two other paths would be less technologically daunting, NRC panel co-chairman Jonathan Lunine of Cornell University told reporters during a webcast press conference.

Nasa could follow the International Space Station program, which currently costs the United States about $3 billion a year, with a series of lunar sorties, an outpost on the moon and then to Mars, the report said.

The last path has the most stops en route to Mars, but poses the least technological risk since milestones have to be met along the way.

That option would follow the space station with human missions to an orbit beyond the moon, then to an asteroid in its native orbit, then to the lunar surface, the moons of Mars, Martian orbit and then to Mars itself.

Nasa would find an asteroid which is between seven and 10m wide.

They would then tow or push it towards Earth so that it ends up in a stable orbit near the moon.

In
 2021 astronauts would then use an Orion capsule - a manned spacecraft -
 to land on the asteroid and bring back soil and rock samples for 
analysis.

This asteroid would also, probably in the 2030s, be used as a stop-off point for astronauts on their way to Mars.

Exact
 details on how Nasa plans to pluck an asteroid out of its trajectory 
are not yet known, but the most recent rendering rendering shows it is 
captured and held inside what looks like a giant plastic bag.

The mission involves astronauts 
making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the
 next-generation Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle.

After the Orion and the asteroid are attached, the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object.

Once
 the Orion docks with the remote-operated asteroid capture device, the 
crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the 
conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take 
photos of and scoop samples from, the video shows.

After
 the mission is complete, Orion returns to Earth on the same path it 
journeyed out on, loops around the moon included, and splashes down in 
an ocean – likely the Pacific – 10 days later, as seen in the video.

Nasa said it supports the panel’s findings.

'There is a consensus that our horizon goal should be a human mission to Mars,' the agency said in a statement.

'The pathways thrust of the report complements Nasa's ongoing approach.'

All options will depend heavily on international, private sector and other partnerships, according to the report titled “Pathways to Exploration - Rationales and Approaches for a U.S. Program of Human Space Exploration.”

'We’re really talking about international collaboration of a different scale than what has been conducted in the past,' Lunine said.

In particular, the United States’ current relationship with China, which is not a member of the 15-nation space station partnership, needs to be reassessed, the report said.

'Given the rapid development of China’s capabilities in space, it is in the best interests of the United States to be open to its inclusion in future international partnerships.'

Nasa's Orion capsule will be one of the key components of any future attempt to land on Mars. The capsule will be responsible for launching astronauts into space and ultimately returning them to Earth. It is pictured here at the Operations and Checkout Building at Nasa's Kennedy Space Center. Its first flight will occur in December

The panel gave no specific estimate of what a Mars mission would cost. But based on past space initiatives, the public would support the endeavor.

'There is a temptation to rush to the question of dollars,' panel co-chairman and former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels said.

'Dollars is the secondary question.'

The pathways approach to Mars is 'a very different way of doing business,' Lunine said.

Last week, Nasa Chief scientist Dr Ellen Stofan, in a series of talks across the UK, outlined the plans of the agency to undertake such a mission in the next two decades.

Dr Stofan, however, as keen to stress the importance of being cautious when undertaking what would arguably be makind’s greatest accomplishment.

Other organisations such as the privately funded Mars One have claimed they will land humans on Mars by 2025, but have yet to reveal much research and development that indicates such a goal is achievable.

Nasa, meanwhile, is taking the careful approach.

‘We want to make sure we get living astronauts to the surface of Mars,’ Dr Stofan said according to the Guardian.

‘For us, that is a non-negotiable position. There is a lot of work to do, that’s why we need all of the space agencies around the world working together.’
