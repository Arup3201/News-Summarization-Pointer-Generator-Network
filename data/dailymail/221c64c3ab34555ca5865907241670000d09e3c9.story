An ancient terracotta baby bottle shaped like a pig has been uncovered by Italian archaeologists.

The vessel, which can also be used as a baby’s rattle, is 2,400 years old and is thought to have belonged to a member of the Messapian tribe who lived in the south of Italy at the time.

The bottle, or ‘guttus’ has human-like eyes and terracotta balls in its stomach so it could become a rattle after a baby had finished drinking its meal from the quirky vessel.

A 2,400-year-old pig-shaped terracotta baby bottle, which can also be used as a rattle, has been uncovered by Italian archaeologists

It was found in a Messapian tomb in Manduria, near Taranto in Puglia, Italy – a region that was inhabited by the Messapian people in around 1,000 BC – along with a number of other objects.

The stone tomb, which measures eight by four square feet and is decorated with bands of blue, red and ochre, contained the remains of two people.

The Messapians typically buried family members together and there were also remains of a later burial in the same tomb.

‘We found some skeletal remains piled in an angle. Other remains, related to a later burial, occupied the entire tomb,’ Arcangelo Alessio of the Archaeological Superintendency of Puglia told Discovery News.

The team of archaeologists found 30 objects in the tomb, including two terracotta figurines of females, three baby bottles, including the unusual pig-shaped one, as well as jars, vases, laps and plates, which have now been cleaned and restored.

A black basin and iron knife suggest a 
male burial, while a traditional vase called a trozzella, suggests a 
female was also laid to rest in the tomb as the vase is often found in 
tombs of women at the time.

However, the presence of the baby bottles and the female figures suggests a newborn girl might have been buried there too, as the figures were often placed in the graves of young girls.

Archaeologist Gianfranco Dimitri told Discovery News: ‘We might speculate that the female individual was pregnant at the time of death.’

He thinks it will be difficult to ascertain whether the bottle did belong to a baby, as it is probable that any baby’s bones have completely decomposed.

Dr Alessio said ‘Analysis of the funerary objects and their context suggest that the two burials followed one another in the Hellenistic period, between the end of the fourth and the third-second centuries BC.’
