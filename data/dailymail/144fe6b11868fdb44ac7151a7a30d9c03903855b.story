A former high school football captain has revealed for the first time how being abused by a female teacher shattered his dreams of playing at college level and changed his future.

Cameron Clarkson, 22, attended Catholic Cretin-Derham Hall in St Paul, Minnesota for four years where he eventually led the state-title winning Raiders football team.

However Mr Clarkson's dreams of going on to play at college came crashing down when he was targeted at the age of 16 by substitute teacher and weight room supervisor Gail Gagne.

Mr Clarkson is now suing the school for not doing more to protect him from the 25-year-old teacher. Gagne is also facing a lawsuit.

Cameron Clarkson (pictured left this week) attended Catholic Cretin-Derham Hall in St Paul, Minnesota. When he was 16  he had a relationship with a 25-year-old substitute teacher which had a damaging effect on him

What began as a friendship between Gagne and the teenage boy over the summer of 2008 while he worked in the weights room, developed when the 25-year-old told the teen she had feelings for him.

She is the daughter of former wrestler Greg Gagne and her grandfather is wrestling legend Verne Gagne.

The sophomore and 25-year-old teacher began having sex at her parents' home and at a motel but the liaisons began to have a deeply unsettling effect on the schoolboy. 

In a new interview with Fox, he said: 'It got to the point where I didn't like sneaking around or feeling like I was doing something wrong, as much as I found her attractive. Getting food, rides home, feeling like the cool guy; it didn't feel right.'

The former football player said that rumors began to circulate at the esteemed school and left him with the reputation of a 'teacher f*****' and a pervert. 

Finally, a girl whom Clarkson was interested in went to the police about the teacher's affair with the student. 

Gagne lost her job at the prestigious school and Clarkson was targeted by bullies. 

His mother's car was vandalized, Fox reported, and the teacher's name bleached into his home's front yard. 

He said that after using marijuana to numb the pain, he headed to Howard University in DC so that he could get away from Minnesota.

The student told Fox: 'I had to get away from this life, from this Cameron. I don't look like a victim of sexual abuse.'

In 2011, at the age of 28, Gagne received a stayed jail sentence of one year and a $300 fine for having sex with the high school athlete. She served one year of probation. 

As part of a deal with prosecutors, Gagne waived her right to a jury trial after admitting sex with the student while she was working as a weight room supervisor.

In exchange, the judge found her guilty of a reduced charge of fifth-degree criminal sexual conduct -- a gross misdemeanor -- and dropped a felony charge of third-degree criminal sexual conduct.

Gagne's father Greg (pictured left) and her grandfather Verne (right) both made careers are professional wrestlers 

Gagne registered as a sex offender in both California and Minnesota. She will never be allowed to work with minors again. 

Attorney Mike Freeman said at the time: 'A parent who sends their child to be taught and participate in activities to be coached ought not be worried about whether the coach is going to have sexual relations with that child. Period.' 

Mr Cameron is now suing his former teacher and school over the damaging effects the sexual relations had on his life. 

A settlement has not been reached with the school so a court date has been set for December 1.  

MailOnline was awaiting a statement from Cretin-Derham Hall on Tuesday.
