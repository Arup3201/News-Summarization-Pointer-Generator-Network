Sir Dave Brailsford has leapt to the defence of Andy Flower in the Kevin Pietersen storm, arguing that big personalities sometimes have to be excluded for the benefit of the team.

Former England coach Flower has been heavily criticised for what has been seen in some quarters as a failure to manage a maverick personality like Pietersen in a dressing room environment.

But Brailsford has admitted he omitted Sir Bradley Wiggins from the Team Sky Tour de France team this year because of the issues that exist between the 2012 Tour winner and 2013 champion, Chris Froome.

Asked specifically about Flower and Pietersen on Wednesday, the man who has masterminded Great Britain's phenomenal cycling success on the road and the track over the past decade said: 'Sport is all about managing difficult personalities. The best sports people in the world aren't normal people. So you're bound to get difficult scenarios and conflict.

'I've never met Kevin Pietersen, but I do know Andy Flower. I rate Andy Flower.

'I can't draw a conclusion or comment because I don't know the full story or the full detail of the facts. But we shouldn't forget that he's had a fantastic run at managing the national team.

'You're always going to have a degree of conflict when you're managing very, very driven individuals.

'You've got to decide if you want a team and if being a team is the optimal way of winning. And if you've got somebody who is contrary to that process of having a team, you've got to think very carefully about what you're trying to do.

'We all face challenges over time, in all walks of life. When you've got flair players, or big characters, the guys who don't quite fit. It's a challenge for all of us to try to marry those into a team. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

'Ultimately what we think about a lot of the time is team. I'm more inclined to think about what we want to win.

'If you get the right guys, they're motivated, passionate about it, we put the right group together, the team will look after itself.

'You have to have the values and the team aspect of it, but ultimately you get people driven.

'There's an element, if we're not careful, of the whole team ethic and values which doesn't penetrate right down to individual performance on a day to day, granular level.'

Brailsford stressed that Flower's achievements should not be forgotten amid the controversy.

'I'm very sympathetic to Andy Flower,' he said. 'People forget that we hadn't won the Ashes for such a long time and he took us on a journey down to Australia and he took the Ashes back.

'I'm not a cricket aficionado, but, to me, I think he changed the mentality. From a pretty poor run, all of a sudden we were winning the Ashes and we were expected to win the Ashes.

'He's getting criticised for having not won the Ashes and we should stop and think about that. We're very much about the moment that we're in. Andy Flower did a fantastic job as far as I can see.'

Brailsford received criticism for omitting Sir Bradley Wiggins from Team Sky's Tour de France team this year

Wiggins' fractious relationship with Chris Froome was the reason behind his exclusion from the Tour de France

Speaking at the Leaders in Sport conference at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday, Brailsford admitted he omitted Wiggins because of his fractured relationship with Froome.

Brailsford faced some criticism for excluding Wiggins, particularly after Froome crashed out only a few days into the race.

But Brailsford says he had to put the feelings of team leader Froome first, and felt the inclusion of Wiggins in the nine man team when they clearly loathe one another would be counter-productive.

'You can have a nice popular team if you want but popularity doesn't always win,' said Brailsford in clear reference to the disappointment felt that Wiggins would not be riding the three English stages of this year's Tour.

'Forget Kevin Pietersen,' he said. 'I had a few of my own to deal with, and there are challenges.

'We had a tricky season with two big champions, big personalities - very driven.

'A number of times people said to me 'why don't you get Chris and Brad in a room, bang their heads together and tell them to get on with it'.

'That would have been the easiest thing to do. But over three weeks in France you are travelling together in the morning, racing, then travelling after and eating together. It would have been like a Big Brother scenario.

'I had to ask myself if that was going to be optimal for the team in that environment. And the answer was no.

Brailsford and Team Sky have had a disappointing year following their back-to-back wins at the Tour

'Our best chance of winning the Tour lay in Chris's hands and I had to build the team around Chris.

'You get challenging scenarios; difficult decisions that can be fairly uncomfortable. But my analysis was, do we want to win?'

After a difficult year for Sky – that followed back-to-back wins at the Tour – Brailsford said he was considering ripping up the blueprint that has delivered so much success and starting again. 'I'm not trying to work out what a sports team in 2020 is going to look like,' he said.

He also said Wiggins would be targeting the iconic hour record in June. 'There is a plan for him to do it and I'm sure he can do it,' said Brailsford.

'When you look at the riders who could go for the hour record, and feasibly achieve a better distance than Jens Voigt's just achieved, then I think Bradley's probably one of the most accomplished.'
