Prince Harry is expected to announce he will join a group of wounded soldiers trekking to the South Pole. 

The official launch of the Walking With The Wounded polar challenge will be held this week and even though the 28-year-old prince has not yet publicly spoken about taking part it is thought he may join the participants because he is also a patron of the charity. 

In March 2011, he joined an amputee team which trekked to the North Pole alongside Captain Disney, 30, who lost his right leg in battle.

Captain Disney told The Telegraph: 'I know he'd want to be involved. He's a soldier - of course he'd love to do this. But first and foremost I'd like him to be there because he is a really good bloke.'

Prince Harry, or Captain Wales as he is known in the military, was involved in a two-part documentary called Harry's Heroes which was filmed during the trip to the North Pole.

He had to cut the expedition short because of his brother William's wedding. 

During the documentary he said: 'These guys have been to hell and back and come out the other side. 

'They are amazing, absolutely astonishing; the inspiration they give to everyone is unbelievable.

'I guess I have three different lives. One is my military life, one is my private life, one is the public stuff. But me as a military man is my number one favourite, because I get to spend time with people like this.'

Prince Harry entered the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in May 2005.

He successfully completed a 44-week training course as an Officer Cadet, before being commissioned in April 2006 as a Second Lieutenant in the Household Cavalry (Blues and Royals).

In February 2008 he went on to complete more than two months service with the British Army in Helmand province, Afghanistan, as a Forward Air Controller for NATO forces and was promoted from Second Lieutenant to Lieutenant in April 2008.

In January 2009 he began a two-and-a-half year training course to become a fully operational, full-time Army Air Corps helicopter pilot.

He remains an officer in the Household Cavalry during the training period.

The expedition will take place as a race between a British team, a U.S. team and a team representing the Commonwealth countries Canada and Australia. 

Following extensive training, from cold weather training in Iceland in March, to team training through the summer and a final session of snow preparation in October, the teams will fly to Antartica in November.

They aim to reach the South Pole around December 17.

In a statement released ahead of Friday's launch, Prince Harry said: 'Walking With The Wounded continues to champion our extraordinary wounded service personnel and highlight their determination and courage to face future challenges following injury on the battlefield, whether physical or cognitive. 

'Their inspirational expeditions have already impacted so many and I hope they will continue to impact many more.

'I am delighted to be Patron of the Allied South Pole Challenge, their latest ambitious project. Not only will this involve wounded personnel from the United Kingdom, but there will be a team from the United States and a team from the Commonwealth. This means the awareness created will be global, and will not only show the tenacity of these young men and women, but also the strong links between our Allies, off the battlefield as well as on.

'The Allied Challenge in 2013 promises to be a quite remarkable endeavour. I urge everyone to get behind the expedition and ‘Support the Walk’.
