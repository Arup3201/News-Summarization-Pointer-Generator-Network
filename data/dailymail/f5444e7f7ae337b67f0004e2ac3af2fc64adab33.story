An immigrant is suing the Government for £11million for making him unhappy after he and his family were ordered to leave the country.

In what appears to be a legal first, Daniel Kiunsi has issued a High Court writ for the distress he says he has suffered since the decision to eject him.

He claims officials violated his human rights by confiscating his passport three years ago and says it caused his family ‘great unhappiness’.

Complaint: Daniel Kiunsi, whose home is pictured, has issued a High Court writ for the distress he says he has suffered since the decision to eject him

Mr Kiunsi, who is still here, 
complains that the state has failed to provide the family with their 
‘basic needs’ of accommodation and food, so he has had to pay rent, 
council tax and other living expenses himself.

The electrical engineer from Tanzania 
says he has ‘scientifically calculated’ the appropriate figure to 
compensate him and has reached the figure of exactly £11million.

Conservative MP Philip Davies 
yesterday described the case as ‘outrageous’ and added: ‘The whole thing
is completely ridiculous. This just goes to show how so many people see
the UK as a soft touch.’

No comment: Kiunsi's daughter told the Daily Mail her father did not want to talk about the case

The case revolves around a Home Office decision to strip Mr Kiunsi and his family of the right to live in Britain in May 2009.

Mr Kiunsi arrived in the UK with his wife and three children from Tanzania on a work visa.

But the Home Office revoked his right 
to live in Britain when he breached the terms of the visa by returning 
to the UK after working abroad.

The UK Border Agency confiscated his 
passport but allowed him in to the country after he gave assurances that
he and his family would return to Africa.

Officials said he would be able to collect his passport when he left the country, but he remained living in Britain.

Now Mr Kiunsi is demanding the right 
to stay in the country as well as compensation for the ‘torture, inhuman
and degrading treatment’ he has received from the UK authorities, 
citing the controversial Human Rights Act.

He is understood to be citing his right to liberty, a fair trial and a private and family life to mount his case.

Last night Mr Kiunsi, who is in his 
forties, was unavailable for comment at his large, red-brick terraced 
home in a  tree-lined street in Upminster, Essex, when approached by the
Daily Mail.

Miserable: Kiunsi says the UK Government's decision to seize his passport has caused him 'great unhappiness'

Requests to members of his family for 
an interview via telephone went unanswered, but a young lady at the 
£222,000 home, who identified herself as Mr Kiunsi’s daughter, told the 
Mail: ‘My father does not want to talk about this.’

However, he is reported to have said: ‘It’s the issue of the happiness.’

The Home Office has vowed to fight the case.

A UK Border Agency spokesman said: ‘We
are aware that Mr Kiunsi has made an application and we will seek to 
challenge this robustly at every stage’.

In a recent report by the US 
government, Tanzania was judged to have serious human rights problems 
including  the use of excessive force by  military personnel, police and
prison guards.

The report also highlighted the 
country’s ‘harsh and life-threatening prison conditions, lengthy 
pre-trial detention, judicial corruption and inefficiency, restrictions 
on freedoms of the Press and assembly and restrictions on the movement 
of refugees.’
