Two parents and their two young children filmed a music video spoofing Sir Mix-a-Lot's song 'Baby Got Back.'

In the clip for 'Baby Got Class,' father Penn Holderness raps lyrics about his two children going back to school, while wife Kim Dean Holderness and their youngsters Penn Charles and Lola dance nearby.

Holderness
 raps G-rated lyrics in the clip, which include 'I like big buses, I 
cannot lie/Some other parents may deny/But when a big yellow one comes 
around the bend/And picks up our children we get sprung.'

'I like big buses, I cannot lie!' The Holderness family raps and dances in their Sir Mix-a-Lot spoof

Flow: Father Penn Holderness raps the lyrics, while wife Kim Dean Holderness, along with their children Penn Charles and Lola, dance along

The song is set to the music from Sir Mix-a-Lot's song, which served as an ode to women with large rear ends. The song was recently sampled by Nicki Minaj for her new single 'Anaconda.'

At the family's website, theholdernessfamily.com, Penn wrote in a post 'If there was one of those facebook relationship status options for my children, at this point in August, I would choose “needs to see other people.” On both sides — we literally need to see other people.

'It’s been an amazing summer but for our children and ourselves — we are ready for the routine the school year brings.'

The father's post later maintained the feeling is mutual.

'Our kids had a full summer of camps, play dates, fun babysitters, and a few work trips with mom and dad,' he wrote. 'We’ve spent A LOT of time with them — and we’ve treasured every (almost every) minute.

'Just as much as WE are ready to walk them to the classroom door -THEY are ready to go.'

Back-to-school: Penn wrote online he and his family 'need to see other people' following time spent together this summer

Tough: Part of the parody video talks about the difficulties of back-to-school shopping for the Holderness family's two children

The video shows the Holderness family in multiple locations, including the back of a school bus and inside a store shopping for school supplies.

Toward the end of the clip, the Holderness children are seen boarding the school bus.

A word message also appears, which says the video is 'dedicated to the amazing teachers who take care of our kids all year and don't make enough money.'

In December, MailOnline reported the Holderness family posted another rap video that was in the form of a holiday greeting.
