A cargo ship grounded off the New Zealand coast since October has split in two, spilling sea containers and debris and sparking fears of a fresh oil spill, maritime officials said.

The wreck of the Greek-owned Rena was described as New Zealand's worst maritime environmental disaster even before the rear section of the ship, lashed by pounding seas, broke away yesterday.

The ship previously spilled heavy fuel oil that fouled pristine North Island beaches and killed up to 20,000 seabirds, and despite salvage efforts nearly 400 tons of oil remain onboard.

Split in two: The wreck of the Greek-owned Rena was described as New Zealand's worst maritime environmental disaster even before the rear section of the ship broke away

Maritime officials said the front section of the wreck remains stuck in its original position, but the stern section slipped at least 100ft away from the bow and is 'moving significantly,' pounded by 19ft swells.

The storm that split the vessel will continue for another three to four days, Maritime New Zealand spokesman Ross Henderson said.

Officials said up to 300 of the roughly 880 containers that had been on board were lost when the ship broke apart.

Of those, about 30 per cent had been fitted with monitoring devices and some 30 containers had already been located.

The storm that split the vessel will continue for another three to four days, Maritime New Zealand spokesman Ross Henderson said

Environment Minister Nick Smith said there is roughly 385 tons of oil still aboard the ship

Oil has been seen leaking from the 
broken ship. Alex van Wijngaarden, on-scene commander for the national 
response team, said oil from the vessel could come ashore last night.

'While
reports at this stage indicate there has not been a significant release
of oil, with the Rena in its current fragile state, a further release 
is likely,' he said.

'While
it is unknown at this stage exactly how much oil may be released, teams
have been mobilized and will be ready to respond to anything that may 
come ashore.'

Environment Minister Nick Smith said that the 'risks for the environment are a fraction of what they were in October,' though the roughly 385 tons of oil still aboard the ship is about the same amount that leaked from the vessel soon after it ran aground.

Salvage crews previously removed 1,100 tons of oil from the ship.

Most of the oil is in tanks in the stern section, which could end up sinking. Some of that oil could end up dissipating in the ocean rather than washing up on beaches.

The containers, meanwhile, spilled goods including timber, wool, bales of recycled plastic and bags of milk powder. The debris could begin washing ashore later Sunday.

Some containers have been sighted floating up to 20 miles northwest of the stricken ship, Port of Tauranga chief executive Mark Cairns said.

'They have been caught in a strong coastal current' fueled by the storm, he said.

The Rena ran aground on Astrolabe Reef 14 miles from Tauranga Harbour on North Island on October 5.

Salvage crews have plucked 389 of the ship's 1,370 loaded cargo containers from its decks since it ran aground, while some 98 have been washed over board in the past three months.

One eyewitness, Warwick Roberts, said the rear section was sliding along the reef.

The 'stern has reared up and center section is not visible. Large breaking waves observed on bow,' he said.

Clean up: Soldiers worked to clear away the oil spill from the beach in Taurange, New Zealand, as environmentalists warned of a potential wildlife disaster

Removal: Bulldozers and diggers have been drafted on to Waihi beach to take away the shipping containers

In trouble: Rescuers have been unable to properly reach the ship due to the severe structural damage it has suffered

Destruction: Washed up container roll slowly up to the beach

Investigators were unable to explain how the vessel managed to perch itself on a New Zealand reef before the split

A two-mile no-go zone is in force around the wreck.

Investigations last month revealed that Australian authorities impounded the vessel, but released it the next day after Liberian maritime authorities intervened, essentially saying the ship was safe to sail and the problems could be fixed later. The Rena, like many ships, is registered in Liberia.

Some 10 weeks later, the Rena ran full-steam into a well-marked reef off the coast of New Zealand. It's not clear whether the previously identified problems played any role.

The captain and Rena's navigating officer face criminal charges of operating a ship in a dangerous or risky manner, polluting the environment and altering the ship's documents after the crash.

Other items from the containers washed up in Tauranga, New Zealand included these deer skins

Rescuers have been trying to get near the vessel to transfer away the ship's oil since October
