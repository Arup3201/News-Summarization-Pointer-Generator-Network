Samsung has unveiled its latest smartwatch which will double up as a TV remote and a fitness tracker as it tries to overcome the problems which plagued its first offering.

The Gear 2, and sister device the Gear 2 Neo, will let users track their heart rate while exercising, offer fitness coaching and allow people to design their own workout routines.

A built in LED will also let people control other electrical devices, such as their TV.

The Samsung Gear 2 (right two watches) and Gear 2 Neo (left three watches) feature a camera built into the watch face, as well as a fitness tracker and LED which allows them to be used as a remote control

Simon Stanford, vice president of Samsung UK & Ireland, said: 'Samsung continues to lead in the wearable technology market with innovative, creative devices that are completely integrated into the lives of our customers.

'Offering extended connectivity features, stylish customisation options and a robust application network, we have enhanced everything that people love about the original Samsung Gear to create a second generation of wearable devices that offer unparalleled smart freedom.'

The new watch is the latest attempt by a technology firm to tempt buyers into the wearable tech market, which has yet to take off.

Samsung's first smartwatch, the Galaxy Gear, proved unpopular with customers because of its poor battery life, clunky camera, and limited range of apps

Users were also critical of the fact that, without a constant connection to your phone, the Gear doesn't work

Sales of Samsung's first attempt, the Galaxy Gear, have been disappointing due in part to its poor battery life, clunky camera built into the strap and limited selection of apps.

On the new Gear the camera has been moved on to the watch face, but it is unclear what customers will make of other improvements and additional features, such as a range of colours and customisable clock faces.

Other companies, such as Pebble, have managed to garner more critical success with their offerings, but that hasn't translated into large sales figures.

This latest fan mock-up of the iWatch appeared online as user speculate about the device. Apple has had issues developing the watch meaning the release date has been pushed back

Tech geeks have been creating mock-up ads as they await a release date. Apple reportedly had problems making some components and had to bring in outside help

Sony has just launched its new watch, the Smartwartch 2, which is less expensive and has longer battery life

Apple has reportedly run into number of problems developing its own 'iWatch', including difficulties making components, and has been forced to draft in outside help.

The watch is said to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, and may also feature Siri voice controls that let users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen.

The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet.

Part of the problem with wearable technology is the cost of shrinking the computer parts, with Google Glass costing $1,500 (£900)

Sony has also just released its new smartwatch, and Google are due to start shipping their offering in March, though that date could be pushed back.

Users have remained wary due to the high cost involved with shrinking the technology down, with Samsung's first Gear costing £300.

Other wearable tech products have similar shortcomings, with Google Glass, high-tech glasses with a built-in computer, costing $1,500 (£900).
