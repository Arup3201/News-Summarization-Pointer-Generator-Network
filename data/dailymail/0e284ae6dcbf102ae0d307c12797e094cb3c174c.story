What do you do with Steven Gerrard? It is a debate that has been raging for most of the season and shows no sign of ending.

Steven is no stranger to being a hot topic of conversation but, in all the years I've known him, I am struggling to remember a time when he has been scrutinised to this extent.

Some critics believe he should be out of the picture. Others couldn't be without him. Where do I stand? Well, put it this way, if Liverpool were playing in a major final now, Steven would be one of the first names I'd put down on the teamsheet. My reasons would have nothing do with sentiment.

Steven Gerrard is having a difficult season and here he trudges off after the home defeat by Chelsea

If Liverpool had a penalty or a free-kick in a dangerous area, Steven is the only person I'd want taking it. He's proven that against Ludogorets and Everton this season. He is also the man I'd pick to play a killer pass and the one I'd back over anyone else if he was racing through on goal.

The issue, however, is that at 34, he doesn't get into those positions as regularly as he once did. Furthermore, the dynamic of the deep-lying role he occupied last season has changed as Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge have not been around to provide outlets.

After his outstanding efforts last year, he has yet to reach the same levels – who has in a red shirt?

Steven is not a great protector of a defence. He's there to start attacks from deep rather than shield a defence as Dietmar Hamann or Javier Mascharano did for me.

Now, though, his age is being tied in with his form. I know what it is like to reach such a stage. I remember playing in a game against Arsenal in March 2012, when Robin van Persie scored a winning goal in the last minute at Anfield, and dealing with critics saying I was finished.

A week later at Sunderland, Kenny Dalglish took me out of the team. We lost again, this time 1-0, but my replacement, Sebastian Coates, struggled and I was recalled for the next game, against Everton. Steven scored a hat-trick as we won 3-0.

It was after the Everton game I realised it was best that I'd been taken out of the firing line at Sunderland. There is a saying in football, 'You have your best games when you don't play' and that was the case at The Stadium of Light. Your situation changes and people want you in the team.

I found that again last year, when people were saying to me Liverpool would have won the league had I stayed. Who knows whether they were right?

I knew when the end was coming. I had 18 months left on my contract and I knew I wouldn't sign another. Like Steven, I was mentally tough. But when you hear constant references to your age after a poor performance or a mistake, it becomes draining.

You go into games wondering, 'Am I going to be physically able to get through this?'. In your head, you have no worries about reading and understanding the game but when your legs go, they do not come back.

Brendan Rodgers and his medical staff have done a superb job managing Steven's fitness. Now they must manage the amount of matches he plays – Brendan, himself, admitted in midweek that Steven can't play three games in a week to the level he would like. Steven will have had similar thoughts.

Over the next 18 months, Brendan will have to start to take him off and leave him out for his own good. People have questioned whether the manager has the resolve to do so but history shows he makes big calls. Andy Carroll, Luis Suarez, Pepe Reina and I will testify to that.

But that isn't a bad thing for Steven. Can you imagine the reaction inside Anfield with 30 minutes of a tight game remaining and seeing No 8 getting stripped for action? With space to exploit and energy to change the game, he could be a lethal weapon.

Sir Alex Ferguson did it brilliantly with Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs, letting them miss the odd week, giving them 20 minutes from the bench and ensuring they were fresh for when he really needed them. That's what has to happen with Steven, who I am sure will sign a new deal.

Pako Ayestaran, Rafa Benitez's former assistant, summed it up perfectly once when talking to us about squad rotation. He said it wasn't important how many games you played in; what was crucial was the amount of good games you played.

Do not doubt Steven's ability to go on making contributions, but do not underestimate that he needs help. Take what is happening with Frank Lampard at Manchester City. He is surrounded by top players, is being used sensibly and his reputation continues to be enhanced.

Rio Ferdinand, by contrast, can't get a game for QPR. Who would have ever said that a player of Rio's quality would see his time out on the bench at Loftus Road? You need assistance when you reach that stage and Rio isn't getting it.

Steven's situation is somewhere in the middle of Frank and Rio. Liverpool need to sign a top defensive midfielder in the near future and it should not be that, on the 16th anniversary of his first appearance, he is still being looked to provide the inspiration.

When the end finally came for me, against QPR in May 2013, it was a relief. I also had the added bonus that I had been playing well and was able to finish on my own terms.

For his immense contribution, Steven deserves more. He might not do what the other members of Liverpool's top three all-time players did in their final appearances – Kenny Dalglish lifted the league, Graeme Souness hoisted the European Cup – but his journey has to end on a high.

It is a huge blow for Jack Wilshere to face another prolonged spell on the sidelines and Arsene Wenger will be cursing losing a top player for three months.

Wilshere was England’s outstanding performer in their last two matches, albeit against inferior opposition in Slovenia and Scotland, and won praise for the way he handled the holding midfield role.

He picked up this latest ankle injury by running through a packed midfield and, not for the first time, it is his ankle that is the problematic area.

I fear this will not be the last time he suffers such an injury if he keeps playing an advanced role.

Every game I see him play, he seems to go down at some point after taking a buffeting. It is clearly having a detrimental impact.

The image Wilshere shared on his personal Instagram account showing Paddy McNair's challenge 

Wenger stated publicly after his performances for his country that playing in the holding role wasn’t Wilshere’s best position but the question that now has to be asked is this: will being deployed in a holding role prevent these long lay-offs?

I believe it will.

Wilshere could be back in training by February, but it will take some time to get back to full fitness 

This week I’m looking forward to… watching Southampton face their biggest test

Ronald Koeman's side have been given plenty of praise this season, attracting lots of admirers for the results they have secured, the signings they have made and the way they have played.

They are second in the table, boasting the best goals-against column in the country, and people are wondering whether they should really be taking them seriously as contenders to finish the campaign in a top-four position.

Now we are going to find out. After hosting Manchester City on Sunday, a trip to Arsenal — who they knocked out of the League Cup — beckons before Manchester United head to the South Coast on Monday week.

If they come through this period unscathed, their claims will be taken more seriously and I hope they do. Southampton have been the story of the season and it is remarkable they are up there after losing so many players and changing their manager.

I just wonder, however, whether the depth of their squad will count against them. More will become apparent in the next 10 days.
