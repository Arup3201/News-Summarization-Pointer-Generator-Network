Royal Bank of Scotland looks set for another row over pay for its casino banking staff following a year of shame for the company.

The bank, which is more than 80 per cent owned by the taxpayer, is under pressure to claw back £4m in shares owed to John Hourican, the head of the investment bank.

It is also thought that RBS is planning to pay bonuses worth £250m – an average of £21,000 for each of its 11,900 staff in the division, although so-called high-flyers will get far more.

That would be well down on the £390m 
it paid out for 2011 and £937m in 2010 but will still raise eyebrows in 
the wake of a series of scandals to hit the bank.

RBS (down 22p at 345.8p) is likely to 
be hit with a fine worth around £500m over its involvement in the Libor 
rate-rigging scandal – possibly as early as this week.

The share price fell yesterday after reports that criminal charges could be brought against the bank.

It is also facing a rising bill for its part in the mis-selling of payment protection insurance having already set aside £1.7bn.

And it has coughed up £175m following a
computer meltdown last summer which caused havoc for millions of 
customers at its NatWest, RBS and Ulster Bank branches.

Former business secretary Pat McFadden said today that bankers should pay all of the Libor fine.

‘There would be enormous anger if 
taxpayers had to foot the bill for the sins of RBS,’ he said. ‘If they 
are fined they should take it out of the bonus pool rather than the 
bank’s general resources.’

Unite chief Dominic Hook added: ‘It 
looks like ordinary bank workers and taxpayers will pay the price for 
the greed at the top of RBS. It is time (Chancellor) George Osborne put his foot 
down.’

Sacrifice: CEO Stephen Hester has waived his bonus for three of the past four years

RBS chief 
executive Stephen Hester agreed to waive his bonus for 2012 in the wake 
of the IT glitch. He could have got £2.4m on top of his £1.2m salary but
has now waived his bonus in three of the past four years since taking 
over at the bank after its £45bn bailout by the taxpayer.

But Whitehall officials are now pressuring RBS to claw back a deferred share package worth £4m owed to Hourican.

He is expected to leave the company shortly as part of a restructuring of the investment banking arm.

But his departure could also be part 
of an attempt to draw a line under the Libor scandal – even though the 
settlement with US and UK regulators is not likely to implicate any 
senior figures.

Sources close to the bank said the RBS
case was ‘not the same situation as at Barclays’ where disgraced chief 
executive Bob Diamond was forced to stand down.

They also insisted the £4m owed to 
Hourican is not a ‘payout’ but instead shares he has already earned 
since he joined the bank in 2009.

An RBS source also said that no 
decision has been made on bonus payments as yet - but a £250m pot would
represent another fall and is well below what rivals earn at other 
banks.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls wrote in the Daily Mirror today: ‘There should be fair rewards for performance. But these bonuses are bound to cause concern after the interest rate fixing scandals.’
