Six months after announcing his breakup with fashion blogger Garance Dore, The Sartorialist's Scott Schuman has finally revealed why the once loved-up couple chose to call time on their highly-publicized relationship – and why they decided to officially announce their split by posting statements online.

The street style photographers, who met at Paris Fashion Week in 2007, were together for seven years before revealing on their respective blogs last August that they had gone their separate ways. 

Mr Schuman, 47, told Isaac Likes that he and Miss Dore didn't want end their relationship on their blogs, but they felt like they had to in order to 'make it clear that there was no scandal'.

'We felt that we were fine, everything’s cool, and we’re still good friends, so we didn’t want anyone else to think or suggest otherwise,' he said. 'It wasn’t easy to do. We didn’t like doing it, It wasn’t fun for either one of us, but out of respect we decided to do it that way.'

Mr Schuman also noted that he and Miss Dore had broken up a 'little bit' before they released their separate statements.

The photographer explained that they decided to make their separation public because it happened just a few weeks before fashion week and they wanted to avoid being seated together at shows.

'We’re fine, but when you’re just freshly broken up you don’t necessarily want to sit next to your ex-girlfriend at a fashion show,' he said.

According to Mr Schuman, he and Miss Dore 'still text' and 'still get along' – and he even admitted to recently contacting his ex to get her opinion on a potential job.

'She’ll never be out of my life, but it’s tough because I still think she’s great. It’s one of those tough things when you see a girl that you still really like but you can’t make it work.'

He added that they were just brought up differently and he 'can't blame her for anything'.  

Always amicable: Six months after their breakup, Mr Schuman said that they still communicate. He also noted that he still thinks his ex is 'great'

Mr Schuman launched The Sartorialist in 2005, while Miss Dore started her eponymous blog a year later.

Shortly after they met in 2007, Mr Schuman left his wife of 20 years. He and Miss Dore began dating within months, and she eventually left her home France and moved to New York to be with him.

In 2012, the duo won a CFDA media award for their work and cemented their status as a fashion power couple.

But two years later, Mr Schuman and Miss Dore had taken to their blogs to share short statements about their separation.

'We’ve shared so much of our creative life (and more) with you, our readers, so we thought it was right to let you know about it,' Miss Dore wrote on her site.

Mr Schuman added: 'Our mutual respect and admiration for each other have left us still great friends.'
