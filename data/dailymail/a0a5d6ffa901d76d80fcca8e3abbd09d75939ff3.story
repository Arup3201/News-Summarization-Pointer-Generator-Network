A 19-year-old college student who went missing four days ago has been found safe, police said today.

Adeline Munguia, 19, who attends California State University, vanished last Thursday afternoon after reportedly meeting a man through dating app Tinder.

A university spokesman told MailOnline today that the young woman was found with no signs of foul play in Montebello, California  - around eight miles from campus.

The 19-year-old college student was last seen boarding a bus from Cal State University to downtown LA. She was found today in Montebello - eight miles from campus

The investigation was ongoing into where the student had been and why she had not made contact, the spokesman said on Monday.

It is not clear if Miss Munguia, who is a California native, is from Montebello.

Police earlier told MailOnline that Miss 
Munguia lives in the college dorms and was last seen boarding an MTA bus
 by herself from the campus to downtown LA.

Detectives had been looking into all of her social networking activity for clues as to where the 19-year-old may have gone.

The officer said it was not known if the young woman shared details of where she was going or if she was meeting anyone with friends.

She was last seen on surveillance footage at 3.30pm on Thursday wearing a pink top with thin straps, black pants, open-toed shoes, carrying a beige and brown purse. She appeared to be looking down at her phone.

Tinder is a dating app where potential dates connect with each other using profiles with limited information - typically just a few pictures, first name and how close geographically that person is to you. The app was launched by college students in California last year.

Users 'swipe' a potential date's profile to the right on their smartphone screens if they like it.

If two people do the same, they can then instant message each other to arrange a meeting.

Tinder is a location-based social networking app that allows mutually interested users to link up with each other - simply by swiping the screen of their smartphone.

It has quickly become known as a dating and even a 'hook up' app with 1.5billion profiles created since its launch.

Of those, 5 million users are now accessing the app on average seven times per day.

The app is currently generating 10 million matches every day.

Tinder was launched at a campus party at the University of Southern California in 2012.

It quickly spread to other college campuses before catching on among the wider population. It is most popular with men and women aged 18-35.

Tinder is the fastest growing free dating app in the U.S.

Once the app is downloaded on to a smart phone, users are asked by the app to allow access to their Facebook profile.

An individual's Tinder profile (like the example pictured right) is then set up using just a first name, age, sexual orientation and a handful of photos.

Immediately the faces of people between a certain age range and within a certain radius  appear on screen.

Each individual uses their touch-screen phone to 'swipe' that face to the right if they like it, and left if they don't. The face profiles then continue in a steady stream.

If both users swipe to 'like' each other, a chat box appears - and a private conversation can begin.
