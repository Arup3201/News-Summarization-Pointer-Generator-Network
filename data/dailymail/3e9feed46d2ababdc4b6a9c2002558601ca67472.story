A heavily pregnant Jenna Bush Hager appeared on the Today Show this morning, presenting one of her last stories before she takes maternity leave.

So far the glowing 31-year-old has tried to conceal her baby bump with shapeless shift dresses, but todayÂ  the eight months pregnant mother-to-be decided on a blue, figure-hugging, cap-sleeve dress.

While at times she sat with her arms crossed protectively over the bump, she seemed mostly unafraid to show off her new figure with animated hand gestures, smiling and commenting to Matt Lauer: 'Eight months pregnant, woo!'

Eight months: A heavily pregnant Jenna Bush Hager appeared on the Today Show this morning, presenting one of her last stories before she takes maternity leave

The daughter of former president George W. Bush, was all smiles when she announced her pregnancy with husband Henry Hager, 34, in December.

And today, she beamed while reading excerpts from some of her 88-year-old grandfathers most personal letters, which have been compiled in an autobiographical book called All the Best.

'My grandfather has always been a lover of words, a poetic letter writer,' Mrs Bush Hager said of the 41st president, George Bush.

Some of the letters include declarations of love to his grandchildren, lengthy pages written back home during his time in World War II, and even political memos to royalty and heads of state.

Mrs Bush Hager's twin sister, Barbara, read excerpts from one letter addressed to her ten years ago aloud, through tears.

'October 12, 2003, subject: Leaving and 
crying,' she read. 'I think about you all an awful lot, I wonder how each of you is 
doing in life, and college and school. If you need me I am here for you because I love you very much.'

Her cousin Lauren Bush, who recently married designer Ralph Lauren's son, David, also read a letter from her grandfather aloud.

'I'm a very happy gampy. As you know I've had to give up fly fishing off the rocks, but there is plenty left to do, plenty wonderful things,' she recited.

Mrs Bush Hager explained that the former president would often use his letters as a medium for humor during his days as commander and chief from 1989 to 1993.

Happily married: Mr Bush's wife, Barbara, wrote on their wedding anniversary: 'Let's see Barb, 42 years ago meant that I was a nervous wreck. You too, maybe... I'm a very happy guy. The luckiest in the world, actually'

She added: 'He often closed his letters honoring his young daughter Robin, who died from cancer.'

To his wife, Barbara, he wrote on their wedding anniversary: 'Let's see Barb, 42 years ago meant that I was a nervous wreck. You too, maybe. Anyway, here we are 42 years later, and I'm a very happy guy. The luckiest in the world, actually.'

Mrs Bush Hager and her husband, who got married in 2008 on former President Bush's Texas ranch, now reside in Manhattan, will be celebrating their fifth wedding anniversary in June.

The busy mother-to-be is an editor-at-large for Southern Living magazine as well as a contributing correspondent on the Today show. The baby will be the first grandchild for George W. and Laura Bush.
