At times during the summer, Southampton looked like a club recently visited by Vikings. 

The fact they now sit inside the top four has shocked even their own players, with Morgan Schneiderlin admitting he never imagined they would recover so quickly from such drastic surgery.

It was telling, also, that the Frenchman claimed: 'I’m happy here, I’m fully focused on Southampton and there is no problem'. It's some statement from a player who pouted about being kept in the summer when other leading lights were getting big moves elsewhere.

But Southampton's run of three Premier League wins has lifted much of the gloom, even if the latest in that streak was arguably their weakest performance of the season.

Southampton laboured for 41 minutes against 10 men before Victor Wanyama scored the 80th-minute winner and gave Ronald Koeman cause to remind supporters 'it is very early in the season'.

Schneiderlin has been here before, having started last season strongly, but believes it is key that the new squad make a better fist of the winter fixtures.

He said: 'It’s a surprise to have got off to the best ever start in the league after going through so many changes in the summer.

Southampton have failed to score in only one of their past 16 league away games.

'The coaching staff changed, a lot of players left so of course it’s great for us to be in such a good position after five games, but it’s only five games of a long season and we need to keep going.

'We had a very good start last year as well but it was difficult after going through a hard time in December and after that it was difficult to get back up the league. We’re going to try to be stronger in that period.'

He added: 'The group is closer after the summer, a lot of people were saying that Southampton would struggle this season because we lost so many players.

'But we got together as a group after the transfer window shut and we said, “Right lads, it’s us now, we’re going to spend this year together and we need to show everyone that is doubting us that we can do something great”. We are doing it so far.'

Swansea manager Garry Monk was left bemused by referee Jonathan Moss, even if he did not object to Wilfried Bony's red card.

He said: 'His (Moss) performance, in terms of consistency on his decisions was very, very poor, extremely poor. In terms of consistency, it blew my mind at times.'

Garry Monk did not disagree with the decision but described the referee's overall performance as 'very poor'
