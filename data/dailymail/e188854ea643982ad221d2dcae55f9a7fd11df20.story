British officials have rejected US requests to use UK military bases for the growth of forces in the Gulf - as fears continue to grow over Iran’s nuclear capabilities, it was reported last night.

The Americans are also said to have asked to use British bases in Cyprus - and fly from US bases on the British territories of Ascension Island in the Atlantic Ocean and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.

But British ministers have referenced legal advice from the Attorney General, insisting Iran - which is still denying any plans for nuclear weapon development - does not pose ‘a clear and present threat’.

The key guidance - sent to the Ministry of Defence, Number 10 and the Foreign Office - added that helping forces who could be involved in a pre-emptive strike would be breaking international law.

‘The UK would be in breach of international law if it facilitated what amounted to a pre-emptive strike on Iran,’ a senior Whitehall source told the Guardian.

The US is not said to think a rise in the chances of conflict will happen soon - and it is believed the discussions with Britain have only been to find out their stance.

But one source said the US was ‘surprised’ Britain is ‘reluctant to provide assurances’ on assistance. ‘They'd expect resistance from senior Liberal Democrats, but it's Tories as well,’ the source stated.

The Royal Navy has a nuclear-powered submarine and up to nine other ships in the Gulf region, with counter-mine vessels on rotation to make sure the vital Strait of Hormuz shipping lanes stay open.

British military officials flew to Tampa, Florida, this summer to discuss contingency plans with the US, but had believed the UK would only be involved once conflict had begun, reported the Guardian.

The Foreign Office told the Daily Mail that the Government continues to insists that a military strike against Iran is not the right course of action at the moment, ‘although no option is off the table’.

A spokesman added: ‘We believe that the twin-track approach of pressure through sanctions, which are having an impact, and engagement with Iran is the best way to resolve the nuclear issue.

‘We are not going to speculate about scenarios in which military action would be legal.

'That would depend on the circumstances at the time.’

The Foreign Office would not reveal whether the Attorney General’s advice was requested.

A US state department official told the Guardian that the US and UK ‘co-ordinate on all kinds of subjects all the time’ and it would ‘never speak on the record' about these conversations.

Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested to the United Nations last month that his country may take military action against Iran by next spring to set back its nuclear programme.
