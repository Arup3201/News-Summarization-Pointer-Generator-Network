A woman whose right arm was amputated from the shoulder down when she was three years old after being misdiagnosed with cancer has received a bionic limb.

Doctors later found that Ashley Kurpiel, 32, from Georgia, was in fact suffering from a rare, incurable disease called Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) which causes her soft tissues to turn into solid bone.

After being fitted with her new robotic arm at the Denver Clinic for Extremities At Risk in Colorado last week, she told CBS News: 'I keep looking down and seeing two hands and it's just mind-blowing.'

The prosthesis works through sensors placed on Ms Kurpiel's right shoulder.

These detect minute electrical charges in her muscles and trigger small motors in the battery-powered arm to move.

This means Ms Kurpiel can now multi-task. In front of a film crew she demonstrated how she can now use her cell phone and hold a drink at the same time.

'I put a cookie in there and just go for it,' Ms Kurpiel later said while popping a biscuit into her mouth.

Lucky: Ms Kurpiel, who has already lost an arm to the condition, says she is happy her jaw hasn't locked

Ms Kurpiel is one of an estimated 700 people worldwide with Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP), a disease sometimes known as 'stone man syndrome' because its devastating effects can leave sufferers completely immobilised, like living statues.

'My condition has made me who I am - an optimistic person with an inner strength and determination to succeed,' Ms Kurpiel previously said.

'If I want to do something, then I normally find a way to do it. I don't know how much longer I will have movement in my body, so I want to experience as much as I can now.

'In other cases of FOP people have frozen solid, their jaws locking shut. They can't move and have to talk through their teeth long before they get to my age. So I actually feel extremely lucky.'

The condition arises from a mutation of the body's repair mechanism which causes muscles, tendons and ligaments to convert to bone material when damaged.

Ms Kurpiel,, whose mother Carol emigrated to Georgia from the UK before she was born, was diagnosed with the condition when she was three years old - six months after her right arm was amputated by surgeons who wrongly suspected she had cancer.

'During my childhood my mobility was fine, because I was still young,' she added. 'But I was quite unhappy. I felt very different from the other children at school, and I didn't have many friends. I was quite shy and kept myself to myself. It wasn't much of a life.'

Her symptoms first began to show when she was a teenager, with gradual muscle stiffening accelerating as she grew older.

'I began to feel my body stiffen gradually. I knew I was finally facing the onset of the condition,' she remembers.

'I'd been told what was going to happen, and feeling the first symptoms made me want to experience everything life had to offer - before it was too late.'

She married Shawn Keeney, 31, a man she met online, but the pair divorced in 2005 after three years of marriage.

'I'm still on good terms with Shawn and I look back on our time together with nothing but fondness,' Ms Kurpiel said.

'Walking down the aisle, with full use of my limbs, was one of the happiest days of my life, and no one can take that memory away from me.'

Despite her happy memories, in May 2006, Ms Kurpiel's life took a turn for the worse after she was involved in a serious car crash.

She escaped without any broken bones but her right leg took a heavy impact.

'My doctor warned me that just the slightest bump could trigger the FOP to take hold. After the smash I fully expected my leg to freeze up permanently,' Ms Kurpiel said.

Proud: Ms Kurpiel wants to do as much as she possibly can before being left immobile

'One of my worst fears was that my body would fuse upright, meaning I'd never be able to sit again.

'When my leg locked in a standing position I was sure I was facing a worst-case scenario. Luckily when the swelling went down I was able to bend the leg slightly.

'I spent a lot of time sitting in the hope it would fuse in that position. At least then I could sit in a wheelchair and be wheeled around.'

Her leg locked into a bent position permanently in May 2007, and Ms Kurpiel was fitted with a special platform shoe to help her maintain as much mobility as possible.

Since the setback, Ms Kurpiel has been determined to do more with her life and so far, has learned to surf and completed a five kilometre course in a specially-adapted wheelchair in August last year.

She has also become a full-time ambassador for amputees and families affected by the FOP and in December she is going on a Caribbean cruise with 100 friends who are amputees.Â 

'I've been blessed to meet so many truly amazing people, especially the Dalai Lama - that was a real honour,' said Ashley of the religious leader, whom she met in 2007.

'I feel so humbled that so many people have taken an interest, and hopefully found some inspiration, in my life.'

There's no known cure for FOP, but in 2006, a team at the University of Pennsylvania isolated the gene responsible for the disease. Researchers are now searching for a cure.
