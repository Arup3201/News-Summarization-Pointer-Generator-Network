Australian women lose almost a quarter of their incomes after separating from their husbands, whereas men's incomes remain virtually unchanged, says a new government report.

A report for the Australian Institute of Family Studies found the household income of Australian women dropped by 21 percent in the year following a separation, whereas men's incomes dropped only one percent in the year after divorcing.

The study, which tracked the incomes of 15,000 Australians over ten years, found that while the incomes of separated women recovered somewhat over a longer period, six years after separating, the household income for separated women was still 12 percent lower than the incomes of non-separated women, after the numbers were adjusted for the number of household members.

Co-researcher Professor Matthew Gray from the Australian National University said the figures were the result of a combination of factors, but largely stemmed from the fact that women often took time off work to raise children and bore the brunt of child-rearing costs after separation.

'Women will be less likely to be working, or more likely to be working part-time. Then while there might be child support paid it's not normally that big,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'For men, their household income will go down, because often their partner is working, but they’re in a household of one person and while they will pay child support, that's nothing like the financial contribution they would have made if they were living in a household [with the children].'

The findings come as researchers predict that within a generation the majority of homeless people in Sydney will be single women over the age of 50 who do not have any of the issues that often lead to homelessness, such as mental health problems or addiction, but face poverty and homelessness due to unequal wages, the financial impact of divorce and child-rearing costs.

The government study, released today, also compared the effect of divorce on income of people in the UK, the U.S., Germany, Korea and Switzerland, and revealed that Australian divorced couples fared relatively well compared to their overseas counterparts.

Six years after separation the income of divorced women was significantly lower than non-divorced women.

In the U.S. there was a 37 percent loss of income for women after separation, in Germany the loss was 23 percent and in Britain it was 17 percent.

Though they still lost 12 percent of their incomes, Australian women fared better than women in all other countries studied except Switzerland, where there was no evidence of any real impact of separation on women’s incomes.

The relatively strong financial position Australian women found themselves in was credited by the researchers to increased workforce participation, government income support, child support and high levels of re-partnering.

In the U.S., where women fared the worst after separating, the large financial cost was linked to low levels of government support, low minimum wages and modest rates of re-partnering.

The blow to men’s incomes six years after separating was also measured by the study.

While Australian men saw no change and Swiss men were financially better off after separating, men in Britain, the U.S. and Germany were substantially worse off than non-separated men, earning 18 percent less in Britain, 13 percent less in Germany and 11 percent less in the U.S. than partnered men.
