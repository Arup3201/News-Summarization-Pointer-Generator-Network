Fishing fanatic Jason Ebbett hauled in the biggest yellowfin tuna fish ever recorded in Queensland on his first ever game fishing trip in the state.

The gigantic tuna weighed in at 85kg, breaking the previously held Queensland record by 20kg.

Mr Ebbett, a Worongary tradesman, had only recently joined the Gold Coast Game Fishing Club so he could target larger fish, and is thrilled to have access to fresh tuna for his meals.

He and his crew have eaten over $3000 worth of the fish since their record breaking catch. 

Gold Coast fishing fanatic Jason Ebbett hauled in the biggest yellowfin tuna fish ever recorded in Queensland on his first ever game fishing trip in the state.

Mr Ebbett, a Worongary tradesman had only recently joined the Gold Coast Game Fishing Club so he could target larger fish, and is thrilled to have access to fresh tuna for his meals.

'We are working our way through it pretty quickly,' he told the Gold Coast Bulletin.

'That fish and three others were divided up between about 10 of us.'

Mr Ebbett weighs in at 95kg himself, but said it was a struggle to haul the enormous tuna into the boat, and took over 20 minutes to capture fully. 

'It was pretty hard going pulling it in,' he said.

'It took three guys to get it in the boat.'

The Queensland Game Fishing Association confirmed that the catch made by Mr Ebbett was the largest of the species caught in Queensland's history. 

'I only have a 14-foot (4.2 metre) boat, so this is a way of doing another sort of fishing,' he said.

'I have caught a couple of yellowfin tuna before, but nothing close to this size.'

Another member of Mr Ebbett's crew, Ashleigh Haigh said that while the Gold Coast was not as known for it's fishing hauls in the same way as other parts of Australia were, he hoped that the massive fish would draw attention to the region.

'There are lots more fish like this out there to be caught,' he said.
