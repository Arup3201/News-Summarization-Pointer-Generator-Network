A Utah couple who run a carpet cleaning business were found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning on Saturday night in a tragic accident while working at a house.

Maria Lopez-Landaderde, 38, and Jose Lito-Solorzano, 44, were found unresponsive in a West Jordan home about 6.30pm.

They were discovered by three people who had been planning to move into the residence and were waiting in a truck with their belongings nearby, according to Fox 13.

Maria Lopez-Landaderde, 38, and Jose Lito-Solorzano, 44, were found unresponsive in a West Jordan home on Saturday. Fire officials found their carpet cleaning van parked inside the garage with engine on and door shut

The couple were found by three tenants who were waiting in a truck nearby for the all-clear to move in

Authorities believe the victims were preparing the home for the new tenants when they fell unconscious inside the residence at 6057 Miners Mesa Drive.

Fire department officials said when they arrived, a van appearing to belong to the carpet cleaning company was parked inside the garage.

They said the van was running and the garage door was closed.

'There was an auxiliary motor that runs that they use as they clean the carpet and it appears that carbon monoxide was getting into the home, causing the two adults to become unconscious and suffer from carbon monoxide poisoning,' West Jordan Fire Chief Marc Mcelreath told.

The new tenants, who asked not to be identified, said they had been waiting to get approval to begin moving in.

After they didn't receive any word, they went to the home and found the victims in the first floor.

The couple were transported to Jordan Valley Hospital in critical condition.

They were pronounced dead sometime after being admitted.

Investigators say carbon monoxide levels reached a lethal amount and there was not enough ventilation in the home.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that has no odor or color.

It is found in combustion fumes, such as those made by cars and trucks, lanterns, stoves, gas ranges and heating systems.

CO from these fumes can build up in places that don't have a good flow of fresh air.

People and animals are easily poisoned by breathing them in, with many cases resulting in death.

The most common symptoms of CO poisoning are   - Headache   - Dizziness   - Weakness   - Nausea   - Vomiting   - Chest pain   - Confusion

It is often hard to tell if someone has CO poisoning, because the symptoms may be like those of other illnesses.

People who are sleeping or intoxicated can die from CO poisoning before they have symptoms.

A CO detector can warn you if you have high levels of CO in your home.
