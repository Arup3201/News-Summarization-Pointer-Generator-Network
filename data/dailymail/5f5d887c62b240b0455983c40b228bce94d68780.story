A woman who tracked down her beloved choir teacher 35 years after leaving her class has taken her in after discovering she had dementia.

The extraordinary show of kindness came after Carolyn Denson James, 62, sought out Marty Hayes so she could thank her for her lessons - and for inspiring James into also becoming a teacher.

Hayes had served as the choir director at Kimball High School in Dallas, Texas when James attended the school, and she said the teacher's support had boosted her confidence during her teen years.

'She meant the world to me,' James
told TODAY.com. 'She made everyone feel special, that they brought 
something to the table.'

James moved back to the area from Scottsdale, Arizona in 2004 and tracked down Hayes - but quickly noticed that there was something wrong with her former teacher.

She said that Hayes, now 74, would often call her or her husband when she became disorientated or lost, or would drive her car off the road.

The couple began visiting Hayes more regularly to help her with paperwork and paying bills, and they eventually decided to take her to the doctors.

She was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia, the second most common dementia after Alzheimer's. It causes cognitive abilities to fail and can cause stiff muscles, slowed movement and tremors.

Three years after they had got back in
touch, Hayes, who had never married or had children, moved into her 
former student's home to get the care she needed.

'She
was someone who was always in charge, the one to look to for all the 
ideas, and all of a sudden the table turns,' James said.

Hayes had joined the school in 1966 and left the school just three years later to become the Dallas Independent School Districtâ€™s fine arts coordinator - but in that short time, she left her mark.

'My
message to them was always that they were given a very special 
potential and they should keep learning and laughing with each other and
enjoying it.' she said.

In 
the school yearbook in 1969, the students dedicated a page to Hayes, 
writing: 'Not all teachers care about their students as much as you do' 
and 'Some people are made for happiness; you are one of them.'

Speaking
to the Dallas Morning News, James added: 'I can never thank her enough 
for what she did to give me confidence and let me know that education 
was what I wanted to do.

'She mentored me in the early years. Now I'm helping her in time.'

James is now a counselor after 30 years of teaching.

Hayes, who has started using a wheelchair, now lives at the home with James, her husband - himself a former choir master - and her father.

The family started a 'We Are Her Kids' fund to raise money for Hayes' care.

'They are truly a gift from God,' Hayes said about the couple. 'They just walked into my life and took it over.'
