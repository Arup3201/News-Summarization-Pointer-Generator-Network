A Melbourne man who is believed to have been killed fighting for ISIS in Syria reportedly only became a jihadist as an excuse to 'be a part of the violence' to satisfy his aggressive nature.

It is reported that Mahmoud Abdullatif, known as the 'playboy jihadist', was killed over the weekend.  

Abdullatif's former girlfriend has come forward, opening up about the man she knew - a bully from Brunswick Secondary College who had a penchant for violence.

Playboy jihadi: Mahmoud Abdullatif was known for his love of women and fast cars before he became a militant jihadi

It has been reported that Victorian woman Zehra Duman, pictured, had married Abdullatif

Sahini Sendeera, 21, says her ex-boyfriend was a man of extremes. 

Abdullatif was a rebel and a womaniser who never lived a religious lifestyle, yet was fiercely proud to be a Muslim according to Fairfax Media. 

'I think he liked the extreme culture of Islam and I think he just wanted to be a part of the violence,' Ms Senadeera told SMH. 

'I think for him Islam was just an excuse to behave like that.' 

Ms Sendeera explains that his approach to religion incorporated many double standards, purporting to be religious whilst acting aggressively and chasing women in clubs.

Abdullatif was called 'Mushi' by his friends and was part of a troublesome group who were all allegedly kicked out of school in Year 11.   

Both his ex-girlfriend and a former friend, who did not wish to be named, always assumed Abdullatif's misbehaviour was harmless.

'He did have a reputation for being a wannabe badass but I never expected this, I thought he was just full of it,' the friend told Fairfax.

However, his former girlfriend does concede that he made friends and admirers because he had a 'really interesting personality'. 

The message came from a woman purporting to be his wife on Twitter, who marked his death with an apparent celebratory message on Tuesday. 

'Till we reunite in Jannatul Firdaws (heaven) my dearest husband,' the account said. 'You won the race! Heart of a green bird insha'Allah habibi<3!' 

Just a month ago, Abdullatif announced his marriage to the woman, reportedly Victorian woman Zehra Duman, on Twitter. 

At the time, he also said he hoped for a 'beautiful death.

'I got married today... insha Allah I receive a beautiful death as well. #jihadlife,' he wrote on December 19. 

Abdullatif was pictured just weeks ago accompanying Sydney militant Mohamed Elomar and a friend.

The image was captioned on social media: 'Aussie reunion in the land of khalifah (caliphate).'

Abdullatif's purported killing is the latest in a spate of Australian deaths in the Middle East. 

Mohammad Ali Baryalei, a mid-level Islamic State commander, was reported dead in October. 

Authorities believed Baryalei responsible for the recruitment of as many as half of the Australians fighting for the Islamic State.
