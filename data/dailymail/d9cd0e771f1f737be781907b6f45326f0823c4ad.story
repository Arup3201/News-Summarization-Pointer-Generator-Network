Goldman Sachs has banned its bankers from their offices between Friday nights and Sunday mornings in a bid to tackle 'burn out' and improve 'work-life balance'.

A memo issued to executives at the investment bank, who often work up to 100 hours a week, told them to stay away from work for the 36-hour period.

But many will still have to knuckle down on Sundays which are not covered by the edict, designed to foster a friendlier atmosphere in an industry famed for its ferocious work ethic.

To enjoy their 'Goldman weekend' to the full, junior bankers must leave the office by 9pm on Fridays not to return until 9am the following Sunday, though they 'are still expected to check their blackberries [sic] on a regular basis', it said.

And those seeking to shirk the mandate and slog from the comfort of their own living rooms were told: 'Work 
should not shift from office to home.' 

The memo also states that staff are 'strongly encouraged' to take three weeks holiday a year'.

'If a team needs a professional exception to the Saturday rule (ie a junior banker needs to work on Saturday and/or the entire weekend), please email [a senior manager] by 9am on Friday for approval. Exceptions will not be the norm and should be used sparingly,' it adds.

High pressure: Young bankers often feel obliged to prove their mettle by enduring dangerously long shifts, and working several nights without sleep, sometimes pepped up by caffeinated drinks and drugs

'All analysts and associates are expected, and will be strongly encouraged, to take three weeks of vacation a year. This should include at least one, but preferably two, protected one-week vacations. Vacations will be tracked and reported on a quarterly basis.

'All analysts, including new first 
year analysts, are expected to take time off (preferably one week) 
before the end of the year in an effort to focus on work-life balance.'

The banking industry's tough work expectations were thrust into the spotlight in August after trainee Moritz Erhardt died in the shower this year after working 'crazy hours' at Goldman rival Merrill Lynch.

Goldman Sachs was founded in 1869 by a German Jewish immigrant called Marcus Goldman who pioneered the idea that entrepreneurs could issue short-term bonds to finance the expansion of their businesses.

His first partner was his son-in-law Samuel Sachs and they built up the firm so it could buy a seat at the New York Stock Exchange.

By 1906, the new bank managed the biggest ever flotation by bringing retailer Sears, Roebuck and Company to the market.

The next generation of brains included Sidney Weinberg who took control during the Great Depression in the 1930s and developed the advisory, lending and trading arms of the bank.

When it decided to float on the stock market in 1999, most partners took away tens of millions of pounds and several drifted off into public service.

On Wall Street, Goldmans continued as a profit-making machine, making an astonishing $17.6billion in 2007 and rewarding staff with record bonuses.

The 21-year-old, who was reportedly on the verge of landing a £45,000-a-year job with the bank, collapsed and died in the shower at his student halls flat in Bethnal Green, east London, after allegedly working through the night eight times in a two week period.

Even before the tragedy was formally confirmed, internet forums were rife with stories about investment banking interns feeling obliged to prove their mettle by enduring dangerously long shifts, and working several nights without sleep, sometimes pepped up by caffeinated drinks and drugs.

When he did not show up for work, another intern who lived in the same flat called the building managers, who found Erhardt's body in the shower at about 8.30pm on August 15.

It is believed he may have had an epileptic fit possibly caused by exhaustion.

Talented Mr Erhardt had already completed placements at KPMG Consulting, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank's corporate finance division before working for Merrill Lynch.

Goldman Sachs was hit by a £1.3billion backlash last year after one of its senior executives quit before launching a devastating attack on it's ‘morally bankrupt’ practices.

The global investment bank’s share price fell after Greg Smith said Goldman staff referred to clients as ‘muppets’ and ripped them off for as much money as possible.

Mr Smith, announcing 
his resignation in an open letter in the New York Times, blamed two of 
the bank’s top bosses for the ‘decline in the firm’s moral fibre’.

He
claimed that Goldman’s chief executive Lloyd Blankfein and its 
president Gary Cohn ‘lost hold of the firm’s culture on their watch’.

Shares in the bank fell 3.4 per cent 
in New York trading as the shockwaves hit, although it still left the 
company worth an estimated £36billion.

Mr Smith, 33, an executive director, was
praised for his moral courage after quitting his £3million a year job 
in despair at the company’s dubious ethics.

However, an internal 
investigation by the investment bank claimed that Greg Smith demanded to 
be put on $1million a year, which was double his $500,000 salary at the 
time.

He also felt that he wasn’t being 
promoted quickly enough even though colleagues thought he had an 
‘unrealistic’ view of himself, it said.
