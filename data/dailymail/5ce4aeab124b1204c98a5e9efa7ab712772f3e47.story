A 17-year-old girl who died when the SUV she was driving ran off the road and slammed into several trees was 13 times over the legal limit, tests have shown.

She took the wheel after three teenage boys had driven the car and they are now facing criminal charges, including reckless endangerment.

The town of Glastonbury, Connecticut, has been mourning Elisabeth Jane Modlesky, ever since her accident on July 14.

Tragic: Elisabeth Jane Modlesky, 17, was killed July 14 when she crashed her SUV into an oak tree

Star: Modlesky was one of the leading point scorers on the Glastonbury High School lacrosse team and was looking forward to her senior year, her coach says. She is seen here with her mother

Horrific: Police say Modlesky lost control of her vehicle and slammed into a series of oak trees

The police investigation into what transpired prior to the crash determined that four juvenile males - who have not been named - and Ms Modlesky were driving in a 2008 Honda pilot, which belonged to the parents of one of Jane Modlesky's friends.

Police
said that juvenile No3 was driving the vehicle and dropped off Juvenile No4 at a residence in Glastonbury.

Then juvenile No3 continued on and drove to his house and got out. Juvenile No1 then took control of the vehicle and drove to his house where Juvenile No2 got out with him.

Glastonbury Police Agent James A. 
Kennedy said: ‘It was determined that two of the juveniles were well 
aware that Jane Modlesky was highly intoxicated. However, despite 
knowing this, they allowed her to operate the vehicle.’

He added: 'Jane Modlesky then drove exactly half a mile, before leaving the roadway and striking a tree on Woodhaven Road, which resulted in her death.'

A 17-year-old girl was arrested this weekend having thrown two parities while her parents were out of town, police said

Devastating: Modlesky is seen here with her parents as an infant. She was just 17 when she was killed in July

Proud father: Modlesky, seen here with her father, was 'cheerful and bright' and 'any family would have been happy to have her,' says her lacrosse coach

Police have determined that Modlesky was 13 times over the limit when she crashed

Her blood alcohol was found to be 0.27 per cent – 13 times the legal driving limit for someone under 21 - at the time of the crash.

In August, a 17-year-old girl was arrested by Glastonbury police for throwing booze-fueled parties.

Police
say they handed down the charges in connection with Modlesky's 
late-night crash, but have not said whether she was coming home from a 
party thrown by the teenage suspect.

Police
said they charged the teenage girl - the same age as Modlesky - because
they wanted to 'send a message' to other teens in the town about the 
consequences of drinking, the Hartford Courant reports.

'The
bottom line with this arrest is we are hoping to get a message out 
there that we are taking this seriously,' Police Chief David Caron said.

'It's
a little disappointing when an incident like this happens and we've 
lost a student. But we are going to follow up and we are going to take 
this seriously.'

Six teenagers from the town of 34,000 have died in car crashes this summer.

The
teen girl who was arrested in August has been charged with throwing two
parties at her house while her parents were out of town.

Police say her arrest is connected to Modlesky's crash.

Modlesky
was a star of the Glastonbury High School lacrosse team - one of the 
top scorers - and was looking forward to her senior year.

'She was an extremely cheerful, pleasant kid,' Coach Danny McCarthy told the Courant.

'She
had a great attitude and was a leader and motivator. Smart girl, 
extremely polite. She loved the game and it's just a shame - each time 
something like this happens, you can't help but think of your own 
children.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
