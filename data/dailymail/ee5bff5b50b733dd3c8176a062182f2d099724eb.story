Passed away: Evelyn Dahab died on Wednesday morning when a fire began in her basement apartment in New York City

A New York City writer, bar owner and one-time actress who appeared in long running soap opera Guiding Light died in a fire in her Manhattan basement on Wednesday,  the NYPD confirmed.

Evelyn Dahab, 33, was found in her bed after firefighters arrived to tackle a blaze in her basement apartment in the East Village neighborhood.

Dahab, who had been involved in a lengthy and costly $18,000 legal battle with her landlord, had planned to vacate her home at the end of the year and was pronounced dead at the scene around 3.15am.

'She was bigger than life and too young to die,' said her father, Richard Dahab to DNAinfo.

It took 60 firefighters 30 minutes to bring the blaze under control and neighbors said that they thought everyone had exited the building before they saw flames and smoke coming from the basement apartment.

'The fire department came and broke open the door and smoke just came billowing out. It was a very dark gray. The smell was powerful. It just smelled like burnt charcoal,' said resident Chase Chemero.

Tragedy: Dahab published a novel in 2011 which charted her adventures around the world with a rich boyfriend and also studied at Columbia University for her undergraduate degree

According to Dahab's parents the fire was caused by faulty wiring, but the FDNY or NYPD has not confirmed that.

Originally from Long Island, Dahab attended Columbia's Barnard College and had a novel, Incapitated published in 2011.

The novel, a memoir, recounted her travels across the world with a rich bachelor.

A resident of Manhattan for the past 11 years, Dahab also owned a part share in Brooklyn bar, Lucey's Lounge, in the trendy area of Gowanus.

During her twenties, Dahab also appeared in a few episodes of Guiding Light, which according to the Guinness Book of Records was the world's longest running drama show.

In addition, the multi talented Dahb had also worked sometimes as a fitness model and also spent time working in finance.

'She was beautiful. She was a bright girl. She'd written a book. She went to Barnard,' said her mother, Carolyn Dahab to DNAinfo.

She added that she had last spoken to her daughter on Sunday.

Angry Facebook post: Evelyn Dahab took to Facebook on October 15 after signing an agreement with her landlord to move out by the end of the year

Dahab was due to leave the apartment on December 31 after a long-running dispute with her landlord who owns 31 E. 1st St.

She claimed they were refusing to return her $18,000 deposit. 

In a Facebook post from October, at around 5pm, Dahab wrote, 'After a painful legal dispute, Big Apple Management has refused to refund my $18,000 deposit. Even the property manager looked like she was close to tears as the landlord's lawyer bullied her (let alone bullying me and my attorney) when she protested moneys owed in my favor.'

Going on, Dahab explained the resolution to her dispute, writing, 'Bottomline, the settlement is that I'll pay one more rent installment (why? they already have 3 months security and the last 3 months prepaid, right? -- but the voice of logic falls on the deaf ears of criminals)... And I'll move out before the new year...

Speaking to the MailOnline, an attorney representing 31 E. 1st St refuted Dahab's claims entirely.

Todd Nahins, of Borah, Goldstein, Alphschuler, Nahins and Goidel said that Dahab had signed an agreement to vacate the apartment on October 15, the same day she posted her angry Facebook post.

He said that Dahab did not owe any outstanding rent nor did her landlord owe her anything in return in security deposits or prepaid rent.

Nahins said that Dahab was represented by her attorney when the agreement for her to move out was signed on October 15 and that she was to vacate by December 31.

He said that any confusion from Dahab about money being withheld was just that and she understood that her landlord did not owe her anything.

He also passed on his condolences to her family and said that when he met her in court on October 15 she seemed 'a very bright and nice girl.'
