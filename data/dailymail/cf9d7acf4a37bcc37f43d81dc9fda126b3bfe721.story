British soldiers cleared by UK courts of unlawfully killing Iraqi citizens face the ordeal of war crimes trials in the Hague.

Prosecutors at the International Criminal Court, which usually tries dictators who carry out genocide, have refused to grant the troops immunity from the possibility of fresh charges.

In a letter, the ICC warned it was ‘unable to provide assurances’ that the soldiers would not be hauled before another judge.

Eight servicemen acquitted a decade ago of murdering two Iraqis ‘fall within the scope’ of a fresh inquiry into claims UK forces tortured and abused prisoners, it said.

The ICC announced last May it had launched a ‘preliminary examination’ into claims of mistreatment by UK troops after being handed a dossier by Phil Shiner’s Public Interest Lawyers.

The legal aid-funded firm was criticised last month after the year-long Al Sweady Inquiry demolished its claims that soldiers murdered, tortured and mutilated Iraqi detainees in May 2004.

The latest twist provoked outrage that soldiers were being hounded by international authorities. 

The ICC’s letter was sent to Sir George Newman, chairman of an ongoing inquiry in London into the deaths of Naheem Abdullah, who died of injuries sustained at a road block in Maysan Province in May 2003, and Hassan Said, shot dead in August 2003.

Seven paratroopers were cleared of murdering Mr Abdullah in 2005. In a separate case, one soldier was acquitted of murdering Mr Said after the court ruled he acted in self-defence.

The new development raises the prospect of the troops facing a second trial in the Hague. Colonel Richard Kemp, who commanded British forces in Afghanistan, said the uncertainty was ‘despicable’.

He said: ‘It is an outrage that soldiers who we sent to fight for our country should face even the possibility of trial by the ICC.

‘The British government ordered them to fight in Iraq. British courts have tried and cleared them of any alleged offence.

‘These men and their families have already suffered more than enough stress.

‘For the government to allow brave men who have volunteered to put their lives on the line to be hounded in this way is a national disgrace and a betrayal.’

Colonel Tim Collins, acclaimed for his rousing eve-of-battle speech in the Iraq War, said: ‘This is a failure by the UK to simply put its best efforts into supporting its soldiers and represents a very poor show.

‘Often these right-on courts are quick to point fingers from very vulnerable glass houses.’

The ICC’s examination into claims of abuse by UK troops is the first time it has investigated Britain for alleged war crimes.

The Government has said the UK would cooperate fully in any ICC investigation but ‘completely rejected’ the claim that UK forces were responsible for systematic abuse.
