A policeman has been caught sipping a drink as he drives his patrol car through London - days after a young driver was given a 'ridiculous' £100 fine for a very similar transgression.

The officer was pictured driving through London today holding a takeaway soft drink at the wheel of his Metropolitan Police car.

A passer-by took the photograph this afternoon on Fitzroy Street in London as the car was moving slowly through traffic.

It comes less than a week after 22-year-old Sophie Vaughan found herself confronted with four officers and a police van after taking a single slurp of her raspberry Slush Puppie.

She was fined £100 and given three points on her licence after she was spotted drinking while stationary in South London traffic.

Miss Vaughan, from Wallington, South London, said: ‘It’s so petty and ridiculous. It was only a tiny sip. I wasn’t even moving.

‘I’m outraged. And talk about overkill – to have four police officers dealing with such a petty thing is a joke.’

However, after being confronted with their own officer's conduct, the Metropolitan Police have said that Miss Vaughan was actually given the penalty for after driving without her seatbelt while using both hands to eat the Slush Puppie.

A spokesman said: 'A female driver was seen driving without a seatbelt and without holding on to the steering wheel.

'She was holding a 'Slush Puppie' in one hand and a straw in the other, using the straw to spoon the ice into her mouth.

'She drove away but subsequently stopped the car in Pound Street and was spoken to by officers before being issued with a fixed penalty notice.'

Driving away: The vehicle can be seen moving further down the street through traffic

And although she was met by the full force of the law for her breach, the pictured officer appears to have taken a different view of the law.

Sat Dhoot, 31, an IT engineer who works nearby, saw the officer after reading about Miss Vaughan's fine.

He told MailOnline: 'Only a few moments ago I read an article about a driver who was fined £100 by police for taking a single slurp of slush at the wheel of her car.

'To my amazement, I saw this only moments later. It's not OK for us - but they can.'

The
 law does not specify whether eating or drinking while driving is 
illegal, and whether drivers have committed by doing so depends on how 
it affected their driving.

According
 to advice from the RAC, drinking a soft drink while on the road is only
 an offence 'if you present a significant danger' and if the police 
think 'you are not in proper control of the vehicle'.

A
 study from Leeds University has shown that drivers consuming drinks at 
the wheel went 22 per cent more slowly than average, but were also 18 
per cent more likely to show erratic lane control.

Guidelines
 published by the CPS do not mention food or drink in relation to 
driving without due care and attention - but they mention that any act 
which causes a driver to be 'avoidably distracted' could constitute an 
offence.

This is in 
contrast to more specific laws which exist around other potential 
distractions such as mobile phones - the use of which attracts an 
instant penalty.
