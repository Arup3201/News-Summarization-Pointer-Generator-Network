It says a lot about the reputation of Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston among supporters that Roy Chubby Brown is no longer regarded as the most tasteless comedian in the entertainment capital of the north.

Somehow one of English football’s great traditional clubs has turned into a laughing stock under Oyston’s stewardship.

It has left thousands of fans desperately worried about the future of their famous old club who supplied two of England’s 1966 World Cup-winning squad, Alan Ball and Jimmy Armfield.

Laughing stock: Blackpool have turned into something of a mess under chairman Karl Oyston

Brave face: Manager Jose Riga has been in dispute with Oyston over the club's transfer policy

On Friday, beleaguered manager Jose Riga worked with just eight senior professionals at the club’s dilapidated training ground near Blackpool Airport.

The numbers were swelled by trialists begging for contracts, and youth team players. Those who chose to shower afterwards found only two temperatures available, freezing cold or scorching hot.

With trial goalkeeper Ben Alnwick suddenly jumping ship, last season’s youth-team goalie Connor Hunt was needed between the sticks so the few outfield players present had at least the semblance of an ordinary training session.

With just a fortnight to go before the kick off of the Championship season, Blackpool have played just one pre-season friendly, a meaningless kickabout against non-league Penrith in which Riga deliberately left out some of his contracted players.

They were originally meant to be at a training camp in Majorca yesterday but that was cancelled a long time ago due to lack of numbers.

Despite a total breakdown between Oyston and Riga, the Belgian coach and four members of his backroom staff have not walked and turned up to work every day, cheerful and enthusiastic. Oyston can’t or won’t sack Riga without first finding someone else prepared to work with him.

The stand-off has left Blackpool odds-on favourites for relegation and even though the club have offered two-year season ticket sales for the price of one year, numbers are well down on the 11,000 last season.

Fans primarily blame chairman Oyston, whose father Owen – the club’s owner - was paid £11million when Blackpool were relegated from the Premier League in 2010/11.

They are convinced that when the final parachute payment of about £9million is paid in early August, it will somehow end up in the pockets of the Oyston family rather than invested in new players.

The few that have sympathy for Oyston are suspicious that Riga’s transfer targets are unrealistic and will see money paid to agents.

His only ‘buy’ so far, Estonian international Sergei Zenjov, is a lightweight winger who cannot be guaranteed to be successful in the Championship.

Stuck in the middle of the dispute between chairman and manager are the fans.

An inaugural meeting of the Blackpool Supporters’ Club at a working man’s club near Bloomfield Road a fortnight ago attracted 500 people.

Chairman Tim Fielding said: ‘Our job is to hold the owners to account. We would either ask the Oystons to put the football first or let someone else take over. I think it is fair to say we are not happy with them.’

Fielding hasn’t bought a season-ticket for the first time in 25 years. He will go to home games on a match-by-match basis and attend all the away games.

‘The only people at Blackpool who have benefited since we were in the Premier League are Karl Oyston and his family,’ he says.

‘He promoted his new manager as the Riga revolution when he appointed him a few week ago and almost from day one we are in a situation where he isn’t backing him. The Mexican stand-off has been going for seven weeks – it is beyond bizarre.’

Short on numbers: Blackpool have had to field a large number of trialists in recent friendlies

Youngsters: They have just eight first-team players currently on their books

Meanwhile, the triallists continue to turn up and pray they will get a contract. They include midfielders Jacob Mellis and Tomasz Cwyka who both played for relegated Barnsley last season.

In an ultimate insult, former Blackpool favourite Steven Dobbie is set to turn down an offer from the club to join League One neighbours Fleetwood instead.

At the stadium, they are working on the pretence of business as usual. Oyston has built all the trimmings onto the stadium; a hotel, spa, conference rooms that can be hired for meetings and functions, all against a tangerine backdrop.

But the Blackpool fans now refer to their home ground as Doomfield Road, rather than Bloomfield.

They would be happy to allow Latvian Valerie Belokon take over. He owns 20 per cent of the club but has failed to persuade the Oystons to give him any more.
