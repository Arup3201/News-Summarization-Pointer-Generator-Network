Samsung has shown off a bendable battery that can wrap around a person's wrist.

The company says it is the 'world's first truly flexible battery' and could be used in a variety of wearable devices.

It comes after the company had announced a phone with a curved edge and a bendable battery for the Gear Fit earlier this year. 

South Korean tech giant Samsung has unveiled a flexible battery (shown). It can bend back upon itself and can even fit around your wrist or a cup. The battery is expected to feature heavily in upcoming wearable technology from the company. No further details were announced other than a release in 'years'

The product was shown off at the InterBattery 2014 convention in South Korea by Samsung SDI, the energy and battery division of the company.

The battery can either be laid flat or bent into a U shape, and is shown being bent back on itself.

Flexible phones and other devices are expected to be the future for several technologies.

The unique look is seen at eventually being a key selling point for mobile and tablets, but it doesn't feature heavily in many devices yet.

Samsung's Galaxy Edge, for example, is one of the first phones to have a bendy part to the device - in this case a 'rolled' side where notifications and alerts can appear. 

'An edge-based display will give Samsung's smartphone clear differentiation in a crowded market,' said Ian Fogg, an analyst covering the mobile industry at IHS in London.

'But for Samsung to maximise the potential of an edge display it needs third party apps to support the display with additional Samsung-specific functions.' 

It is currently only in development and no time frame has been put on when it might be used in actual phones other than a loose term of 'years', reports Digital Trends.

It can apparently even be rolled up, as well as bent, and is intended to ultimately used in Samsung's wearable technologies. 

'As we secured winding manufacturing technology - a key process to cut production costs - and related patents, we will be able to become a leader in the wearable era,' said spokesman Seo Hae-su according to the Korea Times.

No further details were released about the battery and when reached for comment by MailOnline Samsung was yet to respond. 

The announcement comes a few months after other bendy devices were unveiled by Samsung.

In April the company revealed the 210 mAh curved battery now found in the Samsung Gear Fit.

Samsung says smart wristbands are a lucrative part of the emerging wearable technology industry, with them expected to take up to 25 per cent of the market.

Last month, meanwhile, Samsung announced the Galaxy Note Edge - a phone with a screen that curves around the phone on one side.

This is intended to be used as a 'ticker' for notifications, and also as a quick access point to apps, alerts and device functions.

The move also comes as Samsung rival LG discussed its own plans to make flexible batteries.

Last year, the firm suggested it may release a battery so bendy it could be tied in a knot.

Samsung also revealed another battery at the show, an unusual pill-sized one.

Measuring 0.14 inches (3.6mm) across and 0.79 inches (20mm) long, the tiny pill battery has a capacity of just 10mAh, although again no further details were revealed. 

Samsung's Gear Fit (stock image shown) already has a curved battery, but the new flexible batteries may allow future wearable technology to be less rigid and more flexible
