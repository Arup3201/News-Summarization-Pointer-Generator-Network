Host commentator

That's all for tonight, thanks for joining.

Who says the Europa League is boring? What a game. Celtic pushed relentlessly in the second half and thoroughly deserve their draw.

Two substitutes combine with Henderson heading the ball onto Guidetti in the box, who controls it on his chest before firing into the roof of the net.

A disappointing result in the end for Spurs who should have been out of sight after the first half.

 

There will be three added minutes in London and four in Glasgow.

Having been so dominant in the first half, get a distinct impression that Tottenham will settle for the draw here. No great ambition left. 

Fiorentina have been poor on the whole tonight but one man out there has rolled back the years tonight - Joaquin.

This is the best I've seen him play in years and has been a constant threat on the counter attack.

Gomez walks slowly off the pitch to be replaced by Ilicic.

The unimpressive Paulinho is replaced by Mason.

Ambrose comes on for Matthews, who appears to be injured.

Griffiths' miss when through on goal. It's hard to see the hosts getting a better chance to equalise.

Unless he's exhausted it's hard to see the logic in bringing off Townsend. By wide consensus he's been Spurs's best player.

Mancini makes a change as Kuzmanovic is replaced by Dodo.

Valero is replaced by Badelj as Fiorentina look to secure the result.

Scorer of Celtic's first goal Armstrong is replaced by Henderson while Guidetti comes on for Grifiths.

Birthday boy Icardi is replaced by Kovacic.

Club-record signing Lamela replaces Townsend - the English winger started really well but has drifted out of the game slightly.

The view from the stands at Celtic Park.

The German has had little-to-no service all game but he counters well, finding space in the box before lifting his shot just over the bar.

His best chance of the match so far (not that that's saying much...)

And Griffiths really should have scored. The former Wolves striker misses a glorious chance when through on goal. Good save by Carrizo, though.

Chadli is replaced by Kane.

Fiorentina captain Pasqual is replaced by former Bolton man Alonso.

Tottenham's leading scorer is getting ready to come on...

Had doubts over whether Tottenham could maintain their early pace and that is proving the case. They have slowed up dramatically in the past 10 minutes.

Mackay-Steven with a decent chance for Celtic. The former Dundee man gets away from Inter's defence but his run pushes him wide and his shot is saved well by Carrizo.

Mancini and Deila watching their teams during the second half 

Gordon's got a long way to go to make up for his howler but he's trying.

Shaqiri dances into the box and bends one towards the top corner but Celtic's keeper palms it away at full stretch.

The longer this game continues with the scores level the more Mauricio Poichettino will have to think about bringing Kane off the bench - a 1-1 draw would not be a satisfactory result for Spurs, especially considering their domination in this game.

Both teams back out and play is underway in Glasgow. 

...and we're back under way at White Hart Lane.

At half-time we are listening to Ledley and the Kings, who have produced Tottenham's official Capital One Cup final song. It is a re-working of Chas & Dave's Hot Shot Tottenham. Of course.

Half time at Celtic Park and Inter lead 3-2.

Fans, and Gordon, may feel it's a harsh scoreline but every mistake is punished at this level and Celtic know that.

Half time in north London but Chadli really should have restored their lead before the break. Soldado's header is saved and the ball falls for the Belgian to tap into an empty net... but he somehow conspires to hit the bar.

Calamitous football from Gordon!  A long ball is played into the Celtic box but the goalkeeper fumbles what should be a routine catch and Palacio pounces to restore Inter's lead.

Even when he scores, it's never quite straightforward for Soldado. Daft free-kick to concede.

The free-kick is whipped in after Soldado's foul. Lloris palms it away but Basanta is on hand to bury the rebound from close range.

Soldado is beaten by compatriot Jopaquin but as the winger heads towards the box the Tottenham striker brings him down.

Harry Kane on the bench but getting plenty of love from the crowd. 'Harry, give us a wave' followed by said wave has got the biggest since the goal. 

Other chants have included: 'Chelsea racists, we are coming for you.'

At 2-0 down Celtic looked in danger of being humiliated at Parkhead but in just over 60 seconds they have come roaring back into this tie.

Salah looking very ordinary here. 

Armstrong involved again, a speculative cross comes into the box Celtic's previous goalscorer pressures Campagnaro, who puts it into his own net from five yards out.

Armstrong grabs a vital goal after a nice move for Celtic and Ronny Deila's side are back in this.

Argentine forward Palacio doubling Inter's lead in the first half.

Soldado gives Tottenham the lead with a superbly-taken volley.

Sahqiri, on loan from Bayern Munich, celebrates gibing Inter the lead in the fourth minute.

Salah misses a glorious chance to equalise. The ball bobbles through to him as he makes his way into the box but takes an age to shoot and is closed down well.

Oh dear. Palacio makes it 2-0 to the visitors. Deila's side struggled to clear the ball and the Argentine strikes from close range with his shot slipping under Gordon.

Fiorentina are firmly on the back foot against Tottenham, they look rattled by that early goal and can't string two passes together.

Inter, on the other hand, look as confident as they have all season. Celtic need to wake up.

Rodriguez with the first booking of the night in north London.

That didn't take long. Tottenham have been dominant. Chadli wasted a great chance moments earlier but what a lovely finish from Soldado for 1-0. Gets maligned quite fairly for his finishing but that was impressive.

Roberto Soldado grabs his fifth goal of the season and what a goal it is. 

Spurs swing in a corner and the former Valencia man drifts away from his marker and volleys home.

Inter lead! Shaqiri takes a pass over his shoulder and volleys beautifully. It's saved initially bit the loan player is quick to react and tucks away the rebound.

Mackay-Steven wastes no time in proving he's up for the occasion. Celtic press high up and the January signing takes a shot from just outside the box. The keeper saves low just to his left.

Referees in London and Glasgow blow their whistles to start the games!

Celtic legend Bertie Auld was on the pitch before kick-off giving them an emotional speech - I think it's fair to say the passion is still there for him...

Not long to go until kick-off now, the players have finished their warm up and are back in their dressing rooms.

Richards impressed in his last outing for Fiorentina - a 3-1 win over Sassuolo - but again fails to make the starting lineup.

The full back is now almost certain to return to the Premier League in the summer, although former City boss Mancini has expressed an interest in bringing him to Inter.

Despite a hero's welcome at Inter, it hasn't been easy for Mancini in Italy this season. His side are currently 10th in Serie A and have lost three of their last five matches.

One positive note for them, though, is that they won their previous two matches, scoring seven goals and conceding just one in the process. 

After just one goal in his first 16 games for the Viola this season, Mario Gomez has now netted five in his last four appearances.

He's still a long way off his Bayern Munich form, but the German forward will be a huge test for Fazio and Vertonghen.

The Serie A side may be without Juan Cuadrado but Mohamed Salah, on loan from Chelsea, does get the nod. 

XI: Tatarusanu, Rodriguez, Savic, Pizarro, Mati Fernandez, Joaquin, Basanta, B. Valero, Pasqual, Gomez, Salah.

Subs: Alonso, Aquilani, Babacar, Badelj, Ilicic, Neto (GK), Richards.

After a difficult start to life at Celtic, manager Ronny Deila is finding his stride. Tonight, though, is surely his largest test - and it will be played out in front of his largest crowd. 

The full 60,000 capacity is expected to be filled for the match against Roberto Mancini's side.

Lukas Podolski left Arsenal in search of game time but after failing to score a single goal for Inter he doesn't make the squad for the match tonight at Celtic Park.

XI: Carrizo; Campagnaro, Ranocchia, Juan Jesus, Santon; Medel, Guarin, Kuzmanovic; Shaqiri; Palacio, Icardi.

Subs: Handanovic, Kovacic, Vidic, Obi, Dodo, Puscas, Hernanes.

There's no place for on-loan Manchester City striker John Guidetti in Ronny Deila's lineup, Leigh Griffiths is preferred again.

XI: Gordon; Matthews, Denayer, van Dijk, Izaguirre; Brown, Bitton; Mackay-Steven, Johansen, Armstrong; Griffiths. 

Subs: Subs: Zaluska, Ambrose, Henderson, McGregor, Wakaso, Scepovic, Guidetti.

And the big news is that star striker Harry Kane (23 goals this season) is rested, leaving Roberto Soldado (four goals this season) to lead the line.

XI: Lloris (c), Walker, Fazio, Vertonghen, Davies; Bentaleb, Paulinho; Chadli, Eriksen, Townsend; Soldado.

Subs: Vorm, Dier, Rose, Dembele, Lamela, Mason, Kane.

It's a Europa League double-header tonight with Tottenham hosting Fiorentina and Inter Milan travelling to face Celtic.

Both matches kick off at 20.05pm.
