David Cameron may have popped up on the X Factor final at the weekend, but it appears the Prime Minister is less au fait with British popular culture than he might have us believe.

He told reporters he once voted for Will Young to win The X Factor because his daughter asked him to - despite the fact Young was a contestant on a different TV talent show, and long before Mr Cameron's elder daughter was even born.

The singer was crowned the winner of Pop Idol back in 2002, two years before Nancy Cameron was born in 2004.

Muddled: The Prime Minister, seen alongside X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger and eventual winner James Arthur, admitted he was not a regular viewer of reality TV shows

Mr Cameron appeared on the X Factor in footage showing finalists switching on the Christmas tree lights outside Number 10.

But the PM admitted he was not a regular 
reality television viewer when journalists asked him whether he would 
like to see London Mayor Boris Johnson appear on the ITV show I'm A 
Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, according to a report in the Daily Telegraph.

Rebel Tory MP Nadine Dorries caused controversy by appearing as a contestant on the show, which sees participants set up camp in the Australian jungle, last month.

Mr Cameron said that he hadn't watched Ms Dorries in the jungle or voted, but he added: 'I think I did vote for Will Young once in The X Factor, because my daughter made me.'

Mid-Bedfordshire MP Dorries was the first contestant to be voted out of the jungle on this year's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!

Her critics had claimed it was inappropriate for an MP to appear on the show while Parliament was in session.
