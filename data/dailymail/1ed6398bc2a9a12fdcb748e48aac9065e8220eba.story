Jewish Labour MP Luciana Berger was on thge receiving end of an offensive tweet from a right-wing loner

A 21-year-old Nazi sympathiser has been jailed for sending a 'grossly offensive' anti-Semitic tweet to Liverpool Labour MP Luciana Berger.

Garron Helm send a tweet showing a Holocaust-era yellow star superimposed on the MP's forehead with the hashtag 'Hitler was right'.

When police searched Helm's home they found Nazi memorabilia including a flag bearing the SS symbol and material from British extreme right-wing group National Action.

Helm referred to himself online as The Noble Wolf and used a Twitter account called Aethelwulf, which translates from Old English as Noble Wolf.

But in reality Helm was an immature loner who found friends online in extremist groups.

He pleaded guilty to sending an offensive, indecent or obscene message and was sentenced to four weeks in jail – though he is expected to serve half of this.

Liverpool Magistrates Court heard that Helm sent the tweet in a state of 'anger and political frustration' in the early hours of August 7. The message showed Miss Berger with the Star of David on her head.

The tweet called the MP a 'communist Jewess' and read: 'You can always trust a Jew to show their true colours eventually.'

Miss Berger, MP for Liverpool Wavertree, was described in court as being 'deeply shocked by the entire incident and the link to National Action, which she knows to be an extremist group'.

District Judge Andrew Shaw described Helm's actions as calculated and 'extremely abusive and upsetting'.

He added that the Nazi paraphernalia found in his house showed his true motivation for sending the tweet.

Mark Ellis, defending, described Helm, of Merseyside, as a loner with a troubled past.

The court heard that Helm was one of 11 children but the family had broken apart after his father died in a work accident and his mother had a mental breakdown, leaving him with no one to turn to except extremist 'friends' online.

Helm, who was expelled from college in Southport earlier this year, accepted the message was fundamentally wrong. He also sent a handwritten letter of apology to the MP.

As well as the jail sentence, Helm was ordered to pay an £80 victim surcharge to Miss Berger after the judge upgraded the offence to one considered racially motivated.
