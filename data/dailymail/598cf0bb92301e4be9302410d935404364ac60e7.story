Lasse Schone's equaliser denied Zlatan Ibrahimovic victory on his old stomping ground as Ajax held Paris St Germain to a 1-1 Champions League draw. 

Denmark winger Schone levelled the match with Ajax's first shot on target, just when PSG were eyeing victory in their opening Group F encounter.

Edinson Cavani blasted his 28th goal in 50 PSG appearances to hand the Frenchmen the lead, with Sweden striker Ibrahimovic looking likely to seal victory at his former club.

The 32-year-old former Ajax and Milan hitman mustered five of PSG's 10 shots on target, but his frustrations grew each time he was unable to find the net.

Ajax found themselves in the fraught uphill struggle they had anticipated against the cash-rich French side, but were able to deny Ibrahimovic's men and salvage a creditable point.

The Dutch hosts slipped behind after just 14 minutes when Cavani drove a low shot home following Ibrahimovic's blocked effort.

Laurent Blanc's visiting side have been tipped to feature among the contenders for this term's title given their spending power and all-star line-up.

The potent Parisians were unable to find the right blend to see off Ajax however, and will view this draw as an early setback given their lofty tournament ambitions.

Schone's equaliser stunned the visitors, the 28-year-old wrong-footing PSG keeper Salvatore Sirigu from a 20-yard free-kick.

He almost stole the contest with an even more spectacular set-piece - but second time around Sirigu was able to tip the ball onto the woodwork.
