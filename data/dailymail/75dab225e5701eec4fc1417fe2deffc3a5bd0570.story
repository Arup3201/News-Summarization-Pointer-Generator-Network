A couple has been arrested after their six-week-old daughter was found unresponsive in their home with apparent signs of long-term neglect, police have said.

Kadence Cannon was covered in dirt and fecal matter with untreated diaper rash and lice when she was found not breathing in Enid, Oklahoma on Wednesday, the police captain told KTOK.

When police interviewed her parents, 45-year-old Mark Cannon and 26-year-old Jennifer Cannon, they told police they had been up all night drinking on Tuesday and got into an argument.

They both left the home separately, with Mr Cannon taking Kadence and their one-year-old son with him, according to a police release.

Arrest: Mark Cannon, 45, and his wife Jennifer Cannon, 26, have been arrested on child neglect charges after their six-week-old daughter was allegedly found filthy and unresponsive in their home this week

When he returned home, he fed his daughter, put her to sleep in bed at sunrise on Wednesday but when he checked her later, he found her cold and not breathing, police said.

Authorities believe six-and-a-half hours had passed between him putting her down and checking on her.

The child's aunt, who would not give her name, made a frantic 911 call on Wednesday.

'I need an ambulance. My little niece is not breathing,' the aunt said in the call, KOCO reported.

The aunt tried CPR to save her as dispatchers advised her on the phone, but little Kadence was pronounced dead at Bass Hospital on Wednesday afternoon.

'Neglected': The little girl was allegedly found with fecal matter on her body and with untreated diaper rash

When investigators arrived at the home, they said they 
determined that both Mark Cannon and Jennifer Cannon still appeared to be under the influence of alcohol.

They were taken to the Garfield County Detention Center on complaints of child neglect.

'There
 was evidence that the neglect had taken course over a period of time,' 
said Lt. Eric Holtzclaw of the Enid Police Department.

The baby's aunt said that Jennifer Cannon had just taken the girl to the doctor for treatment.

'I
 don't know why they would be charging her for neglect because she 
didn't do anything wrong,' she said. 'As far as I’m concerned, 
neither one of them did.'

She added of Kadence: 'She was a happy baby. She's bright-eyed and bushytailed.'

Tributes also poured in for the 'precious' little girl on Facebook beneath a photograph of her.

Her body has been sent to the State
 Medical Examiner’s Office in Oklahoma City for an autopsy.

The one-year-old boy was taken into protective custody by the 
Department of Human Services, officers said.

The investigation is
 still pending and more charges could be filed pending the autopsy 
report.
