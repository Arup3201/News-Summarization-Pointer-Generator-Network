A plane landing at the Dallas/Forth Worth International airport  got stuck in the grass after sliding off a taxiway Monday night.

The American Airlines plane was attempting to turn a corner at a slow speed when the front nose gear slid on the ice, according to a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman. 

The MD-80 plane was unable to continue taxiing to the terminal and the passengers were deplaned through the emergency exit and taken by bus before the aircraft was towed.

 The plane's front nose gear slid on the ice, causing the plane to veer off course. It was unable to continue taxiing to the terminal and the passengers were deplaned through the emergency exit

Flight 296 from San Antonio was carrying 63 passengers and five crew members. No one was hurt, according to NBCDFW.

One passenger said the plane immediately slid to the left as soon as it hit the ground.

Danelle Canales said the pilot then addressed the situation over the intercom, telling the passengers they had 'no control over the brakes' when the plane landed.

The pilot added that the brakes had been fine when they were tested.

Canales said she at first didn't realize the plane had slid.

Another passenger said they 'came down smooth', USA Today reported.

'There wasn't a jolt. We kind of just glided off the runway to the left a little bit.'

'We still had at least one wheel on the ground.'

According to NBCDFW, the cause of the plane's slip has not yet been confirmed, but much of the area was covered in ice after receiving up to an inch of sleet overnight.

Airport crew members are currently working to keep the runways and taxiways clear of ice.

Taxiways are paths connecting runways to ramps and terminals. They are often used to allow planes to vacate runways more quickly.

More than 1,000 flights to be cancelled at DFW on Monday due to ice weather, and 100 have already been pre-cancelled for Tuesday, according to CBS DFW.
