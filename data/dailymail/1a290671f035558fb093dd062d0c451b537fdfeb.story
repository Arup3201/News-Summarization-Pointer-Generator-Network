Tim Cahill and Bradley Wright-Phillips took a break from the MLS campaign to have a round of FootGolf on Tuesday.

Former Everton star Cahill, now of New York Red Bulls, and team-mate Bradley Wright-Phillips, son of ex Arsenal star Ian, were joined by US international Matt Besler at Glendoveer Golf Course to show the rest of the world how it's done.

The 2014 MLS All-Stars looked naturals at the game, which is a cross between football and golf.

Cahill and Wright-Phillips' success on the footballing front has not been so great recently, however.

Besler's Sporting Kansas City lead the way in the Eastern conference, while Wright-Phillips, Cahill and Thierry Henry are 11 points off the pace down in fourth spot. 

Former Tottenham and Liverpool striker Robbie Keane, ex-Spurs forward Jermain Defoe, former West Brom defender Liam Ridgewell and ex-Newcastle striker Obafemi Martins were also selected for the MLS All-Star side.
