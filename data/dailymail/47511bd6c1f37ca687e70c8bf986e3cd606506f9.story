Declared dead: The California court allowed Jahi McMath's parents to remove her from hospital and keep her alive elsewhere only after a coroner issued a death certificate

The body of 13-year-old Jahi McMath left brain dead after a tonsil operation was released to her mother last night.

Jahi left Oakland's Children’s Hospital & Research Center about 7.50pm in a critical care ambulance to the home of her mom, Latasha Winkfield.

The teenager's uncle said the family was 'ecstatic'.

'I was with her when she left the hospital and the family is very grateful for this day,' Omari Sealey said.

'We are pleased she is away from Children's Hospital which has been trying to pull the plug on my niece since December 12th.

'We fought and we fought to make sure she had a chance at recovery.

'She will now be treated like the precious little girl that she is.'

Jahi suffered complications following
 a routine operation to remove her tonsils at the Oakland hospital on December 9.

Her heart stopped, causing brain damage which the 
hospital said left her brain dead with no chance
 of survival if a respirator was turned off.

Three
 doctors and the court agreed she was brain dead and the hospital 
applied to turn off her life support machine, with the Alameda County 
Coroner issuing a death certificate.

However Jahi's family won an injunction preventing the hospital switching off life support 
and agreed to a ‘protocol’ with the hospital in which the teenager could 
be transferred while on a ventilator.

The hospital last night said it wished the family 'closure' over the traumatic affair.

'Our hearts go out to the family as they
 grieve for this sad situation and we wish them closure and peace,' they said in a statement.

Devastated: Jahi's parents arrive at court Friday. They are fighting to keep their 13-year-old daughter alive after she was declared brain dead following complications in routine tonsil surgery

Willing and able: New Beginnings Community Center founder Allyson Scerri said the outpatient rehabilitation facility has been named as a potential care center for Jahi

The
 news comes after the girl's family yesterday said they had ‘everything
 in place’ to move Jahi from the hospital to a long term care facility.

Christopher Dolan, the lawyer representing Jahi's family, said his clients had medical staff, transport and a 
new home for the teenager and were just about to ‘get it all in motion’.

While it is not clear where the girl 
will be moved to, a New York facility run by a woman whose father suffered 
severe brain trauma in 2007 has offered its services.

New Beginnings Community Center founder Allyson Scerri said the outpatient rehabilitation facility has been named as a potential care center for Jahi.

'We
 are aware of Jahi McMath's dire situation, and we are willing to open 
our outpatient facility to provide 24-hour care as an inpatient, 
long-term facility for Jahi with the required and appropriate medical 
staff that she depends upon,' Scerri said in a letter included in court 
documents last week, according to Koco.com.

According to the facility's website, Scerri founded the facility after her father, Al Barone, sustained a traumatic brain injury in a motorcycle accident in 2007.

Seeing
 her father, a man of great strength and independence, inadequately 
cared for was an unacceptable frustration for Scerri, the website says.

The businesswoman told CNN she believes McMath could get better, with appropriate care.

'Her
 brain needs time to heal. It's a new injury,' Scerri said. 'We believe 
in life after injury, all of us here at New Beginnings have first-hand 
experience because we have a loved one that was in the same situation as
 Jahi.'

War of words: Children's Hospital Oakland spokesman Sam Singer (right) has accused Christopher Dolan, the lawyer representing Jahi's family (left), of misleading people about Jahi's likely recovery

Oakland's Children's Hospital yesterday insisted the girl could not be be rehabilitated.

Spokesman Sam Singer yesterday criticized the family's decision to give Jahi 'nutrients' to maintain her brain at optimum efficiency.

'This is a deceased young woman,' Children's Hospital Oakland spokesman Sam Singer told ABC 7.

'No amount of food, medicine, medical machinery, time or hope is going to bring back her back.

'So
 it's really wrong and unethical for Mr. Dolan (the family lawyer) to mislead the family and
 the public that there's any amount of hope or any food that could 
possibly bring back this deceased young woman.'

Jahi's family, led by her mother Nailah and uncle Omari Sealey, 
have refused to accept the prognosis and argued there was still a chance
 she could recover.

‘We are in motion,’ Mr Dolan told KPIX 5 yesterday.

‘We
 have what we need right now. I have everything in place I just need to 
get it moving. I have a medical staff, I have the facilities, we have 
the transport, we just need to get it all in motion.’

He said that ‘come hell or high water’ Jahi would be moved before the deadline.

Jahi's family has raised more than $47,000 on GoFundMe.com to move her. According to the site, more than 1,300 people have donated money in nine days.

Hope: Jahi's family are certain that she will one day recover despite the hospital's insistence there is no chance of that happening
