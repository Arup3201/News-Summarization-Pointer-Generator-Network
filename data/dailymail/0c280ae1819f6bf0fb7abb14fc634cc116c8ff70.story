Two women have become friends for life after both being struck by an unthinkable tragedy – their teenage daughters each committed suicide after being bullied.

Canadians Leah Parsons and Carol Todd struck up a friendship from across the country after their daughters Rehtaeh and Amanda were found dead last year. Each woman knew intimately the pain the other felt, they helped each other in ways no one else could.

Todd, of Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, and Parsons, of Peggy’s Cove, Halifax, texted, emailed and spoke on the phone for nearly a year before finally meeting in an emotional visit detailed by the Globe and Mail.

‘We know what that pain feels like,’ Ms. Parsons says. ‘We were able to connect and share things that we don’t necessarily share in public, just different things about our daughters.’

‘It’s weird how tragedy can bring you together,’ Todd added. ‘You can open up a conversation that you can’t open up with anyone else.

‘You can’t talk about the whys and the what-ifs and … what you saw and how you feel with just any other person,’ she continued. ‘Even my closest friends, who haven’t gone through it, can’t talk about it.’

Parsons marked the one year anniversary of her daughter’s sobering April 7 death this week, and Todd greeted her with a text message.

‘How are you holding up? I know how hard it is,’ she wrote.

‘One more interview tomorrow evening then the walk [in Rehtaeh’s memory],’ Parsons replied, ‘then will crash … I feel an emotional tsunami coming on.’

Todd replied ‘I am here for you.’

Relentless cyberbullying after alleged sexual assaults led both girls to take their own lives – Rehteah Parsons was 17, Amanda Todd 15-years-old.

Both girls were popular, cheerleaders and were driven to depression after pictures of the alleged assaults were passed around school and name calling hounded them online, the mothers said.The similarities don’t end there.

Amanda Todd was born Nov. 27, which Leah Parsons told the paper was supposed to be her daughter’s due date – Rehteah Parsons was born on Dec 9.

Warning sign: The girl had tried to commit suicide before

Rehteah Parsons hung herself on April 4 – Carol Todd’s birthday.

Amanda Todd received the final taunting message on Facebook that drove her over the edge on the same day Rehteah Parsons was reportedly assaulted.

Rehteah Parsons showed her mother the documentary about Amanda Todd.

‘She said, ‘Mom, you’ve got to come see this… I am just so upset because nobody cared about her when she was alive,’ the heartbroken mother recalls her daughter saying.

Rehteah Parsons was dead a month later.

The startling coincidences led Carol Todd to send Leah Parsons a Facebook message after she read a feature on the girl’s ordeal, they connected a month later.

Both women have also dealt with the possibility that Amanda Todd’s suicide may have catalyzed Rehteah Parsons urge to go down the same path.

They have also talked about the nearly identical path they have each walked the past year.

‘As much as our girls were parallel,’ said Todd, ‘we are parallel, too, in our emotions, our physical health, our tiredness.’

The women talk about other things, but everything always comes full circle.

‘[They] tried so hard to stand up for themselves,’ said Leah Parsons. ‘They were trying to get a message out there.

‘We are here to carry that message forward.’
