They say that your teenage years are supposed to be the best of your life, but Britain's over-fifties would definitely take issue with that.

The UK's middle-aged population aren't slowing down any time soon - in fact, new research shows that they are fast becoming the reckless generation. 

After years of saving towards pensions, looking after their offspring and taking care of their houses, the fifty-pluses are living life for the now, with sexual health and savings the first to take the hit.

In a new survey called the 50+ project, 76 per cent of those asked confessed to not using contraception when they have sex, despite rising rates of STD's across the country. 

The UK's middle-aged population aren't slowing down any time soon - new research shows that they are fast becoming the reckless generation. 76 per cent of 50-plus generation don't use contraception when having sex and 67 per cent of parents believe in spending their wealth over saving it for their children (pictured posed by model) 

And despite not using protection, the age group aren't slowing down when it comes to activity inside the bedroom. 

66 per cent of over-fifties believe that a good sex life is important and 38 per cent admit to having sex more than twice a week, on average.

It's no surprise that they are staying busy between the sheets though, given that 43 per cent of that age group believe they are a better lover now than ever before. 

The reckless behaviour isn't just restricted to the bedroom though, our middle aged population are also becoming increasingly carefree with their savings and property portfolios, with less concern for any inheritance to be passed on to their children. 

Although 42 per cent revealed they had more disposable income than ever, very few were considering sharing much of that with their sons and daughters.  

67 per cent of parents said they believe in spending their wealth over saving it for their children and · 24 per cent of parents are planning to leave little or none of their wealth to their children. 

The fifty-plus generation are spending their wealth on holidays and socialising. Half of the over-fifties admit they now go on holiday more now than ever before and 51 per cent also admit to drinking three or more times a week 

The figure is even higher for Brits aged between 60-65, with 71 per cent of them planning on spending their wealth instead of earmarking it for inheritance.  

While the younger generation aren't doing so well out of their parent's swollen bank accounts, the tourism and alcohol and hospitality industries are quids in. 

Half of the over-fifties admit they now go on holiday more now than ever before, with 53 per cent taking a vacation more than three times a year. 

Meanwhile, half of this demographic admit to drinking three or more times a week and 40 per cent also go out socially more than once a week. 

TV presenter Mariella Frostrup, who recently joined the 50-plus ranks and will celebrate her 52nd birthday next month, commissioned the research in her role as editor-at-large of High50 magazine. 

The mother-of-two says the findings reflect her own attitudes towards life at this age, including how much of her wealth she is planning on sharing with her children.

Se said: 'The survey naturally reflects some of my concerns and aspirations, as a recent entry to the High50 generation.

'It's a topic I've been talking about for a long time as way before I reached my landmark birthday I felt our attitude to maturity in the UK is not a healthy one and these days is leagues behind the reality of who we all are at fifty.  

'It shouldn't come as surprise that people over fifty aspire to a healthy sex life, we're still human after all and despite the myths around menopause and the rest we still have a beating pulse. 

'Much to my daughters' horror I still even like to dance, given the right venue, and the right companions!

'As for leaving money to our children I've seen enough trust fund simpletons to know that educating your kids to their best ability, teaching them how lucky they are to live in a country like ours where a safety net exists and showing them societies where it doesn't is far more important to their future than doing their saving for them. 

'I'd love to be able to give my kids a helping hand with a deposit for a flat or similar, it caused me the most anxiety when I was young. 

'But having managed without a penny of family money myself I hope they'll be proud and capable enough to do likewise.'
