Edward Gillespie was last seen at his work Christmas party and was due to stay at the hotel near Harlow, Essex, but his bed was never slept in

Police searching for a man who disappeared from his office Christmas party have called in marine units to scour a nearby river, but their search is being hampered by bad weather.

Edward Gillespie, 38, was last seen in the early hours of Saturday at the Roydon Marina Hotel near Harlow, Essex.

Police have searched the River Stort, river banks, the hotel and its grounds in an attempt to find Mr Gillespie who works for health and safety company Bureau Veritas.

A marine unit and a helicopter have been used. A police spokesman said high water levels due to recent rain were hampering the river search.

He comes from Rosslyn Crescent, Luton and the police have issued a photograph of Mr Gillespie wearing a Luton Town football scarf at the Johnstone's Paint Trophy final at Wembley in 2009.

The alarm was raised by relatives when he failed to return to home after the weekend.

He had booked to stay in the hotel but his bed had not been slept in and his belongings were still in his room.

His girlfriend flew over from South Africa on Christmas day and his family and friends have been using social networking sites Twitter and Facebook to organise searches and spread the word.

Six of his friends today found a body, thought to be Gwyn Morris, 88, in Feildes Weir Lock, Hoddesdon.

Mr Morris went missing from a care home in Stanstead Abbotts on 6 December.

They have vowed to continue looking for Mr Gillespie after the upsetting discovery.

His friend Daniel Salmon, who joined the police search on Christmas Eve, told the Harlow Star Mr Gillespie's disappearance was 'totally out of character'.

A picture of Mr Gillespie at the Christmas party was posted on the Facebook page Help find Eddie Gillespie as his friends and family have taken to social media to publicise the search

'We were supposed to be meeting up for pre-Christmas drinks in Luton on Saturday,' he said.

'When Ed didn't turn up, we thought he must have just got held up somewhere or come down with a cold, so we weren’t overly concerned at that point.

'But when we found out that he hadn't returned home over the weekend, we all started to worry.

'It’s just not like Ed to wander off somewhere without telling someone first, especially at this time of year. It’s totally out of character.'

Tottenham Hotspur ‏football club joined the campaign today, tweeting: '#Spurs fan Edward Gillespie missing since 22 Dec, last seen in Roydon, #Essex. Any info pls contact Harlow Police.'

His car was found to still parked at the hotel in Roydon. He was last seen wearing blue jeans, a blue and grey chequered long sleeved top and green trainers.

His friends and family have now set up a Facebook page - Help find Eddie Gillespie - to help coordinate the search.

David Brace posted on the page: 'This Christmas has a black cloud over for me. The build up to Christmas is the usual thing at Hendersons bar Roydon marina village in Roydon Essex. But this year on the 21/22 dec at a works function with work Mates from bureau veritas based in Harlow. Ed Gillespie who was staying in a hotel room at Roydon marina village went missing if anyone knows anything please call 101.'

While Hayley-Hope Newman tweeted: '#findedgillespie please please please RT! Ed has been missing a week and our hearts are breaking xox'

Chief Inspector David Colwell from Essex Police said: 'We are extremely concerned for Mr Gillespie's welfare. The search is continuing today with the support of the Essex Police helicopter, our marine unit and specialist teams.

'The teams will also be involved in searching more remote areas, waterways, boats and nearby caravans.

'Mr Gillespie had been attending a company party at the hotel and was due to stay overnight before checking out on Saturday morning. His car and belongings were at the hotel but there was no sign of Mr Gillespie.

'We want to hear from anyone who might have seen him, possibly walking around outside the hotel in the early hours of Saturday and we also appeal to all dog walkers or ramblers over the Christmas period to look out for Mr Gillespie, especially if they are walking across the open and remote areas in and around Roydon.'
