His fascination with taxidermy began after he found hedgehog bones under an outdoor building at primary school.

Now 12-year-old Archie Crawford shares his bedroom in Kidlington, Oxfordshire, with a 75-strong collection of stuffed animals - including a buzzard, raccoon, marmot and even an armadillo.

The boy, who first read about taxidermy online and also keeps roadkill in his family’s freezer, has stuffed squirrels, rats and mice - and his creations take pride of place in his room.

He said: ‘I love skeletons, fossils and skulls. I think taxidermy is really cool and I am going to keep practising until I am able to do it for my profession.

‘My favourite pieces of taxidermy are the ones that look like they are alive, like my armadillo, which was a present. I would love to be able to create that one day.

‘I love animals and nature, and I am really interested in creating my own pieces. Some people think it is an odd habit but most of my friends think it is interesting.’

Archie has even managed to convince his mother, Polly Branney, 47, to make some space in the family freezer for dead pheasants, squirrels, rabbits and moles which he is working on.

Mrs Branney, a GP, said: ‘It all started when Archie was seven and he found some bones at school.

‘I was shocked when he brought them home but we cleaned them up and he researched them on the internet and found out they were hedgehog bones. 

Archie, 12, said he is 'really dedicated' to taxidermy

'Archie reassembled them onto a piece of card and his love of bones and structures began from there.’

She added: ‘He loves the outdoors and it’s great that he has curiosity for nature. It’s not ideal keeping his animals in the freezer but I know how much it means to him.’

Mrs Branney said the first roadkill Archie picked up was a dead fox, which he carried home after spotting it at school.

She helped him cut it up and left it in the garden  to disintegrate before boiled the bones so he could work on his first piece.

The family currently have a squirrel and a skinned rabbit in the freezer of their detached four-bedroom house.

Mrs Branney said: ‘I help Archie dissect up the bits and it is a bit grisly but it doesn’t phase either of us.

'I think taxidermy is really up and coming, especially in America where lots of people have their pets stuffed. I am proud of his hobby.’

Archie added: ‘I want to be a taxidermist when I am older and I already know that I need to study art and science in order to do it, so that’s my aim. 

'I am really dedicated to it and would love to expand my collection to some larger animals - my mum says that’s fine, as long as they can all fit in my room.’
