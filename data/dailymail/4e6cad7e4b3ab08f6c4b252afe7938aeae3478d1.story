It has become an integral part of everyday life for so many Britons.

But six million adults never use the internet or go online only rarely, official figures revealed yesterday.

It may come as a shock to those who regularly buy goods online and email friends and family around the globe, but one in eight adults have little interest in discovering the online world and believe it holds little that can benefit them.

Internet use among the elderly: Around half of people over 65 do not even send or receive emails

According to the estimates, there are four million UK homes which have no internet connection and where no one uses a mobile phone connected to the web.

More than half of such families described the internet as ‘not useful’ and ‘not interesting’.

The level of resistance to the latest communications technology was revealed in a study by the Office for National Statistics.

It said only one in 100 homes not connected to the internet are off-line because broadband is not available in their area.

The report, based on the state-run Opinions and Lifestyles survey of 1,000 Britons every month, found that 38million people use the internet every day.

Rising daily internet use: Nearly three-quarters of the population buy goods or services over the internet

Nearly seven out of ten of those do so using their mobile phone.

A broadband internet connection has increasingly been seen as a basic utility, and nearly three-quarters of the population buy goods or services over the internet.

The most popular online purchases are clothes, with almost half of all adults buying them from internet retailers.

The report said: ‘The internet has changed the way people go about their daily lives. Over three-quarters of adults used the internet every day.’

It found that nine out of ten people aged 16 to 24 use social media, and the same proportion of 25 to 34-year-olds use the internet for buying goods and services, while seven out of ten of that group use online banking.

In contrast, around half of people over 65 do not even send or receive emails.

The study found that 6.5million people had not used the internet in the three months before they were interviewed, or had never used it.

‘Of the four million households without internet access, the majority said they did not have a connection because they did not need it,’ the report said.

But the ONS also suggested that some people who do not have an internet connection may be worried about whether they can use a computer.

Increasing figure: Almost all homes with children - 96 per cent - have an internet connection, the report said

The report added: ‘While this may suggest many households without the internet are actively choosing not to subscribe, there is still a large and important minority  who state that barriers prevent them  from connecting.’

Nearly a third of those who did not have a home internet connection said that this was because of ‘lack of skills’.

Almost all homes with children – 96 per cent – have an internet connection, the report said.

Among those who had never used the internet – 8 per cent of the population – were 28 per cent of retired people, and 8 per cent of those aged over 55.
