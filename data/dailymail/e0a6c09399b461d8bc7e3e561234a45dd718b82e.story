It took Serena Williams two months to go from the nadir of her Wimbledon embarrassment to Grand Slam champion in two months, emphatically claiming her 18th Grand Slam title on Sunday night.

The 32 year-old American equalled the Major tally of Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert by overcoming an edgy Caroline Wozniacki in the US Open final 6-3 6-3 in 75 minutes, reconfirming her position as the world's number one player.

After collapsing on the court in delight and trying, and failing, to surpress her emotion, she was presented by the two legends with an eighteen carat gold bracelet from Tiffany's marking the achievement. Next stop is the total of 22 Slam titles won by Steffi Graf.

In addition to the jewellry she received a cheque for $4 million (£2.41 million), comprising of her tournament winnings and a bonus for being the dominant player in the recent American events. It was the biggest single prize in tennis history.

This was a far cry from her Wimbledon departure, when a 'viral illness' saw her having to default from the doubles after losing all co-ordination.

She felt the key to recovery was the way she was able to re-dedicate herself after that by playing a heavy schedule leading in here: 'I think playing in all those tournaments really helped me, it gave me the calmness I needed as well,' she said.

'I practised so hard, in fact I've been practising hard for six months and that has really showed today. I was really tight and nervous, getting to eighteen has been on my shoulders for a long time. That probably weighed more than winning a sixth US Open. I never thought my name would be up with those legends, that's why I'm quite emotional.'

Wozniacki could not rouse herself to end this highly testing personal summer on a triumphant note, unable to match the firepower of her opponent, who successfully put their friendship to one side.

That was always going to be the case as these two have been trained from so young to be ruthless on court, so no quarter was given in an ultimately disappointing contest.

'You're an unbelievable friend and you owe me drinks later,' said Wozniacki afterwards, in a nice touch of old school. In truth perhaps their relationship may have marred the quality of the encounter, rather in the way many Serena versus Venus matches have also been flat.

Unless Williams suffered one of her Grand Slam implosions the 24 year-old Dane probably needed a policy of all out aggression to come off, and by the time she started to execute a more attacking game it was too late.

Aside from three aces, Wozniacki's first winner on her stronger backhand side did not come until the last game of the match, and by this time the defending champion was playing much better.

It has still been a fine effort from the Dane to pick herself from the trauma of her cancelled engagement, and a reward will be a return to the top 10.

Serena was already the oldest ever women's US Open champion coming into this, and even just short of her 33rd birthday she had still conceded only 26 games, an indication of her how strong her form has been.

In the lead-in to this tournament she had twice beaten the resurgent Wozniacki, who is yet to beat a number one player now in five attempts.

Williams was attempting to ensure that this would not be the first season since 2001 that she finished up without a Grand Slam when having entered all four of them - and that duly turned out to be the case.

Rory McIlroy had begun the morning by tweeting Carpe Diem (seize the day), and while he might have been referring to himself playing in Denver the romantic in you would like to believe there could have been a coded message in there.

Unfortunately there was little sign of it initially as Williams saved an early break point with an ace, and then the Dane sent down two double faults to go behind an immediate break.

Clearly nervous, she struggled with her first serve throughout the first set, but it was the erratic nature of her forehand that was damaging her the most and, although Serena was not at her punishing best, it was quite enough.

She broke three times to win the first set, despite having her own problems and being broken twice herself. An early break put distance between them in the second, and although the overall quality of the match picked up a Williams victory was never in doubt.

The younger sibling is an extraordinary athlete. The most baffling thing is that she did not get past the fourth round in any other of this season' s Majors.
