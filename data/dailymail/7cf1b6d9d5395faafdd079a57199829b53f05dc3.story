Spanish champions Atletico Madrid still owe £84m in unpaid tax according to the latest figures released by Spain’s football league (LFP).

Clubs in Spain have worked hard at driving down their tax debt and Atletico Madrid are sticking to a repayment scheme that has seen the sum they owe halved in the last two years.

But their debt remains at £84m and the total owed for Spain’s top two divisions is still a staggering £339m. Real Madrid and Barcelona, along with Osasuna and Athletic Bilbao, both enjoy a different tax status to the rest of the clubs in Spain and as part of that deal there is no public record of their fiscal situation though both big clubs are understood to be debt free.

Many clubs in Europe believe there has been various state assistance with Barcelona and Real Madrid

The figure from Atletico Madrid will upset many clubs in Europe who feel Spanish clubs have been propped up by various state assistance in recent years with Barca and Madrid’s tax status and a land deal between Madrid council and Real Madrid currently being investigated by the European Commission.

Other clubs will see this as further evidence that La Liga continues to be ripe for asset stripping with Atletico Madrid’s need to sell players every summer not likely to be changing in the near future.

The overall situation of clubs in Spain with those in the first division owing £237m and those in division two owing 178m goes a long way to explaining the exodus of talent from La Liga in recent seasons with clubs outside of the top two no longer able to hold on to their best players.

Atletico have had to sell several key players every summer, including Diego Costa who joined Chelsea

The LFP figures also show 13 clubs in the process of administration as they reduce their debts. Deportivo de la Coruña, who won the league in 2000, and the city of Barcelona’s second club, Espanyol, come in second and third in the league of shame.

Deportivo, who are in administration, owe £50m and Espanyol owe £35m, while Madrid-based clubs Rayo Vallecano and Getafe come in fifth and seventh in the table with debts of £27m and £11m respectively. In a determined effort to drive down debt in Spain LFP president Javier Tebas has vowed to stop clubs with unsustainable debts competing in the league.

Overall debt has been reduced from £475m euros to £379m in the last year although this LFP figure is disputed by Spain’s Inland Revenue who argue the figure remains closer to £445m.
