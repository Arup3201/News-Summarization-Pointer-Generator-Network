Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana has pulled out of the England squad to face Lithuania and Italy.

The squad are due to meet at St George's Park at lunchtime, but it is understood Lallana will not be among them.

The midfielder's groin injury flared up in the 2-1 defeat to Manchester United on Sunday and he will therefore miss the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania on Friday and England's friendly in Italy four days later.

Lallana was taken off at half-time and replaced by Steven Gerrard who was sent off after 38 seconds

England manager Roy Hodgson will be hoping to make it five wins from five in Euro 2016 qualifying

Lallana came off at half-time during the loss to Louis van Gaal's side. The player is understood to believe the injury is not too serious. 

The rest of the now 23-man England party is due to meet in Burton on Monday afternoon and will be assessed to see whether there will be any more withdrawals.

England will be looking to make it five qualifying wins from five on Friday night before they head to Turin for a friendly against the nation that beat them in their World Cup opener last summer.

It is understood Friday's match against Lithuania at Wembley is a 90,000 sell-out.
