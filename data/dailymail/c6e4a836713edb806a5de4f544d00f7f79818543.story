'We are marking a significant step change in our investment into growth markets around the world.

'The welcome of Oasis of the Seas to Southampton is followed next year by sister ship Allure of the Seas sailing outside the Caribbean for the first time during a summer 2015 season based in Barcelona.

'These investments highlight our commitment to deliver the most innovative and architecturally advanced ships to Europe and are part of our ongoing effort to redefine the cruise sector.

'Our extensive investments into new ships, new technology and new ideas are increasing the appeal of the cruise sector around the world.'
