The family of a teenage mother who snatched her baby daughter from a foster family during a supervised visit have said her actions were an 'act of desperation'.

Police are searching for Stacey Ball, 18, after she bundled 13-month-old Lola Page into a car in Walsall, West Midlands.

But yesterday Miss Ball's father, Ryan Price, 46, said his daughter is simply 'screaming out for help' because she had been informed her daughter would be put up for adoption.

Search: Ball, pictured in a blonde wig bundled the toddler into her car three days ago

'We don't know where Stacey is, we haven't heard from her. We are waiting for her to call.

'The first we heard was from the police on Friday afternoon. We went out looking for her but we don't know where she is.

'She
 has her own flat but she has been staying with a friend for some of the
 time. Stacey has been driven to this. It is an act of desperation.

'She had her baby taken away from her nine months ago and she has seen her three times a week since.

Social services came in contact with the family because of a violent relationship between Miss Ball and Lola's (pictured) father

Lola was said to have been listed for adoption

West Midlands Police are growing increasingly concerned for the vulnerable pair as their search continued into a third day

'But
 then when social services told her she was up for adoption she was 
desperate. She didn't think she would see her again and no one was 
listening to her. She has been doing everything that they have asked of her and she is a good mum.

'She loves that baby, she wasn't kidnapping but just doing what any mother would do.'

Mr Price said his daughter became involved with social services because of a violent relationship with the baby's father.

'She has done nothing,' he added. 'She is just a mother screaming out for help.

'We are really worried about her and the baby. She is my granddaughter.'

Lola's 23-year-old father Stephen Page, who admitted he had not seen his daughter 'for about five months', yesterday denied acting violently towards Miss Ball.

He claimed social services had been monitoring Lola since birth because of concerns about Miss Ball's family, adding: 'I just want Lola found safe and well.'

Miss Ball's Facebook page has not been updated since Tuesday. But a message apparently directed at Mr Page from last June hints at a breakdown in their relationship, warning: 'You have lost your daughter and me.'

A second Facebook page in her name states that she worked at 'Play Boy and Play Girl Bunny Entertainment'.

Stacey's brother Leon Ball, 22, a 
self-employed hairdresser, added: 'She is not a bad person but she has 
been left with no choice.

'She couldn't face her baby being taken away.'

Yesterday police were growing increasingly concerned for the vulnerable pair as their search continued into a third day.

Detective Chief Inspector Matt Markham, of West Midlands Police, said: 'There
 haven't been any sightings of Stacey or Lola since they went missing 
and both police and the local authority are extremely worried about 
their welfare.

'Lola was
 in the care of social services at the time of her disappearance and we 
urgently need Stacey to make contact with us or anyone who may know 
their whereabouts.'

Lola is described by police as white with short straight blonde hair 
and was wearing a white cardigan and blue polka dot dress when she was 
taken.

Stacey is white, thin build and was wearing a long black wig, 
black leggings and a black and tan patterned dress when she left with 
her daughter.

John Hemming, the Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley, set up Justice for Families to help people who believe their children have been wrongly taken into care.

He said: 'If a child is taken into care, it's more likely to be adopted than not.

'But it's a criminal offence to take a baby like this and this will make it very difficult for the mother now.'

If you have seen them or if you know where they are, please call West 
Midlands Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
