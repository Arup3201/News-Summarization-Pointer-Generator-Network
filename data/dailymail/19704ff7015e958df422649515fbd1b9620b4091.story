Jamie Donaldson has some advice for the US taskforce looking to end their embarrassing series of defeats against Europe in the Ryder Cup, and it's really rather simple: just enjoy it.

Europe have won eight of the last 10 Ryder Cups and the secret to their success, according to Donaldson, is nothing but having fun together.

The Welshman - whose stunning wedge to two feet of the pin was the shot that sealed the cup for Paul McGinley's side at Gleneagles last month - said that laughter helped them to cope when their opponents piled on the fiercest pressure.

Ballantine’s asked Donaldson to name a defining moment, or ‘Moment of Truth’, in his golfing history, with the player signing his answer on the camera. Donaldson wrote ‘My first win!’ in reference to his Irish Open victory

'It’s difficult to comment on the American team but we seemed to just gel better as a team and enjoy the experience,' said Donaldson.

'When the European team gets together we have a thoroughly good craic and enjoy each other’s company, which helps us play well under pressure in my view.'

Donaldson tees it up at the BMW Masters in Shanghai this week hoping to cap the most special year of his career with a big victory in one of the European Tour's flagship Final Series events. He made a promising start, shooting a four-under-par round of 68 to sit in sixth place, three shots behind leader Alexander Levy.

But for years, Donaldson was a journeyman pro, a decent player touring the world with no tournament wins to his name, due in no small part to an ongoing back problem. One specialist even advised him to give up golf for good.

Thankfully for Europe and McGinley he paid no notice. Donaldson's first victory came at Royal Portrush two years ago and he is now reaching the pinnacle of his career at the age of 39. That laser-guided wedge on the 15th hole of the Centenary Course remains the defining shot not just of his 4&3 victory over Keegan Bradley but also of this year's Ryder Cup.

'It was huge for me and the European team. This has been my most exciting season without doubt,' he said.

'Winning my first European Tour title, the Irish Open in 2012, was pretty special. It had taken a lot of hard work to get that point and a lot of tournaments.'

But speaking of finding those elusive keys to victory, Donaldson has another more personal one to share.

'My good form also coincided with me having kids, so I think that may be the secret to my success,' he said.
