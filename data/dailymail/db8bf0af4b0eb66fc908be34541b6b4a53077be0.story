With his naked indiscretions and questionable fancy dress choice, Prince Harry has cemented his reputation as the Royal Family's standalone party animal.

But despite his fun-loving reputation, the prince's behaviour pales in comparison to some of his distant relatives.

Surrounding themselves in the world of bohemia and frequenting London's smoke-filled jazz clubs in the early 1930s, the then Prince of Wales and his brother Prince George indulged in a life of hedonism.

Antics: While Prince Harry has a reputation as a party animal, his antics are nothing compared to distant relative Prince George, right, who frequented jazz clubs in the early 1930s

Exploits: Prince George's exploits, alongside his brother the Prince of Wales, feature in a new BBC series Dancing on the Edge. Prince George is pictured here in the drama

Scandal: Director of the series, Stephen Poliakoff said that Prince George's antics in London's jazz clubs would cause 'enormous scandal' in this day and age

That is according to a BBC documentary that charts the brothers' unlikely relationship with the city's black musicians in the pre-war era.

Unlike the constant media attention enjoyed by Prince Harry, which recently prompted him to express his dismay at the intrusion, the old Princes' exploits went largely unnoticed due to protective press barons.

The series, Dancing on the Edge, is inspired by the siblings' scandalous exploits, with stories of affairs and drug use.

The five-part series, written and directed by Stephen Poliakoff, was based on diaries from the 1930s that he used for research.

It hints at the Prince of Wales, later Edward VIII, and the Duke of Kent's questionable behaviour, which he says would prompt 'enormous scandal' in this day and age.

Indulgent: The Prince of Wales, left, later Edward VIII, and his brother the Duke of Kent, right, were said to have lived an 'indulgent life' but protective press barons did not report on their behaviour 

Describing Prince George's antics as much worse than anything Prince Harry would get up to, Mr Poliakoff said: 'He was much worse. There’s no 
comparison. It was a very indulgent life. I don’t think anybody knew the
total truth about it, but there were stories of a series of affairs and
drugs.'

While the series is largely fictional, the director said the stories told are 'absolutely historically accurate'.

One
scene recalls a notorious event in which the Prince of Wales drummed 
with big band legend Duke Ellington for four hours in front of a crowd.

The director described the pre-war period as an 'extraordinary moment across class and race', telling the Daily Telegraph: 'The idea of Prince Charles drumming with a band and giving them nicknames would be thought extreme in our time.'

Debut: Dancing on the Street will be broadcast on BBC Two at 9pm on Monday

He explained that press barons such as Lord Beaverbrook 'ensured nothing untoward about them would appear'.

The series, which follows the fictional Louis Lester Band, will be broadcast on BBC Two on Monday at 9pm.

The group's journey is explored against the socio-political issues of the time, as an aristocrat played by Jacqueline Bisset supports the band.

Chiwetal Ejifor stars in an impressive cast featuring Caroline Quentin, John Hopkins and Hollywood star john Goodman.
