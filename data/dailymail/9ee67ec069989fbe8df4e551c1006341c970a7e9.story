Awkwardness: Author Kate Fox has suggested that the English are unsure how to greet each other

England is the only country where people are unsure of how to greet each other, according to an expert - and the only remedy is to revive an old-fashioned phrase.

Social anthropologist Kate Fox claims that the demise of the greeting 'How do you do?' has created awkwardness as English people no longer know how to say hello to each other.

However, she points out that conversations about the weather often fulfil the function of forming social bonds - in the same way as apes groom each other.

And she also suggests that the rise of social media has enabled the English to overcome their habitual reticence and open up to strangers.

Ms Fox's best-selling book, Watching the English, which chronicles the habits and foibles of her fellow countrymen, was reissued this year to take account of how the country has changed in the decade since it was first published.

Speaking at the Hay Festival on Friday, she said that one of the biggest obstacles to more openness among the English was the difficulty of knowing what to say when you first meet someone, according to the Telegraph.

'I know people think that "How do you do?" is an archaic, stuffy, sort of upper classy-type thing to say,' she said.

'But we really should be mounting a campaign for its revival because since "How do you do?" declined as a standard greeting we haven't known what to say.

'We don't know what to do with our hands, we don't know whether to kiss once or twice. Every single other nation on the planet has a straightforward ritual for greeting someone. We seem to be the only ones who can't reach a consensus on what's appropriate.'

At the talk, Ms Fox also compared the English habit of talking about the weather to chimpanzees picking fleas off each other - because both are largely meaningless rituals which contribute to 'social bonding'.

She added: 'When you say, "Oh gosh isn't it cold", you're not asking for a meteorological report. It's a way of saying hello, or "I'd like to talk to you", without having to say anything quite so direct.'

Astute: Ms Fox, a social anthropologist, is a seasoned observer of English habits and foibles

The updated edition of Watching the English chronicles the changes in the English national character since the book originally came out in 2004.

And the biggest change of all, according to Ms Fox, is the way the internet and social media allow people to connect without the awkwardness of face-to-face interaction.

She told the Hay audience that social networking facilitated the exchange of even the most intimate information - but the ubiquitous smartphone allows people to avoid others' glances in public.

Ms Fox's analysis of English culture has previously highlighted how minute class distinctions can be determined by how we speak - for example, the upper-middle-class habit of saying 'sofa' instead of 'settee'.
