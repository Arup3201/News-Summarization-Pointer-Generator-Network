The model muse of French designer Yves Saint Laurent is auctioning her 12,000-piece haute couture wardrobe, an historic collection of creations by fashion masters such as YSL, Claude Montana, Azzedine Alaia, Paco Rabanne, Thierry Mugler, Christian Lacroix and Francois Lesage.

Danielle Luquet de Saint Germain, who was born in Lyons but has lived in Geneva since the 1970s, is credited with being the inspiration behind Saint Laurent's groundbreaking 'le smoking' tuxedo for women, his see-through blouse and the YSL safari jacket.

Their partnership began when Luquet arrived at her first casting with the designer in the 1960s, aged 19, wearing male clothes - a trenchcoat and man's trousers - and the designer was so intrigued he asked her to leave the clothes behind for him to 'inspire himself' with.

The collection includes a black, see-through chiffon dress decorated with ostrich feathers, expected to fetch over £12,500, and a satin 'Picasso' dress embellished with embroidery by Francois Lesage, predicted to go for no less than £10,000.

Saint Laurent, who died in 2008, once said of his muse: 'I had nothing to teach her; on the contrary, it was she who helped free me of all the outdated references I had.'

Françoise Sternbach, a member of the French Union of Professional Art Experts who helped curate the auction, told Women's Wear Daily: 'I know everyone will focus on the YSL pieces, which are magnificent, but I tell you there are dresses here by Claude Montana which would not have existed without her. They are one-offs, prototypes designed especially for her.'

Luquet, known during her modelling 
days as 'the red-haired model', rarely appears in public now and has 
been keeping her clothes in pristine condition.

Georges
Delettrez, the auction house who are looking after the sale which 
begins in October with a 350-piece lot, said the petite former model had
cared extremely well for the clothes and kept them in a 'museum-like' 
state of preservation.

Luquet is credited with providing inspiration for YSL's legendary safari suits, here being modelled at the designer's last ever show, in Paris in January 2002

Luquet inspired YSL's 'le smoking' tuxedos for women because of her petite, androgynous look and her predilection for dressing in men's clothes
