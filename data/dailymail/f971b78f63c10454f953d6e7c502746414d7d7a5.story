The diamond is dazzling and so is the price. This flawless 59.60-carat gem, known as the Pink Star, is expected to go for more than £40million at auction next month.

That will make the huge diamond, one of the world’s rarest and with an extraordinary depth of colour, the most valuable jewel ever to be sold.

Discovered in South Africa in 1999 by mining giant De Beers, the pink gem was polished and cut over two years.

Pricey: The 59.60-carat stone is expected to sell for more than £40million

Quite the ornament: The Pink Star is the largest internally flawless pink diamond that the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) has ever graded

Bids at the ready: The gem will go on sale in Geneva next month

The oval-cut stone is more than twice the size of the Graff Pink diamond that was sold for a world record £29million in 2010.

Sotheby’s, which will auction the Pink Star in Geneva, described it as ‘exceptional’.

Spokesman David Bennett said: ‘It is difficult to exaggerate the rarity of vivid pink diamonds weighing only five carats, so this 59.60-carat stone is simply off the scale and passes, I believe, into the ranks of the Earth’s greatest natural treasures.’

The gem belongs to small group of diamonds – known as type 11a – that are renowned for their transparency and chemical purity.
