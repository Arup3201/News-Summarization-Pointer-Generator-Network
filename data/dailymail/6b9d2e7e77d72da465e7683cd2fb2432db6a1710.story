The D word is now officially part of the Indian Premier League (IPL) spot-fixing scandal. Delhi Police chief Neeraj Kumar says he has incontrovertible evidence linking the sordid saga to its D-company masters in Pakistan and Dubai.

He told Mail Today: "We have extensive details of phone numbers based abroad in Karachi and Dubai highlighting the network and apparatus. 

"We are very clear that this is organised crime and that the entire operation was run by the underworld syndicate as a triangulated play: Mumbai-Pakistan-Dubai."

All roads lead to Dawood: Delhi Police believe infamous gangster Dawood Ibrahim (left) and his longstanding aide Chhota Shakeel (right) have been running a spot-fixing network through their underworld contacts in several countries 

On Tuesday, the Delhi Police named underworld Don Dawood Ibrahim and his close aide Chota Shakeel as co-accused in the case, saying fixing was done at their behest.

Ironically, the dramatic move came on a day that saw Chennai Super Kings principal Gurunath Meiyappan, actor Vindoo Randhawa and seven other accused in a parallel betting probe being granted bail by a Mumbai court.

The Delhi Police said that the command for spot-fixing originated from underworld don Dawood Ibrahim's outfit. Asserting that the main bookies Ramesh Vyas, Tinku Mandi and even the cricketers were in direct touch with the fugitive don, the police invoked the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against disgraced cricketer S. Sreesanth and 22 others in the case.

That there was mafia-style muscle-flexing involved has been made clear by Delhi's top cop.

"We have intercepts of top bookie Sunil Bhatia threatening cricketers and anybody else who needed to be threatened, saying clearly that the underworld wants this done or you are imperiled. The size and scale of the operation is humungous. Let me tell you that the extent of the malfeasance is widespread and the rot has set in deep. Money running into thousands of crores is changing hands with the hawala route back in our crosshairs," he said.

Shakeel on Tuesday confirmed Kumar's assertion. In an exclusive telephonic interview with Aaj Tak, Shakeel said: "Yes, we threaten bookies, cricketers and filmstars. We threaten them when it is required. But this doesn't means that we are involved in spot-fixing."

Kumar explained that bail is going to be that much more difficult since the offences are now in the domain of organised crime.

"And anyone who partakes in this conspiracy becomes an accused," he said.

What MCOCA does is give Delhi Police that much more time to interrogate all the accused and take every lead to its logical culmination.

"We want to file the chargesheet as early as possible. We are also examining the role of another team and three other players by connecting the dots," Kumar added.

A senior police official associated with the probe said they had enough call intercepts to showed the bookies had made calls to Dubai, Karachi and other cities of Pakistan to fix and alter betting rates.

"Efforts are also underway to nab a Hyderabad-based person who could lead to the door of another cricket team whose players were allegedly involved in spot-fixing. The person was named by bookie Mohammed Yahya, arrested in Hyderabad, during his questioning," the official added.

Explaining its MCOCA move, the police said: "Since the accused persons were acting on command of people based abroad like Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar and Chota Shakeel who have a continuous past record of organised crimes, provisions of MCOCA have been invoked against the accused."

Detailing Dawood's role in the fixing scandal, the police said that Dawood's syndicate controlled gambling in India through hawala channels and also fixed the rates of gambling.

"This organised crime syndicate besides controlling illegal betting was indulging in fixing performance of players and rates of betting," the police said.

Bollywood actor Vindoo Dara Singh, arrested in the IPL spot-fixing scam, was till recently a director in the Jaipur's leading jewellery firm - Motisons Jewellers - which belongs to the two absconding bookie-brothers Sanjay Chhabra alias Sanjay Jaipur and Sandeep Chhabra alias Pawan Jaipur.

IT department during a massive raid conducted last year on Motisons' premises had unearthed unaccounted money to the tune of about Rs 100 crore plus assets and gold worth around Rs 2 crore.

At that time, the department failed to comprehend the significance of Vindoo's connection with the Motisons Jewellers. Vindoo was arrested after the investigators traced his calls to the two brothers.

Invocation of MCOCA against accused in the spot-fixing case might appear to be a fillip for the Delhi Police in strengthening its case, but its sustainability is questionable in the court of law, according to legal experts.

Lawyers feel MCOCA has been slapped in this case only for the purpose of denying bail to the accused. According to legal luminaries, slapping of MCOCA against the accused is not relevant in this case and it will be a Herculean task for police to justify the invocation of this harsh act before the court after filing of the charge-sheet.

Senior advocate Aman Lekhi explained: "For MCOCA to be attracted against anybody, elements of violence, coercion and intimidation should be there. But it seems to be absolutely missing in the case. It will be very difficult for police to justify MCOCA in this case." By Sana Shakil

Underworld don Dawood Ibrahim's close aide Chhota Shakeel revealed that many cricketers and bookies were in touch with D-company and were threatened.

In an exclusive telephone interview with Aaj Tak, Shakeel said: "Yes we threaten bookies, cricketers and film-stars. We threaten them when it is required. But this doesn't mean that we are involved in spot-fixing."

When asked that under pressure of D-company many cricketers were forced to execute deals relating to spot-fixing, Shakeel said D-company is close to many bookies.

"We speak to many players but we do not want to take their names. Will it be fair if I reveal that I have given money to some players," he added.

On charges of operating one of the biggest cricket-betting syndicate in South Asia, Shakeel said: "Is betting a crime? Lot of people bet in the world. Should it be brought under MCOCA?"

Shakeel was of the view that Chhota Rajan should also be put under the scanner in the betting case.
