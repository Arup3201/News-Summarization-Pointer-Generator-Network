A man has been mauled by a pack of dingos in a vicious attack on an island off Queensland, which left him in hospital with wounds to his head and body.

Dane Allen was in the Happy Valley township of Fraser Island, which is located of the south-east coast of Queensland, when he apparently walked down to the beach to make a phone call.

The 25-year-old was on his own about 10.30pm on Monday evening when suddenly found himself in the company of four dingoes, according to news.com.au.

Paramedics told the website they believe Mr Allen managed to scare one of the animals away, but the other three were undeterred and went at him.

The man, who works as a chef on the island, suffered puncture wounds to his heads, legs and backside before he escaped and was discovered by fishermen nearby.

His clothes were shredded off and remnants of these items were apparently still on the beach on Tuesday morning.

David Anderson, Fraser Island spokesman, said Mr Allen was lucky to escape without any life-threatening injuries.

'He covered himself to protect his face and throat, stomach and groin; he was lucky because he was able to protect himself,' Mr Anderson said.

Mr Allen was taken to Hervey Bay Hospital back on the mainland of Queensland.

Residents told the website he had been employed at the Fraser Island Retreat at Happy Valley - on the eastern side of the island - for about eight months.

The attack has prompted rangers on the island to say they will up their rounds in the area, where dingo attacks have occurred before.

Happy Valley is fenced against dingoes, and a longer fence spanning almost 2 kilometres was completed last month on the island.

The Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service issued a warning for visitors to be extra vigilant in light of the incident, and said people should not walk or jog along the beaches alone at night.

In 2001 nine-year-old Clinton Gage was attacked and killed by two dingoes near Waddy Poiny on Fraser Island, about 50 kilometres south of the Happy Valley township.

Following his death, more than 30 dingoes were culled on the island - which caused outcry from the local residents.

At the end of 2012, rangers killed a six-month-old dingo called Inky for fears he would seriously injure a human when he grew older, after a series of attacks on people on the island.

In 2001 a nine-year-old boy was killed when he was attacked by a pair of dingoes on the same island
