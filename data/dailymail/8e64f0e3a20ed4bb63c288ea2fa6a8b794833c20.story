The tiny dog cage a foster mother kept the four-year-old child she is accused of murdering trapped in was wheeled out in court yesterday for jurors to see during the trial for first-degree murder, kidnapping and child abuse.

Rilya Wilson vanished in 2000 under the nose of Florida's child welfare agency while she was under the care of Geralyn Graham, 66. Her body has never been found.

Authorities long suspected Graham in Rilya's disappearance, but didn't charge her until 2005 when prosecutors said she confessed to an inmate while serving time on an unrelated fraud charge.

Prosecutors brought the wire dog cage into the court room yesterday and placed it in front of the jurors as Graham's friend Detra Coakley Winfield testified she loaned it to her specifically to keep the child in.

Vanished: Rilya Wilson, 4, was missing for two years before the state of Florida realized and began to search for her

Caged: Detra Coakley Winfield testifies in a Miami-Dade Criminal Court last November about the steel dog cage, left, she loaned Geralyn Graham to put Rilya Wilson in before the four-year-old child disappeared

She said Graham asked to borrow it 
and told her it was so she could keep the four-year-old in it at night 
'to stop her from doing harm to herself'.

However she did admit she had never seen her inside the cage.

Graham has always maintained that a 
child welfare worker took Rilya from her home in January 2001 and never 
returned her. Her disappearance was not discovered until April 2002, 
leading to major reforms at the Florida Department of Children and 
Families.

Winfield was also asked earlier in 
the week about how Rilya was cared for and admitted she once saw her 
confined to a laundry room as punishment for bad behavior, according to The Miami Herald.

'I saw her in timeout but I never saw
 her in the dog cage,' she said, adding that she had never saw Graham 
strike the child once.

She also said she often seemed 'sad' during her eight-month stay at the Graham home and once saw her play with feces.

'To me, she had some issues, some mental issues,' Winfield told jurors yesterday.

Trial: Rilya (right) disappeared in 2000 aged four. Her foster mother, Geralyn Graham, now 66, is on trial more than a dozen years later

Graham told her Rilya, who was taken 
into care after being born to a crack-addicted mom, was taken to New 
York by a Spanish lady who had befriended her before being taken away by
 DCF.

On Wednesday, another family friend, 
Laquica Tuff, told jurors that she saw Rilya with scratches and a gash 
on her forehead about two months before the girl’s disappearance.

Lost: Rilya's body has never been found

She also said Graham told her the same story about her being taken to New York by a friend.

In the afternoon, a crime scene detective dispatched to Graham's home in Kendall in 2004, more than three years after Rilya disappeared and after the family had already moved, testified that little forensic evidence was found at the home except for latent evidence of human bodily fluid or blood in the garage, according to Local10.com.

Graham's attorney raised the possibility that Rilya could still be alive because her body has not been found.

Attorney Scott Sakin suggested Rilya 
could've been relocated to a new home and lost in a system that has a 
history of caseworker incompetence.

Sakin also reminded jurors that jailhouse snitches have much to gain for helping out prosecutors.

'Is there any evidence at all that 
this child is dead?' Sakin said. 'Where is the body? We don't have to 
prove that she's alive. They have to prove that this child is dead.'

Prosecutors said Graham confessed to 
killing Rilya, who would be 16 now, because she believed the girl was 
evil and possessed by demons.

Rilya and a younger sister were both 
given over to state care because their drug-addicted, frequently 
homeless mother could not care for them.

Rilya's name is an acronym for 'remember I love you always' given by her birth mother.

One now-retired DCF supervisor, 
Willie Harris, testified that in April 2000 he received a call from 
Graham claiming Rilya's first foster home was 'deplorable' and might be 
unsafe.

Accused: Geralyn Graham is sworn by a judge, pictured, at Miami-Dade Criminal Court where she is charged with the murder of Rilya Wilson, who was in her care when she vanished in 2000

Testimony: Mrs Winfield told the court that she saw the girl in timeout but never saw her in the dog cage she provided, adding that she had never saw Graham strike the child once

Rilya's younger sister was living 
with Graham and her unrelated companion, Pamela Graham, and Rilya had 
recently visited their house.

Harris said he decided to remove 
Rilya from the first foster home when he was denied access to 
investigate its condition. He took the girl to the Grahams' home.

'I thought it would be necessary to 
remove the child because I couldn't prove whether she was at risk or not
 at risk,' Harris testified.

The key to the case, both sides agree, is the testimony of career criminal Robin Lunceford, who befriended Graham in jail.

Lunceford claims that Graham, 
referring to Rilya as 'it,' told her she smothered the girl with a 
pillow and buried the remains near water 'because water represented 
peace,' Weintraub told jurors. Another inmate also claims that Graham 
confessed at a different time.

Weintraub said Lunceford was reluctant to snitch but 'couldn't stomach' knowing about the death of a child.

'If you tell me you killed an 
innocent child, I'm going to snitch, and I'm going to snitch proud. 
Because it's different,' Weintraub quoted Lunceford as telling 
detectives.

Lunceford had been facing a life 
sentence as a repeat offender but has had her sentence reduced to 10 
years because of her cooperation, court records show. With time off for 
good behavior, she could be released by the end of December, Sakin 
pointed out.

'She's a rat,' Sakin said. 'Robin Lunceford would do anything, anything, to get out of prison.'

Graham also has a checkered past, 
including a history of convictions for fraud. Authorities said she has 
used 47 different aliases and had 10 different driver's licenses when 
she was arrested.

Weintraub said Graham forged 
documents falsely claiming she was Rilya's grandmother in order to 
collect state benefits — even after police believed the girl was dead.

The trial resumes on Tuesday.
