It's every guy's dream: lounging  in a t-shirt and shorts, making millions while sitting in a comfy chair playing video games.

For 22-year-old Matt Haag, this is a reality.

Haag makes almost a million dollars a year as a professional video game player -- yes, you read that correctly. 

The Chicago native began competitively playing video games in 2007 and has since grown to be one of the biggest faces in the world of competitive gaming -- or e-sports.

Known as Nadeshot -- short for 'Grenade Shot' -- Haag makes his living, as part of a team called OpTic Gaming, playing the popular war game Call of Duty, according to the New York Times. 

Just three years ago, Haag was working at McDonald's in his hometown of Chicago, and now he has a lucrative contract to live-stream his daily gaming sessions with Major League Gaming, a sports organization.

He and his teammates recently lived in Venice Beach, Calif., on the dime of one of his sponsors: Red Bull.

The Times reports that Haag travels the world as Nadeshot packing arenas as people watch him play tournaments. Haag has a huge fan base with more than a million YouTube subscribers and more than 800,000 Twitter followers.

 Relatable: Haag has such a large following because teenagers find YouTube sensations more relatable than the photo-shopped Hollywood celebrities

The Times hails Haag as the face of video games as a spectator sport, which is still a growing business. 

Business Insider reports that Haag's unusual profession isn't as easy as it sounds. Haag reportedly practices with his teammates for hours a day and is monitored by a sports technologist, who monitors the effects of video games on Haag's brain. 

Haag has sponsorship deals and live-streams on his YouTube channel, which brings in the big bucks.

The Times reports that Haag has such a large following because teenagers find YouTube sensations more relatable than the photo-shopped Hollywood celebrities. 

Haag's fans feel a connection to him and the Times reports that some even said they feel as if they would be friends with Haag if they knew him in real life. 

Maybe his YouTube channel is all the 'real life' connection his fans need. On his channel 'OpTic NaDeSHot' Haag posts a wide range of videos including his gaming sessions and even peeks into his personal  life where he shows his friends and takes his viewers with him on his trips to Ikea.
