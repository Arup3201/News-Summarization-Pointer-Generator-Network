Sneaky but super-clever street artist Banksy is counting down the final days of his highly-entertaining (and highly-controversial) New York 'residency'.

And despite a strong opposition from police, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and some of the property owners that have had their buildings used as a canvas, locals are embracing the creative installments of the British prankster while they last.

The graffiti artist - whose visit to the Big Apple will culminate on Halloween - has hit all five NYC boroughs over the past few weeks, secretly spraying buildings and walls and posting pictures of the works on his website.

But by leaving out the actual addresses, he has started a manhunt among the masses who are keen to see the pieces up close.

Those who have located the sites have been busy attempting to create their own photo art.

Embracement: New Yorkers are getting behind the numerous street art of British prankster that are popping up all over the city. The controversial artist finished up in NYC on Halloween. Here a child poses under a piece in Brooklyn

Kisses: A dancer poses with a Banksy installment painted on the front door of the Hustler Club in Hells Kitchen. The artist is known for his anti-authoritarian black-and-white stenciled images, which have sold at auction for upwards of $2 million

Off with his head: This image of a boy with a hammer popped up next to a regular fire hydrant on the Upper West Side

The project, called 'Better Out Than In', has been a precarious one.

Many of the pieces have either been erased or defaced by other people.

Some owners, however, are going to great lengths to preserve the artwork.

Banksy pieces have sold for up to $2 million.

The 'Ghetto 4 Life' piece in the South Bronx, featuring a child purportedly spraying the message on a wall, is being watched by two overnight guards.

Building owner David Damaghi said he hired the men in order to protect the painting for as long as possible.

Sadly, an amazing sculpture of the Sphinx of Giza, made out foam, cement and cinder-blocks that was erected on a sidewalk in Queens, has already been dismantled.

The New York Post reported that an art gallery representative paid the owner of a nearby auto-gass shop to recruit a team and load the piece onto a moving truck.

Some two dozen Banksy fans who had tracked down the installation are said to have watched on in dismay while it happened.

All gone: Sadly this replica of the Sphinx of Giza, made in Queens from smashed cinderblocks, has been dismantled

Banksy followers are waiting with avid anticipation to see what his final installment will be.

Because he chose the whole month of October for his New York artists residency, the final day is ofcourse Halloween.

The first All Hallows Eve-themed piece arrived on Friday and it was by far the most elaborate to date.

Situated inside a fenced-off area at Houston and Bowery, it featured a Grim Reaper dummy endlessly riding around in a bumper car.

Hundreds of enthusiasts crowded around the chain-link fence eager to nab a photo of the dramatic installation.

It was the first piece to be unveiled at night and was located at the old site of the now-closed Billy's Antiques and Props, a shop known for its irreverant antiques and oddities.

Freaky: Many passers-by said they had no idea what was going on when they stumbled across the artwork. Banksy is only identifying his pieces on his website, so many are walking straight past his work every day without knowing

Mob: Banksy enthusiast are growing everyday, but they only have five days left. He finished up his work in New York on Halloween

However not everyone is a fan of Banksy.

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg publicly condemned the artist, saying that graffiti is not art.

'Art is art, and nobody’s a bigger supporter of the arts than I am,' Bloomberg said this week.

'I just think there are some places for art, and there are some places (for) no art.

'And you running up to someone’s property or public property and defacing it is not my definition of art.'

'Graffiti is a sign of decay.'

Banksy has also clashed with the NYPD.

Promising to unveil a new piece every day for the month October, the artist put up a message on his website on Wednesday saying that the day's art had been cancelled 'due to police activity'.

Rumors started that Banksy and his two assistants had been busted in Brooklyn's 79th precinct, which covers the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.

It was also reported that the NYPD were actively hunting him, hoping to shut down his operation.

However the police said there was no such vendetta.

Banksy finishes in New York City on October 31, when the final piece will be revealed.
