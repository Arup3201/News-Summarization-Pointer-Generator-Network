Sepp Blatter already has the support of four of the six FIFA confederations to stand for a fifth term as president next year, by which time he will be 79.

The leaders of Asia, Africa, North and Central America, and South America are understood to have pledged their backing last month.

The verbal endorsement took place at the presidents’ meeting before the last FIFA ExCo summit ahead of the World Cup draw in Brazil.

Five alive: Sepp Blatter looks set for a fifth term as FIFA president after getting the support of four of the six confederations

Lacking fizz: Jerome Champagne has admitted he stands no chance if Blatter stands again for the FIFA presidency

And African federation president Issa Hayatou went a step further by confirming his organisation’s championing of Blatter in a letter to the FIFA overlord.

No wonder former FIFA executive Jerome Champagne, who launched his fanciful bid for the presidency in London this week, admits he has no chance if Blatter stands again.

Blatter has said he will make up his mind before this summer’s World Cup. But as long as he remains in good health, only massive opposition from daughter Corinne or his new girlfriend Linda Barras is likely to deter him.

Southampton's reclusive owner 
Katharina Liebherr, who has appointed herself chairman after the 
departure of Nicola Cortese, is said to have little or no football 
knowledge.

But she can at 
least take advice from two neighbours in her home village of Wollerau on
 Lake Zurich who do know their sport — Roger Federer and Felipe Massa.

There is still no publication date in
 sight for the most long-awaited football autobiography — Ken Bates’s 
life story, which his wife Susannah started writing more than 16 years 
ago.

After well over a 
decade of concerns about legal problems, the book — now being 
ghost-written by Yorkshire Post football correspondent Richard Sutcliffe
 — was said to have been almost finished last January.

But
 a year on, the final chapter dealing with Bates’s sale of Leeds to GFH 
Capital has not been completed and the 82-year-old is on holiday in 
South Africa.

Still waiting: Former Leeds owner Ken Bates' autobiography does not have a publication date as of yet

The MCC, who have a lot more than a lunatic fringe among their 18,000-strong membership, are facing a third call in three months for a debate to discuss governance and the botched Lord’s renovation process.

However, it doesn’t help the rebels’ credibility when ringleader and self-publicist Paddy Briggs, who had spent months campaigning for the last SGM, then went on holiday rather than attend the meeting.

It's good to know the FA protocol committee busy themselves with some of the great football issues of the day.

The latest minutes show that the blazers have been complaining about the sweet course in their VIP Wembley Suite meal being served at half-time rather than before the match because of time pressure before kick-off.

These ridiculous councillors have even asked for visiting international delegations to be reminded about the collar-and-tie dress code for their fancy function.

This follows Moldovan FA representatives turning up for the World Cup qualifier at Wembley in jeans and sweatshirts.

Some of the blazers are also aghast that their summer junket is now scheduled for every other year rather than being an annual event.

Ultra grey FA board duo Roger Burden and Michael Game are being blamed for cutting down on the partying.

Channel 5's judgment has to be called into question when sports agent Melissa Chappell, whose clients include Alan Shearer and Lee Dixon, receives a call from the inept TV station asking if the late Gary Speed would be available for interview on Tuesday.

The England bid document for the 2015 Rugby World Cup said there would be around 120 people working for the local organising committee by the start of the tournament.

However, ER 2015 now expect around 300 to be on the payroll in the build-up — with no doubt plenty of appointments coming from the ranks of LOCOG, who already dominate the rugby team. ER 2015 say 300 staff is in line with the numbers from New Zealand in 2011 and France 2007.
