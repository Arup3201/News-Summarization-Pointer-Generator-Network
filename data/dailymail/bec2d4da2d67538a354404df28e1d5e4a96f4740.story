A leading cancer specialist hospital is in crisis after staff made four major patient blunders in just six weeks.

Surgical items were left inside two patients, while a third case involved 'wrong site surgery' - where surgeons operated via an incorrect route into the body.

In a fourth error the wrong implant was fitted inside a patient.

Addenbrooke's Hospital: Four patients suffered due to staff blunders over the last six weeks. However none has come to 'permanent harm'

The multiple blunders at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridgeshire are known as 'never' events in the NHS because they are never supposed to happen.

A Cambridge University Hospitals 
spokesman said: 'We deeply regret these incidents and have apologised to
the four patients. Fortunately none of them came to any permanent harm.

The Cambridge hospital has 1,000 beds and 7,000 staff.

Between 2010 and 2011 there were 458,141 visits to outpatients and 115,844 day cases.

The hospital admitted 67,787 patients and dealt with 93,523 cases in A&E.

The hospital has an income of £577m and 33 operating theatres.

There are five intensive care units and 40 wards.            

'This hospital has one of the best 
records in the NHS for patient safety - but we are investigating and 
will learn from these events.

'We have already taken action to minimise the risk of them happening again.'

The spokesman added that no more information would be given due to patient confidentiality.

The medical director Dr Jag Ahluwalia 
sent an email to staff reminding them that the standard of patient 
safety should be '100 per cent.'

NHS chiefs will be holding an urgent meeting in the next few days to discuss why the events took place and how to prevent them happening in the future.

Peter Walsh from Action Against Medical Accidents, said: 'They aren't called 'never events' for nothing. There are basic safety checks in place to avoid this type of thing. There can be no excuse.'

Diane Abbott MP, the Shadow Public Health Minister, said: 'Andrew Lansley is so out of touch, he’s oblivious to the damage being done to the hospitals in his own constituency, let alone the rest of the country. 

'They have boasted about increasing NHS spending when in fact they have cut it in real terms.'

Addenbrooke's is an internationally renowned teaching hospital and is a leader in both neurological care and liver and bone marrow transplants.

The Cancer Research UK Cambridge Research Institute is based within the hospital complex.

The mistakes were 'never events' - as the NHS classes them as basic errors that should never take place
