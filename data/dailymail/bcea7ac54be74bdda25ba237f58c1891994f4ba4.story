The Voice judge Jessie J is famed for her fresh-faced glow, and now she has revealed her beauty secret.

In a tweet at 5pm on Wednesday she sent out a message saying: 'A lot of people often ask me what face cream I use.

'I have used Dior Rehydrating Mask everyday for 3 years! It's one of the few products I couldn’t live without.'

Following the post to her 6.5m followers divulging the secret to her flawless skin, Jessie J's army of fans were so desperate to emulate her look that stocks of the luxury beauty product sold out in minutes.

It's a sell out! After Jessie J tweeted about her love for the £25.90 Dior Hydra Life Beauty Awakening Mask, it immediately sold out online

With 289 retweets and 319 people 'favouriting' the tweet immediately there was an online shopping frenzy for the £25.90 moisturiser product and thousands of units were sold across the UK.

One online beauty retailer escentual.com sold out their stocks of Dior Hydra Life Beauty Awakening Mask within minutes and have had over 1,000 reservations for the product since it sold out and the product also sold out on feelunique.com.

A Escentual spokesman said: 'We could see something alarming was happening at just after 5pm.

'Normally we sell about a hundred units of this product in a month, but we had sold that amount in a matter of minutes.

'There were requests on email and we now have over 1,000 reservations for this product.

'Our social media team soon realised it was because Jessie J had tweeted about how this is her secret beauty product that she’s been using for the past three years.

'It just goes to show how strong her fan base is because this is a high-end luxury product but they still went out a bought it in large numbers.'

Beauty Editor Emma Leslie said: ‘Jessie certainly has picked an amazing product for keeping your skin looking radiant and youthful.

'The Dior Hydra Life Beauty Awakening Rehydrating Mask is a moisturiser that works with all skin types and is recommended for use once or twice a week.

Fresh: Jessie J told her fans she had been using the product on her skin for three whole years

'It should be applied to the skin for
 five to 10 minutes and then gently massaged into the pores in excess to
 make it penetrate deep into the derma.

'This will instantly infuse your skin with moisture, making it supple and glowing.'

While many celebrities act as ambassadors for beauty brands, Jessie isn't affiliated with Dior in any way.

Previous faces of Dior beauty include Natalie Portman, who has posed topless for the brand.

And Jessie J isn't the only famous face causing beauty sale booms.

Tulisa may have been partying non-stop in 
Marbella for the past few days but as she landed on British shores 
yesterday, everyone was quick to comment on her fresh-faced glow.

And now the secret behind her dewy visage has been revealed 
and
 it seems that women are rushing to emulate her look because sales of 
her beauty weapon have soared since she revealed it via Twitter.

Tulisa tweeted of her love for Skin Chemist's DD Cream, the first 'Daily Defence' cream to hit UK beauty market.

First came the BB cream followed by 
the CC, but now it's the DD cream taking centre stage, and Tulisa was 
lucky enough to trial it.

She immediately took to Twitter to 
complement the product writing: 'i love these !!! Thank you 
@TheJamesDean and @skinChemists xxx'.

The £95.95 cream immediately sold over 1,000 units in just a few hours as women rushed to emulate her look.

The DD cream is a moisturising solution that 
contains a range of anti-oxidants and SPF 20.

The brand, which is a firm favourite of 
model Jourdan Dunn, Tulisa, Amy Childs and Liam Payne's girlfriend 
Danielle Peazer, has also reported a huge surge in people searching for 
the term 'DD cream' across the web since Tulisa's tweet.

Tulisa is also a fan of their Wrinkle Killer Snake Serum, a £135 
potion that includes syn-ake - a neuro-peptide that mimics the effect of
 the Asian temple viper's venom.

In 2011 Tulisa was accused of cashing in on her role on the X Factor series by
 using her Twitter page to plug a dental firm that fitted her with free 
tooth veneers.

In an interview with the Radio 
Times the singer admitted she was given the treatment free of charge, 
adding: ‘It’s mental, the amount of free things I get offered.

‘There
 are things I work to afford and I don’t have to pay for them. It’s 
ridiculous. I could sell half the free things I have and be able to put a
 mortgage down on a house.’
