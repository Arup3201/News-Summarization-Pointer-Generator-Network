Andrea Plunket, 74, (pictured in 1994) is threatening the BBC with action following the success of its third Sherlock series

The BBC is facing a lawsuit from an elderly American heiress who claims she owns the rights to Sherlock Holmes.

Andrea Plunket, 74, is threatening the corporation with action following the success of its third Sherlock series.

The popular drama, featuring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman, attracted 8.8million viewers for its New Year's Day episode.

Ms Plunket, told the Express: 'I have the rights, that is clear. And I will be suing the BBC for Sherlock.

'They are not allowed to take a character and create a new story. The same goes for Elementary, the CBS TV adaption starring Jonny Lee Miller.

'I also have trademarks on the Holmes and Watson characters in Europe.'

One of Ms Plunket's four husbands was US producer Sheldon Reynolds.

Mr Reynolds made a Holmes TV series, and she says the rights were bought for £40,000 by her mother from Russian Princess Nina Mdivani.

Princess Nina was a sister-in-law of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's daughter, Dame Jean.

The Conan Doyle family say the rights simply passed down the family line.

Ms Plunket claims to have registered as her trademark all the leading characters in the Sherlock Holmes stories and accuses the BBC of breaching her trademark

In an interview with the Mail in September, Ms Plunket said she owned the 
copyright to the last ten stories from the Conan Doyle oeuvre in the 
U.S.

She also claimed to have registered as her trademark all 
the leading characters in the Sherlock Holmes stories and accuses the 
BBC of breaching her trademark.

She said: ‘No one has asked permission to 
use my trademarks and I am confident that if and when I go to court I 
will be able to prevent the BBC making any more Sherlocks. That is my wish.’

After Ms Plunket and Reynolds divorced in 1990, she fought a legal battle to maintain ownership of the copyrights.

MailOnline has contacted the BBC for comment.
