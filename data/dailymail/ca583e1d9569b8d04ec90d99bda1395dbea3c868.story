Police were called to the chambers of Canterbury Council on Tuesday evening after a meeting erupted into heated discussions following a decision by council members to remove the general manager from office.

Jim Montague, the 'king of Canterbury', came under fire recently when it was alleged that he had spent over $50,000 of taxpayers money at an Enfield restaurant, in Sydney's inner west, as part of the council's 'hospitality policy'. He denies the claims.

Police confirmed that officers from the Campsie local area command were called to council chambers to 'ensure and maintain order' when six of Canterbury's 10 councillors voted to remove Mr Montague despite the mayor adjourning the meeting.

The packed chamber became a hive of activity when Mayor Brian Robson, a close associate of Mr Montague and a regular lunch companion, declared that the meeting was adjourned, reported The Sydney Morning Herald.

He requested that the meeting be postponed until after the Independent Commission Against Corruption finalised their investigation into the allegations surrounding the matter, including Mr Montague's own claims against members of council.

Mr Montague has been accused of tallying up a $50,000 bill at Il Buco, in Enfield, including spending over $1000 on lunch and dinner in a single day.

The meals included a $105 bottle of wine, and an entree of king prawns and veal. 

Mr Montague denied the figures, and said that the bill had been rung up over a period of five years, rather than four.

Despite the Mr Montague and Mayor Robson walking out, the majority of councillors continued with their intention to vote, deciding on the spot to remove the general manager and appoint a new head of council.

Tensions arose when security guards were unsure whether they had authority to escort Mr Montague from his office, as Mayor Robson declared that the councillors action were illegal and that the general manager was still in authority. 

A spokesperson from the Campsie Police Station said that there had been no illegal activity and that no one had come to physical harm.

'The officers were called by an anonymous person to attend the chambers and were there as a precautionary measure only,' they said.

The meeting had been held in response to Mr Montague dismissing the selection of a planning chief for the council, despite a five-person panel, including Liberal councillor Michael Hawatt and Labor councillor Pierra Azzi, along with the mayor and general manager, selecting the candidate.

Mr Montague did not provide reasons for his decision, and councillors Azzi and Hawatt demanded the general meeting to push for the removal of him from office. 

Mr Montague, who has been the general manager of Canterbury Council for 30 years, maintained that his activity using taxpayer money was for council purposes.

'There were various people at Il Buco that we have been to see for various reasons,' he said.

'I understand the community's concerns and I apologise for this'.

Mayor Robson said that the meals were held to conduct council business, and that he would often take the chance to 'sit down and have a quiet lunch with the general manager on a Friday,' reported The Sydney Morning Herald.

'It is evident that council's hospitality policy is out of step with community expectations.'
