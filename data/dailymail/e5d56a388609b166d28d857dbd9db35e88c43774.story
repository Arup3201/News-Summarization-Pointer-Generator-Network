The full scale of violence and corruption in Libya since the fall of Colonel Gaddafi has been laid bare in an Amnesty International report accusing the world of 'turning a blind eye' to  war crimes.

Since the dictator's death in October 2011, the then Western-backed rebel groups have split into two  rival camps - one based on hardline Islamist ideology and the other a largely secular faction.

Amnesty has now accused both groups of 'running amok' and using armed gangs to torture and murder their rivals, saying the feuding militias have 'committed a wave of abductions targeting civilians based on their origins or perceived political allegiance'. 

The human rights organisation added that the international community is choosing to ignore the 'chaos engulfing Libya' however, saying the option to punish those responsible for potential crimes against humanity is available to the International Criminal Court, but has simply not been taken up.

Colonel Gaddafi died after the UN security council approved bombing raids led by Britain, France and the U.S. designed to assist rebel militias battling against forces loyal to Gaddafi on the ground.

He was eventually captured and shot dead by the victorious rebels in 2011.

But threat of extreme violence has remained near-constant presence in Libya since the civil war came to an end three years ago, as the once relatively united rebel militias struggle to find common ground on the extent to which  religion should play a role in rebuilding the country.

The deep ideological divisions have led to both sides committing human rights abuses in the subsequent battle for power, Amnesty International claims in its latest report.

'Armed groups have tortured - and probably summarily killed - detainees in their custody, and have committed a wave of abductions targeting civilians based on their origins or perceived political allegiance,' the report explains.

'Likewise, satellite images released today by Amnesty show that fighters on all sides in the conflict have displayed an utter disregard for civilian lives, launching indiscriminate rocket and artillery fire into crowded civilian neighbourhoods,' the human rights group added.

Amnesty cited specific accounts from Libyans caught up in the conflict - particularly in two cities key to the overthrow of Gaddafi in 2011, Misurata and Zintan.

While militia in Misurata are backed by Islamist groups linked to Ansar al-Sharia - the organisation accused of the killing of US ambassador Chris Stevens, fighters in Zintan are allied with the fledling Libyan regime, now based in the city of Tobruk.

Rebels from Misurata and other Islamist-dominated towns seized Libya's capital Tripoli in August, finally forcing divisions between the rival groups into open warfare.

The North African country has had two governments and parliaments since a militia group seized the capital, setting up its own cabinet and assembly.

Since then there have been accusations of tit-for-tat kidnappings in the areas around Misurata and Zintan - with detainees from either side saying they have been savagely beaten and tortured. 

Amnesty says photographs of corpses suggest a number of men taken captive were later murdered by the feuding militia, adding that others remain missing and are presumed dead.

Amnesty's report concludes that not enough is being done by the West to bring an end to the violence, adding that the option to punish those responsible for potential crimes against humanity is available to the International Criminal Court, but has simply not been taken up.

'The international community has largely turned a blind eye to the chaos engulfing Libya since the 2011 uprising,' the report claims.

A Foreign Office spokesman told the Telegraph that Britain remains committed to playing its part in Libya, and is helping to negotiate an 'essential' political settlement between the rival groups.

Western powers worry that the Libya is heading towards another civil war as authorities are too weak to control Islamists defying the state's authority in order to grab power and a share of oil revenues

This morning Libya's internationally-recognised Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni said he was ready for peace talks with Islamist groups controlling Tripoli,as fresh fighting in Benghazi killed 20 people. 

Thinni set one condition for talks with his rivals, however.

'We open the doors of dialogue with our brothers on the condition that there be concessions from all sides,' he told reporters in Khartoum at the end of a three-day visit to Sudan.

His comments were more conciliatory than recent statements when he had vowed to liberate Tripoli militarily, a plan analysts say is unrealistic as the weak government forces are no match for better-equipped rebels.
