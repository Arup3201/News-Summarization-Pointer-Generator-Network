The wife of severely ill radio legend Casey Kasem is desperate to become a reality TV star, the MailOnline can reveal.

Former actress Jean Kasem, 59 – who is currently at the centre of a bitter family feud over the care of her husband – wants to make a return to the lime-light.

The statuesque blonde had a small role in the 1984 hit movie Ghostbusters but is best known for playing the ditzy wife of Nick Tortelli on the hit '80s sitcom Cheers.

Returning tot he limelight: Jean Kasem, 59, had a small role in the 1984 hit movie Ghostbusters

Chtarring role: Jean is best known for playing the ditzy wife of Nick Tortelli on the hit 80s sitcom Cheers

It's war! The simmering battle between Jean Kasem, 59, left, and Kerri Kasem, one of Casey Kasem's three children with Linda Myers (pictured right with Kerri) has spilled out dramatically and publicly this week

Happier times: Court papers reveal how Kasem's three children from his previous marriage, Kerri, Michael and Julie were on good terms with Jean until his health deteriorated. But for seven years they have been fighting over who cares for him with Jean claiming they showed 'disturbing' behavior and want to secure his $80m

She has rarely been seen on television screens since - spending most of her time caring for 82-year-old husband Casey.

But a source told MailOnline: ‘Jean hasn’t been on TV for many years, she runs her own business and has invested a lot of time caring for her husband, but she’s keen to get back in the spotlight.

‘She’s spoken to producers about having her own reality show and I know she was desperate to get on the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.’

Last year Jean admitted her interest in starring in hit show RHOBH that is currently in its fourth season, and said she was in talks with producers at Bravo.

It was rumored she was being lined up to replace departed show stars Adrienne Maloof and Camille Grammar.

The move never transpired but sources say she is still keen to sign a deal for her own show.

Fame-seeking: MailOnline understands that Jean is desperate to join the cast of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills

New family: Kasem married Jean, a statuesque actress in 1980, a year after his divorce. They went on to have a daughter together, Liberty, pictured with them above. She is now 23 and firmly sides with her mother

'Wicked': Jean claims in court papers seen by MailOnline that she has unfairly been portrayed publicly as the villain in all their wrangling. She says the children have done nothing but 'disgrace' their father

Jean certainly has enough housewife credentials, she has been married to radio icon Casey since 1980.

The couple have a $10million home on the edge of Beverly Hills where she lives with her daughter, aspiring singer Liberty, 23.

Liberty is desperate to launch her singing career and would no doubt be keen to star in a reality show alongside her mom.

Her official website describes Liberty as a pop singer who performs in and around LA.

Her bio states her showbiz parents initially tried to dissuade her from pursuing a career in music but she began writing songs from a young age.

It adds: "Liberty is carrying on a proud tradition for an entirely new generation of radio listeners and fans."

Liberty is extremely close to her mom and just last week she pledged her undying love for Jean on Facebook.

In a passionate message posted on Mother's Day, Liberty wrote: 'Mom I love you your my best friend I would die without you! We are one!!!'

There’s certainly no doubt that a reality show starring the Kasem clan would be packed with drama.

Frail: Kasem (pictured here in 2009) has suffered terrible health problems. At first doctors thought he had Parkinson's and dementia. But now they have diagnosed him with Lewy body dementia that has left him unable to speak and bed-ridden for most of the time

Home help: Jean claims she was an excellent carer for Kasem while they lived at the mansion. While his children used to visit every Sunday, she says in court papers, she put a stop to them because of their behavior

Jean is currently at the center of a row over his husband’s health-care which last week sparked an international man-hunt for her frail husband who was reported missing.

Casey has since turned up on ‘vacation’ with his wife in Port Orchard, Washington.

But his older children from a previous marriage are furious that Jean took their dad away from the Berkley East Convalescent Hospital in Santa Monica where he was being cared for.

Casey was secretly moved without his gurney and all his medical equipment was gone. He suffers from Lewy body dementia, a progressive disease.

'Wildchild': Liberty, who describes herself as a singer/songwriter, has given Jean public support. On Mother's Day, she wrote: 'Together we stand together and we shall not fall!!!'

Upset: Jean says in court documents that Kerri, Julie and Michael have 
‘single-handedly and irreparably shattered the lives' of Kasem, Jean and Liberty (above) and have 'vilified their stepmother'

Money, money, money: Kerri dismisses Jean's claims that the children are after his money and control of his will. Kerri said: 'She's out of her mind. As I've said all along, we're 
not going to contest the will. She can take the house. We just want our dad back'

His daughters contacted the authorities and the media and claiming had been 'kidnapped' and was being 'hidden' by Jean.

But when police found the star they said he was 'cognizant' and did not appear in distress.

The MailOnline has also revealed how Jean and Casey’s children, Kerri, Julie and Mike are embroiled in a bitter seven year legal battle over Casey’s ongoing medical care.

Accusations that Casey was abused by his wife Jean have been hurled around.

His daughters branded her a ‘wicked’ step-mom, while Jean blames their ‘disturbing’ behavior for splitting the family up.

And shocking allegations of harassment and threats as well as lively street protests outside the family home have sparked endless rows.

Bad blood: In her submission to the court she makes her feelings known about Kerri's claim on her father's care. She writes harshly that they are the children from a 'prior marriage long ago'. Kasem is pictured here with his first wife Linda Myers and a child, thought to be Kerri

Glamor: Jean was an actress who had a small part in Ghostbusters and was a love interest on sit-com Cheers
