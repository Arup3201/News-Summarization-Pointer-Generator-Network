Stuart Broad has cast aside allegations of bullying in the England camp levied by ex-batsman Kevin Pietersen - and has decided to enjoy his autumn break instead.

The 28-year-old Nottinghamshire star posted a picture of himself on a Halloween-themed night out along with his girlfriend, Bealey Mitchell, and another female companion.

Broad and Mitchell were enjoying the musical battles on show at the Red Bull Culture Clash at London's Earl's Court on Thursday and he revealed he 'had such fun last night!'

It comes just days after he disputed Pietersen's claims, aired in the South African-born star's autobiography, that there was a culture of 'bullying' in the England dressing room - with Anderson and Broad cited as the leading offenders.

England travel to Sri Lanka for a one-day series at the end of November before beginning their preparations for the 2015 World Cup with matches against Australia and India in January.

Broad was a key part in England's revival in the second half of the summer, when under-pressure captain Alastair Cook led his side to a 3-1 comeback Test series victory over India.
