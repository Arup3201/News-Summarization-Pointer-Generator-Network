A jilted groom who passed out at his wedding only to  find his fiancee married to another when he came round two hours later has accused her of feeding him sweets laced with sedatives.

Jugal Kishore, 25, from Uttar Predesh province, India, claims bride Indiravati, 23, drugged him in order to marry her secret sweetheart and humiliate his family.

Mr Kishore says he was given a traditional sweet made of betel leaves when he arrived at the ceremony ten days ago, after which he started feeling woozy.

He said: 'I'd not eaten all day either, so I felt uneasy on my feet and I just hit the floor.'

Having just made the 370-mile journey from his village to the celebration he was immediately rushed off to hospital.

When he  regained consciousness two hours later he went back to the wedding venue to continue the rituals, but Indiravati was married to Harpal Singh, a member of her brother-in-law's family.

Mr Singh claimed he was caught off guard as he was only wearing jeans and a leather jacket at the time, but agreed to go ahead with the wedding anyway.

Mr Kishore added: 'I was helpless. The wedding was already over and she was no more mine. 

'I had to return home without my wife. I can never forgive her for this embarrassment.'

His elder brother Ravi Kumar, 34, believes the whole wedding was a farce and it was a conspiracy to insult the family.

He said: 'My brother is perfectly healthy. He's never suffered any seizures. In fact the doctor said he was anxious and had a high blood pressure and that's why he lost consciousness. 

'He sent him home with no concerns and told him to eat some food. It's shocking that no one from the bride's family joined us at the hospital. They seemed totally unfazed.'

Mr Kishore claims Indiravati's relatives became aggressive when he went back to the wedding venue.

He said: 'After I returned from the hospital, a crowd of nearly 250 people surrounded my family. They threatened us and told us to pay Rs 50,000 (£520) for the wedding.

'My family pleaded with them to be reasonable but they did not budge.'

However, Indiravati's family say Mr Singh had an epileptic seizure at the altar, and angry that they had not been informed of his health issues, they married her off to someone else instead.

Indiravati's younger brother Suraj, 18, has also accused Mr Kishore of being drunk and said his sister called off the wedding because she didn't want to 'marry an alcoholic'.

'We never said he'd suffered an epileptic seizure and we did not give him any sweets laced with sedatives,' her brother said. 'These stories are getting out of control.'

'The wedding was going well and everything was fine until the wedding garlands were exchanged and then he started throwing up. He was shivering and was not in his senses. 

'This is when my sister and family decided to call off the wedding as we were confident that he was an alcoholic and perhaps a sick man.

'We didn't go to the hospital with him because we were very angry with them for hiding his drinking habit. 

'My sister confirmed she no longer wanted to marry Jugal, so the whole family stood by her decision.

'My sister did know her now husband but they were never friends before hand. 

'Harpal is my brother-in-law's younger brother and is a wonderful man. When my sister asked him if he would marry her, he said yes immediately. He is a gem of a person.'  

Mr Kishore added: 'I cannot believe she has spread these rumours about me having a seizure to marry an old friend.

'I am finding it really hard to comprehend how a young guy would quickly agree to a wedding? I am certain they already knew each other and it was all planned.'

'I don't have a history of seizures. I don't suffer with epilepsy. 

'I have no idea where they've got that information from, it's ridiculous and totally untrue. They're just making up stories and protecting themselves.' 

Mr Kishore and his relatives filed a report with police, but eventually withdrew the case after elders intervened and begged them to reconsider.

Police Chief Ram Khiladi Solanki said: 'Ravi Kumar came to us with a complaint but before we could intervene the bride's family arrived at the station and compromised the matter. 

'Both families have amicably resolved the situation and the complaints have now been withdrawn.'

The jilted groom added: 'We thought it is better to move on. Now that she is married there's not much I can do about it anyway. 

'But I cannot forgive her ever for what she has done to me. It's been very embarrassing.'
