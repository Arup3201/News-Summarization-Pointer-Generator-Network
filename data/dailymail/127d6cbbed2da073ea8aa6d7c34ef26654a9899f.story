England's tour of South Africa next winter will last 72 days, with the England and Wales Cricket Board releasing the schedule on Monday.

The tour, which will be made up of four Tests, five one-day internationals and two Twenty20s, spans December, January and February 2015-16.

England are due to arrive in South Africa on December 11 and anyone who remains until the final T20 on February 21 will have gone the 72-day distance. 

Captain Alastair Cook set to lead England squad on a 72-day tour of South Africa next year

'Any tour of South Africa is special and as the Proteas currently set the benchmark in Test and ODI cricket it will be a real challenge which our emerging team will relish,' managing director Paul Downton said.

'We can be assured of fantastic support in South Africa from the thousands of loyal supporters who always follow us around the country - particularly at the Boxing Day Test in Durban and the New Year Test at Newlands in Cape Town.'

England will have two long-form warm-up matches against invitational sides before the first Test in Durban which starts on Boxing Day.

After that Tests will take in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Centurion before one-day cricket comes to the fore.

Fifty-over clashes will be held in Bloemfontein, Port Elizabeth, Centurion, Johannesburg and Cape Town, before T20s in Cape Town and Johannesburg.
