A pensioner had the shock of her life when she picked up her post to find a tax demand - for more than £16 MILLION.

Enid Fisher, 73, was staggered to hear she had multi-million pound debts after being in dispute with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) over an amount of just £432.

When Enid discovered they had ordered her to pay £16,022,012, she said: '  I couldn't believe it - I even swore out loud. I thought "Good Lord, what is this?"'

Tax bill: The letter from HMRC which claimed Enid Fisher owed £16 million in tax

The original demand came in February and she thought she had cleared up the matter after the tax office admitted a mistake and paid her a £904 rebate.

Enid, from Long Marton, Cumbria, said: 'My husband Donald said I should just pay it to get them off my back, but I said 'no' -  I knew I didn't owe them anything.'

Determined, Enid wrote to the HMRC, who wrote back, and a correspondence began.

She said: 'There were lots of letters and phone calls backwards and forwards.

'The tax people wouldn't have it but I proved them wrong and they actually owed me £904.'

Enid believed her fight was over when the rebate was finally paid into her account at the end of May.

After Enid pointed out their mistake, HMRC apologised to her - explaining that someone had put the date February 16, 2012 into the wrong box. They also gave the pensioner £200 in compensation.

Enid said: 'I still work three days a week, but there are some women at work not as old as me who said they would have panicked.

'I've got a pile of tax letters now - I think I'll frame the £16 million one.'

A spokeswoman for HMRC said: 'We are unable to discuss the details of individual taxpayers due to restrictions on confidentiality, however we have apologised to Ms Fisher for any distress caused and understand the matter has been now resolved.'
