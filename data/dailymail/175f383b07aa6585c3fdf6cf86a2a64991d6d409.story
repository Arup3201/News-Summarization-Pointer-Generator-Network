A farmer who pocketed more than £100,000 in benefits after claiming he couldn't walk 10 metres unaided was caught on camera herding cattle and climbing over fences.

David Millward was secretly filmed walking freely and carrying bags of animal feed around the field he rented in Coven, Staffordshire.

He was also spotted climbing over a fence,
filling feeding trays and loading cattle into his trailer. He walked 
without any aids and only displayed a slight limp.

This is despite illegally 
pocketing £75,532 in income support and £24,692 in disability living 
allowance.

summer.
