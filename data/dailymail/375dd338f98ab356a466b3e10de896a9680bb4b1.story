Prince Charles has visited the scene of the Scottish helicopter crash - where he received a hug from the eight-year-old granddaughter of a survivor.

The Prince met some of the emergency workers who had taken part in the rescue operation at the Clutha bar in Glasgow today.

He also spoke to a number of crash survivors, council workers and hospital staff.

His visit comes a week after a police helicopter plunged into the roof of the busy pub - killing nine people and injuring a further 32 pub-goers.

Among the fatalities were the doomed 
aircraft's crew members - David Traill, 51, and police 
officers Kirsty Nelis, 36, and Tony Collins, 43.

Six pub-goers were also killed when the helicopter struck, including Robert Jenkins, 61, Mark O'Prey, 44, Colin Gibson, 33, John 
McGarrigle, 57, Gary Arthur, 48, and Samuel McGhee, 56.

Today, the Prince of Wales - known as the Duke of Rothesay in Scotland - spent around 10 minutes looking around the destroyed venue, before meeting a number of crash survivors.

He also spoke about the tragedy with Police Scotland's chief constable Sir Stephen House, Scottish Fire and Rescue's chief officer Alasdair Hay, 
and Scottish Ambulance Service's chief executive Pauline Howie.

Among the survivor he met was Ann Faulds, who had been on a night out in the Clutha bar with her sister when the helicopter hit.

Ms Faulds was accompanied by her granddaughter Megan Faulds, eight, who couldn't restrain herself from hugging the Prince.

Ms Faulds said the
Quarry Brae Primary School pupil had wanted to ask about Prince Charles about his grandson 
Prince George - however, she had lost her words on meeting the Royal.

During the visit, Prince Charles also met Calum Grierson and John Robson, who had been in the pub with six friends when the aircraft struck last Friday. 

Mr Grierson, 59, from Hamilton, Lanarkshire, said: '[The Prince] was interested to hear how we were progressing. He was very genuine and it was a pleasure to meet him.'

Reflecting on the tragedy, Mr Grierson said he had been lucky Clutha bar owner Alan Crossan had pulled him and others from the wreckage.

Walking
with a stick and with a cut and bruise on his head, he said: 'Our feet 
were stuck. We couldn't get out ourselves. If Alan hadn't got us out ...
he didn't think twice about coming back in.

Mr Robson, 62, from Glasgow, added: 'I thought a bomb had gone off. It just went black. It was terrifying.'

Hundreds of floral tributes have been left at the Clutha bar, which the helicopter plunged into while returning from a police operation.

Meeting: The Prince spoke with council staff including social workers, resilience crews and others who helped in the aftermath of the tragedy

The pub now sits behind a large police cordon - with more than a dozen bags of rubble and a large pile of wooden planks surrounding it.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg visited the pub earlier this week - and flowers have been left outside the venue by Glasgow-born comedian and actor Billy 
Connolly, Celtic manager Neil Lennon and Rangers manager Ally McCoist.

Pub owner Mr Crossan said he had 'appreciated' Prince Charles's visit today.

'It is a special thing for people who have been affected and for the emergency services, who did an incredible job,' he said.

Prince Charles later met about 40 health workers who were involved in the immediate response to the helicopter crash.

He greeted a range of nurses, doctors and other clinical staff at Glasgow Royal Infirmary - one of several hospitals that treated more than 30 pub-goers in the wake of the tragedy.

Today, six patients remain in the Royal Infirmary, while a further four are still being treated at Southern General General Hospital.

Leaving the Royal Infirmary after just over
half an hour, the Prince said to all the gathered staff: 'Well done 
everybody, I'm very proud of you.'

Speaking
after the visit, Andrew Robertson, chairman of the health board, said: 'It's a great boost for everybody. It's recognition of the special 
effort over and above the call of duty.

'He was clearly showing appreciation and a great humanity. He was brilliant, he engaged with every single person here.'

Mr Robertson also expressed his own 'huge appreciation' for the work of the health board staff.

'It's
a great privilege to be head of an organisation where there is just 
such professionalism, such skill, such resilience and real compassion,' 
he said.

This afternoon, Prince Charles met privately with relatives of those who 
had lost their lives in the crash.

Christmas greetings: He later met members of the public who had gathered in George Square to see him, before wishing them a Merry Christmas

He also signed a book of condolences at the City Chambers - simply writing 'Charles' and the date.

During
the visit, he spoke with council staff including social workers, 
resilience crews and others who helped in the aftermath of the tragedy.

On
leaving, he shook hands with members of the public, who had gathered in George 
Square to see the Prince, before wishing them a Merry Christmas.

Glasgow
Lord Provost Sadie Docherty said: 'For me, him coming here today was a 
mark of the respect that he has for the city and for those who lost 
their lives.

'He spoke to members of the emergency services, with council staff and with those who lost loved ones.

'It's very appreciated by the city, a city that is grieving.'

Air crash investigators are now examining the wreckage of the helicopter crash.
