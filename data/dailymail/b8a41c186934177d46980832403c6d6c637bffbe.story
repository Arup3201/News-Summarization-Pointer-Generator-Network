They are the bits of tournament television coverage we love to watch but which we also dread, and in the battle of the World Cup 2014 montages BBC just shaded it over ITV.

We all enjoy seeing the best bits of a tournament sped up and condensed into just a few minutes but with those montages comes the reality that the greatest football show on earth has come to a close.

Brazil 2014 will be remembered for the goals, the utter humiliation of the hosts at the hands of Germany in the semi-finals, England's disastrous performance, as well as Luis Suarez's bite on Giorgio Chiellini.

Fun in the sun: ITV's montage was shorter so raced more quickly through the action

Poster boy: BBC's montage was double the length of ITV's and heavily featured Brazilian Neymar

Looking to the sky: BBC capture the moment Mario Gotze won the World Cup final for Germany

Joy: ITV's captured the moment by showing Gotze running off and beaming with delight

 

 

BBC:

Peak - 16.7million

Average - 12.1million

ITV:

Peak - 3.9million

Average - 2.8million 

BBC's montage was more than double the length at four minutes and 51 seconds, while ITV's was just two minutes 18 seconds.

Although this allowed the BBC to include more action, their package also involves a lot of dancing and pieces contributed by actors. This adds to the intrigue but it also takes away slightly from the best moments of the tournament - it takes one minute 15 seconds before any goals are shown.

ITV on the other hand just head straight into the action from the off and show all of the goals and tournament best moments one after another. They also include some of the funniest studio moments which the BBC largely omit from their offering. 

Overall, the BBC's montage depicts more accurately the story of how the tournament progressed and, although it is a tad long, it just comes out on top.

The Beeb also unsurprisingly smashed ITV in the World Cup final viewing figures war.

A staggering 16.7million people tuned into to watch Germany beat Argentina 1-0 after extra time on the BBC at their peak, whereas just 3.9m opted for ITV's coverage from the Maracana Stadium.
