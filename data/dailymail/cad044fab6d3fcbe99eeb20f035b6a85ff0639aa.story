QPR chairman Tony Fernandes has suggested that Chris Ramsey is on a three-month audition to prove he has the credentials to manage the club on a long-term basis.

The former youth coach was appointed R's boss until the end of the season earlier this week following the resignation of Harry Redknapp.

Ramsey was put in caretaker charge as Fernandes began the search for a new permanent manager with former Tottenham head coach Tim Sherwood and Michael Laudrup heavily linked with the post.

But after impressing the chairman during his short spell in charge, including earning the west London club's first away points of the season with the midweek win against Sunderland, Fernandes has decided to place his faith in the rookie for the remainder of the campaign.

The daunting task facing the 52-year-old is to steer QPR to Premier League safety and Fernandes says that Ramsey has an opportunity to secure the job on a more permanent basis.

'There are no guarantees in football. But Chris Ramsey has every chance to build a long term and huge managerial future at QPR. We are lucky,' Tony Fernandes tweeted on Saturday morning.

'We found a great guy to manage us from next season, a dream manager, but actually we had a dream candidate right in front of us Chris Ramsey.'

'So we the board decided to give Chris a chance and he certainly has been a dream in such a short period. First away win. Happy players.

'He almost works 24hrs. After first team he takes eds and even under 14. He's modest, gets on with the job is organised, passionate and loyal.'

QPR chairman Tony Fernandes will appoint Chris Ramsey as Rangers boss until the end of the season.

Here Sportsmail look at five key issues he needs to address to ensure they beat the drop.

AWAY FORM

Despite picking up their first win on the road against Sunderland last time out, the previous 11 matches did not yield a single point for Rangers. With Arsenal, Tottenham and Chelsea still to come to Loftus Road, their away form could be the key to ensuring their Premier League survival.

LEAKY DEFENCE

Rangers have the joint worst defensive record in the league and, with goals also at a premium, tightening up at the back is a must. Harry Redknapp failed to identify his preferred central defensive partnership so finding a system that gets the best out of Rio Ferdinand and Steven Caulker could make the difference.

SHARE THE GOALS

Charlie Austin has contributed 50 per cent of QPR's goals in the Premier League and that form has rightly led to talk of a potential England call-up. But Ramsey will be looking for someone else to help shoulder the scoring burden, especially with the former Burnley man not having scored in open play since the December win over West Brom.

CALM JOEY BARTON DOWN

This may be easier said than done, with the combative midfielder becoming the first player in Premier League history to be cautioned in seven consecutive matches. Barton's leadership qualities and never-say-die attitude are far more beneficial on the field than off it, so avoiding suspensions is crucial.

INTEGRATE A SQUAD OF EGOS

Barton, Adel Taarabt, Ferdinand. None of the three are afraid to speak their minds and they are not the only squad members with chequered pasts. Sandro and Mauro Zarate have also had high-profile disagreements with managers and Ramsey will need to forge a team ethos to stand any chance of survival.
