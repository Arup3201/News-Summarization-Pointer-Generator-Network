Prosecutors in Genoa have placed the captain of the Jolly Nero cargo ship under investigation for alleged manslaughter after the vessel slammed into the dock at the busy port and toppled the control tower into the harbor, killing at least seven people.

Prosecutor Michele de Lecce today said the harbour pilot on the ship's bridge at the time of the crash was also placed under investigation. Such investigations are par for the course in Italy.

Transport Minister Maurizio Lupi told 
Parliament that given the 'perfect' weather conditions last night, 
possible causes of the crash could include an engine malfunction or 
problems with the cables between the container ship and the tugs guiding
it.

He said investigators were also looking into possible mistakes with the manoeuvre itself.

A massive rescue operation was ongoing today in north western city of Genoa after the 40,000 tonne Jolly Nero smashed into the tower at around 11pm last night.

Four people have been taken to hospital and two more remain unaccounted for following the disaster.

By this morning, all that was left of 
the tower was its mangled exterior staircase, tilted on its side. The 
tower itself - which was located on the edge of a dock jutting out into 
the harbor - was either in the water or in a heap of rubble and steel on
the dock.

Luca Cari, spokesman for the fire rescue teams at the scene, confirmed the seven dead, saying rescue crews recovered several of the bodies from an area near the tower's submerged elevator.

There were fears that those still missing might be trapped inside the elevator, Cari said. There were no reports of missing ship crew.

'This event is unbelievable because 
we had the best weather navigation conditions,' said Luigi Merlo, 
president of the Genoa port authority. He declined to speculate on a 
cause, saying the ship had plenty of room to maneuver in the harbor and 
shouldn't have ended up so close to the dock.

One theory prosecutors were 
considering was that a possible mechanical failure aboard the ship left 
the captain unable to steer it properly, Italian news reports said, 
citing prosecutor Michele de Lecce.

Mauro described the ship, the Jolly 
Nero of the Ignazio Messina & C. SpA Italian shipping line, as 
somewhat unique in its height, so that the full weight of the ship 
slammed 'violently' into the tower itself, not just the dock.

'The ship directly impacted the control tower,' he told Sky TG24.

The Genoa-based Messina Line has a 
fleet of 14 cargo ships, with the Italian-flagged Jolly Nero listed at 
239 meters (784 feet) long and 30 meters (98 feet) wide, according to 
its website.

The five bodies recovered included 
three coast guard officials in the tower at the time of the crash, a 
port captain and a tugboat operator, said Cmdr. Filippo Marini, a coast 
guard spokesman. The bodies of the other two dead were being recovered, 
he said.

In a statement, Messina said it was 
fully cooperating with authorities to determine the cause of the 
'tragic' accident, which it said occurred during a normal maneuver to 
leave the port. It said Messina Line ships do the maneuver with 
regularity and are always accompanied by tugboats.

'There aren't words to express the 
dismay and profound condolences for the victims of this tragedy and 
their families,' Messina said in a statement.

Andrea Furgani, an ambulance doctor and one of the first rescuers, said crews brought four injured to hospitals in Genoa.

'The conditions were critical. They 
mainly suffered wounds caused by compression, broken bones and wounds on
the chest,' he told the Associated Press.

The disaster shook a nation that just
a year ago witnessed another shipping tragedy when the Costa Concordia 
cruise ship slammed into a reef off Tuscany on Jan. 13, 2012, killing 32
people.

Parliament held a minute of silence today for the victims in Genoa, the mayor of Genoa proclaimed a 
period of mourning and Italian President Giorgio Napolitano sent his 
condolences to the victims' families on behalf of the nation.

Genoa's port, located on Italy's 
western Ligurian coast, is Italy's busiest in terms of cargo handling, 
according to the port authority website. It is also a major port of call
for cruise ships sailing the Mediterranean.
