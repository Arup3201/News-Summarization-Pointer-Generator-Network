Dominic Raiola, who plays for the Detroit Lions, has been accused of screaming profanities and homophobic insults at a university marching band

Raiola is also accused of shouting insults about the musicians' weights and sexuality.

One band member Zach York posted publicly on his Facebook page: 'Dominic Raiola is literally the worst person I have ever had the fortune to encounter.

Zach York, who plays in the University of Wisconsin Marching Band, dubbed Raiola 'the worst person I have ever had the fortune to encounter'

'After marching down the field awaiting the national anthem, He went off on a verbal tirade, among other things, questioning my sexuality (as a band member) and then continued on to bring my sister and my recently deceased mother into the conversation.

'After I refused to give him the satisfaction of turning to look at him, he switched targets to a trombone ranting at him calling him overweight and saying he can't play a real sport.

'After our halftime show, the same fine gentleman called a female member of the band the "c" word.'

The Detroit Lions apologized for the player and said that they would respond further once they had investigated.

A spokesman for the University of Wisconsin-Madison told fox11:
'Special opportunities such as playing before a Packers game are 
highlights for our band members: something they look forward to, and 
that we hope they will remember with pride.

'We are proud of 
the way members of the UW Band have brought this matter to our 
attention, and how they kept their focus on providing a great experience
for the fans at Lambeau Field.'

Raiola's brother Donovan once attended UW-Madison, the school that the marching band belongs to.

The Wisconsin band typically performs at one Packers game each season. 

Raiola, 34, is originally from Hawaii and played college football in Nebraska. He has three children with his wife Yvonne. The couple are high school sweethearts. 

The football player allegedly fathered a son out of wedlock in 2007. Last year he was sued by former girlfriend Andrea Yee after he allegedly stopped paying child support.
