They are as British as a stiff upper lip, however knee socks have fallen out of favour with the nation’s men.

Generations of boys in short trousers welcomed the warmth and protection of knee-high grey socks during the long winter trudge to school.

They were also an essential part of the kit for the nation’s military, whether it was surviving the trenches, negotiating the jungles of Burma or crewing a Royal Navy ship through the South Atlantic.

Long woolen socks are a thing of the past. Ankle socks are more popular and fashionable. Debenhams is planning to cut its range of long socks by half due to poor sales

However, today’s molly-coddled youth and young men, now mostly rely on the flimsy, throw-away white socks worn with designer trainers.

Many a fashionable young man will now go without socks completely, apparently happy to show a bit of bare ankle above a smart pair of brogues.

The office uniform for most white collar workers is a pair or dark – black, blue or grey - ankle socks

Debenhams said it plans to halve its range of knee length socks this Autumn after seeing a 74per cent slump in sales over the past two years.

Spokesman Ed Watson said: ‘A garment which once symbolised Britain’s imperial might is marching into history, bringing an end to a century long role of traditional male dress.

‘Instead, modern men are opting for ankle socks, ultra short sport socks, or in high fashion circles; no socks at all.’

He complained: ‘The common phrase ‘pull your socks up’ could mean nothing to future generations. Knee length socks once conquered an empire, but now they seem to be fading into history.’

Long woollen knee high socks were once standard issue for both the British army and the navy.

They were regarded as essential to protect soldiers in the trenches, helping to prevent foot rot which maimed so many troops during World War One.

Officers had socks made of a softer, finer weave, while other ranks made do with coarser material.

Thousands of women across the country knitted long socks to send to the troops during both world wars.

So vital a part of life were they, that the Imperial War Museum still has a collection of knee high socks worn by British military personnel throughout various campaigns.

Cold weather was by no means the only reason to wear them, for long socks were worn with shorts by the British army in tropical climates, such as India and Burma.

Many former British overseas territories continue to wear the style today - police in Bermuda still wear long socks as part of their regular summer uniform.

The practice of wearing long socks continued into British civilian life when millions of troops were demobilised after World War II.

Many were worn with discreet calf garters to prevent them from slipping down the leg.

However, Debenhams said the introduction of central heating and the more comfortable lifestyles of modern Britain mean demand for knee-high socks has been in decline since the 1960s.

It said the desire of a new generation to be different from their parents in the 1970s and 1980s saw the sock fall further in popularity.

The store said that modern lightweight shoes have also made wearing thick woollen socks impractical and uncomfortable.

Mr Watson said: ‘While there are still some men who refuse to part with tradition, knee high socks are now worn primarily by school children and Swiss yodelling champions.

‘It’s a shame because these socks served the country well when Britain was on its back foot. Now it seems that we have become a nation, quite literally, in danger of losing its sole.’
