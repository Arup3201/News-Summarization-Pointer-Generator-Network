West Ham striker Carlton Cole has spoken of his disappointment at being fined £20,000 for a Twitter indiscretion in which he told a Tottenham fan to 'F off you c***'.

The 31-year-old, who has 123,000 followers on Twitter, was responding to a message from Spurs supporter Stuart Hardy that read: 'Hi @CarltonCole1 when your own team-mates don't kick the ball out when you're lying injured for 2 mins, you think it's time to call it a day?' 

Cole accepted the fine from the FA, dished out after the incident that occurred on February 22, but has now spoken out to defend himself.

Carlton Cole is far from the first footballer to have be censured over his behaviour on Twitter:

Darren Bent, 2009 - £120,000 fine

Bent was fined by his club Tottenham for a blast at chairman Daniel Levy. He tweeted: ‘Do I wanna go Hull City NO. Do I wanna go Stoke NO do I wanna go Sunderland YES so stop f****** around levy.’ 

Carlton Cole, 2011 - £20,000 fine

Cole tweeted during England's friendly with Ghana saying: 'Immigration has surrounded the Wembley premises! I knew it was a trap!'

Rio Ferdinand, 2012 - £45,000 fine

Ferdinand appeared to endorse a tweet by another user  which described  Ashley Cole as a 'choc ice', a term said to mean a person is black on the outside but white on the inside.

Cole was unimpressed with the FA's judgement in the John Terry racism case, tweeting: 'Hahahahaa, well done #fa I lied did I, #BUNCHOFT***S'

Michael Chopra, 2014 - £15,000 fine

Referring to life at crisis club Blackpool, Chopra posted: ‘F****** joke this come in training only 6 f****** players here then find out the fitness coach taken the football session #joke.’ 

Rio Ferdinand, 2014 - three-match ban and £25,000 fine

QPR defender used the word 'sket' in reference to another Twitter user's mother this season.

'I was disappointed I got done,' the West Ham man told Sky Sports' Goals on Sunday.

'The amount of abuse you get on Twitter is sometimes unruly and you can't defend yourself as a footballer.

'Obviously I know I've got responsibility and I'm a role model and some of the language that gets spouted at you, you can't return it. You've got to be very aware of that and I did make a mistake.'

It is not the first time Cole has been caught out by the FA. He was fined £20,000 in April 2011 for a tweet he posted during England's friendly against Ghana that read: 'Immigration has surrounded the Wembley premises! I knew it was a trap!

'The only way to get out safely is to wear an England jersey and paint your face w/ the St George's flag!' 

After his second misdemeanor in February, Cole's total fines for Twitter wrongdoings rose to £40,000, an amount he admits 'hurts'. 

'You can't defend yourself,' he continued. 'You're a sitting duck really and you need to try and be able to blank it out of your mind – but some of the stuff they say is too much.

'If you can't handle it you should stay off Twitter or else you're going to be getting fined a lot.

'Forty grand hurts! I try to keep it humorous on Twitter, but sometimes being humorous does get you into trouble.' 

After his tweet to the Tottenham supporter, the FA's statement, detailing the fine, read: 'Following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing today, Carlton Cole has been fined £20,000 after he admitted breaching FA Rules in relation to social media.'

'The West Ham United player, who was also severely warned as to his future conduct, admitted posting a comment on his Twitter account which was abusive and/or insulting and/or improper and/or brought the game into disrepute, in breach of FA Rule E3.' 

Cole has been fined £40,000 overall for two separate incidents involving his Twitter conduct
