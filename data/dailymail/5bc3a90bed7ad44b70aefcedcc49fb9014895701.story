An incompetent sailor dubbed Captain Calamity has been arrested by police after coastguards were called to rescue him at sea for the 10th time in a month.

A concerned member of the public had called emergency services after seeing Tim Freeman, 24, standing in the surf at Studland, Dorset, struggling to control his 24ft yacht with a rope.

By the time help arrived Mr Freeman had left the area, but he was found soon afterwards and taken into custody in connection with allegedly failing to attend court over an assault charge.

Residents living along the south coast hope his detention will bring some respite to coastguard and lifeboat crews after Mr Freeman’s calamitous solo voyages ended in him being rescued nine times at a cost of more than £20,000.

Captain Calamity: Tim Freeman, 24, has now sparked 10 sea rescues in a month at a cost of more than £20,000

The incident began yesterday after 
Freeman set sail from Wareham in Dorset and then ran aground at nearby 
Studland Knol, prompting a passer-by to raise the alarm.

A coastguard spokesman said: 'When 
Swanage coastguards arrived he was not there, but the police received 
another call about the man in a different area and put two and two 
together.

'Obviously we are glad that he is safe and hopefully this will mean fewer incidents of this kind.

'We can use our time and resources now on other incidents and don’t want him to get into any more trouble.'

Freeman was arrested on behalf of 
Warwickshire Police in connection with allegedly failing to attend a 
previous court appearance in Leamington Spa to answer charges of 
assault.

Incident: The sailor's first yacht, run aground at Littlehampton beach, but after it was seized he got a new one

Tim Freeman's 21ft yacht was 
impounded after five incidents off West Sussex in early September, but 
undeterred he just got a new one, which he has now lost control of on four more occasions.

The 24-year-old rivals Britain's worst sailor Glenn Crawley, who was nicknamed Captain Calamity after being rescued by the RNLI 15 times in a decade off the coast of Cornwall.

Mr Freeman's troubles started in the first week of September, when he repeatedly ran aground or got lost off the south coast.

On one occasion he had to swim to safety when his yacht developed a hole in the hull and was in danger of sinking. It was later seized by The Maritime and Coastguard Agency.

But he then got a new 24ft boat, before getting into trouble four times in the past four days.

His nine emergency callouts by lifeboat and harbour master crews has cost more than £20,000, as every call out costs £2,500.

Mr Freeman first came to the coastguards' attention earlier this month when he was rescued five times in a week at locations between Seaford, East Sussex, and Littlehampton, West Sussex.

Billy Johnson, the Littlehampton Harbour Master, said: 'He caused problems along the coast by grounding his yacht or running it up the beach.

'On the last occasion the yacht was towed into Littlehampton it was impounded by the MCA and lifted out because it was holed and was going to sink.

'The also grounded it on the grounds of crew competency. To get his boat released from detention he had to fix the damage and obtain some training.

'But he just left without talking to us and the boat is still here.

'He has demonstrated a lack of competence and is a drain on resources.

'The idea of him getting out in the English Channel doesn't bear thinking about.'

After getting a new boat, he got into trouble again on four occasions since last Thursday.

The Sidmouth lifeboat in Devon was called out after concerned members of the public observed him try to run the new boat, called Reginald, up the beach to get ashore.

He then sailed to Swanage, Dorset, where the local lifeboat had to be scrambled when the yacht was seen to drift dangerously close to the shoreline.

Officers tried to assist Mr Freeman who rejected the offer and managed to attach the craft to a mooring buoy, with the boat facing the wrong way.

Two days later the lifeboat was called again after the same sailor got a rope caught around his propeller off Swanage.

The volunteer crew decided to escort the solo sailor, who has no navigational charts, into nearby Poole Harbour only for him to get lost soon after they left his side.

Mr Freeman was intending to moor at Wareham Quay but steered down the wrong channel of water and ended up running aground again.

He dialled 999 and a jet-skier managed to tow him free before pointing him in the right direction. The Poole Harbour Master boat then towed the troubled yacht into Wareham yesterday.

Coastguards are now closely watching Mr Freeman's next move but are urging him to stay on land and not go to sea again.

Roz Evans, watch manager at Portland coastguard, said: 'Our enforcement officers are watching the situation.

'We wish he would moor up for a while and get the right equipment and training, like navigational charts.

'He knows how to call for help, that's for sure.

'His situation has been a daily issue for us now and we have been monitoring him since he turned up at Sidmouth last week.

'Our concern is that he is going to come to harm sooner or later and that he is taking up far too much of our time and resources.'

Mr Freeman has claimed that he has undertaken sailing lessons in Plymouth since his first boat was impounded in Littlehampton but would not comment further.

A spokesman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: 'Portland coastguard have coordinated four incidents involving the same vessel off the Devon and Dorset coast since last Thursday.

'Incidents have included grounding a vessel and issues with navigation.

'We have provided the skipper with guidance about maritime safety - and are willing to discuss this further with him.

'We respond to all emergency calls, deploying appropriate search and rescue resources.

'We recommend that people undertake training for leisure boat activities, as they will be far less likely to be involved in a maritime accident.'
