Experts may be concerned that a faulty thruster on the Philae lander could potentially scupper the Rosetta mission, but its lead scientist is so confident of success that he already has the triumphant moment of landing tattooed on his leg.

British scientist Dr Matt Taylor is one of the most important people involved in the European Space Agency's mission to land on a comet for the first time and has become a Twitter sensation.

The Rosetta Project Scientist has caused a stir on the social network because of his unorthodox appearance, involving bright shirts and an array of body art - including a tattoo on his leg of the space probe landing on the comet, which he got in January.

Dr Taylor, from north east London, is so positive that the mission to land on the comet will be successful that he has already had the moment permanently etched on his body.

He told BBC Breakfast: ‘I'm incredibly confident that we're going to nail this landing. I'm confident enough to have it drawn on my body.’

As he showed off the design on his right thigh, Dr Taylor said: ‘That's my prediction for later today, that we get the lander on the comet.’

Earlier this morning, Esa's Rosetta probe released its Philae lander to attempt the first ever landing of a spacecraft on the surface of a comet. 

The separation was confirmed at 9.03am GMT, with pictures of Philae approaching the comet expected throughout the day before it lands on the surface at 3.30pm GMT.

But the success of the mission now hangs in the balance after a thruster on Philae was found to be faulty.

Mission controllers say there is a 50 per cent chance the cold thruster positioned on top of the lander will work, and without it, Philae will have to rely solely on harpoons to attach to the surface of the comet. The cold thruster was designed to push Philae closer to the comet.

Dr Taylor, the son of a brick layer, was reportedly told to cover his tattoos at media events in the past, but his appearance seems only to have increased his popularity.

Twitter users praised Dr Taylor for being ‘a proper cool scientist’ and ‘definitely not boring’ after he appeared on the European Space Agency live stream and BBC Breakfast wearing a multi-coloured shirt emblazoned with illustrations of glamorous women, which he teamed with shorts, which showed off his tattoos. 

To convince his new team of his dedication, Dr Taylor promised that if Rosetta woke up from its hibernation, he would get a tattoo to commemorate the event. This video shows the creation of the tattoo

Esa has successfully made contact with the Philae lander after it separated from the Rosetta spacecraft this morning at 08.35am GMT. It is now heading towards the comet and is expected to attempt to land on the surface at 4pm GMT. Pictured right is Paolo Ferri, Head of Mission Operations, celebrating making contact

When Philae touches the surface of the comet it will fire harpoons into the surface to keep it anchored there.

To keep it attached to the surface a thruster at the top will push it down as the harpoons fire.

But at the moment the thruster does not appear to be working.

This means the lander will have to rely solely on its harpoons to stay attached to the surface.

It will have to hope they grab the surface immediately and keep the lander anchored there.

If they don’t, the force of firing them could send it floating off into space.

'We’ll need some luck not to land on a boulder or a steep slope,’ said Stephan Ulamec, Philae Lander Manager at the DLR German Aerospace Centre. 

One Twitter user wrote: 'Dr Matt Taylor is what every scientist should look like - rad shirt, sleeve tattoos. Rad,' while another said: ‘Matt Taylor causing thousands of people to choke on their cornflakes this morning.’

Dr Taylor studied at the University of Liverpool and Imperial College London, winning a PhD in space plasma physics

He has worked at the European Space Agency since 2005 and was given the top scientific job on the mission in the summer of 2013.

The role was a real change from his previous job, which was studying the physics of the northern lights, The Guardian reported. 

Professor Mark McCaughrean, senior science advisor at ESA, who appointed Dr Taylor, said that he took a chance on the young scientist as he would have to come up to speed with the mission quickly and gain the trust of older experts who had been working at ESA for decades.

To convince them of his dedication, Dr Taylor promised that if Rosetta woke up from its hibernation, he would get a tattoo to commemorate the event.

In January this happened, and a school friend turned tattoo artist etched a reminder of the ambitious mission on his leg.

In his profile on the Rosetta project website, Dr Taylor says: ‘The opportunity to work on Rosetta was huge and I cannot begin to describe the excitement associated with this mission. It really is just so cool.’

Rosetta has chased comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years in what has been described as 'the sexiest, most fantastic mission ever'. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, it is now positioned in an orbit 19 miles (30 km) away from 67P

Philae has been released but has a damaged thruster, meaning it will have to rely solely on harpoons to attach to the surface of the comet
