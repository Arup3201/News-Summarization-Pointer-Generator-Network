Obese patients will be sent on cookery courses and to Zumba fitness classes by their GPs as part of a drive to tackle diabetes.

Family doctors are being encouraged to target patients most at risk, including those who are seriously overweight.

Under the plans, GPs will refer patients to gym classes such as Zumba, aerobics or spinning – intensive cycling – funded by the NHS.

People will also be advised to attend cooking sessions teaching them how to poach, boil and grill food instead of frying it. 

The initiative extends to overweight NHS staff, who will be encouraged to take dieting classes held at hospitals in order to set a good example to patients. Around 3.8million Britons have diabetes.

The figure has doubled in 20 years, mainly due to obesity. The new scheme will be announced today by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens.

In a speech at a London conference hosted by the charity Diabetes UK, he will say: ‘It’s time for the NHS to start practising what we preach. For over a decade we’ve known that obesity prevention cuts diabetes and saves lives.’

The cookery and Zumba classes have been piloted in Bradford. GPs have been pinpointing patients most at risk of diabetes, including the obese. 

Patients are initially sent to two hour-long sessions at GP practices and community centres which teach them basic tips on healthy eating and losing weight.

The advice includes encouraging them to eat baked potatoes rather than chips and grill or boil vegetables instead of frying them. 

They are then offered vouchers for membership at local gyms. They can also choose to attend cookery classes, specialising in healthy techniques for preparing food, usually held in community centres.

Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: ‘We feel this prevention programme is hugely significant. 

'We hope this will send a clear message that still more needs to be done to help people lead healthy lifestyles.’
