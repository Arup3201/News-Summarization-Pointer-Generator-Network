One week ago, three nuns from New York had to say goodbye to the dog that they had lived with them for about eight years.

The trio - all in their seventies - live in the village of Pomona, north of New Hempstead, and decided to into the Hi Tor Animal Care Center.

They had one intention: To adopt a dog that no one else wanted.

Then they met Remy, a nine-year-old pit bull that had been at the shelter since October.

Sister Veronica Mendez said she knew immediately that they had found their new member of the family.

'I wanted to bring a dog home that might get euthanized if we didn't take her,' Sister Veronica Mendez told News 12.

'And when I noticed the sign said 'nine years,' I said, 'Virginia, we want this one, because nobody else is going to want her.'

West Artope, executive director at Hi Tor, told The Huffington Post that he was surprised that the nuns weren't deterred by the thought of owning a pit bull.

'Most people have a pretty bad understanding of pits," Artope said.

The nuns say Remy has 'already brought a lot of love into the house'

Sister Veronika said that, because Remy was nine-years-old, no one else would have wanted her because people usually get young animals from shelters

'But Remy was sensitive to the sisters, especially to Sister Virginia, who walks with a cane. She kept up with her and was so attentive.'

Remy now lives with the nuns at Sisters of Our Lady of Christian Doctrine.

Artope said that the sisters didn't have to pay for the adoption - Pauline Jarney, a Hi Tor volunteer, and Roberta Bangs, a Hi Tor board member, were so moved by the nuns' actions that they covered the bill.Â
