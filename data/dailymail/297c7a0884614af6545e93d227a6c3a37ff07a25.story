Parents and grandparents should be able to use their pensions to help their children get on the housing ladder, Nick Clegg suggested yesterday.

The ‘pension for property’ plan aims to let those approaching retirement borrow against the lump sum payment in their pension to underwrite the mortgages of young people who cannot afford to buy a home.

Up to a quarter of a pension pot can be paid out in a lump sum when someone retires.

Pensions-for-property: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg says young people need help to buy a home.

The idea is that the cash would not 
actually leave their fund but be used as a ‘guarantee’ that the 
house-buyer would repay the home loan.

The relative would lose the money
 only if the loan repayments were not made.

The Deputy Prime Minister revealed the
 plans in an attempt to show that the Government is helping people who 
have worked hard but cannot afford to give their own children a helping 
hand.

But the plans rapidly began to unravel
 last night as it became clear that only a small minority of families 
would be able to take advantage of them.

Critics said they were a ‘gimmick’ 
which would apply only to the well-off who can afford to risk losing 
some of the money they have saved to finance their retirement.

Former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell (pictured) today called for an end to ‘gossip’ about Nick Clegg’s future at the helm of the party.

Mr Clegg was again dogged by rumours of plots against him today, with Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, and party president Tim Farron, said to be favourites from the left of the party, while Ed Davey, the Energy Secretary, emerged as the standard bearer of the Lib Dem right.

A poll of Lib Dem members by website LibDemVoice revealed his personal rating has fallen below zero for the first time, to minus 2 per cent.

But Sir Menzies, who was ousted as leader weeks after a doomed party conference in 2007, today tried to end the speculation.‘I think this scuttlebutt, this gossip should be put to rest once and for all,’ he told PoliticsHome.

‘If you are serious about the kind of things we’ve been discussing today, then the person who is best qualified to take us forward is Nick Clegg.

‘I am unequivocal in my support for him and so too should you be and so too should members of Parliament and, indeed, the people in the House of Lords as well," he told a fringe event at the party conference in Brighton.

Jo Swinson, a former aide to Mr Clegg promote to become a business minister in the reshuffle, insisted there was no question of her colleagues rounding on their leader.

‘Absolutely not. The parliamentary party sees the job that Nick is doing very, very skilfully in government.’

The Liberal Democrat leader told the 
BBC’s Andrew Marr: ‘At the moment we’ve got thousands of young people 
who are desperate to get their feet on the first rung of the property 
ladder, but deposits have doubled, and the number of young people who 
are asking help from family members to get a mortgage has doubled.

‘The Government is going to do 
something which hasn’t happened before - we’re going to work out ways in
 which parents and grandparents [can] help their children and 
grandchildren buy a property of their own.’

Mr Clegg’s aides said there are 
currently 250,000 households in Britain today where someone has a 
pension pot worth around £40,000, the minimum sum that would be needed 
to take advantage of the scheme.

But experts were swift to point out 
that millions of others would not have the chance to help out because 
their pension pots are too small. The average pot is just £26,000.

Following talks with pension and 
mortgage providers the Lib Dems admitted that only around 12,500 
families would be likely to take up the offer.

Dr Ros Altmann, director general of 
over-50s financial group Saga and a former Downing Street pensions 
adviser, said: ‘This looks like a political gimmick.

‘I’m afraid this sounds like a scheme for kids of relatively well-off parents or grandparents.

‘Most people do not have that much 
money in their pension scheme, and just pledging their lump sum to their
 offspring is hardly likely to solve the problem of unaffordably high 
house prices.’

Joanne Segars, chief executive of the National 
Association of Pension Funds, also questioned whether the scheme would 
work.

‘At first glance this idea leaves us 
feeling slightly uneasy,’ she said. ‘This policy could end up leaving 
retirees out of pocket. The UK already has a serious problem with people
 saving too little for their old age.

‘The Government has already looked at 
letting people have early access to their pensions and decided it 
against it. People need to keep their pension for their retirement, 
especially with rising longevity and the costs of long-term care.’

The Association of British Insurers 
said it would examine the details more closely but echoed those 
concerns. Director general Otto Thoresen warned: ‘Pensions are designed 
to mature into a decent retirement income, not for other purposes.’

Adam Marshall of the British Chambers 
of Commerce said: ‘It sounds like robbing Peter to pay Paul. Employers 
pay into pensions too, and would be unhappy to see money used this way.’
