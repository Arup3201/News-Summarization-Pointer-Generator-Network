This 'hugely offensive' collection of Holocaust memorabilia is set to go under the hammer in the US just days after the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.  

The auction has been branded 'deplorable' for including more than 75 Holocaust-related items such as a wrought metal street sign proclaiming 'Jews not allowed', a guide book on how to gas Jews and an anti-Semitic children's book.

Other  items up for sale include a pair of spectacles once owned by vile Heinrich Himmler, the Nazi commander responsible for the building and running of their concentration camps, and the visor cap worn by a death camp officer.

A solid wooden disc with the words 'He who buys from a Jew is a national traitor' carved into it also features, as does a death certificate issued for Jewish man at Austrian death camp Mauthausen.

This street sign, which reads 'Jews not allowed,' is due to go under the hammer with more than 75-Holocaust related items at Alexander Historical Auctions in Maryland. A buyer is expected to have to pay around $6,000 for the sign

A pair of glasses belonging to Heinrich Himmler, the Nazi commander responsible for the building and running of their concentration camps, are expected to fetch up $8,000

This SS officer tunic and dress trousers will also go under the hammer during the sale, two weeks after the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. It is expected to sell for around $3,000

The sale takes place on February 10 and 11, two weeks after the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz which happened on January 27, 1945.

Nazi memorabilia sales are illegal in France, Germany, Austria and Hungary.

Large auction houses in Britain including Christie's, Sotheby's and Bonhams refuse to sell such material, as does eBay.

It is however legal to hold sales in the US, and the sale at Alexander Historical Auctions in Maryland is the first of four it will hold this year.

The auctioneers have defended the sale, saying they are making sure the horrors of The Holocaust are not forgotten.

But they have come under fire from a Holocaust survivor from, Dorset, England, not only for running the sale but also for taking fees of up to 25 per cent from its proceeds.

Harry Grenville, 88, whose parents, Jacob and Klara Greilsamer, and grandmother, Sara Ottenheimer, were killed at Auschwitz, said the auction was 'hugely offensive' and 'deplorable'.

He said: 'The thing that is most upsetting about this auction is the commercialisation of the Holocaust.

'It is worrying that this auction house is set to make a tidy sum of money from the sale of items that are hugely offensive to a lot of people.

'It raises again the question about freedom of speech - you can't force people to stop selling Holocaust memorabilia and making money from it but you can deplore it.

'The sale is also very badly timed, being so close to the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.

This Nazi book entitled Sterilization, Decontamination, and Disinfection, is said to be a guidebook for the gas chamber. It is expected to be sold for around $2,000

Julius Streicher's anti-Semitic children's book called 'Do not trust a fox in a green pasture or a Jew upon his oath.' Auctioneers expect it to fetch $2,000

This Nazi book on how to spot a Jew is expected to gain bids of around $700 in the auction later this month

An SS document, stating that recruits have been examined, is also up for auction with a guide price of $150

'It is very sad that while most people are quietly remembering the horrors of the Nazi death camps, others are looking to profit from them.'

A wrought iron street sign which reads 'Juden nicht erwunscht' - Jews not allowed - taken from a village in Germany at the end of the war is among the 'highlights' of the sale and has an estimate of $6,000 - around £4,000.

This token, expected to fetch $2,000, has the inscription 'He who buys from Jews is a national traitor'

The catalogue listing notes: 'This item is, regrettably, as genuine as it gets, and is still as disturbing as it was 70 years ago.'

A book titled 'Sterilisation, Decontamination and Disinfection Employment Instructions for Hospital and Laboratory of the Hygiene Institute of the Waffen-SS, Book 3' carries detailed information on how to gas Jews.

The auction house calls it 'an excessively rare 'how-to' book for the Holocaust' and says it is worth $2,000 - around £1,500.

Himmler's glasses come with a note attached to them written by his daughter Gudrun reading 'Papa's old glasses'. They are up for sale for $8,000 - or £6,000.

A children's book titled 'Do Not Trust a Fox in a Green Pasture or a Jew Upon His Oath' contains a host of vitriolic anti Jewish stories.

The book, said to be worth £1,500, was created by Elvira Bauer, an 18-year-old art student, and issued to schoolchildren in Germany in 1936.

Rabbi Andrew Baker, director of International Jewish Affairs at the American Jewish Committee, said: 'It would be preferable that Nazi-era artefacts disappear and not be recycled for profit by auction houses.

'The Maryland auction reminds me of a set of artefacts that was presented to the Vienna Jewish Museum twenty-five years ago shortly after it was established by the City of Vienna.

'They were a compelling illustration of how anti-Semitism was once such a part of everyday life. The challenge for the museum, according to the director, was how to present this in a public exhibition.

'They wanted to be sure that it would demonstrate the evils of anti-Semitism and not inadvertently contribute to it.

British Holocaust survivor Harry Grenville, 88, pictured left today and right in 1946, whose parents, Jacob and Klara Greilsamer, and grandmother, Sara Ottenheimer, were killed at Auschwitz, said the auction was 'hugely offensive' and 'deplorable'

Mr Grenville and his sister Hannah were sent to Britain when they were just two years old.  His mother and father, Jakob and Klara Greilsamer, died in Auschwitz

'It's hard to believe that the people likely to bid on these items will have the same noble goals in mind.'

The Community Security Trust, a British charity established to protect Jews from anti-Semitism, said it would not comment because its staff did not have time to research the auction.

Bill Panagopulos, president of Alexander Auctions, defended the sale saying that by making the items available to buy he is ensuring the atrocities of World War II are not forgotten.

He said: 'Our consignments come from all over the planet - everywhere from dusty attics to unwanted museum holdings.

'The market is quite good for this material. Why? Well, think of another six year period of history that affected the world as greatly as did World War II.

This anti-Semitic book, that features caricatures of Jews, is expected to fetch $400

'In this day and age when so little history is taught in schools, the war remains relevant, important and vitally interesting to almost everyone.

'Many believe that the buyers of this type of material are neo-Nazis, revisionists, or people who idolise the Third Reich. That could not be further from the truth.

'They want 'proof', a connection, a relic - something to prove that these people existed, and that these events happened, good or bad.

'I am committed to making this material available as I believe that 'not all history is good history' and destroying or neglecting these items will only make it easier for revisionists decades or centuries from now to pretend that the Holocaust never happened.

'Dedicated collectors and institutions must have access to this 'criminal evidence' which would otherwise be sold privately and never offered to them.'
