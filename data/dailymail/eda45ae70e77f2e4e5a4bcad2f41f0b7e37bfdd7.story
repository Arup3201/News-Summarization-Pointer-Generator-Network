Two homeless women have confessed to murdering a 51-year-old man after offering him a threesome in their plot to steal his silver Dodge Avenger. A third woman who helped them is accused of conspiracy.

Jennifer McKee, 18, and Ashley Gurule, 20, of New Mexico, admitted to stabbing Maurice Gonzales repeatedly in his Albuquerque home and placing him in the trunk of the car after luring him with sex acts on Friday afternoon.

A third woman, Julia Martinez, 16, was arrested after the trio got into a high speed chase in the car, which ended in a crash KOB.com reported.

They were caught driving very slowly down Interstate 25, which caught the New Mexico State Police's attention.

Gurule and McKee have been charged with his murder, while Martinez is charged with conspiracy.

The girls first accused Gonzales of raping them, but later confessed to his killing.

The two accused of murder admitted 
that they'd offered Gonzales a threesome the night before their crime 
and discussed his killing on Friday morning, as they approached his 
house.

The women planned to 'get him to 
relax' by performing sex acts on him, before Gurule grabbed a knife from
her back pocket and stabbed Gonzales in the neck.

McKee held the man down, while Gurule continued to stab him around five or six times in the chest and neck.

As Gonzales pleaded for his life, the girls then suffocated him with a pillow until he was dead.

They then stuffed him into the trunk of the vehicle and picked up Martinez before driving down Interstate 25.

State Police said the trio was searching for a place to dump Gonzales’ body and dispose of their clothing when an officer tried to stop them for holding up traffic on Interstate 25 in Los Lunas.

The attempted stop turned into high-speed chase that reached 100 mph and ended in a relatively minor crash at an intersection in downtown Belen.

‘They went ahead and initiated a felony stop; pulled out three females,’ State Police Sergeant Emmanuel Gutierrez told KRQE. ‘Upon a security sweep, they located a deceased subject.’

The news channel reported what appeared to be two bullet holes in the front window of the car on the driver's side.
