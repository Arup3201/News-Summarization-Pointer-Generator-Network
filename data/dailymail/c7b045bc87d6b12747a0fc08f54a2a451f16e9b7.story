Andy Murray progressed to the quarter-finals of the Rogers Cup without having to step onto the court after his opponent Richard Gasquet withdrew due to injury.

The pair were scheduled to meet in the third round of the Toronto tournament but the Frenchman  was forced to quit due to an abdominal strain.

The tweet from the tournament's official Twitter feed read: '@richardgasquet1 has had to withdraw from our tournament for both singles and doubles due to an abdominal strain.'

Murray, who beat Australian teenager Nick Kyrgios in the second round, will now meet Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the last eight, after the Frenchman recorded a shock 6-2 6-2 victory over number one seed Novak Djokovic.
