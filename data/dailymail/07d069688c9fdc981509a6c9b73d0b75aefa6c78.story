Fetuses aborted in Canada have been burned at an energy plant to provide power to Oregon homes, the British Columbia Health Ministry has admitted.

The biomedical waste shipped to the Covanta Marion plant in Brooks, Oregon also includes 'surgically removed cancerous tissue' and amputated limbs, officials revealed in an email.

The unsettling details emerged in email correspondence between a Vancouver-based newspaper, the B.C. Catholic, and officials from the British Columbia Health Ministry.

'The ministry understands that some 
[biomedical waste] is transferred to Oregon,' the email said. 'There it 
is incinerated in a waste-to-energy plant.'

The Marion County board of commissioners has now ordered the incinerator to stop accepting boxed medical waste to generate electricity.

Sam Brentano, chairman of the board, said it is taking immediate action to prohibit human tissue from future deliveries at the plant that has been turning waste into energy since 1987.

'We provide an important service to the people of this state and it would be a travesty if this program is jeopardized due to this finding,' he said in a statement.

'We thought our ordinance excluded this type of material at the waste-to-energy facility. We will take immediate action to ensure a process is developed to prohibit human tissue from future deliveries.'

When contacted by The Associated Press on Wednesday, a Covanta Marion representative said he did not know if fetal tissue was included in shipments from Canada or elsewhere.

Commissioners in Marion County did not
 say why they ever believed medical waste shipped to the plant should be
 free of fetal tissue.

The facility is owned and operated by Covanta in a partnership with Marion County.

According to its website, it processes 550 tons per day of municipal solid waste, generating up to 13 megawatts of energy sold to Portland General Electric.

Marion County estimates that the facility processes about 700 tons of in-county medical waste each year and about 1,200 tons from elsewhere, making it a small percentage of the total waste burned.

Out-of-town medical waste is charged a higher fee.

County spokeswoman Jolene Kelley said medical waste has been included in the program for some time, but the commissioners never had any indication that fetal tissue might be included.

'We learned that today,' she said.

The B.C. Catholic reported that around 14,000 fetuses are aborted in the province each year and some parents - 'few' - choose the option of a conventional funeral service. Most leave the waste to be discarded by hospitals.

Since they have no idea what's been arriving in the sealed shipments, the commissioners decided to temporarily suspend all medical waste, Kelley said.

They've scheduled an emergency hearing for Thursday and might rewrite an ordinance to clarify what type of material can be accepted.

Covanta Marion is believed to be the only plant generating energy from waste in Oregon.

The Environmental Protection Agency says medical waste from hospitals is generally excluded from the municipal solid waste used to generate electricity.

The details come one month after it emerged that the 
remains of more than 15,000 aborted babies were incinerated, along with other 'medical waste', to heat and generate 
power for British hospitals.
