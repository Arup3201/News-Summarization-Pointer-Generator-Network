A 14-year-old honor student has passed away after crashing her go kart in a freak accident.

Kierstin Eaddy, an experienced go kart driver, was taking part in a solo race at a Sports Car Club of America autocross event outside Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth on Sunday.

As she passed the finish line, she accelerated instead of slowing down and smashed into a low fence, which ripped off her helmet and brought her kart to a stop in a field next to the track.

Spectators rushed to her aid and she was airlifted to Harris Methodist hospital, where she later died.

Tragic: Kierstin Eaddy, 14, was killed when she lost control of her go kart on Sunday and crashed into a fence

Fort Worth police are now investigating whether the crash was caused by a malfunction with the kart or driver error.

'It is unknown if she lost control 
because of a medical reason or if there was mechanical failure,' Fort 
Worth police spokeswoman Sharron Neal told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

Witness Nick Carnell, who works for the Sports Car Club of America, said the organization requires riders to wear helmets.

He said he'd never seen anything like Sunday's accident before and suggested that perhaps the teenager's throttle had become stuck.

'The
 girl was going past the finish line and something in her go kart failed,' he told CBS DFW. 'She wasn't able to stop it and ran through the fence.'

The Texas Motor Speedway called off its 
events after the wreck on Sunday morning, and the president of the 
Sports Car Club of America, Lisa Noble, released a statement on Sunday.

'All of us at the SCCA are shocked 
and saddened to hear about Sunday's tragic accident involving Kierstin 
Eaddy,' she said.

'We are a Club of families, and are shaken by the loss of this 
young competitor. Personally, and on behalf of the SCCA, my heartfelt 
condolences go out to Kierstinâ€™s family, friends, and the participants 
at Sunday's event.'

Kierstin, 
from Flower Mound, Texas, was an honor student and a volunteer at a nearby 
horse stables, where she worked with children with autism and other 
disabilities.

Her father said his daughter was incredibly spirited, popular with friends and kind hearted.

'She touched the hearts of so many people,' Eaddy told WFAA.
