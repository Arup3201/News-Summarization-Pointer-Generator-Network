She has become a global style icon and a Hollywood A-lister, starring in a string of action movies adored by millions of fans.

But even Angelina Jolie had to start her career somewhere – and that meant modelling clothes for Debenhams and Miss Selfridge for a little-known British magazine.

The long lost pictures, taken when Jolie was just 18, were published under the headline 'Honeychild' in Look in 1993.

Angelina Jolie started her career modelling clothes for Debenhams and Miss Selfridge in tiny British style magazine Look aged 18, pictured reaching for the sky on a beach

The long lost pictures, taken when Jolie was just 18, were published under the headline 'Honeychild' in Look in 1993 and included shots of her squatting on the floor of a desert wearing a headband 

And Angelina was such an unknown that even her name was misspelled – with a 'j' replacing the 'g' in her first name in a caption. 

Living in Los Angeles in her late teens, Angelina signed to the Nina Blanchard agency after her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, suggested she do some modelling.

In the pictures she is seen in two separate shoots: squatting on the floor of a desert, and kneeling on a beach and reaching for the sky.

It is not known if she agreed with the magazine's claim that 'beige is not boring – it encourages people to open up to you.'

Angelina also made her professional acting debut in 1993, playing her first leading role in the science-fiction film Cyborg 2.

Three years later, she appeared in the road movie Mojave Moon, prompting the Hollywood Reporter to write: 'Jolie is an actress whom the camera truly adores.' 

Then came the role of Lara Croft in Tomb Raider in 2001, and it was clear that a major new star had been born.

Angelina is now married to Hollywood heart-throb Brad Pitt and the couple have six children.

She's been touring the world, stunning on the red-carpets from country to country and all in the name of the film she's directed, 'Unbroken'.

And boy did she look the part here in London's Leicester Square.

Donning a Ralph & Russo couture piece, Angelina stunned.

The gorgeous neck-pleat detail could only be couture and the shoulder-cape finish is perfectly on-trend.

Ralph & Russo designed this piece with summer in mind, but the colour keeps popping up on the red carpet this season (think J-Law at The Hunger Games premiere).

So whether you want your little white number for now or next spring, we've rounded up lots of options.

Opt for the Vesper number if you want a piece that mimics Angelina's cape style beautifully. Or head to Missguided or Nasty Gal for bargain buys.
