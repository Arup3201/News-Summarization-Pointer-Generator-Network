Mo Farah will race over 3,000 metres at the opening Diamond League meeting of the year in Doha, organisers have announced.

The double Olympic champion, who has set a world record over two miles indoors and a European half-marathon record in his two outings so far this year, will compete at the meeting in the Qatari capital for the first time on May 15.

Mo Farah is in fine form of late and has already set records this season

Farah smashed the European record and completed thehalf-marathon in Lisbon in under 60 minutes

Farah said: 'There are always very strong fields in the distances so this will be a great early season test on the track for me. I'm looking forward to a good performance.'

The 32-year-old will face a tough field, including the likes of Ethiopian pair Hagos Gebrhiwet and Yenew Alamirew and rising Kenyan star Caleb Ndiku, who won 5,000m gold at last summer's Commonwealth Games in the absence of Farah.Â
