Kerry Kennedy was reportedly under the influence of the sleeping drug Ambien when she smashed into a tractor trailer rig then fled the scene on Friday.

Robert F. Kennedy's daughter, who is the ex-wife of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, was arrested for driving under the influence of drugs when she was found slumped over the wheel of her car after a collision in Westchester County, New York.

The collision comes just two months after her best friend and sister-in-law Mary committed suicide after struggling with alcoholism and drug abuse.

Ms Kennedy, 52, crashed into the big rig 
about 8am om Friday then drove off the highway. The collision damaged 
her car and left it with a flat tire.

Police arrived at the scene after a 911 call reported erratic driving on the freeway.

They then discovered Ms Kennedy passed out at the wheel of the white 2008 Lexus RS 350. There were no passengers.

She apparently told police that she had taken prescription sleeping pills - said to include the drug Ambien - before the accident, according to WABC.

After her arrest, Ms Kennedy was charged with driving while impaired with drugs.

She is due to appear in court in North Castle on Tuesday.

A spokesman for Ms Kennedy denied that she was under the influence.

Ken Sunshine told the New York Times: 'Kerry Kennedy voluntarily took breathalyzer, blood and urine tests â€“ all of which showed no drugs or alcohol whatsoever in her system.

'The charges were filed before the test results were available.'

If Ms Kennedy is found to have been under the influence of Ambien, she could have a legal basis for combating the driving under the influence charge.

Driving while intoxicated? Ms Kennedy says she had taken the sleeping pill Ambien, which has been known in rare cases to cause 'sleep-driving'

The 'Ambien defense' is a relatively new strategy that has been successfully used to clear drivers who had taken the medication before being arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated.

Doctors have recorded rare cases of the drug causing people to eat, walk and even get behind the wheel of a car while under the effects of the popular sedative. In those cases, the patients claimed to have no memory of their actions. As a result, courts have found they are not criminally liable for their actions.

However, most successful uses of the defense argument have come in cases where the defendants were found during normal sleeping times and often when they were discovered wearing pajamas.

Ms Kennedy, one of the most prominent members of the legendary Kennedy family, is the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and the niece of President John F. Kennedy.

Celebration: Ms Kennedy with Mr Cuomo during his first New York gubernatorial campaign in 2002

Her father was Senator for New York then U.S. Attorney General before being assassinated during his 1968 presidential campaign.

She re-entered the public eye as the wife of Mr Cuomo, a member of Bill Clinton's cabinet who was elected as Governor of New York in 2010.

The couple have three children but divorced in 2005 after 13 years of marriage.

Ms Kennedy was best friends with her sister-in-law Mary Richardson Kennedy, who killed herself at her New York home in May after her marriage to Robert F. Kennedy Jr disintegrated.

Kerry delivered an emotional eulogy at Mary's funeral, describing her friend as an 'angel' who had been destroyed by her own 'forces of evil'.
