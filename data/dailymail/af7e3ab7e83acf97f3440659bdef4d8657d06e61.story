When a 13-foot, 719 pound alligator menaced a Florida property, a restaurant executive took it upon himself to hunt the beast and serve it up proudly at his establishments.

Clark Woodsby works as the senior operating partner for Talk of The Town restaurants and is responsible for picking fresh foods for Orlando restaurants like MoonFish even if it means catching the dish himself.

One week ago he and a group of trappers were called to a private property in Polk County where a massive gator was roaming the land.

Here comes dinner: One week ago Clark Woodsby nabbed this 13-foot, 719 pound alligator roaming a private property and will serve it at his restaurant

Tastes like chicken!: Woodsby said his restaurant group buys approximately 2,000 pounds of gator meat monthly and that residents of Central Florida have developed a liking for the local delicacy

Hungry for more?: Woodsby along with some trappers managed to hunt this giant reptilian beast 

'I had a crossbow, and I waited until it was 15 yards away; I shot it right in the side, in the shoulder,' Woodsby told Fox.

Shooting the gator with a crossbow is how he and the trappers could track the gator.

It took 45 minutes from the men to catch the gator who was putting up a strong fight.

'It starts spinning. It starts doing the death roll. There were four of us total, each of us take turns fighting it because our hands were getting torn up from the rope,' Woodsby said of the impressive feat.

Woodsby finally managed to hit the gator in the back with a dart.

'I have a harpoon with another dart and was able to get it into the back of the gator,' Woodsby said.

After finally conquering the carnivorous reptile, Woodsby processed it and sent it to restaurants like MoonFish.

Woodsby said his restaurant group buys approximately 2,000 pounds of gator meat monthly and that residents of Central Florida have developed a liking for the local delicacy.

Fresh food: Clark Woodsby serves food so fresh at his restaurant he's killed some of it himself 

Dinner is served: Gator meat has become a favorite of Central Florida residents who are happy to get the reptile off of their land and onto the plate
