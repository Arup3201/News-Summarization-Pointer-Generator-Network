Tanning salons are offering discounted solarium deals before a ban on the controversial machines kicks in on New Year's Day, triggering health concerns.

Beauty salon Skin Essentials in Elwood of Melbourne is among those promoting $1.50-a-minute specials before the ban on commercial solariums come into force from January 1 across the country.

It comes after the government announced a three year introduction period for the ban allowing the solaria industry time to transition their business to safer alternatives.

With the government cracking down on sunbeds in an effort to reduce skin cancer rates,  businesses who operate under the new laws will face heavy fines.

Commercial solariums will be banned in all states except Western Australia in a bid to reduce skin cancer

Chair of public health of Cancer Council Australia Craig Sinclair said any businesses operating after the New Year will face heavy fines

Chair of public health of Cancer Council Australia Craig Sinclair said businesses operating solariums after the New Year will be operating illegally in Australia and will subject to significant fines by state authorities.

‘These operators are using their last breath of legitimacy but any efforts to bring in more customers is not a good thing especially when they know they can't operate when the ban takes effect in two weeks time,’ Sinclair told Daily Mail Australia.

‘With the evidence found in recent studies, there is a strong link between melanoma and sunbed use. Research shows that one in every six people who use a solarium has a greater risk of melanoma than those who do not use it.

‘We're dealing with an operation that is clearly designed for cosmetic use – clearly balancing lies verses desire for cosmetic so it's sensible for the government to make the right decision.'

It has been estimated that each year in Australia, 281 melanoma cases, 43 melanoma related deaths and 2,572 squamous cell carcinomas are attributable to solarium use.

‘There is a strong link between sunbeds and melanoma deaths reported and the sooner solariums cease to operate, the more lives will be saved,’ Sinclair said.

‘Ultimately, not only are people putting their skin at risk but they’re putting their own lives at risk who continue to use sunbeds.

‘There is no such thing as a safe tan from using UV sources but there are much safer alternative options people do such as spray on tans, which beauty services have already offer.’

Until the ban becomes effective , all commercial solaria businesses  will continue to operate sunbeds

Skin Essentials co-owner Amie Mita told Daily Mail Australia that the government’s ban on solariums should’ve been dealt differently.

‘I think it’s an odd thing to take away people’s choice but I’m not going to agree or disagree with the ban but it could’ve been done a different way,’ she said.

‘Educate people on UV light and encourage them to speak to their doctors and do mandatory skin checks every year – this is something we’ve been highly promoting to our clients.

‘We have well-trained staff here who tell our clients “how much is too much” and we make sure they wear enough sunscreen if they’re going to be outdoors.

‘We know too much UV is not good and our sessions usually run between four minutes to a maximum of 16 and we always top it up with spray tan when our clients request to be darker.

Skin Essentials is currently running specials - alerting clients through text message about the 'end of era' deals - charging $14 for eight minutes, and an extra $1.50-a-minute after that.

‘The special is a little novelty that we offer every now and then but we wanted to see our clients and let them know we’re still here and will continue our other beauty services when the solarium ban is lifted.’

Until the ban becomes effective on 31 December 2014, all commercial solaria businesses in NSW, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia will continue to be subject to existing Regulation introduced in 2009.

Western Australia and Tasmania are yet to announce a ban.
