Christine Hall, pictured, has been slapped with an Asbo after terrorising the quiet cul-de-sac where she lives in in Lancashire

A former nurse labelled ‘The Witch of Kittiwake Close’ was warned she could end up in prison after waging a terrifying and bizarre campaign against her neighbours in a quiet seaside street.

Spinster Christine Hall, 54, wrote poison pen letters, used her Highland terrier to menace children, banged on windows and roamed the street wearing a hangman’s noose.

She even attempted to commit suicide in front of horrified neighbours and their children after they complained about her frightening behaviour.

Today she was issued with a two-year anti-social behaviour order at Blackpool Magistrates’ Court, banning her from making or wearing hangman’s nooses in public view or from speaking to any child unless they are in danger.

Hall was told if she breaks the conditions of the Asbo she could face up to five years in prison.

The court heard how police repeatedly arrested her and built up a dossier of 40 complaints before she was deemed mentally fit enough to be hauled into court.

Hall would put a noose around her neck and stand in her porch on a set of ladders, waiting for her neighbours to arrive home in Kittiwake Close in Cleveleys, Lancashire.

On one occasion neighbour Rachel Walker, 32, returned home to see Hall kick away the ladder and drop to the floor - as her son screamed in terror.

She only survived after heavily pregnant Mrs Walker cut her down and had her taken to hospital.

Hall, who would creep up on drivers and scream through the car window ‘I’m coming to get you’, also falsely accused one couple of child abuse and poisoning her dog Meg.

One boy was so scared of Hall he suffered regular nightmares, believing she would walk through walls at night.

Neighbours wrote to hospital bosses and then Health Secretary Andrew Lansley about their problems to try and get help for Hall, but were told doctors could not discuss the matter due to patient confidentiality.

Police have built up a file of more than 40 complaints against Christine Hall, pictured here after moving a wheelie bin into the middle of the street

A number of house are up for sale on Kittiwake Close following the upsetting behaviour of Christine Hall, who frequently blocked off the road with wheelie bins

Pictures taken by a neighbour show the odd actions of the former nurse, pictured with her dog Meg which neighbours say she used to terrorise children

After the court hearing housewife Rachel Walker, 32, spoke of the nightmare of living next to the woman, who accused her and her husband, college lecturer Mark, 33, of abusing one of their two sons; Isaac, four and Alex, two.

Mrs Walker said: ‘This lady has been an absolute nightmare - especially after what she has put the kids through.

‘She started putting letters though our door, things like what ‘the definition of consideration’ was and that we were making too much noise and falsely accusing us of abusing our son.

‘But she also accused us of poisoning her dog, things escalated to the point where one day I went to pick up my husband from work and when I came back she was hanging from the front porch.

‘Neighbours said she was standing there waiting and when she saw us coming round the corner she kicked the ladders away, I had to cut her down, I was heavily pregnant at the time - it was awful.

‘She would bang on the outside window with her keys and she stands and stares into the living room. Isaac is terrified of her and he wouldn’t go to the toilet because he would have to pass the front door and thinks she might be there.

A diary kept by a neighbour documents details including a hanging attempt and shows a picture of bins and plant pots moved into the middle of the road blocking car parking spaces

Another extract has notes about her shouting at children and photos of a wheelie bin obstructing the pavement

‘He has nightmares that she will come
through the walls at night. She walks her dog on an extendable lead and
lets it run up to them and then pulls it back.

‘She is clearly not getting the support she needs, but the mental health service say she is capable of facing criminal charges.

‘She
hangs nooses outside her house all the time usually after police have 
spoken to her and my children should not be subjected to seeing 
something like that, I can’t let them play out without being sat at the 
front watching them.

‘My house has been up for sale for two years but I’ve had people cancel viewings because they keep seeing nooses outside next door.

‘We even reduced the value by £10,000 just to get a quick sale but we still haven’t been successful. All we want is for Christine to leave us alone and get on with her own life so that we can get on with ours.’

Hall began terrorising her neighbours after losing her job at Blackpool Victoria Hospital.

In 2006 she was convicted of breaching a restraining order after bombarding a former colleague with 88 phone calls – including her cackling down the phone.

She was also convicted of three charges of assault on neighbours.

Another extract from earlier this year show Hall washing her car while her dog sits in the boot, although neighbours said she never used any water

During her campaign she would accuse neighbours of being too noisy then play loud music herself, block pathways outside her £112,000 terraced house with wheelie bins and plant pots and injure herself to get attention.

Neighbour Sandra Ronson 69, said: ‘Children will come out and walk a different way just to avoid her house and seeing her, she follows the children and I’ve seen her pick the dog up and point it in the direction of the children.

‘One day when I was watching TV she came to the window and stood there and her arms were pouring with blood and she was saying "you have done this".

‘She’ll stand with the noose around her neck until she gets the right audience then jumps. Nobody in this day in age should have to witness that on their street.’

Hall’s lawyer Neil Cheesbrough said: ‘My client accepts this order rather against advice. I am not sure if ASBOs were created for this type of behaviour. But Miss Hall does not have the will for a fight. She is desperate to move from this area and her home is up for sale.’

Hall said at her home: ‘The neighbours have a vendetta and are just ganging up on me. Is it any wonder I have tried to hang myself.’
