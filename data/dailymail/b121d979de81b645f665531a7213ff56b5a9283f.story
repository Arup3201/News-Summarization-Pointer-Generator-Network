A betting shop sign that killed a pedestrian when it ripped off in high winds may have been weakened after maintenance carried out before Christmas, it was claimed today.

The sign on the William Hill betting shop crashed down on top of the passerby in Camden Road, north London, just before 5pm last night splitting his head open.

The victim, in his 20s and from New Zealand, suffered a cardiac arrest. He was treated at the scene but died later in University College Hospital.

Hoarding was put up around a bookmakers in north London today

The bookmakers was closed today as health and safety officials started to inspect the scene for clues

It is feared that the hoarding may have fallen from the front of the building after coming loose in high winds

Flowers were today left at the scene of the tragic accident as it emerged maintenance work may have taken place on the building before Christmas

Friends at the scene in Camden left an emotional tribute to the victim, named on a written tribute as 'Jacko'.

The group of three women and a man left a card and flowers in front of the Camden William Hill store this afternoon about 2.30pm

Visibly distraught, the group also left a New Zealand flag as a tribute to their friend, who suffered a cardiac arrest and died shortly after being rushed to hospital.

The moving written tribute, left amongst other bouquets of flowers at the scene, said: 'This is not how it was supposed to go. We had so many good plans and so many good memories. I promise never to forget you.'

Today pensioner Dave Preston who 
lives above the betting shop claimed the fascia board could have been weakened by pigeon spikes put up there.

The 68-year-old, who has lived above the shop for 45 years, said: 'I was in the kitchen and I heard what sounded like an
explosion, I didn't know what to think, I thought it could have been 
the gas.

Police have cordoned off the scene and are currently carrying out an investigation

The man was treated at the scene in Camden Road for a head injury and transferred to hospital where he later died, London Ambulance Service said

'I looked outside and saw this poor 
guy lying there. He must have been about 26, he was lying motionless, 
his head all open, the blood was terrible.

'I just felt sorry for his parents or 
girlfriend or maybe wife I don't know. It is just tragic to think about,
such a young life.'

Other witnesses have also spoken of the tragic scene.

Ken Osbourne, 28, who works in Woody 
Grill next to the betting shop said: 'I saw the guy lying down in the road, covered in blood.

'The main impact was clearly on his head. the blood was mainly around his head. I saw them trying to resuscitate him in the back of the ambulance.'

Shopkeeper Fazle Elahi, who works 
opposite the scene and was on the scene to witness the aftermath, told 
the Camden New Journal: 'The ambulance came really quickly. It looked 
like the William 
Hill sign had hit him. A woman at the scene was crying. He wasn't 
moving.'

Ioana Nita, 21, was working at a nearby restaurant when the accident happened at 4.55pm.

'I'm shocked. We heard a very loud noise. Me and a colleague went outside and saw the guy lying on the floor,' she said.

'Five guys picked up the sign and it was put on the side. His hands were covered in blood and he wasn't moving.

'Lots of people were in a circle 
around him, then the ambulance arrived and they were trying to get him 
back to life, pressing on his heart.'

She added: 'I just want to go home and
cry. I don't know how that can happen. The sign is huge. Everyone said 
he was just walking past the shop.

'I cross that way five times a day. That could have been me.'

A nearby worker added: 'It was the 
centre of Camden during the rush hour. It's a horrible day, raining and 
windy. It looks like the entire front facade of William Hill was blown 
off and hit the man.'

Pictures of the scene show the twisted large blue frontage of the shop stretching across the pavement.

A London Ambulance Service 
spokeswoman said: 'An ambulance crew who were close to the incident were
on the scene very quickly with another medic in responder car.

'Extensive
efforts were made to resuscitate him both at the scene and on way to 
hospital. He was taken to University College Hospital as a priority on 
blue lights.'

A Met 
Police spokesman said: 'Officers and London Ambulance Service attended 
and the man, believed aged in his 20s, has been taken to a central 
London hospital for treatment - he died there a short while later.

'At
this early stage it appears the man received his injuries after being 
struck by sign or board which has fallen from a building.'

Police have cordoned off the scene and are currently carrying out an investigation.

Camden Council has also confirmed it is launching an investigation into what caused the sign to fall.

Camden Council's cabinet member for community safety, Councillor Abdul Hai, said: 'This is tragic incident and our thoughts are with the victim’s family at this sad time.

'Our health and safety and building control teams attended the scene immediately to take the necessary action to make sure there was no further danger to the public from the building.  

'We are helping the police secure the site so that we can gather evidence as part of our formal investigation which starts tomorrow.'

A William Hill spokeswoman said: 'There is an urgent investigation under way and we are still establishing facts and liaising with authorities.'

A spokeswoman from the New Zealand High Commission confirmed the man, who is yet to be formally identified, was a New Zealand national.

She said the commission had been in touch with his family back home who had asked for privacy.

'We are aware of the death. The High Commission has been providing consular assistance to the family, who have requested their privacy be respected at this time.

'It's understood the family is in New Zealand.'
