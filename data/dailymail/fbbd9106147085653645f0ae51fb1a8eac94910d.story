A businessman killed a love rival after rekindling a relationship with a former girlfriend from 40 years ago, a court heard yesterday.

Kenneth Bill, 63, allegedly hatched an elaborate murder plot after the married woman ended their relationship.

He believed a romance with the girlfriend of his youth could work with her husband John Hay, 61, out of the way, the jury was told.

Bill had ‘become obsessed’ with her 
and ‘closed his mind to the obvious fact the relationship was going 
nowhere’, the court heard.

He lured Mr Hay, a self-employed builder and former police officer, to an industrial unit by posing as a potential customer.

He allegedly pushed Mr Hay down 
stairs at the unit in Meltham, West Yorkshire, and attacked him.

Bill 
burnt the body on land near his home, Bradford Crown Court was told.

Robert Smith, QC, prosecuting, said 
Bill drove his victim’s van near the Humber Bridge 70 miles away to make
his disappearance look like a suicide.

Mr Hay was never seen again by family
after he dropped his granddaughter off at school on March 15. His body 
has never been found.

Carol Hay, 62, suspected Bill’s 
involvement and told police about their relationship after recognising 
his voice on an answerphone message left for her husband, the court was 
told.

Before meeting her husband, Mrs Hay, 
then 19, and Bill were a couple for about five years, the jury heard. 
She married Mr Hay in 1974.

In October last year a friend mentioned seeing Bill recently and she decided to contact him. They met several times.

‘As the relationship progressed she realised she had made a mistake,’ Mr Smith said.

She told Bill she loved her husband and was never going to leave him and the relationship with Bill was over, the court heard.

Bill told Mrs Hay he loved her, Mr 
Smith said. Her husband was unaware of the rekindled relationship and 
the jury has not been told how close or intimate Bill and Mrs Hay 
became, if at all.

Bill, the owner of a drilling 
business, who had split from his wife five years earlier, told a 
colleague of a plan to lure Mr Hay to the unit and dissolve his body in 
acid, the jury heard, before saying he had decided to stage a suicide.

Apparent notes of a murder plan were 
found at Bill’s home and his computer revealed searches for the Humber 
Bridge and sulphuric and nitric acid, Mr Smith said.

Blood and a tooth matching Mr Hay’s 
DNA were found at the unit. The scene of the fire contained evidence a 
body had been burned.

Bill, of Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, 
denies murder. He claimed the victim died as a result of an accident 
when he met Mr Hay to tell him about the relationship and Mr Hay 
attacked him.

The case continues.
