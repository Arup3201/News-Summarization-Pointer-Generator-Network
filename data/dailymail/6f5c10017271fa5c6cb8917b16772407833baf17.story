'This is a celebration of something that should have happened a very long time ago,' the Rev. Linda Hunsaker told the small group of close friends and family who attended.

The women met in their hometown of Yale, Iowa, while growing up. 

Then they moved to Davenport in 1947 where Miss Boyack taught school and Miss Dubes did payroll work.

Miss Dubes said the two have enjoyed their life together and over the years they have travelled to all 50 states, all the provinces of Canada, and to England twice.

'We've had a good time,' Miss Dubes said.

Boyack said it takes a lot of love and work to keep a relationship going for 72 years.

Longtime friend Jerry Yeast, 73, said he got to know the couple when he worked in their yard as a teenager.

'I've known these two women all my life, and I can tell you, they are special,' Yeast said.

Iowa began allowing gay marriage in 2009.

The two women say it is never too late for a new chapter in life.
