For a while it seemed like Novak Djokovic was done, another big seed facing a big loss. He was startlingly poor for two sets, slipping and sliding and whingeing and dropping points. Then he changed his shoes and fortunes.

Sometimes the simple solutions are best. With new footwear he looked like a different player to the one who had followed a 6-1 first-set win by losing the next two 6-3, 7-6.

He promptly blitzed the fourth set 6-2 and then the third 6-2 to see off the 26th seed and set-up an intriguing semi-final against Grigor Dimitrov, who crushed Andy Murray so emphatically earlier in the day.

Nervy: But Novak Djokovic did come out on top against Marin Cilic in a five-set thriller at Wimbledon

Respect: The Croatian 26th seed pushed him all the way on Court No 1

Fan favourite: The top seed salutes to the crowd following his victory

Uncomfortable: Djokovic was two sets to one down at one stage, and seemed to be all at sea

Not his day: It was a frustrating day at the office for Djokovic on Court No 1 on Wednesday

But this was exceedingly hard work.

At
 one stage, Djokovic was so tetchy that the outside noise caused by that
 Centre Court match was visibly bothering him. He waited between points,
 huffing and puffing and staring at the umpire.

For
 sure, much of the frustration would have been born in his own 
performance. This was often rusty, uncharacteristic tennis from such a 
supremely talented athlete.

To
 think it was all looking so easy early on. Djokovic charged through the
 first set, breaking twice as Cilic fell victim to his nerves.

At
 one stage, the Croat attempted a backhand from the back of the court 
and it barely reached the net, so misjudged was his power.

Djokovic wrapped up the set 6-1 in only 27 minutes but even then was doing what he was needed and not a huge amount more.

In
 the second, he fell a long way short. An element of that was down to 
his form slipping, a larger reason was the sudden discovery of range by 
Cilic, both on serve and in the effectiveness of his forehand. From 
winning only six points on his first serve in the opening set, Cilic 
took 13 of 19 in the second.

Physique: Djokovic returns a shot somewhat unconventionally, showing off his acrobatic side

Crucial: Cilic celebrates winning the third set, putting him 2-1 in front

He
 broke for 3-1 and quickly raced to 5-2. Djokovic had his moments, 
playing a sublime point at 2-5, 30-30, when he sucked Cilic into the net
 and then played a delicious lob. But Cilic, occasionally questionable 
under duress, held it together with some big forehands. He served out 
the set for 6-3.

The 
26th seed broke for 6-5 in the third and then gave it straight back, 
farcically dropping the first point of his service game by hitting the 
net with his racket on a routine smash. The tiebreak was then a calamity
 of errors, both players trading mini-breaks before Djokovic put a 
backhand long for 7-4 Cilic.  

Two
 early breaks put Djokovic in command of the third set, not to mention a
 new pair of shoes after several slips. He closed the set 6-2 at the 
first time of asking with a service winner. Goran Ivanisevic, Cilic’s 
coach, stopped smiling.

From
 there, Djokovic closer resembled his usual self. He broke in the first 
game of the decider – crucially the top seed found his range on his 
backhand – and at one stage won 14 straight points on serve. He got a 
second break and, arguably, a second chance in these Championships. 
Upset avoided.
