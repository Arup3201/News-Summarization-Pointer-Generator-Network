A biker who claimed he was shunted off his Harley-Davidson by an angry bus driver was sent a high-visibility jacket as an apology, it emerged today.

Pub landlord and father-of-one Gerry McLoughlin, 47, of Bristol, said he was knocked off his motorbike after an altercation with the First bus driver who had sounded his horn at him.

But when he complained the firm sent him the jacket, an offer of cycling lessons and an invitation to two events aimed at helping bus drivers and cyclists understand the obstacles they both face.

Mr McLoughlin, who suffered painful burns to his leg in the crash, said: ‘I feel like I am being mocked.

‘My leg got badly infected which meant I had to stay at home for a week having it dressed while my wife and daughter went on holiday. Even when I got out there I couldn’t go in the pool so it ruined it.’

Mr McLoughlin admits he swore at the driver of the number 45 bus when he beeped his horn at him in Bristol city centre on July 26 last year.

But he claims the driver then rammed into the back of his bike - knocking him off - and then refused to hand over his details.

Mr McLoughlin, who runs the Miners Arms in Bedminster, Bristol, added: ‘He didn’t need to knock me off my bike. I went round to the next stop where he was and wanted his details.

‘He said there was CCTV everywhere so not to worry but I said I still wanted his details.

'They claim I hit the bus and fell off then chased him and told him I would smash him up - that’s just nonsense.’

The fall caused painful burns to his right leg which forced him to delay his family holiday to Spain with wife Tracey, 49, and daughter Finola, 11, by a week so he could have treatment.

He called First to ask them to speak to the driver about his behaviour and the incident is being investigated by insurance claim handlers.

But last month he was sent an invite to cycling proficiency lessons and the fluorescent vest.

Jonathan Barnard, general manager of First, said the company made a mistake.

He said: ‘We are aware of the incident involving Mr McLoughlin and this is currently being dealt with by our insurance claim handlers. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.

‘In relation to the pack sent to Mr McLoughlin, this was sent to him in error.

Gerry McLoughlin

‘The packs were intended for cyclists - not motorcyclists - and were sent to reassure those people who’d had cause to raise concerns with us during the previous year.

‘They were sent in good faith and outlined the various things we have been doing to improve mutual understanding, while also offering general guidance regarding stay safe when cycling near large vehicles.

‘We would like to offer our apologies to Mr McLoughlin for any misunderstanding.’
