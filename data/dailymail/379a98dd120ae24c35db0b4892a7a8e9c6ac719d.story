However, current owner Steve Laws told the Daily Telegraph they had not experienced any supernatural incidents while living there.

Fred Fisher was an English-born Australian farmer from Campbelltown who suddenly disappeared in 1826.

Four months after he vanished, Farley ran into the local hotel in a very agitated state claiming he had seen Fisher’s ghost sitting on the rail of a nearby bridge.

The legend of the ghost is now celebrated in an annual festival in Campbelltown in November and the creek – now a storm water drain - beside which the body was discovered is known as Fisher's Ghost Creek

The typical colonial house has been 'meticulously restored over time to present a wonderful family home'

Farley was an emancipist, one of many of the convicts sentenced and transported under the convict system to Australia who had been given conditional or absolute pardons, and arrived in Australia in 1812.

He became a farmer and settled down with his wife Margaret in their new home, located on the 325 acre farm on the Appin Road.

Farley died in 1841, a year after he sold the sandstone brick house to magistrate John Bray.

The house remained in the Bray family for many years and in 1866 Joshua Bray wrote and described a curious incident in the night.

The house now boasts modern pleasures such as a swimming pool and there's even 'enough room for a pony'

'They are very much excited about here, the Mail was robbed ten days ago....The night before last they stopped it about a quarter of a mile from this house- the coachman and passengers came about 4 o'clock in the morning to tell us. These robberies take place in the night...they were hiding all their jewellery. Papa has loaded his pistol,' he said.

The typical colonial house, surrounded by a stone flagged verandah, has been ‘meticulously restored over time to present a wonderful family home’, Ray White real estate agent's website explains.

In about 1917 the Hickey’s bought the house and leased it to the Carroll family. It then became derelict until it was restored in 1864.

The listing on the Ray White website adds: 'Comprising of four bedrooms plus a study this home comes complete with a variety of different living areas. ‘Feel the warmth of the fireplace in the formal living or enjoy sun filled family areas.'

The house now boasts modern pleasures such as swimming pool and gardeners can enjoy the fruit trees, veggie patch and there’s even ‘enough room for a pony’.
