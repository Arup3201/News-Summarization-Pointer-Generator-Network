Hard-pressed motorists received a scrap of good news today as Chancellor George Osborne axed the fuel duty increase planned for the autumn.

The rise would have put 3p on a litre of the already high price of petrol and diesel at the pumps and the Coalition has now scrapped or frozen every scheduled fuel duty rise since 2010.

The Treasury says petrol is now 13p lower than it would have been under Labour.

Relief: Drivers will not have to pay an extra 3p in fuel duty this autumn but many say the Chancellor should have cut prices, not frozen them

Road tax for car drivers is to rise in line with RPI inflation.

That will mean an increase of between £5 and £15 for the standard tax-rate of all but the very cleanest cars.

Road tax rates for new car buyers will rise in the first year from between £5 and £35 to a maximum £1,065 for the biggest ‘gas guzzlers.’

Drivers will now have 14 days ‘grace’ after the time their car tax is paid before having to display their tax disc. Currently the grace period is five days.

The good news for classic car drivers is that cars manufactured before January 1, 1974 will now be exempt  from road tax – extending the current exemption by a year from 1973.

Declaring a car ‘off-road’ - and therefore not liable to tax - will in future be done on an ‘indefinite’ basis, rather than having to be renewed each year. This is ‘to reduce tax administration costs.’

A planned reform of Vehicle Excise Duty to coincide with controversial road charging and tolls schemes has been deferred until after the General election.

The move was welcomed by the Tory MP for Harlow, Robert Halfon – 
although some motorists’ organisations said the move did not go far 
enough.

Mr Halfon said: ‘This was a cost of living Budget. It puts fuel in the 
tank of the British economy. I'm glad that the Chancellor has listened 
again, and helped the millions of car-owners and businesses who are 
struggling to fill up their family car.

‘Fuel duty is a toxic tax. It hits the poorest Brits the hardest. We have to keep petrol and diesel prices down.’

Two thirds of the cost of petrol is made
up of tax, either fuel duty or VAT. Tax accounts for more of the cost 
of petrol than in any other EU country.

Figures from the RAC Foundation show that 800,000 British families now spend one quarter of their income on running a car.

Mr Osborne announced last December that he would scrap a planned 3p hike
in fuel duty set for January and postpone a rise set for next month.

Geoff Dunning, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, said the Government should have gone further than merely cancelling planned 
future rises – he should have announced a cut in fuel duty.

The RHA claims that every rise in fuel duty by 3p cuts 35,000 jobs and growth by 0.1 per cent.

Electric company cars will for the first time be taxed under benefit in kind rules.

Electric vehicles such as Nissan’s Leaf are currently zero-rated for company car ‘benefit in kind’ rules.

But from 2015 there will be a 5 per cent ‘bik’ rate, rising to  7 per cent the following year.

It means a top-rate tax payer who currently pays zero tax on  a Nissan Leaf electric company car will pay £569 in 2015.

And a 20 per cent basic rate tax payer will pay £284 a year or £24 per month in company car tax.

And those who drive the electric plug-in hybrid Toyota Prius (49g/km CO2 levels)  will see their benefit in kind rate more than double by 2016-17 – from 5 per cent to 11 per cent.

Ashley Hollinshead, tax partner at  accountancy firm Deloitte said: ’This is a bit of  a kick in the teeth for people who went out in good faith to buy the greenest cars – including electric cars -  but now see the Chancellor tightening the screw. This trend is repeated across the various benefit in kind levels.’

But Nissan, whose second generation electric Leaf rolls off the line at their Sunderland factory next week,  said; ’It could have been worse. At one stage the Treasury were talking about a 15 per cent benefit in kind hike for electric cars.  We’d have preferred to continue with a zero rate, but at least this is not as bad as it might have been.’

The Treasury said: ‘The appropriate percentage of the list price subject to tax for the 0-50 g/km CO2 band will be 5 per cent in 2015-16, and 7 per cent in 2016-17.

‘The appropriate percentage of the list price subject to tax for the 51-75 g/km CO2 band will be 9 per cent in 2015-16 and 11 per cent in 2016-17.’ BY RAY MASSEY

‘UK road transport operators are the people who actually keep the wheels of the economy moving,’ he said.

‘To them, diesel fuel represents the life blood without which, they are 
unable to function. Yet for many hauliers, high levels of fuel duty mean
that diesel is fast becoming a luxury item.’

Pressure group FairFuelUK criticised Mr Osborne’s decision not to go for a fuel duty cut.

‘Scrapping the planned autumn rise may be a welcome signal that the 
government is listening, but families will be devastated that fuel duty 
isn’t going to be cut,’ said spokesman Quentin Wilson.

‘All the polls say that the country wants a reduction in their petrol 
and diesel bills, and actually lowering duty is the only way to offer 
that relief and boost UK growth.’

Mr Cameron was tackled on the issue of fuel duty while visiting the Mercedes-Benz plant in Milton Keynes earlier this month.

He said: ‘I totally understand that many people have to run a car. It’s not a choice, particularly if you live in rural areas.

‘I understand that people look at the price of petrol and diesel, they 
look at the cost of running even an inexpensive family car and it’s 
still a very big amount they are paying.

'So we’ve got to do everything we can to help people get on, help people get to work, help people live their lives.’

Mr Osborne's announcement, which had been widely expected, was welcomed by some motoring groups.

AA president Edmund King said: 'A 
September fuel duty hike would have been the last straw likely to break 
UK drivers' budgets and would have led to a summer of discontent.

'The
scrapping is a pragmatic move and will bring some relief at the pumps. 
Already 76 per cent of AA members are cutting back on journeys, 
household expenditure or both, due to the high cost of fuel.'

Professor
Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'This news 
provides breathing space for families being smothered by the soaring 
costs of motoring, especially the 800,000 households spending more than a
quarter of their income on operating a vehicle.' 

Rising costs: The average 5p a litre increase in February added £2.50 to the cost of a typical 50-litre refill this month
