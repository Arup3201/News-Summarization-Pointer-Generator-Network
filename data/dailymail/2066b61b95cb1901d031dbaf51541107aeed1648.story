It might sound like a recipe for disaster - or at the very least an impromptu barbecue - but the latest weapon against cows' methane emissions is a laser beam.

Professor Deli Chen will not be aiming the energy weapon at cows' rear ends, however - instead, he aims to use methane to measure how much methane cow flatulence emits into the atmosphere.

‘This is a critical step if we are to 
help agriculture reduce its emissions because if you can’t measure, you 
can’t mitigate,’ Professor Chen said.

Australian agriculture directly accounts
for 10% of the country’s overall greenhouse gas emissions - and a
new research collaboration called the Methane Research Cluster aims to 
reduce that impact.

Chen's research has shown that simple addition of inhibitors to manure and soil can reduce emissions by up to 80%The 
collaboration, led by researchers from the University of Melbourne, aims
to improve measurement and management of methane emissions for the 
grazing lands of northern Australia thought to be responsible for five 
per cent of the country’s overall greenhouse gas emissions.

Led by Associate Professor Deli Chen (PhD 1996) from the Melbourne School of Land and Environment, the team is the first in Australia to accurately measure livestock emissions using laser and infrared spectroscopy systems.

Results show the average methane emission is much lower than estimates currently used in Australia, but the average ammonia emission is substantially higher.Chen says ‘you can only find ways to reduce greenhouse gases if you can reliably measure them’.

By sending a beam of light through the air, scientists can measure concentrations of methane, nitrous oxide and ammonia in the atmosphere.

The beams are bounced back from a reflector and the particles in that area detected. Emissions are then calculated using a computer model to work out the origin of particles in the air.The work has spurred new research into the use of inhibitors that can be applied to manure and soil to reduce emissions.

Preliminary results indicate emissions can be reduced by up to 80 per cent and the efficiency of nitrogen fertilisers significantly improved.

Chen's method involves measuring methane emissions using lasers and spectroscopy (file picture) Research Project Leader, Dr Ed Charmley, said, ‘The Australian Government’s Clean Energy Act sets a long-term goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent of 2000 levels by the year 2050.

'This research will help identify field-based measurement techniques and protocols that can support management actions and technologies that can help Australia meet such ambitious targets.’‘The Cluster will also develop science that supports methodology development for the Carbon Farming Initiative, an Australian Government program that enables farmers to earn ‘carbon credits’ for undertaking abatement activities on their properties,’ Dr Charmley said.CSIRO’s Flagship Collaboration Fund will fund the Cluster for over three years, with support from several other Australian universities including Macquarie University, RMIT Victoria, University of New England, University of Western Australia, and University of Wollongong as well as researchers at Agriculture and AgriFood Canada and the University of Alberta.nic devices more than their own toys.1
