Every year in the town of Nola, near Naples in southern Italy, hundreds of devout men willingly deform their bodies in the name of their religion.

The annual Festa dei Gigli, or Festival of Lilies, attracts thousands of visitors - many of whom come purely to watch local men carry eight 82 foot structures weighing 2,000lbs around the town.

The massive effort leaves them the men with horrific calluses on their shoulders - but far from hiding them away, the men show off their injuries as a symbol of their sacrifice and religious devotion.

Painful: Although deforming yourself in the name of religion may seem odd, the Festival of Lilies has been taking place in Nola, near Naples in southern Italy, for more than 1,500 years

Strong: The 120 local men who take part in the annual parade are known cullatori - which means 'cradlers'

Struggle: To make matters worse, local children and musicians climb on top of the handcrafted platforms as they are transported through the narrow back streets to Piazza del Duomo in the centre of Nola

Lining up: The Festival of Lilies always starts on the last Sunday before June 22nd and lasts seven days

Crowds: The annual Festa dei Gigli, or Festival of Lilies, attracts thousands of visitors - many of whom come purely to watch local men carry eight 82 foot structures weighing 2,000lbs around the town

Although deforming yourself in the name of religion may seem odd, the ceremony has been taking place in Nola for more than 1,500 years.

The men who take part in the June parade even have a name, cullatori - which means 'cradlers'.

The Festival of Lilies is dedicated to Saint Paulinus, who tradition states gave up his freedom and all his possessions to save the citizens of Nola during the Visigoth invasion of 410AD.

A festival celebrating Saint Paulinus' sacrifice is believed to have been held the same year, and proved so popular that it has continued for each of the subsequent 1,604 years.

This year the Festival of Lilies was finally given UNESCO protection status - meaning organisers now receive a small amount of money from the UN every year to ensure the tradition never dies out.

Pride: The huge effort leaves those taking part in the ceremony with horrific calluses on their shoulders. But far from hiding them away, the men show off their injuries as a symbol of their sacrifice and religious devotion

Motivation: Known as gigli - or lilies - the giant structures are carried to the sound of both religious music and traditional Neapolitan folk songs

Devout: The Festival of Lilies is dedicated to Saint Paulinus, who tradition states gave up his freedom and all his possessions to save the citizens of Nola during the Visigoth invasion of 410AD

Feeling the strain: Unlike many religious celebrations held in rural Italy, the tradition shows no sign of dying out. Record-breaking numbers of young locals apply to become one of the 120 cullatori each year

Old and young: A festival celebrating Saint Paulinus' sacrifice is believed to have been first held in 410AD, and proved so popular that it has continued for each of the subsequent 1,604 years

Masses: Thousands of tourists travel to Nola every June to watch the event and to cheer on the brave cullatori

The huge wooden structures the men carry as they take part in the parade each weigh 2,000lbs and are 82 foot long.

Known as gigli - or lilies - the giant structures are carried to the sound of both religious music and traditional Neapolitan folk songs.

To make matters worse, locals children and musicians climb on top of them as the handcrafted platforms are transported through the narrow back streets to Piazza del Duomo in the centre of Nola.

Esteemed photographer Antonio Busiello captured the striking images of the cullatori - with one of his images winning the gold medal for the Royal Photographic Society Print Exhibition in 2013.

Chair of the selectors Ray Spence said the image raises 'valid and contemporary questions about body image'.

Devotion: Antonio Busiello says he is proud to have taken his award-winning photographs and says he admires the cullatori's lack of vanity

Build: The huge wooden structures each weigh a staggering 2,000lbs and are 82 foot long

Major event: Teams of experts take several weeks to build the massive wooden structures every year

Status: This year the Festival of Lilies was finally given UNESCO protection - meaning organisers now receive a small amount of money from the UN every year to ensure the tradition never dies out

Parade: Although the ceremony celebrates the cullatori's strength and endurance, locals are eager not to forget that the Festival of Lilies is primarily a religious event, dedicated to the patron saint of the town

Busiello says he is proud to have taken the award-winning images of the cullatori, and says he admires their lack of vanity.

In an age where so many many of us are obsessed with looks and perfecting ourselves, the cullatori are happy to deform themselves for the sake of religion and tradition, he says.

'I was impressed by how proudly, despite 
the beauty standards of our time, they wear their huge calluses as 
symbols of their sacrifice and devotion to Saint Paulinus,' Busiello added.

The Festival of Lilies always starts on the last Sunday before June 22nd and lasts seven days.

Unlike many religious celebrations held in rural Italy, the tradition shows no sign of dying out.

Along with the new financial backing from UNESCO, record-breaking numbers of young locals apply to become one of the 120 cullatori each year.
