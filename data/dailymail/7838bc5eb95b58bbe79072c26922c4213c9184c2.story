The Catholic archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis in Minnesota has filed for bankruptcy protection  in wake of huge sex abuse claims.

Up to 300 estimated claimants have lodged complaints against church employees in the area with the majority of cases dating from the 1950s to the 1980s.

The total amount owed to victims tops $100 million according to the Associated Press, however the church has declared assets totaling ten to fifty million dollars. 

The lawsuits will be put on hold while the bankruptcy issues are resolved, giving religious leaders time to react accordingly.

Testing times: In a letter to parishioners, St. Paul and Minneapolis Archbishop John Nienstedt (pictured) said he ordered the bankruptcy as the fairest way to distribute the archdiocese's finite resources to victims 

The archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis posted a message to its website today stating: 'We must all come together to care for those who have been hurt during this tragic time in our church’s history.

'By filing for [bankruptcy], we are not avoiding our responsibilities, but recognizing them.'

St. Paul attorney Jeff Anderson suggested on Friday that the bankruptcy process could take about two years. 

The Catholic archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis connects 188 parishes, 91 schools and 825,000 members and a handful of charities.

It is the 12th U.S. diocese - out of around 200 nationwide - to seek such action in the face of sex abuse claims.

An attorney for the St. Paul and Minneapolis victims, Mike Finnegan, said the bankruptcy filing won't stop scrutiny of the archdiocese.

But church officials have 'promised to treat victims fairly during this process,' said Finnegan, whose firm is working with the archdiocese as part of an October settlement on child protection issues.

But Patrick Noaker, another victims' attorney, said he's disappointed. 

Noaker is handling a lawsuit scheduled for trial this month, and he said the bankruptcy filing robs him of the chance to reveal information that could help protect children in the future.

'The process of bankruptcy is not going to make kids safer,' he said. 'I don't think it's any accident that they filed a week before this trial was going to start.'

In a letter to parishioners, Archbishop John Nienstedt said he ordered the bankruptcy as the fairest way to distribute the archdiocese's finite resources to victims.

'This is not an attempt to silence victims or deny them justice in court,' Nienstedt wrote.

Minnesota lawmakers created a three-year window in 2013 for victims of past sexual abuse to file claims that otherwise would have been barred by the statute of limitations.

Since then, the archdiocese has been sued roughly two dozen times, and it has received more than 100 notices of potential claims, according to Joe Kueppers, the archdiocese's chancellor for civil affairs.

The mission of the church and its day-to-day operations will continue through bankruptcy, archdiocese attorney Charlie Rogers said. 

Parishes and schools, which are incorporated separately from the archdiocese's central office, should not be affected.

'It's a smart move on their part,' Pamela Foohey, an associate professor at Indiana University Maurer School of Law, said of the bankruptcy filing. 

'It ultimately can be useful for the victims taken as a whole, assuming that the diocese treats them fairly.'

Not all bankruptcy filings have gone smoothly. 

The Archdiocese of Milwaukee's bankruptcy has dragged on for four years as attorneys fight over who should get paid and how much.

But in Montana, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Helena sought protection only after working out a deal with victims. 

The deal was approved by a judge earlier this week.

The St. Paul and Minneapolis archdiocese does not have a pre-packaged plan for reorganization, but the archdiocese will try to avoid prolonged fights seen in other dioceses, Rogers said.

The archdiocese has already addressed issues that have bogged down other bankruptcies, including implementing a new system to protect children and disclosing thousands of pages of church documents and the names of accused priests.

As a result, Rogers said, this bankruptcy could focus purely on financial restitution to victims.

Finnegan, the victims' attorney, said the process also will allow victims to look at the church's finances, and allow the archdiocese and victims to pursue insurance companies.

Lachowitzer said he hopes parishioners see the bankruptcy filing as a necessary step to close 'a horrendous and tragic chapter in the life of the church.'
