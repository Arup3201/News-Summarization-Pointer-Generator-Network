Commons Speaker John Bercow is embroiled in a row over claims that a £200,000-a-year Westminster job is to be given to an Australian woman – even though a rival male candidate is better qualified.

Australian parliament official Carol Mills is favourite to succeed outgoing Commons Clerk Sir Robert Rogers, whose departure follows claims he was told to ‘**** off’ by Mr Bercow.

Ms Mills is one of two women on a shortlist of three, drawn up by a panel including Mr Bercow.

Shortlist: Carol Mills is allegedly the favourite to succeed Sir Robert Rogers at Commons Clerk

She flew to the UK to meet the Speaker and the rest of the interview panel – reportedly at taxpayers’ expense – and is due to be interviewed again.

Insiders at Westminster say Ms Mills, who is in charge of Australia’s Department of Parliamentary Services, is the strong favourite, despite claims the sole male on the list, David Natzler, is better qualified.

The third person on the list is a female Whitehall official.

A source said the hopes of Mr Natzler – Sir Robert’s deputy – had been hit because he is an Old Etonian, but added that he was of 'humble immigrant stock' who had won a scholarship to attend the school.

‘Natzler knows the job inside out, but the politically correct obsession of some people means the Aussie woman is the favourite,’ said a source.

‘Just because he went to Eton, Natzler is up against it, even though he got there by raw  talent and came from a humble background. It’s bonkers.’

Row: Sources claim Bercow has shunned her better-qualified rival because he is an Old Etonian

State-educated Mr Bercow made clear his view of the elite school when David Cameron became Conservative leader, saying, ‘Eton, hunting, shooting and lunch at White’s’ made him the wrong choice.

The Clerk of the House has traditionally been a constitutional expert promoted from within the ranks of Westminster officials, but Mr Bercow is believed to want a new-style Commons Clerk.

However, last night his friends said it was wrong to suggest  he favoured any candidate.

A spokeswoman for the Speaker said the final decision would  be based on the candidates’ qualifications, abilities and their performances at interview, but she declined to give any  details on individual applicants, saying they  were ‘confidential’.

She added: ‘The Speaker and the other members of the interview panel are keen to appoint the very best person for the job of Clerk.’
