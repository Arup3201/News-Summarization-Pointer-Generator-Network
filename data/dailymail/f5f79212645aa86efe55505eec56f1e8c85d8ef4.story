When Tony Pulis and Steve Parish toasted Crystal Palace’s momentous comeback against Liverpool in the manager’s office last season, they appeared to be a formidable partnership.

Pulis had rescued Palace, taking over when they had only four points and steered them to an incredible 11th-place finish. That night, after they had kept Palace in the Premier League, they spoke about their dreams for the future.

On Thursday night, after six hours of talks in a central London office, the pair accepted their relationship is unworkable.

It is incredible that it has come to this, less than 48 hours before their opening Barclays Premier League game of the season at Arsenal. Dave Kemp, Pulis’s assistant, will take charge for the Arsenal game, but will leave after the match. Coach Keith Millen, inherited from the previous management team, will stay on with Malky Mackay wanted to take over.

Reinforcements: Tony Pulis wanted to bring in the likes of (L-R) Gylfi Sigurdsson, Steven Caulker and Michu

This is a crisis, just three months after the ‘Miracle of Crystanbul’ and that incredible comeback to draw from 3-0 down against Liverpool.

Pulis wanted players — specifically Michu, Steven Caulker and Gylfi Sigurdsson — to help keep Palace up for another season. All three are on £40,000-plus a week and Palace are not used to spending big.

Where Eagles dare: Crystal Palace fans show their appreciation to Tony Pulis for keeping them up

They are awash with Premier League cash, with record profits last season, and were prepared to back Pulis with the biggest transfer budget in the club’s history. It is still there to spend.

But Pulis wanted to take charge of all the incoming transfers after the team responded to his methods when he replaced Ian Holloway. He gets results.

So, too, does co-chairman Parish. He is the former owner and chief executive of TAG, one of the world’s biggest marketing and communications agencies. Parish is one of four cautious co-owners, each with a 25 per cent stake and all Palace fans. They will not blow the budget.

Untenable: Palace owner Steve Parish and Tony Pulis once shared an excellent working  relationship

Two previous owners — Mark Goldberg and Simon Jordan — took huge risks in an attempt to turn Palace into one of the biggest clubs in the country. On both occasions, they ended up in administration.

Parish wants to redevelop Selhurst Park and Palace at his own pace but losing the manager is a massive blow. Pulis is immensely proud that he has never been relegated as a boss. He achieved something special last season, brought in after a disastrous start under Holloway. He is old school and this week, despite the fall-out with Parish, he continued to coach the team.

In the summer, when he spent time in Brazil commenting on the World Cup for BBC 5 Live, Pulis believed he could build a team to compete in the top half but needed to make big summer signings.

Instead, Palace have yet to make any significant additions. Right back Martin Kelly arrived from Liverpool for a cut-price £1.5m and Fraizer Campbell was signed as a squad player earlier in the summer.

Pulis wanted to strengthen the team in other areas as he prepared for his first full season in charge. Instead, before a ball has even been kicked, Palace are already looking for a new manager.
