More graphic testimony and harrowing photos of the homecoming gang rape victim's torn pantyhose added to the on-going court case against some of the accused high school students.

The trial in Richmond, California continued on Thursday with testimony given by a local crime scene expert, a detective in the case, and the third student who already accepted a plea deal and faces 27 years behind bars after admitting that he urinated on the victim.

The young woman, identified as Jane Doe in court, is now 20-years old but was 16 at the time of the October 2009 attack.

As many as 20 men are thought to have 
participated in the attack with one even answering the girl's cell phone
and telling her father how good his daughter was at sexual acts.

Showing the scene: Crime scene analyst Johana Estrada-Bellardo testifies in court about the torn pantyhose and high heel (pictured right) found at the scene, along with two opened condom wrappers

Questioning the questions: Detective Cary Brown was asked to describe the lead-in questions police used for the interrogations of the various students involved in the case

The criminologist talked about the DNA found on the torn pantyhose that was found at the crimescene strewn over one of the victim's discarded heels.

Two of the young men involved-Manuel Ortega and Ari Morales- agreed to plea deals and are serving 32 and 27 years, respectively.

Morales was the biggest draw of the witnesses heard in court on Thursday, as he was brought in from jail to testify against Jose Montano.

Both legal teams accept that Montano was on top of the victim at one point during the attack, but today defense attorneys were focused on trying to determine whether Morales clearly saw that Montano was raping the girl or miming an action.

His account: Ari Morales previously struck a plea deal and will spend 27 years behind bars after participating in the attack and urinating no the then-16-year-old girl

Testimony: He was brought into court on Thursday to talk about his recollections of Jose Montano's involvement

'Did you see his penis,' the attorney asked Morales at one point.

The exact wording of Morales' earlier conversations to police came up as a point of contention while Detective Cary Brown was on the stand earlier in the day.

He was asked about police methodology, and whether officers used leading questions, or pretended to side with the teen boys in an effort to gain their trust- and eventually a confession.

Mr Brown said that they did use similar tactics.

'Vile': Jose Montano, 22, (left) and Marcelles Peter, 20, (right) laughed about participating in a gang-rape on a 16-year-old girl after her homecoming dance in October 2009, a witness testified

On trial: Montano's attorney said while he witnessed the grisly attack, he had no part in it

In court: Peter initially said he was not at the crime scene, but later told them he only had a 'small role'

In one such case, Morales admitted to his role in the attack by saying he was 'just being stupid'.

Earlier
this week, the court heard from the girl's father, who received a 
taunting phone call from his daughter's cell phone mid-attack where one 
of the young men talked about how good she was at sexual acts.

The victim herself also testified, talking about the extent of the horrific actions and the moments before she blacked out.

She told the court she has a hazy memory of the attack but remembers getting kicked in the stomach and falling over.

Jailed: Ari Morales, left, who told the witness 
that he had urinated on the girl during the attack, and Manuel Ortega, 
right, and agreed to plea deals and are serving 32 and 27 years 
respectively

'Participants': John Crane Jr, 43, left, turned 
himself into police after the incident and Elvis Torrentes, right, faces
charges including aiding the act of rape that could land him in prison 
for 26 years

In chains: Earlier this week, suspects (from right) Elvis Torrentes, John Crane Jr. and Jose Montano walk to a preliminary hearing in Martinez. As many as 20 men are believed to have attacked the girl

'I
remember not seeing anything because my eyes were closed and I was 
holding onto my necklace and getting kicked in the stomach,' she said.

She
was repeatedly asked if she remembered drinking alcohol and said no, 
though the defense said this contradicted what she told police and 
medical staff after the attack. Nor does she have any recollection of 
the sexual assault or consenting to any advances.

Her
legs 'felt like somebody had ripped them out of place' and she felt 
nauseated, 'as if someone had took out my insides, stabbed them and put 
them back in', she said.

Graphic
pictures of her swollen face and bruised body were shown to jurors as 
she told them that to this day she still has scars on her back - the 
result of cigarettes being extinguished on her skin.

She
said she did not recall seeing Marcelles Peter that night and 'barely' 
recognized Jose Montano and only then because of his long hair.

The woman received $4 million from the West Contra Costa County Unified School District though a civil claim in the case.

The victim testified at the beginning of the third week of the trial.

Face off: Nearly four years after she was gang raped, the victim of the brutal attack took the witness stand for the first time to recount her memories before she awoke the next day in 'excruciating pain'

Horrific: Earlier in the trial, the jury was shown pictures of the injuries 'Jane Doe' sustained from the attack, which included cigarettes burned into her back
