A village cricket club has been hit for six after health and safety officials told it to stop using hard balls on its pitch during batting practice.

Bacton Cricket Club in Norfolk has been told that it can only use proper cricket balls for practice inside the cricket nets and not on the field as it has done for 37 years.

The new health and safety ruling has been drawn up Bacton parish council because of fears that members of the public could be hit and injured by stray balls.

But club officials have refused to agree to the new set of rules, governing the use of the Cubitt Memorial Playing Field in Bacton.

Club chairman David Gale said talks were now in place to move the team away from the village to a new base at nearby North Walsham High School.

He said: 'We are a cricket team - how are we supposed to practice without cricket balls? Are they expecting us to use tennis balls instead?

'It's upsetting - I've spent 10 summers nurturing the cricket square and you can really bat on it. The rules are untenable.'

Mr Gale said it was common for batsmen and bowlers at any club to practise outside of the nets, adding that the nets at the ground were of a poor quality.

The move will mean that club cricket will no longer be played in the village and the name of Bacton Cricket Club, established in 1934, will disappear.

'It's a sorry saga, and this is something
that the council really did not want to do. But they have to come to 
the table and adhere to the rules.'

The club which plays in the Norfolk Cricket League Division Six is now set to rename itself North Walsham Cricket Club.

The parish council is refusing to back down even though villagers have signed a petition in support of the cricket club.

The new rules for the use of the field state: 'Batting or bowling practice with a cricket ball or other solid or semi-solid practice ball must only take place inside the batting cage [nets]. Under no circumstances may this take place elsewhere.'

Council clerk Elaine Pugh said the rule was included in a complete set of new ground regulations to satisfy insurers' demands and protect people at the nearby bowls club, children on the play area and young people who also used the facilities during the week.

She said the rules were being enforced to 'protect the public' as there had been a couple of recent 'near misses' in which other people on the field had almost been hit by cricket balls.

Mrs Pugh said the council had other issues with the club including a mobile scoring hut being used without permission and concern about individuals being 'aggressive' at council meetings.

But she added: 'It's not a done and dusted deal. They can come and sit at the table and be polite and we can go forward from there.'

Mrs Pugh said the club has been written to at least 12 times, requesting information that they had to comply with and confirmation that they would agree to the rules.

She said: 'It's a sorry saga, and this is something that the council really did not want to do. But they have to come to the table and adhere to the rules.'

The council agreed last week that the cricket club's behaviour was 'unacceptable' and banned it from the field for the rest of the season.

But it agreed that the ruling could be reversed if to complied with the regulations.

Bacton Cricket Club honorary treasurer Ramone Stringer said: 'The parish council kept coming up with rules and regulations.

'This has been bubbling up for a long while. They wanted all our players to sign the rules and regulations, but they weren't happy.

'They said they didn't have the fixtures in time, and that the insurance details weren't up in the pavilion.'

'It's very sad for Bacton, which should always have a cricket club. But we're 99.9pc certain to move to North Walsham High School and change our name.

'The move will probably pay off, because North Walsham should have a cricket club and it will attract youngsters to play.'
