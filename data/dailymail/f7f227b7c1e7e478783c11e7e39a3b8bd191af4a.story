The amount of space junk orbiting earth has reached a 'tipping point' where continual collisions are thickening the already dense cloud shrouding the Earth, a Nasa report has revealed. 

In practical terms, it means that the amount of junk floating around the planet will make it increasingly difficult for spacecraft to leave the planet, effectively trapping us on earth.

It also poses 'potentially catastrophic risk' to astronauts, satellites and the International Space Station.

Since the first object, Sputnik One, 
was launched into space 53 years ago, mankind has created a swarm of 
perhaps tens of millions of items of debris.

The rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets, abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel.

It is estimated that there are 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in Earth's orbit.

The picture above shows a ball of twisted metal, thought to be fallen space junk, on a farm in Queensland, Australia, in 2008.

'We've lost control of the environment,' said retired Nasa senior scientist Donald Kessler, who authored the report.

There are 22,000 objects in orbit 
that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless 
more smaller ones that could do damage to human-carrying spaceships and 
valuable satellites.

It is estimated that there are as may
 as 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in Earth's orbit, traveling at
 speeds of up to 22,000 mph.

Several solutions to retrieving or 
moving the space junk were put forward in an earlier report called 
'Catcher's Mitt', by a Defense Department science think-tank.

It mentions giant cosmic versions of 
harpoons, nets, tethers, magnets and even a giant dish or 
umbrella-shaped device that would sweep up tiny pieces of debris.

While the new report does not recommend using the technology, Mr Kessler said it is needed.

He favours one private company's idea
 of a satellite that is armed with nets that could be sprung on wayward 
junk. Attached to the net is an electromagnetic tether that could either
 pull the junk down to a point where it would burn up harmlessly or 
boost it to safer orbit.

The latest evaluation report says: 
'Scenarios uncovered conclude that the current orbital debris 
environment has already reached a 'tipping point'.

'That is, the amount of debris... 
Currently in orbit has reached a threshold where it will continually 
collide with itself, further increasing the population of orbital 
debris.

'The increase will lead to 
corresponding increases in spacecraft failures, which will only create 
more feedback into the system, increasing the debris population growth 
rate.'

The report, Limiting future collision
 risk to spacecraft, was commissioned by Nasa last April to evaluate its
 programmes on 'space junk', officially known as MMOD (Micrometeoroids 
and Orbital Debris).

While it says that the current U.S. 
programmes have used their resources well, it notes that there was a 10 
year-plan between 1981 and 1991 to combat the problem, there has been no
 concerted effort since 1991.

It also warns that the proposals to 
begin tackling the issues are expensive and could be sidelined or 
underfunded in the current economic climate, despite the threat it poses
 in the future.

Since the space age began 54 years 
ago, civilization has littered the area just above Earth's atmosphere 
with leftover boosters and other parts that come off during launches, as
 well as old satellites. 

When scientists noticed that this 
could be a problem, they came up with agreements to limit new space junk
 and those plans had been working.

Those agreements are intended to make sure what is sent into orbit eventually falls back to Earth and burns up.

But two events in the past four years
 — a 2007 Chinese anti-satellite weapon test and a 2009 crash-in-orbit 
of two satellites — put so much new junk in space that everything 
changed, the report said.

The widely criticized Chinese test 
used a missile to smash an aging weather satellite into 150,000 pieces 
of 1cm debris and 3,118 pieces can be tracked by radar on the ground, 
the report said.

'Those two single events doubled the 
amount of fragments in Earth orbit and completely wiped out what we had 
done in the last 25 years,' said Kessler.

All that junk that means something has to be done, 'which means you have to look at cleaning space,' said Mr Kessler.
