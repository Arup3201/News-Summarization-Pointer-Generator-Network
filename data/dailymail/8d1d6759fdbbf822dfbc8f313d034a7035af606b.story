Alex Scott, who has been jailed for six and a half years, after conning passengers at Gatwick Airport out of £13,500 

A TV star police community support officer has been jailed after conning passengers at Gatwick Airport out of £13,500.

Mother-of-two Alexis Scott pocketed the cash when she told people coming through the airport that they were carrying too much money and ordered them to hand it over.

The scam was uncovered when returning passengers began asking airport officials for their money back.

The PCSO had featured in a 2011 documentary called Inside Gatwick where she was filmed talking proudly about her work.

But today Scott was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in jail after being convicted of theft at Canterbury Crown Court in July.

The sentence will mean that the 40-year-old will be separated from her baby daughter after judge James Mahoney said any jail term exceeding three years would see the mother and child split up.

Sentencing a sobbing Scott, of Plumstead, south-east London, the judge described the difficultly in striking a balance between public interest and what was best for the family.

He said: 'I have human feelings, I am a father.

'If it (the sentence) is more than three years the child is going to be taken from the mother. The judicial duty doesn't come harder.'

Members of Scott’s family broke down and left the courtroom wailing in distress as the judge handed down a sentence of six-and-a-half years for misconduct in a public office, and two-and-a-half-year terms for each of the six counts of theft, to run concurrently.

The judge also said Scott’s actions damaged the reputation of the police force and of this country.

He added: 'It was over a limited time that you did this but it was bold, persistent, systematic, planned and subtle.

'You preyed on [victims’] lack of sophistication and panic.

'This is a case about an official PCSO using her uniform and her status to commit serious criminal offences herself.

Scott was arrested in May last year after the scam, where she told passengers at Gatwick that they were carrying too much cash and needed to hand it over 

In 2011, the mother-of-two had featured in a TV documentary called Inside Gatwick, where she proudly talked about her work

'It is an exceptional and very usual case. The implication is upon the police, the public trust and the international reputation of this country.

'People from other parts of the world find themselves being fleeced by a police officer. If that’s the impression that people leaving this country go away with then that’s a very serious matter.'

Scott was arrested in May last year on suspicion of stealing more than £15,000 from seven victims.

She was convicted in July of six offences of theft and one of misconduct in public office following a three-week trial.

Scott was cleared by a jury of one count of theft. 

Her victims lost £13,500 in total, money which has now been paid back by Sussex Police.

Defending, Alexia Power said character references spoke of her client as a 'warm, kind-hearted woman who would do anything for others'.

Scott said being in prison with her baby, who was conceived before being charged, had 'kept [her] going'.

Miss Power added: 'The overwhelming picture from these references is that Miss Scott acted wholly out of character.

'She has brought up a young child, struggling with debt.'

The judge ordered Scott, who has no savings, to pay a nominal fee of £1. It means the full amount can be recovered as and when she accumulates it.

Judge Mahoney also praised members of the investigation team at Sussex Police for their work.

Following the verdict, Deputy Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney said Scott had fallen woefully short of the 'highest personal and professional standards' expected by Sussex Police, abusing the trust the force had placed in her and the trust of the public.

After internal disciplinary proceedings in July last year Scott was dismissed from her job, which pays a basic salary between £18,500 and just over £20,000 a year.

She had previously been a member of a specialist investigation team which confiscated cash from suspected criminals.
