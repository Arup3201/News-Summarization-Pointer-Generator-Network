Tributes have been paid to a football-mad college student who was stabbed to death in the early hours of today outside a London bedsit.

The 17-year-old became the second knife murder victim in London in the space of 14 hours after he was stabbed to death outside a bedsit in Palmers Green, north London.

The boy, named locally as Joshua Folkes, or 'Money J', as he was known to his friends, was pronounced dead at the scene after the emergency services were called at 12.45am.

Police, the London Ambulance Service and the capital's air ambulance attended the scene, a force spokesman said.

He said the teenager's family have been informed.

Formal identification is yet to take place and a post-mortem examination will be held in due course, the spokesman added.

Grieving friends broke down in tears as they paid tribute to Arsenal fan Mr Folkes, 17, when they visited the spot where he was murdered.

Reshe Hall, 17, said: 'He was such a nice guy. His name was Josh, but he loved money so we called him "Money J".

'He always said he wanted to do a lot of things, we never thought he would end here. His mother will be more than heartbroken. He was a really nice, charismatic guy.

'He was into football, his team was Arsenal. It is just so sad. He was never in a gang and never got into any big trouble.'

Mr Folkes is believed to have gone to Friern Barnet Secondary School, but had recently moved to Southgate Community College where he was studying to be a car mechanic.

Friends said the victim’s friend Marvin Henry, 17, was shot dead during a gang fight on an estate in Mill Hill, north London, in October 2010.

Investigations were being carried out at the scene in north London today following the incident

Kelsey Fashoni, 17, a close friend, broke down in tears as she visited the spot where he was stabbed.

Laying a bunch of red roses and white flowers and a card, she said: 'He was lovely, we all grew up together and he was the nicest boy.

'He was a friendly bloke, you couldn’t meet a nicer guy. He rapped and loved his football.

'The same thing happened three years ago. His friend Marvin Henry, who was known as Spooky, was stabbed to death. It is just another number to people. Its just so sad.'

One of the victim's close friends, who did not want to be named, laid a pair of trainers and a jumper belonging to Mr Folkes at the scene.

He said: 'I ain't feeling good at all, I ain't feeling good at all. He was my best friend. He got stabbed. He lived with me here a little bit, he stayed with me here a couple of times.

'I miss my friend, man, I miss my boy. That's all he was, man, I miss my boy.

'He was a good youth. He was a good youth at heart. He loved music, loved rapping. He loved to rap, that was his life.

'I miss my brethren, man. No doubt about it, I miss my boy. I miss my friend, we partied together, he slept in my house day and night.'

He went on to say: 'I miss my dawg, that's my right hand. I love my dawg, I miss my dawg.

'This made me realise what life is seriously really about. I lost someone close to me.

'He had a lot of friends around here. Josh has got a lot of friends, this is what people don't know.

'He lives in Brunswick with his mum, he loves his mum and he chilled with me in Palmers Green on like a daily basis.

'This is too much. He ain't got no brothers and no sisters, he was her only child that got taken.'

A neighbour of Mr Folkes has told how he arrived home in the early hours to see the teenager lying on the ground as a friend desperately begged him to get up.

Ali Bawan, 31, said Mr Folkes's eyes were closed, he didn't move and 'it was obvious he was dead'.

Mr Bawan said: 'I was coming home from work when I saw him lying on the pavement outside.

Teenager Joshua Folkes is the twelfth teenager to be murdered in the capital this year, but the first since September.

Seven of the teenage murder victims have been stabbed. Eight teenagers were murdered in London in the whole of 2012.

The latest incident was the second knife murder in north London in the space of 14 hours.

A separate murder inquiry was launched after a man in his twenties was fatally stabbed in north London yesterday morning.

Police were called shortly after 11.30am to reports of a man with stab wounds in Stoke Newington.

The victim was taken to an east London hospital where he was later pronounced dead.

Officers from the Met’s Homicide and Major Crime Command are appealing for witnesses. No-one has been arrested.

'I couldn't believe it. It was around 12.20am.

'There was another guy standing over him, his friend. He just kept shouting "Let's go! Let's go! Run! Let's go!" But he wasn't moving.

'He was sprawled out on his back with his eyes shut, although I didn't see any blood.

'The friend stayed until the police came.'

Mr Bawan said Mr Folkes had been staying in the upstairs flat of the run-down bedsit outside which he was stabbed.

He said there had been a lot of arguments and comings and goings from the flat.

He paid tribute to Mr Folkes who he said was 'a really nice guy'.

He said: 'He seemed absolutely a really nice guy. He's a very nice guy.'

Friend Vivian Fernando, 20, said: 'At about 12.45am the police and ambulance were all here.

'The paramedics had him open on the floor. I think it was internal bleeding. It was horrible.

'He was like a brother to me.

'Whoever it was, they need to do time because Josh wouldn't hurt anyone. He never carried a knife.'

Other mourning friends have left cards and flowers at the crime scene.

One card read: 'Rest in perfect peace and you be happy. I hope you're all right up there. Never forgotten'.

Another simply said: 'RIP Josh'.

There has also been an outpouring of grief on social media, with many of the victim's friends struggling to come to terms with their loss.

'I'm speechless, I'm shocked, devastated, confused?! how can this happen? WHY him?! R.I.P Money J,' one, identifying herself as Subliminal Dancer, posted to Twitter.

Meanwhile Azra Valentino, 18, said: 'He was such a good boy, he wasn't like that. He had the cutest smile.'

He went on to say: 'He wasn't meant to go like this. We're all just shocked. When I see this, I can't believe it really. I'm just shaken up. I don't know what to do.

'Josh was the last person who you'd think would be on the news for a death or something, he wasn't like that. He got caught up in it.'

Saffron Davis, 17, said: 'I've known him for 15 years. I still can't believe it. He went to Christ College. He introduced me to rap music, he listened to everything. I'm going to start crying.

'He was an only child. He had an uncle though, who he was really close to. I just feel for his mum.

'I think he was staying here with his girlfriends, his girlfriend was living here or something.'

A female neighbour, who didn’t want to be named, said: 'I heard a commotion outside the flat next to me, and then it went quiet.

'I looked outside the window and Money J was on the floor and he wasn’t moving.

'There was someone standing over him. They started doing CPR, they had to open his chest up.'

The neighbour went on to say: 'Then about eight or nine police cars turned up. They tried to do everything possible, but he was pronounced dead there and then.

'We knew him from around the area. He was staying with a friend.

'He was a good boy. His mum is going through the mill. She was tucked up in bed and then she gets a phone call saying her child is dead.'

A forensic tent today covered the spot where Mr Folkes died, while uniformed police officers stood outside the property.

There have been no arrests and police are appealing for anyone with information to contact them.
