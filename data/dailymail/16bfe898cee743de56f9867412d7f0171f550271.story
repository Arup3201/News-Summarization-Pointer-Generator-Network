Rihanna is just 'a heartbeat away from tragedy' because of a delusional stalker who may end up killing her if released, a New York City judge said Friday.

Judge Orlando Marrazzo compared stalker Kevin McGlynn to the man who murdered John Lennon as he denied the homeless man's release from a psychiatric hospital.

McGlynn, 54, was arrested last  July after hand-delivering letters to the pop star's Manhattan apartment in which he calls her a 'b****' and threatens to 'bum rush' and  gang rape her. He also believes he was in a relationship with Rihanna and that she stole his music.

History repeating? A judge on Friday compared Rihanna's stalker to the man who shot dead John Lennon in 1980. Rihanna pictured on the left attending the amFAR Gala in Los Angeles on October 29. John Lennon in New York signing autographs in 1980, four months before his death, on the right

John Lennon was shot dead outside his apartment building on the Upper West Side. The scene outside the Dakota building in the wake of the December 8, 1980 shooting 

Judge Marrazzo says McGlynn 'appears to be a ticking time bomb who is wholly fixated on (Rihanna), and poses a direct threat of serious physical harm or death to her and anyone around her.'

'It is entirely foreseeable that if he were free to continue to act upon his psychotic delusions without this court's intervention, it may result in the death of (Rihanna) or other innocent persons,' Marrazzo warned.

He went on to call McGlynn 'severely psychotic and delusional' comparing him to Mark David Chapman, the man who shot John Lennon outside the Dakota apartment building in New York, after asking for the Beatle's autograph. 

After he was arrested 'lurking' around Rihanna's apartment four months ago, McGlynn was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Staten Island, but later transferred to the South Beach Psychiatric Center. 

In September, he was found unfit to stand trail on the stalking charges. 

McGlynn will continue to be held at the facility as the 'least restrictive' means to treat his mental illness.
