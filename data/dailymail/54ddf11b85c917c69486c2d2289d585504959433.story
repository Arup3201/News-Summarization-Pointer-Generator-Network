Pentagon bosses are planning to develop puppy-brain scanning technology so they can spot the best dogs to train for the armed forces.

According to a new research solicitation from Darpa, the project, 
codenamed called FIDOS, for 'Functional Imaging to Develop Outstanding 
Service-Dogs' will use magnetic image resonator scans to look for 
puppies that show potential.

The project specifications say it will 'optimize the selection of ideal 
service dogs' by scanning their brains to find the smartest candidates, 
while 'real-time neural feedback' will help optimise training.

'This effort will capitalize on first-of-its-kind neural imaging feasibility work; demonstrating functional brain activation in unrestrained dogs in response to handler cues,' a document outlining the plan said.

'The objective of this effort is two-fold; first, to optimize the selection of ideal service dogs, both in operational military and therapy environments, and second, to use real-time neural feedback to optimize canine training, shortening training duration, reducing costs, and increasing learned responses.'

The new scheme will scan the brains of puppies such as spaniels, often used as sniffer dogs, to discover those most likely to excel in the armed services

Dogs are used throughout the US military, to sniff for bombs, detect drugs and even take part in advanced missions - such as the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden, where the unidentified canine was lowered into the compound from a 
helicopter while strapped to a human member of the team.

The Pentagon reportedly has about 2,700 dogs, most bought from Europe, where the best breeding lines for such work are generally based.

Each dog costs around $20,000 to train.

The agency believes it may be possible to use technology to screen 'high-value service 
dogs â€¦ based on their neutral activation to specific handler training 
cues,' Darpa said.

Dogs who show greater brain activity when given such
cues will be 'faster and easier to train' than dogs that show less 
activity.

The work could also help spot dogs suited for social tasks such as rehabilitation, it is claimed.

'Advances from this program could also be transitioned to the Veterans Administration, which is running a clinical trial on the impact of therapy dogs on the lives of veterans diagnosed with PTSD.

'Understanding the mechanism and communication between canine and human will facilitate therapy dog support for veterans with PTSD.'
