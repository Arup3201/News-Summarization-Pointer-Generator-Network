When it comes to winter tights, most of us settle for a 50-denier pair from Marks and Spencer.

But if you're looking to inject some serious Christmas sparkle into your look this December, these stretch-mesh tights embellished
with Swarovski crystals were made for you.

Created by Hedi Slimane at Saint Laurent, they first dazzled on the runway at his 
autumn/winter13 show.

Would YOU pay nearly £700 for a pair of tights? Saint Laurent have unveiled the ludicrously expensive Swarovski pair

But all that bling doesn't come cheap; these tights are probably the world’s most expensive 
hosiery at a staggering £688 a pair.

Made in Italy from nylon fishnet, they are 
very delicate and can only be hand-washed.

They are already a firm favourite of the fashion pack - just ask Edie Campbell who wore them in the September Issue of fashion bible, US Vogue.

Should you wish to splash out, stylist Courtney Smith has shared her top tips for pulling off the look.

She said: ‘If opulence and indulgence is your thing, then the Swarovski-studded tights will be right up your alley.

'The semi sheer black tights have been emblazoned with tiny crystal beading, and while I actually adore these and how delicate in style they are - I'd be hard pushed to spend quite that amount on something more often than not will get ladders.

'However, if you are splurging, this hosiery is your jewellery and tights all in one. Keep the outfit simple and team with a chic LBD or black playsuit and blazer.

'Avoid pattern; these tights will definitely be the talking point of your look. Just be wary of any nails, sharp objects or basically anything that might snag these...you may as well walk around with a sign saying "please don’t touch!"’.

If the tights alone aren't risque enough for you, take note from daring fashionistas Kate Moss and Lady Gag who have both wore the full see-through bodysuit version recently.
