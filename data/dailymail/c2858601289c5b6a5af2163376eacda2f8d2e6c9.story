Amanda Knox has claimed she is ‘proud’ of a string of one-night stands she had as a student and admitted that marijuana was her ‘vice’.

In her autobiography out tomorrow, Knox reveals that cannabis was ‘as common as pasta’ at the Italian apartment she shared with murdered  British student Meredith Kercher.

Miss Kercher, 21, who was living in Perugia as an exchange student, was found in her bedroom, semi-naked and with her throat cut, in 2007.

Amanda Knox spoke with ABC News' Diane Sawyer in New York. She has now revealed that she is 'proud' of having a string of one night stands and smoking marijuana at university

Knox, 25, and her Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 29, spent four years in jail until their convictions for Miss Kercher’s murder were overturned in 2011.

They are now facing a retrial after Italy’s highest appeals court quashed their acquittals last month.In Waiting To Be Heard, Knox recalls a life of drug use and casual sex as she travelled around Italy en-route to Perugia.

Her first one-night stand was with a man called Cristiano, whom she met on a train in Florence.She wrote: ‘We shared a joint, and then, high and giggly, we went to his hotel room.

‘I’d just turned 20. This was my first one-night stand. 

‘I’d told friends I couldn’t see myself sleeping with some random guy. But Cristiano was a game-changer.’

Two weeks after arriving in Perugia from her home in the US she had sex with an Italian named Mirko, who invited her back to his house for pizza. She says she later discussed this with her housemate Miss Kercher, a Leeds University student from Coulsdon, Surrey.

Knox wrote: ‘I was proud of myself for having a no-strings-attached consensual encounter but I felt awkward and out of place. I didn’t yet know if I’d regret it. 

‘Later I told Meredith about the sex and feeling “like an idiot”.

‘“Amanda”, she said, consolingly, “Maybe uninvolved sex just isn’t for you”.’

Knox later slept with ‘Bobby from Rome’, before meeting Sollecito a few weeks later at a classical music concert.

She says she found him ‘nerdy and adorable’ and recalled how, before they had sex for the first time, she told him that making faces made her laugh. 

She wrote: ‘We made faces until we collided in a kiss. Then we had sex. It felt totally natural.’

Knox was reportedly paid £2.5million by HarperCollins for the autobiography, which goes on sale tomorrow in the US, Canada and Australia.

The book will not be sold in the UK, reportedly because of  ‘libel fears’ surrounding the retrial and separate defamation cases in Italy against Knox and her parents.

Outside the murder scene: Knox says she was at Sollecito's apartment on the night of the murder, and was not in her Perugia home when Meredith was killed

In extracts published by the Sun newspaper, Knox describes how she and Sollecito bonded over their mutual love of cannabis.

Soon after meeting, Knox asked him: ‘Do you like marijuana?’, to which he said, ‘It’s my vice’. 

‘It’s my vice, too’, she replied.  Knox, who was in Perugia for the third year of an Italian, German and creative writing degree, said: ‘Around our house marijuana was as common as pasta. We all chipped in. It was purely social.’

Knox also describes how she became suicidal locked up in a women’s prison outside Perugia. 

She wrote: ‘I imagined myself as a corpse. It made me feel sick, not relieved, but it was a fantasy I had many times – terrible, desperate recurring thoughts that I never shared with a soul.’

She also recalled the sexual advances made by her cellmate Cera, who had the ‘tall, lean looks of a model’.

She said: ‘One morning I was walking into the bathroom to put something away, I bumped into Cera and she kissed me on the lips.’

Following their release from prison, Sollecito moved to Switzerland while Knox returned to Seattle to finish her degree at the University of Washington.

She has been in a relationship with classical guitar student James Terrano, 25, for 18 months.

Knox cannot be compelled by Italian law to appear at the retrial and might not face extradition for years, if at all. 

A third suspect, Rudy Guede, whose DNA and bloody footprints were found all over the crime scene, is serving a 16-year prison sentence for Miss Kercher’s murder.
