A couple who travel around Australia prospecting for gold and gemstones have captured the incredible moment an ant tried to steal one of their nuggets.

Walter Krikowa and his wife Liz, from Canberra, were on a recent gold hunting trip in the Kimberly in Western Australia when they came across the little insect making a getaway with their precious find.

Mr Krikowa, 60, dug a number of gold nuggets out of a sandy creek and had just returned to camp to show his wife what he had found.

The Canberra couple witnessed the tiny heist while on a prospecting trip in the Kimberly in Western Australia

But when he accidentally dropped one of the nuggets he turned around to pick it up, only to discover a meat ant was trying to steal it.

'He was a cheeky little bugger, wasn't he?' Mr Krikowa told Daily Mail Australia.

'I was pretty surprised, you hear about situations where they do take things back to their nest like garnets and quartz crystals, but you never think they go for gold.

'Maybe I should check a few ants' nests!'

When they realised what was happening, Mrs Krikowa quickly grabbed her video camera to capture the heist on film.

In the video the ant can be seen dragging the gold nugget with its two front jaws.

Mrs and Mr Krikowa run a construction company in Canberra but every winter they go prospecting for three to four months

During their recent trip the couple found over 300 nuggets, weighing approximately 9 ounces (255 grams)

They returned to Canberra last week after three and a half months on the road chasing gold and gemstones throughout Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland

Mr Krikowa said the ant was 'persistent', and in the film it can be seen taking a number of breaks before giving up and crawling away.

Mr Krikowa said the nugget weighed just under a gram and would have been several times the weight of the ant.

He added that he thought the ant had brought them luck.

'The next day we got a really good day and ended up with two ounces [of gold],' he said.

The couple run a construction company in Canberra but every winter they go prospecting for three to four months.

'Canberra gets freezing cold, and as soon as the first frost comes we're up north,' Mr Krikowa said.

'We're not professionals but I've been doing it for 50 years... I was only a kid when I started.'

During their trip they found over 300 nuggets, weighing approximately 9 ounces (255 grams) in total. The two biggest pieces they found weighed in at 20 and 38 grams.

They also found opals, Ribbonstones, Tourmaline crystals, Maltese Crosses and Zig Zag Amethysts.
