I was made a scapegoat... and Flower wanted a team of Boy Scouts

Kevin Pietersen has accused Andy Flower of ‘treating me like something stuck to the sole of his shoe’ from the outset of his reign as England coach.

The former England batsman is unsparing about his Zimababwean adversary in his book KP: The Autobiography, which was released on Monday.

Pietersen, who had sought to have Flower sacked as assistant coach at the same time as Peter Moores was first ousted, believes that the man who turned out to be England’s most successful supremo was a control freak who was after him from the beginning.

The problems between them began when Flower was appointed as caretaker successor to Moores on the England tour to West Indies in the early spring of 2009.

While insisting that he conducted himself as the model professional, Pietersen accuses his coach of ‘looking to pick a fight’ by demanding that he showed a look of greater interest when other people were talking at team meetings.

'With Flower it was always about control,' alleges the South-African born batsman. He accuses him of wanting to ‘neutralise’ him as the team’s most talented player and ‘keep me on the periphery until such time as he was ready to show me the door’.

Pietersen hits Flower, much respected by many others who played under him, with a stream of invective in the book, describing him as ‘contagiously sour’ and ‘infectiously dour’, saying that he was the kind of man who could walk into a room and suck the life out of it.

He calls him the ‘Mood Hoover’ and adds that the only time he felt really happy and appreciated in the England set up was under Duncan Fletcher and Michael Vaughan, who masterminded the 2005 Ashes triumph.

Pietersen details how Flower banned the traditional touring fines meetings on that tour of the Caribbean, when over a beer players would bond and tease each other about their shortcomings, because it made some of the management team uncomfortable. He puts this down, again, to Flower not feeling entirely in control of the situation.

While admitting that he occasionally saw glimpses of a Flower that he – and it should be said numerous others - found more appealing, he describes the coach as being ‘f***ing horrendous’ 95 per cent of the time.

It must be emphasised that plenty who played under Flower would disagree with Pietersen’s opinion of a man who won three Ashes series as a coach and showed tremendous personal courage in his stand against Robert Mugabe with Henry Olonga during the 2003 World Cup.

The antagonistic nature of their relationship is a thread that runs through the whole book as the batsman places the blame for many of his woes as an England player at the door of the Zimbabwean.

He does not rate him as a technical coach, and is very critical of the way he felt Flower allowed a group of bowlers to form themselves into a clique that alienated others, Pietersen more than anyone.

The hurt that the batsman felt over the Twitter account that continually teased him is something he believes that Flower should have stopped, and he connects the state of mind it put him in directly to the ‘Textgate’ incident involving Andrew Strauss.

He actually accuses Flower of trying to prolong the whole Textgate affair at one point, and describes the ‘torture’ that he thinks the management put him through as part of the reintegration process that led to him getting back in the team.

Another failing, he maintains, was allowing Jonathan Trott’s problems to get out of hand before he had to fly home from the disastrous Ashes tour in Australia. 

Pietersen believes that Flower was obsessed with his legacy being ruined by that dreadful winter, and was like ‘a deer in the headlights’ during the 5-0 drubbing.

Another crime of the coach was his closeness to Matt Prior, who also bears the brunt of his most coruscating observations. Graeme Swann, Nick Knight and, quite gratuitously, batsman James Taylor, are among others who do not escape the sharp end of his tongue.

The neediness of Pietersen does show through in some of this analysis, like when he got upset that Flower did not want to join Alastair Cook in having a beer to celebrate the batsman’s landmark of making 8,000 Test runs. He even accuses him of smiling on one occasion when informing the player that he was being dropped.

There was doubtless some blame on both sides, and Flower may want to give an equally comprehensive account of his version of events, which might differ considerably. It clearly goes way beyond the professional and is a very personal enmity.

For all their talents, achievements and attributes as people and cricketers, it is clear that these two were never destined to get on, to put it mildly.
