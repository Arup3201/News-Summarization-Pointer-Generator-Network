Fifteen bodies have been recovered so far from the scene of last night's rocket strike on a refugee convoy, says the Ukrainian military.

It is understood the convoy of buses and cars was packed with civilians fleeing heavy fighting between Ukrainian government forces and separatist rebels near Luhansk.

Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian military, told Reuters: 'By 7 p.m. last night we retrieved 15 bodies ... The search continued into the night and is continuing today.'

As the row over the refugee convoy attack intensified, Russia faced accusations of 'throwing new swarms of mercenaries and columns of military equipment' to back up rebels in east Ukraine.

New pictures showed Russian military units moving close to the border, as Ukraine's army continued making significant advances into rebel-held areas.

Kiev claims that some of this armoured hardware as well as Grad missile systems are crossing the border in support of the separatist cause, allegations strongly denied by Moscow.

But the Kremlin was making little attempt to hide its show of force in the Rostov region, which borders both Ukraine's Luhansk and Donetsk regions.

Some 13 trucks which were seen yesterday carrying tanks towards the border were today spotted empty and moving in the direction of the city of Rostov-on-Don, said locals in an area some 30 miles from the border.

There is no proof that the the tanks crossed into rebel-held Ukraine. But Dmitry Tymchuk, a Ukrainian military reserve officer and self-styled analyst, said rebel counter attacks had increasd 'in many directions'.

'There are constant attacks on our positions in the area of Savur-Mohyla. Fierce fighting is currently underway for the settlements of Yasynuvata, Makiivka, Zhdanivka, and others,' he claimed.

'And during this time, the Kremlin keeps throwing in more new 'Grads' to the border.'

Ukrainian government forces blame last night's attack on a refugee convoy on pro-Russian separatists they are battling in the area around the rebel-held city of Luhansk.

The rebels have denied responsibility. At least one rebel leader suggested no attack had occurred. 

The military said today many of those killed, who included women and children, had been burned beyond recognition. Many bodies had been blown apart by the blast.

The U.S. State Department condemned the attack on the convoy, which was near an area of heavy fighting between Khryashchuvatye and Novosvitlivka, but said it could not confirm who was responsible.

'We strongly condemn the shelling and rocketing of a convoy that was bearing internally displaced persons in Luhansk ... Sadly, they were trying to get away from the fighting and instead became victims of it,' State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told a news briefing in Washington.

News of the attack broke last night, with Ukrainian officials claiming that the victims of what was described as an artillery strike were burned alive after they were trapped in the vehicles.

Military spokesman Anatoly Proshin told Ukrainian news channel 112.ua: 'A powerful artillery strike hit a refugee convoy near the area of Khryashchuvatye and Novosvitlivka.

'The force of the blow on the convoy was so strong that people were burned alive in the vehicles - they weren't able to get themselves out.'

Colonel Lysenko said at a briefing last night: 'Many people were killed, among them women and children.'

A senior rebel leader denied his forces had the military capability to conduct such an attack, and accused the government of regularly attacking the area including with Russian-made Grad missiles.

'The Ukrainians themselves have bombed the road constantly with airplanes and Grads. It seems they've now killed more civilians like they've been doing for months now.

'We don't have the ability to send Grads into that territory,' said Andrei Purgin, deputy prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic.

Ihor Plotnitskyi, acting governor of the self-appointed Lugansk People's Republic (LPR), said the Ukrainian allegations the convoy was hit by a Russian supplied Grad missile were lies.

'I declare this fact is not a reality,' he said.

'The LPR army never shelled refugees or citizens' homes. No Grad unit was provided to us by Russia.

'All combat equipment is captured and was obtained in battles against the enemy.' 

But Tymchuk hit back, claiming: 'We are accustomed to the fact that the insurgents deliberately fire at the houses of local residents, at combat ambulances with the wounded, and use peaceful civilians as human shields.'

He labelled the alleged attack 'the apotheosis of savagery and villainy. This is the very essence of terrorism under the Russian flag.'

The road where the attack happened is likely to be the one that a convoy of Russian humanitarian aid would take if Ukraine allows it into the country.

Fighting across eastern Ukraine has forced nearly 344,000 people to flee their homes, according to UN figures.

The UN says about 155,800 have left for other places inside Ukraine while 188,000 have fled into Russia.
