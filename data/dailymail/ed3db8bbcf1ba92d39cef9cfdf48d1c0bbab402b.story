A string of rare and freakish fish have surfaced from Australian seas of late.

In the wake of the Goblin shark in New South Wales and the frill-shark in Victoria, another rare and peculiar fish has been stumbled upon in South Australia.

On Monday afternoon, a Riverland fisherman was taken aback when he netted a bony bream with two mouths.

Gary Warrick said: ‘the two mouths are actually joined together. The top one opens and closes while the bottom one stays closed'

Garry Warrick, a professional fisherman from Barmera, told Daily Mail Australia he had never seen anything like it in 30 years of working in the area.

‘It was very unusual. I have been fishing here for 30 years, and I have come across a few deformed fish, but never anything quite like this.’ 

‘The two mouths are actually joined together. The top one opens and closes while the bottom one stays closed. It’s amazing it was alive.’ 

He said he once caught a fish that had a dolphin shaped head. 

Warrick usually stores the deformed fish away for fertiliser, but this time he put it in the freezer and took some images which his wife uploaded online.

A group of fishermen got quite a shock when this pulled a terrifying prehistoric shark, known as the frill shark, from the water near Lakes Entrance in Victoria's east

Another extremely rare shark species, the goblin shark, was also recently caught off the coast of New South Wales to the amazement of local fishermen

In January, a group of fishermen pulled a terrifying prehistoric shark from the water near Lakes Entrance in Victoria's.

The eel looking creature, known as a frilled shark, was dubbed for its six pairs of frill-like gills along with its dorsal fins, similar to the predatory fish. 

Earlier this month, an extremely rare species of shark considered a 'living dinosaur' was uncovered off the coast of New South Wales to the bewilderment of local fishermen.

The species, known as a goblin shark, are incredibly elusive as they typically reside in waters near the ocean floor at around 1,200 metres deep. 

The creature was captured in a net by two fishermen, just 609 metres below the water's surface near Green Cape off the South Coast of New South Wales.
