Najat Hamza, Abu Hamza's wife, pictured, has been asked to leave her taxpayer-funded council house

Hate preacher Abu Hamza’s wife has been asked by her local authority to move out of the five-bedroom council house she lives in.

Moroccan-born Najat Mostafa is believed to live at the large Shepherd’s Bush property in west London with only two of the couple's eight children after reportedly moving there in 1995.

Hammersmith and Fulham Council says that in recent weeks it has corresponded with Mrs Mostafa and asked her to move to a 'more appropriate property'.

But the radical cleric's Hamza’s second wife is entitled to refuse the council’s request, as there is no time limit on her tenancy agreement.

News of the council’s request comes after Mrs Mostafa’s husband was extradited to the US on Friday after years of legal wrangling to face terrorism charges.

The 55-year-old will appear in court in New York today for a plea hearing.

A spokesman for Hammersmith and Fulham Council said: 'I can confirm that we have corresponded with Mrs Mostafa with regards to her tenancy.

'We believe this home is too big for the number of family members who currently live there and, with over 10,000 people languishing on the borough’s housing waiting list, she should move to a more appropriate property.'

Their demand comes after Greg Hands, the Conservative MP for Fulham
and Chelsea, told The Daily Telegraph: 'I would strongly welcome any 
move by the council to take a look at Hamza's wife's status and the 
large council house in one of London's wealthiest neighbourhoods to see 
whether something might be done to move Hamza's family on.'

The spokesman could not confirm the exact value of the property, but said house prices in Hammersmith and Fulham are among the most expensive in Britain.

Abu Hamza pleaded not guilty today 
to charges that he conspired with U.S. men to set up a terrorist 
training camp in Oregon state. 

He entered the plea shortly before U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest set an August 26 trial date for him.

Hamza is also accused of helping abduct 16 hostages, two of them American tourists, in Yemen in 1998.

Hamza, who is missing boths hands and an eye, never officially lived in the Shepherd's Bush house but was often seen there by neighbours before his arrest in August 2004 for incitement to murder and racial hatred.

In 2006 he was jailed for seven years. His wife moved into it in 1995 after claiming they had separated.

Police raided his council-owned house in 2004 and found thousands of extremist video and audio tapes ready for distribution.

In 2006 it emerged he had bought a four-bedroom semi in Greenford for £220,000 cash while in prison.

At the same time the Islamist extremist was running up a legal aid bill which had then cost the taxpayer £250,000, and the property was later seized to  claw back some of the cash.

Hook-handed Hamza first faced an extradition request from the Americans in 2004 and was jailed in the UK in 2006 for seven years for soliciting murder and inciting racial hatred.

The former firebrand imam of Finsbury Park mosque has been charged with 11 counts of criminal conduct related to the taking of 16 hostages in Yemen in 1998, advocating violent jihad in Afghanistan in 2001, and conspiring to establish a jihad training camp in Bly, Oregon, between June 2000 and December 2001.

Last week Hammersmith and Fulham council announced it is ending lifelong council houses tenancies and from April 2013 will only offer fixed-term tenancy agreements of two years or five years.

New tenants will have to show that they have made a contribution to the community and demonstrate a five-year connection to the borough.

The new measures will not affect existing tenants such as Mrs Mostafa.
