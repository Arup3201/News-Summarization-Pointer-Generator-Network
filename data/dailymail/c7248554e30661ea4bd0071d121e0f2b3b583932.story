Two former students at British universities are among those missing following the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, it has emerged.

One, Huan Peen Chan, 46, studied engineering and computing at the University of Sunderland between 1992 and 1995, while Yue Wenchao, 26, went to Hull University Business School.

Popular Mr Chan - known as Jesse - played the church organ at Sunderland Free Church while he was a student in the city.

Missing: Mr Chan was one of 239 people on board flight MH370, which vanished on March 8

Following his return to Malaysia, friends he made in the UK would regularly visit him and his wife Janet, and children Xanthus and Lukas, in Kuala Lumpur.

Church pastor and close friend John Cropley, 66, said: ‘When we heard that Jesse was onboard, we felt a combination of disbelief and shock but knew his faith would remain strong.

‘At present we still want to cry with sadness at the thought of what Janet and the children are going through, her pain must be intense - the unknown is much more frightening as we are all left to the mercy of our imagination.

‘Jesse is a very gentle and humble person, with an infectious smile and the ability to paint pictures with his music. He was never grumpy, always the same and you could depend on him - just a gentle soul.

‘He became, and remains, a very close friend to my wife and I and many others in Sunderland.’

A spokesperson for the University of Sunderland said: ‘We are deeply concerned to hear reports that one of our graduates, Huan Peen Chan may be one of the passengers on board the missing Malaysia Airlines plane.

‘Although we are not able to confirm these reports at this time, we wish to pass on our thoughts to the family at this difficult time.’

Jesse, an engineer at Malaysian business Freescale Semiconductor, was among 26 of the company's employees who were onboard the flight. 

Yue Wenchao, of University of Hull Business School, had written ‘see you in Beijing’ next to a photo of his girlfriend on a website an hour before he boarded.

The agency co-ordinating the 
exhaustive search operation for MH370 still holds out hope of finding 
people alive, as authorities scramble to cover the massive 600,000 
square-kilometre (230,000 square-mile) search area.

The
 Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) revealed on Friday that 
they were preparing for the remote possibility of a human rescue 
mission, should the two large objects spotted by satellite some 2,500 
kilometres (1,500 miles) off the coast of Perth be related to the 
missing Malaysian Airlines flight.

John
 Young, the general manager of AMSA's Emergency Response Division, said 
the focus of the massive search operation - which now includes 29 
planes, 21 ships and six helicopters from more than 20 contributor 
countries - was first and foremost on trying to locate the large pieces 
of debris, one up to 24 metres (78ft) in length, the other five metres 
(16 feet).

'We want to find these objects because they might be the best lead to where we might find people to be rescued,' Mr Young said.

'We have done some work on that area and we're still focused on that task, to find people to be rescued.

'It is a very large team effort... 
with the international community providing technical support and 
information and we're all very grateful for that.'

The
 two objects are in one of the most remote areas of the world - about 
the same distance from Perth as London is from Moscow - which means that
 aircraft only have a limited time to conduct searches.

And it takes them four hours to get there.

What's more, the area is renowned for shipping debris - so much so that it's dubbed 'the maritime dustbin'.

There is a strong chance, therefore, that the objects in fact fell off a ship.

Australian
 Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who announced news of the objects on 
Thursday, warned: 'It could just be a container that has fallen off a 
ship. We just don't know.'

Treacherous weather hampered 
Thursday's search effort, but the operation resumed on Friday in much 
clearer weather, with planes scouring an area slightly to the north of 
the zone that was combed initially.

This is because strong currents may have moved the objects.

'It's
 about the most inaccessible spot that you can imagine on the face of 
the earth, but if there is anything down there, we will find it,' Mr  Abbott told reporters in Papua New 
Guineau, where he is on a visit.

'We owe it to the families of those people (on board) to do no less.'

The
 pilot from the first RAAF P3 Orion to return from its second sweep of 
the search area told a press gathering at Pearce RAAF air base: 'We've 
got a lot of hope.'

'We got out there and had really good weather,' he said.

'Compared to yesterday the visibility was great, more than 10km visibility, we had a really opportunity to see.

'There are more aircraft out there, still searching, and with any luck we'll find something shortly. We've got a lot of hope.'
