A mother-of-two who was also a senior insurance executive and triathlete was found stabbed to death in the chest in Connecticut on Thursday.

The body of Melissa Millan, 54, was found on a bike path where she had been jogging in Simsbury, according to police.

Family and friends gathered on Sunday to hold a vigil in her memory at the spot where candles and dozens of bouquets of flowers have been placed.

Another vigil was held earlier on Sunday in Farmington sponsored by her triathlete group, Team Training New England.

The organization's website called Millan an ‘an extraordinary human being’ and set up a memorial page for her.

‘Melissa has been a pillar of the TTNE community since she first trained with us in 2006. Regardless of her formidable responsibilities at home and at work, she made every effort to mentor 'newbie' triathletes and provide moral and other support to her team members year in and year out, without fail!' the website said.

A married mother-of-two, Millan was also a senior vice president at MassMutual in Springfield, reports WFSB.

A spokesman for the company said she was a tremendous leader and deeply caring and that she would be missed.

Passing motorists found Millan lying on the ground Thursday at 8:04 p.m., according to Simsbury police.

Police said she could have been out jogging but that they did not yet know what happened and are investigating.

Millan was taken to St. Francis Hospital where she died, according to police. 

On Saturday, police scoured a nearby trail for evidence, but said nothing new was found and they are still searching for the weapon.

The case is being investigated as a homicide and police are still on the hunt to find the person responsible. No arrests have been made.
