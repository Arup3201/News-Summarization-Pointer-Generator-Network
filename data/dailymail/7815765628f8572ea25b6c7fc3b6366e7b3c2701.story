The badly decomposed bodies of a Brazilian family have been found in their home in Sao Paulo near to a message scrawled on a wall which read: 'God forgive me. I couldn't look after my children'.

Neighbours became concerned over the weekend when they noticed a strong odour coming from the proerty in Cotia. The family had not been seen since last Friday. 

When police broke into the three bedroom home they discovered Claudine Pedrotti Junior, 39, his wife, Suelen Cristina da Silva, 26, and their two children, Victoria, two and Peter Henry, seven, lying on the same bed in the main bedroom.

The message had been written in crayon on a kitchen wall.

Four dinner plates, still with food, were set out on the kitchen table showing how the family sat down to eat their last meal before they died.

Police suspect the phrase was written by the father before he killed himself and his family.

Investigators suspect that one or both of the parents in collusion used poison. 

Dr. Joaquim, a coroner from the Institute of Criminology of Taboão da Serra, Sao Paulo, said there was no evidence of violence. 

He reported that there were small pools of blood near the bodies but no traces of gunshots or bullet wounds.

Shock: Neighbours stand outside the house where the family were found dead in Sao Paulo

Investigators have been collecting evidence at the crime scene where the badly decomposed bodies of a family were found

Neighbours of the couple told police they heard the family's car engine running inside the garage in the front of the house

After carrying out an initial investigation of the scene he concluded that 'it could be a case of poisoning.' 

Investigators said they found no firearms in the property.

Both husband and wife worked as hairdressers and ran their own salon in Santa Maria Jardim about 21km from where they lived.  

According
to a relative the family was facing serious financial difficulties and 
Pedrotti Jnr had complained about their problems a fortnight before.

The electricity was about to be cut off and they were behind with their rent in both their house and their business.

A next door neighbour, close to tears, said the family were friendly and well-liked in the community adding: 'This is a real shock for everyone, particularly with the death of the children.

'We just don’t understand why this has happened.'

Police suspect the father may have agreed with his wife to poison the children and taken their own lives because of their financial difficulties.  

Dr Andreas Schiffmann, forensic investigator, said: 'Our main task now is to discover exactly what happened here and what is the cause of the murder and the suicide.

'Everything leads us to believe that they used the poison called "chumbinho"', he added.

Otherwise known as veneno and nicknamed ‘BB’ in Brazil, the poison, which comes in the shape of small pellets, is used in pesticides mainly to kill rats. 

Once ingested by humans or animals the victims suffers sharp stomach pains leading to vomiting. The poison damages the immune system, cells and tissues, causing death within minutes.

Investigation: Police leave the home where the family were found dead on Sunday in Sao Paulo

Neighbours of the couple told police that on Friday at around 11pm they heard the family’s car engine running inside the garage in the front of the house.  

The family did not appear again. Around 9am on Sunday locals complained of a strong stench coming from the family's residence. 

At first they thought it was rotting garbage.

'The smell coming from the house was not good and we didn’t know why that was,' explained a resident. 

'At first we thought it was the smell of rubbish. But then we noticed there was no movement inside the house and it was all closed up.  So we became really concerned and decided to try to find out.'

A local boy was asked to climb up to the window ledge and look inside the house by one of the neighbours. 

Based on initial reports, police believe Claudine killed Suelen and her children with poison then killed himself

Peering through the window into the master bedroom the boy said he could see the bodies of the family lying together on the bed.

The boy, who has not been named, broke a pane of glass to check what had happened, then warned the neighbour. He said he did not dare look at the corpses because they were already in an advanced state of decomposition. 

When police arrived at the scene, they had to break down the front door of the house because it was locked. The door to the main bedroom was also bolted and they had to force their way in. 

The four bodies were found lying on the bed. The father was lying on his stomach, his left arm cuddling the daughter with the son lying beside his sister. On the father's right, lay the mother also on face down.

In the kitchen the police found what they believe was a suicide note written on the wall in coloured crayon.  

'I could not take care of my children,' the message said. Experts took away the plates with the food and a bottle of soda for further analysis. 

On the cooker, the remains of rice, beans and some meat were still in the saucepans. Autopsies on the bodies were being carried out on Monday.

In Brazil around 25 people a day commit suicide.  

Between 1998 and 2008, government figures show the total number of suicides in the country increased by 33.5 per cent, higher than the number of murders and the number of deaths from road accidents. 

In Brazil, suicide is now categorised as the third leading cause of death, a high proportion of them, according to researchers, is as a result of depression or from some form of mental disorder.
