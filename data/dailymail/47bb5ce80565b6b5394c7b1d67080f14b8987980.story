Hector Bellerin's remarkable rise this season has been a surprising, but important component of Arsenal's recent form, and the Spanish youngster says it justifies leaving Barcelona.

Bellerin has played 19 times for the Gunners this season because of injuries to Mathieu Debuchy and Calum Chambers, his first taste of top-flight football since joining from the Catalan club as a 16-year-old.

And the full back admits he might never have been handed top-level football if he'd stayed in Spain rather than travelling to North London.  

Hector Bellerin has stressed that he was right to leave Barcelona at the age of 16 to join Arsenal

Injuries have seen the Spanish defender play regularly at right back this season for the Gunners

'I got the chance and I took it', he told Spanish paper Marca.

'Wherever you are, you have to work. If I'd stayed at Barcelona, I don't know if I'd have made it to the elite, you just never know.

'I've worked as hard as I could and always had the mentality of reaching the top. Whether I was in one place or another, I'd have done the same.'

Although he knows breaking through at Barca would have been tougher than in the Premier League, Bellerin refused to accept that English football is that far behind La Liga, despite our teams' failure in the Champions League this season.

Bellerin was on loan at Watford last season, but is now a Premier League regular under Arsene Wenger

'A lot of people in Spain watch Premier League games and know what kind of a league it is, he added. 'It would be madness to say that it isn't among the best leagues in the world.

'The Spanish league is also at a very high level, with Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico. In the Champions League maybe we should have done things better. Perhaps we underestimated Monaco.'
