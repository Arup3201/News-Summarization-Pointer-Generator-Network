Team news

West Brom

West Brom's record signing Brown Ideye is in contention to make his competitive bow for the club in their Barclays Premier League opener against Sunderland on Saturday, but fellow summer recruit Joleon Lescott will miss out as he continues his recovery from a knee problem.

James Morrison (knee) is also not available for the game at The Hawthorns, while it remains to be seen whether Gareth McAuley (calf) will be ready to feature.

Along with Ideye, a host of other players signed over the summer - including Andre Wisdom, Chris Baird, Jason Davidson, Sebastien Pocognoli and former Black Cats man Craig Gardner - could be involved in what will be head coach Alan Irvine's first competitive fixture with Albion as well.

Provisional squad: Foster, Myhill, Wisdom, Olsson, Baird, Davidson, Pocognoli, McAuley, Dawson, Yacob, Gardner, Brunt, Dorrans, Mulumbu, Ideye, Anichebe, Berahino, Sessegnon.

Sunderland

Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet will be without Emanuele Giaccherini and Billy Jones for Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to West Brom.

Italian midfielder Giaccherini is out with a groin injury, while former Baggies defender Jones will be denied a competitive debut for his new club by a hamstring problem.

Poyet faces a major decision over his goalkeepers with new arrival Carlos Pantilimon challenging Vito Mannone for the number one spot, while there could be debuts for Patrick van Aanholt, Jordi Gomez and Will Buckley.

Provisional squad: Mannone, Pantilimon, Van Aanholt, Brown, O'Shea, Vergini, Cattermole, Bridcutt, Rodwell, Gomez, Larsson, Johnson, Buckley, Mavrias, Wickham, Fletcher, Altidore.

Key Match stats (supplied by Opta)

West Bromwich Albion’s last four opening day fixtures have produced 13 goals.

Gus Poyet will be the fourth different manager Sunderland have had on the opening weekend in the last four seasons and fifth in the last seven.

The home team has won each of the last three clashes between West Brom and Sunderland.

Stephane Sessegnon has scored in two of the last three league meetings between these two teams, once for each side.

Vito Mannone (77.4 per cent) had the best save percentage rate of any goalkeeper in the 2013-14 Barclays Premier League.

Last season Sunderland became only the second team to be bottom on Christmas Day and avoid relegation (after WBA in 2004-05).

Sunderland claimed as many points in their final six games as Liverpool and Chelsea in 2013-14 (13).

No team won fewer games than West Brom in the 2013-14 Premier League season (seven, level with Cardiff).

West Brom took part in three of the six games to end 3-3 in the 2013-14 Premier League season.

If only away games had counted last season, Sunderland would have finished in the top half (10th).
