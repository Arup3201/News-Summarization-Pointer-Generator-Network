Think your morning commute is bad? Spare a thought for your fellow commuters in Istanbul, which has just been crowned king of the traffic jam.

Turkey's largest city has the most congested streets in Europe, according to new research.

Other major traffic hotspots are Warsaw in Poland, Marseille in France and Palermo and Rome in Italy.

Choked: Beneath the beauty of Istanbul lies bumper-to-bumper traffic

Meanwhile, British cities compared favourably to rush hour cities on the continent.

The combination of sky high petrol prices and traffic measures like the congestion charge in London has helped cut the number of drivers in many city centres, said satnav firm TomTom in its quarterly Congestion Index.

Leeds-Bradford is the most congested conurbation in the UK yet only sits 17th in the top 60 European cities that suffer the most during their peak rush hours.

TomTom monitors millions of traffic journeys a year to compare the percentage change between non-peak times and rush hour to compile its hotspot list.

Istanbul is the worst for jams as its peak time is 57 per cent more congested than its non-peak times.

In April the city suffered its longest 
traffic jam in recent memory, lasted for a steering wheel-smashing 72 
hours on the Ataturk Bridge.

Top Ten Cities for Congestion (% busier at peak times than during non-peak times):1.Istanbul (Turkey) - 57% 2.Warsaw (Poland) - 45%3.Marseille (France) - 40%4.Palermo (Italy) - 40%5.Rome (Italy) - 34%6.Paris (France) - 34%7.Stuttgart (Germany) - 33%8.Brussels (Belgium) - 32%9.Hamburg (Germany) - 32%10.Stockholm (Sweden) - 30%

...and the ranking of British cities in the European list:1.Leeds/Bradford - 27%2.London - 26%3.Nottingham - 24%4.Manchester - 22%5.Birmingham - 20%6.Sheffield - 20%7.Newcastle-Sunderland - 20%8.Liverpool - 20%9.Glasgow - 17%

Poland's capital, Warsaw, is in second place with a 45 per cent increase and Marseille is in third with a 40 per cent leap, narrowly ahead of Palermo in Italy.

The top ten includes capitals Paris and Rome, both notorious for the constant stream of traffic in the city centres, plus German industrial towns Hamburg and Stuttgart.

The top 60 includes nine British cities but only two are in the top 20, Leeds-Bradford and London.

Other British cities to feature in the congestion index include Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield along with Newcastle-Sunderland, Nottingham and Glasgow.

A spokesman for TomTom said: 'Whilst cold, ice and snow were an important cause of extra congestion in the UK in the first quarter of the year, rainstorms played a major role in April, May and June.

'April to June were some of the wettest months on record.  This has a major influence on road speeds.

'We also saw some major construction projects causing traffic delays, such as the development of New Street rail station in Birmingham and the temporary closure of Liverpool Central station. 

'Other recurring causes include insufficient road capacity compared to demand, and ineffective management of that road capacity.'

Really?: British cities were better for congestion than many of their European counterparts, with only Leeds (left) and London (right) in the top twenty
