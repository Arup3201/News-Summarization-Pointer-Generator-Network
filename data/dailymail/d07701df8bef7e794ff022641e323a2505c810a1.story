The family of a 29-year-old man from Chicago are waiting to hear what caused his sudden death during a cruise with his wife and four children.

John Perricone and his family were enjoying a vacation to Mexico last month, which had been a gift from his parents, when he started to have trouble breathing.

He visited the ship's doctor on February 20, a day after feeling unwell, but while there the father of four young children began to convulse before suddenly dying.

The family of the Home Depot department manager are now waiting to receive the results of the autopsy as they struggle to come to terms with his death.

Family man: John Perricone enjoyed spending time with his four children

Mr Perricone, who was studying for an accountancy degree at night school, was the sole breadwinner for the Romeoville family, as his wife Brittany cared for their children, all under the age of seven.

A fund-raising page has been set up in his memory, for the funeral arrangements and to help with his children.

Because the family had been struggling to make ends meet, Mr Perricone had canceled his life insurance at the end of last year, believing there was little that could go wrong while he was 29.

The Romeoville family had been off the coast of Cozumel, Mexico, when Mr Perricone went to see the ship's doctor.

'The next thing you know, he started 
convulsing real bad and looked at my daughter with the biggest "I'm 
sorry" eyes, and he went limp,' Lee Forseth, his father-in-law said.

Mr Perricone's sister, Katie, who was also on the cruise, told NBC Chicago her brother had been tired on the vacation and sleeping more than usual.

No other illnesses were reported on the cruise, and Carnival has said it does not suspect foul play.

The father-of-four's body is being examined in New Orleans, before being returned to Mr Perricone's hometown in Chicago.

Mr Perricone was described as a family 
man who worked hard, and was the sole provider for his wife and four 
children, Grace, 7, John, 4, Charlie, 2, and Mark, who just had his 
first birthday.

Unexpected: John was on vacation when he started to struggle to breathe

'He had everything under control, and I didn't have to worry,' Mr Forseth told the Chicago Tribune. 'And neither did his family. And neither did my daughter.'

The fund set up to help Mrs Perricone and her children has already raised more than $22,000.
