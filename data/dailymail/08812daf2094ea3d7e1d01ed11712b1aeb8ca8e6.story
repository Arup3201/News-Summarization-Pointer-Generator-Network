Authorities say an Arizona school math teacher showed up to class drunk and continued drinking throughout the day.

Pinal County Sheriff's officials say students at Poston Butte High School in San Tan Valley called the main office Wednesday after 57-year-old Kathleen Jardine began cursing at them.

A responding deputy says Jardine eventually admitted that she had drank the night before, that morning and during lunch in her classroom.

Drunk mathematics: Kathleen Jardine, 57, was allegedly drunk in class at Poston Butte High School where she cursed at pupils before they reported her behavior to officials

Stash: A staff member found a half-empty bottle of vodka, an empty single-serve wine bottle and a bottle of SunnyD

The deputy says the math teacher had a blood alcohol concentration level of .205.

According to AZ Central, she told school officials that she'd been too drunk to drive to work in the morning.

Second incident: In 2011, Jardine was dismissed from her position at a New Mexico school for drinking on the job

'I was afraid I was too intoxicated to drive so I took a cab this morning,' she reportedly said.

A
 school resource officer found a half-empty bottle of vodka, an empty 
single-serve wine bottle and an orange-flavored drink in Jardine's 
purse.

Jardine, of Chandler, was cited for one count of consumption of alcohol in public but could face disorderly conduct charges.

Jardine was fired in 2011 from a school in New Mexico over a similar incident.

In that instance, she taught her class while drunk for five hours before students complained that she was behaving strangely and slurring her speech.

Florence Unified School District officials declined to comment, citing it as a personnel issue.

Jardine was released into the custody of her daughter as officials continue to investigate.

'Learning math can be hard enough, I canâ€™t imagine trying to learn it from a drunk teacher,' said Sheriff Paul Babeu.

Florence Unified School District superintendent Dr Amy Fuller released a statement about the incident, praising students who reported the teacher and staff who quickly removed her from the classroom.
