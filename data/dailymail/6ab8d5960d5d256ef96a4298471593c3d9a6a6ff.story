Brazil edged out Chile on penalties in a dramatic last-16 World Cup game.

There was nothing to separate the sides after 120 minutes of play, but Luiz Felipe Scolari held their nerve to win the tie in a dramatic shootout.

But how did the players get on individually? MATT LAWTON gives his ratings:

BRAZIL

Julio Cesar: 7

Not much chance of stopping Chile’s goal but a great second half save to keep Brazil in the game. 

Beaten: Julio Cesar lays forlorn as Alexis Sanchez scores for Chile

Daniel Alves: 5

Tested Claudio Bravo with a vicious shot and covered the hard yards but not his best game.

Thiago Silva: 7

Got the vital flick-on for Luiz’s goal and a strong defensive display.

David Luiz: 7

Hugely important goal and what a celebration and stood firm in central defence.

Ferocity: David Luiz celebrating his opening goal for Brazil

Marcelo: 6

At times lacked positional discipline but a solid performance all the same.

Fernandinho: 6

Wasted no time making his presence felt with a late challenge on Aranguiz but ran himself into the ground before limping off.

Luiz Gustavo: 6

A commanding presence in midfield and protector of the back-four, often sitting as deep as the centre-halves.

Enforcer: Luiz Gustavo challenging Arturo Vidal in midfield

Oscar: 6

Not his best performance at this tournament. Kept pretty quiet by strong Chilean defending.

Neymar: 7

Showed explosive pace on the ball and some marvellous skill – not to mention bags of energy - but didn’t take his chances this time.

Poster boy: Neymar fighting for the ball with Chile defender Mauricio Isla

Hulk: 6

Dreadful mistake for Chile’s equaliser and a booking for that controversial disallowed goal. But terrific too at times.

Fred: 5

Missed what chances came to him and replaced midway through the second half by Jo. Says it all really.

Disappointing: Fred had a disappointing game before being subbed off

CHILE

Claudio Bravo: 7

Some mad moments but did his job, including some quite stunning saves.

Gary Medel: 6

Looked stretched at times but a courageous display by the Cardiff City man.

Rock: Chile defender Gary Medel was excellent at the back

Francisco Silva: 6

Did well, in partnership with Isla, to marshall Oscar.

Gonzalo Jara: 6

Picked up a booking that meant a suspension and struggled at times with Hulk’s strength and power.

Mauricio Isla: 6

Like Silva did a good job making like difficult for Brazil as a right-sided wing-back.

Battler: Mauricio Isla challenging for the ball with Brazil's Neymar

Eugenio Mena: 6

Booked and therefore also knew he would be out of the next game. But worked tirelessly.

Marcelo Diaz: 6

Coped well in the midfield battle zone against quality opposition.

Arturo Vidal: 7

What a good player the Juventus man is. Seemingly can play anywhere too.

Acrobatic: Chile and Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal goes for a fly kick

Charles Aranguiz: 6

Crunching tackle on Neymar in the opening exchanges.

Eduardo Vargas: 7

His ball for the equaliser was superb and defended from the front.

Alexis Sanchez: 8

Marvellous goal. His 10th in 14 international matches. If Liverpool can get him they really should.

Joy: Alexis Sanchez celebrates his opener
