[Honest: Simon McCoy admitted on air that there was no news from the hospital where the Duchess was in labour

A BBC reporter shocked viewers yesterday by reporting that there was no news to come from the hospital where Kate gave birth.

Simon McCoy was covering the birth of the new Prince from outside the Lindo Wing of St. Mary’s Hospital.

In a moment of complete honesty, he stated: ‘Well, plenty more to come from here of course. None of it news because that will come from Buckingham Palace. But that won't stop us,’ reported the Huffington Post.

Broadcasters have been criticised for the relentless coverage of the hospital with little content.

In another video, posted by Buzzfeed McCoy is seen reading viewer comments on the air.

In
response to critical comments, he said: ‘We will be speculating about 
this royal birth with no facts ... at the moment," he said in response 
to the critical comments.’

The reporter waited outside the Lindo Wing after the Duchess was admitted when she went into labour.

Mr McCoy also said: ‘Never have so many people gathered together in one place with absolutely nothing to say.'

He added: ‘Was it really 6 o’clock that it was announced? It feels a lot longer than that.’

Simon
had been dispatched from the desk from which he normally reads the news
to St. Mary’s Hospital, where he had joined hundreds with others who 
seemed to have nothing to say.

Having little comment, she resorted to interviewing Sky's own reporters.

She also struggled to find members of the public that would be as enthusiastic about the birth of a boy as she was.
