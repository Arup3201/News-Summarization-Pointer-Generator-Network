Amy Childs loves her curvy body but has admitted it isn't always easy to find pretty bras to fit her surgically enhanced 32DD size.

But she said she has now found the solution after becoming a brand ambassador for Alexis Smith lingerie.

The label is the brainchild of designer Alexis Smith, 28, who launched her range in 2010 because she wanted to provide underwear that was both stylish and practical for petite women with large busts.

Pretty in pink: This limited edition set is £50

Former TOWIE star Amy said: 'I love Alexis Smith Lingerie and have 
worn their sets for so long as I have always struggled to find pretty 
bras for my size. I am so happy to be the new face of the brand.'

Amy is the face of the new spring/summer collection that includes a limited edition 'pink sugar' lingerie set for £50. Here, she models the range that comes in UK size 32, cup size D and up.

Prices start at £15.99 for briefs and £29.99 for bras.

Amy, 22, already has her own successful clothing line and Alexis said she was delighted the 'Queen of Essex' agreed to model her latest collection.

She said: 'Amy is everything the brand represents - young, glamorous, fashion forward and fun! It's fantastic to see her looking stunning in all of my lingerie collections, and rocking them with style.'

Amy recently told the MailOnline that she has never felt more body confident after this year stepping up her fitness regime by running the London Marathon.

Designer Alexis said: 'It's fantastic to see Amy looking stunning in all of my lingerie collections, and rocking them with style'

She said: 'It’s so important to look 
after yourself inside and out. I’ve been criticised about the way I look
and even been asked if I have had lipo.

'I want girls to know they can stay fit 
by eating well and working out. Since I finished training for the 
marathon I just do my fitness DVD three times a week.

'I feel really confident at the moment and think I have curves in the right place but I’m not too skinny.'

Alexis Smith Lingerie is available to buy from www.alexissmith.eu and www.amychildsofficial.co.uk
