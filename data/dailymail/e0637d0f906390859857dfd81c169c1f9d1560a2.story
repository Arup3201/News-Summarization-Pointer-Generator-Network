When Prince Charles wrote passionately of protecting ‘beautiful landscapes with hedgerows’ and the ‘folly’ of losing farmland, he captured the public mood.

However, his cover article for the latest edition of Country Life, has enraged farmers and nature lovers at the very heart of his Duchy of Cornwall estate.

The reason? Just compare the following two photographs.

PEACEFUL: The Duchy's Tregurra Valley last year when it was peaceful, rolling farmlands

UNRECOGNISABLE: The valley as a development consortium which will include a Waitrose supermarket

When Prince Charles wrote passionately of protecting ‘beautiful landscapes with hedgerows’ and the ‘folly’ of losing farmland, he captured the public mood

One shows the Duchy’s Tregurra Valley last year when it was peaceful, rolling farmland, lined with ancient hedgebanks and sown with maize to feed a 200-strong dairy herd.

The other shows it today as a development consortium – which includes the Duchy – builds a Waitrose supermarket, housing estate, car park and recycling centre.

One furious critic has described it as ‘hypocrisy with a capital H’.

Cornwall Council approved the £40 million complex last year. It includes a ‘Cornish Food Hall’ and an EU-funded park-and-ride scheme aimed at cutting traffic through Truro’s historic streets. About a third of the 97 houses are to be ‘affordable’.

The Duchy, which donated the 55-acre site and leased part back to the county council at peppercorn rent, says the authority asked it to provide a ‘sustainable’ solution to traffic congestion while easing a housing crisis.

However critics, led by Truro City Council, say the project has delivered precisely what the Prince is railing against – the destruction of high- quality farmland and a precious rural landscape. They claim it will do little to ease either traffic or housing problems, and will compete with small food producers for business.

For its part the Duchy can point to a judicial review which has dismissed the city council’s fears and backed planning approval.

A spokesman said the Estate was asked by planners in 2005 to donate land for ‘the growing needs of the local community’. She insisted the site was not prime agricultural land and that 6,000 trees would be planted once landscaping was complete.

PLEA: The article in Country Life's November 12 edition has enraged farmers and nature lovers

FURY: The protest sign at the Tregurra Valley, in the Duchy of Cornwall estate, was quickly ripped down

‘The Duchy would not have become involved if it was not absolutely convinced of the sustainable benefits of the scheme,’ she said.

In his Country Life article, Charles writes: ‘It would not only be a folly to lose agricultural land, it would be equally foolish to use it in ways that are not environmentally sustainable in the long-term.’

He describes the countryside as ‘that delicately woven tapestry’ and warns: ‘Start pulling out the threads and the rest unravels very rapidly indeed and is very difficult to put back again – no farmers, no beautiful landscapes with hedgerows and stone walls, no thriving rural communities.’

Ian Hibberd, founder of the Save Truro campaign, described the article as ‘truly breathtaking’, adding: ‘Charles writes of protecting and nurturing the very farmland his people are busy destroying in Cornwall.

‘He cares about farmers and the countryside only until they get in the way of his own financial interests. Then he pushes them out.

‘In this case a Duchy tenant farmer has had to sell his dairy herd because he can no longer feed them. Prime productive land has been lost and a beautiful valley destroyed.’

He said there were suspicions the Duchy and Waitrose, which has exclusive rights to sell the organic food brand Duchy Originals, had become commercially too close.

Fellow campaign leader Hilary Keam said her protest sign – ‘This Valley Destroyed Thanks To Prince Charles and 11 Cornwall Councillors’ – had been quickly ripped down.

‘We had to keep rescuing it from the refuse dump,’ she said. ‘But we are mere mortals and powerless against the Duchy. The Duke of Cornwall’s comments in Country Life beggar belief. He is the destroyer of Cornwall.This is hypocrisy with a capital H.’

Among the formal objectors were the Helston and St Keverne Young Farmers’ Club. Secretary Frances Hosken said: ‘We felt this proposal was wrong. We need every bit of productive land we can get. We’re all young farmers. This is our future being sold off.’

Nigel Ekins, chairman of Truro Farmers Market, said that the Duchy-Waitrose partnership would hit city centre trade by 8 per cent.

‘They’re not looking after small farmers and producers,’ he added. ‘The so-called Cornish Food Hall is just another outlet for the big boys.’

Waitrose said: ‘We can confirm that we will be a tenant of the Duchy of Cornwall after originally being approached by Cornwall Council.’
