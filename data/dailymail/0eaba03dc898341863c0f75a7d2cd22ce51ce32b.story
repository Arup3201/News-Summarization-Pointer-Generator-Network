Mercedes are to wait until this year's Formula One championship fight has been resolved before continuing new contract talks with Lewis Hamilton.

Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff announced last month, following the confirmation of a new deal for Nico Rosberg, that negotiations had started with Hamilton about an extension to his own contract.

But Wolff does not feel, given the intensity of the battle for this year's title between Hamilton and team-mate Rosberg, that it is right to be taking the Briton's focus away from his bid win a second drivers' crown by talking to him about a new contract.

Mercedes are eager to retain Hamilton, despite the feud that has now erupted between the 29-year-old and Rosberg. On Sunday, Hamilton accused Rosberg of deliberately driving into him on lap two of the Belgian Grand Prix.

He was forced to retire late on due to the damage to his car caused by the collision and is now 29 points adrift of Rosberg in the drivers' standings.

The drivers and senior team management - Wolff and executive technical director Paddy Lowe - are expected to meet at the team's Brackley base on Friday in a bid to resolve some of the issues between the pair.

In terms of the Hamilton discussions, time is on the side of both parties as his current deal does not expire until the end of next year.

When asked about the situation, Wolff said: 'We've been talking to one another daily.

'But at this stage things are very intense and you have to stay concentrated on the season.

'One thing is for sure, we are not going to talk to anybody else before having a very clear situation about how we can continue to work with Lewis.

'This is what we have said to each other, that we have no interest in having any other conversation with any other driver.

'We are not having any, and Lewis is not having any discussion with any other team, so this is why we trust each other.

'We feel at the moment we need to be concentrated on the championship and not get involved in contractual discussions, intense discussions, because it is something which is one and a half years in front of us.'
