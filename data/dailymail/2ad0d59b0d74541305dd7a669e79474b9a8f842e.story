Pippa Middleton looked tanned and relaxed in a £750 Hugo Boss ice blue gown with a daring plunging neckline at the inaugural ParaSnowBall party in London.

The 31-year-old, who was making her first public appearance since a rumoured US TV deal broke down, was joined by a host of medallists and snowsports enthusiasts.

Also there was Heather Mills, 47, the former wife of Paul McCartney who made a beeline for the royal in-law on the red carpet.

While things may not be going her way in the career world, Pippa Middleton has still got it when it comes to the style stakes. She's got a knack similarly to her Duchess sister, seemingly able to knock us dead each time she steps out.

She looked stunning stepping out here at the ParaSnowBall donning a white plunging maxi dress that while safe, ticked all the boxes for us. We are huge fans on the Fashion Finder desk of classic style, whether that's in the form of the little black dress, simple pointed courts or a pleated maxi dress like Pippa's, we think simple and sophisticated is often the best way to go, especially for posh dos such as this. And after that famous moment at Kate's wedding, Pippa can't really go wrong in a white full-length number, can she?

Which is why we've done all the hard work for you, scouting the web for plunging white maxi dresses to help you channel Pippa's style. Sadly we can't promise you the derriere to match, that problem ladies is all yours!

Ms Mills, an enthusiastic skier herself, shimmered in a floor-length emerald green dress and chatted to other guests, among them Paralympic skier Millie Knight, during the event which was hosted by BBC broadcaster John Inverdale.  

The glitzy bash celebrates Great Britain’s Disabled Snowsports team and doubles as a fundraiser for Disability SnowSport UK, a charity dedicated to getting the less able onto the slopes. 

Guests at the event were kept entertained by a magician, among them a sceptical-looking Pippa who was eventually won over by the performer's sleight of hand.

Pippa, a keen skier who used her most recent Vanity Fair column to offer tips on the best places to ski, made a speech at the event in which she spoke of her delight at being there.

'I am honoured to be supporting Disability SnowSport UK and as a keen skier myself, I feel very passionately about enabling those with a disability to experience the joy of skiing alongside able-bodied people,' she said.

'The ParaSnowBall will be an inspirational celebration of Paralympians as well as raising funds to enable snowsports to be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of their disability.'

Organisers hope the fundraiser and  Pippa's attendance will boost the profile of snow sports and encourage more young people to get involved – and go on to take medals in major competitions.

Fiona Young, the CEO of Disability Sport UK, said: 'We're proud to have the support of Pippa Middleton for our worthwhile cause.

'We are enormously excited to announce the launch of our ParaSnowBall and the great platform it will be for Disability SnowSport UK.

'Our long term vision is that this will grow into a signature, annual event which will guarantee a high level of income to support our ongoing initiatives as well as fund new projects.' 

Jamie Ritblat, CEO and founder of Delancey, the event's headline sponsor, said: 'As principal sponsor of British Ski and Snowboard and supporter of the innovative inner city youth snowsports charity Snow-Camp, Delancey is committed to making snowsports more accessible to all people across the UK, regardless of ability or background.

'Great Britain’s Paralympians made the whole nation proud at Sochi, 2014, and we are thrilled to join in celebrating their success, while helping to ensure that Disability SnowSport UK is able to carry on the incredible work it does to help enable anyone with a disability to experience the joy and thrill of snowsports.'

The event kick-starts an important week for GB’s snowsports athletes, with the arrival of the Delancey British National Alpine Ski Championships and The BRITS in Tignes, France, this weekend

As well as featuring some of Great Britain's most talented ski and snowboard athletes, thousands of students will also descend on the resort for the British Universities Snowsports Championships.

Last night's event is the first time Pippa has been seen in public since rumours surfaced over the weekend that talks with the US broadcaster NBC have broken down.

She had reportedly been in line for a £400,000 deal, but talks have 'stalled' with sources describing a pilot scene featuring Wild West dancing as 'cringe-worthy'.
