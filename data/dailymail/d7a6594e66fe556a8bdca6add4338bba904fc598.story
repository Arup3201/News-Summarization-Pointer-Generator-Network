The nephew of Alan Henning has posted an emotional tribute on Twitter to his 'hero' uncle after the aid worker was captured and beheaded by ISIS extremists.

Stuart Henning wrote 'RIP uncle Alan you are and will always be my hero love you' as news of the killing emerged last night.

Today, friends, neighbours and former colleagues of the 47-year-old reacted to news of his death with a mixture of shock, disbelief and anger.

Many gathered outside the house where he lived in Salford, Greater Manchester, to light candles and comfort each other.

Many residents were too upset to comment while others struggled to hold back tears.

One woman, who did not wish to be named, said: 'I used to see Alan all the time.

'He'd always say 'hello' and was very friendly. This is terrible news.'

Yellow ribbons were tied to lampposts, houses and cars in the street in support for Mr Henning's family.

Another woman said she was 'lost for words', adding: 'I don't know how to describe it. I don't know what to say.'

Alan lived with his wife Barbara and their two children. Last week Mrs Henning had made a desperate appeal to his captors to spare his life, pleading with them to show 'mercy' and 'clemency'.

But the plea fell on deaf ears as ISIS released its latest video on Friday showing Mr Henning being beheaded by the fighter who's become known as Jihadi John. 

Mr Henning, 47, was kidnapped by extremists while delivering aid in Syria in December.

Fellow aid worker Majid Freeman, from Leicester, who was with him when was seized, told BBC Radio 4's Today this morning: 'He was an everyday man like you or me. He's seen the massacres and innocents being oppressed.

Mr Henning's local MP Barbara Keeley said the death would be a 'devastating loss' for his family

'He didn't look at religion, he saw them as human beings and he wanted to make a difference. He was helping widows, orphaned children, people the international community had abandoned.' 

Kasim Jameel, from Bolton, who was with Mr Henning on the convoys and first interested him in helping the people of Syria, said today: 'I'm totally heartbroken. What can you say? When you lose someone so important to you, you can't put it into words.

'Everyone that knew him from the convoys just can't stop crying, grown men with beards. We keep expecting him to come round the corner, and say, "I was only joking".

'He is the best of the best, a pure soul, he is in the best paradise. It's time for him to rest, he's done a lot of work, God's called an angel back.'

This afternoon Imam Asim Hussain from the Manchester Central Mosque described the killers as an 'Insult to the Islamic faith'. 

Last night Mr Henning's local MP Baraba Keening told Manchester Evening News: 'Everyone takes great pride in him and what he was doing.'

And the Rt Revd Dr David Walker, Bishop of Manchester, is reported as saying this morning: 'In his life Alan Henning united people across the boundaries of nationality and faith. He did so both through his humanitarian actions and by the love that drove him on.

'That his tragic death continues to unite people across Britain and beyond is demonstrated today by the range of people and organisations paying him tribute.

'To ISIS we say: You no longer have the power to shock us, now you just sicken us. Your brutality, against any who don't share your narrow, perverted worldview, doesn't undermine our determination, it stiffens our resolve.'

In a statement released today, Greater Manchester’s Police and Crime Commissioner Tony Lloyd said people across the area would be 'shocked' at the murder. 

'Our thoughts are with his family and circle of loved ones at this terrible time,' he said.

'What they are going through is unimaginable. All we can do is express our sympathy and pledge to remember Alan for what he was – a thoroughly decent man and the kind of quiet humanitarian who makes this world a better place.

'This is murder, plain and simple. That it could be claimed to be in the name of religion is obscene and all people of faith will abhor this brutal act of cowardice.

'Alan Henning will not be forgotten – he made a difference to people’s lives and while the world is a little darker today, his commitment to the cause of humanity will last longer and burn brighter than the supposed cause of the evil men who took his life.' 

The former taxi driver had worked for New Lyle Cars, in Eccles, but a radio operator at the company said no-one was available to comment.

Martyn Shedwick, a friend who helped repair one of the donated ambulances driven in the convoy to Syria, told the Manchester Evening News: 'He's quite an amazing guy for what he's done. An ordinary bloke, just wanting to help out, that's all it is.

'He never talked about politics or religion or anything. 

British Imams and Muslim faith leaders have expressed their outrage at the 'senseless' murder of taxi driver Alan Henning by 'barbarian' terrorists.

Leading British Muslim leaders called for special remembrance prayers to take place this weekend in Mr Henning’s honour.

Shaukat Warraich, editor of Imamsonline.com and chief executive of Faith Associates, said: 'The Muslim community is devastated at the news that the humanitarian worker has been murdered by these barbarians.

'He was a friend of the Muslim community, Syrian and Iraqi people. His senseless murder proves that ISIS is beyond the pale and doesn’t listen to reason.

'The fact that they have chosen to do this at the time of Eid as millions of Muslims are joining together in prayer as a celebration of unity only goes to show their complete evil and barbarity.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Alan Henning at this most difficult time.'

Faith Associates works with some of the 1,700 mosques across the country and was recently behind an open letter signed by more than 100 Imams condemning ISIS and urging British Muslims not to travel to Syria.

Shaukat Warraich (pictured), editor of Imamsonline.com and chief executive of Faith Associates, said the Muslim community was 'devastated' at news Alan Henning had been killed 

They are now urging Imams to use sermons during Eid prayers to ask their congregations to make a special prayer for the family of Alan Henning.

Muslim faith leaders across Britain have also expressed their outrage at the murder in a video released yesterday.

In a series of hard-hitting and emotional statements, the short video features five leading Muslim voices expressing their horror and condemning ISIS.

Speaking in the 1:46mins video, Imam Ghulam Rasool, Principle of Birmingham’s Sultan Bahu Trust, says: 'Regarding this unfortunate, despicable video released by ISIS which brutally, callously and cold-heartedly murders an innocent humanitarian aid worker – just for public show, just for them to express their power – it’s a complete abomination.

'It’s condemned unreservedly by the British Muslim community and rightly so. This act is a criminal act and a gross act of terrorism and evil.'

Ustadh Ashfaq Sadiq, Secretary of the Barking Masjid, added: 'The majority of Muslims are peace-loving people. This minority appear to have grabbed and hijacked the religion, for their own ends.

'You’re not doing this in my name, you’re not doing it in the name of my Islam. Your Islam I don’t recognize. It’s not Islam, I don’t recognize you as a Muslim.'

Denouncing the murder, Zafar Iqbal, Chairman of Wycombe Islamic Mission, said: 'We don’t believe that a Muslim can do this sort of evil act. We condemn that, we always condemn this sort of activity. This is not Islamic.'

Jama Egal, Manager of the Quba Centre in Leicester, added: 'They’re completely wrong. They don’t know the meaning of the Quran, they don’t know the way of the Quran.' 

And Dr Musharraf Hussain, Imam of Masjir As-Shifa in Nottingham, said: 'This group of course is a criminal group.

'A gang which has no space, no place in the Muslim community. Neither does the British Muslim community have any kind of sympathy for such evil acts and brutal activities ISIS.'

'Despite all the badness in the world, there's some really good people as well and Alan is one of them - he just really wanted to help.'

Tony McNeil, from the Bolton Interfaith Council, who helped organise a vigil for Mr Henning, said: 'My first reaction was shock and outrage really.

'We've been in suspended animation and limbo ever since all this business started.

'I must admit I didn't honestly believe they would take his life.

'I thought there would be some type of leadership in that group who would say to take Alan's life would be a step too far.'

'Our thought are with the family and the community and all of Alan's Muslim's friends as well - this has put a great smear on the whole religion, which is a sad thing as well.'
