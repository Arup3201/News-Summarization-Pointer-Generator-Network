When Luiz Felipe Scolari was asked for his reaction, his answer was about as sorry as Brazil looked on the pitch.

'Please excuse us for this mistake,' the Brazil manager said, admitting being beaten 7-1 in their own back yard was nothing short of a 'catastrophe'.

Scolari remained resilient by reminding the reeling footballing world that the hosts did their best after Brazil conquered almost every department - apart from the one that mattered most.

Brazil were 5-0 down by half time and ended up being humiliated 7-1.

But the statistics told a different story.

Despite their thrashing, Brazil actually registered the most attacks, attempts and shots on target.

They recovered the most lost balls, Julio Cesar made the most saves and they swung more crosses into the box than their opponents.

Possession? Check. Most shots on target? Check. Tackles won? Check.

But it counted for little as Germany were clinical, changing the scoreline from 1-0 to 5-0 in six first-half minutes.

The Brazil team bus has the slogan 'Preparem-se! O hexa esta chegando!' ('Brace yourselves! The sixth is coming!') on the side, and while it referred to a sixth World Cup triumph not a sixth German goal, the message appeared horribly prophetic.

Scolari said: ‘It’s probably the worst moment of my career.

'This is the worst day of my life, but life goes on.

‘I’ll be remembered probably because I lost 7-1 - the worst defeat Brazil
 have ever had - but that was a risk I knew I was running when I accepted
 this position. Life goes on. That’s what I’ll do.

‘We did what we thought was our best, and we lost to a great team that 
had the team, in six or seven minutes, to end the game with three or 
four goals in extraordinary manner.

‘I can tell you that, after the first goal, we had a problem and, with 
the skills of a team who have been working together for a long time, 
they capitalised on it.

‘We will continue working and honouring what our team means for the 
third place match in Brasilia.

‘I’d like to thank the supporters for 
supporting the players despite us losing by five, six, seven. It was 
interesting to see that happen.’

Brazil have one more game left of their World Cup in the third and fourth play-off decider.
