The woman who killed her boyfriend by stabbing him with a stiletto was arraigned in court today claiming that she acted in self-defense.

44-year-old Ana Trujillo admitted to police that she killed her 59-year-old boyfriend Alf Stefan Andersson in a lover's spat at their apartment early Sunday morning.

Trujillo and Andersson, a professor at the University of Houston, had spent most of the evening at Bodegas, a local taco shop, where they drank a couple bottles of wine and took a few tequila shots.

Walter Garcia, an assistant manager 
at the restaurant saw the couple there often. Andersson often came by 
himself, but would bring along his girlfriend on Fridays or special 
occasions.

'I knew him. He was a good person,' Garcia told the AP. 'They looked like a normal couple.'

But things turned sour that night 
when another man approached Trujillo at the bar and offered to buy her a
drink. Andersson got jealous of the stranger's advances which spurned a
fight back at his apartment around 2 a.m.

The ensuing fight was so loud, that neighbors thought it sounded like furniture moving.

When Andersson grabbed her, Trujillo 
told police the she pulled his hair - so much so that she had clumps of 
it in her hands. When that didn't stop him she started beating him with a
stiletto shoe causing multiple stab wounds.

Police arrived at 3:44 a.m., but who called the authorities is still unclear.When
police got to the 18th floor of the condo, Trujillo opened the door and
let officers into the unit, which is where they found Andersson in a 
hallway between the entryway and the kitchen.

While
Trujillo claims she acted in self-defense, that doesn't change the 
charges, according to Sara Marie Kinney, a spokesman for the Harris 
County District Attorney's office.

'She confessed to doing it. The reason and all of that will play out in court,' Kinney said.

Trujillo was charged with murder 
Wednesday, and is being held on $100,000 bond. Her lawyers has requested
a mental evaluation of his client.

Andersson is survived by all of his friends at Bodegas, who are sad to lose a regular and a friend.

'Everybody, now, we're very sad, angry with her, because he was customer No. 1,' Garcia

The bar is hosting a memorial for Andersson on Thursday where they will drink Bud Light and Jiro Tequila - his favorite drinks.
