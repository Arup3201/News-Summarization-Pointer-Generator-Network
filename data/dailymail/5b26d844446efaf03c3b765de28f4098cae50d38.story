A lack of oxygen from underdeveloped lungs is to blame for the death of an eight-day old giant panda at the Smithsonian's National Zoo last month.

The new details into the 4-ounce cub's unexpected death were revealed from a necropsy on Thursday finding the infant having also suffered liver necrosis, or the death of liver cells, according to the National Zoo's Chief veterinarian Suzan Murray at a news conference.

The cub, believed to have been a girl and described as no bigger than a stick of butter, was also found with fluid in her abdomen and her liver hard in places.

Improving: National Park Zookeepers said today that Mei Xiang, pictured sunbathing, is showing much improvement after hiding away while mourning the loss of her baby

Can you see her? After her baby's birth Mei Xiang clutched her tiny cub so tight to her that even zookeepers had a hard time spotting her on this camera

After the panda mother's previous five failed pregnancies the cub's death came as an enormous heartbreak to her zookeepers in Washington, D.C.

Seen cradling a familiar toy in her arms for days following, however, mother Mei Xiang was especially devastated.

Today the zoo reports Mei Xiang being 'almost completely back to her old self' and no longer with her then-treasured toy.

She is also venturing out of her den and eating well.

'Mei is choosing to go outside in the mornings. In the afternoons she can usually be found napping on her indoor rockwork. Mei’s appetite has also returned, and she is eating almost all of her bamboo and all of her leaf eater biscuits and produce,' the zoo reported.

The zoo also offered a glimpse of Mei Xiang in her yard on Thursday.

Heartache: The 14-year-old mother, seen sleeping, had experienced five failed pregnancies before abruptly losing her last cub

Previous mom: Mei Xiang is seen in December of 2005 with her first cub Tai Shan who as per agreement with China was sent to them after his birth

Father: The father of Mei Xiang's cub, Tian Tian is also seen about their enclosure on Thursday while enjoying a frozen fruit treat

The cub, which was not named, was born on Sept. 16 and came as an enormous surprise because it hadn't been clear whether 14-year-old Mei Xiang, considered middle-aged for a panda, was still fertile.

Her curious behaviour seen nesting and eventually cuddling her rubber ‘kong’ toy gradually tipped off her keepers.

When the cub was born at 10.45pm on 
September 16, she cast the toy aside and held her tiny baby tight in her
paws so that it would be warm and have easy access to her milk.

She
kept the cub so tight to her chest that zookeepers were scarcely able 
to catch a glimpse of the newborn from the camera inside the panda den.

Zookeepers recorded the purrs and 'honks' of the contented newborn and took the noises as confirmation that she was healthy.

Zoo keepers left the pair alone, hoping Mei Xiang could raise the cub without interference.

No trauma: Staff of the National Zoo held a press conference on Thursday to report the results of the cub's necropsy that included no signs of internal or external trauma to the baby

Park's handling: Parts of the park were seen closed after the birth of the baby panda though they announced all except Mei Xiang's den open to the public's view

However, at 8.53am on Sunday, something went horribly wrong. It was the last time the veterinarians heard a peep from the cub.

By 9.17am Mei Xiang began uttering distress howls. Her disturbed cries alerted zookeepers that something terrible had happened.

They
stood behind iron bars in the panda paddock and distracted Mei Xiang with honey, 
while other staffers used to stick to slid the cub away from her. 

After an hour, they had the lifeless cub in their hands and tried to perform emergency resuscitation, but it was no use. The top exotic animal veterinarians in the country were unable to revive the cub.

With her cub gone, Mei Xiang returned to her familiar toy for comfort. Soon after she lost the cub, she began clutching it again, just as she had before the baby was born.

'Most of her behavior has gone back to where she was before the panda cub was born, but she is still cradling this toy,' National Zoo spokeswoman Emily Grebenstein told MailOnline after the cub's death.

She said she found milk in the cub's digestive tract, meaning she had been successfully nursing from her mother before her death.

'We’d all felt that Mei Xiang had been a very good mother and had been very gentle with the cub, and indeed, that turns out to be the case,' Dr Murray said after finding milk in the cub's digestive track, meaning she had been successfully nursing before her death.

The cub was also found without any signs of internal or external trauma.

The seasoned animal surgeon, and mother of three, nearly broke down as she described the dead newborn.

'The cub was just beautiful. Beautiful little body. Beautiful face, with the markings just beginning to show around the eye. Couldn’t have been more beautiful,' she said.

The tragedy is a familiar one for the National Zoo. Out of eight giant panda cubs born since the zoo began its breeding program in the 1970s, only one has survived to maturity.

The rest died within a few days of being born.

Mei Xiang and Tian Tian are the National Zoo's second pair of pandas. They are in the United States on loan from the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong, Sichuan Province until December of 2015.

The 14-year-old mother has given birth twice at the National Zoo. In 2005, offspring Tai Shan became the first giant panda cub to survive more than a few days at the zoo. He was sent to China, as per the zoo's agreement with the Chinese government.
