Balanced high above the desert skyline at sunset, there can be no doubt that anyone attending Utah's annual slacklining festival needs a good head for heights.

Pictured smiling perched 400ft above the ground these daredevils are confident enough in their ability to stay on the highline that they stop and pose for photos.

They are among hundreds of adrenalin junkies from across the world who travelled to the Utah desert to take part in the fifth annual slack lining, base jumping and climbing festival known as the Turkey Boogie.

Participants' adventures are captured in this stunning set of pictures taken by event organiser Scott Rogers, 25, who started the annual gathering as a way of getting his friends from around the globe together each year.

He said: 'People are often all over the world doing their thing so it's a place we can all get together and let off steam and have some fun.

'It started out as something really informal with about 20 people at the first event.

'As the years went on we continued to host the event and word-of-mouth, as well as the beautiful pictures we captured every year, helped it to grow in popularity.

'This year was the biggest yet with more than 100 people attending from lots of different countries.'

The festival lasts for ten days but the first two days are devoted to getting ropes and equipment set up.

This year, it got off to a dramatic start with one of the 130 people who attended had to be carried down the mountain and airlifted to hospital after picking up an injury.

Scott, from Denver, Colorado, added: 'Fortunately she was okay and the rest of us were able to do some really great highlining and BASE jumping during the festival just as I hoped.

'It's just a full on week of absolute shenanigans - it's unbelievable.'

Scott, who has been slacklining for 10 years and BASE jumping for four years, got his first taste of the daring sport at a climbing competition he was competing in.

He was so amazed by it that he forgot to compete and just slacklined all day.

He said: 'At the festival, which has taken the name Turkey Boogie, the community comes together and creates a space where people can do these dangerous things with the help and support of others.

'For an entire week we walk highlines at or above our ability level. We take falls, we get back up, we try again, we walk across.

'The feeling of doing something both physically and mentally difficult is taken to the next level when you have the support of your friends.

'Spending time here is just unbelievable. Everyone becomes great mates and you never know who you might bump into each year.

'I don't think there is anywhere else in the world you can have as much fun.'
