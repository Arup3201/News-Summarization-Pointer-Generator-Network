Qatar tonight refuted was claims that money for UK firms working on World Cup 2022 venues is being siphoned off to ISIS extremists.

The Commons was told British firms awarded contracts for the project in Qatar are being short-changed while some of the unpaid cash has ended up in the hands of the Islamic extremists in Syria.

But Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani told MailOnline it is a ’serious allegation’ which the government ’refutes completely’. 

It is claimed British firms working on Qatar World Cup venues have been denied money which has been redirected to ISIS extremists

Labour MP Steve Rotheram raised the cases in Parliament ahead of David Cameron holding talks with the Emir of Qatar tomorrow.

It is claimed British firms working on Qatar World Cup venues have been denied money which has been redirected to ISIS extremists Critics want pressure to be put on Qatar to stop the flow of money between rich donors and extremists threatening countries around the world.

Qatar controversially won the bid to host the 2022 World Cup, despite widespread concern that soaring temperatures will make games impossible to play.

Several British construction firms have won contracts to work for big Qatari firms on building venues in the country.

However, Mr Rotherham claimed that companies have had money withheld which has been redirected to Islamic extremists in Syria.

In a statement, the Qatari Prime Minister said: ’It is a serious allegation and it is one we refute completely.

’Let me be clear, for the avoidance of doubt, we will stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies in the Middle East and around the world to face down the terrorist threat.’

Earlier in the Commons, Mr Rotherham, the MP for Liverpool Walton, called on ministers to examine the allegations. 

Speaking during Foreign Office question time, Mr Rotheram said: 'There are accusations that some UK companies are being short-changed on contracts associated with the construction of World Cup venues in Qatar and even claims that some monies unpaid are being siphoned off to Syria and into the hands of Isil.'

He told Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood: 'Can you look urgently to these allegations and can you offer support to UK firms regarding their reimbursement by the Qatari royalty, government or businesses?'

Mr Ellwood replied: 'I was in Doha last week and I raised this very issue. They do what is called a kafala system which has now been upgraded, which you may be aware of.

'It is being replaced to give greater rights to migrant workers - there's 1.3 million in Qatar - but also giving responsibilities to the employers as well to make sure they look after these.

'It is something that will be raised this week when the Emir of Qatar visits this country.' 

Mr Cameron is expected to meet with Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, tomorrow afternoon for bilateral talks in Downing Street.

Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the Emir of Qatar, is  visiting London this week to promote economic investment in Britain

In August Qatar denied supporting ISIS militants, insisting that 'determined, collective action' was needed to end sectarian violence in Iraq and Syria.

And  officials including Qatar's director of intelligence told the BBC that the country only supported moderate rebel groups in Syria and 'had nothing to hide'.

But this week a US government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington believes Turkey is partnering with Qatar in providing support to Islamist factions and militias in Libya. 

At the weekend Tory MP Stephen Barclay told the Sunday Telegraph: 'It remains unclear whether money is still flowing from Qatari nationals.

'There is clear evidence that Qatari nationals have been instrumental in the financing of Sunni terror groups and the Prime Minister should not avoid tackling this issue head on with the Emir.'

Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said the meeting was a 'perfect opportunity' to tell the Qataris they could no longer 'run with the hare and hunt with the hounds'.

Foreign Office minister Baroness Jay said this week that ISIS's main sources of revenue come from oil sales and extortion.

But other sources have included foreign donors, kidnap ransom payments, and money stolen during its advances in recent months.

She added: 'We are working with countries in the Middle East to counter the threat from terrorists and extremists across the region. Combating ISIL and degrading its financial support is a priority and we continue to discuss these issues with our partners, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

'We are working closely with all our international partners to intensify efforts to stem ISIL's funding flows.'
