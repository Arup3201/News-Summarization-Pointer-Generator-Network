The chief of police in Magaluf has been arrested after British bar owners made allegations of extortion, corruption and drug dealing in the scandal-hit resort.

Jose Antonio Navarro was detained amid claims officers demanded money from bar owners and tipped them off about police raids.

Carnage Magaluf - which hit the headlines when an 18-year-old British girl was caught on video performing sex acts on 24 men - is one of the businesses reported to have made a complaint.

Following a summer of scandal, the chief of police of Magaluf has been arrested amid claims of corruption

Two other officers, who have not been named, were also arrested over allegations that have shocked the resort on the Spanish island of Majorca.

Chief Inspector Navarro was held by the Civil Guard in the early hours of Monday morning and was remanded in custody by investigating magistrate Carmen Gonzalez.

His arrest came after several businessmen made a formal complaint to anti-corruption prosecutors last Friday.

Officers allegedly turned a blind eye to crimes by rival businesses and tipped them off in advance of police drugs raids.

Local newspaper Diario de Mallorca said the allegations included 'extortion, favouritism to certain bars and drug trafficking.'

Navarro appeared at a behind-closed-doors hearing yesterday. Prosecutors are studying a video and emails provided by the bar owners making the allegations.

The resort came in for criticism this summer after a video emerged of a girl performing sex acts on 24 men

Local newspapers said officers are also alleged to have planted drugs in bars. A spokesman for the Civil Guard confirmed Mr Navarro had been arrested on the instruction of the judge.

The spokesman said: 'The judge instructed our officers to carry out the arrest. The judge is leading the investigation and there is a secrecy order preventing us saying any more.'

Magaluf has a reputation for attracting British youngsters looking for sex and cheap alcohol.

The resort hit the headlines this summer when an 18-year-old British girl was videoed performing sex acts on 24 men in a bar, while on a pub crawl organised by Carnage Magaluf.

This week another 18-year-old girl let 15 strangers lick cream from her breasts as part of her 18th birthday celebrations.

Spanish authorities have tried to clamp down on outrageous drunken behaviour in Magaluf this summer.

They have introduced new regulations for pub crawls, have ordered bars to close and imposed massive fines.

The allegations of corruption against local police are said to have come from bar owners in the resort
