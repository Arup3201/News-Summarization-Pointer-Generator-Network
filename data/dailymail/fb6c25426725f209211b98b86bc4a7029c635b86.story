Lay-offs at the Environment Agency will affect the organisation’s ability to cope with flooding, bosses said last night.

More than 550 staff who work in flood risk management could lose their jobs as part of restructuring to save money.

The news comes as Britain is hit by extreme weather yet again, leading to widespread flood warnings across the country.

Flooding: Government cuts could make it harder to deal with extreme events such as the floods in Yalding, Kent over the past couple of weeks

In some areas, flood water has yet to recede two weeks after a huge storm crippled transport networks and left thousands without power in the run-up to Christmas.

Paul Leinster, the agency’s chief executive, said maintenance work would be hit and new developments would have to be ‘resized’.

‘Flood risk maintenance will be impacted,’ he told The ENDS Report, an environmental magazine.

‘And we’re looking at a proportionate reduction in the number of people in flood risk management.’

Extreme: Britain has been battered by heavy rain and strong winds over the past two weeks 

The planned staff losses come despite a funding increase from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

That money will go to long-term capital spending mitigating the impact of future storms - but there are concerns the employee cuts will reduce the effectiveness of the new funds.

A spokesman for the agency downplayed the staffing cuts, adding: ‘Our budget for 2014-15 will be confirmed shortly.

‘However, we are likely to reduce staff numbers from the previous forecast of around 11,250 at the end of March 2014 to around 9,700 by October 2014 dependent on future funding.

‘We will then aim to keep numbers broadly at that level, through to March 2015, dependent of course on future funding.’

Last week, David Cameron paid tribute to the work of Environment Agency workers in helping flood-affected householders.

During a visit to Yalding in Kent, he said they had done 'an amazing job with the floods and extreme weather'.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson also praised the agency, telling the public that paying attention to its warnings was the best way to keep safe during storms.
