Ross Campbell allegedly made one student bend over his knee as he spanked him and told him he had been 'a naughty boy'

A professor of music at one of Britain’s top drama schools spanked students and asked one to call him daddy during private tuition lessons for his own sexual kicks, a court has heard.

Ross Campbell allegedly made one student bend over his knee as he spanked him and told him he had been 'a naughty boy', and was said to have reduced another to tears after thrashing his buttocks following a poor rendition of Being Alive from the musical Company.

The 56-year-old head of music at the prestigious 
Guildford School of Acting (GSA), is accused of sexually abusing three 
adult male pupils who had come to his home for one-to-one singing 
tuition between 2003 and 2011.

He denies four counts of indecent assault and a further seven counts of sexual assault while working at GSA, which is linked to the University of Surrey - and whose alumni include Brenda Blethyn OBE, Michael Ball and Bill Nighy.

Prosecutor Brian Stork told the jury of seven women and five men that Campbell was one of the most senior tutors with a great deal of responsibility.

He explained that he had links to the Royal Academy of Music and had performed both in this country and abroad.

Mr Stork said: 'Students trained with Ross Campbell because he had a reputation, a reputation of being an outstanding teacher, somebody very skilled in his art, somebody in who students placed a great deal of trust, somebody with whom they hoped to enjoy a professional relationship.'

'The difficulty we suggest is that this defendant overstepped the mark somewhat and allowed the personal to overlap the professional.

'Somebody who engaged in a number of practices that he may say were intended to help students develop either personally or as a singer or a performer but which we say reached a point of sexual abuse.

'This gentleman over-powered three individuals to enable himself to get a kick for his own sexual gratification, employing certain methods that were wholly inappropriate.'

The court was told that Campbell was the 'go to' teacher for singing and it was known that if students wanted to develop their skills they could approach him for private tuition.

Mr Stork told the jury that it was not uncommon or unusual for singing teachers to touch students’ anatomy during a lesson but would ask the student first.

He said that one victim described Campbell’s technique as 'unusual' and 'rather touchy-feely.'

The school's well known alumni include actor and singer Michael Ball and Bill Nighy

The court heard that during one 
tuition session he touched the man’s bottom while hugging him and in 
another grabbed his backside while accompanying him on the piano.

'That is not part of giving a singing lesson,' Mr Stork told the jury.

'That is not part of appropriate behaviour for teaching an adult male student.'

On
 another occasion it is claimed that the same student, who cannot be 
named for legal reasons, was taking part in a private lesson when 
Campbell told him he was a 'naughty boy' and said he deserved to be 
punished before inviting him to bend over his knee and be spanked.

He
 later sent the same student an email of a young boy screaming as he was
 being spanked while wearing little clothing, it was said.

The man said the teacher 
told him to call him 'Daddy' and also offered to give him a massage - 
but that he needed to be completely naked.

Campbell allegedly made the comments after inviting the student - then aged 19 or 20 years - to his home for lessons.

The
 student said at first he laughed off the spanking comments but even as 
the situation developed and he believed his teacher was being 
inappropriate, he went along with it because he trusted Campbell.

He
 said the inappropriate touching started when he began taking classes 
with Campbell in his second year at the school, in 2003, when Campbell 
would touch him to demonstrate the muscles used to support breathing.

His previous teacher had not done anything of the kind.

In
 his interview the man, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, told
 officers: 'Looking back I think of how things started, how he would 
always say: "You’re quite naughty. You need to be spanked".

'I thought he was just joking. I just laughed at it.

'He mentioned that a few times. I never thought he was going to spank me.

'It looks foolish, looking back, because he would ask me to lay over his lap.

'I asked: ‘"Why would you want me to do that?" and he said: "Because you are naughty and you need to be spanked".

'I trusted him. I thought he knew what he was doing.'

He
 said when he went to Campbell’s home for the lessons he would find the 
teacher had prepared dinner, which he would eat because he did not want 
to appear rude.

Campbell 
would mention his naughtiness and spanking and would also talk to him 
about his home life and his difficult relationship with his father.

'That’s how I let my guards (sic) down,' he said.

'We would talk about our private lives. He would ask me to give him a hug.

'At times I would ask him "why would you want me to hug you?" and he would say something like "it’s just affection. It’s ok".

He was grabbing my a*** some of the time, which I didn’t feel comfortable with.'

He said Campbell would appear reluctant when he tried to get him to give him the planned singing lesson.

'He would ask me to come closer to him and would take advantage to smack my bottom,' the man told police.

Despite his reservations the student continued to trust Campbell but would not comply with all of his requests.

He said: 'At one point he would say I need a massage and I needed to be totally naked and he would massage me.

'I refused and I remember him saying I was wrong to refuse, that it was totally wrong.

'That was the last time I went to his house because it made me feel really, really uncomfortable.

'If you were asking somebody to be totally naked, you are heading somewhere quite obvious.'

He denies four counts of indecent assault and a further seven counts of sexual assault while working at GSA, which is linked to the University of Surrey

The
 man said that seven years later, as he completed a Master’s Degree, he 
had once again gone to Campbell’s home and he said the teacher told him 
he needed to be spanked over the dinner table.

He said he told Campbell that it was totally unrelated, which Campbell accepted, and then they moved on to another subject.

The alleged victim recalled asking others in his class about spanking as a method used in singing coaching.

A
 classmate told him it would be completely inappropriate. The course 
leader, Chris Palmer, heard of the conversation and called him to her 
office to discuss it, he told police.

He
 said: 'She asked me how I mentioned spanking in class and where I had 
that perspective (from) and whether it was Ross Campbell who taught me 
this.

'I said: ‘Yes, that’s the only teacher who did this to me’.

'She made it absolutely clear it was inappropriate and was an act that could be considered sexual abuse.'

Mr Stork said that when Campbell was arrested police found material on his computer relating to spanking and corporal punishment.

The second victim told police that Campbell had put his hands inside his trousers during a singing lesson, without permission.

The final middle-aged alleged victim was urged to take private lessons with the snowy-haired defendant after being accepted on a Masters Degree course in the Practice of Voice & Singing.

It is claimed he told this student that he was going to have to work exceedingly hard if he was going to achieve anything and he would require a great deal of discipline.

'What he wasn’t expecting was that the discipline would include some pretty painful spankings,' said Mr Stork.

As part of the sessions Campbell was constantly putting the vulnerable student down and belittling him, said the prosecutor.

The jury was told that he thrashed the man with his hand across the buttocks after a particularly poor performance of the song Being Alive from the musical Company.

The spanking was quite painful and the victim started to cry.

On another occasion Campbell touched him inappropriately during a session.

The student initially did not report what had happened over fear that he would be thrown off the course.

When Campbell, of Farnborough, Hampshire, was arrested he made no comment in interview and handed officers a prepared statement.

He denied doing anything wrong and claimed that he had not done anything without the consent of the other party or that was not a legitimate singing technique.

He denied at any point being turned on or aroused sexually.

The trial in front of Judge Neil Stewart at Guildford Crown Court is expected to last seven days.

Campbell sat in the dock following proceedings with the help of a hearing loop.

The trial continues.
