Police have issued a new drug warning after a deadly batch of pills were seized and believed to have caused a number of deaths in Australia and overseas.

The light blue tablets are stamped with a Batman logo and sold as a form of ecstasy to drug users.

The pills were believed to be responsible for a number of bad reactions at a music festival in the Hawkesbury area of Sydney last weekend.

In a statement issued on Friday, police said the tablets contained dangerous levels of 25c-NBOMe, which is an extremely effective psychoactive substance.

The Commander of the Drug Squad, Detective Superintendent Tony Cooke said there had been cases in Australia and overseas where people affected by the NBOMe class of drug had died.

'We are aware of the Blue Batman pills and, in particular, a number of bad reactions users had after taking them at an event in the Hawkesbury last weekend,' Detective Superintendent Cook said.

'In fact, similar pills recently seized by police contained the drug 25c-NBOMe, one of the so called new psychoactive substances recently outlawed. A closely related substance was in fact involved in the death of a young man in Sydney last year.'

Detective Superintendent Cooke reminded people that they are putting their lives at risk every time they consume illicit drugs.

'Illicit drugs have been outlawed for a reason – they are very dangerous,' Detective Superintendent Cooke said.

'The reality is there is no quality control in the production of illicit drugs. You just do not know what you are taking.

'Illicit drugs are produced in filthy backyard laboratories by criminals with absolutely no interest other than making money. They will do whatever it takes to ensure a fatter profit margin can be achieved.

'That includes producing drugs and misrepresenting their true nature, cutting drugs with caffeine, washing powder, whatever, in a bid to get a better return on their sale.

'The health and wellbeing of their customer-base is simply not a priority.

'Anyone who is considering experimenting with illicit or synthetic drugs should stop to consider the possible consequences and not do it. It’s a gamble with your life that’s just not worth taking.'
