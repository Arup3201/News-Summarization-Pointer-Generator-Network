Banks must be stopped from pouring ‘petrol on the fire’ of Britain’s booming housing market, Vince Cable warned today.

The Business Secretary stepped up his warnings about the risk posed to the economy by a new property bubble, risking renewed tensions with George Osborne who has played down the threat.

The International Monetary Fund yesterday said global action was needed to prevent a repeat of the 2008 crash.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said he had been 'alarmed' at the size of loans some banks were willing to offer

Mr Osborne is expected to tackle the issue of house prices in his annual Mansion House speech later.

The Chancellor is due to back plans to free up more brownfield land for housing, insisting building more homes is the only way to tackle soaring prices.

But Mr Cable has pre-empted the speech, with a series of extraordinary warnings about the dangers of access to cheap loans.

He appeared to suggest ministers could interfere in the Bank of England’s independence by demanding action to cool the market.

The Business Secretary said he had been 'appalled' to discover the size of loans being agreed by some lenders and urged the Bank of England to use its powers to intervene.

Asked whether there should be a strict cap, the Liberal Democrat cabinet minister told BBC Radio 4’s Today: 'It is crucially important that the banks don’t throw petrol on the fire.

Chancellor George Osborne is expected to use his Mansion House speech  to address concerns about the housing market

'Most of us who have been through various housing booms in the past have recognised that a kind of stable level is three or three-and-a-half times

'I was appalled when I discovered that banks were lending five times.

'They have already reined it back on advice from the Bank of England but this is the key area that the Bank of England has got to operate in to make sure that this boom in house prices, particularly in the south of England, doesn’t destabilise the whole of the economy.

'The Bank of England gives guidance, hopefully steering the banks into making sure that the money goes into supporting small and medium-sized companies and getting long-term growth going rather than in fuelling house prices.

'That is the role of the Bank of England. They now do it in subtle ways but it is clearly their responsibility.'

Some banks have already moved to restrict lending - with Lloyds and RBS declining mortgages of more than £500,000 where that is more than four times earnings.

Mr Cable accepted that tighter restrictions would mean many in London could not afford to buy but said the interests of the country as a whole had to be addressed.

'The desires of individuals have to be balanced against the stability of the economy as a whole,' he said.

'I don’t want anyone to suffer but we have to make sure that the boom that is currently taking place in prices does not get out of control.' 

It follows a warning from the IMF that rising house prices around the world could threaten a new crash.

Min Zhu, deputy managing director of the IMF, said: 'Housing booms have different characteristics across countries and time periods. 

'What is common is that when the bust comes, it very often damages financial stability and the real economy. 

'The tools for containing housing booms are still being developed. The evidence on their effectiveness is only just starting to accumulate. The interactions of various policy tools can be complex.'
