If you've just been on the perfect date 
and think your new man with a flash car, stylish clothes and decadent house is too good to be true - he probably is.

A new survey has found that almost one third of men admit trying to pass off hired or borrowed items as their own just to impress their date.

The new findings have revealed that cars and clothing topped the list of the most frequently hired or borrowed objects, with one in six men admitting to temporarily obtaining these to entice potential partners.

Faking it: A third of men admit to hiring or borrowing items such as sports cars and fancy clothes to impress women on a date

Their efforts might be worth it however, as more than 40 per cent of women agree that the car a person drives can make them more attractive, while nearly 60 per cent agreed that a swish outfit would impress them.

Other lengths that men would go to included renting a house or apartment and even taking on a temporary pet to play up their emotional side.

It’s not just the men who are playing the game though as 1 in 5 women (19 per cent) also admit to renting or borrowing items to look the part.

The study, by Hertz, also reveals that the trend is more common among younger respondents, with 40 per cent of those between 18 and 25 confessing that they had invested to impress.

Respondents from Swansea were found to be the most likely to rent to woo their dates, with 43 per cent admitting to the practice, followed closely by Aberystwyth and Leeds.

Impressive: It's those men from Gloucester like Simon Pegg who don't feel the need to impress but the Swansea boys like Rob Brydon pull out all the stops when it comes to faking it

Conversely, Gloucester, Cambridge and Wolverhampton ranked as the least likely to invest to impress.

The survey also found that Lamborghinis topped the list of cars that people would most love to be driven in during a date.

Other desired supercars on offer include the Jaguar XKR-S, Range Rover Vogue Autobiography and Mercedes SLS AMG Roadster.
