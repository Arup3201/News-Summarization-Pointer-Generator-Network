A couple have been told their six-year-old daughter has a premature ageing syndrome that means she won't reach her teens - and their unborn baby has it as well.

Ella Barden, six, was diagnosed with Cockayne Syndrome in November after years of tests. The condition affects one in 500,000 people and sufferers have an average life expectancy of 12 years.

Now her six-months pregnant mother, Jodie, has discovered her unborn daughter also has the condition, after testing positive.

Parents Jodie and Luke have drawn up a bucket list for their daughter Ella

Jodie and her husband Luke, both 27, also have a two-year-old son Alex who doesn't have the syndrome.

The mother from Witham in Essex, said: 'We have to take it day by day and 
can't look too far in the future as it is just too upsetting and we have
got to try and keep positive.

'Somehow Alex will have to deal with losing two sisters.'

Cockayne Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder. Features include a failure to gain weight, an underdeveloped nervous system, small head size and extreme sensitivity to sunlight. Sufferers typically don't reach their teens and usually die from pneumonia.

Mrs Barden said: 'We are absolutely devastated. Everytime she gets ill you think, is this it?'

The couple first knew something was wrong with Ella when was nine-months-old. She had stopped growing and putting on weight.

She underwent numerous tests including two MRI scans but nothing was picked up for five years. 
Jodie gave up her job as a graphic designer last August to look after Ella.

In November, a geneticist at Great Ormond Street Hospital warned the family it could be Cockayne Syndrome.

Jodie said: 'I went home and Googled it and unfortunately it was fitting and I thought 'Oh my God' that might be it.'

Ella, who attends a local special school, can only say a few words and cannot walk.  There is no prognosis for how it will affect her in future but it is likely she will age prematurely.

Jodie and Luke have set up a bucket list of activities such as ice skating and swimming with dolphins which Ella can enjoy before she becomes too ill.

Meanwhile they must face the devastating fact that their unborn baby will also face an untimely death.

Jodie, who is due to give birth in April, said she decided to continue her pregnancy as: 'I would still have to give birth to my child and I would rather know I had given my child happy memories and given her a chance to love life and live it happily and to enjoy life.'

Ella's mother said: 'She is such a lovely girl and very loving'

She added: 'It is not going to be easy in the end and I have thought about that lots, endlessly,but at the end of the day I have still got to bear her either way.'

Jodie and Luke, a HGV driver, both carry the gene for the syndrome but are not aware of anyone in their families having suffered from it.

Jodie said: 'It is one small chance us meeting and both having the gene.

'We have been through the blame thing, but only blaming ourselves. We can't do that, we can't let everything fall apart.

'My worst fear in life, when we didn't know what was wrong with her, was we were worried if it was something absolutely devastating. Now my worst fear has been realised.

'We have got to deal with it and get on with it and try and keep positive. We have to stick together as it will make us stronger.'

Her family are raising money for the bucket list and to raise money for research into the syndrome.

'We have got to make memories with Ella,' said Jodie.

'She doesn't want us to be upset, she wants us to be happy. She is such a lovely girl and very loving.

'Everyday is special when you know it is coming to an end.'
