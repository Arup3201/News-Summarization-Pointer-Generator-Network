Saif al-Islam, the son of Colonel Gaddafi who was captured in November, has had the ends of his thumb and forefinger amputated as he prepares to face trial on corruption and war crimes charges.

Human rights groups have expressed concern over the treatment of the dictator's son, who has been held in solitary confinement without access to legal counsel since his capture by local militia in Libya.

Mr Gaddafi has since had the ends of his right-hand forefinger and thumb amputated in his prison cell due to injuries sustained in a Nato airstrike before his capture.

Medics had to remove the top knuckle of his thumb and forefinger because the injuries he sustained had become gangrenous.

Colonel Gaddafi's son also has an injury to his right middle finger.

The first of Mr Gaddafi's trials could be heard as early as next month, according to The Times.

U.S.-based human rights group Watch said Saif al-Islam has been cut off from the world during his 33 days in detention, with no access to his family or a lawyer.

News of the legal proceedings emerged as Colonel Gaddafi's daughter demanded an international criminal court inquiry into the circumstances surrounding her father's death.

Aisha Gaddafi, who fled Libya in 
August prior to the capture of her father by rebel forces, said she has 
suffered 'severe emotional distress' by pictures of his death and the 
treatment of his corpse.

In a
 letter to ICC prosecutor Jose Luis Moreno-Ocampo, international lawyer 
Nick Kaufman said Gaddafi and his son Mutassim 'were murdered in the 
most horrific fashion with their bodies thereafter displayed and 
grotesquely abused in complete defiance of Islamic law.'

The
 letter continues: 'The images of this savagery were broadcast 
throughout the world causing my client severe emotional distress.'

Mr
 Kaufman is said to have posed the ICC a series of questions, including 
whether they are investigating the circumstances of the deaths, whether 
it had received postmortem exam reports, and why the ICC had not ordered
 its own independent exam.

An
 ICC official, Phakiso Mochochoko, said last week Libyan authorities had
 promised to investigate Gaddafi's death, according to The Guardian.

Meanwhile
 the head of the rebel government council in Zintan, in the Nafusa 
Mountains in Western Libya, said Gaddafi's son is still being 
interrogated and 'is not allowed to talk to anybody' during this period.

Last month Foreign Secretary William Hague spoke out over the fate of the former dictator’s one-time heir apparent.

concerns have emerged that the former rebel faction that captured him is refusing to hand him over to the authorities in Tripoli, raising further doubts about the chances of a fair trial.

Asked if he backed the domestic trial decision, Mr Hague told BBC Radio 4’s Today: 'I would like to see him tried to international standards, whether that be in Libya or in The Hague. That is the important thing.

'The details of that have to be sorted out between the ICC and the transitional government.'

Officials in Zintan told The Times that Mr Gaddafi would be handed to the central government if a request was made.

The British Foreign Office said: 'We welcome the fact that the Libyan government is liaising closely with the ICC and we await details of where and when Saif will face trial.

'It is important that any trial is in line with international standards.'
