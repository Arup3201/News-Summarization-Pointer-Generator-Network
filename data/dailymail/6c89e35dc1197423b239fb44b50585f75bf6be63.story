Britain would be more at risk to terrorism if it leaves the European Union, Ed Miliband suggested today.

The Labour leader said it was 'much better working across borders' as he was questioned about the threat to the UK in the wake of the attacks in Paris which 17 people dead.

Labour was accused of 'distastefully' using the atrocities for political gain, as Downing Street announced police and security agencies are to carry out new training exercises to prepare for marauding gun attacks and hostage crises which last for days.

David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by 2017.

But Labour has not matched the promise of a vote, insisting Britain must remain in the 28-nation bloc.

Mr Miliband suggested that politicians who recommend leaving the EU risk making the country more vulnerable to terrorism.

The Labour leader, who was in Paris yesterday to show solidarity after the Charlie Hebdo attacks, said cross-border co-operation over security was crucial.

Speaking at a town hall-style event with voters in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Mr Miliband reiterated that he wanted the UK to stay in the EU.

'Think about terrorism and counter-terrorism. We are much better working across borders to do that,' he said.

'Think about our economy... I just think we are much, much better working within the EU than not.'

The comments sparked claims that Labour was trying to suggest a referendum would put public safety and national security at risk. 

However, a senior Labour source insisted Mr Miliband believes 'security is one of the issues where working across the EU shows its obvious benefits'.

The source added: 'We all remember from 7/7 that the European arrest warrant (EAW) played a vital role in bringing those suspects back to Britain. The EAW has been a very useful tool in dealing with security issues since it was introduced.'

Pressed on whether that meant politicians who wanted Britain to leave the EU were endangering people, the source said: 'I wouldn't back away from that interpretation.

'I think security is an important part of what the EU does.'

But Matthew Elliott, chief executive of pro-referendum group Business for Britain, said: 'It's pretty distasteful to insinuate that Britain's security would be put at risk by holding an EU referendum. A referendum is our best bet at securing lasting reform in the EU.

'If Ed Miliband is against giving people a say on Britain's membership of the EU, then he should be honest with the public about his reasons why.

'He certainly shouldn't try to scare them at a time when we need a grown-up debate about the serious threats to our national security, not hot air from politicians.' 

Mr Cameron today held talks with spy chiefs to step up Britain's defences against the threat posed by a 'fanatical death cult of Islamist extremist violence'.

Training exercises involving the police, military and security agencies will be adapted in the wake of the murderous attacks in France last week which left 17 victims dead.

Home Secretary Theresa May and Defence Secretary Michael Fallon were among the senior ministers who attended the briefing in Downing Street today

Home Secretary Theresa May and Defence Secretary Michael Fallon were joined by security agencies and Met Police chief Sir Bernard Hogan Howe for the briefing in Downing Street.

Mr Cameron asked the police and military to 'continue to work closely together' to ensure that the police, who lead on counter-terror measures, can call on military back-up when needed across the country.

Discussion centred on levels of preparedness for 'marauding' gun attacks, similar to those seen in Mumbai in 2008 when 164 people died in 12 shooting and bomb attacks over four days.

Police and security agencies 'regularly' carry out training exercises to test their response to a terror attack, including scenarios similar to the incidents in Paris, Downing Street said.

'The meeting agreed that for future exercises, the relevant agencies should identify whether there are any further specific elements of the Paris attack that should be built into the exercise scenarios.'

It is understood that particular focus has been on the way brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi moved from central Paris after carrying out their attack on the offices of the Charlie Hebdo magazine.

They are said to have spent a night in woodland before trying to return to the capital, before becoming holed up on an industrial estate in the small town of Dammartin-en-Goele.

Mr Miliband yesterday joined thousands of people on the streets of Paris to express solidarity with the victims of the Paris attacks

While thousands of French police were focussed there, Amedy Coulibaly took several people hostage in a Jewish supermarket in the Vincennes district of eastern Paris, stretching resources further.

British security teams are to assess their own ability to carry out large scale searches in urban and rural areas and react to the challenge of an incident which lasts several days.

A Downing Street spokesman said: 'The Prime Minister held a security meeting in Downing St this morning to review the Paris attacks and the risks to the UK of a similar attack.

'Following an intelligence update, they discussed the UK's preparedness for similar incidents. The relevant police and agencies regularly carry out exercises to test their response to a terror attack, including scenarios similar to the incidents in Paris. 

'The meeting agreed that for future exercises, the relevant agencies should identify whether there are any further specific elements of the Paris attack that should be built into the exercise scenarios. 

'The Prime Minister also asked the police and military to continue to work closely together to ensure that the police can call on appropriate military assistance when required across the country.

'They also discussed the risk posed by firearms, agreeing that our existing tough firearms laws are a very important part of the protections we have and that we should step up our efforts with other countries to crackdown on the illegal smuggling of weapons across borders.'
