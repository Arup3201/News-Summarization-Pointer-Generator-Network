A plus size model who once lost seven stone to be industry thin now makes it big as a swimwear model after deciding to put the pounds back on embrace her curves.

Eva Believer, 34, who lives in London but is originally from Lithuania, once embarked on a health kick that saw her lose seven stone in eight months.

But her resulting health problems made her confidence plummet until she put more than half of the weight back on and moved to the UK.

Now she loves her curves and has entered a beauty pageant exclusively for larger ladies

Once here she signed to a modelling agency and she is now happy to show off her curves. She has even entered a beauty pageant exclusively for larger ladies. 

The professional pianist, actress and singing teacher - who's a celebrity in Lithuania - said: 'When I was smaller I looked in the mirror and what I saw looked gorgeous but inside I felt dead.

'I had health problems and if I could turn back time I would never lose weight in such an extreme way again. I would try to live healthier and stay more positive about my looks, even it was hard to do.

'Now I feel more confident about myself every day.'

Having starred in Lithuania's  most popular daily TV sketch comedy show, Eva was a huge celebrity in her home country and was recognised everywhere she went.

But Eva hated her size 24, 18-stone frame, which wasn't accepted in her country.

Eva, who starred in a popular daily TV sketch comedy show and wass a huge celebrity in her home country, lost seven stone with free treatments in exchange for promoting an alternative health centre

Eva said: 'In Lithuania it is not acceptable to be that size. They don't even do clothes in sizes like 18 or 20, let alone anything bigger.

'I had to have my clothes made by a seamstress, which isn't always the best option. Not every seamstress knew the specifics of plus-size clothing making, sewing large size bags instead of dresses.

'My friends in Lithuania used to say people shouted abuse at them in the streets. I stopped getting it because I was famous, but I got a lot of abuse before my TV career.

'Most men wouldn't date me because of my weight. Even if he liked me a lot he'd still be ashamed to introduce me to his friends.'

While on a TV talk show Eva was approached by a health consultant who offered her free treatments in exchange for promoting an alternative health centre on talk shows and in the press.

Eva agreed and went on a strict healthy diet according to her blood group, and had a number of body cleanses and lipomassages.

She started losing the weight in September 2004 and in less than a year she had slimmed down to 10st 13lb and a size 8.

Eva put almost half of the weight back on, especially when she went on tour with her band

She said: 'In eight months I lost seven stone, but I had treatment on my skin to make sure it stayed taut.

'I looked wonderful and I went on all the shows to talk about my weight loss and I was published on many well-known magazine covers, but it affected my health badly, especially my gall bladder and bile ducts which literally stopped working.

'I had cramps down the right side of my body for 10 years, which made my singing career almost impossible.

'I was studying opera, but the muscle in my vocal cords was very low in tone and I couldn't hit the high notes.

'I was so embarrassed. I could see the reaction in everyone's eyes during my performance, thinking I couldn't sing but I just didn't have any power left and there was nothing I could do.

'Something went wrong, even walking took it out of me and I would have to stop for rests.'

And the slim results were not to last.

Eva started putting some weight back on in 2006, and finally stopped yo-yo-ing to plateau at her current weight of 15 stone, and she wears a size 18 to 20. 

When she started going to castings and signed her first contract she couldn't believe it

'I'm very lucky to do modelling and I always want to work hard to achieve the best results,' she says

She put just over three stone back on - almost half of the weight she originally lost - thanks to her convenience food habits especially when she went on tour with her band.

Shortly after, she moved to the UK, where she was shocked by people's positive attitudes.

She said: 'In England people I didn't even know would come up to me and say I was gorgeous and pay me compliments, but my confidence was so low I didn't believe them.

'I even went to an audition and the producer took one look at me, twirled me around joking and told me I was beautiful. I told him to get lost because I thought he was laughing at me because my confidence was so low. Now I'm not surprised I didn't get the job.

'When some colleagues suggested I look into modelling I was very sceptical. When I started going to castings and signed my first contract I couldn't believe it.

'It took such a long time to start loving myself, but even now I am very demanding on myself and the people I work with, especially on photo-shoots. I'm very lucky to do modelling and I always want to work hard to achieve the best results I am able to.'

Eva has now reached the final of Miss Plus Size International, a competition exclusively for larger ladies.

She said: 'I already knew Linda, who runs the competition, from the previous shoots we have done, and I started following her page on Facebook.

'I didn't think I was going to enter and then I had a change of heart and sent off some head shots just before the closing date.

'I am very happy to be where I am now, but I will never stop working on myself as it's so far to go, achieving more and chasing my dreams.

'I can't wait for the Miss Plus Size International finals. It's every woman's dream to at least once wear an amazing evening gown and to get attention on the stage.'
