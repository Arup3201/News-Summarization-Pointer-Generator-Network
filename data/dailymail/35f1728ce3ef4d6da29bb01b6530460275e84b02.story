Pardon the pun: but Jack Wilshere is a...Jack of all trades. But now, perhaps, he's found one he can master.

The Arsenal midfielder excelled in a deep-lying midfield role in England's excellent 2-0 win in Switzerland on Monday night.

Under Arsene Wenger, the 22-year-old has been deployed in various midfield roles - he's even been played out on the right-hand side in certain games last season.

New role: Wilshere was asked in the week to step into a deeper position for his national team

Versatile: The Arsenal man can play in any of the three central midfield positions at his club

Improving: The Arsenal midfielder was happy with his first game in the position, but wants to get better

He grew up as a No. 10, used in the area behind the strikers, where his ability to slip in intricate through balls destroys defences.

But the presence of Mesut Ozil and Santi Cazorla means he is way down the Arsenal pecking order to play in the 'hole'.

Then there's the advanced central midfield role, but Aaron Ramsey has that position on lockdown at the moment.

That leaves one position left in the Arsenal engine room: central defensive midfield. 

Attributes: Arsene Wenger believes his midfield man has the abilities to play further back

Strong: Wilshere has always been a player who can dive into a tackle, but can improve that part of his game

Covering: The 22-year-old midfielder was required to do a lot more defensive work against Switzerland

Wenger has been criticised by Arsenal fans for not signing a new deep-lying midfielder during the transfer window, despite strong interest in Sami Khedira, William Carvalho, Lars Bender and Morgan Schneiderlin.

But is there a method in his perceived madness?

As Sportsmail revealed in July, Wenger believes Wilshere has the attributes to play in that holding role.

The Arsenal manager has gone on record to say he prefers Wilshere in an advanced role, but the question is: does he get in Arsenal's full-strength midfield?

Arguably, not. 

Who needs a new signing? Wilshere can slot into the role Arsenal fans hoped would be filled by Khadira

But the one position he does have a chance of nailing down is that deep-lying role.

He certainly has it in the locker.

He's an accurate and economical passer, who, even at the age of 22, has an understanding of the game way beyond his years.

However, he does lack, to a certain degree, a physical presence. At 5ft 7ins he isn't the biggest, particularly compared to the likes of Premier League monsters Yaya Toure and Nemanja Matic.

But Mikel Arteta or Mathieu Flamini, his prime competitors for that role, aren't particularly imposing either.

So, until Wenger bites the bullet and signs a dominant central midfielder supporters so desperately want, then Wilshere has the opportunity to make that position his own.

The willingness is certainly there: 'I spoke with the manager and Gary Neville in the week and they told me they wanted me to play that role and I quite enjoyed it,

'It was my first time ever playing there, so over the next month or so I am going to look at a few videos of the game and of players who play in that position regularly - Pirlo, Mascherano and players like that and I'll get better.

'I felt it went well tonight but next time we meet up I feel it can only go better.'
