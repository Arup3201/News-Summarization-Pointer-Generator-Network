Modern-day cars now have more than 100 electronic parts from electric windows and heated seats to all-singing, all-dancing entertainment systems.

This may make driving easier for car owners, but as motors become more complicated, the skills required to fix them become more advanced. 

To tackle this, BMW has designed a pair of augmented reality glasses that show users step-by-step instructions on how to fix an engine, simply by looking at it - and you don't need previous mechanical experience to use them.

The glasses also show the wearer a picture of the tool needed to carry out the job, pictured in the bottom left-hand corner, and each tool is numbered to make this easier. The list of instructions can also be recalled by pressing the data button, top right

When
 a mechanic looks at the engine of a BMW, a 
3D colourful display is laid over the top of the original engine view.

The glasses are used to diagnose where the fault is and will take the wearer through step-by-step instructions to fix it.

At
 each point, the relevant engine part is highlighted and a written 
instruction is displayed in the top left-hand corner of the screen.

The glasses additionally come with headphones that can read the instructions out loud.

A
 3D animation will then play to demonstrate to the mechanic how to 
remove the relevant part.

In the bottom left-hand corner, the glasses also show a 
picture of the tool needed to carry out the job.

This is because animations shown via the glasses explain exactly how to disassemble car parts, and even which direction to turn a screw, for example.

The glasses are part of BMW’s wider Augmented Reality: The Extension of 
Reality project and the software includes various makes and models of 
BMW cars.

It can also be updated as more models are launched.

As
 BMW explained: ‘Using augmented reality, the mechanic receives 
additional three-dimensional information on the engine he is repairing, 
to help him in diagnosing and solving the fault.

‘Apart from the 
real environment, he sees virtually animated components, the tools to be
 used and hears instruction on each of the working steps through 
headphones integrated inside the goggles.’

Although
 BMW’s glasses 
have been created especially for its service engineers, developers at 
augmented reality firm Metaio created a similar app for Google Glass in 
September.

In 2007, BMW developed its own smartglasses that help mechanics fix cars using augmented reality. When a mechanic looks at the engine of a BMW, while wearing the glasses, a 3D colourful display is laid over the top of the original engine view, pictured

It also shows instructions through the device’s built-in 
visor and uses computer models to recognise and overlay the 3D content.

Metaio
 said it is also working on developing the software to run on other 
wearable headsets, including Epson’s Moverio range, and Vuzix models – 
both showcased at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

Trak Lord from Metaio told BBC Future: 'Say you’re driving down the road, and a light comes on. You can then load up that scenario, based on the symbols, in an app.'

'It could then tell the driver to open the engine [and] simply point their smartphone camera in the general direction of the problem.'
