He has been prime minister of Italy three times.

But now Silvio Berlusconi has gone one better, winning an Oscar - Italy’s first Academy award in 15 years.

The billionaire mogul’s Mediaset film company produced The Great Beauty, which picked up the coveted gong for best foreign language film in Sunday night’s awards.

Director Paolo Sorrentino credited everyone from Diego Maradona to legendary director Martin Scorsese for his victory with the film which reveals the empty worlds of decadent high society in Rome.

But Berlusconi was unable to attend the Oscars ceremony personally, due to a travel ban imposed last year after a conviction for fraud. However he appears at pains make sure his contribution to La Grande Belleza receives the recognition it deserves.

An editorial in the Berlusconi family newspaper Il Giornale crowed: ‘Silvio Berlusconi, founder and major shareholder in Mediaset, believed in Sorrentino’s project, produced and distributed the film.’

Berlusconi encouraged ambition in the making of the film and had no fear of investing his own money, it said.

‘He understood that cinema is a resource that had contributed to Italy’s successes, ’ it added. 

Left wing politicians who are trying to take the credit for Italy's victory are missing the point - the film is a criticism of their society, 'empty and hypocritical'.

Berlusconi’s eldest son, Pier Silvio Berlusconi, 45, who runs Mediaset, said that the family company ‘has supported Sorrentino since his first film, and remained at his side, believing in him and taking risks right up until the night of the Oscars.’

‘For us it has been a marvellous adventure’, he said. 

After his conviction for tax fraud last August Berlusconi was sentenced to one year’s house arrest or community service which he is due to begin next month.

His passport was confiscated, denying him access to his properties in the Alps and the Caribbean.

A request to leave Italy to go to a meeting of the anti-Europeans parties in Holland was refused on Tuesday.
