An autistic boy from Ohio has agreed to take the ALS challenge, only instead of ice water the unsuspecting teen was doused with a bucketful of bodily fluids and cigarette butts, according to his family.

The sick prank was recorded on the teen's cell phone, but according to the 15-year-old's parents and older brother, the boy was so embarrassed that he initially kept it a secret.

When his parents discovered the revolting video on the teen's phone, they decided to share it with the station Fox8 in order to raise awareness of bullying.

Unaware: This 15-year-old autistic boy from Ohio has agreed to take the ALS ice bucket challenge, not knowing that the teens who asked him to do it were playing a sick prank on him 

Humiliating: Standing in his underwear outside a garage, the teen was doused with a mixture of urine, feces, saliva and cigarette butts

Revolting: The victim had no ideas about the contents of the bucket until it was too late  

'Once we found out about it, we were just horrified,' said the teen's mother, who gave her name only as Diane to protect her son's identity.

The shocking clip shows the 15-year-old Bay High School student standing outside a private house wearing only his underwear when a bucket of liquid is poured on his head from the roof of a garage.

Only after the so-called ice bucket challenge was over did the autistic boy find out that he was splashed from head to toe with a foul mixture of urine, feces, saliva and cigarette butts.

His mother told the station that the heartless bullies used her son's phone to record the prank and then upload it onto Instagram.
