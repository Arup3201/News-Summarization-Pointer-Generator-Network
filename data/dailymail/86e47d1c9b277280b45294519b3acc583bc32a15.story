Freddie Flintoff has been confirmed as a contestant for the Australian version of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. 

While he was renowned in his heyday as a talented all rounder, Flintoff will be forced to take his skills from the pitch to the jungle after the announcement that he is one of two intruders entering I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!

He will be joined by 2009 MasterChef Australia winner and chef Julie Goodwin, while Miss Universe Australia 2008 Laura Dundovic is already in the South African jungle.

The news was announced on Channel Ten current affairs show The Project on Friday evening when the panel spoke to the 37-year-old live from South Africa before he joins his fellow camp mates.

After being asked if he was afraid of any of the wild life he may encounter during his time in the South African jungle, Flintoff's answer was simple: 'I'm scared of [cricketer] Merv Hughes!' he quipped, making the presenters burst in to laughter.

Adding: 'He's the biggest animal in that jungle!' 

‘We don’t get bugs and snakes in the north of England, so I think they'll cause me more problems then the eating challenges.’ 

He is however ready to take on the gruelling weeks ahead, saying he isn't afraid to eat any of the jungle cuisine, which so far has included bugs and pig snouts.

'I'll eat anything - I’ve travelled a bit in the past and I’ve eaten all kinds of different things' he said, before admitting it's wildlife he's most afraid of.

The humorous athlete teased that he was 'absolutely stupid' on joining the reality show, conceding that he was 'putting himself at the mercy of the Australian public' in reference to the famous 2005 Ashes series that he played in, which saw England defeat Australia in the series.

Flintoff, who retired from international cricket in 2009, revealed that he isn't quite comfortable getting his gear off on camera, saying that unlike his fellow contestant Tyson Mayr who is often shirtless on the programme, he won't be as confident.

'I'll be honest with you, if I had a bit of prior notice I might have got in the gym and tried to get the odd ab here and there. My rig isn't too good.' he teased. 

'I reckon if I sit next to Merv, Merv bumps me up to about a nine out of 10. If I'm next to Tyson, I'm probably about a 3!'
