Mystery: Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens handed over an explosive dossier about a paedophile ring working from Westminster but the names remain a mystery

The explosive dossier compiled by MP  Geoffrey Dickens is believed to be among  114 files ‘potentially relevant’ to child abuse now known to have been lost or destroyed by the Home Office.

In 1983 the Tory MP for Huddersfield West said he had eight names of 'really important, public figures' who unless they were arrested he would ‘expose  in Parliament’.

Based on his descriptions, these are thought to include MPs, civil servants, a diplomat and even a Buckingham Palace official. 

Some had links to the Paedophile Information Exchange, who wanted sex with children legalised, he said.

Dickens handed his '40-page dossier' to the then Home Secretary Leon Brittan, which set out allegations of a paedophile circle ‘operating and networking within and around’ the Westminster elite.

Another copy was kept by Mr Dickens' wife and another was allegedly handed to the then Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Thomas Hetherington and then the police.

All the copies vanished and nothing came of the investigations but now the Dickens dossier is central to allegations that there was a high level cover-up to protect those in power.

There has been speculation about who could have been named in it - MailOnline has considered who the MP could have implicated.

Politicians

Was Smith named? Cyril Smith, a notorious paedophile MP, may have been in the dossier

In August 1983, Geoffrey Dickens told the Daily Express that he had given the names of ‘eight prominent figures’ to the Director of Public Prosecutions.

He told the paper: ‘I’ve got eight names of big people, really important names, public figures.’ He said that, unless action was taken, he would ‘expose them in Parliament’.

He added: ‘One of these people is a friend of mine, but you have to be merciless protecting the young. These people must not be allowed to get away with it just because they are important in public life.’

That 'friend' may have been Peter Morrison, who was Mrs Thatcher’s private secretary despite being described by fellow Conservative Edwina Currie as ‘noted pederast with a liking for young boys’.

Morrison was also caught cottaging in public toilets with underage boys but instead of being pursued through the courts was released with a caution. He also went around public gardens 'cruising' for men to have sex with.

He died after a heart attack in 1995 aged 51.

In 2012 Rod Richards, a former Conservative MP and ex-leader of the Welsh Tories, said he had seen evidence linking Sir Peter Morrison to  North Wales children’s homes where up to 650 children were sexually, physically and emotionally abused over 20 years.

Another MP in the dossier was likely to be Cyril Smith, the Liberal MP for Rochdale exposed as a paedophile after his death.

Smith’s depravity knew no bounds and was probably known about at the very highest levels of the establishment, including the security services.

But the plight of his victims was ignored on the grounds of ‘political expediency’.

Police submitted files about Smith’s abuse of boys in his hometown of Rochdale in 1970, 1998 and 1999, but each time prosecutors recommended that no action should be taken against him.

A senior Tory politician was also said to be part of a Westminster child sex ring, although he has not been named.

The former MP was caught by customs with child porn videos after entering the UK at Dover after an official saw him 'acting suspiciously'.

The tapes showed children 'clearly under the age of 12' being forced into sex but when the materials were handed to his bossed the man was never arrested or charged.

Last night it emerged at least 12 men have come forward to accuse a Labour peer of abusing them when they were children.

The
 historical allegations against the man span several decades and include
 accusations of rape and other serious sexual assaults.

A
 source familiar with the police investigation said at least a dozen men had 
contacted officers to say they were abused by the peer, making a number 
of ‘horrendous’ allegations.

The
 peer, who the Daily Mail is not naming for legal reasons, has not been 
arrested or questioned in connection with the claims. It is not clear if he was known to Dickens.

The Palace Official 

Claims: Dickens told the News of the World in 1984 that a footman was abused by a royal official

Dickens' dossier is said to have made links between the Paedophile Information Exchange, a group that campaigned to make sex between adults and children legal, and an official who may have been linked to Buckingham Palace in some way.

Dickens told the News of the World in 1984 that there was a cover-up at the Palace and a young footman was abused by a a royal official, which was covered up.

The civil servant 

Dickens said that a senior civil servant was helping to run a paedophile ring from Whitehall.

The MP claimed the man had at least 57 obscene slides of men having sex with children. 

He said: 'I'm concerned about the cover-up of a senior civil servant who is a paedophile and wants sex with children legalised. He is a security risk'.

Secret life: Sir Peter Hayman had a double identity he used to rent a flat to keep child pornography

The diplomat

In 1981 he used Parliamentary privilege to name diplomat Sir Peter Hayman, a decorated diplomat who lived a secret life as a paedophile.

He was member ‘330’ of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), which supported and encouraged illegal sexual relationships between adults and children.

He rented a flat at 95 Linden Gardens, Notting Hill Gate, London under the name of Peter Henderson to store PIE literature and graphic correspondence with fellow paedophiles.

But Sir Peter made a mistake and left a packet of paedophile material in an envelope on a London bus. It was addressed to Mr Henderson at Linden Gardens in Notting Hill.Soon afterwards, in November 1978, police raided the Linden Gardens flat.

What they found there was a huge trove of paedophilia and other extreme pornography. Among it was a library of 45 substantial diaries in which Sir Peter had recorded in detail his sexual experiences and fantasies, the latter including sex with minors. Even the hardened cops of the Obscene Publications Squad were ‘revolted’ by the Linden Gardens haul.

He sobbed as he was interviewed and feared he would be exposed and his reputation ruined. And yet he wasn't. Much to the anger and disbelief of the Obscene Publications Squad he was let off with a caution. He died in 1992 aged 77.
