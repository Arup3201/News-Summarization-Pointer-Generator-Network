With all the time President Obama spends on the golf course, you'd assume he'd be pretty well practiced by now.

But according to Michael Jordan, the commander-in-chief still has a long way to go.

When asked about who he would want to play golf with, the basketball legend mentioned Obama but quickly changed his mind, calling him a 'hack' and a 's***ty golfer'.

He made the remarks during an interview for Back9 with sportscaster and former NFL star Ahmad Rashad, who asked him who he would pick for his 'foursome' in a round of golf.

Not a fan: In an interview for Back9, basketball legend Michael Jordan said he wouldn't want to play golf with President Obama because he's a 'hack' and a game with him would take too long

Umm: Sportscaster and former NFL star Ahmad Rashad asked him if he was sure he wanted to say that

First Jordan, 51, said he would choose golfing legend Arnold Palmer, and he then named Obama.

'I've never played with Obama, but I would,' he said, before promptly changing his mind. 'But no - that's OK - I'd take him out. He's a hack. I'd be there all day playing with him.'

'Do you really want to say that?' Rashad asked, looking at the camera, bemused. 'He's the President of the United States - he's a hack?'

Jordan added: 'I never said he wasn't a great politician. I'm just saying he's a s***ty golfer.'

The light-humored spat meant that Jordan never got around to naming his foursome - although he did have enough time to tell Rashad that he wouldn't be among the final four either.

Not up to par: President Barack Obama, left, who has played 200 rounds of golf since being in office, has a handicap of around 18, while Jordan, pictured right, has an impressive 3 handicap

Jordan is a pretty nifty golfer himself and has a 3 handicap, according toGolf Digest.

Obama by comparison 'strives' for a handicap of 18, Don Van Natta Jr., who tracks presidential golfing habits, recently told The New York Times. 

The president played his 200th round of golf while in office earlier this month - a staggering number considering Tiger Woods has played around 270 games in that time.

Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former President Bill Clinton and Republican House Speaker John Boehner have all teed off with Obama at some point. 

In fact, Obama has spent more time golfing  than he has spent listening to daily intelligence briefings, according to calculations by the Daily Caller.

Teed off: Obama has spent more time golfing than he has spent listening to daily intelligence briefings

They estimated he had spent around 700 hours at the briefings compared to 800 hours on 200 golf trips, considering the trips typically last four-and-a-half hours, although one lasted six.  

But even though his obsession has been the butt of Republican jokes, he's far from reaching the presidential record.

According to Van Natta's book, First Off the Tee, Woodrow Wilson was estimated to have played 1,200 rounds of golf in office, but it could have been as high as 1,600. 

Dwight Eisenhower is the runner-up at 800. He even set up a green outside the Oval Office and visited Augusta National so often that he got his own cabin on the club's grounds.
