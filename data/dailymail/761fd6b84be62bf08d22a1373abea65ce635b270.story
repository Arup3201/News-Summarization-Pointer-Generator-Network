Prominent Catholic leaders across the U.S. have threatened to turn voters against President Obama over his controversial plans to offer free birth control.

The fight is over a provision of the health reform law announced on January 20 that would require health insurance plans -- including those offered by institutions such as Catholic-affiliated hospitals and universities -- to offer free birth control including sterilization.

According to estimates, there are some 70 million Catholic voters – and many could be posed to vote against the president in the crucial upcoming election.

Speaking out: Archbishop Timothy Dolan, right, is one of many Catholic 
leaders who has spoken out against the health reform law that requires 
Catholic hospitals and universities to provide free birth control

Catholic League head Bill Donohue said: ‘Never before, unprecedented in American history, for the federal government to line up against the Roman Catholic Church,’ CBS New York reported.

'This is going to be fought out with lawsuits, with court decisions and, dare I say it, maybe even in the streets.'

Archbishop Timothy Dolan, who was promoted to the status of a Cardinal just weeks ago, spoke out about the issue.

'It’s not about contraception. It’s about the right of conscience,' he told reporters. 'The government doesn’t have the right to butt into the internal governance and teachings of the church,” he said.

'This is not a Catholic issue, it’s an American issue. We’re strong on this issue of conscience, and that’s what’s at stake here.'

Catholic clergy on Sunday called on the faithful to write Congress to protest new birth control rules from President Barack Obama's administration, stepping up a campaign that began a week ago with denunciations from the pulpit at Masses across the country.

Conservative columnist Peggy Noonan 
wrote in the Wall Street Journal this week that the contraception ruling
 could lose Mr Obama the election because the Catholic vote is 
concentrated in battleground states.

Condemned: The Catholic Church has traditionally condemned all forms of birth control, though 98 per cent of U.S. Catholics admit to using some form of it

The White House defended the policy, saying that only institutions such as hospitals that service a large non-Catholic community would have to offer free birth control. 

The administration also said the availability of birth control would reduce the number of abortions.

including those offered by institutions such as Catholic-affiliated 
hospitals and universities -- to offer free birth control including

'It’s

reporters.

'The government doesn’t have the right to butt into the 
internal governance and teachings of the church,” he said.

Considering the timing of the issue, there will likely be political fall out for Mr Obama who is hoping to get re-elected in November.

Mr Obama in 2008 won the votes of a 54 
per cent of Catholics, reversing a Republican majority of the Catholic 
vote won by George W. Bush in 2004.

While polls show a large majority of 
U.S. Catholics ignore church teaching against contraceptives - according
 to the Guttmacher Institute, 98 per cent of Catholics already use some 
form of birth control - Catholic clergy were outraged by the Obama 
ruling, viewing it as forcing Catholic hospitals and other services to 
skirt church doctrine.

Mr Obama in 2008 won the votes of a 54 per cent of Catholics, reversing a Republican majority of the Catholic vote won by George W. Bush in 2004. 

Catholics are about a quarter of the U.S. populations, with large blocs in such battleground states as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all won by Obama in 2008.

On the website of the U.S. Conference
 of Catholic Bishops, an 'Urgent Action Alert' was posted calling on 
Catholics to write to Congress protesting the rule.

At
 Immaculate Conception Catholic church in the Philadelphia suburb of 
Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, Monsignor David E. Diamond read the 
congregation on Sunday a letter from Philadelphia Archbishop Charles J. 
Chaput calling on parishioners to write to Congress in protest.

'Write
 them, call them, visit them - and help them understand the deep 
resistance of Pennsylvania Catholics to this dangerous ruling,' the 
letter said.

After Mass, John Fruncillo, 65, said he agreed with the clergy.

'I told my wife on the way out (of church) that it's about time the church started taking a stand on some of these issues.' said Mr Fruncillo, adding that he did not vote for Obama in 2008 and probably would not in 2012.

In Wisconsin, Barbara Schrawk said she voted for Obama in 2008 but was 'on the fence' this year.

'This should not be a political issue,' Ms Schrawk, 68, said of the birth control ruling as she entered St. Alphonsus Catholic church in the Milwaukee suburb of Greendale, Wisconsin.

In the battleground state of Ohio, Donald and Katherine Miller, holding their 5-month-old daughter Anne, compared the Obama administration ruling to forcing a Jewish kosher restaurant to serve pork.

'This is basically forcing Catholics to do something that is against their beliefs -- puts them in a place where they have to choose between violating God or violating the laws of the country,' said Donald Miller outside a Catholic church in Cleveland. He said Catholics should defy the law.

But some Catholics said the birth control dispute would not affect their support for Mr Obama this year.

Wally Brunelli, 70, said that while he opposes the use of contraceptives he would support Obama in 2012 as he did four years ago.

'Personally I feel as if this is something that the person themselves ... should decide,' Mr Brunelli said after church in the Milwaukee suburb.
