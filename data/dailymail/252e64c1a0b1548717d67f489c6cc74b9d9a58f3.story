A daughter stole her sick father's life savings to go on a £70,000 spending spree while he spent the last years of his life in a care home.

Lynne Waddle was given Power of Attorney over her father Ralph McAlpine after he moved to the home in 2006, and was supposed to spend his £100,000 life savings on care fees.

Instead the the 50-year-old, of Annitsford, Tyne and Wear, drew five-figure cash sums for herself which she spent on holidays and laser treatment over three years, Newcastle Crown Court heard.

Spending spree: Lynn Waddle was given Power of Attorney over her father after he moved to a home in 2006, and was supposed to spend his £100,000 life savings on care fees. Instead she drew cash for herself

Authorities launched an investigation after it emerged in 2011 that there was no money left to pay Mr McAlpine's fees.

They discovered Waddle had taken sums of up to £20,000 from her father’s accounts between 2007 and 2010.

By the time 77-year-old Mr McAlpine died last year, his care home was owed £17,000 - a cost which had to be met by the taxpayer.

Prosecutor Paul Wardlaw said: 'The police became involved, and in June last year they arrested Miss Waddle. She was too upset to be interviewed.

Sentence: Lynne Waddle, pictured outside Newcastle Crown Court, was spared jail

'In July she was interviewed and accepted, essentially, she had been on a spending spree.

'She had used the money belonging to her father for holdidays. for laser treatment and other things.

'In total she accepts she took some £70,827.'

Waddle pleaded guilty to theft.

Mr Recorder Barker sentenced her to 20 months in jail, suspended for two years, and 100 hours unpaid work.

He said he could take a 'merciful course' after hearing Waddle was the sole beneficiary of the cash and had no previous encounters with police.

Kate Barnes, defending, said Waddle had 'enormous respect and love' for her father and did not act out of malice when she spent the money.

Miss Barnes added Mr McAlpine had encouraged his daughter to have surgery on her eyes and had not objected when she spent money.

'She has lost her family through it,' Miss Barnes said. 'Her children are estranged from her having learned her involvement in this offence.'

The judge told Waddle: 'There is a public
 interest in maintaining the ingegrity of Power of Attorney, because 
when people lose the ability to control their own affairs it is 
important that others close to them have the ability to manage their 
affairs for them.

'It is important the Power of Attorney system is not abused and certainly not abused in the way you abused it.

'Theft of these monies constitutes a high degree breach of trust.'
