Tied to a colourful cloud of balloons, a South African man has floated five miles across shark-infested waters with only helium to keep him aloft.

In a scene similar to the Oscar-winning animation Up, Matt Silver-Vallance 
floated from the island where Nelson Mandela 
spent 18 years in prison over to Cape Town.

In the Pixar film, Carl Fredricksen strapped hundreds of equally bright balloons to his house to transport it from the U.S. to South America.

It took the 37-year-old about an hour to float across the Atlantic Ocean from Robben Island while harnessed to a mass of 200 multi-coloured balloons in grey, drizzly conditions with low visibility.

The goal of Saturday's trip from Robben 
Island was to help raise money for the building of a children's hospital
in the city of Johannesburg that will carry the name of the 94-year-old former president and 
anti-apartheid leader.

Mr Mandela, 94, was himself released from hospital hours after the daredevil flight, following treatment for pneumonia.

After taking off from Robben Island, the flight path ascended to 600ft above sea level and Mr Silver-Vallance  maintained this altitude for most of the flight.

1785 - French aviator Jean Pierre Blanchard successfully completed the first air crossing of the Channel, in a hydrogen balloon. It took two-and-a-half hours.

1909 - Pilot Louis Bleriot became the first to cross the Channel in a heavier-than-air aircraft, the Bleriot XI monoplane. It took 37 minutes.

1979 - The first human-powered aircraft made it across. American Bryan Allen used pedal-power for his three-hour journey.

2003 - Austrian sky-diver Felix Baumgarter completed a 20-mile freefall using an aerodynamic 'wingsuit' and a carbon fin. He took 14 minutes.

2008 - Swiss daredevil Yves Rossy reached 220mph using a jet-powered 'wing', and completed the crossing in less than 10 minutes.

2010 - Cluster balloonist Jonathan Trappe used 54 giant helium balloons to drift across, remaining airborne for three hours.

2012 - Jonathan Trappe launched a house into the sky just like in the Disney movie 'Up'.

At 2000m from the shoreline, he descended down to 400ft, and again at 1000m descend down to 200ft.

As he neared the shore the South 
African-born manager at a medical device company, dropped a rope near 
the coastline and a sea rescue craft pulled him to safety.

Mr Silver-Vallance wore a wetsuit and lifejacket as a precaution and a safety vessel accompanied the entire flight.

A powered paraglider pilot also followed the entire flight to continually update the Air Traffic and Navigation Service (ATNS) based at Cape Town International Airport of the progress of the cluster-ballooning flight.

In 2001, Mr Silver-Vallance joined
a medical device company that sold surgical instruments, and the Red 
Cross Children’s Hospital became one of his clients. It became clear to 
him that the hospital was under enormous financial pressure, as the care
provided, instruments purchased and staff salaries cost considerable 
amounts of money.

After 
moving to Rugby in the UK he decided he wanted to raise funds for 
charity by doing something risky and bizarre that would grab people’s 
attention.

It was then he decided to float from Robben
Island to the mainland, carried by balloons, and has been planning the 
stunt since then.

Mr Silver-Vallance co-ordinated the feat from the UK, engaging with international stakeholders and garnering support from around the world.

He had hoped to raise $1 million for the hospital, but organizers of the charity event have not yet announced the final tally.

On the fundraising website it says: 'This hospital addresses a great need; there are only four hospitals in Africa to serve nearly 450 million children. Millions of these children suffer from life-threatening illnesses and have little or no chance of receiving the specialised care they need.'
