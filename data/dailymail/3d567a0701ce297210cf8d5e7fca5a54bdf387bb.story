After a spectacular four-day wedding celebration, they were hardly going to settle into married life in anything less than the lap of luxury.

Fresh from their honeymoon, George Clooney and his British wife Amal Alamuddin have reportedly splashed out £10million on a stunning Grade II-listed manor house in Berkshire.

The elegant nine-bedroom Georgian mansion alongside the Thames affords the pair unrivalled privacy and luxury. 

The £10million manor house has reportedly been snapped up by George Clooney and his wife Amal Alamuddin after recent marriage

With its own library, gym, spa, steam room and wine cellar, the property has all the creature comforts that a star such as Clooney, 53, might have come to expect. 

And for high-flying human rights lawyer Miss Alamuddin, 36, it has the advantage of easy access to London.

The couple’s near–neighbours will include illusionist Uri Geller and Home Secretary Theresa May. Clooney is thought to have become interested in the area after visiting the nearby Buckinghamshire village of Fingest while shooting scenes for his film The Monuments Men. 

The ivy-covered property boasts a suite of elegant reception rooms with high ceilings, book-lined walls, chandeliers and open fireplaces.

The grand dining room inside the house believe to be the new home of Mr and Mrs Clooney, complete with traditional wood fireplace

If the couple need live-in staff or a gardener to maintain the perfectly manicured lawns, they will be able to house them in a separate cottage in the immaculate grounds. 

The house was bought at the end of last month through a privately held company. Clooney and Miss Alamuddin married in Venice last month, but they are said to have honeymooned in the local area. 

Last weekend they were spotted at a 500-year-old pub near their new home, setting tongues wagging. 

Retired designer Trishaws Redrup, 78, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘It was the vicar of our local church who told me. But to be honest I couldn’t quite believe it.’

The house is said to have been sold to a buyer on Thursday - but the vendor is yet to reveal who the new owners are

Reports suggest that George has purchased the  listed manor house in a quaint village  after he was spotted in the local public house

The previous owner has confirmed his property had sold but has refused to say who the new buyer to the expansive home will be

The nine-bed house features a library, gym, spa and steam room and boasts neighbours and has reportedly had more than a dozen CCTV cameras installed

It offers plenty of seclusion for the couple as it is set in four acres and is surrounded by dense trees and expansive gardens

The 53-year-old exchanged nuptials in Venice last month, where they were joined by high profile guests Cindy Crawford and Matt Damon
