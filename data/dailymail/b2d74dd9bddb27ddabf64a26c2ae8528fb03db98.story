Almost three in four people have no confidence that David Cameron will be able to deliver on his promise to claw back powers from the EU.

A poll has found that just 20 per cent think the Prime Minister can get a better deal with Brussels, while 72 per cent do not.

Some 51 per cent think other members will block reforms, while 26 per cent doubt the Prime Minister's skills as a negotiator.

A survey found three quarters of voters have no confidence that David Cameron will be able to deliver on his promise to claw back powers from the EU

And almost one in four suspects he wants to stay in the union even if Britain does not achieve a better deal.

The findings, which come from a major piece of research commissioned by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft, cast doubt on the electoral effectiveness of Mr Cameron's pledge of an in-out referendum by 2017.

Of the 20,000 people questioned, around two-thirds said other countries benefited more from the EU than the UK.

Some 49 per cent thought the drawbacks of being a member outweighed the advantages - compared to 31 per cent who said the opposite, and 20 per cent who were not sure either way.

The survey also suggested people had a more positive view of Russia than of the EU.

The European Parliament came fourth from bottom in a league table of 27 ‘liked' countries and institutions. Only Saudi Arabia, Iran and North Korea were placed below it.

Lord Ashcroft said: ‘Many like David Cameron's plan to negotiate better terms for Britain. The trouble is, three-quarters of them doubt it will work.'

Last night an important House of Lords committee called for a greater role for national parliaments in EU decision-making.

The Lords EU committee demanded a new ‘green card' procedure to enable groups of national assemblies to work together to propose new EU legislation or amend existing European law.

The report also says that parliaments, working together, should have the right to require proposed EU legislation to be withdrawn or substantially amended.

It emerged yesterday that the European Commission is to take Britain to court over its attempts to limit benefits payments to migrants.

The legal action centres on the ‘right to reside' test that European Union migrants must pass before they can claim benefits in this country. A lawsuit will be lodged ‘shortly' in the European Court of Justice, a Sunday paper was told yesterday.

Another poll out last night shows that only one in ten Tories trust Nigel Farage in Europe - suggesting UKIP's threat to the Conservatives may have run its course.

The poll, by YouGov and for the LBC radio station, shows there is growing support for Britain staying in the EU.

Some 45 per cent want to stay in - well ahead of the 34 per cent who said we should leave.

It comes ahead of this week's head-to-head debate between Mr Farage and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg on the subject of Europe.
