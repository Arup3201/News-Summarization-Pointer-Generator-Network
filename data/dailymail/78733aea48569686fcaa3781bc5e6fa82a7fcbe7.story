A competitor in the Arnold Classic Europe bodybuilding competition did a great job when he applied his fake tan – from the neck down.

His head literally paled in comparison to his super-bronzed body as he flexed his muscles for the judges.

The three-day fitness festival is named after bodybuilding legend and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who also hosted the event.

The competition is the European version of the Arnold Classic, the brainchild of Arnold Schwarzenegger and co-promoter and fitness legend Jim Lorimer, which has been running in the U.S. since 1988.

The pair was joined by Dr. Rafael Santonja, the president of the International Federation of Body Building (IFBB), to create the European version in 2011.

‘We have had many requests over the years to take the Arnold Classic to many cities throughout the world, and we are excited to begin the globalization of our event with the first Arnold Classic Europe,’ Mr Lorimer said last year.

‘Rafael Santonja has been one of our biggest supporters and we look forward to working together for many years.’
