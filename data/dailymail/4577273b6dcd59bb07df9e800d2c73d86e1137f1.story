American rapper Snoop Dogg took time out of his busy schedule to record a good luck message for the USA national team ahead of their World Cup campaign.

Jurgen Klinsmann's side face tough games against Germany, Portugal and Ghana in Brazil, but Snoop has called for The Stars and Stripes to go all the way in South America.

In a brief video posted to the Instagram account of Seattle Sounders star Clint Dempsey, the 42-year-old said: 'Shoutout to Clint Dempsey, the No 1 soccer player in the world, yes sir,
 and the whole USA soccer team. Good luck on the World Cup and bring
 it home.'

Dempsey was clearly delighted with Snoop's enthusiastic words as he posted a message alongside the video clip which read: 'Shout out to Uncle @snoopdogg for showing love, and @chehadetheking for making this happen.'

The former Fulham forward and his team-mates have been busy preparing for next month's tournament with a training camp in California ahead of a friendly clash with Azerbaijan on Wednesday.

Klinsmann's men then face warm-up fixtures with Turkey and Nigeria before departing for Brazil.
