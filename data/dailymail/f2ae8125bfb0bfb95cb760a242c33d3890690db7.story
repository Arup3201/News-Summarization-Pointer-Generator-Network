The government should tell people to use electric blankets to stay warm this winter, a former Tory frontbencher has suggested.

Baroness Rawlings urged ministers to launch a campaign extolling the benefits of electric blankets as ‘the answer to many of the government’s aims’.

She argued they are green, use little electricity and help to make homes for efficient.

Warmth: Ministers should launch a campaign telling people to use electric blankets, a former government frontbencher has suggested

It follows Downing Street advising people to wear jumpers if they get cold, before later insisting it would not tell people how to stay warm.

The government yesterday revealed plans to cut green levies by £50 on the average bill to counter claims it was failing to act on soaring costs.

The Big Six energy firms have agreed to pass on the reduction or freeze bills until 20915, provided wholesale costs do not rise.

But there are still warnings that with average bills still more than £1,400, many people will be forced to choose between heating and eating.

Baroness Rawlings, a former Tory MEP and government whip, said electric blankets are green and efficient

Responding to the government’s announcement on bills, Baroness Rawlings said she backed measures to make homes more efficient.

But she added: ‘Have the Government considered, as a simple, practical measure, encouraging people to use electric blankets?’

Baroness Rawlings, a former MEP and government whip, added: ‘They are the answer to many of the Government’s aims. They are very green as they use little electricity and they reduce the need for so much heating in the home.

‘They also make the home very energy efficient - that is, they cost less - which is what the Government seem to have as an aim.’

However, ministers are nervous of doing anything that risks looking like they are telling people how to avoid the cold.

Energy minister Baroness Verma sidestepped the question on electric blankets, telling the House of Lords: ‘As with all measures, we need to be able to ensure that people are kept warm and safe and that they are not paying over the odds for energy.

‘There are measures in the Statement and measures that we are already undertaking that will help energy efficiency and help consumers to reduce their bills.’

Energy bills will still be higher than last winter, even after the government agreed cuts to controversial green levies which will save customers £50.

Most of the Big Six had already announced rise of more than £100 this winter, before ministers moved to reduce the impact of government schemes designed to help the poor and vulnerable insulate their homes.

Yesterday British Gas said it will cut bills by £53 in January, SSE bills will fall by £50, while EDF said it would hold prices until 2015, but ministers admitted prices could still rise again.

The Government is cutting the cost of the energy company obligation (ECO), an insulation scheme delivered by major energy suppliers, in a move that should shave £30-£35 off bills, on average, next year.

The Department of Energy and Climate Change also announced it is establishing a rebate, saving the average customer £12 on their bill for the next two years.

Electricity companies will also take voluntary action to reduce network costs in 2014-15, funding a one-off reduction of around £5 on electricity bills.

In addition, energy firms will be given two years longer to hit targets on the insulation of homes, enabling costs to consumers to be spread out.

Wrapped up: Downing Street denied that David Cameron was urging people to wear a jumper

It is notoriously difficult for a politician to tell people how to do something as simple as keeping warm.

The risk is that even stating the obvious like putting on an extra layer leaves ministers, especially wealthy ones, of being out of touch.

In October a Downing Street spokesman said people struggling to pay soaring heating bills should 'consider' putting on a jumper.

After Labour leader Ed Miliband accused David Cameron of changing policy 'from "hug a hoodie" to "wear a hoodie", Number 10 rowed back.

A spokesman said  it was 'entirely false to suggest the PM would advise people they should wear jumpers to stay warm'.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey also admitted he did not know what temperature is own thermostat is set at at home because 'my wife tends to take care of that'.

But he went on: 'I am sure people wear jumpers. I wear jumpers at home.'

Sarah Newton, deputy chairman of the Tory party, produced an energy-saving guide for constituents telling them to shut their curtains.

In the 28-page guide, the Falmouth and Truro MP said: 'Close your Curtains: As the days grow shorter as winter approaches, closing your curtains at dusk helps to stop heat escaping through windows.

'This is a simple and free way of reducing wasted energy and your energy bills.'

And just yesterday a power boss sparked uproar by saying the amount of electricity families in Britain use is a ‘luxury’.

The extraordinary claim by Chris Train, a senior director of the National Grid, coincided with energy companies refusing to rule out more price rises.

Mr Train warned that providing ‘the luxury of electricity that we desire’ would mean customers paying billions more to upgrade the power network.
