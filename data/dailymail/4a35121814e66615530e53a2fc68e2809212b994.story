Healthy eating is good for you, no matter when you start, claim researchers.

They found middle-aged women who ate a Mediterranean diet lived longer and were healthier.

Cecilia Samieri, who examined data on 
almost 11,000 women, said: ‘Those with healthier dietary patterns at 
mid-life were 40 per cent more likely to survive to the age of 70 and 
over.’

They were also more likely to be ‘healthy agers’ with no problems in physical functioning, mental health or thinking skills.

Time to make a lifestyle change? A new study has found women on a Mediterranean diet are 40% more likely to live past 70

A Mediterranean diet is thought to 
improve heart health and help stave off cancer as it is high in fruit, 
vegetables, fish, nuts, whole grains and ‘healthy’ fats, and low in red 
meat and dairy products.

Dr Samieri and a team from Brigham and
Women’s Hospital and the Harvard School of Public Health, in Boston, 
used data from a major study that began in 1976.

They followed 10,670 US
women in their late fifties and early sixties who had no chronic 
diseases in the mid-1980s.

The women were given scores from 0 
(least healthy) to 110 (healthiest) based on how closely their diets 
matched a general healthy eating index, and scores from 0 to 9 based on 
how ‘Mediterranean’ their diet was.

Back to basics: A typical Mediterranean diet is rich in fruit, vegetables, fish, chicken and olive oil but is low in red meats and saturated fat

The team followed them to see how they aged up to 2000.

In all, 1,171 women, or 11 per cent, were healthy agers, the Annals Of Internal Medicine reports.

 Healthy agers had an average general diet score of 53.2, compared to 50.6 among usual agers.

On the Mediterranean diet scale, they scored 4.5 on average, compared to 4.3 for usual agers.

Healthy agers were also less likely to be obese or smoke and they exercised more in mid-life.

Dr Samieri said there was no reason to believe similar results would not be found in men.

Dietitian Joan Salge Blake said: ‘It’s never too late to improve on your diet and lifestyle.’
