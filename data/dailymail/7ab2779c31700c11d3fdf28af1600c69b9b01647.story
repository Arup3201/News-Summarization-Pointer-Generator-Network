Britain’s fastest snowboarder has released a death-defying video showing him being towed behind a commercial aircraft in Switzerland.

Jamie Barrow, who is on the British Snowboard Cross Team, reached speeds of 78 miles per hour during his world’s first feat at the Engadin Airport in Switzerland.

The inspiration for the stunt came from an old black and white photo of a skier being taxied by an aircraft in St Moritz Lake over 100 years ago, and as a result Barrow wanted to complete the feat at the same resort. 

The video footage was released following photos showing the 22-year-old's feat completed earlier this month.

Barrow had hoped to perform the stunt on the frozen lake of St Moritz, but after the ice was considered too unstable the operation was moved to the nearby airport.

Additionally, the initial plan also featured the plane taking off and pulling Barrow along while flying low, but again this was deemed too dangerous.

In order to complete the stunt a long strip of snow-covered grass running parallel to the runway had to be piste-bashed. 

Jamie Barrow, 22, became the first person to snowboard while being towed to the back of a commercial aircraft in Switzerland

The snowboarder was fixed to the PC12 aircraft via rope and a wooden handle, which he used to hold on as he was dragged behind

Timings also had to be considered as private aircraft were landing and taking off throughout the afternoon.

Towed by the PC12 aircraft with nothing more than a wakeboard cord attached to a wooden handle, Barrow was unable to communicate with Swiss pilot Duri Jos for the duration of the stunt.

Further complicating the already dangerous endeavour was the fact that Barrow was unable to snowboard directly behind the plane and instead was forced to board on its right-hand side.

As the plane accelerated down the runway the rope slack tightened and Barrow began speeding along in a remarkably straight and controlled manner. 

Due to safety concerns, Barrow was unable to snowboard directly behind the aircraft, so had to position himself off to the right

As the plane accelerated, the rope slack tightened and Barrow sped up along the snowy strip reaching speeds of 78mph

Onlookers held their breath as the aircraft powered down the tarmac, praying he wouldn't crash during the dangerous stunt

Keeping calm and composed Barrow continued on safely through to the end before effortlessly skidding to a halt once letting go.

And after completing one successful run, the adrenaline-junkie was keen to have another go. 

Following his first successful run, Barrow persuaded the pilot to allow him to complete two more for good measure

After his third run, which reached speeds of 78mph, Barrow celebrated with friends and family by giving his mum a big hug

Taking two more rides while hanging onto the aircraft, Barrow eventually reached the impressive 78mph speed, much to the delight of his family and friends.

An ecstatic Barrow chatted with press after the event, adding that he'd wished he'd been able to go even faster – if the pilot had taken off – and hinted that there could be a follow up stunt in the future.
