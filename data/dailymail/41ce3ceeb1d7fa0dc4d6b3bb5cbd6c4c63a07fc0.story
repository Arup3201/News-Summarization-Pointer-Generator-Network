It was one of the moments of the World Cup - a nation mourned as Brazilian poster boy Neymar was put out of the tournament after a crude challenge by Colombian defender Camilo Zuniga.

And now the shirt worn by the  full back when he caused Neymar's back injury can be yours to own from  auctioneer Bazar Sports, who claim to have got hold of Zuniga's shirt from the fateful night in Fortaleza.

The bidding started at $500 a week ago and is already up to $1400, with 11 days to go before the auction closes.

Getting shirty: You can guarantee yourself  the shirt worn by Camilo Zuniga  with a bid of $10,000

Agony: Neymar lies on the turf after suffering a broken back caused by Zuniga's late challenge

Where do you think you're going? Zuniga and Neymar clash in the World cup quarter-final in Brazil 

Bazar Sports clearly feels no shame about auctioning off the shirt and even adds: 'To all Colombia's and Zuniga's fans: Your Passion Lives On!'

Anyone interested in this slightly bizarre artifact  can end the auction and secure the shirt by bidding $10,000.

Party time: Neymar enjoys a night out with Paris Hilton as he took a holiday in Ibiza earlier this month 

Peace out: Barcelona forward Neymar has been hanging out with friends before the new season starts

Neymar recovered from the injury setback  by partying with friends in Ibiza, where he also found time to hang out with Paris Hilton.

The Brazilian forward is back in training but is not expected to be fit for Barcelona's opening match of the season, against Elche on 25 August.

Zuniga meanwhile will be looking forward to the new season with Napoli, and a chance to make himself known for something besides injuring the Brazilian talisman.      

Back to business: Zuniga has returned to Napoli and will be hoping to fire the Italians to glory this season
