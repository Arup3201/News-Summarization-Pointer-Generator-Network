Texas police are on high alert after a patrol car's anti-lock braking system was  sabotaged and two officers were apparently shot at in separate incidents in Houston.

A sergeant of  Harris County Precinct 7 was reportedly driving his 'take home' marked car this week when he noticed a warning light flashing, a force spokesman said. 

After taking the unit for repair, a county technician discovered someone had intentionally cut its anti-lock braking system - an act of vandalism that could have proved fatal in an emergency.

Also this week, two officers in the area have reported being fired at by members of the public in two separate incidents. Both were  in possession of marked vehicles at the time.

Alert: Texas police are on high alert after a Harris County Precinct 7 patrol car's (file picture) anti-lock braking system was sabotaged and two officers were apparently shot at in separate incidents in Houston this week

Now, Houston-based police patrolling in marked cars have been warned of the possibility of rogue attacks, according to ABC 13. They have also been advised to travel in pairs.

In the vehicle sabotage, the technician discovered two different ABS lines had been intentionally cut, leaving the car's basic braking system operational, but its anti-lock brake system useless.

'The maintenance technician, once he examined the wheel well, he realized that there was a cut in the line,' Pamela Greenwood, the Precinct 7 Constable's spokesman, told KPRC-TV. 

Ms Greenwood added that the loss of the anti-lock brake system could have put an officer’s life at risk during a high-speed chase or pursuit.

'All of our officers have been told to be on alert for attacks like this,' she told The Blaze. 'We got the word out to our deputies to be vigilant to make sure to check their equipment and vehicles before they get in and drive off. And we want to make other law enforcement agencies are aware.'

Meanwhile, in one of the shootings, a Harris County Sheriff's Office sergeant believes he was shot at while working his second job at Cypress Fairbanks Medical Center.

He said heard a gunshot in the parking lot outside the emergency room and went to check it out, at which point a man allegedly fired two more shots out of an SUV toward his marked car. 

The sergeant subsequently climbed into his patrol unit and gave chase, but was unable to catch the alleged shooter. However, he managed to get a vehicle description and the man was later arrested.

The apparent shooting was the second report of shots fired at a Harris County deputy his week. Details of the second alleged attack are currently unknown.

'Some people were saying the one incident had to be isolated because they didn't have any other incidents,' Houston Police Officers Union President, Ray Hunt, said. 

'Then when we found out about the second incident that had happened prior to ours, it's very, very alarming to us that in 48 hours we had two people, deputies, shot at in Harris County.'

It comes just two weeks after two police officers were fatally shot at point-blank range while sitting in their patrol cars in Brooklyn, New York, before the gunman committed suicide at a tube station.

The shooter had made statements on social media suggesting that he planned to kill police following two grand juries' decisions not to indict officers in the Eric Garner and Michael Brown cases.

He then crept up on officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos as they sat in the car near Myrtle and Tompkins Avenues in Bedford-Stuyvesant, before waking up to the passenger window and firing. 

The double killing came in the midst of nationwide protests over alleged police brutality. 

Police are investigating both of the alleged Houston shootings, as well as the vehicle sabotage.
