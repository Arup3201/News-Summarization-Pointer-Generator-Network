For those that know 70-year-old Larry Ekstrom, taking it easy on his birthday would be the unusual.

Opting to celebrate his milestone in a jumpsuit instead, the Madison Heights, Michigan man ceremoniously jumped out of an airplane 70 times in 10 hours on Wednesday and did it all for charity.

'I'd land, step out of harness, step into another, and go back up,' Mr Ekstrom told the New York Daily News.

Still got it: On Larry Ekstrom's 70th birthday he set a personal best record of skydiving jumps in one day, completing 70 in 10 hours for charity Leader Dogs for the Blind

Topping: Mr Ekstrom topped off his previous record of 60 jumps in one day which he completed on his 60th birthday

He said it took him eight different parachutes to complete his jumps while with the adrenalin rush dually raising money for the Michigan charity Leader Dogs for the Blind that provides seeing-eye dogs to the blind.

'My friend 
who works there is the manager,' Mr Ekstrom told WDIV. 'I thought this time would be a 
good one.'

Each jump started at around 2,000ft taking approximately two and a half minutes to touch down.

A group of staff members at Midwest Freefall Sport Parachute Center greeted him at his return, helping him suit up for the next one.

The plunge: Each jump started at around 2,000-feet high and took him approximately two and a half minutes to touch down

On his own: Completely unassisted, Mr Ekstrom has 46 years' experience skydiving, ticking off 13,476 jumps he said

Preparation: It took him eight different parachutes to complete his jumps

Success: His last series of jumps ten years ago raised $6,000 to combat multiple sclerosis he said, while adding it exhausted his pilot out before it did him

While Mr Ekstrom is an experienced skydiver with 46 years' experience under his belt - or 13,476 jumps to be exact - the amazing accomplishment wasn't all that unique to him, though it certainly was his personal best.

'I did 60 for 60 for my wife who has [multiple sclerosis],' he told WDIV of his series of jumps ten years' ago.

In all he said he raised about $6,000 to fight the disease from that day's jumps alone.

He said that if anyone became worn out from it all, it was his pilot.

Suiting back up: A group of staff members at the Midwest Freefall Sport Parachute Center were waiting below for him to help him strap up for his next one

Keep moving: Without pausing to get back in the plane, Mr Ekstrom told a reporter that what he was doing was any old milestone but proves somebody can do something

More to come? Mr Ekstrom said that he hopes to top his feat by completing 80 jumps on his 80th birthday

'I find out ten years later from the pilot that I wore him out,' he said. 'We had a good time doing it.'

Approached between jumps on Wednesday and asked his reasoning, he told WDIV: 'It's just another milestone and proves somebody can do something.

'See ya!' he cheerfully waved before getting back in the plane.

Mr Ekstrom said he hopes to break his record with 80 jumps on his 80th birthday.
