Cuddling up to her two dogs on a leather sofa, Iselin Rose Borch looks like any other teenage girl.

But Iselin Rose, 15, survived the Utoya massacre by hiding behind a rock while right-wing extremist Anders Behring Breivik gunned down young people at a summer camp, and says her pets have helped her to cope with the aftermath.

'In the period after Utoya I had a really hard time sleeping,' said Iselin Rose, who was rescued by tourists in a boat.

This photograph of Utoya survivor Iselin Rose Borch was among the collection that won Norwegian photographer Andrea Gjestvang the L'Iris d'Or photographer of the year prize in the 2013 Sony World Photography Awards. Miss Borch is seen with her pet dogs who helped her come to terms with the aftermath of the massacre by Anders Breivik

'I was afraid of the dark and suffered from dreadful nightmares.

'My mom and I decided that getting a dog might help me, so I got Athene. Now she sleeps on top of my stomach every night.'

The
 moving image is part of the One Day in History series of survivors of 
the July 22 2011 massacre, which has claimed the top prize in a major 
photography competition.

Breivik murdered 77 people that day in the worst peacetime attack Norway had seen. He first car-bombed a government building in Oslo, leaving eight dead and more than 200 injured.

He then made his way to a summer camp

gun, mowing down 69 and leaving more than 100 injured. 

Last
 August, he was sent to Ila Prison near Oslo for pre-meditated murder 
and terrorism to serve a 21-year sentence, which can be extended if he 
is considered to remain a threat.

Another
 survivor, Ylva Schwenke, is seen baring her shoulder to show her scars 
from being shot in the shoulder, stomach and thighs. She survived by 
hiding in the island's 'love path'.

She said: 'I bear my scars with dignity, because I got them standing for something I believe in.'
