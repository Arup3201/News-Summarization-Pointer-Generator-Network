Social media campaign: Lynda Hatcher, 49, took to Facebook to voice her concerns

Fed up at seeing the local shopping centre boarded up for years after Sainsbury’s failed to deliver its ‘regeneration’ plan, Lynda Hatcher sprang into action.

The mother of three took a photograph of the eyesore and posted it on the supermarket chain’s Facebook page, asking: ‘What are you doing?’

It was a question baffling the residents of Dorridge – not least because the village is where Sainsbury’s chief executive Justin King grew up.

Within 48 hours, her photo had been ‘liked’ by 500 people. So began a campaign by Mrs Hatcher which many in the village believe played a crucial role in shaming Sainsbury’s into building the store it had long promised them.

It was in 2008 that the company spent £18million on a large piece of land in  Dorridge, near Solihull, West Midlands, including the 1960s shopping precinct.

Two years later, it tried to get planning permission for a 25,000 sq ft store on the site but failed amid opposition from locals who felt it was too overbearing.

A smaller proposal was approved the next year.

But then, having helped traders relocate from the precinct, Sainsbury’s did nothing for over a year before declaring that its proposed supermarket was not commercially viable because of ‘continuing uncertainty’ in the economy.

By the time Mrs Hatcher took her photograph in February, there was growing discontent, with some villagers fearing Dorridge had fallen foul of ‘land-banking’ – the practice whereby supermarkets buy land to prevent rivals moving in.

The 49-year-old set up a Facebook page, customising the company logo to read ‘Shamesbury’s’, started a Twitter account @justinkinghome and launched an online petition.

Eventually, Sainsbury’s moved into action, obtaining permission for a larger store and workmen were seen at the site this week in readiness for demolition of the  precinct and the opening of a supermarket for Christmas 2014.

Yesterday Mrs Hatcher, a leadership coach, said: ‘I’ve never protested like this before but I was fed up at looking at a boarded-up site.

‘The supermarket plan was very divisive in the village from the start, but my own position was fairly  neutral towards it. Where I became very angry, and active, was that having got planning permission, I felt Sainsbury’s should build.

‘The promise was regeneration. There was a sense of betrayal when Sainsbury’s did nothing with the site for so long.’

Ian Spencer, chairman of  Dorridge Residents’ Association, said: ‘We asked Sainsbury’s what was going on and got fobbed off.

‘One wonders what would have happened if Lynda had not embarrassed the CEO.’

Sainsbury’s denied land-banking and blamed planning laws for the long delay.
