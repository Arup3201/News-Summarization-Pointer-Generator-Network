Muhammad Ali's boxing gloves worn for his 1971 fight with Joe Frazier have been sold at auction for £230,740.

The auction at Cleveland in the United States saw an anonymous bidder pick up the gloves which were worn during a bout known as the 'fight of the century.'

Frazier beat Ali by a unanimous decision to become the undisputed World Heavyweight Champion.

Historic: The gloves were bought by an anonymous bidder in Cleveland

In what would become one of the great sporting rivalries of all time, Ali later beat Frazier in 1974 and 1975 to gain revenge.

The fight had political as well as sporting significance, with Ali having been stripped of his title for refusing to enlist with the US Army for the Vietnam War.

A previous pair of Ali gloves from his first World Championship fight were sold for £496,980 by the same auction house.
