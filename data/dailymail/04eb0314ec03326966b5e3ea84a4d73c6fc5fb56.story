A pumpkin thief in Pennsylvania has restored a young boy’s faith in humanity after experiencing a change of heart and returning the giant squash to its rightful owner.

Nine-year-old Jaiden Newcomer had won the 255-pound giant pumpkin after correctly guessing its weight at a local Oktoberfest celebration near his home in York City.

The pumpkin was so large that it took four adult family members to lift it and a wheelbarrow to manouvre it when the family went to take it home.

Jaiden Newcomer, 9, had won the giant pumpkin - reported to weigh 220-pounds - after correctly guessing its weight at a local Oktoberfest celebration near his home in York City, Pennsylvania

Jaiden had been proudly displaying his prized possession on his family's front porch until it was stolen last week.

Amy Newcomer, Jaiden’s mom, admits the family though they had seen the last of the pumpkin and she assumed that someone had destroyed it. 

‘I never thought it would actually be returned,’ she told YorkDispatch.com.

Then on Sunday evening the family returned home after being away for the weekend to find the pumpkin had been mysteriously returned to their front porch.

Even more surprising, there was a note attached apologizing for the theft.

The note said: ‘I'm really sorry about taking your pumpkin, it was wrong of me, you earned the pumpkin, I didn't think my actions through nor realize who they were affecting. Sincerest apologies.’

Jaiden, 9, was so excited when he saw that his pumpkin had been returned that he rushed to check if it had a crescent moon to ensure that it was

Initially Jaiden wasn't sure that the returned pumpkin was the same one that had been stolen.

The stolen one had the shape of a crescent moon on it and so Jaiden rushed to examine the returned one to make sure it bore the same mark.

‘He ran there to make sure it was on there,’ she his mom. ‘He's very excited. He's beside himself.’

The thief's change of heart wasn't lost on Jaiden.

He told his mother that he wanted to use the pumpkins to 'make pumpkin pies for people who can't afford it, she said.

But since the pumpkin isn't meant for cooking, Newcomer said the family plan to buy pumpkin pies and donate them to a charity.
