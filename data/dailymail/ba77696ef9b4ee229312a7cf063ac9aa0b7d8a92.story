Bebe has revealed he thought Manchester United 'were joking' when they decided to meet Vitoria de Guimaraes' £7.4million valuation.

The Manchester United flop, who failed to impress following his move to Old Trafford in 2010, has admitted he was surprised when Sir Alex Ferguson brought him to the Premier League giants.

Bebe, speaking to Spanish newspaper Marca, said: 'I had a contract with a termination clause of €9m and within two days there was a team that wanted to pay it. And I went to Manchester. I thought they were joking.

'I learned a lot with Ferguson. What went wrong? Well, I was alone. I needed more experience to deal with that.

'In Manchester I was a child and was alone. I've grown and I am a better person, very different.'

The 24-year-old, who completed a permanent move away from Manchester United in the summer by signing for Benfica, is relishing the prospect of getting some game time under his belt during his loan spell at Cordoba.

Bebe has said he is 'happy and eager to give everything' after being shipped out on loan to La Liga strugglers Cordoba.
