The number of homes in which no one has a job has fallen by more than 600,000 since 2010.

Official figures out yesterday also show a decline in families living wholly off state handouts.

Along with a report last week showing record numbers in work, the figures provide fresh evidence that Iain Duncan Smith's reforms are nudging more welfare claimants into jobs.

The Work and Pensions Secretary's apparent success was obscured however by the fall-out of David Cameron's decision to quit by 2020 – and the continuing focus on politicians' kitchens. 

Official figures show 15.9 households have no-one in work, down from almost 19 per cent in 2010

Mr Duncan Smith's introduction of universal credit and a £500 a week benefit cap have been heavily criticised by the Left and the poverty lobby which claim families have been impoverished.

But yesterday's figures from the Office for National Statistics indicate the reforms are helping to switch large numbers of people from a life on welfare handouts to jobs and earnings.

The count showed that the number of jobless households with at least one working age adult fell from 3,763,000 in the last three months of 2010 to 3,149,000 at the end of last year.

The 16 per cent drop was a result of unemployed people finding jobs and the economically inactive – those previously uninterested in working – moving into the labour market.

The number of homes where no one has ever worked, the hard core of benefit-dependent individuals and families, fell from 275,000 in the final months of 2010 to 245,000 in the same period last year.

There were 372,000 fewer children in jobless homes than in 2010, and the number of children in families where no one has ever worked, over 302,000 at the end of 2011, was down to 221,000 at the end of last year. 

Mr Duncan Smith said: 'The primary aim of our welfare reforms has been to support everyone who is able to work into jobs, to give people the skills as well as the opportunities to be part of the economic recovery. 

And we've seen remarkable success – with an average of 1,000 more people in work for every single day that this Government has been in power.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the figures showed that almost 2million people are now enjoying the 'self-esteem and financial security that a job brings'

'In total, 1.9million more people with the self-esteem and financial security that a job brings.

'These figures reveal that the number of workless households has fallen by over 600,000 under this Government. Most significantly, there are 272,000 fewer households living in social housing without work.

'And the proportion in social housing where someone does now work with a breadwinner and a role model, is the highest since records began.' 

Mr Duncan Smith added: 'Behind these figures are countless stories of hard work and determination. By sticking to our long-term economic plan our welfare reforms are transforming the lives of some of the poorest families in our communities.'

The worklessness count came on top of last week's record employment figures and a zero inflation rate likely to be good news for families at a time when incomes are beginning to rise again in the wake of the recession.

A think tank founded by Mr Duncan Smith, the Centre for Social Justice, called yesterday for changes to the way child poverty is measured. It said that narrow financial measures of poverty are meaningless and have no bearing on the realities of children's lives.

The poverty line, usually put at 60 per cent of average income, is 'unrealistic, narrow and naïve', it said.

Christian Guy, the centre's director, said: 'Despite some outstanding recent progress on job creation and social justice measures, the official child poverty targets don't help the Government to change the lives of the poorest children.

'Poverty is about more than money. For too many families it is about addiction, worklessness, family breakdown, failing schools and debt traps.'

Last Wednesday, figures revealed that 73.3 per cent of working-age people are employed – the highest rate since records began in 1971.

The jobless total is 1.86million, the lowest level since the summer of 2008. The unemployment rate is 5.7 per cent compared with a European Union average of 9.8 per cent.
