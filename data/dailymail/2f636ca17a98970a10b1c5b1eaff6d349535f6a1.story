The wife of 'Captain Coward' Francesco Schettino has defended her husband in an Italian magazine interview, claiming: 'He is not a monster.'

Fabiola Russo spoke out as calls increased for prosecutors to widen their probe into the Costa Concordia luxury liner disaster, in which 16 people have been confirmed dead and another 16 people still are missing.

In an interview with glossy Italian weekly Oggi, she said there was a witch-hunt against her husband - who is under investigation for multiple manslaughter, abandoning ship and causing a ship wreck.

liner disaster in an interview in Oggi magazine

Schettino is currently under house arrest following the disaster which happened earlier this month, after he recklessly steered his 114,000 ton ship, carrying more than 4,000 passengers and crew, on to rocks close to the island of Giglio in a 'sail by' salute to impress a crew member.

Mrs Russo, who lives with Schettino and their 17-year-old daughter in Meta di Sorrento near Naples, said: 'My husband is not a monster. He was always the go to guy for the crew.

'I am the wife of a seaman, so I am used to doing things on my own. I tackle situations and I resolve them.

'This is a witch hunt, everyone is out to get my husband. The media has made out he is to blame.

'He loves ships, he knows all about 
them and has never stopped studying them, to learn what they are capable
of and what their limits are.

'He
didn't stop at just sailing ships. That's why for his crew he was 
always the go to man, a maestro. He is decisive, stable and lucid, he 
analyses situations, understands them and then acts.

'At times Francesco seems arrogant because he puts himself above the people he is speaking to and often tells them to shut up.

'He
wasn't in charge of the Concordia by chance, he knows how to do his job
but sometimes even those who know how to do their job can make mistakes
- that's if he did make a mistake.'

Extracts from the interview were also posted on Oggi's website along with a gallery of photographs provided by Fabiola, 48, among them a series of pictures showing her husband giving a safety demonstration when he was a captain with Renaissance cruise lines in 2000.

Others showed him at a desk in his cabin on another ship, or where was sat on a lifeboat of a tanker while working for American petrol giants Sunoco.

Amazingly she also revealed how they had once been fined for sailing too close to the shore in their sailing boat and added: 'What we really like is canoeing and to row together you need to be in harmony and my husband and I are.'

It comes as Beniamino Deidda, prosecutor general of Tuscany, the Italian region Giglio is in, called for attention in the investigation to also focus on the Concordia's owners Costa Cruises.

He said: 'For the time being the main 
focus of attention is the captain, who it has been shown was tragically 
inadequate but who chose him?

'The
lifeboats did not lower properly, the crew didn't know what to do, they
were unprepared in dealing with an emergency, wrong orders were given 
such as being told to return to cabins.

'The
confusion that has emerged shows that there was an incredible lack of 
attention to safety procedures. Safety should have been rehearsed 
beforehand.

'You cannot blame all of this carelessness on the conduct of the captain. That's why this investigation cannot exclude others.'

Today
the death toll rose to 16 as the body of a woman was found on deck 
three of the Concordia after a hole had once again been blown into the 
side of the ship.

The victim was found with a life jacket and her body was taken to a mortuary on the mainland.

The chaos in the bowels of the shipwrecked Costa Concordia is the worst Fabio Paoletti, a specialist cave diver, has ever seen.

The 43-year-old has pulled more than a few decomposing bodies from shipwrecked trawlers over the years, but has never had to tackle anything close to the size of the vast 17-deck Concordia.

He said: 'It is always scary, every time I go down to search the wreck, the unknown is frightening.

'Making our way through the debris is difficult and tiring. Visibility ranges from 30 inches to four inches, and we have to check everything - floating tablecloths, discarded clothes - for bodies.'

'Scary': Divers working in teams spend 50 minutes at a time searching the labyrinthine corridors of the Costa Concordia for survivors and victims

Divers work together in pairs for security reasons as they search the ship at a painstakingly slow pace, often having to squeeze into confined areas where the risk of becoming trapped is great.

They swim through the corridors and rooms in a zig-zag movement to make sure they cover every area.

Mr Paoletti said: 'We go down for 50 minutes at a time, with three oxygen tanks strapped to us, and leave one or two along the way in case we start to run out of air.

'If we're not back in that time, our back up races to find us.

'One of the biggest risks is that you get tangled up in electrical cables snaking in the water.'

The Concordia, which boasted four swimming pools, a spa, five restaurants, 13 bars, and an array of entertainment and shopping facilities, lurched on to its side when it hit rocks off the Tuscan coast on Friday, January 13.

So far, 16 people have been confirmed dead.

While the search for survivors among the 16 still missing officially continues, Mr Paoletti said he was not hopeful they could still be alive.

'If there was by a slim chance anyone down there knocking or calling out for help, we would hear it, but it's unlikely,' he said.

'Sometimes we think we've found a body, but it can just be a bundle, a jacket and a pair of glasses.'

The pairs use two head lamps to scour the freezing water and navigate an obstacle course of tables and chairs, as well as items left by terrified passengers as they rushed to evacuate.

The ship had 4,229 people on board from more than 60 countries when it hit rocks. The bodies, wearing life-jackets, have largely been found at emergency meeting points.
