Gary Neville had just returned from helping England begin their Euro 2016 qualification with a 2-0 victory in Switzerland, while Phil Neville, Giggs and Scholes had been busy at the SoccerEx Global Convention in the city.

With a shared interest in non-league Salford City FC, a hotel near Old Trafford and a football-themed restaurant there was plenty to discuss.
