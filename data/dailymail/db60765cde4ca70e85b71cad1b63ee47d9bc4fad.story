The woman who set the internet on fire last year by claiming to have three breasts has broken her silence to insist she's not a hoaxer.

Jasmine Tridevil became the subject of intense online scrutiny and doubt after extraordinary images suggested she had become the first woman in the world to have an artificial third breast fitted.

She has now spoken for the first time about the issue - defiantly claiming: 'I know my breasts are real and I do not care what anybody thinks.'

Defiant: Jasmine Tridevil has now spoken for the first time about her third breast, claiming: 'I know my breasts are real and I do not care what anybody thinks'

Many commentators claim the third breast is a wearable prosthetic - especially as she reported a '3 breast prosthesis' stolen when her bags went missing at Tampa Airport in 2014.

Breaking her silence for the first time, she added: 'Getting a third breast was not always my plan - I just had the idea two years ago.

'People always have something to say. They will criticize it or will love it and ask for a picture.'

Tridevil admits not all the attention she gets is complimentary, adding: 'If I go to a park where there are children, parents will give me dirty looks.

'But if I go to a bar it seems like everybody loves it.'

The aspiring pop-star claims the procedure cost $20,000 and took around an hour and a half to complete.

But she admits that she had encountered difficulty when trying to find a surgeon who would perform the procedure.

She added: 'There was one surgeon who hung up on me. I think that a lot of them thought I was prank calling them but I was serious they just did not take me seriously.

'There was another surgeon who told me I was crazy and said I should check myself into a mental hospital.'

She finally found a doctor who would perform the surgery but claims he made her sign a non-disclosure agreement meaning she can never reveal his name.

'The reason I got a third breast is because I wanted to make my self unattractive towards men,' added the 21-year-old.

'Sexually I just did not want to be approached by men anymore. So I got a third breast to make myself unattractive but I still wanted to feel pretty.

'I can still wear provocative clothing and feel pretty myself.'

The world's media descended on Tridevil's home in Tampa, Florida after the revelation but she refused to give any interviews.

She says: 'The world hates me I get nothing but negative comments.

'They think I'm an attention whore and it's true - I do love attention and I'm not ashamed of it because every entertainer is an attention whore whether they like to admit it or not.

'If they were not then they would not be famous.'

The dominatrix - who keeps male slaves and claims to have her name tattooed on to 11 men - has not spoken to her mother since the procedure.

She has had numerous calls to categorically prove once and for all that her three breasts are real - but as yet she has refused every offer.

'I could never consider doing a topless shoot - it's against the way I was raised,' she added.

The viral sensation - who is cashing in on her new found fame with a self-written pop song - Born to Serve - wants to keep on shocking the world with her outrageous lifestyle.

Jasmine added: 'I push the limits I do dangerous things. I never thought that I would ever change my body I was always happy with myself - I guess I just changed.'
