A historic property that is home to one of the most important Japanese gardens in the UK has gone on the market for £2 million.

Garden House in the east Hertfordshire village of Cottered is famous for its Oriental outdoor space that was created 100 years ago by a wealthy British china and glassware merchant.

Herbert Goode was taken with Japanese-styled gardens during a visit to the Asian country in 1905 and upon his return to the UK imported masses of plants from the Far East, such as bamboo, bonsai, wisteria, Acer trees, azaleas and dwarf conifers.

The £2 million price tag for the house in east Hertfordshire boasts a Japanese garden once called 'one of the best and most sympathetically kept gardens in the country'

Part of the Oriental-style gardens, which sit on some 2.5 acres of ground, include a Tea House on the property that was featured on a BBC Gardeners' World show

He then hired Japanese landscape designer Seyomon Kusumoto, who created over 200 such gardens in Britain in the early 20th century, with Garden House being recognised as his finest work.

Kusumoto incorporated an Oriental lake filled with koi carp, streams, bridges, water cascades, stone work, pagodas and archways into the 2.5 acre grounds.

After the property left the Goode family in the 1960s, a member of the family of the Tetley Tea empire bought it and built the two-storey, six-bed house that exists today.

The exotic gardens were then bought by a German family who turned the property into something of a tourist attraction by opening the gardens up to visitors.

Heritage specialist Richard Bisgrove in his 1970s book The Gardens of Britain said the property had 'one of the best and most sympathetically kept Japanese gardens in the country'.

It has been compared in date and character with the Japanese gardens at Bitchet Green, in Kent, and at Fanhams Hall, in Ware, Hertfordshire.

English Heritage described the east Hertfordshire property as having 'one of the most important early 20th century examples' of a Japanese garden in the UK.  

The unique home is currently owned by British couple Simon and Portia Rowlands who fell in love with it when they saw TV designer Laurence Llewlleyn Bowen present a programme from there in 1998.

The pair still open the grounds up to the public once a year, with the last event attracting 2,000 people in five hours.

Part of the gardens, which also feature a Tea House, are Grade II listed with English Heritage and were last year featured on the BBC's Gardeners' World show.

The current owners of the exotic Garden House opened the grounds up to the public once a year and said the last event attracted some 2,000 people in just five hours

The property has now gone on the market for an asking price of £1.95 million, with the option of retaining a full-time gardener who presently lives in a self-contained cottage being sold with the main residence.

Nuela Easter, of estate agents Hamptons International, said: 'This is the most famous Japanese garden outside of Japan.

'It quite astonishing to be in, it is like being transported to Japan.

'It is very private and secluded with all these little hidden areas to explore and surrounded by beautiful plants and trees of different shapes and sizes.

'It's funny because Cottered is a quintessentially-English village yet you could be in another world sat in this garden.

'There is an area of the garden that replicates Mount Sumo.

'The house was built to blend in with the landscape rather than detract from it.'

TV presenter Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen presented an episode of his show Changing Rooms from Garden Home which inspired a couple to buy the property

It is a piece of Japan in rural Britain that has passed through the hands of the wealthy and elite and later ended up as a tourist attraction. 

Herbert Goode, a merchant who traded in china and glassware, brought the Oriental touch of Japan to the Garden House in the village of Cottered in east Hertfordshire over a 100 years ago.

He had taken to the beauties of Japanese Gardens during trips to the Far East in 1905 and brought back masses of plants and shrubs from the Asian country.

The trader hired landscape designer Seyomon Kusumoto, who created over 200 such gardens in Britain, to bring about his vision of the Oriental grounds to the property.

After the house and grounds left the Goode family in the 1960s, a member of the family of the Tetley Tea empire bought it and built the two-storey, six-bed house that exists today.

The stately property and its oriental gardens later came on the radar of English Heritage – and in 1987 it listed Garden House in Cottered village as important to Britain's heritage.

The property was then bought by a German family who turned it into something of a tourist attraction by opening the gardens up to visitors.

It is now in the hands of British couple Simon and Portia Rowlands.

The pair fell in love with the house when they saw it featured on TV – on a BBC’s 'Changing Rooms' show presented by Laurence Llewlleyn Bowen from the home in 1998.

Now the soon-to-be new owners, be they wealthy elite or commoners like the rest of us, have the choice of taking on the garden duties themselves or keeping on the staff who tend to the grounds full-time.
