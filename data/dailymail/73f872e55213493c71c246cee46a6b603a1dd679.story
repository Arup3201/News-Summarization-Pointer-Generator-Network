It was her first starring role, but little Jessenia Henry played it to perfection.

At just two weeks old, she appeared as the infant Jesus in a pre-school nativity play, snuggled in a fleecy manger.

The rest of the 36-strong cast – aged between three and four – treated the tiny baby with great care as her parents looked on.

They volunteered her for the part after teachers at Dolphins Pre-School in Hove, East Sussex, said they were looking for a star turn.

Having a baby on stage has become something of a tradition at the school’s annual nativity play.

Headmistress Sheila Gavan said: ‘We always try to have a real baby and with around 70 parents attending, generally there will be a baby that’s small enough to fit in the crib.

'The children just accepted there was a real baby.

Ms Gavan added that the show was ‘really, really good’.

Around 80 parents came to watch the children act out the nativity story with some playing angels

‘The children absolutely loved it and were really enthusiastic,’ she said.

Jessenia is understood to have been well-behaved and did not cry during her time on stage.

At least using a real baby did not involve any health and safety precautions.

Last weekend a Mary and Joseph near Swansea had to wear crash helmets because their nativity play used real donkeys.
