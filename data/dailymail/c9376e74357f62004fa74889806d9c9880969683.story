A man who died in a shootout with FBI agents after kidnapping a 16-year-old girl and killing her mother and brother left money to her grandmother.

James Lee DiMaggio left $112,000 to Hannah Anderson's paternal 
grandmother after naming her as his life insurance beneficiary,  according to the family's spokesperson.

He didn't know why but believes it was for the benefit of Hannah, the girl abducted by DiMaggio.

Killed: Ethan Anderson, 8, was found dead

Hannah was rescued in the FBI shootout on Aug. 10 in the Idaho wilderness and returned home to San Diego.

DiMaggio, 40, had been like an uncle to the Anderson children and the father's best friend.

DiMaggio named Bernice Anderson as the sole beneficiary of his employer-issued life insurance policy in 2011, substituting her for his sister Lora Robinson, the lone survivor of his immediate family, Spanswick said.

DiMaggio lived with Bernice Anderson 
for about two years before buying a house in 2009 in Boulevard, about 65
miles east of San Diego, Spanswick said.

Authorities
found the remains of Christina Anderson, 44, and Ethan Anderson, 8, in 
the Boulevard house after it was set on fire.

DiMaggio's sister called Hannah's father, Brett Anderson, on Friday to tell him about the life insurance payment.

'They
had a long conversation about their mutual loss, trying to make sense 
of what happened, and neither of them had an explanation,' Spanswick 
said.

Time to grieve: Brett Anderson, the father of kidnap victim Hannah Anderson, 16, speaks to the media following his return to San Diego, California, on August 12, 2013

Tribute: Brett Anderson wore a T-shirt with the names of his wife and son on the back - whose bodies were found in DiMaggio's burning home

'Brett seemed to recognize that Lora was as much a victim in this as everyone else. He wished her the best.'

A spokeswoman for Brett Anderson and his family, Stacy Hess, declined to comment.

DiMaggio
worked as a telecommunications technician at The Scripps Research 
Institute in San Diego. Spokeswoman Jan Coury also declined to comment.

Steven
Weisbart, chief economist at the industry-backed Insurance Information 
Institute, said insurers generally won't challenge a claim unless the 
beneficiary is suspected of involvement in the death.

Investigators have given no indication that DiMaggio had any accomplices.

'Pretty much as long you're dead, the insurance company has very little opportunity to deny the claim,' Weisbart said.

Lora
Robinson has taken possession of her brother's cat, Princess, from 
Hannah Anderson, Spanswick said.

DiMaggio, a cat-lover, took Princess 
while on the run, and the cat was reunited with Hannah after the rescue.

Discovery: Police found DiMaggio's car, covered with brush and stripped of license plates, at a trail head at the edge of the Frank Church wilderness which triggered a massive search

Evidence: DiMaggio's car is towed away from the start of the trail where it was found
