With winter fast approaching the last of the lighter autumn days are drawing in.

And one photographer was able to catch fading hues of gold and orange as they battle through the oncoming mist in a collection of landscape scenes in North England.

Terry Roberts from Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire, decided to put the collection of images together to immortalise the beauty of the countryside he grew up in.

The 60-year-old said: 'The north of England has some world class landscapes, which are a photographer’s dream.'

'I always try to capture the moments of light and mood, as those really provoke a response.

'Often
these moments are in conditions which are difficult to photograph; 
during bad weather, high winds, snow and so on, but these are the more 
interesting images and the ones which please me the most'

Mr Roberts began the project seven years ago in an effort celebrate the landscape he fell in love with as a child.

'It’s clear from reactions that the landscapes of Northern England are indeed special, with a delicate beauty of their own.

'By drawing attention to our beautiful landscapes I hope people will treasure them all the more.

'Most tourists visiting Britain rarely see the beautiful North of England, and I hope my shots will help to draw attention to this part of the country.

'The Tour de France is due to visit Yorkshire for two stages in 2014, going through many of the areas I’ve shot.

'The area will receive attention which I hope will benefit the rural and local economy.'
