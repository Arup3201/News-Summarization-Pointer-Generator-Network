Four semi-professional English football players accused of taking part in a match-fixing scandal are so terrified that the ring-leader will send round 'friends to visit them' they are barricading their doors.

The quartet have appeared in court today in Australia accused of taking part in a £1.2 million match-fixing plot.

It is alleged the men were involved in a scam to fix the results of games they played in for Southern Stars Football Club in Melbourne, as part of a criminal syndicate with links to Europe and Asia.

The accused players are Reiss Noel (pictured left) Joe Woolley (right), Nick McKoy and David Obaze, who were allegedly part of a ring whose winnings are said to have totalled more than £1.2million

Former AFC Hornchurch players Joe Woolley (L) and Reiss Noel each face eight charges - four counts of engaging in, and four counts of facilitating, conduct that corrupts a betting outcome

Goalkeeper Joe Woolley, defenders Reiss Noel and David Obaze and midfielder Nick McKoy, who all recently played for teams in English non-leagues, each face eight charges - four counts of engaging in, and four counts of facilitating, conduct that corrupts a betting outcome.

Woolley, 23, and Noel, 24, were with AFC Hornchurch in the Isthmian League before moving to Southern Stars in July.

Obaze, 23, has played for a number of non-league clubs in England, most recently last season he was at Bishop's Stortford.

McKoy, 27, was also previously in English non-league football with several clubs including Tamworth and AFC Hornchurch.

Zia Younan, 36, the coach of Southern Stars, who is an Australian citizen originally from the Czech Republic, faces 10 charges relating to five matches.

Appearing today at Melbourne Magistrates Court, all five were granted bail on condition they report to police three times a week and do not attend any FIFA-sanctioned football matches.

Deputy Chief Magistrate Jelena Popovic ordered them to appear in court again on December 6.

Today the court heard the players have been barricading their doors at night because they are scared of the alleged ringleader, who is in custody.

Detective Acting Senior Sergeant Scott Poynder said two of the four Southern Stars players jammed chairs against their hotel room door for fear Segaran 'Gerry' Gsubramaniam, 45, would get people to 'come visit them'.

Mr Gsubramaniam allegedly passed on information from associates in Hungary and Malaysia - including a known international criminal fixer of sporting matches - to members of Southern Stars in exchange for cash, accommodation and rental cars.

The court was told the continuing investigation may potentially involve other Victorian clubs, as well in clubs in Queensland and overseas.

Mr Poynder said transaction records seized from Mr Gsubramaniam's home in the Oakleigh South district of Melbourne including ripped-up documents that were pieced together - indicated he had received around $230,000 (Australian dollars) from international accounts since July.

The Malaysian national is accused of fixing five Victorian Premier League matches involving the Southern Stars between July and September this year.

Mr Poynder said the accused sportsmen were professional players from the UK, playing in the amateur league during the European 'off-season', and were willing to give evidence against Mr Gsubramaniam, whom they claim was 'the main man'.

The court heard Mr Gsubramaniam made some admissions to police, but claimed he was 'a small fry' in the scam.

Mr Gsubramaniam was charged with five counts of engaging in, and five counts of facilitating, conduct that corrupts or would corrupt a betting outcome.

Each offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment.

Prosecutor Peter Rose opposed Mr Gsubramaniam's bail, alleging he may interfere with witnesses and was a flight risk because he had no ties to the country and potential access to large amounts of money.

Mr Poynder said he had discussed obtaining passports under another name in secretly taped phone conversations.

Defence lawyer Michael Gleeson said his client, who had no prior offences, should be bailed like his co-accused, most of whom were international citizens.

Mr Gleeson said there could be extensive delays in the case being heard given the breadth of the investigation and the fact this case was the first prosecution under new legislation designed to protect integrity in sport in the state of Victoria.

Mr Gsubramaniam's bail application will continue to be heard next Tuesday.

After today's court hearing Victorian police said more arrests were likely in the investigation into an alleged international football match-fixing syndicate.

Southern Stars have lost 16 games this season, drawn four games, but managed to beat the top side 1-0.

They are bottom of their league.
