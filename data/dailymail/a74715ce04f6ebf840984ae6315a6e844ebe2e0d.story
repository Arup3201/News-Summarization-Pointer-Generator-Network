Reputations count for so much in football and Howard Webb will appreciate that when he reads reviews of Sunday's Chelsea v Liverpool game.

When refereeing appointments are made the tenet 'big names for big games' is used and the key to these matches is getting the big decisions right.

At Stamford Bridge Webb failed to make the right call too many times despite being in excellent positions to see incidents clearly.

Man in the middle: Howard Webb was in charge of Chelsea against Liverpool but he got a few decisions wrong - like failing to send off Oscar (left) and Lucas (sitting down) when the two Brazilians clashed late on

Crunch: Oscar went flying into Liverpool midfielder Lucas at Stamford Bridge

Get a grip: Lucas let Oscar know he wasn't happy with the challenge and grabbed his opponent by the neck

THE KEY INCIDENTS

Contact: Eto'o clipped Liverpool striker Luis Suarez and brought him down in the penalty area

Going down: Suarez hit the deck after he was caught by Eto'o during Chelsea's victory over Liverpool

Ref justice: Suarez was fuming when Webb did not give a penalty for Eto'o's trip on the Liverpool star

Analysis of these incidents points to a poor performance by England’s leading referee but neither manager condemned him which supports Pierluigi Collina’s view of what makes a great man in the middle.

The Italian says that an official has a great reputation if he has earned the right to be regarded as a good referee who has made poor decisions rather than a poor referee.

That Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers wrongly attacked the referee after Liverpool’s previous game and Chelsea chief Jose Mourinho won the Champions League final when Webb was in charge will have helped. But Webb will still not enjoy reviewing the game.

Welcome to Chelsea: Samuel Eto'o's high tackle on Jordan Henderson happened early on

Another one slips through: Webb did not send Eto'o off for his nasty challenge on Reds midfielder Henderson

We are the halfway point of the season and Webb has refereed on 16 of the 19 Premier League rounds of fixtures, more than any other ref.

He is yet to award a penalty or send a player off in the top division despite having plenty of opportunities to do both.

It could be that World Cup selection is affecting him and he is perhaps trying to avoid controversy in the build-up to Brazil 2014 - the list of referees for the tournament will be announced in May.

Referees believe that you are remembered for decisions you make and not those you ‘miss’. That is only true for a limited period, as is a reputation for being a great referee.

Webb now needs to review his approach and prove one last tenet – form is temporary, class is permanent. 

@highlight

Howard Webb should have sent off Samuel Eto'o, Lucas and Oscar

@highlight

The ref should also have given Liverpool's Luis Suarez a penalty

@highlight

Webb hopes to be selected to referee at next summer's World Cup in Brazil

@highlight

He has refereed more Premier League games than any other official this season without showing a red card or giving a penalty

@highlight

Samuel Eto’o should have been dismissed for a shocking, high, studs-up challenge on Jordan Henderson after just two minutes.

@highlight

Chelsea should have been awarded a penalty when Lucas tripped Eden Hazard – despite Hazard moving his leg towards Lucas to ensure contact.

@highlight

When John Terry appeared to climb on Luis Suarez there were loud penalty appeals and Webb was for once not well positioned and waved them away. This time he was right as Suarez caused the contact by backing in.

@highlight

Liverpool should have had a penalty when Eto’o inexplicably tripped Suarez.

@highlight

Oscar and Lucas should both have been dismissed in the final few minutes when the Chelsea midfielder committed a two-footed lunging tackle on his fellow Brazilian who reacted by grabbing him by the neck. Incredibly Webb, who saw the incident clearly, indicated for play to continue with the ‘advantage’ signal. He was forced to stop play as the fracas escalated and eventually Oscar was cautioned.
