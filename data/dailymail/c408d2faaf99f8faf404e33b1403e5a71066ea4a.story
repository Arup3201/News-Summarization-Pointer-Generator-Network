Trapped in a cage and helpless, all this mother bear can do is watch as keepers take her three tiny cubs from her den.

Roused from her slumber keepers at the zoo in the Russian town of Lipetsk, south of Moscow, tempted the dosy bear with a pile of sausages.

These images reveal the heartbreaking moment the towering bear is left distraught, and trapped as the heavy metal door slams shut behind her, separating her from her young.

Keepers at a zoo in the Russian town of Lipetsk, south of Moscow, coaxed this towering mother bear away from her three cubs, shutting her in a cage

Once the keepers had managed to separate the mother and her young, slamming her inside a metal cage, they removed the tiny cubs one by one

The three male cubs were sold on for 20,000 rubles each

Suddenly realising what has happened the adult bear, Mosckwirchka, is seen scratching furiously at the floor and biting at the cage.

She is seen desperately trying to back inside the den, watching as the keepers take her cubs one by one.

The keepers were overheard telling reporters they were disappointed that all three bears were male.

Zoo director Aleksander Osipov, said: 'I have already found buyers for all three bears and they are now ready to go to the new homes.

But the zoo said they were disappointed all three cubs were boys. Male cubs are said to be harder to sell, because they are harder to train and control than female bears

'It was disappointing though because the male bears are hard to sell and you can only earn 20,000 rubles (£332).

'People complain that male bears are harder to train and control than female bears. If we had female bears we would have been able to sell them for 30,000 rubles (£498) each. 

He added: 'We decided we wanted to separate the cubs early from the mother because we already had buyers and there was a risk that if the father woke up he might attack and kill the cubs and we didn't want to risk that.'

Zoo staff said they decided to separate the cubs from their parents earlier than normal because they already had buyers

Zoo director Aleksander Osipov added: 'There was a risk that if the father woke up he might attack and kill the cubs and we didn't want to risk that'
