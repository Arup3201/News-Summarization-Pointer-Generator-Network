Their status as Victoria's Secret models makes them among some of the world's desired women but the modest ladies over at VS have turned things on their head and voted for who they think is sexy.

The What Is Sexy? List honors the hottest and most inspiring women in Hollywood and who the lingerie models believe embody a simple, casually confident lifestyle.

From sexiest street style to sexiest natural beauty, the women 
who made the list are all about maximum impact with minimal effort - no filter necessary.

But aren't THEY the sexiest women in the world? Victoria's Secret models, including Alessandra Ambrosio (front L) and Adriana Lima (front R), have voted for who they believe to be the hottest A-listers

Margot Robbie, who played Leonardo DiCaprio's love interest in The Wolf Of Wall Street, took the crown for sexiest actress.

The 24-year-old Australian rocketed to fame (and the top of every man's lust list) thanks to her seductive role in the Hollywood blockbuster.

The sexiest legs award went to Johnny Depp's 28-year-old girlfriend Amber Heard, who loves to show them off via slashed hemlines, while new kid on the block Lily Collins won best hair.
