Lord Ashdown yesterday appeared to compare Vince Cable to one of Shakespeare’s worst villains – as a poll revealed that Nick Clegg is the least popular political leader in modern British history.

The former Liberal Democrat chief hinted at the Business Secretary’s involvement in a ‘plot of deep malice’ to unseat Mr Clegg as the head of the party.

In an outspoken interview, he appeared to liken Mr Cable to Iago, the trusted adviser who betrays and then destroys his commander in Shakespeare’s Othello.

Popularity problem: A poll revealed that Nick Clegg is the least popular political leader in modern British history, as it was claimed that Vince Cable was involved in a 'plot of deep malice' to oust the Liberal Democrat leader

It came as a YouGov poll revealed only 13 per cent of people think Mr Clegg is doing a good job, while 78 per cent think he is doing badly.

Lord Ashdown, a staunch ally of the Lib Dem leader, fanned the flames engulfing the party by hitting out at internal  enemies who have ‘made a bad  situation worse’.

Last week Mr Clegg’s long-term adversary Lord Oakeshott resigned after it was revealed he leaked embarrassing private polls, which he paid for, to a newspaper and said the party was headed for ‘disaster’ under its current leadership.

As a parting shot he claimed his close friend Mr Cable, who was due back in Britain last night after a week-long trade visit to China, knew about the research which suggested the party would do better with a different leader.

The Business Secretary has strenuously denied trying to oust Mr Clegg. When asked whether Mr Cable was one of the plotters, Lord Ashdown, said: ‘He says not, Nick says he wasn’t, so let’s leave it at that, we have to accept him at face value.’

But pressed further on his suspicions about the Business Secretary’s role, he warned cryptically: ‘One of the rules of politics is choose your Iagos carefully.’

Shakespearian intrigue: Lord Ashdown, a staunch ally of Clegg, fanned the flames engulfing the Lib Dems by hitting out at internal enemies

Mr Clegg will attend a showdown meeting with the party’s MPs, peers and council leaders tomorrow night, as Lib Dem activists have begun circulating a motion of no confidence in him.

Top of the Lib Dems’ agenda is likely to be the infighting which has followed their disastrous performance in the local and European elections, in which they lost  about 300 councillors and 11 of 12 MEPs.

Lord Ashdown confirmed reports he had threatened to castrate Lord Oakeshott if he made ‘difficult days for the party more difficult’ after the elections.

He told BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show he said to the peer: ‘Matthew ... I will first of all remove your head and then your testicles’, if he made matters worse – but said it was meant as a metaphor.

He urged the party to put aside its differences before the general election. ‘What has happened after these elections has made a bad situation worse,’ he said. ‘We now know there has been a plot of deep malice to try and remove the leader.

‘I have got a very clear message for the party, and that is anything you do now which is not getting out on the streets campaigning in the context of the next general election ... is a distraction and a dangerous distraction.’

Lord Oakeshott’s resignation letter, which savaged Mr Clegg’s leadership, escalated the crisis by making bombshell allegations that the Lib Dems are involved a cash for peerages scandal.

Scottish National Party MP Angus MacNeil, who exposed the original cash for peerages affair in 2006, has over the weekend written to the Metropolitan Police asking for an investigation.

Adding to Mr Clegg’s woes is the attempted comeback of Lord Rennard, the party’s former chief executive, who was suspended over claims he sexually harassed a string of women.
