A military transport plane flying in bad weather has crashed into a mountain in Morocco killing 78 people.

It is the country's worst ever air disaster.

The C-130 aircraft had been carrying 60 members of the military, 12 civilians and nine crew when it crashed in mountains north-east of Guelmim this morning.

Wreckage: Deadliest plane crash in southern Morocco which killed 78 people on board

Officials say the crash in the disputed Western Sahara region of the country was the deadliest in years.

Information Minister Khaled Naciri said the military believes 78 were killed but that searches are ongoing for all the bodies.

The MAP news agency said all three survivors were seriously injured.

MAP
said the plane crashed around 9am local time, seven miles north-east of
Guelmim in southern Morocco, as it prepared to land at the Guelmim 
military air base.

MAP said the crash was 'due to bad weather conditions,' without elaborating further.

Naciri said the plane was en route from 
Dakhla, in the disputed Western Sahara, to Kinitra in northern Morocco, 
and making a stop in Guelmim.

Officials at the military hospital in Guelmim could not be reached.

Guelmim is more than 360 miles 
south-west of the capital Rabat, just north of the Western Sahara and a 
few dozen miles from the Atlantic Coast.

Morocco
took over the mineral-rich Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony, in 
1979. However the Saharawi people want to establish the region as an 
independent state

UN peacekeepers have been there since
1991, and the UN has demanded a referendum but Morocco has instead 
proposed wide-ranging autonomy for estimated half a million people who 
live in Western Sahara's sparsely populated desert flatland.

The
Guelmim region features contrasting desert, oasis and mountain 
landscapes with their valleys and gorges, part of the so-called 
Anti-Atlas, an extension of the Atlas mountain chain that runs through 
Morocco.

The region also features a coastal zone known as the 'White Beaches of Guelmim' with the beach in nearby Tan Tan.
