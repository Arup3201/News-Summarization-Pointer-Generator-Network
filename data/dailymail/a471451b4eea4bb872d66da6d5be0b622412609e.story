The manager of a care home where five pensioners died of neglect was handed a new job looking after the same home by the firm that took it over, it emerged today.

Sarah O’Mara was personally criticised for failing to take responsibility for medical blunders and staff shortages at an inquest into 19 deaths last week.

A five-week investigation heard about hundreds of medical errors at the chronically under-staffed Orchid View in Copthorne, West Sussex.

Vulnerable residents were given wrong 
doses of medication, left soiled and unattended due to staff shortages 
and there was a lack of management.

Ms O’Mara moved on when the £3,000-a-month home was closed by healthcare firm Southern Cross in 2011.

But
just a few months ago she was appointed a regional director for Care UK, which has taken over Orchid View and re-named it Francis Court, which meant she was left in charge of the home.

Ms O'Mara has now left her position at the company after Care UK conducted a review following the inquest last week.

On
her LinkedIn profile Ms O’Mara boasted of a 'consistent record of 
improving quality care delivery' and 'sound commercial judgement 
delivering profit-driven results'.

But
the inquest heard call bells were often not answered for long periods 
or could not be reached by elderly people living at the home.

Acting manager Alison Paris told the inquest she never saw Ms O’Mara, who did not answer or return calls.

The
Care Quality Commission said it was 'appalling and disgraceful' that 
residents were not supported by nurses and managers at the home.

And one inspector said conditions were worse than anything she had seen in her 28-year career.

Giving evidence, Ms O’Mara denied claims she did not make enough visits to Orchid View.

But the coroner said: 'I haven’t heard you take responsibility at all.'

Ms O’Mara replied: 'I was their manager. I supported whenever I was needed and went to the homes when I was needed.'

West
Sussex Coroner Penelope Schofield concluded: 'There was 
institutionalised abuse throughout the home which started at a very 
early stage. Nobody did anything about it.

'This
was from the top down. It was completely mismanaged and under-staffed 
and failed to provide a safe environment for residents.

'It is disgraceful that it was allowed to run the way it did for nearly two years.

'What concerns me is that many of those involved are still working in a similar role in the industry.

'Sadly this means there could be another Orchid View somewhere else.'

The coroner said 19 residents at Orchid View suffered 'sub-optimal' care and all of those residents died from natural causes.

But the coroner ruled that abuse and 
neglect contributed to the deaths of Jean Halfpenny, 77, Wilfred 
Gardner, 85, Margaret Tucker, 77, Enid Trodden, 86, and John Holmes, 85.

Healthcare campaigners  criticised Ms O’Mara’s re-appointment.

Ian Christian, of Irwin Mitchell solicitors which represented seven residents' families, said: 'The management void within Southern Cross was shocking and something that cannot be allowed to happen again.

'When someone in Sarah O’Mara’s position can fall so far below what’s expected and walk into another job it shows a woeful gap in the regulation of the industry.'

Barry Pickthall, of disability campaign group Don’t Cut Us Out, added: 'I just despair at the lack of managerial control. It’s just extraordinary.'

Ron Harley, Unison regional manager, said: 'It’s not appropriate that a senior manager should continue in her role until there’s been a full investigation into the allegations.

'If Care UK were sensible and serious about this they would not allow her to stay in a position of responsibility for such vulnerable adults.'

A Care UK spokesman Ms O'Mara and another employee, Mark Cash, were no longer working for the company following a review into the coroner's findings.

The spokesman said: 'Care UK initiated a review into the Coroner’s findings immediately after the inquest concluded on Friday, to address in particular any observations by the Coroner that concern the conduct of any of Care UK’s current employees who were previously involved in the Southern Cross management structure responsible for the Orchid View home.  

'What concerns me is that many of those involved are still working in a similar role in the industry. Sadly this means there could be another Orchid View somewhere else'

- West Sussex Coroner Penelope Schofield

'Subsequently, both Sarah O’Mara, 
appointed by Care UK as a regional manager in July 2013, and Mark Cash, 
appointed by Care UK in March 2013 as a regional operations director, 
have left the company.  Neither now works for Care UK.'

The inquest heard resident Jean Halfpenny overdosed on the blood thinning drug warfarin after staff failed to monitor and administer her medication properly.

Whistleblower Lisa Martin, who worked as an administrator at the home, was asked to shred forms after Mrs Halfpenny had to be admitted to hospital for bleeding.

The 'final straw' for Ms Martin came when she was told by a nurse that they had found 28 drug errors from just one night shift. She called police who arrived the next day.

Five people were arrested, including some on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence, but insufficient evidence existed to support a prosecution and the case was passed to the coroner.
