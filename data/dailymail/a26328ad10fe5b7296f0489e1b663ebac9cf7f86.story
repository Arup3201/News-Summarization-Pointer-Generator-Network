As Alexis Sanchez celebrated his first Premier League goal against Leicester on Sunday afternoon, he probably wasn't aware of its significance.

The Chilean's effort, which flashed past Kasper Schmeichel to give the Gunners the lead at the King Power Stadium, also made him the 100th player to score for the north London side in the Premier League era.

It was the £30million summer signing's second goal for the club, following on from a priceless winner against Besiktas in the Champions League play-offs.

All smiles: Sanchez's goal made him the 100th player to score for Arsenal in the Premier League era

The former Barcelona star joins an illustrious list of players to have found the back of the net for Arsenal since the Premier League began back in 1992.

Club legend Thierry Henry leads the way in the goalscoring stakes, having netted 175 times during his eight-year career at Highbury and the Emirates. 

In second place, but miles behind the Frenchman, sits Ian Wright with 104 league goals to his name, while Manchester United striker Robin van Persie is third having scored 96 times before leaving for Old Trafford in 2012.

Other names near the top of the Gunners' list include Dennis Bergkamp (87 goals), Robert Pires (62 goals), Emmanuel Adebayor (46 goals) and Cesc Fabregas (35 goals).

Sanchez joins a group of 19 players to have scored a single league goal for Arsenal, with the likes of Gael Clichy, Kieran Gibbs, Carl Jenkinson, Nacho Monreal and Serge Gnabry each having celebrated just one top-flight strike in the red and white.

There will surely be more to come from the Chile star, however. 

Despite Sanchez's goal being a piece of history it was not enough to seal a win for Arsenal at Leicester as Leonardo Ulloa earned Nigel Pearson's side a share of the points with a fine header.
