At one time, they might have left a pig’s head on the doorstep.

But these days the Neapolitan mafia are increasingly employing ferocious and exotic animals, including crocodiles and tigers, to terrify their victims into paying their protection money, police say.

Some bosses have been known to threaten victims by putting snakes in their car windows, while other clan members employ parrots as drug dealers.

Sinister: In a scene worthy of a Bond film police confiscated a crocodile from the home of the nephew of a mob boss in Orta di Atella, outside Naples

In a scene worthy of a Bond film police confiscated a crocodile from the home of the nephew of a mob boss in Orta di Atella, outside Naples.

It was used to scare businessmen who had not paid their protection fee or ‘pizzo’, due three times a year at Christmas, Easter and August Bank holiday, police said.

The entrepreneurs would be weighed and then left on the terrace to keep the vicious beast ‘company’.

‘Pay up or you can be his next meal’, the business owners were told, according to Forestry police officials.

Terrifying: One Mafia godfather ordered that a Siberian tiger be chained up outside his villa

Another group of heavies in the mafia-torn town of Villa Literno, instructed to send a warning to a debtor, left a ten foot boa constrictor in his car.

The same thing happened to a policeman, soon afterwards, when a python was put through the window of his moving car in an apparent response to an operation a few days before.

In the Traiano area of Naples police seized a pair of African grey parrots which has been trained to act as drug pushers

One godfather ordered that a Siberian tiger be chained up outside his villa. Another in the Avellino area near Naples placed a cage with two macaque monkeys in the middle of the room where he met his businesss associates.

In the Traiano area of Naples police seized a pair of African grey parrots which has been trained to act as drug pushers. 

When a phone rang they would respond ‘Hello. How much do you need?'  

In stressful situations or when someone tried to take them out of their cage they would say, I’ll shoot you'.

All the seized pets now live in a refuge for animals in judicial custody where they have 'a complete zoo, A-Z', police vets said.

Police chief Marco Trapuzzano said ‘Recently the traffic of dangerous animals has reached frightening levels.

‘The Camorra are using animals such as snakes as their weapon of choice to intimidate people. Tigers, alligators, monkeys, snakes they are all used as a sign of power. 

'They are a demonstration that the bosses can do whatever they want- even own ferocious animals that are feared by others. 

‘The rarer the animal the more omnipotent the boss feels because it would be risky for someone to attack him at his home.' 

Prices rang from £400 for a boa with special colours to £24,000 to import a Siberian tiger, he said.
