A new type of 'legal high' could be developed into a drug that can help to stop people from binge drinking while still giving them a buzz.

The inventor, who was also behind the banned substance mephedrone, has filed a patent application for the substance through a dutch charity.

The drug, known as MEAI, gives users a feeling of intoxication similar to the party drug ecstasy while limiting the amount of alcohol they drink.

Chapron drugs could help curb the binge drinking culture by removing the desire to drink during a night out

Now scientists at Imperial College London are hoping to use the compound to develop what they are calling a 'Chaperon' as a way of tackling the binge drinking problem.

Around one in ten deaths in working age adults are due to excessive alcohol use and it accounts for 3.3 million deaths a year worldwide.

Journalist Michael Slezak is among the few to have tried the potential chaperon drug MEAI.

Despite the risks of taking an unlicensed and untested drug, he decided to try 5-methoxy-2-aminoindane after asking scientists to conduct a few toxicity tests.

During a night out drinking with friends he took a small dose and then began drinking two hours later, slowly upping his dose of MEAI as he did.

After four hours he said he began to feel a relaxed high. More than five hours after the first does, he said he felt 'intense but controlled euphoria'.

Writing for New Scientist he said that at that stage 'the idea of drinking alcohol seems repuslive - as does eating bar food'.

He said: 'My friends later described my behaviour as rational, if a little tense.

'The drug didn't stop me from sleeping and I had no anxiety or depression in the following days. So it seems like a party drug without some of the side effects.

'My experience is not a scientific study. It took a lot of the drug to make me want to stop drinking and by then I felt both drunk and high.' 

Professor David Nutt, a psychopharmacologist at Imperial College London and a former Government drugs adviser, now believes Chaperon drugs that reduce the desire to drink may provide a way of tackling the problem.

He believes MEAI is a potential 'binge mitigator' that could be taken at the start of a night out to kick in after a couple of hours to remove the users desire to drink anymore while still giving them a pleasurable feeling that makes people want to drink in the first place.

The drug's designer, a mathematician known by his pseudonym Dr Z, has agreed to gift the patent to Professor Nutt's charitable research group DrugScience, to help fund research on Chaperons.

Professor Nutt told Mail Online: 'The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recently signed off on a drug called Selincro for use by alcoholics as it stops the loss of self control they suffer from.

'That got us thinking about another way to approach the problem which would be to take away people's desire to drink.

'What tends to happen is that people go out for just a couple of pints but after having them something changes in their brain and they then end up drinking far more than they intended, causing them to end up in trouble.

'We are looking for ways to stop this switch from flipping in the first place. We are looking at around 80 substances and MEAI is one of those.'

Many of the potential chaperon substances being investigated by Professor Nutt were previously patented as drugs to treat other conditions such as depression but failed to ever make it to market.

He said they were now hoping to repurpose these compounds for other uses.

MEAI was developed by Dr Z (pictured), the drug designer behind several legal highs including mephedrone

Mephedrone was sold over the internet as plant food before it was banned after being linked to several deaths

So far around 40 people, including its inventor Dr Z, have tried MEAI but no laboratory tests or clinical trials have been carried out.

One person said they did not enjoy the experience while others have said it made them feel euphoric.

Some have reported losing the desire to drink within around two hours of taking the substance.

One journalist for New Scientist who has tried MEAI said it took five hours before drinking alcohol became 'repulsive'

Also called 5-methoxy-2-aminoindane, MEAI is a ring shaped compound known as an aminoindane. 

It is structurally similar to two other 'legal highs' invented by Dr David Nichols from Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indianna - MDAI and MMAI - that mimic the euphoric effects of ecstasy.

Binge drinking is a major problem in many cities at weekends but it can also lead to long term illnesses

However, MEAI also looks like another drug, PMA, which is known to be highly toxic.

In neurotransmitters, just a small change to the structure and chemical groups on a compound can produce dramatic differences in how they work.

Currently drug laws in Europe and North America only ban the use and sale of specific substances.

This means new compounds developed by chemists can be sold without fear of prosecution until they are added to the list of controlled substances.

In many cases, production of these new drugs is currently outstripping the ability of the authorities to keep up by making them illegal.

The growing problem of legal highs came to the public's attention following a series of deaths among users.

Taking a chaperon drug similar to MEAI at the start of a night out could stop people from drinking too much

Mephedrone, created by Dr Z and sold over the internet as plant food, caused at least one death and has been implicated in at least 13 others.

However, there are some who believe these new substances could provide new forms of treatment if tested properly.

Professor Nutt said he hopes to conduct scientific tests on chaperons in animals before attempting clinical trials to see if it could be useful.

'We are hoping to do testing in animal models and build up to clinical trials,' said Professor Nutt.

'However, all of this costs a lot of money and we need to raise funding for it, which is what we are hoping the MEAI patent will help with.'

Speaking to New Scientist, he added: 'We have to see this as an opportunity to reduce harms rather than a new drug that has hit the market.'

However, Dr Nichols warned that it was difficult to predict how drugs like MEAI would behave in the brain and whether they might also do more harm than good.

He told New Scientist: 'There really is no good way to predict biological activity in a completely novel structure.'
