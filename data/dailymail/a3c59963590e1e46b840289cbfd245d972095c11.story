An amateur explorer from Edinburgh has begun a 60-day mission living on a remote island off the coast of Scotland stuck inside a converted eight-foot water tank.

Nick Hancock is hoping to set two endurance records by living on the 100ft island of Rockall and raise £10,000 for the Help for Heroes charity.

But as he started his mission, he admitted his wife Pamela told him she and their 18-month-old son, Freddie, didn't want him to go.

Rockall is situated 225 miles west of the Outer Hebrides chain and is constantly pounded by 3,000 miles of Atlantic swell.

Nick Hancock, a 38-year-old chartered surveyor from Edinburgh sets off on his 60-day mission to live on the remote Scottish islet of Rockall inside the yellow, eight-foot converted water tank

Hancock used a diesel-powered winch to lift his homemade 'rockpod' on to the Kilda cruise boat. The journey to the Scottish islet of Rockall - 225 miles west from the Outer Hebrides - took 12 hours. The eight-foot converted water bowser was fitted with hatches and fixing points so Hancock can fix it island's rocks

Explorer Nick Hancock will be taking nearly half a tonne of equipment with him during his 60-day stint on the islet of Rockall, including:

60 days' food

Fishing kit and bait

Pants and socks x 10

Comfy shoes

Insect collection kit

Normal LW radio for news

Weather station

Brass Plaque

Whisky and cask

Emergency water maker

Lip balm

Binoculars

Loo rolls (average of one per week)

Ear plugs

Harmonicas and lesson book

Flags

Sunglasses

Satellite phone

Laptop

The world's largest recorded oceanic waves of over 95 feet were recorded there in 2000 - 19 feet higher than Rockall itself.

Because Rockall is so remote only four people have ever slept on it and less than 100 people have ever landed on it.

But Mr Hancock, 38, a chartered surveyor, created a yellow living pod from an eight-foot water tank, and made it cosy with spray-on insulation foam in a bid to spend 60 days on Rockall.

He recently won £3,500 from the Kukri Adventure Scholarship - following a presentation at the Royal Geographical Society in London - to help his bid.

The current record for time spent on 
Rockall is 40 days, back in 1985 - when ex-SAS soldier Tom McClean lived
 on the rock from 26 May to 4 July - to affirm Britain's claim to the 
islet.

Mr Hancock, who previously stayed for a shorter expedition on the islet, hopes to break the record on the rock to raise money for Help For Heroes.

Hancock said from his home town of Ratho on Thursday: 'Decision made - we're going for Rockall today.

He plans to spend 60 days on the island inside this eight foot water tank that he converted

'I am ready for what lies ahead - both mentally and physically, but it is more a mental challenge.

'I am as prepared as I can be. I have enough rations and I am looking forward to it and setting new records for Rockall.

Yet Mr Hancock isn't planning to make a habit of these adventures: 'It may be the last! Who knows?

I'm just concentrating on this one for now. Landing on it is tricky.'

The journey to the islet takes around
 12-hours and Mr Hancock, a climber and marathon runner, was ferried 
over there aboard a boat from local operator Kilda Cruises.

Hancock used a diesel-powered winch to lift the 'rockpod' onto the boat, he will then bolt it onto the islet to secure it in place.

'It's a converted water bowser which has been fitted with hatches and fixing points so I can fix it to the rock.

'I have a daily routine of exercises and safety checks, and I'm also going to be carrying out some sample collections for St Andrew's University and the Hunterian Museum.

Hancock admitted he did not want to be 'stuck' inside his survival pod too much but the weather may force him to.

He can only walk a few feet outside of the narrow ledge his home will be on.

Rockall is a formidable opponent for any adventurer, located 225 miles west of the Outer Hebrides and surrounded by choppy water

'I will exercise and I am taking an 
exercise band for resistance training,' said Mr Hancock.

'I will also 
have a lot of ebooks on my laptop to read.

'I feel confident that I am ready for this amazing adventure.'

The majority of Hancock's equipment and supplies were packed into plastic drums and were donated by Smiths of Dean.

Before the trip, Hancock said: 'I fully expect that I will have to repack several times to ensure I know where everything is, but otherwise I feel confident that I will be ready in a month's time for this amazing adventure.'

The expedition is being sponsored by Calor Gas which also provided a stove and the LPG needed to cook.

Hancock was ferried to the remote Scottish islet during a 12-hour journey aboard a boat from local operator Kilda Cruises. He is leaving his wife Pamela and 18-month-old son, Freddie, for two months to raise £10,000 for Help the Heroes charity.

Hancock plans to spend the time 
learning harmonica and said he hoped to become 'as good as Larry Adler' -
 the late American master, who collaborated with Elton John and Sting - 
when he leaves Rockall.

'At least I won't drive anybody else crazy with my playing,' he said.

Mr Hancock want to set both the longest solo occupation of Rockall and the longest occupation in its history.

'I will be surviving off less than 2500 calories a day and consuming military-style boil-in-the-bag rations.

'I am looking forward to it and I am not nervous. I have done all the preparations I can.'

In 2011 TV adventurer Ben Fogle said he wanted to lead an exhibition to 'reclaim' Rockall for Britain.

'I once tried to invade Rockall, unsuccessfully, and have first-hand experience of the ridiculousness of Rockall's size and the recklessness of attempting a landing. It is a realm of the sea, a kingdom governed only by the weather,' he said.

'Nick's attempt to not only land, but stay for 60 days and raise money for a very worthy charity is an apt gesture for an island so immersed in eccentricity.'

Survival expert Bear Grylls added that it was 'an ambitious, exciting - and wonderfully mad - project, but in aid of a life-changing charity that needs our help.'

Belgian radio enthusiasts landed on the remote North Atlantic islet - Britain's loneliest outpost - in October 2011 and transmitted for more than 15 hours.

The island is the core of an eroded volcano that erupted around 55 million years ago.

The rock is 100ft wide and 70ft high and in the past Ireland, Iceland and Denmark have lain claim to Rockall and to the possible oil and gas reserves surrounding it.

Even TV adventurer Ben Fogle failed to land Rockall and he has praised Mr Hancock for the attempt

Ownership is now being examined by the United Nations in the light of competing claims from Iceland, the Faroes and Ireland.

The earliest recorded landing on Rockall was believed to be in 1810, by an officer called Basil Hall from the HMS Endymion.

In 2011 an adventurer dramatically cancelled his attempt to land on Rockall to reaffirm the UK's ownership of it - after half his team suddenly quit two days into the expedition.

Andy Strangeway wanted to put a new plaque on Rockall to replace the one that was left in 1955 in what was the last territorial expansion of the British Empire.

Yorkshireman Mr Strangeway also had to cancel a bid in 2010 to reach Rockall after there was a hold-up in getting the islet's first planning permission from the Western Isles Council - the nearest local authority.

The Royal Navy annexed Rockall in 1955 and the Island Of Rockall Act 1972 declared it part of the Western Isles.

Its exact position was first charted by Royal Navy surveyor Captain ATE Vidal in 1831.

But it was on September 18, 1955, that the island was officially annexed by the British Crown when three marines - Lieutenant-Commander Desmond Scott, Sergeant Brian Peel and Corporal AA Fraser - and civilian naturalist James Fisher were deposited on the island by a Royal Navy helicopter.

The team cemented in a brass plaque on Hall's Ledge and hoisted the Union Flag to stake the UK's claim.

During his reconnaissance trip last June, Mr Hancock did unfurl a Union Jack and tweeted on Twitter: 'Happy jubilee Your Majesty' but did, however, lose some equipment during his brief stay.

The occupiable area of Rockall, named in 1955 as Hall's Ledge after the first recorded person to land there, is just 11 feet x 4 feet, and is just 13 feet below the summit.

There are no trees or bushes on the rock - just algae, seaweeds and one black lichen. Just over 20 species of sea bird and only six species of animal have been recorded on or near Rockall.
