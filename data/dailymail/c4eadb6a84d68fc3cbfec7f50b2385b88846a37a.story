A teenager's first drive alone can be tough for any parent. 

The crash rate per mile driven for 16- to 19-year-olds is nearly three times the rate for drivers aged 20 and over.

Now, Chevrolet has come up with a solution that will allow parents to spy on their children's driving remotely, as well as prevent them from speeding.

the 2016 Chevrolet Malibu will debut a system, called Teen Driver, that provides parents with a tool to help encourage safe driving habits for their teeangers

- Distance driven

- Maximum speed travelled

- Over-speed warnings issued

- Stability control events

- Antilock brake events

- Forward Collision Alerts, if equipped

- Forward Collision Braking events, if equipped

Dubbed 'Teen Driver', the system will be included on the 2016 Chevrolet Malibu.

Features include automatic muting the radio or paired devices when seatbelts are unfastened.

It also gives audible and visual warnings when the vehicle is traveling faster than a speed set by parents.

'We developed this system so parents could use it as a teaching tool with their kids – they can discuss and reinforce safe driving habits,' said General Motors safety engineer MaryAnn Beebe.

'As a mother of two, I know anything that has the potential of keeping one's family safer is of great value to parents.'

Parents can view maximum speed reached, distance driven and number of times active safety features were used. 

To use Teen Driver, a parent needs to enable the feature by creating a PIN in the Settings menu of their available MyLink system, which then allows them to register their teen's key fob.

The feature can mute the audio of the radio or any device paired with the vehicle when front seat occupants aren’t wearing their safety belts, and it gives audible and visual warnings when the vehicle is traveling over preset speeds

When active, the radio system's maximum volume can also be set to a lower level.

If the vehicle is equipped with active safety features like Forward Collision Alert, they are automatically turned on.

Parents can also manually turn those safety features off when Teen Driver is used.

This means that things like traction control and blind zone warning are  disabled so that new drivers learn good habits rather than relying on technology.
