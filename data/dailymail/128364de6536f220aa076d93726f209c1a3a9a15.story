The Coalition is facing a serious crisis of public confidence as five out of six voters now believe it will not survive until the 2015 General Election.

And the number who think the Government will collapse early has doubled in a fortnight as the Lib Dems and Tories continue to squabble in public, a new poll has revealed.

It is more bad news for David Cameron and Nick Clegg, who have fallen out over reforming the House of Lords and constituency boundary changes.

Confidence crisis: Only one in six voters now believe the Coalition will survive to May 2015 because David Cameron and Nick Clegg continue to squabble

The two leaders are continuing to stick together on the economy, but if they were to row over that then it could spell the end for the partnership.

According to a Guardian/ICM poll only 16 per cent said the Coalition will survive to May 2015.

This has halved from the 33 per cent who thought this when asked the same question two weeks ago.

Meanwhile the number who think it will last to a few months before the 2015 election has also dropped from 23 per cent a fortnight ago to 19 per cent.

And 43 per cent think it will implode in the next two years - double the 23 per cent who though this in late July.

One in ten think the Lib Dem/Tory pact will break up even quicker.

The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister met for a 'clear the air' dinner on Friday to patch up the Coalition feud over reform of the House of Lords and parliamentary boundary changes.

It is understood the two agreed to stop squabbling and focus on the economy instead before they both go on holiday today, leaving Foreign Secretary  William Hague to run the country.

The dinner in the Prime Minister’s flat was attended by the four senior members of the Coalition – the  so-called ‘Quad’ of Mr Cameron, Chancellor George Osborne, Mr Clegg and Liberal Democrat Treasury Minister Danny Alexander.

It came after mounting fears that the Coalition is on the verge of collapse.

Mr Clegg last week retaliated against Mr Cameron’s failure to back him over House of Lords reform by publicly vowing to sabotage the Prime Minister’s plan to approve changes in parliamentary constituencies, which would boost Conservative hopes of winning the next Election.

In an interview with The Mail on Sunday, Mr Cameron said Mr Clegg was wrong to oppose moves to reduce the number of MPs and address the growing imbalance in the number of voters in each constituency.

The Prime Minister said that the  Lib Dems had broken their pledge to allow boundary changes in exchange for last year’s referendum on scrapping Britain’s first-past-the-post General Election voting system – which was defeated.

Mr Cameron said he had invited Mr Clegg to dinner to put the recent disputes behind them and ‘hammer out what we will be doing this autumn and into the future’.

Mr Cameron said: ‘I wouldn’t be giving up my Friday night to sit down with the Lib Dems if I didn’t want a bold reforming long-term government.

'Yes, there are arguments, but there are arguments in one-party governments too.’

Two polls published in other newspapers suggested the Olympics had done little to shift opinion on who to vote for.

YouGov, for the Sunday Times, put Labour on 42%, the Conservatives on 34% and the Lib Dems and Ukip on 8% each.
