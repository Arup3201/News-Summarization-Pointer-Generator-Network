Sea lions love to sunbathe and sleep, and apparently aren't too fussed about privacy.

Fortunately so, for this pier in California appears to be the place for doing both, regardless of how many other sea lions have the same idea.

Piled on top of each other, sometimes three or four mammals high, you might expect there to be some arguments.

Move up! A snug harem of sea lions loll around on top of each other on a crowded pier in California

But, according to photographer Michael Yang, the lazy sea lions seemed not bothered in the slightest about being crushed and walked over.

Animals of all shapes and sizes were piled onto the pier at Moss Landing, in Monterey Bay, California.

The snug scene was captured this week on sunny day when the pod of sea lions had 'taken over' the pier, 'trying to keep themselves dry and warm'.

Tolerant: Remarkably, the large, smelly animals seemed quite happy in such close proximity to each other; those under several others didn't appear to mind

Photographer Michael Yang said male sea lions average over 600 pounds in weight while female sea lions are just over 200 pounds

Sea lion soup: 'Other than keeping clear of the pier, staying upwind of these massive creatures is also a good idea,' said Mr Yang

'There are so many of them on the pier that, in some places, they are sleeping on top of each other,' he said.

The photographer said male sea lions weigh an average of over 600 pounds, while female sea lions are just over 200 pounds.

'They must have a really thick layer of blubber cushioning them; the sea lions on the bottom didn't seem to be bothered by the fact that there were several other sea lions sleeping on top of it.'

Mr Yang speculates: 'They must have a really thick layer of blubber cushioning them; the sea lions on the bottom didn't seem to be bothered by the fact that there were several other sea lions sleeping on top of it.'

People are advised to keep away from the pier in Moss Landing, California, which becomes a home for the sea lions every year

He said aside from making an impressive photo, he advised steering clear of the pier, especially being down-wind of the animals.

'With just a small change of the wind, you can catch a strong scent of rotten fish emanating from them,'Â  he said.

He added: 'I've been going to Moss Landing to photograph for several years now and the sea lions are always on the pier, sleeping and basking in the sun.

'In fact, there is a sign posted on the pier that reads: "Danger. Attention Kayakers. Stay Clear of Dock".'

Stay clear: Kayakers are warned to keep away from the sea lions which weigh more than twice the average weight of a person

Fishing boats moored alongside the pier must board their boats with acre so as not to disrupt the lazy harem of sea lions
