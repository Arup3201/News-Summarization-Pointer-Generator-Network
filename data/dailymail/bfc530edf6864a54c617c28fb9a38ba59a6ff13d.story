Historic cobblestones in a picturesque market town have been ruined after council workers made a clumsy attempt to paint double yellow lines over them.

Residents in Stamford, Lincolnshire - dubbed 'England's most attractive town' by poet John Betjeman - were furious when they saw the Georgian cobbles daubed in thick, yellow paint.

The paint has run amongst the stones, which were laid in the Georgian era, leaving an unsightly mess in St Mary's Place in the town, a popular tourist destination.

What a mess: Bungling council workers have enraged residents in the picturesque market town of Stamford, Lincolnshire, after wrecking historic cobblestones by covering them with thick yellow paint

James Tweedle, 33, who lives nearby, said: 'It's absolute incompetence from the council.

'Surely if you get professionals in they should realise that liquid will run around obstacles like cobbles?

'Now our taxpayers' money will have to be forked out again just to re-do something that should have been done right first time.'

Liz Heesom, 20, who lives in the road, said: 'This beautiful medieval church precinct has been spoiled by the careless and unsightly ladling out of thick yellow paint.'

Lincolnshire County Council's area highways manager Kevin Brumfield said the lines would be repainted before Christmas.

He said: 'We are currently refreshing the lines for when parking enforcement starts on December 3 so that the parking restrictions are clear to motorists.

'It is always harder to put material on road surfaces like this but our contractor is going back to see if the appearance can be improved.'

Dating back more than 1,000 years, Stamford prospered as a wool town under the Normans.

By the 13th century, it was one of the 10 largest towns in England with a castle and 14 churches.

As the wool trade moved away, the town declined, but local man William Cecil restored its fortunes.

When Cecil became secretary of state to Queen Elizabeth, he built Burghley House for his mother just outside Stamford.

Improvements to the Great North Road in the 17th century helped trade as everyone who travelled north passed through the town.

Prosperous local merchants built grand houses which now help the town's tourist and film trade.

The BBC filmed George Eliot's Middlemarch in the town, which was also the setting for scenes in Another Country, starring Rupert Everett and Colin Firth.

Stamford's George Hotel was an important coaching inn in the 17th and 18th centuries and still enjoys huge popularity with visitors today.Â 

Noted guests have included King Charles I, William III, and Sir Walter Scott.
