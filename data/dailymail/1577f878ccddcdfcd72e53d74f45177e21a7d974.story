A popular female scientist has launched an attack on the sexist commenters that respond to her YouTube video blogs on a daily basis.

Emily Graslie, 23, who is Chief Curiosity Correspondent at Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History, regularly receives negative feedback concerning the fact that she is a woman on her show Brain Scoop.

In a blisteringly articulate post titled 'Where My Ladies At', she argues that this kind of 'internet bullying' is hampering the advance of female educators in science, technology, engineering and math.

Stop the internet bullying: Emily Graslie, 23, who is Chief Curiosity Correspondent at Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History, regularly receives sexist comments about her YouTube show Brain Scoop

'There's a pressure to be the whole
 package,' she says. 'Not only do you have to be intelligent and articulate, but you
 also have to be attractive.'

Among the comments that she cites as examples are statements like: 'I'd still totally do her,' and 'perhaps you should consider wearing slightly racier 
clothing?'

Indeed, many are personal attacks on her appearance.

'I 
can't stop looking at her nose. It looks so weird. It kind of makes her 
look like a nerdy pig'

'She just needs some sexier glasses,' reads one. 'I 
can't stop looking at her nose. it looks so weird. It kind of makes her 
look like a nerdy pig.'

Another observes: 'She is really cute, but as if she made 
herself unattractive on purpose? She could easily keep us focused by 
changing her clothes. I would really like to see her again with the 
new looks.'

Others take aim at the fact that she is a woman in science, assuming that the brains behind the operation are male.

Calling for change: Ms Graslie said that there is widespread apathy when it comes to such comments, largely because people don't know what to do about them

'You'd think this was a man's job, not two
 beautiful ladies,' one said. 'Thumbs up for the Skyrim reference. it made me 
chortle. I assume that was written by Michael.' [Michael: 'That was not written by me.']

Ms Graslie points out that 'the overwhelming
 majority of comments are positive and encouraging, but there's still a
 lot of nastiness that I have to deal with on a daily basis in trying to
 make these positive and encouraging videos.'

She explains that there are significantly
 less female STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) bloggers 
than men, and they are experiencing far less success.

'While there are at least 13 STEM channels hosted by men with more than 400,000 subscribers, and seven of 
those 13 that have topped a million, there are only four channels hosted by
 women that have more than 160,000. None of us have more than a million,' she said.

She adds that while this is not a numbers game, and that the male bloggers deserve their success, this sexist reaction could be part of the reason that women don't persevere when faced with it.

'I feel like in general women don't have enough time to do 
these things because of the pressure that every episode has to be 
flawless in execution,' she said. 'This could be a deterrent for both men and women,
 but I feel women are going to give up more easily.'

She says women in her field have a fear of the feedback from subscribers and commenters because one becomes concerned that the audience 
is more focused on their appearance than the quality of content.

'Even
 more than that, we are not convinced that the content has to be good or
 factual because we're not convinced that people are watching for the 
content in the first place,' she continues. 'That brings on self criticism like, I'm not intelligent or funny or engaging enough on my own.'

Ms Graslie said that there is widespread apathy when it comes to such comments, largely because people don't know what to do about them.

She called upon viewers to help spark a change and acknowledge that these are serious issues that need to be discussed.

'We can't 
idly sit by and tolerate internet bullying in any form,' she said. 'Because that's 
what this is - this is internet bullying. . . Help us make it widely-known that this 
kind of apathetic attitude is detrimental and unacceptable.

'We need to 
make sure that we're making it possible for people of all genders to 
feel acknowledged for their contributions and not feel held back by 
something as arbitrary as their genetics or their appearance.'
