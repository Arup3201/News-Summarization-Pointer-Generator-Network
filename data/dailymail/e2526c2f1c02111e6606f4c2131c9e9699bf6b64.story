Tottenham has confirmed Paul Mitchell's move from Southampton to become the north London club's head of recruitment and analysis.

Mitchell is hailed as a driving force in the successful scouting and hiring structure that has seen the Saints turn a troubled summer into a remarkable success with their improved squad coming at a profit of £37million.

'We are delighted to announce that Paul Mitchell has joined the Club as Head of Recruitment and Analysis,' Spurs announced on their website before outlining his background. 

Tottenham sold Gareth Bale to La Liga giants Real Madrid for £86million in 2013

Paul Mitchell's task is to overhaul Tottenham's scouting system and have the success he did at Southampton

Tottenham technical director Franco Baldini could be heading for the White Hart Lane exit door 

Roberto Soldado Spanish, 29, F, £26.4m

Verdict: Underwhelming. Six goals and six assists in 33 Premier League games is a costly return.

Erik Lamela Argentinian, 22, AM, £25.7m

Verdict: Nearly-man. Lavish talent but no goals in 20 PL games.

Paulinho Brazilian, 26, M, £17.4m 

Verdict: Miss. Far from the best midfielder in north London, let alone Brazil.

Etienne Capoue French, 26, M, £9.7m

Verdict: Jury out. Patchy form and injuries have disrupted his season.

Christian Eriksen Danish, 22, M, £11.5m

Verdict: Mercurial. Brilliant last season, less so this. 10 PL goals, eight assists.

Ben Davies Welsh, 21, D, £10m 

Verdict: Miss. One PL game is a poor return.

Vlad Chiriches Romanian, 25, D, £8.5m

Verdict: Middling at best. Solid early but unreliable.

Federico Fazio Argentinian, 27, D £8m

Verdict: Miss. Error-prone, two red cards already.

Nacer Chadli Belgian, 25, AM, £7.2m 

Verdict: Hit. Best value of all, PL goals (seven) and assists (four).

Eric Dier English, 20, D, £4m 

Verdict: Promising. Early goals (two in PL) and shows potential.

Ben Stambouli, French, 24, M, £4.7m

Verdict: Miss. Just one sub PL appearance.

DeAndre Yedlin (US, 21, £2.5m) & Michel Vorm (Dutch, 31, £5m) Yedlin on loan. Vorm yet to play in PL.

'A former player with Wigan Athletic and MK Dons, Paul initially took up the role of community ambassador with the Dons when he retired from playing in 2009 at the age of 27.

'Following the appointment of Karl Robinson as manager in 2010, Paul was assigned to his back room staff as Head of Recruitment, recognising his aptitude for identifying player talent.

'He joined Southampton in January, 2012 to manage their Scouting and Recruitment department.'

Southampton farewelled some of their biggest players, including Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw and Rickie Lambert, along with coach Mauricio Pochettino to Spurs in the off-season.

But they've rebuilt under Ronald Koeman and sit a lofty second on the Premier League ladder. 

The appointment could mean the end of Spurs’s technical director Franco Baldini's tenure at the club

Baldini, 54, has been in his job since summer last year and oversaw player departures including Spurs’ best player and talisman Gareth Bale for a world record £86m.

Results have been mixed for the 13 faces brought in partly with the cash raised, from Paulinho to Roberto Soldado to Erik Lamela and, more recently, Federico Fazio and Ben Stambouli.

‘Franco is pretty relaxed about the situation but he knows in football that people come and go and that he’ll be moving on at some point, whenever that is,’ said a source.

Mitchell, 33, follows Pochettino from St Mary's to White Hart Lane where Saints players including Jay Rodriguez and Morgan Schneiderlin are highly coveted.

Pochettino is the fifth permanent manager in seven years since Juande Ramos joined in 2007 and the Argentine has been left a squad that isn't able to flourish under his high-tempo pressing system that so impressed in the south. 

Spurs had lost three of their four league games leading up to Sunday's unconvincing three points over Hull that required a 90th minute winner from Christian Eriksen. 

Paulinho and Roberto Soldado are among the players who have failed to impress since joining the club

Tottenham's Harry Kane has said his team-mates need time to adapt to Mauricio Pochettino's style 

Pochettino's Spurs climbed from 12th to 10th with a last-ditch win over Hull on Sunday

Tottenham fan Martin Cloake, who wrote the book Taking Our Ball Back, says the staff merri-go-round at White Hart Lane is hurting the club.

‘It’s clear that there has been too much change in personnel recently,’ he says of Spurs’ dilemma. ‘There’s not much sense of team spirit evident when we play and no real leaders stand out.

‘There are lots of players with potential flair, perhaps fewer of the type who will dig in and help to hold a team together — therefore letting the flair players express themselves.

‘Off the pitch, the phrase ‘I’ve never felt so disconnected from the club I support’ keeps coming up. That’s partly because of the discontent with the top level of football in this country but it’s also because those running the club too often come across as aloof and as treating the fans as cash cows.'
