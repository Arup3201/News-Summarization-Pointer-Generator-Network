Church camp: The occupation could cost around £1million in lost tourist revenue after St Paul's closed its doors on Friday

The anti-capitalist protest forcing St Paul’s Cathedral to close is a ‘big charade’ with only one in ten tents occupied overnight, the Daily Mail can reveal.

Footage from a thermal imaging camera shot by a police helicopter revealed that the ramshackle camp is almost completely empty during the cold nights.

It suggests the majority of the 300 ‘defiant’ protesters at the cathedral return home or to hotels after dark to sleep in warm beds.

Corporation of London councillor  
Matthew Richardson said: ‘It’s incredible. The overnight monitoring of 
the site by the police showed that 90 per cent of the tents are 
unoccupied.

'It just shows most of the demonstrators don’t have the courage of their convictions and are just here to make trouble.

‘Leaving your tent here overnight is a good way to do it. It’s a phantom camp – a big charade.’ 

St
 Paul’s shut for the first time since World War Two last week after the 
site doubled in size in a week and the demonstrators refused to move.

The
 protesters discussed the number of empty tents in the camp at a meeting
 on Sunday and made plans to organise a system to allocate them to any 
newcomers.

Giant signs 
hang over the encampment denouncing capitalism, but many of the 
activists spent much of yesterday sitting in a Starbucks overlooking the
 churchyard, several working on laptops.

However, most activists maintain a front
 of selfless commitment to their cause, with a sign attached to one tent
 proclaiming: ‘All day, all week, we’ll sleep on London’s freezing 
streets. Solidarity!’

An activist at the centre of the 
Dale Farm demonstration and Occupy London’s protest camp is the son of a
 property developer it emerged last night.

But 21-year-old Jack Hartcup says he does not want to benefit from his father’s success.

Mr Hartcup, who is studying a philosophy degree at Anglia Ruskin University, insisted:

‘I’m an anarchist and I don’t believe in leadership.

‘I’m not set to inherit this fortune. I don’t believe in property.

‘My father has done very well for himself but I don’t intend to do what he does. He has gone along with the capitalist system.’

His
 54-year-old father, James, is the director of Eclipse Building Ltd, 
which owns the Eclipse building – a £10million development in North 
London.

Until 2008 Mr 
Hartcup was registered as living with his father in one of the 14 luxury
 flats, which sell for more than £1.5million and cost up to £1,500 per 
week to rent.

The protest is one of several in 
Europe, inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York, 
intended to highlight inequalities caused by mismanagement of the 
economy.

The 
revelation about the part-time protesters came as it emerged that any 
legal move to evict the camp would be likely to drag on for months.

But St Paul’s is facing increasing pressure to take legal action to try to remove the protesters.

Mr Richardson said: ‘The church has to make a decision and the sooner the better.

‘It is frustrating, but they are just muddling through the best they can.

‘If this church stays closed there’s going to be tremendous trouble.

‘It
 could stay closed for Remembrance day, and even Christmas.’ Mark Field,
 Conservative MP for Cities of London and Westminster, said: ‘St Paul’s 
is a Unesco World Heritage site and they have turned it into a Third 
World shanty town.

‘There’s masses of space in front of the entrance and yet the doors are shut. I’d love to have an explanation for that.’

A City of London Police spokesman said: ‘We continue to use a range of techniques to facilitate peaceful protests.’

He
 added: ‘We are constantly assessing the site and continue to provide 
low-key policing that facilitates peaceful protest while minimising 
disruption to the local people.’

Thermal imaging suggests protesters return home or to hotels overnight

In common with other newspapers a Mail article in October said that police thermal images showed nine out of ten tents in the Occupy London protest camp were empty at night. We are happy to clarify that this information – backed up by subsequent thermal images taken by the Daily Mail – was based on comments by Councillor Matthew Richardson and an informed police source.
