The two lost kittens who shut down a portion of the New York City subway system Thursday after wandering onto the tracks should count their lucky stars that Joe Lhota is not the mayor yet.

The former chairman of the Metropolitan Transit Authority and mayoral hopeful said he wouldn’t have stopped the subway as the kittens dubbed Arthur and August scrambled along the tracks.

A spokesman for Lhota told the New York Post on Friday that the candidate doesn’t think stopping service for wayward cats is appropriate.

He said Lhota believes it should be the MTA’s call whether to shut down the line.

On Thursday, power was cut on B and Q lines in Brooklyn for more than an hour as the two lost kitties scurried around the tracks.

The tiny felines were finally rescued about seven hours later. Officials said Arthur and August, are being treated in a shelter.

Lhota’s rivals in the mayoral race, among them Anthony Weiner, told the paper they would’ve stopped trains to save the pets.

In fact, a spokesperson for the disgraced former congressman went even further, saying that the candidate would have risked his own life to rescue the helpless critters.

'If Anthony is elected mayor, he will not only stop trains for kittens, he will personally crawl over the third rail to do it,' Barbara Morgan told the Post.

Campaigning outside a subway stop Friday, Mr Weiner jokingly told the New York Daily News that if elected mayor, he would put in place a comprehensive subway kitten rescue policy.

Other candidates also stated their position on the issue of whether or not to stop the trains for the kitties. Christine Quinn came out on the side of the furry felines, as did Bill Thompson's campaign.

The aptly named John Catsimatidis deferred to the MTA or police, but noted that he is an animal lover who once owned a beloved feline named Cottonball.

For former City Councilman Sal Albanese, it was a no-brainer.

‘What are we, nuts? Of course I would’ve stopped,’ he said. ‘This almost never happens, but when it does, we can’t just go running over kittens.’

While the mayoral hopefuls were opining on the fate of the kittens, August and Arthur were recuperating at an Animal Care & Control shelter in the East New York section of Brooklyn.

Sources told the Post that the 8-week-old pets have been kept together as they are undergoing physical and behavioral tests.

August and Arthur, each weighing around 2lbs, will be vaccinated and then transferred to a foster home. Within a couple of weeks, they will be available for adoption.

When the two tiny felines were spotted frolicking on the train tracks near the Church Avenue station in Brooklyn about 11am, Metropolitan Transportation Authority workers turned off the power.

Passengers on the B and Q lines were stranded for about two hours while police officers chased the cats down the tracks.

According to the Wall Street Journal,
a spokeswoman said police officers went onto the tracks to roust the 
cats so they wouldn't be at risk. She also said the MTA did not wish to 
accidentally 'fry' the kittens.

Crews suspended regular service from 
DeKalb Avenue to Brighton Beach and Stillwell just after 11am and provided shuttle buses, according to NY Daily News.

Service was restored once the kitties scurried off the tracks. However it's not clear what happened to the tiny cats.

The Journal also speculated the MTA's reaction was so extravagant after it was forced to explain why a dead shark was found on an N train at Queens Plaza earlier this month.
