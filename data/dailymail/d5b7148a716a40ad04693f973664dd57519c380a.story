Destructive: Researchers have found the two cyber weapons are connected

U.S.companies frustrated by their inability to stop sophisticated 
hacking attacks are taking retaliatory action, sometimes outside the 
law, experts say.

Known in the cybersecurity industry as 'active defense' or 'strike-back'
technology, the reprisals range from modest steps to distract and delay
a hacker to more controversial measures.

Security experts say they even know of some cases where companies have 
taken action that could violate laws in the U.S. or other countries, 
such as hiring contractors to hack the assailant's own systems.

In the past, companies that have been attacked have mostly focused on 
repairing the damage to their computer networks and shoring them up to 
prevent future breaches.

But with malicious software widely available on the Internet for anyone 
wanting to cause trouble, prevention is increasingly difficult and 
companies are growing more aggressive.

'Not only do we put out the fire, but we also look for the arsonist,' 
said Shawn Henry, a former head of cybercrime investigations at the FBI.
In April he joined new cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, which aims to
provide clients with a menu of active responses.

Once a company detects a network breach, rather than expel the intruder 
immediately, it can waste the hacker's time and resources by appearing 
to grant access to tempting material that proves impossible to extract.

Companies can also allow intruders to make off with bogus files or 
'beacons' that reveal information about the thieves' own machines, 
experts say.

Mr Henry and CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovich do not recommend 
that companies try to breach their opponent's computers, but they say 
the private sector does need to fight back more boldly against cyber 
espionage.

It is commonplace for law firms to have their emails hacked and read 
during negotiations for ventures in China, Mr Alperovich told the 
Reuters Global Media and Technology Summit.

That has given the other side tremendous leverage because they know the 
Western client company's strategy, including the most they would be 
willing to pay for a certain stake.

But if a company knows its lawyers will be hacked, it can plant false 
information and get the upper hand. 'Deception plays an enormous role,' 
Mr Alperovich said.

Flame: The sophisticated virus has been used to spy on computer systems

Other security experts say a more aggressive posture is unlikely to have
a significant impact in the near term in the overall fight against 
cybercriminals and Internet espionage.

Veteran government and private officials warn that much of the activity 
is too risky to make sense, citing the chances for escalation and 
collateral damage.

'There is no business case for it and no possible positive outcome,' 
said John Pescatore, a National Security Agency and Secret Service 
veteran who leads research firm Gartner's Internet security practice.

Nevertheless, the movement shows the deep anger and sense of futility 
among security professionals, many of whom feel that a bad situation is 
getting worse, endangering both their companies and the national 
economy.

'There's nothing you can do' to keep determined and well-financed 
hackers out, said Rodney Joffe, senior technologist at Internet 
infrastructure company Neustar Inc and an advisor to the White House on 
cybersecurity.

Mr Joffe recently looked at 168 of the largest 500 U.S. companies by 
revenue and found evidence in Neustar forensic logs that 162 of them 
owned machines that at some point had been transmitting data out to 
hackers.

Frustration by security professionals is not new. Some privately 
admitted to rooting for Lulz Security last year during that hacking 
group's unprecedented spree of public crimes, when it broke into and 
embarrassed Sony Corp, an FBI affiliate and others with routine hacking 
techniques.

They said the resulting media coverage finally caught the attention of 
CEOs and legislators, although tougher cybersecurity laws have yet to 
pass Congress.

Collaboration: Experts say they have found evidence that the two programmes shared the same source code

Although some strike-backs have occurred quietly in the past, Facebook 
popularised going on offensive, said Jeff Moss, founder of the 
influential Black Hat security conferences and an advisor to the 
Department of Homeland Security.

In January, Facebook Inc named some of the Russian players behind the 
malicious 'Koobface' software that spread through spam on various social
networks, earning the gang an estimated $2million.

The security industry's shortcomings were underscored most recently by 
the discovery of the Flame spying virus in the Middle East.

Mikko Hypponen, the well-regarded chief research officer at Finland's 
F-Secure Oyj, told the Reuters Summit his company had a sample of Flame 
in 2010 and classified it as clean and later missed another virus called
Duqu that was suspected of being backed by Western governments.

'These are examples how we are failing' as an industry, Mr Hypponen said.

'Consumer-grade antivirus you buy from the store does not work too well 
trying to detect stuff created by the nation-states with nation-state 
budgets.'

Because some national governments are suspected in attacks on private 
Western companies, it is natural that some of the victims want to join 
their own governments to fight back.

'It's time to have the debate about what the actions would be for the 
private sector,' former NSA director Kenneth Minihan said at the RSA 
security conference held earlier this year in San Francisco.

In April, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano 
told the San Jose Mercury News that officials had been contemplating 
authorising even 'proactive' private-entity attacks, although there has 
been little follow-up comment.

Many large security providers no longer preach that keeping the enemy 
out is paramount. Instead, they adopt the more recent line taken by the 
Pentagon, which is to assume that hackers have gotten inside and will 
again.

The mainstream advice now is to focus on trying to detect suspicious activity as quickly as possible in order to shut it down.

Hitting back with force is only the most colorful of possible responses 
after that. More common alternatives include deep analysis of what data 
has been sent out and attempts to learn whether the recipients were 
competitors, criminals who might try to resell it, or national 
governments, who might be inclined to share it with local industry.

Some experts also say executives should identify their most prized 
intellectual property and keep it off of networked computers and 
consider evasive action - such as having 100 versions of a critical 
digitised blueprint and only one that is genuine, with the right one 
never identified in emails.

'There is a reason that people fly halfway around the world to have a one-hour meeting,' Mr Joffe said of intelligence agencies.
