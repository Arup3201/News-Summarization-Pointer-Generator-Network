When Nicole Scherzinger stepped out earlier this week in an on-trend black jumpsuit from Missguided, she put the burgeoning brand firmly on the fashion map.

And now FEMAIL brings you the brand new collection from the e-tailer, which also counts Little Mix and the TOWIE girls among its famous fans.

Missguided, whose USP is vibrant catwalk trends at low price points, has unveiled its latest collection, PEACE + LOVE.

Fashion forward: Missguided, a brand loved by celebrities, has unveiled a new collection called PEACE + LOVE

Dress to impress: The slick and stylish new range is mostly under £50 (L) Lizzie dress, £35 (R) Lara dress, £40

The models work an array of mock croc, leatherette and silk-look pieces in slate grey, midnight blue and monochromatic tones.

The limited edition collection consists of 35 key pieces and offers a strong selection of jackets, dresses, shorts and midis, all priced between £20 and £65.

There are plenty of thigh-skimming dresses, crop tops and lace - perfect for a night on the town.

The Manchester-based label was founded in 2009 and now stocks over 3000 pieces.

'Our
design team have revamped the PEACE + LOVE collection this season with a
collection that embodies cleaner cuts and sleek minimalism,' says Nitin Passi, Managing Director at Missguided.

Celebrity fans: Nicole wears Minako one-shoulder jumpsuit, £37.99; while Perrie Edwards of Little Mix wears checked trousers, £18.99, both from Missguided

On-trend: There's a mix of mock croc, leatherette and silk-look pieces in slate grey, midnight navy and monochromatic tones (L) Daria jumpsuit, £40 (R) Natalia dress, £35

'The range uses more premium fabrics than our main line, however price points remain competitive, as this is key to our whole offer.'

Fashion blogger Lydia Faye Jones said: 'Missguided has always been my go-to brand for stylish pieces at affordable prices.

'Their new collection is right on trend with muted monochrome tones and luxe leather - can't wait to get my hands on these!'

Black out: Perfect for a night on the town, there are lots of sheer crop tops and fitted leather skirts for the fashion-forward (Mira skirt, £30)

Hell for leather: Staying true to seasonal trends, there's plenty of leather in the PEACE + LOVE collection (Tali trousers, £45)
