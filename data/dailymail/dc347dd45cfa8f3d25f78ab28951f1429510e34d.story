A man who whistled at Australian federal parliament Speaker Bronwyn Bishop because 'he wanted to be heard' in Question Time has been booted out of Parliament House.

The man, who was in the public gallery wearing army fatigues, had to be physically escorted from the viewing area of parliament's lower house, after he'd whistled to catch Bronwyn Bishop's attention.

He also earlier interrupted Treasurer Joe Hockey, who was answering an question from the Labor Opposition on the planned Medicare co-payment.

Come with us. The man who interrupted Question Time at Parliament House is removed by security staff. He interrupted Treasurer Joe Hockey during his speech on the planned Medicare co-payment before whistling at speaker Bronwyn Bishop

He whistled at Ms Bishop, who is the Speaker of the House of Representatives, before telling her he wanted to be heard on an issue of concern to him.

When confronted by security officers, the middle-aged man sat down and refused to leave.

It took three officers to escort him from the chamber. 

The man, who gave his name as John Stayte from Queensland, was frog-marched out of the public gallery

He tells police that he informed Speaker Bronwyn Bishop that he intended to disrupt proceedings

The man, who gave his name as John Stayte from Queensland, was later questioned by Australian Federal Police outside Parliament House.

He claims he will be filing a police complaint against MPs he believed were 'abusing' their power.

'These people are acting beyond their legal authority,' he said

'It's bulls***.'

Asked why he disturbed parliamentary proceedings, the man said he had alerted the Speaker about his intention to do so beforehand and just wanted to be heard.
