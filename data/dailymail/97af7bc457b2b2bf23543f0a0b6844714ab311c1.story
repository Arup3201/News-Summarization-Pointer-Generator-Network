Lara Bingle has reportedly given birth to her first child with actor Sam Worthington.

According to Woman's Day magazine, the model welcomed a baby boy at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles.

The 27-year-old's publicist declined to comment on the report when contacted by Daily Mail Australia.

There is no word yet on what the celebrity couple have called the bub.

Lara has recently been seen spending time with Sam in California ahead of the big day, her blossoming baby bump on show. 

The reports come after the polarising beauty all but confirmed her marriage to Worthington via her blog website, The Base By Lara Bingle on Tuesday.

Writing about a new range of makeup brushes she was road-testing, she wrote: 'My husband is extremely happy because the bathroom now has the beginnings of order!'

Her pregnancy was heavily speculated for months, beginning in October when she was spotted shopping for baby clothes in West Hollywood.

Around the same time, the former reality TV starlet aroused more suspicion while promoting skincare line The Base - as she would make her public appearances wearing outfits that kept her tummy covered.

Lara's pregnancy was confirmed in late January when the beach babe showed off her baby bump for the first time in a white T-shirt while holidaying in Palm Springs.

Meanwhile, rumours have separately been swirling of a marriage between the beautiful blonde and Avatar star Sam.

The speculation was directly sparked by the entrepreneur, who in late December changed her Instagram name to Lara Bingle Worthington.

She rang in the New Year at the gorgeous Maldive Islands, leading to ideas that the vacation served as the couple's honeymoon, and throughout the month visited Istanbul, Budapest and Switzerland. 

In November she foreshadowed her cryptic social media activities, opening up on her thoughts of Twitter and Instagram to Marie Claire and explaining: 

'I think there's no mystery anymore. Everyone knows everything...sometimes it's nice to not know things.'

Everything appeared to be business as usual for Lara on Sunday, who posted a pretty shot of a beach in Los Angeles to her Instagram account.

She and Sam have been dating since 2013, and early last year she relocated from Sydney to New York with the Hollywood action star.

Welcoming his first child comes at a big time for Sam, who will be reprising his role as Jake Sully for the upcoming sequels to Avatar, the highest grossing film of all time, in the coming years.
