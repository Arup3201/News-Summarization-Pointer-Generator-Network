Beaming with excitement, this is the moment Sophie Thomlinson was able to ride a bicycle for the first time thanks to generous donations from Daily Mail readers.

The two-year-old, who has a form of cerebral palsy after being born prematurely, will use the specially-adapted bicycle to strengthen her legs ahead of surgery to enable her to walk.

Readers gave more than £55,000 to help the two-year-old earlier this year after the Mail reported she had been denied NHS funding for the operation - by the same hospital trust which paid for breast enlargement surgery for an aspiring glamour model.

Sophie’s spastic diplegia means she cannot stand and instead shuffles around on her knees. She is only able to take a few steps with the aid of a frame and cannot play outside with her friends.

Her family, from Dukinfield, Greater Manchester, bought the £1,200 bicycle using some of the donations after her physiotherapist recommended it to prepare her for surgery.

Sophie’s mother, former nurse Allison, 40, said it was ‘life changing’.

She said: ‘Just using it means Sophie’s doing things and seeing things she’s not seen before because she’s always been strapped up in a wheelchair.

‘It has given her the opportunity to use her legs and so much more independence.

‘She can go out with other children now when they’re playing in the street, instead of having to sit in her chair waving at them.’

Mrs Thomlinson said she and husband Craig, 44, would have had to save ‘for a long time’ to buy the bicycle without the donations.

‘Being able to give Sophie this bit of independence has entirely been down to the generosity of Daily Mail readers,’ she added. ‘They have given her wheels and started her on a journey where hopefully the next step will be walking.’

Sophie’s brother Lewis, 14, said: ‘I’m just glad my sister can go out on her bike with me now. We are going to go to the park together.’

The bicycle is made by Theraplay, a special needs equipment company, and can be adapted as Sophie grows to give her several years of use.

Despite having raised more than £58,000 in total, Sophie’s family faced another blow in May when doctors at Leeds General Infirmary said she wasn’t eligible for surgery as her condition was ‘not severe enough yet’.

They now must find another £17,000 to take her to the US for the selective dorsal rhizotomy operation on her spine which should enable her to walk.

An anonymous donor has already pledged free flights for the family to travel to St Louis Children’s Hospital in Missouri when they get the go-ahead from Dr Tae Park, the American surgeon who pioneered the procedure.

Funds permitting, Sophie could have the operation next year when she is three. With intensive physiotherapy, she could be walking by five.

The Thomlinsons are raising money through the charity Tree of Hope and any excess will go towards helping other disabled children.

Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs.

The lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system.

These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body.

Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves.

This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut.

Due to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic.

Many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs.
