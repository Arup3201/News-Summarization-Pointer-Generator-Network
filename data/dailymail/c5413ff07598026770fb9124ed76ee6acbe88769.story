This is the dramatic moment an osprey dives through the air with its folded its wings tightly behind its back, before crashing into the water to catch its lunch.

Known as the fighter jet of the animal kingdom, the streamlined bird was photographed as it plunged into El Dorado Park Lake in Long Beach, California in pursuit of a fish.

Ospreys have a wingspan of nearly two metres and can reach speeds of 80 mph when hunting.

Crash: The osprey, which is also known as a sea hawk, crashes into the water and grabs the fish in its talons

Nicknamed the sea hawk, this ultimate aerodynamic killing machine folds its wings behind itself mid-dive in order to achieve the speed and precision of a dart.

Photographer Viet La, 57, from Ontario in California, took the photographs last month.

He said; 'The bird was going very fast - it had to move quickly to catch the fish...He managed to catch his lunch, then he emerged from the water and sat on a nearby branch to eat it.

'You can tell just how fast it was going by how blurry the background of my photo is,' he added.

Paul Stancliffe of the British Trust for Ornithology said: 'Ospreys are fish specialists, feeding on virtually nothing else.'

'Osprey hunt fish by circling over water. Once a fish is spotted below the surface they dive and plunge feet-first into the water to grab the fish in their talons,' he added.

Ospreys are unusual in that they appear almost all over the world as a single living species with, for example, hardly any genetic difference between one bird in Alaska and another that lives in Kenya.

The Osprey is the second most widely distributed raptor species, after the Peregrine Falcon.

In the British Isles the birds are scarce breeders and live primarily in Scotland, with smaller numbers in England and Wales.

Ospreys became extinct in the British Isles in 1916 after aggressive egg and skin collection in the Victorian era, but were recolonised in Scotland in 1954 and reintroduced to the Lake District in 1996.
