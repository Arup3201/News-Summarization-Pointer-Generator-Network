First Lady Michelle Obama took her new bangs for a second outing today as she and the President rolled up his sleeves to help paint bookshelves at a run-down Washington school to mark a National Day of Service.

Chelsea Clinton helped kick off President Obama's three-day inauguration celebration, urging people, at a summit on the National Mall, to participate in volunteer projects, adding that there's a chain of service that links generations of Americans from all across the country.

Mr and Mrs Obama, and their daughters Malia and Sasha, joined 500 volunteers to spruce up Burrville Elementary School while Vice President Joe Biden, his wife, 
Jill, and others members of his family also gave up their time to
help others.

The 70-year-old spent the morning filling care packages for U.S. troops
serving overseas, veterans and first responders at a Unite America in Service event where he charmed other volunteers, one of whom got a kiss on the hand.

Speaking at the summit, Clinton said she was inspired by the volunteer work of her 
grandmother, Dorothy Rodham, who began as a child volunteer teaching 
migrant workers English and kept up her volunteer efforts for her entire
life.

She said Americans should ask themselves: 'What are you doing for others.'

'In my family, the only wrong answer to that question is nothing,' she told the crowd.

Volunteers are 
organizing service events in all 50 states for the day of service, which
Obama created in 2009 to honor Martin Luther King, Jr.

At
the summit, Michelle Obama said, in a videotaped message, that the volunteers 
were 'showing once again that by giving back, we can lift up our fellow 
citizens and build stronger, healthier communities.'

The
president will be officially sworn in for his second term on Sunday in a
small ceremony at the White House. He'll take the oath of office again 
on Monday, the same day the nation marks King's birthday, before hundreds of thousands of people on the National Mall, 
followed by the traditional parade and formal balls.

Thousands
of workers and volunteers were making final preparations for the 
celebration. Hotels and government buildings along the parade route were
adorned with red, white and blue bunting. White tents, trailers and 
generators lined the Mall.

Yet
there is decidedly less energy surrounding Obama's second inauguration 
than there was in 2009. That history-making event drew 1.8 million 
people for the swearing-in of the nation's first black president.

This time, Obama takes the oath of 
office following a bruising presidential campaign and four years of 
partisan fighting. He's more experienced in the ways of Washington. He 
has the gray hair and lower approval ratings to show for it.

For
at least the inauguration weekend, the fiscal fights and legislative 
wrangling will be put aside in favor of pomp and circumstance.

The
White House did not say in advance that Obama would be helping out at 
the school. In 2009, he helped spruce up a shelter for homeless teens in
one of Washington's poorer neighborhoods then visited wounded soldiers 
at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.

The
White House sees the call to service as a way for Americans across the 
country to honor the memory of Martin Luther King Jr. The day Obama 
publicly takes the oath of office marks King's birthday, and 2013 is the
50th anniversary of the civil rights leader's March on Washington.

Also
Saturday, Michelle Obama and Jill Biden were hosting the Kids' 
Inaugural Concert, an evening event paying special tribute to military 
spouses and children.

The crowds pouring into Washington 
were expected to be far smaller than they were four years ago, and there
will be fewer inaugural balls for the president and first lady to 
attend. Still, Obama's swearing-in at the Capitol is expected to draw up
to 800,000 people, which would make it the largest second.

The
president was still working on his inaugural address heading into the 
weekend. He isn't expected to delve deeply into the policy objectives 
he'll tackle in a second term, but the tone and theme of the speech will
set the stage for the policy fights to come.

Aides said he will make the point that while the nation's political system doesn't require politicians to resolve all of their differences, it does require Washington to act on issues where there is common ground. He will speak about how the nation's core principles can still guide a country that has changed immensely since its founding.

Temperatures were forecast to fall throughout the weekend and be in the 30s on Monday when the crowds gather along the parade route that will take Obama from Capitol Hill to the White House.

Despite scaling back on some of the revelry, the inauguration will be a star-studded affair. Top acts including Beyonce, Katy Perry and Brad Paisley have signed on to perform at the weekend's events.

The inauguration also is bringing thousands of Obama campaign staffers and donors to Washington, with many getting invitations for tours and other events at the White House. On Friday, the president and first lady held two private events for donors who helped finance his 2012 campaign.
