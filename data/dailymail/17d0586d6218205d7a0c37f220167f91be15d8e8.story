A man who lives alongside wolves as one of their pack fears they could all be put down after a council refused planning permission for his new reserve.

Shaun Ellis - known as The Wolfman - lives with the wolves in their enclosure at the sanctuary in Come Martin, Devon.

Shaun, 48, has spent 27 years working with the same creatures - even spending nights sleeping in their enclosure with them.

Officials at North Devon Council originally said no planning permission was required for changes to use to his land.

But following a complaint from a neighbour the council said a retrospective planning application was needed - which has now been declined.

Shaun says the decision could leave the animals homeless and fears with no home they would have to be put down.

He said: 'The wildlife park had to be a bit more commercial and we wanted to go down the educational route. We wanted slightly different things.

Friends: The 47-year-old 'Wolfman', who is believed to have the strongest bond with the wild animals of any human, taught his girlfriend Isla, 30, how to live as one of them

Our mates: After Mr Ellis met Isla at a friend's house they hit it off and married in a Native American wedding

Howling: Mr Ellis taught Isla the ways of the wolf world, and she now has her own pack - two males and a female - at their canine education, conservation and wolf research centre in Coombe Martin, Devon

'The wolves are like family to me and 
to have to put them down would ruin my life. We would never find a home 
for them. We tried before and you just cannot do it.

'We would love to give local people the opportunity to come up, book a day with us and find out what we are doing.

'When you see what they are about I think people will have a completely different outlook.

'We want a damn good reason for them to turn this down. I do not see sense in all the arguments they put forward.'

An application was handed to the council in April but was turned down at the end of October.

The council stated three reasons why the planning application had been turned down.

The first was that the site lies within an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and does not preserve or enhance the natural beauty of the surrounding environment.

Secondly, the council believes the site will cause noise nuisance to surrounding houses.

It also said the volume of traffic entering the site will increase, causing a potential danger.

Kissing: Isla Ellis plays with a wolf at The Wolf Centre in Devon. Her husband Mr Ellis said he has been called a 'madman', 'crazy' and 'a lunatic' by people when telling them about his profession

Playing with wolves: Mr Ellis said only one person valuing his work makes him realise he can make a difference

Dawn Fletcher, who deals with the farm's marketing, said the decision was made by one planning officer.

Shaun says he now has one of two options - to appeal the council's refusal or submit a new planning application.

In the eyes: Despite his apparent ease at being accepted, Mr Ellis was often bitten by his wolf family

Scary teeth: Mr Ellis said some of the most serious injuries they have inflicted on him have been the 'internal ones from head butts and being rammed'
