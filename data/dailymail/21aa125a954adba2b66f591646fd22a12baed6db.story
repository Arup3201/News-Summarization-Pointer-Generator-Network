The language of love does not come easily to 22-year-old graduate Brent Zillwood, a freelance film-maker diagnosed with Tourette’s syndrome six years ago.

Inappropriate outbursts or swearing make it difficult for him to approach women, although in an ironic twist, being in love helps minimise the effects of his condition.

‘Being in love is like a form of medication for my Tourette’s,' he reveals. 'When I’m sleeping next to someone I have no Tourette’s, no insomnia, no nightmares, nothing.'

Tourette's sufferer: Brent Zillwood has struggled to find love because of his outbursts, which are brought on by his syndrome

Brent is one of the unusual singletons battling to find love against the odds on Channel 4 series, The Undateables.

His co-stars include men and women with dwarfism, a man with Asperger's and even a woman with Apert syndrome, a condition that causes the face to distort.

But with 70 per cent of British people saying that they wouldn't even consider dating a person with disabilities in a recent sex survey, Brent and his co-stars are facing an uphill struggle.

Brent's story began at the age of 15 when he woke up one morning and noticed he had a small twitch in his head and neck.

Within three months he was dealing with physical and vocal outbursts and the effect on his life was devastating.

Tourette’s syndrome is a neurological condition that affects the brain and nervous system.

Named after French doctor, Georges Gilles de la Tourette, who first described the syndrome in the 19th century, it is characterised by involuntary noises and movements.

Tics are usually vocal (grunting, coughing and shouting) or physical, with typical movements including jerking the head or jumping up and down.

Most sufferers are first diagnosed during childhood and it is linked to ADHD and obsessive compulsive disorder.

‘Initially my parents had no idea what was going on and assumed that as a teenager going through puberty, it was a phase.

'When I was diagnosed I was determined to try and get on with my life like any other 15-year-old but it was incredibly difficult especially as I was living in a small town at the time and I really stuck out which was very isolating,' admits Brent.

Although he was still dating his childhood sweetheart at the time, the impact of his diagnosis put enormous strain on the relationship.

When they split up five years later, Brent was devastated and the effects on his health were disastrous.

‘I was at university and, unfortunately, the Tourette’s feeds off low points in my life. I was so ill my weight dropped to seven stone.

'Doctors managed to help me with medication and I slowly recovered. I started going out and making friends but the anxiety of going on a first date can bring on the tics and I can start twitching or swearing.

'In the back of my mind, I am always 
worrying that the Tourette’s is going to draw attention to me, and 
therefore to my date, which will make her feel really awkward because 
the whole room will be staring at her.

'Going out with me is like going on a date with a live grenade and hoping that it doesn’t go off. I hate the awkward silences because that is when the Tourette’s really wants to come out.

'I can never tell how my Tourette’s is going to act. I wish I could keep it at home on the days I am going on dates,' says Brent.

He now hopes that his appearance on The Undateables, his second, will help him overcome his dating hang-ups and find that special someone.

But his foray into TV hasn't always proved the impetus he's looking for. In the last series, he met bar worker Lizzie, 19, and hit it off with her during a snowboarding trip.

Sadly, it fizzled out soon after the cameras stopped rolling. 'We dated a few times and really got on well.

'I could relax in her company and that kept my tics at bay. But sadly the initial spark fizzled out but we have remained good friends and still keep in touch.

'Since I appeared on the show people 
recognise me around town and have been friendly and understanding about 
my Tourette’s which has given me a huge confidence boost.

‘I
 have gone out with my mates and while I don’t go up to a girl and tell 
her I have Tourette’s, if we get into conversation I’ve found that 
talking about the condition can actually be an ice-breaker.

Has Brent found love? He was instantly won over by Challis's confidence and playful personality

'But,' he adds, 'I would still like to find love which is why the producers matched me with another date.'

This time, he was matched with Challis, 26, an actress and model and Brent admits : ‘Even the Tourette’s voice in my head was shouting, "Boom, Jackpot!"'

Her confidence and fun instantly won Brent over and she wasn’t fazed by his tics. ‘I shouted out loud during one of our dates and it just passed over her head like it hadn’t happened.

'The second time when it happened I laughed and she just cracked up as well. No matter how crazy or strange the disability that a person may have, they are just normal people and what is most important is being treated like you aren’t different.

Romance: Brent says being in love helps to minimise the symptoms of Tourette's syndrome

‘Simple things like a kiss on the cheek or someone showing concern for me when I’m having a really bad tic can help calm me and it also shows their acceptance of me.'

He and Challis spent their first date on a pedalo which Brent admits was a bit too ‘cheesy’ for either of their tastes but quickly followed it up with a gig at a club in Plymouth to watch The Damerels, a band in which Brent's flatmate Tom plays lead guitar.

‘We found we shared common interests in music, are both creative people and it was fun introducing her to all my friends,’ admits Brent but he refuses to be drawn any further on his future with Challis until viewers watch their story later in the series.

‘I’m only young so marriage and a family are something that is still way in the future for me but finding love, that’s the medicine I need right now. Watch this space.'
