Jessica Ridgeway's family today heard horrifying details of how their 10-year-old daughter had her hair cut off and was strangled, sexually assaulted and dismembered by a teenager.

Austin Sigg, 18, was emotionless as prosecutors pushed for consecutive sentences on all 15 convictions of Jessica's murder - but he broke down in tears after a video celebrating Jessica's life was played to the courtroom.

Since he was 17 when he committed the crime, Sigg is exempt from the death penalty and eligible for parole after 40 years, but the other charges could add up to a life sentence.

A psychologist told the court how Sigg was sexually aroused by dismembering the girl in a bath tub and lied to her about how she would see her mother again.

Emotionless: Sentencing in the trial of Austin Sigg began today. Sigg plead guilty to raping and murdering 10-ear-old Jessica Ridgeway last year and may spend the rest of his life in prison

Jessica's disappearance on her way home from school caused panic among 
parents across Denver, who feared their children were not safe

Expert witness Anna Salter said: 'Thereâ€™s no logical motive for dismemberment other than sexual thrill.'

She
 also told how the teenager had no empathy for Jessica and calmly ate a 
snack as he recounted the horrific details of his crime. He strangled her to death with his bare hands after his first attempt to do so with a zip tie failed.

Sigg acted against the 
advice of his defense team, and plead guilty to killing and dismembering
 the fifth-grader after kidnapping her on her way to school on October 
5, 2012.

According to pre-trial hearings, as 
well as Sigg's own admissions to investigators made after his arrest, 
there were plenty of warning signs indicating that the troubled mortuary
 science student was on a dangerous path.

At
 age 16, Sigg has developed an obsession with hard-core child 
pornography and spent a year watching violent videos depicting kids 
being tortured and raped.

Defense attorney Katherine Spengler told how Sigg's mother often inhaled paint in the late stages of her pregnancy and fell down the stairs once shortly before he was born.

Spengler said Sigg was born with an abnormality in his intestines, and that his birth by vacuum extraction also caused him to have a head deformity. She said he had several surgeries before he turned 6.

Killer: Sigg remained emotionless apart from a short period when he broke down in tears after a video celebrating Jessica's life was played to the court

In
 May 2012, four months before the teen decided to fulfill some of his 
sickening fantasies by kidnapping little Jessica on her way to school, 
Sigg unsuccessfully tried to snatch a female jogger in Ketner Lake.

Jessica was snatched off the street while walking to school, and her 
disappearance panicked thousands of residents in Denver's western 
suburbs.

After Sigg pleaded guilty, the prosecution described how Sigg grabbed Jessica, pulled her 
into his car and tied up her hands and feet.

During her a short statement the girl's mother vowed to forget Sigg's name one she left the court room.

Jessica,
 a fifth-grader who loved purple and performing in a peewee cheerleading
 squad, left home to walk to school in Westminster on October 5, 2012. 
She never made it there.

Hundreds
 of people helped search for her. Jessica's backpack was found two days 
later in Superior, a town about six miles from her home. Days after 
that, human remains later identified as Jessica's were found in a park.

Authorities,
 meanwhile, urged residents to watch for any suspicious changes in 
neighbors' behavior. Officers guarded crosswalks and photographed cars 
in the area.

Horror: Police discovered Jessica's body in a field off of a highway on October 19, 2012. It had been severely dismembered by Sigg, who admitted he killed her

Parents 
escorted their children to and from area schools. Mailboxes and trees 
were encircled by ribbons in Jessica's favorite color, purple.

On October 19, 2012, a resident 
contacted authorities to alert them to Sigg because he reportedly had a 
fascination with death, Westminster police Detective Luis Lopez 
testified at a preliminary hearing. FBI agents took a DNA sample from 
Sigg.

On October 23, Sigg's mother, Mindy Sigg, called 911, saying her son wanted to confess.

Investigators said Sigg told them some of Jessica's remains were hidden in a crawl space in his mother's home, where he lived.

Painful: Jessica Ridgeway's mother Sarah Ridgeway left the courtroom earlier this month as prosecutors described the horrors committed against her daughter by Sigg

Monster: Austin Sigg, 18, had spent a year watching violent child pornography depicting kids being raped and tortured before he kidnapped and butchered 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway last year

They
 said Sigg described how he abducted Jessica as she walked past his car.
 He said he bound her arms and her legs, drove around for a little bit, 
then took her to his house.

There, he told investigators, Sigg 
tried to strangle the girl and then used his hands to kill her. He also 
allegedly told investigators that he dismembered Jessica in a bathtub.

Lopez said Sigg's DNA was found on Jessica's clothing.

Sigg
 dropped out of high school after the 11th grade and later earned a GED.
 Former classmates say he was intelligent but complained about school 
and was bullied for having a high voice.

When
 asked about his criminal record on the 911 call, Sigg told the 
dispatcher: 'The only other thing that I have done was the Ketner Lake 
incident where the woman got attacked. That was me.'

In
 the attack on the jogger, investigator Michael Lynch testified that 
Sigg used homemade chloroform to attempt to subdue the woman. She 
escaped.
