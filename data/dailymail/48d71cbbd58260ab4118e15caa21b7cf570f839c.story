The federal website has revealed that it received 2 million visits on Monday, and heavy - but not as heavy - traffic on Tuesday after announcing a later enrollment deadline.

A White House spokeswoman said there was no immediate estimate of visitors or how many succeeded in obtaining insurance before the deadline, nor did they explain who will receive the extension and how long they will be given to try again before facing fines.

It was
 the administration's latest attempt to move the goalposts as it tries to 
recover from technical failures and political missteps that dogged the 
enrollment drive after it opened on October 1.

Trying to make 
up for lost time, the administration has announced a series of 
last-minute changes and delays to get as many people as possible covered
 under the Affordable Care Act.

A computer screen reads, 'Enroll by Dec. 23 for coverage starting as soon as Jan 1'

Before Monday's rush, more than 1 million people had 
signed up for private coverage through HealthCare.gov - which serves 36 
states - and 14 state-run marketplaces, according to state and federal 
estimates. 

The figure, though likely to climb by Christmas, is 
still short of previous estimates that 7 million people could enroll by 
the end of March, the last date to obtain health insurance coverage in 
2014.

About one-third or more will need to be young, healthy adults 
whose payments into the system would help offset the costs of covering 
older, sicker people.

'Sometimes despite your best efforts, you 
might have run into delays caused by heavy traffic to HealthCare.gov, 
maintenance periods, or other issues with our systems that prevented you
 from finishing the process on time,' Tuesday's blog post on 
HealthCare.gov said.

'If this happened to you, don't worry - we still 
may be able to help you get covered as soon as January 1.'

The 
problematic rollout of the health law known as Obamacare, which was 
passed in 2010 and survived legal challenges, helped send Obama's 
popularity ratings to record lows and stepped up Republican efforts to 
gut the law and use it against Democrats in 2014 congressional 
elections.

Trying to make it work: President Obama, seen here at his last press conference of the year, has dedicated much of his presidency to enacting the health care legislation and Republican rivals plan to run against it in the midterms

The more recent changes, which the administration 
has said are intended to show flexibility, have introduced a new element
 of confusion for consumers as well as the health insurance companies 
who have been pressed by the government to allow new members to pay, and
 even sign up, past January 1 for retroactive coverage.

So far the 
industry has agreed to extend the first payment deadline to January 10.

'Health
 plans will continue to do everything they can to help consumers through
 the enrollment process and to mitigate potential confusion or 
disruption caused by all of these last minute changes to the rules and 
deadlines,' said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for American's Health 
Insurance Plans, an industry trade and lobbying group.

Elva Garcia (L) and Jorge Codevila were two of the millions who tried to sign up for the health care program before the first deadline of December 23, but that was later pushed back to December 24

The 
Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to be enrolled in coverage 
by March 31 or face penalties that start at $95. This week's deadline, 
which had already been moved to December 23 from December 15, applied to
 coverage starting on January 1. 

Last week, the administration 
said people whose plans were canceled because they did not meet new 
standards of coverage under the law would qualify for a 'hardship' 
exemption that allows some people to avoid a penalty for not signing up 
for health insurance. 

Several state-run exchanges have also moved
 their enrollment deadlines. New York and California, two of the 
largest, added a one-day grace period similar to the federal insurance 
marketplace.

Massachusetts said on Tuesday it would allow sign-ups until
 December 31 given heavy volume and technical problems that have 
hampered its exchange. Rhode Island, Oregon and Maryland had already 
extended their deadlines beyond Christmas.
