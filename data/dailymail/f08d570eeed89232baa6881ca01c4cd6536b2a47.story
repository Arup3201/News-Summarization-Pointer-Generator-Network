Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos was yesterday arrested on suspicion of supplying class A drugs.

The 24-year-old singer attended a police station ‘by appointment’ after allegedly being caught fixing the sale of £800 of cocaine in an undercover sting by a national newspaper.

Officers raided the £6million Hertfordshire mansion Miss Contostavlos is believed to be renting and were seen leaving with two bags. She returned to the property at 6.30pm.

Arrests: Former X Factor judge Tulisa has been arrested on suspicion of supplying class A drugs after a newspaper sting. She is pictured with rapper Mike GLC who allegedly sold £800 of cocaine to a reporter

Her arrest comes after footage emerged
 at the weekend which showed the singer reportedly boasting to journalists about how she could supply drugs through a dealer.

It was during this conversation at 
Nobu restaurant in Mayfair, West London, Miss Contostavlos is alleged to
 have claimed: ‘Half my phone book sells it. Of course I can get it for 
you.

‘Half the guys I know are drug 
dealers. One’s a massive cocaine dealer. He’s my best friend. He’s a 
gangster – he’s my gangster.’

It is then claimed she put the 
reporters in contact with a friend, rapper Mike GLC, who then allegedly 
sold half an ounce of cocaine worth £800 to them at London’s Dorchester 
Hotel.

He was also arrested, questioned and 
bailed by police yesterday. The rapper described himself as ‘distraught’
 and added: ‘It’s ruined my life. I’m not a drug dealer and I’ve never 
dealt drugs and I don’t have a record.’

Return: Tulisa arrived back at her home at 6.30pm tonight in a black Chrysler with blacked-out windows, and was driven straight into a garage, so she could not be seen. Her PA Gareth Varey is pictured running behind it

Miss Contostavlos reportedly 
explained how she used a coded ‘lingo’ with a dealer in which cocaine 
was ‘white sweets’ and cannabis ‘green sweets’.

'Half the guys I know are drug dealers. One’s a massive cocaine dealer. He’s my best friend. He’s a gangster – he’s my gangster'

She also claimed dealers used her to 
sell drugs as a teenager, adding: ‘Because I’m young and pretty and 
female, no one suspected me. So they would give me the drugs, I would 
get a cut out of it.’

Miss Contostavlos was last night bailed to return in July as police  continue their enquiries.

Yesterday her former X Factor  
colleagues Gary Barlow, Nicole Scherzinger and Louis Walsh reunited for 
the first day of auditions for the new series in Glasgow. They were 
joined by Miss Contostavlos’s replacement, Sharon Osbourne.

Searches: Detectives in plain clothes spent just over an hour at Tulisa's home yesterday afternoon before leaving with a large brown paper bag and a large clear bag

Loyal: The singer's £100,000 Audi R8 sports car has remained outside the house since Sunday and her entourage has had at least six boxes of pizza delivered to the property, seen here being collected by Mr Varey

Visit: On Sunday morning, hours after the newspaper expose, a police car was seen arriving at Tulisa's house

Allegations: The newspaper report claimed Tulisa (left) allegedly boasted to a tabloid reporter about her links to drugs and claimed to be able to get hold of 'whatever you want'. Her friend Mike GLC is seen (right) yesterday

Four officers – two men and two women –
 arrived at Miss Contostavlos’s three-storey mock Georgian manor house 
in an unmarked Ford Mondeo just after 3pm.

They left an hour later after being 
let in by her personal assistant Gareth Varey, who shrugged his 
shoulders when asked about her arrest.

A police spokesman said: ‘Officers 
from Westminster have arrested two people – a 35-year-old man and a 
24-year-old woman – by appointment at a Central London police station on
 suspicion of being concerned with the supply of class A drugs.’

A spokesman for Miss Contostavlos 
declined to comment. Earlier this week, it emerged she could lose up to 
£1million following the allegations.

Her biggest contract with clothing 
firm Bank is under threat after the company said it was considering 
pulling the star’s clothing range TFB and her image from its campaigns.

In his words: Mike GLC tweeted yesterday: 'What do d*** head artist thinks the rules changed because I'm in this madness keep making video and talking my name that's all I'm saying (sic)'

Miss Contostavlos left school without any qualifications after a troubled childhood on a north London council estate.

But she rose to fame with rappers 
N-Dubz before becoming a household name when Simon Cowell paid her 
£1million to be a judge on the X Factor two years ago.

The star has admitted using drugs in the past, but said she stopped at 14 and was an ‘inspiration for Broken Britain’.

However, last year she appeared to 
show affiliation to London gang the Crime Scene Boys, also known as the 
Church Road Soldiers, which she denied.

The allegation came after she made a 
‘C’ gesture while filming a music video in the Church End Estate in 
Harlesden, where the gang operates.
