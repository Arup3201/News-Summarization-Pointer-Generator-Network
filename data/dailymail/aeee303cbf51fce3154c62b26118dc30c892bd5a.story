The BBC is facing calls to make it harder for children to access unsuitable material on its website.

Critics claim the widespread use of the corporation’s iPlayer catch-up service has made the watershed redundant.

With growing concern about violent and gory BBC shows such as Ripper Street and The Fall, campaigners have claimed the corporation should try and find ways of making it tougher to enforce age limits.

At the moment people calling up programmes on the service only need to tick a box confirming they are over 16 to watch adult material. The BBC does offer a parental lock but many households do not use this.

Even young users of the service admit the ‘tick box’ method is fundamentally flawed in stopping youngsters watching adult material.

Claude Knights, Kidscape director said: ‘Obviously iPlayer has in a sense circumvented the watershed. It is really completely wrong to say we have a watershed anymore.’

She added: ‘The parents need support and help. They need to understand, they don’t always know what youngsters are doing, or indeed understand if they are doing X or Y how to protect them from that.

‘So many parents claim not to have enough information about parental controls…. certainly the parents need to play a part, but yes, the iPlayer mechanism needs to address it too.

‘What more can they do, what more can be done to make it harder for anyone to pretend to be younger or young people to make a concerted effort to get into that system?’

She added: ‘The more difficult you make something, obviously you will stop a percentage of the viewing.’

Vivienne Pattison of pressure group Mediawatch UK has also previously said: ‘I have been talking about the BBC having tougher safeguards for its iPlayer programmes for years but always get the same response: that it has to be something that seriously harms the mental or physical health of a child and nothing on the iPlayer will do this.

‘Actually with some of those dramas we are getting to the stage where if a young child watches it, yes it could do.’

Even youngsters on Twitter make jokes about how ineffective the BBC’s procedure is.

One wrote: ‘The way BBC iPlayer asks if 
I'm 16 or over. Like I'm going to sit there and be like “Ah, you’ve got 
me! You clever little tick box, machine”.’

Another wrote: ‘Parental guidance on BBC iPlayer is strict. "Tick this if you are over 16". I bet there are devastated 15 year olds all over the place. Foiled.’

The BBC iPlayer does give viewers the option to select a Parental Guidance Lock, a password-based system to control access to guidance-labelled programming.

This covers programmes that may be unsuitable for young audiences, like sex and violence, or programmes that may be harmful to view, such as flashing images.

It also provides ‘guidance labelling’ on the site to make viewers aware of the content.

A BBC spokesman said: 'BBC iPlayer has controls in place to safeguard children from viewing and listening to guidance-labelled programming.'
