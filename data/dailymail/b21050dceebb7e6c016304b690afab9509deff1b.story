Iranian patrol boats and aircraft shadowed a U.S. aircraft carrier strike group as it travelled through the Strait of Hormuz yesterday.

The passage ended a Gulf mission that displayed Western naval power amid heightened tensions with Tehran, which has threatened to choke off vital oil shipping lanes.

Officers aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln said there were no incidents with Iranian forces and described the surveillance as routine measures by Tehran near the strategic strait, which is jointly controlled by Iran and Oman.

Although U.S. warships have passed through the strait for decades, the trip comes during an escalating showdown between Iran and the West over the Islamic Republic's nuclear program.

The last time an American carrier left the Gulf - the USS John C Stennis in late December - Iran's army chief warned the U.S. it should never return.

The Abraham Lincoln was the centrepiece of a flotilla that entered the Gulf last month along with British and French warships in a display of Western unity against Iranian threats. There was no immediate comment by Iran about the Abraham Lincoln's departure.

Iran's Revolutionary Guard has said it plans its own naval exercises near the strait, the route for a fifth of the world's oil supply, but Iran's military has made no attempts to disrupt oil tanker traffic.

Two American warships, one in front and one in the rear, escorted the Abraham Lincoln on its midday journey through the strait and into the Arabian Sea after nearly three weeks in the Gulf, an area which is frequently visited by U.S. warships and includes the headquarters of the U.S. 5th Fleet in Bahrain.

The small but important strait is only about 30miles across at its narrowest point.

On one side, the barren, fjord-like mountains of Oman were visible through the haze.

Iran's coast was just beyond the horizon on the other side of the ship, but too far away to be seen.

Gunners in red jerseys manned the 50-caliber machine guns as the ships moved out of the Gulf. An Iranian patrol boat pulled nearby.

Later, just after the Abraham Lincoln rounded the 'knuckle' - the nub of Oman jutting out at the southern end of the strait - an Iranian patrol plane buzzed overhead. Another patrol boat was waiting further down the coast.

Besides Iran's regular patrol boats, the Revolutionary Guard operates a large number of small, fast-attack boats. Some are armed with only a machine gun, while others also carry anti-ship missiles.

They can be difficult to spot because they resemble the swift-moving smuggling boats that ply the strait.

Rear Admiral Troy Shoemaker, commander
of the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Force said none of those fast 
boats appeared on Tuesday, likely deterred by the rough seas.

He
predicted before the transit that the Iranians would likely keep a 
close eye on the Lincoln throughout its passage, including with 
ground-based radars, and wasn't surprised by the attention from Iranian 
forces.

He said: 'We would 
do the same things off the coast of the United States... It's more than 
reasonable. We're operating in their backyard. We've been doing it for 
years.'

Several U.S. choppers flanked the 
carrier group throughout the transit, watching out for potentially 
hostile vessels and relaying real-time pictures back to the Lincoln's 
crew.

Dozens of F/A-18 strike fighters and 
other planes in Lincoln's embarked air wing sat parked silently on deck 
throughout the trip.

Yesterday was a no-fly day for their crews, though some
fighters were prepped and armed, ready to launch in as little as 15 
minutes should things go wrong.

Officers
on board were eager to describe the transit, in which the Lincoln was 
accompanied by the cruiser USS Cape St. George and destroyer USS 
Sterett, as a routine manoeuvre despite the growing speculation that 
Israel could launch a military strike against Iran's nuclear program.

The U.S. and allies fear Iran's 
uranium enrichment program could eventually lead to the production of 
weapons-grade nuclear material. Iran claims it only seeks reactors for 
energy and medical research.

'I wouldn't characterise us going 
through the strait as: ”Hey, this is a huge show of force, we're coming 
through.” It's an international strait to transit. We're going from one 
body of water to the other,' said Captain John Alexander, the Lincoln's 
commanding officer, as preparations for the trip got under way late on 
Monday.

The Lincoln is expected to provide air support for the Nato mission in Afghanistan, starting on Thursday.

Navy brass in the Gulf say another American carrier is due back through the strait soon, but gave no firm timetable.
