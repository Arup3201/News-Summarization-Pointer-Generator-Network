Manchester City are in talks over a £35million deal to sign Porto centre back Eliaquim Mangala and his team-mate Fernando.

They may struggle to pull off the double transfer before Friday’s 11pm deadline  but City are determined to seal the deals no later than this summer.

They have been encouraged by a significant shift in Porto’s position over the last 48 hours after the cash-strapped  Portuguese club indicated they are willing to reduce the asking price if it means having the money in the bank now.

Hitting the heights: Frenchman Mangala has been tracked by City for some time

City have been tracking Mangala, 22, for some time knowing the buyout clause in the Frenchman’s contract is £37.8m. Porto value Fernando, 26, at £7m even though the defensive midfielder from Brazil will be a free agent in the summer.

However, it is understood that a joint figure of £35m could be agreed if City are prepared to do business before Friday's deadline.

That would be another remarkable statement of intent by Manuel Pellegrini’s side, who have taken the Barclays  Premier League by storm after spending more than £100m on new signings last summer.

Mangala has interested a number of top clubs including Manchester United, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, but Pellegrini identified the former Standard Liege defender as his top target some time ago.

The City manager has been in the hunt for a new centre back since last summer, when he failed to sign Pepe from Real Madrid and then compromised by bringing in Martin Demichelis from neighbours Atletico.

The uncertainty over the Mangala deal is believed to be the reason why Joleon Lescott’s future at City has been left in the balance.

A deal is in place for Lescott to join West Ham, with the England defender desperate for regular first-team football to safeguard his World Cup hopes. Equally, the bid for Fernando will cast further doubt over the City futures of Jack Rodwell and Javi Garcia, neither of whom has impressed since arriving in 2012.

Meanwhile, Pellegrini is set to be without top scorer Sergio Aguero for Monday’s match with Chelsea at the Etihad after the Argentina striker limped out of Wednesday’s 5-1 win at Tottenham with a hamstring injury.

Aguero could face a race to be fit for the Champions League showdown with Barcelona next month.

At £28million, Eliaquim Mangala seems rather pricey for an unknown centre half currently playing in Portugal?

Maybe, but believe it or not, City are getting him on the cheap. The 22-year-old’s buy-out clause at Porto is £37.8m, and only the attraction of up-front cash from Manchester is persuading them to let him go for less.

He began his career with Standard Liege in Belgium  — is Vincent Kompany set to welcome a fellow countryman to the Etihad?

No, Mangala is actually French. Born in the Parisian suburb of Colombes, his family moved to Belgium when he was five to live in the French-speaking town of Namur. Mangala qualified for a Belgian passport, but elected to answer a call-up from France’s Under 21 squad after making his name at Liege, and won his first full cap in a friendly against Uruguay last June, two years after his £6.5m move to Porto.

He’s used to moving around then?

Yes, off and on the pitch. He began life as a striker growing up in Belgium, but switched to left back when he joined Liege. He then shone as a deep-lying midfielder, but eventually ended up as a stylish central defender.

Does he have any previous experience of English football?

He certainly does. At the age of just 18, Mangala scored Standard Liege’s first ever Champions League goal, in September 2009, against Arsenal. He’s been on the radar of the Premier  League’s big boys ever since.
