Thousands of Russell Hobbs irons have been recalled after reports that some burst into flames and injured customers. 

The company has withdrawn 15 different models and advised anyone affected to stop using their iron immediately.

But it was revealed that the company was first made aware of the danger 18 months ago and only decided to recall the affected products after an expose by BBC's Watchdog programme.

Russell Hobbs recalled 15 models, including this SteamGlide iron, after a BBC Watchdog probe, but it was revealed the company was first made aware of the fault 18 months ago

Karen Givens, of Southport, Merseyside, suffered burns and an electric shock when her SuperGlide steam iron blew up.

Her husband Bill told The Mirror he is considering taking legal action, adding: 'It's unbelievable that a company of this size didn't recall the irons as soon as they knew about the problem over a year ago.'

But managing director Tim Wright defended the decision and said: 'I would like to apologise to the people that have been injured by one of these irons.

'This absolutely was not our intention and we work very hard as a brand to ensure that we bring products to market that are fit for purpose.' 

A statement on the Russell Hobbs website says: 'As part of our ongoing quality monitoring program, we've identified an issue with a small number of our irons, that may carry a risk that the flex may fail.

'If you do have an affected iron, please stop using it immediately.' 

The Russell Hobbs website warns: 'If you do have an affected iron, please stop using it immediately'

Angry customers posted pictures to the Russell Hobbs Facebook page including complainants who say their iron caught fire while they were using it.

Rebecca Scurr wrote: 'Just want to warn people of potential danger my husband was ironing today when it caught fire and burnt him. 

'Lucky he quickly threw it to the floor (damaging our kitchen floor) could of been a lot worse'.

She later added that customer services had been 'fantastic' in handling her complaint. 

Another customer, Clare Joanna, posted a picture to the Facebook page of her injured hand after using the iron in August. 

She wrote: 'Today when using the Russel Hobbs Steam Glide iron it suddenly sparked and has burnt my hand badly.

'The electrical burn is incredibly painful and I would not want anyone else to go through this.' 

The model number is located on a label the underside of the heel of the iron. 

Those that are affected are: 18651, 18742, 19220, 19221, 18743, 19840, 18720, 15081, 19222, 19400, 20260, 18741, 20280, 20550-10, 20560-10.

Jonathan Wells told BBC programme Watchdog that his iron failed in June this year. 

He said: 'I realised from the pain in my hand that came straight after it that the iron had caught fire somehow and burned my hand.

'The pain was getting so bad I had to go into the kitchen and run it under the cold tap for probably about an hour.'

Russell Hobbs have apologised to customers for any inconvenience caused and are offering a replacement or refund. 

Mr Wright added the flex in question is no longer being used. 

He said: 'When the problems, however isolated, with the particular flex that was being used in a few batches of our irons became apparent, we started working with Trading Standards to monitor the situation.  

'We take our responsibilities as a manufacturer very seriously and customer safety is always our first priority, and it is because of these factors that we decided to issue the product recall.' 

A company spokesman said: 'The company's primary concern is, as ever, for the safety of their consumers. Russell Hobbs has always taken their responsibilities as a manufacturer extremely seriously. 

'The decision to recall these products has been taken with the utmost consideration for the public.' 

Russell Hobbs say customers with one of these models should also check the batch code, which is written at the bottom of the label. 

They say: 'If it starts with 045 through to 365 and ends with 12 or starts with 001 through to 195 and ends with 13, then you have an affected iron.'

Affected customers are advised to call Russell Hobbs's customer service department on 0800 307 7616 or, from a mobile, 0333 103 9663.
