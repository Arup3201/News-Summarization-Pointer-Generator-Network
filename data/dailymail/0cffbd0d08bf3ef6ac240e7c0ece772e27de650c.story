A business manager who was run over by a thug in a getaway car after he helped a policewoman in danger insists risking his own life was worth it for the good of British society.

Christopher Price, 57, received a standing ovation from police officers as the only member of the public to be recognised for bravery at a special ceremony in London this month.

In a brave bid to stop a fleeing 
suspect who attacked a female PC, the father-of-three from Hampstead, north London, threw himself
into the path of a car as the driver slammed into gear and drove 
straight at him.

But the modest hero insists he was simply doing what he 'needed to do' and instead paid tribute to the bravery police show every day.

Brave: Christopher Price stands close to where he was run down after trying to stop a criminal get away

'You get the society you deserve if you’re prepared to put the effort in,' he said after receiving a certificate of commendation at Camden Town Hall.

'I happened to be there at the time and that was what I needed to do. I wasn’t prepared to see someone get pushed around on the street.'

Danger: Mr Price could have been killed when he tried to intervene when a policewoman was in trouble in Prince Arthur Road in Hampstead

Mr Price added: 'I was particularly impressed and touched by the 
standing ovation from officers, some of whom have effectively disarmed 
people with guns when they were unarmed.

'That is real heroism, that is amazing, I just got into a situation and I did what I did to help.'

Mr Price noticed a man running into Prince Arthur Road in Hampstead 
chased by a policewoman on June 20 this year. Shopkeepers had earlier 
seen two men acting suspiciously as an elderly woman used a cash point 
in Hampstead High Street and called police.

One man was arrested as officers arrived but a scuffle broke out as the other man tried to escape.

Mr Price, who was walking from a business meeting in the area, 
spotted the policewoman being thrown about and decided to step in.

'In true pantomime style, I was shouting, "He’s behind you" and she 
tried to grab him but he was a big athletic Usain Bolt-like man,' he 
said.

'She grabbed hold of him and he threw her away so I went to help.'

As Mr Price approached the man climbed into a nearby getaway car and locked the doors.

The policewoman then smashed the driver’s window with her baton as Mr
Price tried to get into the passenger’s side, before coming around to 
the front of the car.

'He then decided he was going to blow me out of the way,' said Mr 
Price. 'He slammed it into first gear and drove straight at me, I did a 
roll over the bonnet and smashed down quite hard.'

The collision left Mr Price needing hospital treatment for bruising and damage to his hip and knee.

Police have since indentified the driver, who remains at large, and 
have issued a warrant for his arrest on suspicion of grievous bodily 
harm with intent.

Paying tribute to Mr Price Chief superintendent John Sutherland, 
Camden borough commander, said: 'We live in
a world where all too often people walk by when circumstances demand 
they do something, but today is about recognising the people who didn’t 
walk by.'

It came as police officers are due to be honoured for acts of bravery tonight, including dragging passengers from burning cars and confronting armed criminals without a weapon themselves.

A total of 53 from forces across the country have been nominated for the annual Police Bravery Awards, held to recognise officers who have risked their lives in the line of duty.

The event has a particular resonance this
year following the deaths of PCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes who were 
shot dead after attending what appeared to be a routine burglary call in 
Hattersley, Greater Manchester.

Tragic: PC Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes were 
gunned down in an attack that has shocked Britain and they will be 
remembered at the Police Bravery Awards tonight

Off-duty PC Ian Dibell from Essex Police 
also lost his life when he was gunned down as he went to help a 
neighbour who was being attacked.

The nominated officers have been invited to a lunch time reception at Downing Street before the awards ceremony in the City of London later on Thursday, which will be attended by Home Secretary Theresa May.

David Cameron will not be at Number 10 because he will be out of the country.

One officer, PC Carl Jones, based in Wiltshire, was called to a domestic incident when the man involved suddenly pulled a gun from behind a sofa and shot at him three times.

Several of the tales of bravery involve officers throwing themselves into icy water to save people from drowning, or intervening to foil armed robberies.
