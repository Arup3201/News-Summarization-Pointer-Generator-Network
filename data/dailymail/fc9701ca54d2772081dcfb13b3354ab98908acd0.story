A woman who has spent the month growing a moustache has been so pleased with people's reactions that she's considering keeping it. 

Sarah O'Neill was once dubbed 'Mac3' due to having an excess of facial hair as a result of suffering from polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

One of the most common symptoms is a high level of male hormones (androgens), which leads to hair growth, meaning she would spend hours shaving and waxing her face.

Sarah O'Neill has facial hair on her upper lip and chin as a result of suffering from polycystic ovarian syndrome. She decided to grow a moustache for Movember to highlight the problem and raise awareness

But Miss O'Neill, 29, decided to ditch the razor at the start of the month and embrace her moustache for Movember, and raise awareness of her condition. 

She said: 'It was a spur of the moment decision after coming home from work feeling very embarrassed about how my facial hair had come through.'

While she would usually be clean-shaven and use tweezers to remove stray hairs, she hasn't touched her facial hair for 30 days.

Miss O'Neill, from Hull, said: 'I decided that it's part of me, so why should I hide it to please other people?

'I wanted people to know that I'm not lazy or unclean, it's just a medical condition.'

Polycystic ovarian syndrome is the main cause of excess hair in women. 
It's estimated to affect 10 to 15 per cent of women and is when the ovaries don’t work properly and are covered 
in small cysts.

As a result, eggs are released erratically or not at 
all, causing irregular or missed periods, and often reduced fertility 
and acne.

One of the most common symptoms is a high level of male hormones (androgens), which leads to hair growth. 

Comfortable: Miss O'Neill, with her fiance Tina, said: 'I felt really self-conscious at first, but when I told people my facial hair was due to a medical condition, they understood and were actually really supportive'

Miss O'Neill, who works for a kitchen and beds company, was diagnosed with PCOS in 2006, after she started suffering with other symptoms, such as such weight gain and irregular periods. 

As Movember loomed closer this year, she decided it was time to banish the myth that only men grow moustaches and take part in the charity event. 

The fundraising challenge is usually reserved for men and sees people being sponsored to grow their facial hair for prostate cancer and men's mental health.

Miss O'Neill said: 'I felt really self conscious at first but I found that if I told people who started staring at me why I was doing it and that it was due to a medical condition, they understood and were actually really supportive.

'The hair has been really itchy and prickly but now it's come through more I'm getting used to it.'

She is now considering keeping the moustache after her confidence grew. 

She added: 'I have had so much more confidence towards the second half of the month. 

Support: Miss O'Neill says she has been 'overwhelmed by the generosity of strangers' who have donated to her cause, and thanked her for bringing the condition to light

'I feel a lot more comfortable in my own skin. I'm
not sure what to do now. It has brought me a lot of happiness having 
this on my face and being able to tell people about it, and I don't want
to undo any good work. 

'I might keep it because it's part of who I am and it's OK to be me. The only downside is I look like my brother.'

'I moved jobs at the start of the month and told my manager straight away, and everyone at work has been right behind me.'

She has currently raised around £800 over the month, and she is planning on donating the cash to men's charities.

'It's raising the profile of the condition and getting the issue out there,' she said. 'My money is still going towards the men's charities - I've just taken part in it.'

She said she has been 'overwhelmed by the generosity of strangers' who have donated to her cause, and thanked her for bringing the condition to light. 

'It's something you have to deal with and people have felt ashamed, as I did in the past, but I think I have brought it to the fore,' she said. 

'People have experienced shame but I've highlighted that it's a medical condition, and most people have understood. 

'I have been amazed with how generous people have been and I'm really thankful to everyone who has donated money for such a good cause.'

She added that her fiancee Tina had been a great source of support. 'Tina has been my rock, and I couldn't have done it without her. 

'She's encouraged me all along the way - she told me to go for it and she's been fantastic in keeping me going throughout the month.'

Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome is the main cause of excess hair in women. 
It's estimated to affect 10 to 15 percent of women and is when the ovaries don’t work properly and are covered 
in small cysts.

As a result, eggs are released erratically or not at 
all, causing irregular or missed periods, and often reduced fertility 
and acne.

One of the most common symptoms is a high level of male hormones (androgens), which leads to hair growth.

All
women produce androgens. However, sometimes women produce higher 
levels, or they may have normal levels, but their hair follicles are 
more sensitive to androgens.

'If
excess hair is due to a hormonal imbalance, then it tends to occur in 
areas such as the chin, upper lip, sideburns, chest and inner thighs,' 
says Dr Rina Davison, an endocrinologist from Whipps Cross University Hospital, London, with a special interest in excess hair.

'These are areas of the skin that are more sensitive to testosterone. The hair is also likely to be coarse and dark.'

Given
the implications for fertility, women worried about excess hair should 
see their GP, advises Steve Franks, professor of reproductive 
endocrinology at Imperial College, London and an endocrinologist at St 
Mary’s and Hammersmith Hospitals, London.

'There
may be other problems to investigate,' he suggests. 'Often, excess hair
is a symptom of PCOS, but it also can be indicative of less common, but
potentially more serious, hormonal disorders, or tumours of the ovary 
or adrenal gland - the two parts of the body that produce testosterone.

'Women should not be afraid to ask for a referral to a specialist.'

The
alarm bells should ring for a GP if a woman comes in with a growth of 
facial hair that has developed within the past six months, he adds.
