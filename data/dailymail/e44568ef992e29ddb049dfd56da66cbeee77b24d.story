Let's hope these rather terrifying photos won't be making it into the baby album.

Fiona, 28, from the UK decided to use the phone app YouCam Makeup on her newborn boy.

Little Gabriel is seen looking at the camera with various make-up looks superimposed on his face.

In one photo he models a black cropped wig, stenciled eyebrows, purple eye shadow and red lipstick. His look is finished off with a set of piercing bright blue eyes.

Fiona said she had great fun using the app on seven-week-old Gabriel.

'It helps to pass the long hours of crying!' she said.
