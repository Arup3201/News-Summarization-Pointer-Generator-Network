A premature baby has defied the odds to survive despite doctors recommending her family turn off her life support machine seven times.

Kenda Mohamed was born 13 weeks early weighing just 1.4lbs and suffered a number of serious conditions and infections.

Her parents, Saleh and Halima Eltbawi, couldn't hold her for three months and were told to expect the worst.

They were even given the option of switching off her life support seven times.

However, they never gave up hope of her recovering and following four major operations their seven-month-old daughter is now on the road to recovery.

Her father, Saleh, 31, of Aberdeen, said: ‘The doctors took us to a small room in the hospital seven times to ask us if we would consider turning her life support machine off because she wasn't going to make it.

‘They were just making sure we were aware of the situation and letting us know that they should probably just stop treatment now as they were only prolonging her life by a week or two.

‘But we told them we couldn't give up on her. That's why we think she is a miracle, because nobody told us that she was going to make it.

‘The probabilities of her recovery were very, very slim but we are so happy to see Kenda the way she is now - she keeps surprising us with her progress.’

She was so unwell that her parents, Saleh and Halima Eltbawi, couldn't hold her for three months and were told to expect the worst - doctors even suggested seven times that her life support was turned off

She had four major operations shortly after her birth because she developed a bleed on the brain, a serious eye condition and numerous infections

When the baby was born at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary at 24 weeks in October she was the size of her father’s hand.

She went through four major operations in the first few weeks of her life as she suffered bleeding on the brain and a number of serious infections.

She also had an eye disease which nearly blinded her, and swelling which caused her body to double in size.

Her parents refused to give up hope and kept deciding to give her a chance of survival. She is now seven-months-old and her parents describe her as a 'miracle'

Kenda's parents do not know whether she will ever be able to walk or talk but say that they continue to hope that she will be able to lead an independent life

Mr Mohamed, who is originally from Libya, said: ‘The progress she's made is quite remarkable.

There's a photo when she's a few weeks old and she's smaller than my hand.

‘Kenda's chances of survival were rated at 30 per cent, then 10 per cent and then we were told she wasn't going to make it through the night.

‘I'm not blaming the doctors, as they were just being honest about what they believed at the time, but we live in hope that Kenda can continue to surprise them.

‘We don't know if she will ever be able to walk or talk, it's just too early, but we're still keeping our hope that she will be able to lead an independent life.’
