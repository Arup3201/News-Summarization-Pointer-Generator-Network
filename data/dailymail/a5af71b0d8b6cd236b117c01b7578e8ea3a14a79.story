Alexis Sanchez cannot wait to team up with Mesut Ozil and help fire Arsenal towards Premier League glory.

The Chile international on Thursday agreed to sign for the Gunners from Barcelona, in a deal reported to be worth in the region of £30million.

Sanchez - who is set for some time on holiday following his World Cup exploits, reaching the last 16 with Chile before being beaten on penalties by Brazil - believes Arsenal now have the needed quality to last the distance in the title race, having fallen away after being top at the turn of the year.

Alexis Sanchez signs for Arsenal: Here's how the £30million signing will look in the new kit

Set to shine: Sanchez is looking forward to team up with £42.5m man Mesut Ozil to win titles

'With Ozil in the squad Arsenal was (close) to winning the league title (last season). I hope I can make a contribution so we can win as many titles as possible,' Sanchez said on the club's official website, www.arsenal.com.

'The team not only plays really good football, but the squad is really good and we can win silverware.

'We have a great squad and we are a big club. We can achieve big things.

'Playing regularly wasn't the only reason why I came here - I came here to win the league title, the Champions League and every title at stake.

'I am here to win titles and to achieve as much as possible.'

Closing a deal for Sanchez - who also had interest from Liverpool and Juventus - was down in no small part to the influence of Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger.

The Gunners boss is understood to have spoken to the player face to face while working for French television at the World Cup in Brazil, convincing him the Emirates Stadium was the right place to further his career.

The 25-year-old attacking midfielder, said to have also taken counsel from former Arsenal captain and Barcelona team-mate Cesc Fabregas, who has signed for Chelsea, is in no doubt he will be given the perfect environment in which to flourish.

'I know this club has a manager that looks after his players and takes care of them as well,' Sanchez continued.

'I was told that he is a manager you can learn a lot with. He wants to achieve great things in football and that helped me make the decision to sign for Arsenal.

'Arsene Wenger's style of play is the sort of style the Chilean national team has, so therefore I am used to it.

'Arsenal plays very well, which fits my style. That is why I moved here.

'The manager has mentioned some certain positions, but I am not worried about it right now. The manager and I will talk about my role as soon as I start training.

'Arsenal is a club that cares about the players and I can learn a lot here.'

Wenger will return to Arsenal's Hertfordshire base after Sunday's World Cup final, ahead of a trip to New York at the end of the month.

Arsenal host the Emirates Cup on August 2/3, which is likely to present a debut for Sanchez, who has no doubts about being able to settle into the English game.

He said: 'The most important thing is to be calm and not to rush things. Everything will be fine as long as I take it easy and calm down, But I am also looking forward to showing why I am here.'

Arsenal are expected to further bolster their squad ahead of the FA Community Shield against Manchester City on August 10.

France defender Mathieu Debuchy is keen to move from Newcastle, who want to secure a replacement before closing out the £10million transfer, while Atletico Madrid right-back Javier Manquillo another reported target.

A defensive midfielder is also on Wenger's wanted list. Arsenal have been linked with Germany internationals Lars Bender and Sami Khedira.
