Inspired by a fairground ride, this one of a kind pod brings together futuristic exteriors and cozy decor, for a product that's reminiscent of a mountain chalet.

It may seem like an odd combination, but the result is nothing short of breathtaking.

The Refuge Tonneau, originally designed by Charlotte Perriand and Pierre Jeanneret in 1938, has now been brought to life - thanks to Italian design firm, Cassina.

The ingenious pod combines a futuristic aesthetic with a cosy mountain cabin-inspired wood interior

The futuristic space shuttle-meets-mountain cabin is made up of lightweight aluminum panels on the outside, but full of homey wood accents on the inside.

It was originally developed by Charlotte Perriand as a mobile mountain refuge that could battle even the most extreme weather conditions.

And the dodecahedron's reconstruction has stayed true to their design.

Lightweight aluminum panelling allows for the pod to be pitched anywhere and its wind resistant shell offers increased stability.

The legs are even adjustable to adapt to uneven terrain. 

The pod has two floors and can accommodate up to eight guests - including four on the upper level (pictured)

The entire pod is two floors and can accommodate up to eight guests. It also boasts a wood stove, foldable single beds - thanks to a system of leather belts - and a mezzanine with two doubles, as well as a wash basin to melt snow.

Extremely functional, the Refuge Tonneau allows adventure-seekers to embrace nature in a very intense way, while also providing a beautiful minimalist space for rest and relaxation.

Speaking about the project, Barbara Lehmann, Head of the Cassina Historical Archives, told MailOnline: 'The reconstruction was a very important research project carried out by Cassina in close collaboration with the daughter of Charlotte Perriand.

'It was essential to respect the original drawings, but also to discover further details, particularly for the interiors, by looking at other projects designed by Perriand and Jeanneret. 

'The relationship between the human body and the way it interacts with the living space was fundamental in the design of Charlotte Perriand's furniture, as was the use of natural materials available to the architects at the time.' 

Seventy years in the making, the general public got a first glimpse at the architectural marvel  during the Salone de Mobile at the Milan Design Village in 2012.
