The FBI is attempting to find missing Wall Street Journal reporter David Bird who mysteriously disappeared from his home in New Jersey on Saturday January 11.The FBI is helping the Long Hill Township Police Department find David Bird,55, who told his wife he was going to go on a short walk--without his cell phone and daily medication, reports Fox News.

He was recovering from a gastrointestinal virus when he disappeared, leaving vital medication he has to take twice a day for a liver transplant.

Bird was an avid hiker and his decision to go on a 'short walk' the day of his disappearance was not uncommon

Police searched the woods and river near
 his home, but there had been no sign of the 55-year-old until his 
credit card was reportedly used on Wednesday night.

According to NBC News, the card was used for a purchase in Mexico, and the family believe Mr Bird's disappearance may be connected to his coverage of Opec.

Mr Bird, a father-of-two, covered energy markets for the Wall Street Journal, and works for the Dow Jones.

Mr Bird's reports on the organization tended to be straightforward news pieces, leading others to also dismiss the connection between his disappearance and the group as nothing more than rumors.

A call to the Morris County Prosecutor's Officer to confirm reports of the card being used has not yet been returned.

Police Chief Michael Mazzeo told the Echoes-Sentinel on Thursday morning that the 'only thing to report is that he is still missing'.

The FBI has conducted searches in the 
surrounding land including swamps, the nearby Passaic River, and the 
railroad tracks but there is still no sign of the missing reporter.

David Bird's credit card was allegedly used in Mexico but police have not been able to track the person who used his card

Fox news reports that a source told them there has been no evidence to suggest foul play but that 't hasn't been ruled out' and that 'anything is possible'

The Newark Star Ledger reports that police are investigating his phone and computer to look for any clues that may lead them to him but there is nothing so far.

Bird was last seen wearing a distinct bright red jacket with two yellow zippers. He is white, 6 feet tall, i inch tall and weighs around 200 pounds.

Anyone with information about his disappearance are asked to call The Long Hill Township Police Department at 908-647-1800.
