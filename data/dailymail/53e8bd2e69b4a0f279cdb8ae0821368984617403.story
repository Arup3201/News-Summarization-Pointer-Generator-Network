When Dante Exum was born his father Cecil, who used to play alongside Michael Jordon during college, took a basketball to the Melbourne hospital and placed it in his son's tiny hands.

It ignited a lifelong fascination with the sport that has now made him a multi-millionaire, after the 18-year-old was drafted by NBA franchise the Utah Jazz, signing a two-year deal worth just over $9 million.

The 198cm tall point guard, dubbed 'The Boy Wonder from Down Under' and 'International Man of Mystery' by US media, was selected by the Jazz with the fifth pick in New York, and announced: 'I'm just a kid from Melbourne, Australia.'

Exum joins fellow Aussies Andrew Bogut (Golden State Warriors), Patty Mills (San Antonio Spurs), Aron Baynes (Spurs) and Matthew Dellavedova (Cleveland Cavaliers) in the NBA.

Australian teenager Dante Exum, from Melbourne, was the 5th pick in the US National Basketball Association draft. He shakes the hand of NBA Commissioner Adam Silver in New York

The 198cm tall point guard, dubbed 'The Boy Wonder from Down Under' and 'International Man of Mystery' by US media, was selected by the Utah Jazz on Thursday in New York

Bogut was selected number one overall in 2005, as was Melbourne-born Kyrie Irving in 2011 - while Mills was crowned an NBA champion just days ago when his team the San Antonio Spurs beat LeBron James and the Miami Heat in the Finals series.

The 18-year-old was considered a wildcard in the draft held in Brooklyn, New York, because he didn't play US college basketball and most NBA executives, coaches and scouts had never seen him play a game in person.

'I'm just a kid from Melbourne, Australia,' said Exum later, dressed in a grey suit and with a Jazz cap on his head.

'I guess right now I just got drafted so I guess I'm not a mystery anymore.'

Exum was expected to go to the 76ers with the third pick, or possibly No.1 with the Cleveland Cavaliers, but slid down to the Jazz.

The 76ers are mentored by former Australian Olympic coach Brett Brown but the team went for University of Kansas centre Joel Embiid.

The Orlando Magic also passed on Exum with the fourth pick.

The Cleveland Cavaliers used their No.1 selection on another Kansas player, forward Andrew Wiggins, while the Milwaukee Bucks took Duke forward Jabari Parker second.

Exum has already cashed in with major endorsement deals with companies including adidas and Red Bull.

He will sign a two-year contract with the Jazz worth about $US4.5 million ($A4.87 million) each year.

Like most kids from Melbourne, Exum played Australian rules growing up, but he says his dad steered him to basketball.

Despite having the height and freakish speed and jumping ability, Exum jokes that he wouldn't have made it to the AFL anyway because he was not able to kick the ball.

The teenager attended Lake Ginninderra Secondary College in Canberra in conjunction with the Australian Institute of Sport.

Australia will likely have a sixth NBA player later on Friday, with University of New Mexico power forward Cameron Bairstow expected to be selected in the second round.
