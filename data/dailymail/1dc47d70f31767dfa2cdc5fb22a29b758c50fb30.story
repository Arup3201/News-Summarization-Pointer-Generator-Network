A father who refused to hand over the money he had been saving for Christmas gifts to two robbers was shot and killed Sunday night. 

Miguel Haro of Chicago, Illinois, a 44-year-old father with two daughters was working a construction job to make some extra money for his daughters holiday presents when he and his coworker were approached by two robbers.

The men pistol whipped the two, and when Miguel, who does not speak English, was hesitant to hand over his wallet he was shot repeatedly by the men, dying soon after.
