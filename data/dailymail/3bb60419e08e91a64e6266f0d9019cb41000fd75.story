England's Max Whitlock won his third gold of the Commonwealth Games as he was crowned men's floor champion at the SSE Hydro on Thursday.

Whitlock claimed the title with a score of 15.533 after a near-faultless routine which was full of flair, finishing ahead of Canada's Scott Morgan who took silver with 15.133 while 14.550 gave New Zealand's David Bishop bronze.

The 21-year-old Englishman added the top floor accolade to Tuesday's team gold and Wednesday's all-around title, with finals on the pommel horse, rings and parallel bars still to come.

Bishop was first on the floor and tumbled well to set a strong early target, before Wales' Clinton Purnell moved into second place with a tally of 14.366.

England's Kristian Thomas missed out on the chance to add to the team gold he won on Tuesday as he bounced out of bounds with one of his opening tumbles, but the stage was then set for Whitlock who performed a dazzling twisting routine to take the lead.

Whitlock's routine was a cut above the rest, although Dan Keatings' crowd-pleasing performance looked to put him under pressure before it was awarded a lower score of 14.533.

That put Keatings into bronze medal position, but the medal was snatched from his grasp thanks to last gymnast Morgan, who took silver with a well-executed routine.
