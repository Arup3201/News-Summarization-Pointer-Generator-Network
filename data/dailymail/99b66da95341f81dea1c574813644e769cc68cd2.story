Alex Baptiste has been cautioned for his part in a nightclub fracas

Former Premier League footballer Alex Baptiste has been given a police caution after he was arrested outside a nightclub.

Baptiste, 28, who is on loan at Blackburn Rovers, was alleged to have hit a man who touched his wife's bottom outside UBER bar in Poulton-le-Flyde, near Blackpool.

Baptiste, who lives in Lytham, Lancashire, was given a caution for assault when he answered police bail, Lancashire police confirmed.

A 23-year-old man who was arrested at the same time will have no action taken against him.

It was reported that a man was knocked unconscious and lost several teeth in the incident, which happened at 1.35am on Saturday, June 28.

One eyewitness told the Bolton News: 'What happened was virtually under the noses of two officers.

'It was one punch but one big punch.'

UBER bar describes itself as bringing 'the ultimate in sophisticated, social atmosphere and entertainment'

Baptiste played a full season for Blackpool in the Premier League before he was sold to Bolton Wanderers. 

Wanderers then loaned the player to Rovers.

Born in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, Baptiste came up through the youth system at Mansfield Town. He was originally a central midfielder before becoming a defender.

He made his first-team debut at 17 against Barnsley in April 2003. 

A Bolton Wanderers spokesman declined to comment at the time of the incident.
