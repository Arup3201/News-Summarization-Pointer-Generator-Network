World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo will not be moving to Manchester United and the Real Madrid star has a one billion euro release clause (around £800million), according to his agent.

Ronaldo, who has been linked with a move back to Old Trafford, is 'committed to Real Madrid and it's fans' says his agent Jorge Mendes in Saturday's AS.

Mendes says the transfer is 'impossible', and that he no longer gets calls from clubs about the Portuguese star, because everyone knows he will stay with Real until he retires. 

Elsewhere in Spain the attention is on international football, with the fall-out from La Roja's defeat to Slovakia continuing to dominate.

Marca lead on 'Iker's torment' after goalkeeper Iker Casillas made mistakes for both the Slovakian goals, while AS call for David De Gea to replace the Madrid stopper.

Mundo Deportivo lead on the 'Clash of the Stars' between Neymar's Brazil and Lionel Messi's Argentina. 

The two Barca icons meet in the Superclassico de la Americas in Beijing on Saturday, in what the paper describes as 'the dream final we didn't see in the World Cup'.
