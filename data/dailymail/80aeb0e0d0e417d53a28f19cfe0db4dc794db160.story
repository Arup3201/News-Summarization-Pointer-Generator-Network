He appeared at Rotherham Magistrates' Court today charged with murdering his wife and daughter.

Redfern spoke only to confirm his name and address at the brief hearing this morning.

He was remanded in custody to appear at Sheffield Crown Court on Wednesday, August 7.

Police were called to the home the 
tree-lined road Sandygate in an upmarket area of the village, where all three had lived for around 20 years.

Residents spoke of their shock at the 
double killing at the property and described the family as private 
people and 'little unit on their own'.

Following the deaths, a family member said: 'The family of Jean and Sarah are devastated by the news of their deaths.

'Jean was a much loved sister and aunt.

'Sarah was a wonderful, kind and loving niece and cousin.

'We are at a loss to know why they 
died, but ask as a family that we are allowed to grieve and try to come 
to terms with what has happened.'

A spokesperson for Bonmarche, the Rotherham city centre shop where Sarah worked, said:

'We are deeply shocked to hear the devastating news about Sarah Redfern.

'Sarah was a valued member of the Rotherham Bonmarche store where she had worked for over nine years.

'Our thoughts are with Sarah's family and friends at this very difficult time.'

South Yorkshire Police launched the murder investigation after discovering the bodies at 7.20 pm on Monday.

Sarah was said to be 
'inseparable' from her mother.

Sandygate was cordoned off while the 
investigation continued, with scenes of crime officers seen outside the 
house.

Investigation: The women's bodies were found in a house in the town of Wath-Upon-Dearne

Police have appealed for anyone with information about the murder to come forward.

One neighbour, Helen Hughes, said: 'We
have had the detectives round but they haven’t said anything, they 
won’t tell us anything.

'I knew the family; they were very 
private people. They kept themselves to themselves. If you passed them 
you would have a chit chat about the weather and that was it.

'They were a little unit on their own.
When you spoke to them they were nice and that was it. It is very sad, I
am sorry about it. They weren’t any trouble to anyone. It’s a shame.'

Another neighbour, who did not want to
be named, said: 'We are neighbourly with them but not close. I know 
them enough to say good morning. The daughter worked at the shop where I
buy my clothes.

'They are a quiet family and Sarah was a beautiful young woman. It is a great tragedy.'

Neighbour John Clough, said the mother and daughter were ‘inseparable’ and were often seen out together.

A South Yorkshire Police spokeswoman 
said last night: 'Detectives have started a homicide investigation after
the bodies of two women were discovered at an address in 
Wath-upon-Dearne.

'A local man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is assisting police with enquiries.'

shooting should phone South Yorkshire Police on 101 or Crimestoppers 
anonymously on 0800 555 111.
