Al Qaeda has issued a new threat to carry out 'earth-shattering, shocking and terrifying' attacks on the U.S. and Europe, it emerged today.

In a posting on a jihadist website, the terror group said the 'coming strikes' would target the 'heart of the land of non-belief' as well as countries aiding France in its crackdown on rebels in Mali.

The unidentified writer claimed the attacks would be 'group and lone-wolf operations, in addition to the use of booby-trapped vehicles'.

U.S. officials say they are taking the threat seriously.

'Targeting heart of land of non-belief': Al Qaeda has issued a new threat to carry out terrorist attacks on the U.S. and Europe in a posting on the Arabic version of this jihadist website, Ansar Al-Mujahideen

The message, posted on the Ansar al Mujahideen network on Sunday, carried the headline: 'Map of Al Qaeda and its future strikes'.

It says: 'Where will the next strike by al Qaeda be?

'The answer for it, in short: The coming strikes by al Qaeda, with Godâ€™s Might, will be in the heart of the land of nonbelief, America, and in France, Denmark, other countries in Europe, in the countries that helped and are helping France, and in other places that shall be named by al Qaeda at other times.'

The message, translated by The Washington Times, says the attacks will be 'strong, serious, alarming, earth-shattering, shocking and terrifying.'

All attacks would be recorded and published, it added.

New threat: The message warned France and it allies that they faced a 'long war of attrition' in the battle with Al Qaeda insurgents in Mali (above)

It goes on to warn France and those supporting its assault on Al Qaeda insurgents in Mali that they are facing a 'long war of attrition'.

The threat emerged as French troops announced yesterday they had overtaken a rebel-held airport in Kidal, northern Mali, as they begin the completion of the first phase of the military operation in the African nation.

Kidal was the last urban stronghold held by the Islamist insurgents who have been in control of the greater part of northern Mali for the past ten months.

France has deployed some 4,500 troops in a three-week ground and air offensive, being suported by Britain and other European forces, aimed at heading off the risk of Mali being used as a springboard for jihadist attacks in the wider region or Europe.

Growing force in Africa: The moment Al Qaeda stormed a gas plant in Algeria earlier this month in a hostage crisis that led to the death of 37 foreign workers

The Ansar al-Mujahideen network has 
published reliably accurate propaganda messages from Al Qaeda and its 
affiliates in the past.

U.S. counter-terrorism has prevented major attacks by Al Qaeda over the last ten years.

The efforts also tracked down the terror group's founder, Osama bin Laden, who was shot and killed by special forces inside a residential compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in May, 2011.

But officials warn the group continues to be dangerous, as was shown earlier this month when Al Qaeda gunmen stormed a gas plant in Algeria in a hostage crisis that led to the death of 37 foreign workers.

Some
29 of the hostage-takers also died, while three were captured by Algerian 
troops during a special forces mission to end the four-day stand-off which had been carried out in revenge for the Mali operation.

The attack has led to renewed fears the terror network is growing in strength in North Africa.
