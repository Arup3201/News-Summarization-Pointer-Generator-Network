West Ham have revived their bid to sign Antonio Rudiger from Stuttgart.

The 21-year-old centre-back has also attracted interest from Newcastle but Stuttgart director of football Fredi Bobic says he will cost £7m.

He said: ‘Our aim is to make sure he stays and continues playing for us next season.’

Wanted: West Ham are chasing Stuttgart defender Antonio Rudiger

Injured: Andy Carroll is ruled out for four months after damaging his ankle

West Ham are also continuing to look for a striker also but strain exists between manager Sam Allardyce and the club’s owners.

The club are hoping to strengthen the area following the injury to Andy Carroll which ruled him out for four months.
