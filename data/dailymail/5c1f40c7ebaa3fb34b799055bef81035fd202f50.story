A Lamborghini owner who was forced to abandon his £250,000 supercar on Tower Bridge after running out of petrol was arrested by police who came to his aid. 

When police arrived to assist the stranded motorist, they discovered that he was wanted on suspicion of harassment and taken into custody. 

The Italian sports car was left on Tower Bridge overnight until it was towed away earlier today.

When City of London officers attended the scene, they discovered that the man was wanted by the Metropolitan Police on an outstanding harassment warrant. 

The man has been bailed pending further enquiries. 

However, officers investigating the case have discovered that the vehicle may have been driving on the number plate of a different vehicle.

According to DVLA records, the personalised numberplate on the 1980s supercar belong to a Range Rover V8.

The driver told officers that he is in the process of changing over the plates onto his Lamborghini.  

The white Lamborghini Countach was left on the bridge overnight and prompted Transport for London to post an image of the car after it began to cause problems for morning rush hour traffic.

Staff wrote: ‘Tower Bridge N/B there’s a lane blocked due to an abandoned car…Anyone missing theirs?’

Metropolitan Police said the two door V12 Italian supercar, which was in production until the 1990s, remains on the bridge and ‘is not causing an obstruction’.

A spokesman from the force said: ‘Police were made aware of a white Lamborghini car stationary on Tower Bridge.

Police say the car remains on the bridge and 'is not causing an obstruction' to traffic. But Transport for London tweeted this morning to say that the vehicle was blocking one lane

‘The car had run out of petrol on the bridge at 6.30pm last night – October 8.

‘City of London police attended and discovered the driver was wanted on warrant for harassment - he was arrested and taken to an east London police station where he was passed into the custody of the Metropolitan Police. He remains in custody.

The mid-engined supercar was produced by Lamborghini between 1972 and 1990.

2,042 of the two-door coupes were made.

The LP 500S model can reach top speeds of 160mph while the LP 500 Turbo S Prototype can reach 207mph.

The engine is pointed 'backwards', the output shaft is at the front, and the gearbox is in front of the engine for better weight distribution.

Designed by Marcello Gandini, the supercar came third on the list of top sports cars of the 70s and 10th in the top ones from the 80s, by  car magazine Sports Car International.

‘The vehicle remains there and is not causing an obstruction. Officers continue to monitor the situation.’ 

The Daily Telegraph reports that the driver could also face a fine after DVLA records traced the number plate and found it was registered to a black Land Rover.

The vehicle was removed from the road at around 3pm this afternoon.

A genuine 25th Anniversary Edition of the car was used in the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street. 

In one scene the main character New York stock broker Jordan Belfort, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, recklessly drives his Lamborghini Countach whilst high on drugs and crashes into his driveway.

The damage to the authentic vehicle sparked outrage from fans of the Italian supercar online, claiming that a replica should have been made.
