It's double trouble for Nike and Oakley, which have been forced to sever ties with two of their top athletic moneymakers in a matter of months after respective falls from grace.

Both companies announced this week they would drop sprinter Oscar Pistorius after the double amputee was charged with the murder of model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day.

The separation came just months since the same two athletic outfitters left the side of Lance Armstrong as his role was revealed in one of the most sophisticated doping scandals of all time.

On Monday, Nike pulled a 2007 internet ad starring Pistorius, in which he says: 'I am the bullet in the chamber.'

Spokesman KeJuan Wilkins told the Associated Press that Nike 'felt it was appropriate to take the ad down from Oscar's website recognizing the sensitivities of the situation.'

Have disgraced athletes like Pistorius and Armstrong tarnished your perception of Nike?

Also on Monday, Oakley, known for its sleek sunglasses, said in a statement: 'In light of the recent allegations, Oakley is suspending its contract with Oscar Pistorius, effective immediately.'

The California company, a unit of Italy-based Luxottica Group, has been associated with Pistorius since 2009, according to the athlete's website.

Oakley was also a major sponsor of Armstrong for 25 years - dating back to when he was a teenage triathlete - but their links to the now infamous drugs cheat fizzled in October 2012.

Nike followed suit after U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) findings showed the seven-time Tour de France winner's years of doping and use of performance-enhancing drugs.

The USADA report led to Armstrong's interview with Oprah Winfrey in January, when he finally admitted that his drug cocktails played a role in all seven of his Tour victories.

After the interview aired, Nike said in a statement: 'Due to the seemingly insurmountable evidence that Lance Armstrong participated in doping and misled Nike for more than a decade, it is with great sadness that we have terminated our contract with him.

'Nike does not condone the use of illegal performance enhancing drugs in any manner.'

Both companies, however, said they would continue to support
the cancer-fighting initiative Livestrong, which the disgraced cyclist started
in 1997.

Nike famously stood by Tiger Woods in late 2009 when he became wrapped in
one of the most notorious infidelity scandals in professional sports.

The sports retailer also rekindled its professional relationship with quarterback Michael Vick after he served eight months in jail following his dogfighting conviction and returned to the NFL.

If Pistorius is found guilty in his own trial, he will join Armstrong 
as athletes who may never race again, an extreme sign of bad luck for 
their sponsors, who dish out hundreds of millions for top-tiered talent to pitch their products.

Both Nike and Oakley did not return messages from MailOnline for comment.

The arrest of Pistorius, 26, an Olympic 
and Paralympic sprinter, stunned the millions who held him up as a hero 
for overcoming adversity to compete with able-bodied athletes at the 
highest level.

Tragic end: Reeva Steenkamp was shot dead by Pistorius, who claims that he thought she was an intruder, on Valentine's Day

Steenkamp was gunned down in Pistorius' South Africa, home in the early hours of Thursday morning.

At his bail hearing today, the detective leading the murder investigation, Hilton Botha, said that 'non-stop shouting' was heard in the home before Steenkamp was shot dead.

Pistorius, known as 'the blade runner,' was seen sobbing as Botha testified.

His defense team has disputed the findings, and argues that he thought Steenkamp was an intruder when he shot through the bathroom door.

Yesterday, Pistorius said in his sworn statement that after opening fire, he realized that Steenkamp was not in his bed.

'It filled me with horror and fear,' Pistorius said. The 26-year-old Olympian said he put on his prosthetic legs and tried to kick down the door before finally bashing it in with a cricket bat.

Inside, he found Steenkamp, slumped over. He said he lifted her bloodied body into his arms and tried to carry her downstairs to seek medical help.

But by then, it was too late. 'She died in my arms,' the athlete said.
