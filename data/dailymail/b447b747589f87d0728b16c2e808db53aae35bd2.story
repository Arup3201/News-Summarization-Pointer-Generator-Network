Busted: Jon Sandusky, son of Jerry Sandusky, was arrested in Fargo, N.D., for DUI

Cleveland Browns executive Jon Sandusky, the son of former Penn State assistant Jerry Sandusky, was arrested early Tuesday morning on suspicion of drunken driving.

Fargo police Lt. Joel Vettel told The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead that an officer spotted Jon Sandusky, 36, making an illegal turn. The officer pulled Sandusky over and decided he was driving under the influence after administering field sobriety tests.

A worker at the Cass County Jail confirmed Tuesday night that Sandusky had been booked and later released.

Sandusky is in his fourth season as Cleveland's director of player personnel after spending nine seasons with Philadelphia's personnel department. He's responsible for the evaluation of all college prospects and NFL free agents. He played safety for Penn State from 1996-99.

'We're aware of the situation and currently working to gather facts,' Browns spokesman Zak Gilbert told The Associated Press.

Jerry Sandusky, 69, a former defensive coordinator for the Nittany Lions, is serving 30 to 60 years in prison for sexually abusing 10 boys over 15 years.
