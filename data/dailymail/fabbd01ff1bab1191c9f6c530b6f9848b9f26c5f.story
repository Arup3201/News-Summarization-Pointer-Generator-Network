Prowling in the vicinity of a number of tents, this hungry polar bear is photographed just a week before it went on a ferocious rampage which left one Eton College-educated teen dead and four other Brits seriously wounded.

The images, taken by a Polish sea captain, were snapped only a few miles away from where Horatio Chapple was killed by the ravenous 39st animal, on Spitsbergen island in Norway.

The captain took the photographs as he was worried that the 14ft beast would attack the camp - similar to the one set up by the British 
Schools Exploring Society only days later.

This polar bear - thought to be the same one which killed a Brit and seriously wounded four others - is seen prowling near to a camp in Norway

A flare is shown ignited, which - on this occasion - scares the adult male polar bear away, leaving the campers safe.

Sunny Secamp, a German tour guide at the
camp, said: 'The bear came out but didn’t try to get into any tent. He 
just looked around and smelled the air.'

She said that it was possibly the same 
bear as it appeared to weigh around 200-250kg (31-39stone) - the same 
size as the bear that took Horatio’s life.

It is believed that the 
flare-triggering defence systems in place at the BSES camp were faulty, 
which allowed the animal to enter the campsite early on Friday 
morning and being its attack.

Horatio,
17, was 'ripped to pieces' by the polar bear according to Patrick 
Flinders, who was in the tent next to the aspiring doctor when bear attacked.

The
Jersey-based 16-year-old suffered a fractured skull after being bitten on his head - he punched the 
animal in the face during the attack and his father hailed him a hero 
for 'fighting for his life'.

Scott Bennell-Smith, 16, also survived, having been in the same tent as Horatio and Patrick.

In addition trip leaders Michael 
'Spike' Reid, 29, from Plymouth and Andrew Ruck, 27, who is from 
Brighton but lives in Edinburgh, were severely injured in the bear 
attack, but are now stable.

Dawyd Guzowski, who was sailing in 
northern Norway, took these astonishing pictures of the bear approaching 
the camp.

In contrast to the flares at the German campsite, 
when the bear approached the camp where Horatio was staying with nine 
other youngsters and two adult leaders, the safety tripwire failed to trigger.

It has emerged that the wire system was not fixed firmly in the ground - so it fell over 
when the bear trod on it, according to a Norwegian police investigation.

In a further mishap, the ‘old’ Mauser
hunting rifle failed to fire four times. The bear was eventually killed by Mr Reid on the fifth attempt, despite the fact that he had been severely mauled by the animal.

Safety precautions at the site have been criticised in the Norwegian media.

John Inge Karlsen, who organises 
expeditions at the University of Svalbard said that in 15 years of 
expeditions on Svalbard, members of the university had only had to shoot 
one polar bear.

‘You could say that if you come into a
situation where you have to shoot a bear, then you have done something 
wrong,’ he told the Aftenposten newspaper.

Clive Garner, head of international 
litigation at law firm Irwin Mitchell, who has experience of lawsuits 
involving wild animals attacking tourists said Horatio's family,
and injured participants on the trip, would be able to sue the BSES if 
it could be shown ‘reasonable steps’ to ensure the safety of the 
expedition.

Mr Garner said: ‘Reasonable steps need
to be taken to ensure people are safe, and while it’s too early to tell
in this case, there are serious questions that need to be answered by 
the organisers of this trip.’

The aftermath of the attack is shown - the bear appears to be dead, shot in the middle of the cluster of tents

Meanwhile yesterday Horatio's parents released an image of their killed son, after his digital camera had been returned to them by the Norwegian police.

The picture shows Horatio standing by a glacier on the Arctic island. Wearing sunglasses and smiling, he appears to be enjoying the adventure of camping in the Norwegian islands. Two days later he was mauled to death by the polar bear.
