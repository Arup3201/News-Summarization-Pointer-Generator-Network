Impassioned plea: Prince Charles at the 
Vazhachal Forest Range. He has written in Country Life of the challenges
facing farming communities

Prince Charles has issued an impassioned plea to save a  British countryside which is ‘as precious as any cathedral’.

In an editorial in Country Life magazine, written to mark his 65th birthday, the future king says the  British countryside is the ‘backbone’ of our national identity.

He also writes at length about the challenges facing farming communities, his frustration at estimates that 40 per cent of the food produced in the world goes to waste and even accuses supermarkets of exploiting small farmers.

Charles says: ‘I find it fascinating to watch how dramatically the landscape changes and how those changes affect the character of people, making the British countryside the unacknowledged backbone of our national identity.

'It is as precious as any of our great cathedrals and we erode it at our peril.’

Charles, who becomes a pensioner tomorrow, agreed to guest edit the 116-year-old magazine to mark the occasion.

He uses his editorial to talk about the importance of rural communities and the fact that they are facing some of their ‘toughest challenges’, with farmers often earning just £8,000 to £12,000 a year.

He said: ‘It concerns me greatly that the average age of a British farmer is currently 58, and that a recent survey by the Royal Agricultural Society of England suggested we will need 60,000 new farmers in the next decade. I fear it is a target we will not meet.

‘Farming, of course, is much more than just a job. It is a way of life and most farmers accept that they will not earn as much as they would elsewhere.

‘This does not mean they should be penalised for choosing such a vital profession, and yet small farmers find themselves in the iniquitous position of taking the biggest risk, often acting as the buffer for the retailer and consumer against all the economic uncertainties of producing food, but receiving the least return.

'It cannot be right that a typical hill farmer earns just £12,600, with some surviving on as little as £8,000 a year, while the big retailers and their shareholders do so much better out of the deal, having taken none of the risk. This has far-reaching consequences.

‘Such is the squeeze on farm incomes that many small and medium-sized farms, and not just in the uplands, cannot afford to make crucial long-term reinvestment, and I fear this will create huge problems in the near future, especially in the dairy sector.’

He added: ‘Farmers have taken a battering in recent years.’

Charles’s suggestion that ‘big 
retailers’ are making money on the back of hard-pressed farmers will 
undoubtedly have resonance with many.

Indeed,
it is not the first time that he has hit out at the ‘bully’ 
supermarkets for what he believes is the poor deal they give British 
farmers.

Critics, however, are sure to point out the irony of his words after Charles handed over his then loss-making Duchy of Cornwall food brand to national chain Waitrose in 2009.

The firm has added dozens of new lines and remarketed the brand, although a significant proportion of the profits still goes to charity.

The prince himself is also one of the 
largest landowners in the country through the Duchy of Cornwall, which 
has 53,154 hectares of land in 24 counties, most in the south west of 
England.

The prince also 
highlights what he sees as the huge levels of food waste that go on in 
the world, citing the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation which 
estimates that roughly 40 per cent of food produced is thrown away.

Prince Charles yesterday unwisely chose to wear suede shoes for a trip to a rain-drenched jungle during his official tour of India with his wife.

He was taken to see an ‘elephant corridor’ to learn more about work to save the dwindling Asian breed, but was left disappointed after the dozens of police officers accompanying him scared off everything but the local leeches.

‘On every other occasion in my life that I’ve gone to these things it’s the same - it’s the security that ruins everything,’ he said with undisguised irritation and mud-caked shoes.

He describes British farmers as ‘some of the best in the world’ but warns that as a nation we ‘cannot go on taking as we do from the Earth without giving something back’.

The prince also highlights the loss of rare and ancient breeds of farm animals, dismissing critics who claim he simply has ‘some sort of romantic attachment to a bygone age.’

‘My reasons are rooted in hard-nosed science and face the future. The preservation of these breeds and the characteristics in their genes could be crucial to our ability to farm sustainably,’ he says.

Farmers and farming, he concludes, are the ‘bedrock of our rural communities’.

‘This is why the countryside’s contribution to the national good has to be cherished and sustained. Without it, we will all be very much the poorer,’ he writes.

Marl Hedges, editor of Country Life magazine, said of the piece: ‘This essay reveals his unconditional passion for the British countryside and demonstrates a deep knowledge built up over many years.’
