A bride and groom didn't have much need for a dress code on their wedding invitations after filling their  guest list with 130 bridesmaids and 103 ushers.

Amy Ewing, 26, and Alex Simmons, 32, from Leeds, decided to coincide their nuptials today with a double world record attempt, which left not a dry eye at the ceremony.

The wedding is seeking to break two records; most ushers to one groom, currently 47, and most bridesmaids to one bride, currently 126.

A world record wedding has taken place at Rudding Park Hotel in Harrogate North Yorkshire. Bride and groom Amy Ewing and Alex Simmonds smashed the previous Guiness World record for Bridesmaids and Ushers by having a massive 130 Bridesmaids and 103 Ushers.

To beat the record,  Alex and charity worker Amy enlisted the help of 103 ushers and 130 bridesmaids, who all wore matching outfits. 

Their wedding planner Abbi Lewis, who runs Confetti & Lace bridal and Yorkshire Menswear in Leeds, was the one who came up with the plan.

She said: 'We wanted to come up with a crazy idea.'

'I was looking through the world records in the Guinness book and there was one for most ushers which stood at 47 in Canada in 2003.

'It seemed a low number and we thought we could beat it easily. We are hoping to smash it by well over 50. So we have 100 booked in.

'Then I thought "What about bridesmaids?" The current world record was broken in 2013 at 126 bridesmaids.

Abbi continued: 'I am one of the 130 bridesmaids. We will all be wearing the same dress. They were specially made in the US and flown over three weeks ago.

'Since then we conducted more than 90 dress fittings. 

'We had a terrible time measuring all the men's wear. All you could hear was sewing machines going at one point.'

But she revealed that all Amy and Alex were really bothered about was each other.

The couple have four children from previous relationships and are currently expecting a baby together.

Abbi said: 'They are so much in love.

'The whole wedding would have cost £110,000 but all the wedding professionals provided their services for free, including me.'

The ceremony at Rudding Park, near Harrogate, was  conducted according to Guinness Book of World Records guidelines to register it as a world beater.

Alex hosts a rugby show on Premier Sports and runs his own radio station, All Star FM.

He networked his sporting and showbiz contacts who jumped at the chance of setting a double work record.

Among their 103 ushers and 130 bridesmaids was Matthew Lewis - famous as Neville Longbottom from the Harry Potter film. 

Other ushers include England rugby's twin brothers Tom and George Burgess.
