Former US representative Anthony Weiner was spotted taking his son for a quick stroll amid claims his wife has been caught up in the Hillary Clinton email scandal.

The 50-year-old house husband was seen pushing three-year-old Jordan on the swings at a playground near to his house in downtown Manhattan yesterday.

The pair later rushed across town to get pizza.  

Former US representative Anthony Weiner was spotted taking his son for a quick stroll near his downtown Manhattan home yesterday. They were seen enjoying themselves amid claims Weiner's wife has been caught up in the Hillary Clinton email scandal

They were spotted enjoying themselves as Weiner's wife Huma Abedin faces scrutiny about using a private email account.

Abedin is one of three top Clinton aides who reportedly used email addresses hosted on the former secretary of state's private server.

Senior figures in Congress were already investigating Clinton's communications from 2009-13, which they say were not conducted via official State Department accounts but a 'clintonemail.com' address.

Clinton has handed over 55,000 pages of communications from the time - but admitted on Tuesday during a news conference that she deleted more than 30,000 emails she decided were personal in nature and unrelated to her job.

The 50-year-old house husband made sure he pushed three-year-old Jordan high on the swings before the pair ran off to get pizza

The investigation has now widened after it emerged that one of Abedin's email addresses is Huma@clintonemail.com, showing that she could have also been using the server to conduct official business. 

Daily Mail Online confirmed the address through Lexis-Nexis, a commercial service that compiles public records.

It comes nearly four years after Weiner's own scandal where he resigned from Congress for sending sexually suggestive photographs of himself via his public Twitter account to other women. 

Longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state's private server, judging from records maintained by Lexis-Nexis

Abedin (left), shown with then-Secretary of State Clinton during a 2010 diplomatic meeting in Vietnam, was her deputy chief of staff and is expected to play a key roll if Clinton runs for president

At the time he admitted that he had sent images to six women in three years and said that he had stopped. 

But in 2013 further claims were made that he sent more under the alias 'Carlos Danger' to a 22-year-old woman. 

He tried to return to politics by taking part in the 2013 New York Mayoral race but lost after receiving less than five per cent of votes.
