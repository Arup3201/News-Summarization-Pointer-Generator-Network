The weather is finally warming up - and so should your wardrobe.

The
 new Twiggy for M&S Collection lands in stores and online on 
tomorrow, featuring stylish suede, soft leather and pretty lace.

To
 celebrate its arrival, Twiggy, 64, will present the collection’s new 
pieces in London’s flagship Marble Arch store on Thursday 27 February, 
where style experts will be on hand to offer practical advice and tips 
on how best to rock the statement leather trousers or bright pink dress,
 no matter what your age, shape or size.

The Spring collection also features a suede jacket in electric blue - a big trend for S/S14.

Tailored
 jackets which can be dressed up or worn down are sure to take you right
 through the year, while a gorgeous grey parka is the perfect light 
jacket for casual wear.

Twiggy,
 born Lelsey Hornby in Neasden, north London in 1949, is regarded as the world’s first supermodel.

She made a huge impact on the fashion scene back in the sixties.

Her
 waifish figure and pixie haircut inspired a generation and, by the age 
of 17, she was a certified style icon, gracing the covers of Vogue and 
Tatler and modelling for some of the world’s top photographers, including
 David Bailey, Richard Avedon and Bert Stern.

She has been modelling for M&S since 2005 and worked closely with the retail giants designing the collection.

‘Fashion should be stylish and fun,’ she says.

‘I have worked in the fashion industry for more than four decades and have such a passion for design.

I’ve
 listened to my customers' feedback for each collection and I hope women
 of all ages will love my Spring range as much as I do.
