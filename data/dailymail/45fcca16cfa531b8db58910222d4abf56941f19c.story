Diktat: The AA said 20mph zones should only be introduced where there was clear public support for the limit

Road safety campaigners and motoring groups are at loggerheads over moves for a blanket imposition of 20mph zones in residential areas.

Campaigners urged the Government to make 20mph zones ‘the norm’ in urban areas and villages - insisting their widespread roll-out has reached a ‘tipping point’.

But the AA said it was wrong to impose 20mph limits ‘by diktat’ and that the zones - which it broadly backs - should only be introduced where they carry clear public support.

The row come as road safety group Brake today takes its ‘GO 20’ campaign to Parliament and calls on ministers and MPs to support the introduction of 20mph as the ‘default’ urban speed limit.

Brake has released new figures suggesting nearly eight out of ten (78 per cent) of people think 20mph should be the ‘default’ limit around schools, in residential streets, villages, town and city centres.

And just as many (81 per cent) think traffic travels too fast on local roads, according to the poll by Brake and Allianz Insurance.

But the AA said it strongly opposed the idea of blanket imposition of 20mph zones without the consent and support of local residents.

It supported lowering the limit from 
30mph to 20mph where local residents backed the idea - including outside
 schools, colleges and hospitals.

And
 the AA’s own poll findings showed that nearly 7 out of ten (68 per 
cent) were strongly in favour of local consultation before such lower 
limits were brought in.

Of that, some 31per cent were strongly in favour of consultation and 37per cent ‘somewhat’ in favour.

By
 contrast, only 1 in 20 (5 per cent) of those polled backed imposing 
20mph limits regardless of the feelings of local residents, said the AA.

AA president Edmund King said: ‘The message is loud and clear - residents want to be asked first before the speed limit is changed on their streets. It doesn’t mean they will say no to a 20mph speed limit, it means they want a say rather than being issued with a decree that ignores local democracy.’

The AA added: ‘We’d very concerned about it being imposed on arterial roads such as bus routes which could slow down the pace of a town or city.’

Brake said that areas where 20mph limits have been introduced have seen casualty rates fall, with Portsmouth recording a 22per cent dip in casualties and Camden in north London seeing crashes reduce by more than half (54 per cent).

Other areas where 20mph limits have been imposed include the City of London, Birmingham, Newcastle upon Tyne and Edinburgh.

Slow: It is estimated that 12.5 million people in the UK now living in areas which already have or are implementing 20mph limits

It argues that with an estimated 12.5 million people in the UK now living in areas which already have or are implementing 20mph limits, the UK is at a ‘tipping point’ at which it would make ‘social and economic sense’ to have 20mph limits as the ‘norm’ in residential areas.

Brake deputy chief executive Julie Townsend said: ‘The GO 20 campaign is about defending everyone’s right to walk and cycle freely without being endangered, whether it’s to get to work, school, the shops, or just getting out and being active.

‘We need to tackle the senseless and violent casualties that continue to happen daily on our roads, and we need to enable people to live healthy, active, social lives. It’s clear that 20mph limits in communities can help bring this about - and it’s clear this is what people want.’

A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Setting speed limits on local roads is a matter for local authorities but this government has published new guidance to make it easier for councils to introduce 20mph zones. Research shows that cutting 20mph limits on certain roads can save lives and we must do all we can to prevent road casualties.’
