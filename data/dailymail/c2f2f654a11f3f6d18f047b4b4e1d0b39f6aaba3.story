Aristocrat: James Lumley-Savile, 39, is accused of threatening his girlfriend with a pair of ten-inch kitchen knives  while high on MDMA

An Eton-educated aristocrat threatened his girlfriend with a pair of ten-inch kitchen knives in the street outside his £800,000 home while high on MDMA, a court heard today.

James Lumley-Savile, 39, the great-great-grandson of the Eighth Earl of Scarborough, is alleged to have flown into a drug fuelled rage at  Inda Pap that left witnesses fearing for her life.

Jurors at Isleworth Crown Court heard that Lumley-Savile, who is heir to the title Baron Savile, waved the blades around above his head in front of his terrified girlfriend outside his Fulham home.

A minicab driver Miss Pap called in a bid to escape told the court he thought the  businessman was 'going to kill her.'

Lumley-Savile denies two charges of possessing a bladed article and one of affray all on May 19.

Tom Nicholson, prosecuting, said the Google employee and his girlfriend were at his home when the drama unfolded.

'By the early hours, some kind of dispute had begun between them,' Mr Nicholson told the court.

'The origins of the dispute, we do not need to go into at this stage and we are not going to call Inda Pap.

'What happened was, by 2.15am a mini cab driver by the name of Qamar Walayat was called to the scene by the Uber mobile phone app.

'Miss Pap had booked the mini cab driver and was to go to her home in Bethnal Green.'

Mr Nicholson said Mr Walayat arrived at the house ten minutes later, and saw a man and a woman outside.   

He continued: 'Before the girl could speak, the defendant said: "She doesn't want the cab anymore".

'Mr Walayat enquired: "Are you going to cancel the job then?", and at that point, the girl looked over at the defendant, said she did not feel safe with him and that she wanted to go.

'As far as the minicab driver could see, she looked scared and nervous. At that point the defendant lifted both arms from where they had been down by his side to shoulder height.

'Mr Walayat could see one large kitchen knife in his right hand along with a knife sharpener, and one in his left hand.

'Both had blades of around 10 inches or so - they were proper large kitchen knives - and the defendant said in a threatening voice: "Self defence".'

Mr Nicholson said Mr Walayat had been fearful for his own safety, and that of Miss Pap, and tried to reason with Lumley-Savile. 

'Understandably, the mini cab driver felt scared and in particular for Miss Pap, who was still standing in close proximity to her boyfriend on the pavement,' he said.

'He told the defendant: "Calm down, you can talk to her tomorrow, if you do something wrong you could go behind bars," but the defendant shook his head and said 'No'.

'It seems the woman was saying words to the effect of self-defence as well.

'It will be for you to determine what that meant and whether she meant self defence to the defendant.

'Mr Walayat reversed the car around three metres away, locked the door and called the police as covertly as he could, placing it on speaker phone.

'During the call the women walked to the cab, opened the doors and got in.

'We will hear some of what she said as well. The defendant did not try to stop her.'

Miss Pap saw the driver on the phone to the police and called out 'James, James' to alert her boyfriend, causing the driver - who was 'fearing for his own safety' - to drive off.

The 999 call was played to the jury of nine women and three men.

Police spoke to Mr Walayat and Miss Pap, who were now around the corner from Lumley-Savile's home.

The court was told they noted that the pupils of Miss Pap's eyes were 'very big' and she had foam around her mouth, so decided she was under the influence of drugs.

Lumley-Savile, who was found nearby, was arrested and said: 'Will I get to tell my side of the story?'.

Interviewed at Hammersmith Police Station that afternoon, he admitted having taken MDMA.

A collection of five kitchen knives - including the two he was allegedly holding - were discovered behind his front gate, the court was told.

Mr Nicholson added: 'This does not fit easily into the terms of domestic violence.

'But the prosecution say that by going outside with two knives, frightening the taxi driver and brandishing them as he did in the area, the defendant committed these offences.'

Giving evidence, Mr Walayat, who drives an E class Mercedes, told the court he thought Lumley-Savile was going to 'kill' Miss Pap during the violence.

At the height of the drama, the rowing couple were just a foot away from his car, on the left hand passenger side.

Mr Walayat said: 'The guy told me she doesn't want the cab anymore. The tone of his voice was terrible - it was a bit scary.

'I didn't see the knife at first because it was down by his side, but the girl said she was not safe here and was talking to him and saying: 'I need to go'.

'She was obviously scared. She knew she was not safe so I thought something was wrong, and she was really scared.

'Then the guy took the knife up - it was a long knife, a kitchen knife about 10 inches long, and he was holding something that looked like a sharpener too - and said "self defence".

'I replied "Let her go".

'The body language and his voice was proper scary because of the way he was looking at his girlfriend and I thought he was going to kill her straight away because of the way he was.

'I said: "Look, let her go, you can talk to her tomorrow, if you do anything stupid you will get in trouble, let her go".

'I wanted to make him scared but he didn't listen to me.

'I didn't feel safe and I thought I might end up in hospital here so I reversed my car and put my phone on speaker and called the police.

'I held it where he couldn't see it because I didn't want him to see me and do something.'

The court heard that Miss Pap then came over to the car, and when she was '80 per cent' inside spotted what the driver was doing and shouted out to the defendant.

The driver added: 'I just put my foot down because I was not taking any risks', while Miss Pap shut the door.

In the 999 call she is heard protesting that the pair 'don't need' the police.

Miss Pap is heard saying: 'He's got knives in his hands, but I know he was like, trying to self defend himself and there wasn't anything like you know, we made it OK by me going home safe in a cab and you locked the door.

'It was a really really scary situation but I am safe now'.

The call operator, however, insists: 'There's no chance of that. We've got a male threatening you with knives, we're still going to be coming to that whether you like it or not.'

The jury were shown photographs of Lumley-Savile's home, close to the River Thames, and Mr Nicholson pointed out the footpath outside and space where the defendant parks his car.

Lumley-Savile is descended from the Earls of Halifax and Scarborough and part of one of the oldest landowning families in Yorkshire.

His father, Eton-educated businessman and war hero Hon Henry Leoline Thornhill Lumley-Savile, was injured during the battle of Monte Cassino in 1944 while a lieutenant with the Grenadier Guards.

He is set to inherit estates in Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire.

Recently Lumley-Savile sought planning permission to convert their hunting retreat, Walshaw Lodge in Hebden Bridge into a five-star twenty-bedroom hotel.

Although the family's ancestral seat in the town was sold in 2009 to pay inheritance tax, they still own almost 6,000 acres of land in the county.

The trial continues.
