David Cameron was personally assured the West Coast mainline deal was secure, weeks before the government’s humiliating admission that the franchise competition was riddled with ‘unacceptable mistakes’.

The Prime Minister intervened after a public appeal by Virgin Trains’ Sir Richard Branson, who faced losing the lucrative contract to rivals FirstGroup.

But there are growing questions about why it was not until days before a High Court challenge that civil servants realised their computer models were wrong.

Furious: David Cameron was assured by the Department for Transport that the decision to strip Virgin of the West Coast Main Line franchise was sound

In August Mr Cameron asked for checks to be made 
on the winning bid and officials at the Department for Transport 
insisted the £13bn FirstGroup bid was sound.

However, just after midnight yesterday new Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin was forced to admit that civil servants working on the West Coast contract 'failed to take into account the effect of inflation on the bids or the passenger number increases needed to make them viable'.

The revelation came ahead of a legal challenge brought by Virgin against the awarding of the contract to First.

Mr McLoughlin's predecessor Justine Greening, who was in charge when the contract was awarded, is also understood to have sought assurances.

The week before being moved to the Department for International Development, Ms Greening was told there were 'small but non-critical' errors in the contest and she ordered an investigation.

Downing Street insists the model used by officials was 'incredibly complex' and it is 'totally unrealistic to expect ministers to have grasped that level of detail'.

'We feel very let down by it all,' said a source.

However, ministers still face criticism for failing to insist on full checks being made, which could have established earlier that the model being used was wrong.

In a television interview in August, Sir Richard declared that the only ‘who can really intervene to try to get some sense into the Department for Transport is the Prime Minister’.

It is understood that Mr Cameron then asked the DfT to carry out a review of its calculations, but it returned the same response. Since then it has been established that the complex model was wrong.

Public plea: Sir Richard Branson made a direct appeal to David Cameron to intervene in the decision to award the franchise to FirstGroup

The PM is now said to be furious about the handling of the multi-billion-pound franchise bid.

A source said the revelation that the DfT had made serious errors had ‘gone down like a cup of cold sick’ in Downing Street.

The decision to cancel the bidding process would cost £40million, but most observers expect the final bill to rise to well over £100million because of potential compensation claims from FirstGroup and the costs associated with a complete overhaul of the franchise system.

Downing Street is firmly pinning the blame on civil servants. The DfT’s permanent secretary Philip Rutnam has  suspended three civil servants, two of them senior, connected with the franchise bid.

Ms Greening, and Theresa Villiers, who was rail minister before being promoted to Northern Ireland Secretary, both face criticism for failing to uncover the problems sooner.

But a government source said: 'Even the harshest critics can understand that we have to rely on the advice we get.

'This is one of those rare occasions where you have to be a management consultant-type person who understands how the 500-column spreadsheet works.'

FirstGroup was due to take over the franchise from Virgin Rail which runs services between London and Scotland from December 9.

But just after midnight on Wednesday Mr McLoughlin scrapped the deal, laying the blame ‘wholly and squarely’ on civil servants.

All change: The competition to run the West Coast Main Line, which runs from London to Scotland, has been cancelled

Today Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs Westminster's powerful Public Accounts Committee, demanded sweeping changes to the way Whitehall is run.

‘It exposes in a very stark way that the present conventions on accountability between civil servants and ministers to Parliament and the public aren't working.

‘It's yet another example ... of where the civil servants themselves have not really captured and taken on the role that is expected of them in today's society.’

She said civil servants should stay in post for longer. ‘The way you climb the greasy pole in the civil service is that you change your job every couple of years,’ she said. ‘That's a disaster.’

Former cabinet secretary Lord O'Donnell, who retired last December, admitted the West Coast fiasco ‘does raise some issues about skills in the civil service’.

He blamed ‘skills shortages’ and suggested higher salaries would need to be paid: ‘It's not that they're greedy, but pay is a measure of how much they feel they're valued.’

The Institute for Government's director Peter Riddell said the debacle 'goes to the heart of the civil service's credibility and reputation for competence’.

He added: ‘At a time when relations between some ministers and some senior civil servants are already strained, the disclosures could hardly be more damaging.’

A Q&A about the West Coast rail franchise fiasco

The Government is also under growing pressure to launch an urgent review its £32billion High Speed (HS2) rail line from London to Birmingham.

With the competence of DfT officials now in doubt, former Tory Cabinet minister Cheryl Gillan has demanded an ‘immediate review’ of the HS2 scheme while opponents say the revelation will bolster their legal challenge.

Opponents of HS2, who have long argued the business case for the line does not stack up, have seized on the revelations as proof that the DfT has got its figures wrong.

Ms Gillan, a former Welsh Secretary who left the Cabinet in last month’s reshuffle, has now written to Mr McLoughlin asking him ‘to urgently undertake a complete re-examination of the business case, a re-evaluation of the case for HS2 and the basis on which all decisions have been made by the Department for Transport and HS2 Ltd’.

Today the DfT insisted that specific flaws found in the bungled West Coast competition do not directly affect the HS2 case.

But as the blame game continues every contract and project signed off by the DfT is under scrutiny.

Joe Rukin, campaign coordinator for the Stop HS2 group, said: ‘We have been saying since the start that the passenger forecast which have been fabricated purely to support the case for HS2 are a work of pure fiction.

‘It may not be the same people who have fiddled the figures for the West Coast Mainline, but they have been using the same flawed methodologies to try and justify the case for HS2.

‘There are currently 45,000 people per day coming into Euston, but the DfT and HS2 Ltd have been saying that magically this will somehow get up to 146,000. It is and has always been pure fantasy.

‘We are confident that as the DfT prepare for the legal challenges on HS2 that they will find the same sorts of mistakes are endemic throughout the case for HS2.

'There is rapidly becoming only one option for HS2, to cancel the project as it stands, go back to the drawing board and come up with a genuine strategy for transport and infrastructure.’

A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: 'The technical flaws found in this rail franchise competition process have no bearing on the case for HS2 or the government;s commitment to continuing unprecedented levels of investment in Britain's railway network.'

Yesterday Mr McLoughlin acknowledged his department had fatally miscalculated the risk attached to the rival projects.

Mr McLoughlin said the decision to cancel the bidding process would cost £40million, but most observers expect the final bill to rise to well over £100million because of potential compensation claims from FirstGroup and the costs associated with a complete overhaul of the franchise system.
