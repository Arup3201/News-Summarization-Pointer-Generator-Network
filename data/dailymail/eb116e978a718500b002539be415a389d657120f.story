The three French police officers killed in last week's terrorist attacks have been awarded the country's highest decoration today at an emotional ceremony led by the Muslim mother of slain policeman Ahmed Merabet.

Mr Merabet was killed during the terrorist's killing spree last week when he was gunned down in the middle of the street by Said and Cherif Kouachi as he attempted to defend the staff of Charlie Hebdo.

In a moving tribute, President Hollande told hundreds of people that Mr Merabet, Franck Brinsolaro and Clarissa Jean-Philippe 'died so that we could live free'.

The coffins of the three slain officers - who were posthumously awarded the country's highest honour - were carried at a solemn funeral ceremony attended by the president.

Mr Merabet, a 40-year-old Muslim, was executed by the killers as he lay injured on a Paris sidewalk as they fled Charlie Hebdo's offices.

Mr Brinsolaro, 49, was providing security for the editor of the Charlie Hebdo newspaper, and Ms Jean-Philippe, 27, was shot dead the day after the massacre.

The Marseillaise anthem rang out under grey skies as a grim-faced Hollande pinned the country's highest decoration, the Legion d'honneur, onto coffins draped in the red, white and blue flag, surrounded by weeping families and uniformed colleagues.

Established by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1801, the Order is the highest award in France.

Chopin's funeral march was played as the coffins, draped in French flags, were carried from the building.

'Our great and beautiful France will never break, will never yield, never bend' in the face of the Islamist threat that is 'still there, inside and outside' the country, said Hollande.

Flanked by hundreds of officers at police headquarters in central Paris, he told the crowd: 'They died so that we could live free.'

He vowed that France will be 'merciless in the face of anti-Semitic, anti-Muslims acts, and unrelenting against those who defend and carry out terrorism, notably the jihadists who go to Iraq and Syria'.

At the ceremony in the capital, Hollande went first to the family of Mr Merabet, the French Muslim policeman killed in the attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo.

The country has been shaken to its core by the bloodshed that began with a jihadist assault on the satirical Charlie Hebdo magazine on Wednesday and ended in a bloody hostage drama at a Jewish supermarket two days later.

The satirical newspaper lampooned religions and had been threatened repeatedly for its caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed. Seventeen people were killed in the attacks, along with the gunmen.

Meanwhile, the four Jewish kosher deli victims were today laid to rest at a funeral in Israel, where, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for Jews to emigrate to Israel for their own safety amid rising anti-Semitism. 

Thousands of mourners streamed towards the cemetery at Givat Ha Shaul, situated on a hill known as 'the Mount of Repose' in Jerusalem, as helicopters and surveillance balloons circled overhead.

At the funeral, relatives of the victims each spoke briefly and lit a torch in memory of their loved ones before stepping off the stage with a huge Israeli flag in the background to embrace Israel's president, prime minister and his wife.

Mr Netanyahu said world leaders were beginning to understand the threat of extremist Islam.

'I think that most (world leaders) understand - or are at least starting to understand - that this terror committed by extremist Islam represents a clear and present threat to peace in the world in which we live,' he told the ceremony.
