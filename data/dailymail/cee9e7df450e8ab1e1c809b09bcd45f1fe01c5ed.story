A 22-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of drunken driving after authorities say he crashed his car into the pedestrian walkway on the Golden Gate Bridge and got it struck there.

Bridge spokeswoman Priya David Clemens told KTVU that the driver - who has since been identified as San Francisco man Daniel Sato - left the parking lot on the Marin side of the bridge about 5.30am driving at high speeds.

He then crashed his blue Ford Mustang through some concrete and steel partitions that separate the traffic lanes from the pedestrian walkway and bike path.

However once inside the walkway, he just kept driving.

A bit stuck: An alleged drunk driver wedged his car into this tight space on the Golden Gate Bridge Tuesday morning after driving along the pedestrian walkway

Smash: The 22-year-old driver crashed through steel and concrete barriers to get into the walkway

Not a road: Police say the young man treated the pedestrian path as a traffic lane and kept driving

Traffic: The incident caused major disruptions to the bridge on Tuesday morning as bridge workers tried to remove the car

Arrested: Daniel Sato, 22, was taken to hospital for minor injuries and then arrested for drunk driving

Authorities say the car traveled 400 yards before becoming tightly wedged between two barriers.  

Fortunately no one was on the bridge walkway when the wreck occurred. 

The motorist suffered minor injuries, with the car's airbags deploying after jamming into the tight space at high speeds.

He was taken to the hospital for treatment and then arrested on DUI charges. 

However the incident did not stop there.

'This driver really gave our engineers and crews some work to do today,' Clemens said.

Exit strategy: Engineers decided the easiest way to remove the vehicle was to crane it out

Local: Sato has posted many photos of his car to Facebook, including ones of it on the Golden Gate Bridge

Trouble: A Bridge spokesperson said the entire incident was caught on security cameras

The engineers had to work whether to remove part of the bridge's railing and tow the car out, or use a crane.

At about 10.45am the Mustang was craned out, according to ABC7 News.

Traffic had to be stopped in both directions as the car was removed.

The entire crash was captured on the bridge's security cameras.

However Clemens said they will not be publicly releasing the footage.
