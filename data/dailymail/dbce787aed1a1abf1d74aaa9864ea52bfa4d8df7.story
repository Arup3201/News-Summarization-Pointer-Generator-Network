Tragedy: Laurence Gunn, 32, died after being 'hurled' into the air when he was hit by Mohammed Rashid's Ford Focus in Hampstead Heath, north London

A journalist was mowed down and fatally injured on a pedestrian crossing by a short-sighted motorist who wasn’t wearing his glasses, a court heard.

Laurence Gunn, 32, died after being ‘hurled’ into the air when he was struck by 23-year-old Mohammed Rashid’s Ford Focus in Hampstead Heath, north London, as he and a friend walked their dogs, the court was told.

Mr Gunn, from Maida Vale, north west London, landed on the other side of the road and was knocked unconscious. He was taken to hospital, but died the next day from head injuries.

Rashid was unable to read a 
registration plate 25 feet away when police asked him to do so after the
fatal collision, the court heard.

Mr
Gunn, originally from Essex, had spent the day with his friend Marsha 
Peterson drinking in two pubs in Hampstead, between walking their dogs 
on the Heath, Blackfriars Crown Court was told.

He was hit as the pair headed for Hampstead Heath station along East Heath Road at around 7pm that evening.

When questioned by police at the scene, Rashid said he had not worn his glasses in over a year and didn’t know where they were.

PC Mark Apan, who questioned Rashid at
the scene, said: 'Mr Rashid told me ‘I saw a guy hit my windscreen and 
tried to swerve to the right and tried to brake.

'My
windscreen then shattered and I stopped my car and ran and called 999. 
My headlights were on but I still couldn’t see him because it was 
dark’.'

PC Apan then asked Rashid if he wears glasses, to which he replied: 'Yes, I wear glasses. I was meant to be wearing them today.

'I haven’t worn the glasses for about one year and have not had an eye test for two years. I am meant to wear glasses, but I don’t know where they are.'

Officers
then gave Rashid a ‘not particularly scientific’ eye test at the scene,
but he could only read the license plate on the car just 7ft away.

His name also flashed up on a police database search as someone who should wear glasses when driving, the jury were told.

PC
Apan said: 'We walked up to 25ft away from the police vehicle and I 
asked him to tell me at what point he could see the licence plate. He got 6/7ft away before making out the number plate.'

Rashid was not over the speed limit and had not been drinking, the court heard.

Mr Gunn had spent the day with his friend Marsha Peterson drinking in two pubs in Hampstead, between walking their dogs on the Heath, pictured. He was struck as they walked home

Richard Scott, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Gunn and Ms Peterson met at Hampstead Heath train station at around 1pm. They had known each other for a few months, having first met walking their dogs on the Heath.

'They started off their walk around the Heath and after a few hours stopped in a pub. Mr Gunn had a couple of glasses of wine and Ms Peterson had a pint of beer and a glass of wine.

'Afterwards they continued there walk around Hampstead Heath before stopping again at another pub. They spent the next hour or so whiling away the evening, drinking two glasses of wine each before deciding to make there way back to Hampstead Heath train station.

'Ms Peterson was behind Mr Gunn and, as he and his dog Misty get halfway across the pedestrian crossing, he is struck by Mr Rashid.

'He was hurled into the air and landed on the other side of the road. He was knocked unconscious.Mr Rashid did not stop immediately, but carried on down the road before putting his hazard lights on and stopping.

'Ms Anderson noted that while Mr Rashid was not travelling with excessive speed he didn’t make any effort to slow down at the crossing.'

He added: 'It was dark that evening, but this was a brightly lit road with a clearly marked pedestrian crossing. Mr Rashid was not travelling at excessive speed, but you may argue that would be even more reason for him to have stopped in time to avoid hitting Mr Gunn. But he didn’t.'

Police gave Rashid a ‘rudimentary’ eye test at the scene, the court heard.

Mr Scott added: 'From 25 feet away he could not read the number plate of a police car.

'The defendant was seen squinting to read the number plate. It was only when he got to seven feet away that he found that he could read the number plate.

'He was asked by the police office ‘why weren’t you wearing your glasses?’ To which he replied ‘I have not been wearing my glasses for over a year. I am meant to wear glasses, but I don’t know where they are.’

Mr Gunn was a fitness fanatic who wrote a healthy living blog, and worked as sub-editior for Incisive Media, publishers of a range of leading industry magazines.

Rashid, of Kensal Rise, north west London, denies one count of causing death by dangerous driving.

The trial continues.
