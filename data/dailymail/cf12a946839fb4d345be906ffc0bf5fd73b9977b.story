Oops! Danny Kitchen ran up a £1,700 bill playing a zombie game

For thousands of parents, it has become a familiar story. They lend their children their iPads and mobiles to play ‘free’ games.

Then days later, they receive a bill revealing the game involved all sorts of expensive add-ons, and find that their children have run up bills of hundreds or even thousands of pounds at the touch of a button.

This week, Doug Crossan, a 48-year-old father from Somerset, revealed that his 13-year-old son Cameron had incurred an astonishing £3,700 bill for games bought from Apple’s online App Store. Theirs is just the latest in a long line of similar stories, though it’s unlikely other parents have had such a draconian response as Mr Crossan and reported their child to the police.

In the past month alone, there have been three other such cases involving these underhand charges. In Bristol, eight-year-old Theo Rowland-Fry ran up a bill of nearly £1,000 on his parents’ iPad buying virtual doughnuts — some costing £69.99 — while playing the Simpsons game Tapped Out.

Then, five-year-old Danny Kitchen, who also lives with his parents in Bristol, spent £1,700 buying ammunition on ‘free’ zombie shoot-’em-up games. Danny downloaded 19 different  add-ons in just ten minutes — simply by pressing on a shopping trolley icon.

In Northwich, Cheshire, Grace Walker downloaded a My Little Pony app on her mother’s iPad — then spent £900 on virtual gems to decorate the animals. The six-year-old innocently clicked on the ‘buy now’ option which appeared on the touchscreen more than 12 times in half an hour.

In each of these three cases, Apple refunded the money lost, but only after appeals from the parents.

As these incidents grow ever more common, it is becoming increasingly important that parents become more savvy about how these games work — and how to protect themselves from falling foul of unanticipated charges.

Cases: In the past month alone, there have been three other such cases involving underhand charges incurring high costs for gaming

The problem is that many of the games or apps aimed at children are initially described as ‘free’, so parents willingly give their children their passwords so that the games can be downloaded.

But once the children start playing the games, they are offered various add-ons and extras. These might be special items or abilities for game characters — such as gems to decorate ponies or weapons for a questing medieval knight — or a ‘pass’ which allows players to skip to the next level of a game. It is easy enough for a trusting child to purchase all manner of extras without ever realising that they are spending real money.

More worrying still, is a security loophole which leaves users signed into their accounts for a full 15 minutes after they have first entered their password.

The problem is that many of the games or apps aimed at children are initially described as ¿free¿, so parents willingly give their children their passwords so that the games can be downloaded

This means that if a parent buys a relatively cheap game for, say, £1.99, and then hands their iPad to their child, that child then has a 15-minute window of opportunity to purchase whatever they want without having to re-enter the password.

These games have been dubbed ‘freemium’ — free to download, but with expensive premium enhancements. And as these games and apps have become more sophisticated, the risks of them costing parents a fortune have grown, not that the companies that make and market them are complaining.

One game that relies heavily on these add-ons is the Smurfs’ Village app — based on the popular Smurfs books and films — which encourages players to collect the ‘game currency’ of Smurfberries.

Smurfberries can be used for several different things throughout the game, such as purchasing special buildings or speeding up the time it takes to grow crops.

But these virtual berries are bought with real money: a small Smurfberry bush costs £2.99 while a wagon-load is £69.99. Both can be bought with just a tap of a finger.

Similarly, even in the highly popular Angry Birds games, which David Cameron once admitted to playing, a variety of ‘in-app’ purchases are now available to buy on a game that was once completely free.

No wonder more and more parents — who often fall back on an iPad as an electronic nanny at the busiest times of the day — are angry about the cynicism of firms that produce games marketed at children which sneakily encourage the purchase of expensive extras.

The Drager family from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, were caught out by these enticing add-ons.

In December, seven-year-old Jack Drager ran up a £1,300 bill on the family iPad in just four days after his parents downloaded the free Tap Zoo app for him.

The aim of the game is to turn a zoo which starts with just one animal into a world-class safari park.

Yet the Drager family didn’t realise that some of the add-ons, such as a trunk of coins which can be used to buy new animals, cost up to £79.99 each — and that Jack had been collecting them.

Doug Crossan, a 48-year-old father from Somerset, revealed that his 13-year-old son Cameron (pictured) had incurred an astonishing £3,700 bill for games bought from Apple¿s online App Store

His mother Heidi Drager, 32, echoes the lament of many others stung by these charges when she says: ‘It was a free download. We read the terms and conditions but I just didn’t see the warning saying there were costs involved.’

The Tiny Monsters game works along the same lines: gamers collect and create monsters to fill a virtual island. Last September, six-year-old Will Smith, of Redcar, North Yorkshire, ran up £2,000 on his grandfather’s credit card while playing the game. Without his grandfather realising, Will bought virtual food and coins costing up to £70 each time.

After legal actions in America, free games must now warn users if they offer options to buy extras — though these often appear buried in the small print of the Terms & Conditions — and a password must be entered on the first purchase that’s made.

After that first purchase, however, there is still a 15-minute window when other things can be bought without the password being re-entered — but Apple say this window can be removed by changing the game’s settings.

A spokesman said: ‘Parents can easily use our parental-control settings to restrict app downloading and turn off in-app purchasing. But it is vital parents keep their passwords safe and do not share them with  their children.’

Of course, by giving children unrestricted access to their iPads and smart phones, parents are at least partly to blame, and some will wonder why they allow young children to play with a cutting edge and expensive gadget like an iPad in the first place.

But many are simply unaware of the risks of their child accruing a huge bill, or not sufficiently tech-savvy to activate the controls on their phones and iPads which restrict such purchases.

Surely, though, the real finger of blame should be pointed at the multi-billion-pound firms whose greed allows children to throw away thousands of pounds of their parents’ money on a computer game.
