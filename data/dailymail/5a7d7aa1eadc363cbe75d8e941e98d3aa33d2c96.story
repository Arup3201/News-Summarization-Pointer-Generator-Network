The United Nations General Assembly has agreed to recognise a Palestinian state, despite the UK abstaining in the vote and fierce opposition from the United States and Israel.

The Palestinians can now take part in UN debates and potentially join bodies like the International Criminal Court.

William Hague was under pressure to back
 last night’s historic move in New York but said Britain could only 
support the resolution if the Palestinians gave a commitment to an 
immediate and unconditional return to the negotiating table with Israel.

Agreement:  The United Nations General Assembly has agreed to recognise a Palestinian state

Abstain: William Hague revealed that Britain will not back a crucial UN vote to give a Palestinian state higher status

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said this was the 'last chance to save the two-state solution' with Israel.

The resolution upgrading the Palestinians' status to a non-member observer state at the U.N. was approved by a vote of 138-9, with 41 abstentions, in the 193-member world body.

A Palestinian flag was quickly unfurled on the floor of the General Assembly, behind the Palestinian delegation.

In the West Bank city of Ramallah, hundreds crowded into the main square waved Palestinian flags and chanted ‘God is great.’

Others who had watched the vote on 
outdoor screens and television sets hugged, honked and set off fireworks
 before dancing in the streets.

Real
 independence, however, remains an elusive dream until the Palestinians 
negotiate a peace deal with the Israelis, who warned that the General 
Assembly action will only delay a lasting solution.

Israel
 still controls the West Bank, east Jerusalem and access to Gaza, and it
 accused the Palestinians of bypassing negotiations with the campaign to
 upgrade their U.N. status.

Angered diplomat: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called the United Nations' vote to recognize a Palestinian state 'unfortunate and counterproductive'

The Palestinians still face enormous limitations. 

They don't control their borders, 
airspace or trade, they have separate and competing governments in Gaza 
and the West Bank and they have no unified army or police.

Speaking last night, Mr Hague said: 'We 
continue to believe that the prospects for a swift return to 
negotiations on a two state solution - the only way to create a 
Palestinian state on the ground - would be greater today if President 
(Mahmoud) Abbas had been able to give the assurances we suggested, and 
without which we were unable to vote in favour of the resolution.

'In particular, we called on President Abbas to set out a willingness to return to negotiations without preconditions, and to signal that the Palestinians would not immediately seek action in the International Criminal Court, which would be likely to make a return to negotiations impossible.

'We sought these assurances because they
 would help create the strongest possible foundation for a return to 
talks, if combined with action by Israel and support from the 
international community, after a long and painful period for both 
parties in the absence of negotiations. This was the guiding principle 
behind our vote.'

Rejoice: Palestinian take part in a rally in the West Bank city of Ramallah. The 193-nation U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a resolution on Thursday to upgrade the Palestinian Authority's observer status at the United Nations from 'entity' to 'non-member state'

Celebrations: Palestinians hold posters depicting President Mahmoud Abbas as they celebrate on a street in Gaza City

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton rebuked the vote calling it an ‘unfortunate and counterproductive’ move that further obstructs the path to a peaceful agreement between Palestine and Israel.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the speech by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to the General Assembly shortly before the vote ‘defamatory and venomous,’ saying it was ‘full of mendacious propaganda’ against Israel.

Netanyahu called the vote meaningless.

Future: Real independence, however, remains an elusive dream until the Palestinians negotiate a peace deal with the Israelis, who warned that the General Assembly action will only delay a lasting solution

Abbas had told the General Assembly that it was ‘being asked today to issue the birth certificate of Palestine.’ Abbas said the vote is the last chance to save the two-state solution.

After the vote, Netanyahu said the U.N. move violated past agreements between Israel and the Palestinians and that Israel would act accordingly, without elaborating what steps it might take.Thursday's vote came on the same day that the U.N. General Assembly in 1947 voted to recognize a partitioned state in Palestine, with the jubilant revelers then Jews.

The Palestinians rejected that partition plan, and decades of tension and violence followed.'

Just before Thursday's vote, Israel's
 U.N. ambassador, Ron Prosor, warned the General Assembly that 'the 
Palestinians are turning their backs on peace' and that the U.N. can't 
break the 4,000-year-old bond between the people of Israel and the land 
of Israel.

The vote had been certain to succeed, with most member states sympathetic to the Palestinians.Several
 key countries, including France, this week announced they would support
 the move to elevate the Palestinians from the status of U.N. observer 
to non-member observer state

Shadow foreign secretary Douglas 
Alexander said last night: 'Labour welcomes today’s overwhelming vote 
for enhanced status for the Palestinians at the UN as an important 
non-violent, legal and diplomatic step towards a negotiated two-state 
solution.

Violence: About 160 Palestinian people were killed in the eight day offensive in Gaza that has sparked renewed international debate over Palestine's UN status

'The British 
Government’s decision to abstain is worse than a blunder. It is a 
historic misjudgment which will be interpreted as a sign not of 
influence but of irrelevance.

'The Palestinians right to a state is not a gift to be delivered but a right to be acknowledged.

'The
 Labour Party have long called for the UK government to support the 
Palestinians’ bid and it is a matter of real regret that the Government 
have so misjudged its response.

'The
 whole international community must now encourage all sides to resume 
negotiations so that meaningful progress towards a two-state solution 
can be made before it is too late.
