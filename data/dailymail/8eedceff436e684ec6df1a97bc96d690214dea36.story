Panicked: Driver Scott Tucker tried to hide from police who were pulling him over for a faulty tail light because he was wanted by officers

When Scott Tucker got behind the wheel of a car last week, he didn't have a license and was wanted by police on six warrants.

So when an officer tried to pull him over for a faulty tail light, the 39-year-old went into panic mode, allegedly leaping from the driver's seat into the back seat of the moving car in an attempt to hide.

The driverless 2003 Chevrolet Malibu careened, out-of-control, at 40mph on Main St in Maine as the front seat passenger attempted to steer while buckled into his own seat.

Police say the car nearly collided with another vehicle before it finally stopped near the Parks Road intersection about 1am as officers followed.

Richmond Police Chief Scott MacMaster told Portland Press Herald that Tucker then tried to get out of the car and flee on foot, but 'could not do so because the child safety locks were engaged'.

MacMaster said Tucker, from West Gardiner, was deeply apologetic when he eventually got out of the car.

'He said, ‘I panicked',' MacMaster said, repeating what Tucker allegedly said to him. 'I hopped into the back seat hoping you wouldn’t see me driving.'

Tucker was arrested on 
charges of operating after suspension, driving to endanger, failure to 
stop for an officer and violating conditions of release. He was also charged on six warrants out of Somerset County.

Tucker was taken to Two Bridges Regional Jail in Wiscasset, but later freed on $250 cash bail.

According to Portland Press Herald, Richmond Police Officer Chris Giles 
tried to stop Tucker’s car shortly before 1am on March 12.

Tucker allegedly continued to drive as Giles pursued him.

Giles allegedly noticed Tucker jump into the back seat when he aimed his police 
cruiser’s blue lights at Tucker's vehicle.

The front seat passenger, one of Tucker's relatives, eventually brought the car to a standstill.

But when Giles approached, the two men allegedly refused to get out of the car.

When he couldn't open the rear door to escape, Tucker allegedly continue to lie on the back seat, ignoring Giles's commands.

MacMaster said the unidentified passenger 'pulled his jacket over his head and sat there'.

Richmond
 Police Officer James Donnell arrived a short time later and helped 
Giles remove the men from the car without further incident, MacMaster 
said.

He said Tucker, who apparently got lost on his way to Gardiner from South Portland, was not intoxicated.

The passenger has not been charged.
