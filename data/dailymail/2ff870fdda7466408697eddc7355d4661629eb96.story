New PM? Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mohamed El Baradei was allegedly named interim Prime Minister of Egypt last night

Mohamed El Baradei, a former UN nuclear agency chief, is due to be named as Egypt’s interim prime minister, it was claimed last night.

The 71-year-old Nobel Peace laureate is said to have been summoned to the presidential palace yesterday afternoon to be sworn in by interim president Adli Mansour.

The pro-reform leader has long been the favourite to head a new administration.

He led the opposition to Hosni Mubarak, who was toppled by an uprising in 2011, and later to Islamist president Mohammed Morsi, who was forced out by the military last week.

Last night, the appointment was criticised by the Freedom and Justice Party, the Muslim Brotherhood’s political wing.

A spokesman said: ‘We reject this coup and all that results from it, including ElBaradei.’

The announcement came as the country braces itself for another day of violence today following a weekend of fighting which has left 35 dead and more than 1,100 injured.

Opponents of Morsi are expected to clash with his supporters when the Muslim Brotherhood stages a demonstration in Cairo’s Tahrir Square at 4pm.

It follows fierce fighting on Friday, when Islamists took to the streets to denounce Morsi’s overthrow.

The deadliest clashes were in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria, where 14 people were killed and 200 were wounded.

In central Cairo, pro- and anti-Morsi protesters fought pitched battles late into the night with stones, knives, petrol bombs and clubs.

A Coptic Christian priest was also shot dead yesterday in the coastal city of El Arish  in what is believed to be the first sectarian attack since Morsi’s overthrow.

Deaths: At least 35 people have been killed in the violent clashes between supporters and opponents of Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood

The Muslim Brotherhood has criticised Coptic Pope Tawadros, the spiritual leader of Egypt’s eight million Christians, for giving his blessing to Morsi’s removal and for attending an army announcement suspending the constitution.

Last night, Hayat Mokhles, a 50-year-old mother of three, said she was concerned about further violence.

But she added: ‘We will defend our revolution with our lives.

'These fundamentalists came close to ruining the country and that’s why Morsi had to go.’
