Burnley are set to sign Michael Kightly and Marvin Sordell on Friday as they begin implementing plans for the Premier League.

Sordell is ready to complete a £500,000 move from Bolton, while Kightly – who was on loan at Turf Moor during last season’s promotion push – will join from Stoke for £1.5million.

It will mark Sean Dyche’s first foray into the transfer market this summer, with the Clarets due back for pre-season training next week.

Impact: Kightly imporessed last season in his loan spell with Burnley and is set to complete a £1,500,000 move

Experience: Kightly has played in the Premier League with Stoke but the winger was surplus to requirements

And Sordell, speaking earlier this week, admitted he can’t wait to link-up with his old boss.

‘I worked with him a lot at Watford and he’s a very good coach, a very good mentor for players and I’m not surprised Burnley did so well last season,’ the 23-year-old said.

‘If it comes along it would be a fantastic opportunity and I have been working at St George’s Park already in pre-season to give me the best chance to hit the ground running.’

Sordell spent the whole of last season on loan at Charlton Athletic after falling out of favour with Dougie Freedman at the Reebok Stadium and was part of Team GB’s Olympic side in 2012 after a £3million move from Watford to the Trotters.

Excited: Sordell worked with Burnley boss Sean Dyche during his time at Watford

Success: Dyche led Burnley to the Premier League last season and is now building a squad to compete

Kightly was a big hit in the Championship, scoring the goal against Ipswich that confirmed Burnley’s top two spot back in April.

Dyche is also reported to be interested in signing Derby County midfielder Craig Bryson.
