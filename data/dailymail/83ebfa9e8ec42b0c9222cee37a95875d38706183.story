Nick Clegg has denied there is a rift between the Government and police after top officers rejected claims ministers were responsible for the robust crackdown which halted the riots.

The Deputy Prime Minister, on a visit to affected areas in Manchester, hailed the 'brilliant' job done by officers and insisted no-one was trying to be an 'armchair general'.

His intervention came 24 hours after police furiously declared they rather than ministers were responsible for turning the tide and regaining control of the streets.

Officers at all levels denounced 
criticism by the Prime Minister and claims by Home Secretary Theresa May
that ministers had taken charge.

They said politicians were ‘irrelevant’ 
to police decisions to increase the number of officers on patrol and 
take a tougher approach – taken long before Mr Cameron and Mrs May 
returned home from holiday.

Today, Mr Clegg insisted: 'There is no rift between the police and the Government, we fully support the police 100%. They have done a brilliant job in really difficult circumstances.

'The police themselves have said they want to review what happened and look at tactics and learn lessons.'

He added: 'These were very fast events, they were unpredictable and they were unpredicted. But nobody is sitting there as an armchair general trying to second-guess tactical decisions which the police have to take in very difficult circumstances.'

The rebellion raised fresh questions about the Government’s reform programme and cast doubt on whether it will be able to push through budget cuts of 20 per cent.

Latest polls show that seven out of ten voters do not support cuts to the police and fewer than one in three back Mr Cameron’s handling of the crisis.

In his statement to Parliament on Thursday, the Prime Minister said there were ‘simply far too few police deployed on to the streets’ and criticised the way commanders ‘treated the situation too much as a public order issue – rather than essentially one of crime’.

A day earlier Mrs May claimed she had ‘ordered that all special constables should be mobilised, all police leave should be cancelled and the robust tactics used’.

But Sir Hugh Orde, President of the Association of Chief Police Officers said: ‘The fact that politicians chose to come back is an irrelevance in terms of the tactics that were by then developing.

‘The more robust policing tactics you 
saw were not a function of political interference; they were a function 
of the numbers being available to allow the chief constables to change 
their tactics.’

Sir Hugh, a contender for the post of new Metropolitan Police Commissioner, said: ‘The vital distinction between policing and politics remains. The police service will make the tactical decisions.’

Acting Commissioner Tim Godwin made a 
pointed attack on Mr Cameron and Mrs May, saying: ‘I think after any 
event like this, people will always make comments who weren’t there. The
issue around the numbers, the issue around the tactics – they are all 
police decisions and they are all made by my police commanders and 
myself.’

He won support from London Mayor 
Boris Johnson, who made his second attack on Downing Street in the space
of a week. ‘I completely agree,’ said Mr Johnson.

‘Anyone can have 20/20 hindsight about the decisions that were taken.’ 

Derek
Barnett, president of the Police Chief Superintendents’ Association, 
said: ‘I think the public are looking for politicians to give police the
moral support that is required.’

And more criticism was heaped on the government's planned cuts from John Tully, vice chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers in the capital.

He said the 'omens are not good' that Mr Cameron will back up his tough approach towards dealing with rioters and looters with 'a new, robust attitude on the part of the Government to crime and punishment'.

'The first question mark, obviously, is their determination to keep cutting the size of the police force - a police force which has been working hard and successfully on behalf of the public putting record numbers of criminals in prison,' Mr Tully said in a statement.

'While in Opposition, Nick Clegg called for 3,000 extra police officers. As Deputy Prime Minister, he is now content to say there are sufficient officers and support the 20% cuts.

'Despite what Government politicians say, this cut to police budgets will impact on service delivery and we will see fewer officers on the streets.'

He also warned that more prisoners could be released early unless extra prison places were built and challenged the prime minister to 'guarantee' the safety of the innocent majority.

'If the Government really means what it says about protecting the innocent, it must give a guarantee now that there will in future be sufficient prison places to hold those who deserve to be in them and to keep them there. Your call, Mr Cameron,' he said.

The Prime Minister rejected calls to end the police cuts. ‘They have to live within their budgets,’ he said. But he was forced to strike a more conciliatory tone, insisting police and politicians had worked together. ‘There was a need for more on the street, there was a need to change tactics,’ he said.

‘It’s right that police took those decisions and changed those tactics, and increased the number of police officers.

‘Where I think the Government and the police worked well together was through the Cobra emergency planning committee. It helps the police by showing that there was political backing for the changes they wanted to make.’

The Home Secretary also backtracked, admitting that it was Mr Godwin who ‘came forward with new proposals to significantly increase the number of police on the streets of London’.

Last night she revealed that 16,000 police would continue to patrol the streets of London.

‘We have had some quieter nights but we are not complacent about that,’ said Mrs May. ‘The police will maintain their tough arrest policy, their presence on the streets.’

Other senior politicians struggled to contain their irritation at the police rebellion. Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, insisted it was the Prime Minister who had stamped his authority on the crisis.

And former shadow home secretary David Davis called the riots the latest in a ‘litany of disasters’ at the Met. He laid the blame with senior officers, demanding ‘real and drastic change at the top’ and adding: ‘London is suffering as a result of its failure to tackle gang culture and control the riots.’

Ed Miliband has admitted Labour is to blame for undermining the ethics of British society

Ed Miliband has admitted Labour is to blame for undermining the ethics of British society.

The Labour leader conceded yesterday that the moral decay which David Cameron has blamed for the looting occurred on Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s watch.

He admitted: ‘We did better at rebuilding the fabric of our country than the ethic of our country.’

But in his most provocative comments on the causes of the riots, Mr Miliband claimed that the mayhem of the last week was partly caused by poverty, an argument already made by his deputy Harriet Harman.

‘We have got to ask why do we have people in our society who feel that the way they can get on and the right thing to do is go and nick the telly, engage in the kind of looting we saw,’ he said. ‘We have got to avoid simplistic answers. There’s a debate some people are starting: is it culture, is it poverty and lack of opportunity? It’s probably both.’

Polls show that the public rejects claims from left-wing politicians that poverty and cuts causes lawbreaking.

One survey this week found that just 8 per cent of voters believe the Government’s cuts were to blame for the riots.

Mr Miliband said the riots showed young people have no ‘sense of right and wrong’ and sought to claim the rioters were the same as bankers. ‘It’s about irresponsibility, wherever we find it in our society.’
