Adebayo Akinfenwa showed fans it's not all hard work and no play being football's strongest man.

The AFC Wimbledon striker, known as Beast Mode by fans, took to the town to celebrate a friend's birthday over the weekend and was only too happy to foot the bill.

He took to Instagram to post the picture of his weekend antics, but it is not known whether Akinfenwa relaxed his strict diet and training regime to have a few drinks himself.

Akinfenwa has certainly had an enjoyable week, with the big man putting in a memorable performance as AFC Wimbledon were narrowly defeated by Liverpool, the team he supported as a boy.

The big striker was rewarded for his hard work with a goal and the self-confessed Liverpool fan walked away from the game at the Kingsmeadow stadium with Steven Gerrard's shirt.

Unfortunately for Akinfenwa Saturday's League Two clash with Stevenage couldn't keep the good times rolling as The Dons succumbed to a 2-1 defeat.
