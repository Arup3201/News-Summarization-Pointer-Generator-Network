America pointed the finger of blame at the Syrian regime last night for the chemical weapons attack on civilians that has horrified the world.

The US State Department said Syrian rebels did not have the means to carry out an outrage on the scale seen in the Damascus suburbs on Wednesday – leaving tyrant Bashar Al Assad firmly in the dock.

Amid signs that the West is rapidly moving closer to intervention in Syria’s bloody civil war, Barack Obama ordered US intelligence agencies to ‘urgently gather’ evidence about the attack, which killed up to 1,700 civilians, many of them women and children.

A State Department spokesman said 
that, if confirmed, the use of chemical weapons by Assad’s regime would 
be ‘an outrageous and flagrant escalation’ of the conflict.

As France called for a ‘reaction of force’, London and Washington were weighing the options for responding to the massacre.

Last year President Obama said that the use of chemical weapons would be a ‘red line’ for his country.

Downing
 Street said last night that Britain would ‘look again’ at the options 
for intervention in Syria – although some Tories warned that any such 
move could make things worse. Sources said that Foreign Secretary 
William Hague and US Secretary of State John Kerry would hold talks 
overnight to discuss a co-ordinated response.

David Cameron is expected to call world leaders from his holiday in Cornwall to discuss the crisis.

Number
 10 sources insisted that there had still been no decision over whether 
Britain should arm Syria’s rebels. But a source acknowledged the 
massacre would reignite the debate about intervention.

‘The
 more attacks of this sort there are, and the bigger they are, the more 
we have to look again at the options,’ the source said.

France
 led the calls for the West to wade into the conflict. Foreign minister 
Laurent Fabius said that if there is proof of a chemical weapons attack 
by the regime ‘we need a reaction by the international community... a 
reaction of force’.

Turkey
 also stressed the need for action. ‘All red lines have been crossed but
 still the UN Security Council has not even been able to take a 
decision,’ said foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu.

Britain
 called for UN chemical weapons inspectors – already in Syria – to be 
given urgent access to the site of the deadly toxic attack.

A
 Government source said: ‘If the Assad regime really wants to 
demonstrate it had nothing to do with this, they have a UN investigation
 team 20 minutes away. The fact they are not being allowed access fuels 
concerns about what has happened.’

United Nations secretary general Ban Ki-moon also called for inspectors to be allowed in ‘without delay’.

But
 the Assad regime appeared determined to resist the calls, with Syrian 
officials warning the safety of inspectors cannot be guaranteed in areas
 that have been the scene of frequent brutal clashes since the conflict 
began in March 2011.

Russia,
 Assad’s strongest ally, also called on Syria to allow the inspectors in
 – but put the blame on rebels, claiming that victims were killed by ‘a 
homemade rocket loaded with an unidentified chemical agent’ and saying 
the attack was likely to be a provocation by opposition forces.

Former
 foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said the images of rows of dead 
children underlined the case for arming Syria’s rebels.

‘If
 it is proven – which seems likely – that this was a serious chemical 
attack then it indicates they are using weapons of mass destruction,’ he
 said. ‘That is a red line which must lead to a serious response.

‘We
 cannot allow a regime to be using WMD without a very substantial 
international response. If Russia and China continue to behave 
disgracefully by blocking action at UN level then it falls to others, 
such as the United States and us, to do what we can. As a starting point
 we now have to provide military support for the insurgents. We cannot 
sit on the sidelines and allow this to happen.’

But
 fellow Tory John Baron warned against ‘rushing to judgment’ and said 
MPs must be given a vote before any decision is taken to send weapons to
 Syria’s rebels, as atrocities had been reported on both sides.

‘The
 danger is as we get more closely involved we become more responsible 
for events on the ground and it could encourage the conflict to spill 
out beyond Syria’s borders.’
