Roy Hodgson and his doomed squad limp on to Belo Horizonte on Monday, a city which has become synonymous with World Cup embarrassment and humiliation in the lexicon of English football.

Sixty-four years ago it was a bunch of amateurs from the United States who stunned the world and jolted England from its lofty status as a global power based on the fact it had invented the game.

This time it is Costa Rica  limbering up to bring England down a further peg or two. The Central Americans top Group D having upset both teams who have won against Hodgson’s side and they are not done yet.

Paulo Wanchope, the former Derby, West Ham and Manchester City striker who is the assistant manager of Los Ticos, warned that his players are inspired to beat England despite the fact they have already qualified for the last 16.

The Costa Ricans are viewing their success in Brazil as a passport to a better league, perhaps even the Barclays Premier League, and at least a better contract, including their 61-year-old Colombian manager Jorge Luis Pinto, who is keen to move on and coach in Europe after winning titles in Peru, Costa Rica, Venezuela and Colombia.

Hodgson is planning several changes to his team, to give those players yet to feature the chance to say they have appeared in a World Cup.

Costa Rica will detect the blood of a wounded team anxious to get out of Brazil without further calamity.

‘The players want to impress the world by getting three points against a team like England,’ said Wanchope, who is among those tipped to replace Pinto if he leaves.

‘I know for sure the players want to do well and end up in the Premier League. Even though we are through and they are out, beating England would still mean a lot to our team.

‘We know that we can go far at this World Cup. We have just beaten another world champion and we need to enjoy that and then, against England, we will definitely play to win because of all that it would mean.

'We are not thinking about who we get in the last 16. It does not matter to us. We have been in a group with three champions of the world and we have shown that we can beat anyone.

‘This is unforgettable. We are part of history. Nobody would have put a single dollar on  this team qualifying, but there you go.

‘It can change football in Costa Rica. These are the best days of my career. We are very satisfied and happy with what we have achieved but we will keep working to do more.’

All over: Luis Suarez's strike for Uruguay put England on the verge of going out, before Costa Rica sealed it

Premier hopes: Arsenal's Joel Campbell scored to put Costa Rica in the lead against Uruguay in their first match

Costa Rica captain Bryan Ruiz, who scored the game’s only goal against Italy, was hounded out of Fulham last year, cheered and jeered from the pitch when he was substituted and hastily packed off on loan to PSV Eindhoven.

He has one year left on his contract at Craven Cottage but it is hard to see him  returning to Fulham following the club’s relegation to the Championship.

Having started to fulfil his huge potential on loan at Olympiacos, Arsenal’s Joel Campbell has another chance to prove to Arsene Wenger that he might worth a chance at the Emirates Stadium.

Costa Rica will not be lacking confidence or motivation when they line up against England in the iconic Mineirao Stadium, home to Cruzeiro, the reigning champions of Brazil.

It was not the same venue where Walter Winterbottom’s team were beaten 1-0 by the USA in 1950 — that was at Atletico Mineiro’s Independencia Stadium — but it is the same city and the parallels will haunt Hodgson and his team if they do not get out of Belo Horizonte without a point, at the very least.

England have never left a World Cup finals without a point.
