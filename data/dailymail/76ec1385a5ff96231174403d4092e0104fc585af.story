She may have been left distraught on Wednesday when she narrowly missed out on seeing her daughter Kiki in the jungle, but it was a better day for Charlie Brooks on Thursday night's show.

The EastEnders actress won a phone call to her daughter as a result of a darts game they played.

And she was so overwhelmed she gushed at her campmates afterwards, thanking them for letting her take the one call granted to the four of them.

Delighted: Just a day after Charlie Brooks was left disappointed at not 
getting to see her daughter Kiki in the jungle, she won a phone call 
from her in camp

The celebrities took part in a game in which their dart throwing skills could win 21 treats - two of which were phone calls to friends or family.

The aim of the game was to fire a dart to the corresponding number picked out of a bag and the celebrity would get whatever treat was beside that number written on a board, all played in a relay style.

Charlie said as she learned about the new challenge: 'It was really handy that we had a darts challenge and we had Eric Bristow, although his track record through the show hasn’t been very good.'

That smile says it all: The EastEnders actress was selected by her camp mates to use up the one phone call to make up for her disappointment the day before

Eric was first up and pulled number 10, he hit double ten with the first arrow which won them one beer. Next up was David who managed to hit number 14 on his fourth dart winning some Cheddar cheese.

Ashley hit number one and won a phone call from home, Charlie missed the board completely but then it was Eric’s turn again and he hit number nine with his first dart and won coffee. Meanwhile, David pulled number eight and hit it with his first dart and won coffee and sugar.  

Agreeing that the two phone calls should be combined to make a four minute call, Eric said: 'Do you think Charlie should have it as David spoke to his mum and I don’t give a s**t?' The others agreed 100 per cent with him and a thrilled Charlie beamed: 'That will be amazing, thank you guys.'

Overcome: The camp mates had won the chance for two different two minute calls but let Charlie speak to her daughter for the full four minutes

Thank you! She gushed to Ashley, David and Eric after squealing down the phone for the duration

The celebrities had their winnings from the darts challenge delivered, it was cheese, a beer, coffee and sugar.

They were tucking into the cheese when the phone in camp rang and Charlie spoke to her daughter Kiki.

Squealing with delight Charlie was so excited to hear from Kiki as the youngster screamed down the phone: 'I miss you mummy, you are doing really well, you have lost a lot of weight, I’ve been watching and I can’t tell you how proud I am of you.'

Charlie told her how much she loved her and that her handwriting in the letter she sent to camp was really good.

Can he do it? The camp mates joined in together on a group challenge which saw them try to hit different treats on a board to win them

'I know you so well and you are a strong woman why didn’t you say we are a strong, independent, motivational, inspirational women?'

Charlie answered: 'Because we are strong, independent, motivational, inspirational women and I did say it and I think of you every time. I love you, you are the best, I can’t wait for snuggles and I’m going to snuggle you so much.'

Kiki replied: 'You are the best mummy, you will win it now, I want to be the princess of the jungle! I love you!'

Having a go: Charlie also took part to win the remaining four some treats to take back to camp on one of their final evenings

Charlie said: 'You will be princess of the jungle no matter what. Do you know what the Chelsea score is, don’t worry I know you can’t tell me. I love you, love you, love to everyone.'

After the call Charlie thanked everyone for letting her take the call and jumped up and down and clapped with glee.

It was just a day after show producers infuriated viewers by getting Kiki's hopes up by telling her she could get to see her mum for a cuddle.

Contestants on I’m A Celebrity at least have plenty of warning of the emotional turmoil the challenges of the jungle are likely to present.

But the ITV show reached disturbing new lows when a seven-year-old girl was the one left in distress.

Producers were accused of cruelty after the child was put up as a prize – and had to be consoled when her mother failed to ‘win’ her.

Distraught: Charlie Brooks was devastated to learn that she was inches away from her daughter 24 hours earlier

So close: Charlie's daughter was disappointed that she missed out on seeing her mother

Hundreds of viewers took to social 
networking sites and internet discussion forums yesterday to complain 
about the treatment of Kiki, the daughter of jungle competitor and 
former EastEnders actress Charlie Brooks.

Miss Brooks had been paired with a 
fellow contestant, darts champion Eric Bristow, and given the 
opportunity to win luxuries by choosing one of five doors to open.

They did not know that behind the 
doors the prizes included food, clean clothes – and various members of 
their friends and family. Kiki, who had been away from her mother for 18
days, was standing behind a yellow door.

The youngster could hear her mother’s 
voice and was heartbroken when Miss Brooks and Mr Bristow picked the 
wrong colour to reveal a sign which said ‘game over’.

Millions of 
viewers saw Kiki’s distress as she realised she would not see her mother
and had to be consoled by one of Mr Bristow’s sons, who was next to 
her.

Tough blow: Charlie described learning that her daughter could have been so close was like being 'kicked in the gut'

Pulling at the heartstrings: Charlie was left in tears at the thought of her daughter being so close

It was only after learning that two 
fellow contestants had got to see their loved ones that Miss Brooks, 31,
realised she had missed the opportunity to see her daughter.

She was left distraught and  made a 
tearful apology to the cameras, saying: ‘It felt like someone had taken a
boot and kicked me in the guts.

'I didn’t even think having a member of 
family behind the  door would have been an option. This is 
heartbreaking.’

Yesterday experts and campaigners 
called on TV watchdog Ofcom to investigate the decision to involve Kiki 
in the contest, which is filmed in Australia, while others accused Miss 
Brooks of bad parenting for not leaving the jungle to comfort her 
daughter as soon as she learned what had happened.

What's behind each door: Charlie and Eric were first to have a go at the Door to Door game, she didn't know her daughter Kiki was behind the yellow door

End of the line: The pair chose the blue door and were greeted with a 'game over' sign

Margaret Morrissey, of campaign group 
Parents Outloud, said: ‘If [Charlie Brooks] was genuine about this, she 
would have got up and walked straight to her daughter and not put her 
daughter in this position again.

‘I find it staggering that [producers] have used a child in this way. To involve a seven-year-old is sinking to the bottom.’

The stunt comes just days after 
producers were accused of failing to look after comedian Brian Conley, 
51, who has battled depression and alcoholism. He left the jungle after 
becoming distressed and was admitted to hospital.

Group hug: Rosemary was seen hugging her daughter while David was delighted his mother was there to meet him

Viewers took to the internet to 
express their outrage at Kiki’s treatment. One wrote: ‘For such a small 
child to hear her mother’s voice and look so desolate when she didn’t 
get to see her isn’t sitting comfortably with me.’

Another agreed, adding: ‘ITV should 
hang their heads in shame!’ Roy Shuttleworth, a consultant in clinical 
psychology, said the game amounted to a ‘high-risk strategy’, adding: 
‘Some children would be tormented by it.’

A spokesman for the ITV show said 
permission for the girl to take part in the game had come from her 
grandmother, adding: ‘A senior producer saw Kiki afterwards and she was 
fine.  Kiki and her grandma come to the jungle every day with the other 
friends and family, so the experience wasn’t as out of the ordinary as 
it might look.’

An agent for Miss Brooks refused to comment on why Kiki was not at school.
