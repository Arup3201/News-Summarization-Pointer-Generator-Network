Their motives were lofty, their methods inventive and their vessel... as buoyant as their spirits.

As a plan, however, crossing the Solent in a bouncy castle never exactly had success written all over it.

These soldiers set themselves the challenge to paddle the mile from Hurst Castle, Hampshire, to Colwell Bay on the Isle of Wight in the Bantman-themed inflatable in aid of Help for Heroes.

The intentions were there: Soldiers had to be rescued after their attempt to paddle across the Solent in a bouncy castle failed

To keep the vessel - aptly-named HMS 
Implausible - inflated, the group strapped petrol-fuelled leafblowers to
her makeshift deck.

Unsurprisingly, trouble struck.

A simple error over tide times saw  Captain Andy Ellis, Captain Terry Williams and Major Matt Smith being swept quickly towards the Needles and open sea, before a support boat had to tow them back to safety.

The soldiers had planned to mount their challenge at high water when currents would be weakest.

In order to keep it afloat the group had strapped the leafblowers to their makeshift deck.

But they didn't launch until an hour later, by which point the tide was rushing in a westerly direction towards the Needles.

Despite the failed attempt the soldiers refused to be deflated and told spectators they were already planning another attempt.

Mike Cunningham said: 'From the moment the soldiers got to the beach it was clear it was never going to work.

'The soldiers decided to launch the bouncy castle way down the beach and tow it up to the starting point with their support boat but it broke down.

'They then had to drag the fully inflated bouncy castle all the way up the shingle spit.

'By the time they got to the end they had completely missed the slack tide, so despite a strong start it wasn't long before they were flying towards the Needles.

'In the end they had to be rescued by their support boat and they ended up being towed back to the beach.

'If it hadn't been for the rescue who knows where they would be now.

'They did say they were going to have another go so let's hope they plan it better next time.'

Another bewildered onlooker said: 'They had clearly gone to a lot of bother to prepare the bouncy castle for sea, but it was just never going to work.

'They would have been better off putting the leaf blowers in the water and blasting themselves across.

'You wouldn't want to be in their tank, that's for sure. It might make sense to leave these sorts of ventures to the navy.'
