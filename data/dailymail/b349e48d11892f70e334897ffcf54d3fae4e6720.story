The mother of missing chef Claudia Lawrence has revealed she has nightmares and still lives 'hour by hour' five years after her daughter vanished on the way to work.

Joan Lawrence, 70, spoke as the first person to be arrested in the investigation, 59-year-old Michael Snelling, was released on police bail without charge.

In an emotional interview, she said learning of the arrest plunged her into a 'dark hole' but she was 
trying desperately to continue with normal life.

Her words come as forensic
 officers with sniffer dogs continue to comb Mr Snelling's home in York and 
his mother's home in North Shields, North Tyneside. They said the searches will continue for a number of days.

Anguish: Joan Lawrence, pictured right with her daughter Claudia before she went missing five years ago, said she felt like she had been 'plunged into a dark hole' with news of the first arrest so far in the case

She told Peter Barron, editor of the Northern Echo in her home town of Darlington, County Durham: 'I just felt I'd been plunged into a dark hole with news of the arrest. After more than five years, it didn't seem real.

'I have nightmares, wondering what Claudia might have gone through. Had she been calling for me? I just don’t know.... All you can do is live hour by hour, day by day and keep on hoping.'

But when she saw Mr Snelling's face on the news, she said he did not 'look like someone capable of doing anything.'

'I want justice but I don't want anyone's life to be wrecked,' she said. 'This man may be totally innocent.'

Former lab technician and charity 
worker Mr Snelling was released on police bail last night after being 
questioned on suspicion of murder.

The arrest was the first of anyone on 
suspicion of causing harm to York University chef Miss Lawrence, who was
 35 when she disappeared in March 2009.

He
 worked at the same university as Miss Lawrence and drank in her local 
pub. Yesterday family members sprang to his defence, saying police were 
'barking up the wrong tree'.

Cousin
 Gordon Kewley, of North Shields, Tyneside, said: ‘He is the best of 
sons. I was shocked when I found out, I couldn’t believe it. He is a 
lovely bloke and an academic who used to work at the university.’

Evidence: Crime scene investigators could be seen with bags of items at the home of Mr Snelling

MARCH 19 2009

6am: Miss Lawrence fails to arrive for her shift at Goodricke College.

Daytime: At some point, her mobile phone is either switched off or runs out of battery.

Evening:
 Miss Lawrence fails to meet her friend Suzy Cooper. After finding out 
Miss Lawrence also did not turn up for work, Ms Cooper calls Mr 
Lawrence, who then calls North Yorkshire Police.

Night: The police search for Miss Lawrence begins.

A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said last night: 'Forensic searches at relevant properties are expected to continue for a number of days.

'Every effort will be made to minimise disruption to local residents and the public affected by this work. North Yorkshire Police would like to thank those people for their patience and understanding.

'As investigations continue with the possibility of further arrests to be made, all sections of the community and the media are reminded and encouraged to respect the rights of others, including those connected to the case.

'It is also important that the investigation team have every opportunity to follow due legal process.'

Neighbours said Mr Snelling worked for
 some time as a lab technician in the biology department at York 
University but recently started work for a mental health charity.

His York house is about half a mile from the small house in the Heworth area where Miss Lawrence lived alone.

Miss Lawrence was reported missing by her father Peter on March 20, 2009.

She was last seen at around 3.05pm on 
March 18, walking back towards her home, and that night she spoke to 
both her parents on the phone.

It is thought something happened to her after she left for work early on March 19.

North
 Yorkshire Police, who have always said they believe Miss Lawrence was 
murdered, launched a review of the investigation last year after a new 
major crime unit was established by the force.

Last year, the new investigation team conducted a detailed, two month re-examination of Miss Lawrence’s home.

Then,
 in March this year, senior officers announced a series of new lines of 
inquiry on the fifth anniversary of the day she failed to turn up for 
work.

Investigation: Police said searches of Mr Snelling's home in York (pictured) and his mother's home in North Shields, North Tyneside, will continue for a number of days. He has been released on police bail without charge

Second home: A forensic officer with a sniffer dog enters a North Shields home, one of two houses 100 miles apart being searched by police. The home belonged to Mr Snelling's mother and he visited her often

Arrival: Police search teams arrive at a home in York, thought to belong to Mr Snelling, this morning

On the scene: A line of officers in masks and rubber gloves attend the North Shields house

The announcement coincided with a fresh appeal on the BBC’s Crimewatch.

They said the new forensic examination of her house uncovered the fingerprints of people who had not yet come forward.

Using
 techniques not available in 2009, they found a potentially vital 
DNA profile on a discarded Embassy Regal cigarette butt in her Vauxhall Corsa.

Police have said before that Miss Lawrence’s mobile and rucksack have never been found.

Clues: A 'left-handed smoker' was seen on a bridge with a woman on the morning Miss Lawrence vanished, and has never been found. Pictured: A previous reconstruction by the BBC's Crimewatch
