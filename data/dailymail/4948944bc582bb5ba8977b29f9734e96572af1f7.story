A mother has beaten incredible odds to give birth to the third consecutive generation of twins in her family.

Stephanie Procter, 33, of Newmarket in Suffolk, is 'inseparable' from her twin sister Gina Breakenbury and desperately wanted twins herself so they could share the same special bond.

She fell pregnant with twins with her husband Danny, 32, a mechanical engineer, but suffered a miscarriage. Then incredibly, she conceived a second set.

Three generations of twins in the same family, (left to right) Marianne Flack, Marianne's daughter Stephannie Procter with her twin babies Honey and Amalie, Stephanie's twin Gina Breakenbury, and Marianne's twin Valerie Taylor.

Identical siblings Honey and Amalie were born just three minutes apart and are now being doted on by their extended family.

Proud Stephanie - whose mum Marianne Flack, 61, has a twin sister Valerie Taylor - said: 'It’s been hard work but it’s a dream come true for me.

'Growing up with a twin made me really want to have twin girls.

When I lost twins I thought I’d had my chance and that would be it. So when I found out I was having twins again at my 12-week scan I was delighted.'

Even before the scan Stephanie says she had an inkling. 'I told my twin sister I thought I was carrying twins,' she said.

'I didn’t want to tell anyone else in case I was wrong, but I’m so glad I was right.'

The twins were born on July 2 at 11.11am, with Honey arriving first, weighing 4lbs 15oz and Amelia three minutes later at 3lbs 15oz.

However, their early days of life were fraught with worry as Honey had an underdeveloped stomach and was taken to the Rosie, a neo-natal unit at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge. The twins were separated for 12 days.

Stephanie, who is a planning coordinator for a packaging company, said, 'We thought Honey was going to need an operation but luckily in the end she didn’t.'

Now nine weeks old, the twins are back at home. Stephanie’s mum Marianne and her husband Danny are taking it in turns to help out.

The three generations of twins all live within five miles of each other and the family are very close.

Stephanie explains: 'All the twins in the family are natural so it’s very rare. Three sets of twins in one family is just amazing.

'It’s hectic when we all get together. The poor husbands, bless them, they hardly get a word in edgeways.'

Stephanie's twin, mother-of-two Gina, who works as a commercial analyst, said: 'I loved growing up as a twin and I’m so pleased that Stephanie had her own set of twins because they’ll be exactly the same.

'It’s just brilliant. She’s my best friend as well as my sister.

'We did everything together, netball, clubbing, going on holiday. I’ve never felt alone in my life because I’ve always had Steph - and her kids will be the same.

'Maybe they’ll be even closer because they’re identical.'

Knowing how much hard work twins can be, Stephanie’s mum took some time off work to help out.

Proud grandmother Marianne, who works as a labour and delivery domestic at RAF Lakenheath, said: 'I thought it was marvellous when I found out and I was excited for her but, knowing what I know, I thought it would be hard work for the first year.

'Then it’s very rewarding after that. They play together - they’re much better together than bringing them up on their own.

'They were never sad, they were always happy and that’s how me and my twin are. We do everything together and we always have.'

Marianne has been married to her husband Stephen, 67, a retired construction worker, for 43 years.She added: 'I’ve got my twin who’s my best friend.

'It’s just wonderful. There’s me and my sister and then my daughters and now my granddaughters. They’re going to have fun together.'

Marianne's twin, Valerie, a cleaner, said: 'We’re a close family anyway but with twins it’s very special.'

William Hill said the odds of three successive generations of twins within one family is 20,000 to 1.
