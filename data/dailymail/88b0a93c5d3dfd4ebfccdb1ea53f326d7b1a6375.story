Facebook has been ordered to remove a page which monitors paedophiles following a legal challenge by a convicted sex offender.

High Court judge Mr Justice McCloskey found that the man, whose identity cannot be revealed, had his human rights breached.

The judge sitting in Northern Ireland has given Facebook 72 hours to take the page down.

Judgement: Facebook is considering its next move after a Northern Ireland court ordered the removal of a page monitoring paedophiles

A spokeswoman for Facebook said: 'We are considering our next steps in light of the court judgment and we have nothing further to add at this stage.'

The man, known only as XY, started legal proceedings against the social networking site after discovering his photograph and threatening comments were posted on the page.

More than 5,000 people have liked the page entitled ‘Keeping our kids safe from predators’.

Some of the latest posts were written after Lord Justice McCloskey made his ruling.

Another wrote: 'Let down a bag full :( no justice at all......Not only me but every victim of sex abuse every kid in the land....... This is what we get for trying 2 protect our kids.'

Facebook is understood to have removed the man’s photo and comments made about him but his legal team insisted that the page should be shut down.

This evening it appears the page has already disappeared from the social networking site.
