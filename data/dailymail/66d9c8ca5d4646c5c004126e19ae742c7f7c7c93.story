The British government has started negotiations to compensate thousands of Kenyans who claim they were subjected to appalling abuse by colonial authorities during the 1950s' Mau Mau uprising.

The historic talks could mark the first compensation settlement resulting from official crimes committed under imperial rule, at a cost of millions of pounds to taxpayers.

It could also lead to claims from other former colonies, such as British Guiana (now Guyana) in South America, and Swaziland in southern Africa.

The Foreign Office (FCO) had originally said the Kenyan government was legally responsible for any mistreatment as all liabilities were transferred to the Kenyan Republic when it formed in 1963 as Britain pulled out of Africa.

But attempts by government lawyers to prevent elderly survivors of prison camps having their cases heard in British courts were scuppered after the discovery in 2011 of a huge archive of colonial documents which the FCO had kept hidden for decades.

Among the 8,000 documents - located at a repository in Hanslope Park, Buckinghamshire - are accounts, written by colonial officials, of prisoners being 'roasted alive'.

Removed from Kenya on the cusp of independence, the paperwork was uncovered in January of that year after five Kenyans launched a lawsuit against the British government.

The claimants said they suffered castration, sexual abuse and severe beatings in detention camps administered by the British government and wanted an apology and financial compensation.

The secret papers revealed that during the Mau Mau rebellion - which saw tens of thousands die between 1952-60 - senior colonial officials authorised 
appalling mistreatment of inmates held at the prison camps.

The documents also show that officials in London knew about the brutal actions of the detention regime.

As details of the talks began to 
emerge last week, the FCO said it accepted the 
need to discuss Britain's past role.

'It is an enduring 
feature of our democracy that we are willing to learn from our history,' an FCO spokesman told the Guardian.

As many as 10,000 former prisoners could receive compensation.

Although 
the individual amounts will vary greatly, the total compensation is 
likely to run into tens of millions of pounds.

The FCO said that it 
would be 'inappropriate' to discuss the talks.

But in a prepared statement, it added: 'We understand the pain and grievance felt by those, 
on all sides, who were involved in the divisive and bloody events of the
Emergency period in Kenya.

'It is right that those who feel they have a 
case are free to take it to the courts.

'Our relationship with Kenya 
and its people has moved on and is characterised by close co-operation 
and partnership, building on the many positives from our shared 
history."

Among the claimants are Wambugu Wa 
Nyingi, 84, Paulo Muoka Nzili, 85, and Jane Muthoni Mara, 73,  who were 
held in detention camps during the 1950s.

Last October, the High Court rejected the
Government’s claim that too much time had elapsed for there to be a 
fair trial, with Mr Justice McCombe finding the three Kenyans had 
‘arguable cases in law’.

The Foreign Office originally said the Kenyan government was legally responsible for any mistreatment as all liabilities were transferred to the Kenyan Republic when it formed in 1963 as Britain pulled out of Africa.

They claimants said they were subjected to ‘appalling abuse’, including castration, beatings and sexual assaults.

Nyingi said he was detained on Christmas Eve 1952 and imprisoned for nine years.

He added that he was suspended by his feet and beaten unconscious in an incident in which 11 men were clubbed to death.

He also claims cold water was poured on his face to stop him breathing.

It was not until the Kenyan government lifted the ban on the Mau Mau in 2002 that survivors started to consider legal action.

And it took another six years before 
they asked the high court in London for permission to sue the British 
government for damages.

Juan Mendez, the United Nations' 
special rapporteur on torture, has called on the 
government to 'provide full redress to the victims, including fair and 
adequate compensation'.

Along with two other former rapporterurs, he wrote: 'In our view, the response of the 
British government to vulnerable and elderly victims of (acknowledged) 
British torture is shameful.'

Last month, the FCO told the 
claimants' lawyers, Leigh Day, that it wished to adjourn the appeal and 
start negotiating a settlement.
