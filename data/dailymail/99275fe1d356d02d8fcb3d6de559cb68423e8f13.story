It's a hair-raising experience that is all in a day's work for the world's best surfers: riding a 42ft wave that threatens to crash down on them at any moment.

And this is the breath-taking moment that one of the thrill-seekers narrowly avoided being crushed by a gigantic wave off the coast of Portugal, where the sport's top athletes have gathered to ride massive waves in front of hundreds of spectators.

The unidentified surfer was unscathed when he made it back to the beach at the small fishing village of Nazare, where US surfer Garrett McNamara set the world record for riding the largest wave - an astonishing 98 feet - in January 2013.

This week, the giant waves have once again lured Mr McNamara, along with the UK's Andrew Cotton, Australia's Ross Clarke Jones and France's Benjamin Sanchis.

Mr Cotton, a former plumber from Devon, said that he expected the swells to be the largest of the year at the notorious big wave spot.

Two weeks ago the fearless surfer wiped out and was engulfed by a 60ft wave as he attempted to break the world record. He escaped with a minor arm injury.

The weather forecast predicted three days of solid swells off the northwest coast, with waves as high as 41ft on the first day.

The massive swells are caused, in large part, by the region's geography. Off the Praia do Norte coastline is the biggest underwater ravine in Europe, called Nazare Canyon.

The huge canyon runs 125 miles, from out in the depths of the Atlantic Ocean to less than half a mile from the coastline.

Praia do Norte is also among one of the most westerly points in all of Europe, meaning the wind sweeps across the Atlantic unhindered

Praia do Norte is also among one of the most westerly points in all of Europe, meaning that the wind, along with the ocean swell caused by the canyon, sweeps across the Atlantic unhindered, adding even more fuel to the gigantic wave potential.

This season, Nazare seems to be taking the safety of its surfers especially seriously.

Surfers now have to operate in a rotating team of three: two jet-skies to one surfer.
