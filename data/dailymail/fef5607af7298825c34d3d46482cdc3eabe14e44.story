Love of pink: Dame Barbara Cartland died in 2000 aged 98 after several years of ill health

With a collection of more than 700 novels to her name when she died 13 years ago, Dame Barbara Cartland was renowned as one of  the world’s most prolific novelists.

But her epic collection will soon become even more expansive after it was announced that 160 of her unseen manuscripts are to be published.

Fans of Dame Barbara’s romantic tales and inevitable happy endings will be able to enjoy the previously unreleased novels in both print and digital editions.

The material – titled The Pink Collection due to the author’s love of the colour – is being released by the author’s son  Ian McCorquodale and publisher M-Y Books.

Dame Barbara, step-grandmother of Princess Diana, has already sold more than 750million novels, including classics A Dangerous Disguise and Love Drives In.

During her lifetime, she  garnered a reputation for her prodigious output – once  releasing 23 novels in a single year – but claimed that she had no interest in money.

She died in 2000 aged 98 after several years of ill health but she was writing until near the end, and still managed to release a final novel at the age of 97.

Dame Barbara enjoyed global success, seeing her books translated into 38 languages. 

And the publisher of her new work said 
that at least some of those international fans will be able to enjoy her
 latest offerings, with the books to be released in Spanish.

Jonathan Miller, managing director at M-Y
 Books, said: ‘Barbara Cartland is a unique author known worldwide for 
her pure romance writing and novels that are perfect for family reading.

‘Once again all of the titles of one of the most popular authors of all time will be available worldwide.’

Dame Barbara lived and worked since 1950 at her beloved Camfield Place, formerly the home of Beatrix Potter.

The ten-bedroom mansion is set in 400 acres of farmland and woods near Hatfield, Hertfordshire.
