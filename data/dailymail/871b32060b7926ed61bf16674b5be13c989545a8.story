Nightclub supremo and multi-millionaire political donor James Palumbo has been nominated for a peerage by Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg.

Mr Palumbo, the founder of the Ministry of Sound club in south London, has given more than £500,000 to the Lib Dems since 2004 and is expected  to be among a new list of peers announced in the next fortnight, according to the Sunday Times.

The son of property developer Lord (Peter) Palumbo, with whom he has had a long-running feud, Mr Palumbo, 50, played a key role in the last Lib Dem mayoral election by allowing the party to use the nightclub as the campaign headquarters.

The old Etonian, a former banker, is a close friend of Mr Clegg and has played a key role in helping to modernise the party by giving advice on marketing, IT, social media and personnel departments.

He has also written a number of papers on business affairs for Mr Clegg and is among party donors who have dined with the leader at Chevening, the Kent retreat he shares with foreign secretary William Hague.

Despite his allegiance to the Lib Dems. Mr Palumbo has previously given help to the Conservative party, for which his father is a peer. In 2009, he donated £7,000 in auction prizes to the Westminster North consituency association and he has admitted voting for Alan Clarke, then Tory MP for Kensington and Chelsea.

Mr Palumbo's family was torn apart 18 years ago when he and sister Annabella accused their father of plundering £30 million from the family trust, set up by their grandfather, Rudolph Palumbo, who made his fortune developing bombsites in London after World War II.

He died in 1987 leaving a series of family trusts valued at around £135 million.

Mr Palumbo told the Mail in April that he hoped he could reconcile with his father.

'There is a lot that has been said and done in the past that is hard to let go of. It has become entrenched after I wrote a letter to him.

‘But the fact is I am getting older and hopefully more mature.

'But I am not sure how my father will react to the suggestion.

‘It is not straightforward and the whole thing is difficult for others to understand.

'We are both proud men but I have been thinking maybe we could talk before my birthday.

‘Maybe we could meet over a cup of tea first. The point is, none of us is here for ever.’

Mr Palumbo could be joined by nine other Lib Dem donors in the next honours list.

It is being vetted by the appointments commission, which looks at nominees' backgrounds and business interests to ensure they do not bring the upper house into disrepute and pay full taxes in the UK.

A spokesman for Mr Palumbo said he and his businesses were fully domiciled in Britain and he paid all his taxes here.

Other names expected to be on the list are Rumi Verjee, who has given £770,000 to the Lib Dems since 2010, and Brian Paddick, the party's mayoral candidate.

It may also include party treasurer Ian Wrigglesworth and two former advisers to Mr Clegg, Olly Grender and Alison Suttie.

Further possible names include Sudhir Choudrie, whose family has donated £650,000 to the party since 2004, and policy adviser Patrick Rock.
