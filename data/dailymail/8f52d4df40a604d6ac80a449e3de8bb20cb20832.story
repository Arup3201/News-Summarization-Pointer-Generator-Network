Tyson Fury has pulled out of his fight with Alexander Ustinov after his uncle was taken ill.

Fury had been due to fight Ustinov on Saturday evening but pulled out of the heavyweight clash after his uncle and former trainer Hughie was taken to hospital on Saturday morning.

In a statement released by Queensberry Promotions, Hughie was said to be 'seriously ill' and Fury's camp therefore took the decision to 'pull him out of the fight rather than risk his health by sending him into the right with his mind not focused.' It is not clear what Hughie's condition is.

Injury: Dereck Chisora (left) pulled out of the rematch after injuring his hand

Fury had only decided to take on Ustinov earlier this week after original opponent Dereck Chisora withdrew from Saturday's date after fracturing his hand in sparring. Ironically Chisora's injury came when he was sparring Ustinov.

Warren said: 'I'm very, very, disappointed for the fans.  After Dereck Chisora pulled out because of his hand injury, we worked very hard to secure a world ranked opponent in Ustinov. 

'It's sad that his uncle Hughie is in a serious condition and our thoughts are with him. We will be announcing the rescheduled date for Chisora v Fury next week.'
