The ‘tyranny’ of capitalism is leading to widespread social unrest, the Pope warned yesterday.

In his first major teaching document, Pope Francis, 76, said inequality would inevitably lead to conflict resulting in ‘disintegration and death’.

He used his 84-page ‘apostolic exhortation’ to call for an overhaul of the financial system in Western economies that promote ‘unbridled consumerism’.

Anti-capitalism: Francis has previously expressed his disdain for Western capitalism, calling for a more ethical banking system and curbs on financial speculation

Pope Francis said: ‘As long as the 
problems of the poor are not radically resolved by rejecting the 
absolute autonomy of markets and financial speculation and by attacking 
the structural causes of inequality, no solution will be found for the 
world’s problems.’

The document, known as an apostolic exhortation, builds on views the pontiff has aired since his election in March.

Poverty and peace: Since his enthronement Francis has repeatedly called for 'a poor church'

Francis
 has previously expressed his disdain for Western capitalism, calling 
for a more ethical banking system and curbs on financial speculation.

He
 even wrote to David Cameron ahead of the G8 summit in Northern Ireland 
reminding him that money should serve mankind and rather than the 
reverse.  

Since his enthronement Francis has repeatedly called for ‘a poor church’.

He immediately ditched the traditional
 scarlet slippers and golden cross for a plain iron cross and his 
battered old black brogues from Buenos Aires.

And
 he has continued to live by example eschewing the grand Papal 
apartments for a room in a humble priest’s boarding house, travelling in
 a Ford Focus, and suspending a bishop who spent millions of euros on 
his luxurious residence.

He even chose the name Francis after the medieval saint who renounced his riches for a life of poverty.  

The document said that the inequality and injustice of capitalism would eventually lead to an explosion.

He
 wrote ‘When a society – whether local, national or global – is willing 
to leave a part of itself on the fringes, no political programmes or 
resources spent on law enforcement or surveillance systems can 
indefinitely guarantee tranquillity.

‘Without
 equal opportunities the different forms of aggression and conflict will
 find a fertile terrain for growth and eventually explode.’

Foreboding: The document said that the inequality and injustice of capitalism would eventually lead an explosion

He called for action 'beyond a simple welfare mentality' and added: 'I beg the Lord to grant us more politicians who are genuinely disturbed by the state of society, the people, the lives of the poor.'

The exhortation, presented in the pope's trademark clear and warm style, in contrast with the academic writings of his predecessor, also calls for devolution of the church, with more power for bishops to decide doctrine for their diocese.  

He reiterated earlier statements that the Church cannot ordain women or accept abortion. The male-only priesthood, he said, 'is not a question open to discussion' but women must have more influence in Church leadership.
