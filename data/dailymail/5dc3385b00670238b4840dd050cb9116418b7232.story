Newcastle's Millennium Bridge got stuck in mid-air today - leaving confused commuters unable to cross the Tyne.

The bridge, which tilts twice a day to allow boats through, got stuck about 1.30pm.

The structure, which links Newcastle and Gateshead, has never in its 15-year history become stuck before.

The Millennium Bridge in Newcastle got stuck on tilt position this afternoon following an electrical fault

Two passersby look at the bridge - suspended at a tilt. It is thought this is the first time in the structure's 15-year history that it has become stuck

The issue bamboozled pedestrians and cyclists - who had to make their way to the other end of the quayside to cross the Tyne Bridge.

David Hogg, 46 from Newcastle, was cycling to work. He relies on the bridge as part of his 18-mile commute to Sunderland.

He said: 'It is a pain. I have never actually seen this bridge open before. Now it is stuck and I can't believe it.

'It is one of very few ways to safely cross the Tyne on a bicycle. I will have to find another route now. I will probably use the swing bridge.

Gateshead Council said this afternoon the bridge become stuck due to an electrical fault

The issue - which is thought to have confused hundreds of commuters - is now resolved

'This is a real hindrance, and I will most definitely be late for work.'

Gateshead Council have said it stalled as a result of an electrical fault - but it was now fixed and was reopened again one hour ago.

A spokesperson for Gateshead Council said: 'The Gateshead Millennium Bridge has developed an electrical fault. Engineers are currently on site trying to correct it.'
