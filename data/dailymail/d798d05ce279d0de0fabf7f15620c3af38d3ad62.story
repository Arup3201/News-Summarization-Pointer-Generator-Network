Former Scotland, Everton and Chelsea footballer Pat Nevin has put a new spin on his colourful career after becoming a sought after club DJ.

The BBC football pundit is back  for a fourth stint at the Moustache Bar in Stoke Newington this weekend where revellers can expect to hear tunes from 'the likes of The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, Camera Obscura, The Fall, Belle and Sebastian and New Order,' according to the event's Facebook page.

Nevin is also a surprise name in the line-up for a retro festival headlined by the Happy Mondays and hosted by Butlins in November.

The former Blues cult hero landed the Shiiine On gig after impressing bosses with musical taste and skills behind the decks on a previous visit to the venue. 

'People know me for football but I've been on the decks for more than 30 years — music has always been my main passion. I've played other gigs at that venue before, so they asked me to get involved,' he told The Sun.

British band New Order, famed for their 1990 World Cup song, are among Nevin's playlist favourites

The 51-year-old first took to the turntables during the 1980s London clubbing scene after being inspired by friend and former radio DJ John Peel. 

He added: 'Most of them are indie kids so they probably don't know I am.

'I've played the same venues for ages so they don't care that I was a footballer.'
