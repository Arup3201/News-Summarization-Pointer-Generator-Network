Australia legend Brett Lee was denied a fairytale end to his professional cricket career as the Perth Scorchers beat his Sydney Sixers with a scrambled last-ball single to retain their Big Bash League title.

With Perth needing just one run from three balls to complete a chase of 148 in Canberra, 38-year-old paceman Lee took two wickets in two balls.

But on Lee's final ball, Sydney captain Moises Henriques fumbled a throw at the non-striker's end to allow Yasir Arafat, who was well short of the crease, to complete the single required for victory.

Lee, a veteran of 76 Tests and 221 one-day internationals for Australia in a glittering career, had clean bowled Nathan Coulter-Nile (seven runs) and Sam Whiteman (zero) with the fourth and fifth balls of the final over to set-up the dramatic finale.

But Henriques, who had earlier made 77 in the Sixers' 147-5 and hadn't put a foot wrong in the field, was unable to take in Michael Lumb's throw to stump Arafat and take the final to a Super Over.

Lee was still able to smile afterwards, saying: 'That's cricket. We could have had it there. On this night, they were better than us.

'I tried to block out any other factors and blast those peaks on last time. Someone has to lose. Unfortunately that was us.'

Matthew Klinger's wicket, off the bowling of Lee, proved to be a pivotal moment in the match

The Scorchers, who won the Twenty20 tournament last year, looked in complete control of their run chase, with openers Shaun Marsh and Michael Klinger sharing a partnership of 70.

But the momentum shifted when Klinger was caught in the deep by Shaun Abbott off Lee's bowling in the 12th over and the Sixers fought back.

Perth needed just 17 runs from the last two overs but Marsh holed out to Nathan Lyon, bringing England batsman Michael Carberry into the middle to face Lee's final over.

He produced a scoop shot for four but lost the strike with three balls remaining, allowing Lee to strike twice and set-up the final ball drama.

Henriques had earlier rescued the Sixers from a poor start at 49-4 with a stand of 98 with Ryan Carters, a Big Bash record for the fifth wicket.
