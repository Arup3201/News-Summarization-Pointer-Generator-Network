Most of us are all too familiar with the rage that ensues when fiddly plastic tags defy all attempts to remove them.

But Marks and Spencer has come up with a solution in the shape of a new set of easy-open ties - that will be launched just in time for Christmas.

The brainchild of the team at Design Futures, which is based at Sheffield Hallam University, PaperTies are made from recyclable paper and lock the product in place.  

Impossible: Many of us will be all too familiar with the challenges involved in prising toys from their boxes

Like the traditional plastic variety, they keep toys secured in their box but can be torn away with ease - finally eliminating packaging rage.

The new design is part of the British high street brand's bid to boost its eco credentials, with the company hoping to become the world's most sustainable major retailer by 2020.

As a result of innovations already in place, the company has already reduced by two billion the number of plastic bags it uses and sends zero waste to landfill.

M&S has also become the first retailer to receive the triple award of certification for achievements in carbon, water and waste reduction from the Carbon Trust.

But while the company's green plans are good news for the environment, for customers, getting rid of irritating plastic ties is set to prove the icing on the cake.

The ties, which use a stronger, more flexible version of regular paper, have already been rolled out in the toy department, and will later be used across several product ranges.

Ever hopeful: With Christmas on the way, M&S hope the new packaging will come in handy for parents

Speaking about the new look packaging, Alex Hill, Senior Packaging Technologist, General Merchandise, at M&S said: 'Getting toys out of their packaging can be a big frustration for consumers and we have been working really hard over the last 18 months to find a solution. 

'The PaperTies are designed to be as effective as plastic or metal ties, but can be torn easily - no more accidents trying to cut plastic and wire ties on Christmas Day, and no more frustrated children waiting to play with their new toy.'

'Our design team devised the initial concept for the ties as a direct response to the frustration caused by hard to open toy packaging,' added John Kirkby, creative director at Design Futures.

'We identified a new paper material that is very strong and used it to create a user focused way of holding products in packs. 

'Not only is the product much easier to open but the material is better for the environment. It is very exciting to see the team at M&S develop our initial idea and take it to market.'
