Some racing games opt for realism. Others, sheer arcade fun. But while many have crashed and burned trying to perfect a combination of both, Codemasters seem to have discovered the winning recipe in Grid.

It would be tempting, then, to assume that its sequel would follow the same path many-a-successful game implores and replicates the original adding a new lick of paint?

Hot wheels: To stop things from getting boring, Live Routes ensures tracks keep changing

Thankfully, this is not the case, for it's clear Codemasters have been hard at work, tweaking Grid's engine to squeeze as much out of it as possible - particularly the multiplayer.

Take Grid 2's new-look RaceNet system. Not only has the entire hub been expanded, but now there's a separate online campaign, too.

Then there's Rivals, which pairs you up with anyone in the world to take on a wide range of challenges.

Finally, to add a much-needed slice of unpredictability to track design, Codemasters have unveiled Live Routes.

Tracks are changed and modified, meaning winning a race depends less on who knows the track best, rather who's the best driver on the day. There are potentially millions of different course combinations.

Thankfully, Codemasters have stripped nothing from the single-player campaign, with reports suggesting it takes upwards of 30hours to complete.

Crash and burn: Grid 2 is hellishly fast, striking a difficult balance between realism and entertainment. It's powered by the in-house EGO engine - which allows for detailed damage physics and well-rendered tracks

Graham Bromley, Lead Level Designer for the game told MailOnline: 'GRID2’s online side is at the sweet spot of 12-player multiplayer and to make it more social than ever we’re putting RaceNet, our online player hub for all Codemasters Racing titles, at the very heart of it to deliver additional content through week ‘Global Challenge’ events and our player-matching system ‘Rivals’.

'Multiplayer also lets you customise and upgrade your own car and delivers new styles of racing such as Live Routes events, where no two laps through a city’s streets are the same.'

Grid 2 is out May 28 in North America and May 31 in Europe.
