An Italian lawyer who won one of her clients 180,000 euros (£150,000) in compensation after he was set on fire has been arrested for allegedly stealing it.

Lidia Gabellini, 38, from Rimini, is said to have siphoned money from the account of a homeless man who was severely burnt by thugs as he slept on a bench in the city in 2008.

She is also alleged to have stolen money from at least two other clients, including 1,000 euros from a 21-year-old disabled man awarded the money after he fell off his home’s roof.

She reportedly spent the money on a luxury car and consumer goods, ArticoloTre said.

Investigators have seized 200,000 euros from her bank account, money that they believe is stolen.

According to Italian newspaper Ilrestodelcarlino she told a judge: ‘I am ashamed of my weaknesses. I ask forgiveness.’

Her lawyer, Alexander Petrillo, said: ‘She’s not a monster, but a sick woman. She is very fragile, with serious psychiatric problems.’

Gabellini, a mother of one, is currently in custody in a women’s prison in Forli.

Her alleged fraud was discovered by a police investigation called ‘Vampire’, which uncovered false bank statements she’d used to throw officials off the scent.
