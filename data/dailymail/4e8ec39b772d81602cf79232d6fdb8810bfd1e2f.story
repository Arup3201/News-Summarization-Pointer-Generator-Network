Many Oklahomans are still reeling over what they lost in last week's tornado. But Kellye Cloud is elated at what it gave back.

The terrifying storm unearthed an old purse that was stolen from the Choctaw woman at Wallmart four years ago. In it was a cell phone with precious text messages from her husband, Frank, who died of cancer weeks earlier.

'He was my soul mate. There won't be another Frank,' Cloud said.

Happy find: The terrifying storm unearthed an old purse that was stolen from Kellye Cloud, pictured, at Wallmart four years ago. In it was a cell phone with precious text messages from her husband, Frank

The mother was shocked when she received a call this weekend that her lost purse and cell had been found in the tornado debris near Little Axe, Oklahoma.

'(The person who found it) went on to tell me "we tried to call you and we were looking through the wallet and everything was outdated by two years." I said "that's because it's been missing for four,"' Cloud told News 9 Oklahoma.

Almost everything was still inside the purse, from hand lotion and lipstick to her social security card and family photos, though her checkbook was gone.

Sad: The phone, which miraculously turned on, still contained messages from Frank, including the one pictured

But the cell phone was by far the most treasured find.

'I was devastated, absolutely devastated (when it was taken),' she said.

Miraculously, the old Samsung flip phone had enough power to turn on, and she was overcome to find those last messages from her husband still there.

The Kellye and Frank married in May 2008, and it wasn't long after that Frank was diagnosed with cancer.

Some text messages from the Vietnam veteran-turned-trucker are more poignant than others, Cloud admitted Cloud.

Thrilled: Cloud, pictured, said she was elated to have her old purse back

'Get diet Coke,' read one, which made her laugh.

'He sent me one saying XO, which is hugs and kisses,' she said.

Cloud explained that reading through the text messages even just a few years ago would have brought her to tears but now she said they bring her comfort and make her smile.

'They are his words to me,' she said.

'I can't attribute it to anything but an act of God. I mean, I just can't believe it.'

As Kellye Cloud rejoices her good fortune, Moore resident Tom Bridges also found a silver lining after the terrifying tornado flattened his home last week.

The 68-year-old found a missing $2,000 amid the rubble of his property.

Bridges thought the crisp bills, which he kept in an envelope tucked away atop a window sill, had blown away in the EF-5 rated twister that barreled through the suburb last Monday.

But, after hours of searching through debris with a team of volunteers on Memorial Day, the cash miraculously turned up.

'All of a sudden, I saw the window sill. ... I picked that up, and there it was,' Bridges told CNN shortly after the find. 'I just, I couldn't believe my eyes. It was a miracle.'

He told the network he plans to use the money to buy a new pickup truck, after the tornado totaled his old vehicles.

'Right now, money is money. I got the clothes on my back and a new toothbrush I bought,' he added. 'It means a lot. It's just these little things like that really bring some joy in my heart, which I need.'

Bridges rode out the storm in his cellar and said he got buried in it for 25 minutes until he was rescued by strangers.
