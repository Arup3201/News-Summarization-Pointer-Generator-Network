One in five adults in the UK wants to ban Google Glass completely because of privacy concerns, according to new research.

Researchers based in London surveyed 4,000 adults about the rise of wearable technology.

Despite 18 per cent of those questioned saying they plan to buy Google Glass when it goes on sale next year, 51 per cent expressed serious privacy concerns about the device and 69 per cent demanded greater regulation.

One in five adults in the UK wants to ban Google Glass completely, according to new research. 4,000 adults who were asked about the rise of wearable technology expressed privacy concerns about the devices

Earlier this month the first pornographic app for 
Google Glass was released before being quickly banned.

Adult app store MiKandi, makers of the headmounted pornography, were told by Google to remove the app and have been prohibited from making any such content.

The 'T***
& Glass,' app was downloaded 
from the developer's website by 17 Google Glass owners on its debut day,
while the site was visited by some 10,000 people.

The app allowed viewers to browse adult content and, with Glass’s capability of displaying and recording, the app also reportedly allowed users to record and upload their own intimate content.

The study was 
commissioned by web hosting company Rackspace with the Centre for Creative 
and Social Technology (CAST) at Goldsmiths, University of London.

They asked 2,000 UK adults and 2,000 adults in the U.S. their thoughts on wearable technology including whether they would buy devices, such as Google Glass, how they think they would use it, and what their biggest concerns were.

More than half (51 per cent) of all the adults asked expressed serious privacy concerns about using wearable technology, with 53 per cent of UK adults likening it to TV show ‘Big Brother’.

Around two thirds of all participants - 61 per cent - think Google Glass and wearable cameras should 
be regulated, while 20 per cent think it 
should be banned altogether.

Respondents in the UK demand greater regulation, 69 per cent, compared to 55 per cent in the US.

'As with all new products that are cutting edge, there is always the question of how current laws, combined with consumer expectations, fit in with the product', says John Haggis, digital media lawyer at London-based media law firm Sheridans.

'When wearable technologies interact with other people and the environment around the user, then potential privacy or copyright issues can arise.'

A model for adult app store MiKandi is shown wearing Google Glass. The company released the device's first pornography app called 'T*** & Glass' Monday but it was promptly shut down by Google. Privacy campaigners are concerned about such adult content leading to malware and other risks on wearable technology

'The challenge for manufacturers of 
wearable technologies is ensuring that where the device has the 
potential to infringe another person’s rights, that the user is made 
aware of how they should be using the device and also for other people 
to recognise when the device is being used in a manner which they may 
object, such as surreptitious videoing or photographing of people.'

'Hopefully manufacturers will take the
lead in this area so that new regulations are not needed.

'But it 
shouldn’t come as a surprise if law makers decide to act to both compel 
manufacturers to take privacy and other concerns into consideration when
developing these products, and also to protect people’s expectations of
privacy.'

Nick Pickles, director of privacy 
and civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, added: 'The danger 
with Google Glass is that the camera is seeing what you see, all the 
time, while the microphone allows nearby conversations to be 
eavesdropped on.

'It 
is impossible to guarantee against these devices being hacked, so it 
would be surprising if people are allowed to wear them anywhere like 
Government buildings or in businesses that handle sensitive intellectual
property.

'While it’s
still dangerous to have a situation where someone could use glass 
without permission from the other people who are being monitored by the 
device, the implications of them being controlled by an unknown third 
party would make phone hacking look like a minor blip.

'Google
Glass offers a uniquely detailed view of your life and your 
surroundings and while Google’s main interest is selling advertising, 
there are a whole range of reasons why other people might seek to do all
they can to get access to a device.

'The only way to protect yourself and the people around you is to not wear them.'

In May, Google's Glass wearable computer was hacked so video and audio can be transmitted online to anyone.

The infographic also reveals how Glass is focused so the image always appears sharp

Hackers are able to remotely watch and hear everything a wearer does, and
the hackers recently warned 'nothing is safe once your Glass has been hacked.'

Although
Glass does not go on sale to the public until next year, the attack 
raises major security and privacy questions over Google's plans for the 
device.

Despite the negative responses to the Rackspace study, an average of 18 per cent intend to buy Google Glass when it
goes on sale in 2014 - 21 per cent  of Americans and 15 per cent of 
Brits.

71 per cent of Brits believe that these cloud-powered devices have 
enhanced their lives in some way and 12 per cent of UK adults are already using wearable devices to improve their love life.

Last week the first marriage proposal using Google Glass was recorded at Leeds Castle in Kent.

Whereas 63 per cent of UK and 71 per cent of American respondents said that wearable technology has improved their health and fitness.

The CAST study also revealed seven distinct profiles of people who use wearable technology.

Another example of wearable technology is smart watches. This mockup of the much-rumoured iWatch was created by MacUser magazine. It is expected to link to an iPhone, and compete with Google's Glass in the wearable computer market

Curious users have no particular health, fitness, food, mood or emotional need for wearable technology.

They are simply interested in what happens when they 'play' with these devices.

Controllers tend to see everything in their life as 'a selection of parts contributing towards an overall ecosystem.'

They will only purchase the device 
once they know that it will do what they want it to do and they can 
manage their data the way that they want to 

The Quantified Selfer wants to track everything they do.

Self Medics use wearable devices to take control over health and well-being.

Google Glass was hacked earlier this year. Robert Scoble, a tech blogger, tweeted a picture of himself in the shower with Google Glass, which led to experts warning 'private moments' such as these could be seen by hackers. These reports have led to more than half of people asked in a recent study expressing serious privacy concerns about the device, and 69 per cent of UK adults calling for more regulation

Self Medics also often use multiple apps and devices to get an accurate account of their health.

Finish line Fanatics love the idea of
the device and are really excited at the start, yet once they realise it
needs to be calibrated, charged, synced and sometimes needs them to 
manually add data, the shine wears off. 

To the Transition Entrepreneur his 
phone is classed as a form of ‘wearable tech’ because he always has it 
on him, so he needs more from any other gadgets to make them all link 
together.

And finally, the Ubiquitous Future users are children who will grow up with the next generation of wearable technology and not know any different. 

The respondents were also asked about future technologies.

32 per cent of respondents said they are most excited about the arrival of nanotechnology such as microscopic ‘robots’ that could, for example, travel through blood and turn off cancer cells.

29 per cent admitted they are excited about the introduction of bionic limbs, a common feature in movies such as i-Robot and Bicentennial Man.
