Sergio Aguero is not just top of this season's Premier League scoring charts. The Argentine, having now played 101 times in the English top flight, has far and away the lowest minutes per goal ratio in Premier League history.

Aguero hits the net on average once every 108 minutes, 13 minutes quicker than Arsenal legend Thierry Henry.

He is arguably in the greatest form of his career, with 14 goals already this term, and bagged a double in Manchester City's 4-1 win at Sunderland on Wednesday night.

With as many goals as games this season, Aguero is on course to beat Cristiano Ronaldo's record (in a 38-game season) of 31 goals in the 2007-08 season.

The full table, shown below, charts striker's records who have played over 100 games in the top flight, with Aguero miles ahead of the pack after a century of appearances.

In 7126 minutes he has 66 goals, ahead of Henry and 20 minutes quicker than former Manchester United hit man Ruud van Nistelrooy.

Thierry Henry scored 175 goals in 258 games during his two stints at Arsenal

Luis Suarez, who left Liverpool in the summer, scored 69 goals in 110 appearances

Javier Hernandez played just one game more than Aguero, but nearly 2,500 less minutes at Manchester United. His 37 goals, mainly as a substitute, puts him fourth in the list with a goal every 129.6 minutes.

Elsewhere on the list is Robin van Persie (138.3), Edin Dzeko (138.7) and Luis Suarez (138.8)

Aguero has scored 45 per cent of Manchester City’s goals in the Premier League this season, and has directly won nine points for the club through his contributions with goals and assists.

And with the Argentine on fire, Manuel Pellegrini believes City are back on title-winning form.

Robin van Persie has scored a goal roughly every 138 minutes in the Premier League

Ruud van Nistelrooy is third on the list, posting a goal every 128.2 minutes in the top flight

Edin Dzeko, not always first-choice striker at Manchester City, has a healthy minutes per goal ratio

Another super sub, Javier Hernandez, has 37 goals in 102 games for Manchester United

He said after Wednesday evening's win at the Stadium of Light: 'I think we are returning to the performances we had last season. I think if we continue playing this way of course we will fight for the title, but I think three or four other teams will also be there.

'[Aguero] is an important player but it is not just Sergio Aguero - we play in a way that it is very useful for him to score but it is important for him not just to think about scoring but to play for the team.

'There are a lot of good strikers but I said before the last game that I am sure he is one of the best five players in the world because he is not just scoring, he is playing very well.'  

Aguero is on course to beat Cristiano Ronaldo's 38-game record of 31 goals in a Premier League season
