With his smiling mother and aunt, this is little Fionan Terry in one of the first portraits of his extraordinary family.

But the happy picture belies the emotional roller-coaster the two sisters have endured to bring him into the world.

For not only is Ellie Fairfax his aunt, she is also his surrogate mother – stepping in to carry the baby after her sister learnt treatment for cervical cancer would leave her infertile.

Happy family: Siobhan Terry, left, and surrogate mother and sister Ellie Fairfax with three-month-old Fionan

Adorable: He is biologically Ellie's son but she says she only ever thought of him as Siobhan's baby

Siobhan Terry, 31, longed for another child to make her family complete, but was told she would never be able to give her daughter Saoirse, two, a brother or sister.

Thanks to the remarkable selflessness of Miss Fairfax, though, she is now the delighted mother of Fionan. He was born three months ago weighing 6lb 4oz after a four-hour labour.

For the first fortnight after Fionan’s birth, Miss Fairfax, 33, went to live with her sister and husband Dean, 51, to help the baby settle in. 

Yesterday Miss Fairfax, a trainee cardiac physiologist, said: ‘Although Fionan is biologically mine, from the moment he was conceived to the magical time I held him for the first time, I only ever thought of him as Siobhan’s baby.

‘So it was never hard to let him go to her. I just felt relieved when he was born that he was healthy and delighted to see him bring Siobhan and Dean so much joy.’

Mrs Terry said: ‘Words cannot express how much I can ever thank Ellie for what she’s done. Dean and I are simply overjoyed to be parents again and Saoirse already dotes on her little brother.’

The sisters, from Beckenham, south-east London, are the eldest of four and have always been close.

There are two types of surrogacy. One is ‘straight’ (or traditional), where a surrogate uses her own eggs and is artificially inseminated with the father’s sperm.

However, the majority of cases in the UK are host (or gestational) surrogacy, where IVF is carried out with the eggs and sperm of the intended parents. The embryo is then implanted into the surrogate mother.

Under English law, the legal mother of the child is the surrogate. The intended mother is not recognised as a parent, even if she is the child’s biological mother.

After six weeks the ‘parents’ can apply for a Parental Order that will give them full parental rights over the child.

But their bond grew stronger when Mrs Terry was diagnosed with cancer in December 2012 after a routine smear test. 

She said: ‘Knowing I urgently needed radiotherapy and chemotherapy was devastating. But Dean and I had hoped to have a sibling for Saoirse. 

'So it was a double blow when doctors broke the news that saving my life would destroy my eggs and leave my uterus too scarred to carry a baby.’

When she told her family the heartbreaking news, her sister, who has no children of her own, instantly volunteered to carry a baby for her.

They bought an artificial insemination kit and after two months of trying using publican Mr Terry’s sperm, Miss Fairfax became pregnant. 

She said: ‘It was Siobhan’s birthday and telling her I was pregnant was the most wonderful gift to give her.’

Miss Fairfax, who gave birth in a birthing pool, said: ‘Siobhan cut the cord and it felt completely natural for her to take him in her arms for a cuddle. 

'I’ll never forget seeing her kiss him for the first time and seeing then how much a new baby meant to her.’

She added: ‘While Fionan will always be a special nephew, I was happy to let Siobhan and Dean deal with the nappies and sleepless nights while I went back to my studies.’

The sisters are telling their story to raise awareness of cervical cancer.
