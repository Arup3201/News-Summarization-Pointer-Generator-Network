A 51-year-old British holidaymaker who allegedly started a fire at a Benidorm hotel is facing nine years in jail.

Andrew Dmytruk, from Nottingham, started the blaze that left 13 guests in hospital after earlier setting fire to chairs, tables and a pub awning, prosecutors claimed.

But Dmytruk's lawyer said he has the mental age of a seven-year-old, and campaign group Fair Trials International have taken up his case.

The group's website says that Dmytruk 'has been heavily dependent on his 77-year-old mother throughout his adult life.'

He had been celebrating his birthday on holiday with his widowed mother, Doris O'Brien, at the time of the incident. She says he is innocent and did not start the hotel fire.

The three-star Ambassador hotel was evacuated after Dmytruk allegedly set fire to his room.

The 10-storey, 200-room hotel filled with black smoke and 13 Brits, mostly pensioners, were taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation.

Dymtruk has been on remand in Spain for  almost two years after he was arrested over the December 2010 fire.

Prosecutors said today that they would call for him to be jailed for nine years at his forthcoming trial.

Doctors said he is fit to stand trial for arson, but Fair Trials International said: 'Owing to complications from meningitis that he suffered as a baby, Andrew has the mental age of a young child.

'He has been refusing much of the food 
given to him and in March 2012 he attempted suicide, leaving him 
increasingly withdrawn and his mother increasingly worried.'

The group said Dmytuk has been denied bail largely because he is a foreigner.

Benidorm, near Alicante on Spain's east 
coast, attracts around a million Britons each year, making it one of our
favourite holiday destinations.
