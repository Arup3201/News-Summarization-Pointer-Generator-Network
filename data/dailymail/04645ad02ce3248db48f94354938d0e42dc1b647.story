Guan Quanzi was bitten by a panicked wild panda that had been chased onto his land in China by officials when they found it was roaming free in a village and may still need his leg amputated

A man may lose his leg after he was attacked by a wild panda as it was chased by locals after it wandered into a village in China.

Guan Quanzhi was set upon by the panda, which sunk its teeth into his leg, as officials chased it into his land in Liziba village near Longnan City in Gansu Province.

A quick thinking villager threw a coat over the animal's head which made it let go of Mr Quanzhi who was left severely injured. He had to have a seven hour operation to try and repair the damage. 

In the last year Mr Quanzhi has spent months in hospital and had a total of eight operations. He has recently been told he may have to have his leg amputated, according to the People's Daily online.

'When the giant panda sunk its teeth into my leg the pain was indescribable. Blood was everywhere,' said Mr Quanzhi. 

Pandas have a 'cuddly' reputation but can be territorial. They have strong jaws which enable them to strip bamboo but this also means they can deliver a powerful bite. 

The incident took place on March 1 last year when the panda wandered into a village near Longnan City in Gansu Province.

Locals attempted to capture the animal only for it to flee them and run into Mr Quanzhi's land. 

Mr Quanzhi, who is in his 60s, added: 'I was working at home and saw many people running in my direction, looking closer I could see a mud-covered panda being chased.' 

As the animal saw Mr Quanzhi was blocking its path he sunk its teeth into its leg until someone threw a coat over it. 

The panda fled and disappeared after being seen wandering around in the mountains for more than half an hour. 

Locals realised Mr Quanzhi was seriously injured and he was taken to Qingchuan County People's hospital, which was more than 10km away, for emergency treatment.

The next day Mr Quanzhi had to endure a seven hour operation to repair the broken bone in his leg and stem a ruptured vein. 

He was in hospital for two months.

Because of his family's financial circumstances the village council and the Forestry Bureau  borrowed 70,000 yuan (£7,500) and 30,000 yuan (£3,000) respectively. 

The panda was seen roaming around the village and attacked Mr Quanzi, sinking its teeth into his leg 

The panda, normally a docile animal, was chased and is believed to have panicked when it bit Mr Quanzi 

Officials had been chasing the panda after they realised the wild animal was roaming around the village 

Mr Quanzi has been forced to endure eight operations and weeks in hospital since he was bitten by the panda 

His son said: 'My father stayed in hospital for 57 days, during this time he had skin grafts as well as various operations. 

'After so much suffering and over such a long period of time part of his leg muscles have slowly shrunk and this has led to him not being able to walk on his leg and no longer being able to look after himself.' 

Mr Quanzhi was told that because his recovery has been unsatisfactory he is likely to need further surgery and may need to have his leg amputated.

He took the Provincial Forestry Department, Longnan City's County Forestry Bureau and the Whitewater River National Nature Reserve Administration, home to around 100 wild pandas, to court. 

The animal had wandered into the village and is believed to have been looking for food when it was spotted 

Experts have warned that while pandas have a 'cute and cuddly' reputation they do have strong jaws 

The panda (centre) was seen wandering around Liziba Village and was spotted by locals who reported it 

He was recently awarded 520,000 yuan (£56,000) in compensation from the three parties.

'Although giant panda's are generally docile, they are still wild animals, and are territorial,' Director of the Giant Panda Protection and Research Centre of China, Zhang Hemin.

'Pandas rarely ever attack people, but if people enter their territory they will attack in self-defense as a warning.'

The animals are an important draw for tourists in China, and several are rented out to zoos. 

They have also been known to attack people in the past. In 2008 a panda mauled a 20-year-old man who scaled a 6ft tall barrier to climb into its enclosure at a zoo in southern China. 

The panda was apparently scared by the intruder and bit the man on his arms and legs.
