Police have identified Scott Allen Miller, 42, as a suspect in the murder of a woman found on Saturday morning in Melbourne

Police in Victoria have released a photo of a man they believe may be involved in the murder of a Melbourne woman whose body was found on Saturday.

The naked body of the woman, who is yet to be formally identified, was discovered by a jogger near the Royal Botanic Gardens in Southbank about 8.30am.

Officers say 42-year-old homeless man Scott Allen Miller is a suspect in the death of the Chinese woman, found in the gardens near where Miller had reportedly been sleeping.

The homicide squad's Sergeant Nathan Favre said the woman was aged in her 30s and worked in hospitality. It is believed she was on her way to work when she was assaulted.

'We can't rule out sexual assault as the motivation for this offence,' Det Sgt Favre told AAP.

He said police wanted to speak to Miller about several items found at the crime scene.

Miller has been sleeping on the streets of the city for at least six weeks and is known to police in other states, although not for violence related matters.

Detective Sergeant Favre said detectives believed Miller may still be in Melbourne, and anyone who sees him should contact police and not approach him.

'Police are working tirelessly to solve this crime,' he said. 'We ask that members of the public not be alarmed but certainly be vigilant.'

A statement released by Victoria Police said 'investigators seized a number of items at the scene and believe Scott may be able to assist police with their investigation. '

Anyone with information about the death is urged to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or visit www.crimestoppersvic.com.au.
