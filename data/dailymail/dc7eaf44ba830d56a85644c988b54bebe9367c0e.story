How cold is it in Iowa? So cold a wet t-shirt froze stiff in
under a minute.

Tom Rauen, of Dubuque, uploaded a video to YouTube of his
frozen fun in the frigid weather that has set the internet ablaze.

Wind chill values in Dubuque reached a robust -20 Fahrenheit
Monday afternoon, according to the Weather Underground.

The start: Tom Rauen doused the shirt in water and took it outside

Mr Rauen, owner of Envision Tees, decided to have a little
fun with the glacial temps outside his toasty office.

He doused a t-shirt in water and dressed up as if he were
going on a polar expedition before heading outside.

The shirt soon starts to become a little stiff, and Mr Rauen
then takes out the hanger and starts to push out the sides to make it look like
it is being worn by a person.

Starting to freeze: He then began pushing the sides of the shirt out as it began to stiffen

Ta da!: The shirt is frozen so solidly that it stands on its own

Frozen solid: Mr Rauen picks the shirt up and examines his handiwork

I see you!: He looks through the center of the shirt before taking it inside and ripping it to shreds

After less than a minute, the shirt is standing up
completely on its own.

Not content to just let the t-shirt stand in the cold, Mr
Rouen takes it inside and tears it in half.

This is not the first t-shirt stunt pulled by Mr Rouen.

He set the Guinness Worldâ€™s Record in in 2011 for most
t-shirts ever worn by one person, according to KCRG.

He wore 247 of them while raising $5,000 for the Juvenile
Diabetes research Foundation.

Mr Rouen's hijinks may have temporarily distracted him from the bone-chilling cold, but temperatures are forecast Tuesday to get even chillier. The cold snap should break by the end of the week.
