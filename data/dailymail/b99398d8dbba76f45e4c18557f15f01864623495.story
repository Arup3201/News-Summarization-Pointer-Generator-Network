Arrested: Edward Venteroso, 46, held a 55-year-old woman prisoner in her own home while he assaulted her with a cast-iron pan and prevented her from seeking medical assistance, police said

A Colorado man kept a 55-year-old woman prisoner in her own rural home while he assaulted her with a cast-iron pan and prevented her from seeking medical assistance, police said.

Edward Venteroso, 46, was arrested after deputies discovered he had imprisoned Kathy Harris for two days in her home on the outskirts of Durango.

The Durango Herald reports that La Plata County Sheriff's deputies responded to an emergency call around 7 a.m. Wednesday.

When the door to the house was opened, Harris fell to the ground bloody and nearly unconscious, begging for help from police.

The deputies arrested Venteroso, who had allegedly entered Harris's home on Tuesday and kept her locked in the house and unable to seek medical care while he assaulted her.

Police say he also damaged Harris's phone in order to keep the woman from calling 911.

La Plata County Sheriff's spokesperson Lt Dan Bender said she was transported to Mercy Regional Medical Center with head and ear injuries, including some caused by a cast-iron frying pan.

Venteroso had reportedly been living on Harris's property, but had a protection order against him stemming from a previous assault against Harris. 

Venteroso was charged with first-degree assault, violation of a protection order, false imprisonment and obstructing telephone service and he remains in custody Friday on $25,000 bond.
