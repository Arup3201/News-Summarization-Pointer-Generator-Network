As usual, Louis van Gaal wasn’t going to accept criticism.

When a journalist persisted in a line of questioning about the shortcomings of the new system Holland had adopted during their friendly with Ghana, Van Gaal finally lost patience.

‘I’ve been assigned to win. I need to get the best out of this team. That and nothing else,’ he snapped back.

He then added, lest anyone be in any doubt as to who was in charge: ‘I make my own decisions on what formation I play. No director says how I play. I choose a team and a system that I think has the best chance of success.’

One's enough: Robin van Persie scored the only goal as an experimental Holland triumphed 1-0 over Ghana

Wasteful: Holland's winning margin over Ghana could have been much more had Robben not squandered a number of chances

‘Total Football’ it wasn’t, but Holland had emerged from their penultimate World Cup warm-up game with a 1-0 victory, secured when Robin van Persie tapped in after just five minutes, and Van Gaal was happy enough.

As he pointed out, Holland had created six good opportunities at the De Kuip in Rotterdam and Ghana had created not one. They would have been home and dry by half-time had Arjen Robben not been so wasteful.

It was an open secret that Van Gaal was set to trial a new formation in this match and those who didn’t know could easily have guessed it from Friday’s training session which was attended by 5,000 fans.

The accent was on flying wing-backs - on this occasion, Daley Blind of Ajax and Daryl Janmaat of Feyenoord - in a 5-3-2 formation that could quickly shift to a 3-4-3 when Holland were on the attack.

Blind and 
Janmaat were encouraged to bomb forward at every opportunity and they 
contributed assists for Robben’s two squandered chances in the 
first-half, showing the potential effectiveness of the system.

In
 the midfield, Nigel de Jong and Jonathan de Guzman offered cover for 
the defence against any Ghanaian counter-attacks and, up front, Robin 
van Persie spearheaded a forward trio of Robben and Wesley Sneijder.

Plan B: Holland boss Louis van Gaal deployed a 5-3-2 formation which morphed into a 3-4-3 during the win

Lead role: Van Gaal's new system is set to fit at Manchester United next season, with Van Persie likely to spearhead the attack

Strong support cast: Wayne Rooney (right) and Juan Mata would play off Van Persie in the formation

It was a formation that certainly has the potential to be exciting and the critical tone of some of the questions in the post-match press conference would surely have been avoided if Holland had won 3-0 or 4-0 like they should have done.

Van Gaal said he had devised the system as a means of playing Spain at their own game, of fighting fire with fire, when they meet in their opening World Cup group match on June 13.

He also hinted that it could be a set-up he brings to the Premier League when he takes over as Manchester United manager next season - or ‘after the World Cup final’ as he put it.

If that 
happens, we’ll certainly be in for some fun and games at Old Trafford. 
Van Gaal will need two attack-minded wing-backs to thunder up and down 
the flanks and deliver effective crosses.

Luke
 Shaw’s £27m move from Southampton looks set to be confirmed any day and
 the teenager will be given a licence to attack in the United tradition 
regardless of the formation. Blind is also on the Old Trafford radar and
 could also serve in his natural defensive midfield role.

Van
 Gaal will then need someone identical on the right-hand side, either 
Rafael or the likes of Dani Alves, whose time at Barcelona is reportedly
 drawing to a close, or Serge Aurier, the buccaneering Toulouse player 
who is interesting Arsenal as Bacary Sagna’s replacement.

Pulling the strings? Long time Manchester United target Cesc Fabregas (left) would be an ideal fit in midfield 

Versatile: Daley Blind featured against Ghana at left-back and the Ajax star can also play as a defensive midfielder

Closing in: Manchester United are hoping to complete a £27million deal for Southampton and England left-back Luke Shaw

A timid Ghana side, which contained a number of second string players in the first-half as coach Kwesi Appiah makes the final call on his 23 for Brazil, failed to trouble the Dutch back line, but that will be a different story in the Premier League.

Accordingly, Van Gaal is targeting Mats Hummels of Borussia Dortmund and Miranda of Atletico Madrid to strengthen his defence.

United’s midfield were regularly embarrassed last season during the David Moyes tenure and reinforcements are desperately needed here too.

Van Gaal will look at compatriot Kevin Strootman, who was very impressive for Roma before a cruciate ligament injury curtailed his season. He would certainly be in the Dutch World Cup midfield if not for this misfortune.

Barcelona’s Cesc Fabregas would fill the vacancy with style but United face stiff competition for his signature from Arsenal and Manchester City.

Up front, it would be Van Persie leading the attack ahead of Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata. There’s a strong possibility that Rooney is heading for a midfield role under Van Gaal and he’s likely to be overlooked for the captain’s armband in favour of Van Persie, who gets on very well with his national team manager.

But on the evidence of the match with Ghana, this does not necessarily mean that Rooney will cut a frustrated figure as he sits backs in the midfield. Sneijder and Robben took turns to try and break into the penalty box, while Van Persie was not shy in dropping back to try and win the ball.

The goalscorer would often by found trying to win the ball aerially close to the touchline from goal kicks and long balls from defence, with Janmaat a willing outlet out wide.

Van Gaal fervently believes his new system will deliver the Dutch success at the World Cup. How about defending champions Spain as the acid test?
