Lined up next to their deadly shipment of bomb-making equipment and weapons, these four Taliban fanatics include a woman clad head to foot in a blue burka.

It is believed she was travelling from Pakistan with a child – a ploy often used by insurgents to avoid detection.

The group were arrested by police in Afghanistan as they tried to make their way in to the country on Thursday.

Arrested: Four Taliban fighters, including a woman dressed in a full-length burka, stand handcuffed near seized weapons at the police headquarters in Jalalabad, eastern Afghanistan

Caught: The four Taliban militants - including a woman and a child - were arrested by Afgan border police at the Torkham border crossing between Afghanistan and Pakistan

Officers discovered they had been carrying an assault rifle and ammunition.

The arsenal also included all the parts needed to construct improvised explosive devices (IEDs).

It comes after Afghan Army officers secured a large stockpile of weapons and ammunition from various operations in Kabul and Logar Provinces from Taliban militants on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, American officials claim the shrinking U.S. combat role in Afghanistan has given insurgents an opening to devise and carry out deadlier attacks using bigger improvised bombs against coalition military vehicles and bases. 

With fewer U.S. forces patrolling road networks beyond their bases - and with the grounding of eye-in-the-sky surveillance balloons known as aerostats - Taliban fighters are adapting their tactics, according to officials at a Pentagon agency that tracks attacks that use improvised explosive devices, or IEDs.

Ongoing fight: The stockpile of weapons and ammunition were seized during various operations in Kabul and Logar Provinces against Taliban fighters

'Insurgents are able to invest more 
time in preparing and staging an attack, and when we see an effective 
attack, it tends to be more lethal to our forces,' said Al Sweetser, 
chief of the operations analysis division at the Joint IED Defeat 
Organization, which has its own team of analysts on the ground in 
Afghanistan.

So while 
the number of IED attacks against U.S. and coalition troops - as well as
 the total casualties they cause - has declined, certain attacks can be 
more elaborately planned, precisely targeted and more lethal because the
 insurgents have time and room to prepare, Sweetser and other American 
officials said.
