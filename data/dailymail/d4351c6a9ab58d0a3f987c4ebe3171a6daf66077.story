Manchester United winger Wilfried Zaha will head back to the club for pre-season determined to break into the first-team fold as the Louis van Gaal era dawns at Old Trafford.

Zaha is yet to be informed whether he will be a part of Manchester United’s pre-season tour of the USA but he is hopeful that he will be included in the group as the club head across the Atlantic to warm up for the new season with matches against LA Galaxy, Roma, Inter Milan and Real Madrid.

He is expected to learn his fate in the coming weeks once Van Gaal touches down in Manchester after Holland’s involvement at the World Cup, but Sportsmail understands that Zaha’s preference would be to remain with United next season.

The former Crystal Palace wide-man endured an immensely disappointing first season at Old Trafford under David Moyes, where the England under-21 international failed to start a single match in the Barclays Premier League before being loaned out to Cardiff City in January.

Zaha was Sir Alex Ferguson’s final signing as Manchester United manager, joining the club in a £15million deal and on a five-and-a-half year contract.

United will not be keen to give up on such a significant investment so early in his spell at the club.

However, there is also a recognition that work will need to be done to resuscitate the winger’s Manchester United career after a debut campaign fraught with tension. 

Challenge: Zaha has struggled to make the step up at United since joining from Crystal Palace

Despite impressing on the club’s pre-season tour, relations between Zaha and United became increasingly strained last season, with former manager Moyes showing little faith at all in the 21-year-old.

Although the player felt that he was not being given a fair chance by Moyes, the consensus from United insiders was that Zaha had failed to adapt to the very highest standards expected by the club.

Moyes felt that his contribution on the training ground was below the level that he demanded and senior figures became concerned around December that there was little sign of improvement.

For all the defects in Zaha’s game, however, supporters and certain coaches began to question why Zaha was not handed an opportunity in the first-team when established regulars such as Antonio Valencia, Ashley Young, Nani and Shinji Kagawa so often produced below-par performances, as United slumped to 7th place in the Barclays Premier League and crashed out of both the Capital One Cup and FA Cup in January.

Van Gaal is expected to take guidance from assistant manager Ryan Giggs over his young players but Zaha’s raw pace and ability to take players on may appeal to a manager whose teams are known for attacking with speed and on the counter-attack.

However, after also struggling for form under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Cardiff, Zaha has work to do to convince the United hierarchy that he can make a positive contribution at Old Trafford.
