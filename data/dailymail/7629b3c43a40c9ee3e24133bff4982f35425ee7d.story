A thief who shot a have-a-go hero when the brave man tried to stop his brother from being robbed was lynched to death by furious friends and family.

Twenty-two-year-old Alexis Jimenez had returned from giving his girlfriend a ride home early in the morning when he was attacked by two men in the western Argentinian city of Tucuman, the Buenos Aires Herald reported.

The young man's brother Cesar, 28, heard the commotion outside his house and went to see what was happening when thief Daniel Gustavo Guerrero pulled out a 9mm pistol and shot him in the neck before fleeing.

Thief Daniel Guerrero's was surrounded and attacked by an angry mob of neighbours who had beat him to death for shooting dead Alexis Jimenez in the western Argentinean city of Tucaman

Cesar Jimenez, who worked at the National University of Tucaman and had recently welcomed a new baby daughter, died at the hospital about five hours later. 

He had previously been the victim of a violent robbery three years ago, when he was shot in the leg.

The 5.30am gunfire woke his neighbours to the recent attack, and some of them attended to Cesar while others tracked the thief down in minutes and beat him so badly he later died, Infobae reported.

When police arrived they found the battered body of Guerrero lying in a pool of his own blood and surrounded by angry locals.

A video shows a man kicking him in the head and police nonchalantly asking him to stop. 

A friend of the Jimenezes, Bricio Paez, 30, said: 'The scum got what he deserved.

'If you kill one of ours you will get killed too.

'It's the rule of law, our law.'

Police said they guarded the body from attackers while waiting for an ambulance, though observers said they stood by and some participated in the beating

Some of the Jimenezes' neighbours said that police also beat Guerrero, who had a long criminal record.

However, police said that officers kept guard over the body while neighbours delayed an ambulance's arrival.

Guerrero died shortly after being taken to a local hospital. 

Public lynch mobs in the city and region are commonplace, with this incident on Jan 11 being the second attempted killing this year.

Last week a thief who stole a mobile phone was beaten unconscious by local vigilantes but survived.

At the end of last year, four other similar incidents took place in the region.

When asked last year for a response Governor Jose Alperovich said, 'I don't know how I would react if I was the victim of a crime.

'One has to be in their [the vigilantes'] shoes.'
