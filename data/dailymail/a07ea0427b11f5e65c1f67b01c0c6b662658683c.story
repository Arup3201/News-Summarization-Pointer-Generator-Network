It is known as the Festival of lights – so Samantha Cameron made sure she dazzled.

The Prime Minister’s wife arrived at a Diwali party in London last night wearing a beautiful flowing royal blue sari with a detailed gold trim. 

The 43-year-old’s colourful attire certainly stood out against her husband David Cameron’s rather more austere blue suit.

The couple were attending a bash put on by the Conservative party in Westminster to celebrate Diwali, the five-day Hindu festival celebrated in autumn every year.

The couple lit a candle to begin the celebrations, before David Cameron gave a speech on the contribution that the eight million Hindus in the UK had made to the country.

Attendees said he told the audience that the Conservatives would be the first political party to have a British Asian Prime Minister, before quipping ‘but not immediately’.

At the event, Mr Cameron also launched the new Encyclopaedia of Hinduism, an 11-volume project about the religion involving 1000 contributors.

For Hindus, Diwali is one of the most important events in the year, with fireworks and lamps used to create a riot of colour to celebrate the victory of good over evil, sweets are traded and new clothes bought.

Lamps are lit and kept on during the night and families come together to carry out traditional tasks such as cleaning the house to honour the goddess Lakshmi.

The Prime Minister also hosted an annual Diwali party at Downing Street last Friday.
