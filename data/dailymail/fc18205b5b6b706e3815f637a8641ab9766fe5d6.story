A thick sparkling frost coated much of the UK today, leaving many places cold but with a winter wonderland look.

Rivers across the country had chunks of ice floating them as everywhere from Scarborough to Hampshire experienced bitterly cold conditions.

Scotland in particular suffered, as snow dusted the north of the country and residents had to wrap up warm against the plummeting temperatures.

But the festive appearance is about to melt away, as heavy rain and gale force winds are working their way from the Atlantic towards the UK.

The western weather front is expected to
bring winds reaching speeds of up to 50mph tomorrow across the UK, with
wet spells estimated to produce 20-25mm rain in the south-west of 
England and south wales.

A spokesman for the Met Office said: 'It's an area of low pressure that 's bringing the weather front from the west.

'Tomorrow will be much milder over the UK, with the temperature hitting highs of 7C to 11C. The south will see temperatures in double figures.

'It'll be a wet day for the south west of England.

'In eastern parts of Scotland, there is expected to be 20 to 40mm of rain.

'There will be gusts of up to 40pmh and 50pmh everywhere.

'Exposed southern coasts and higher grounds will see gusts of up to 60mph.'

Today had been predicted to be the coldest day of the year, with temperatures last night dropping to -12C in Scotland.

There was a dusting of snow in the northern parts of Scotland, but most of the country only experienced a glittering frost and some fog last night and the early part of this morning.

But the Met Office revealed that it had been mild compared to the sub-zero conditions in February, where a temperature of -15C was recorded in Holbeach, Lincolnshire, making that that the coldest date of the year so far.

The spokesman said: 'This year's winter is only 12 and bit days old, so it's been the coldest day of the season so far.'

Today the thermometer will hover 
between 2C and 4C in most places - although cities including Liverpool 
and Birmingham will feel the chill as the temperature does not reach any
higher than 1C.

But after 
the wet and windy conditions tomorrow, at least the weekend will bring a
welcome rise in temperature, and even some sunny spells.

The spokesman said: 'The weather will be milder, there will just be showers around the country.

'There will be some dry spells. It will be generally cloudy with some sunny spells.'

Yesterday
freezing fog and ice brought beautiful scenes to the countryside but 
transport chaos in many cities yesterday as temperatures plummeted to
