Bayern Munich have every reason to celebrate, as they sit top of the Bundesliga tree approaching the winter break.

Pep Guardiola's side have already extended a seven-point gap over their nearest rivals Wolfsburg, and were treated to a lavish celebration at their annual Christmas party on Sunday.

The players turned out with friends and families at star chef Alfons Schuhbeck's theatre show, boasting cabaret, comedy and acrobatics, as well as a meal created by the chef.

Bayern president Karl-Heinze Rummenigge addressed the players and their guests in a 10-minute speech, celebrating a 'very, very good' 2014 for both club and country.

'It's normally almost a given that we have problems after major tournaments,' Rummenigge said. 'Lots of people expected it again this season. But fortunately it's turned out differently. Our performances and the work put in by the coaches is unbelievable.'

'The last three or four years have been an unbelievable experience.'

Former Bayern Munich and Manchester City centre-back Daniel Van Buyten was a special guest at the party, and Rummenigge was eager to publicly thank his ex-player after his retirement in the summer.

'I take my hat off to what you achieved for Bayern,' he said to Van Buyten, before turning his attention to Bayern's 1-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen the previous day.

Franck Ribery scored the only goal of the game, taking Bayern's impressive record to 11 wins and no losses in 14 matches this season.
