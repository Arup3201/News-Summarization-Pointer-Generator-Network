Suspected Nazi war criminals were quietly paid millions by US taxpayers to leave the country without putting up a fight, an investigation has revealed.

Dozens of people, including members of Hitler's SS who guarded death camps where millions of Jews were slaughtered, were handed the cash in exchange for leaving the country and giving up citizenship.

A scientist who used slave labor to invent the Third Reich's V-2 missile was also caught up in the so-called 'Nazi dumping' strategy which saw at least 38 people linked to Hitler's murderous regime leave the US since 1979.

Four living people are still receiving monthly checks from the U.S. government valued at around $1,500. Over a lifetime total payments could easily have reached $375,000 per person.

Death camp: Some of those the U.S. paid - and continues to pay - after they left the United States and renounced citizenship, were involved with the infamous Auschwitz death camp in Poland, where hundreds of thousands of Jews were systemically slaughtered

The practice was uncovered by a lengthy investigation by the Associated Press, which found how successive US administrations used the promise of state cash to speed up the removal of suspected criminals.

The loophole allowed officials to avoid lengthy and expensive deportation hearings, which could drag on for as long as a decade before the suspect had to leave - and ran the risk of failing completely.

But governments, usually of European nations who were lumbered with the suspects after they renounced US citizenship, objected strenuously to the process, prompting diplomatic backlashes.

The payments, underwritten by American taxpayers, flowed through a legal loophole that gave the US Justice Department leverage to persuade Nazi suspects to leave the US.

If they agreed to go, or simply fled before deportation, they could keep their Social Security, according to interviews and internal US government records.

There are at least four living beneficiaries. They include Martin Hartmann, a former SS guard at the Sachsenhausen camp in Germany, and Jakob Denzinger, who patrolled the grounds at Auschwitz.

Hartmann moved to Berlin in 2007 from Arizona just before being stripped of his US citizenship. 

Denzinger fled to Germany from Ohio in 1989 after learning denaturalization proceedings against him were underway.

He soon resettled in Croatia and now lives in a spacious apartment on the right bank of the Drava River in Osijek.

Denzinger refused to discuss the situation when questioned. His son, who lives in the U.S., confirmed his father receives Social Security payments and said he deserved them.

The other two known living beneficiaries are Peter Mueller, 90, a former guard at the Natzweiler camp in France, Wasyl Lytwyn, 93, who served in the SS.

Meuller lives in a nursing home in Worms, Germany, while Lytwyn, whose SS Trawniki unit took part in the destruction of the Jewish ghetto in Warsaw, is believed to be living in Ukraine.

The deals allowed the Justice Department's former Nazi-hunting unit, the Office of Special Investigations, to skirt lengthy deportation hearings and increased the number of Nazis expelled from the U.S.

But newly-unearthed government records  reveal heated objections from the State Department to OSI's practices.

Social Security benefits became tools, U.S. diplomatic officials said, to secure agreements in which Nazi suspects would accept the loss of citizenship and voluntarily leave the United States.

'It's absolutely outrageous that Nazi war criminals are continuing to receive Social Security benefits when they have been outlawed from our country for many, many, many years,' said Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat congresswoman and  member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

She said she now plans to introduce legislation to close the loophole.

Since 1979, the new investigation found, at least 38 of 66 suspects removed from the country kept their Social Security benefits.

Overseeing persecution: According to internal documents, the government departments involved in ridding the U.S. of Nazis saw striking the Social Security deal as preferable to drawn-out deportation battles in court

The Social Security Administration expressed outrage in 1997 over the use of benefits, the documents show, and blowback in foreign capitals reverberated at the highest levels of government.

Austrian authorities were furious upon learning after the fact about a deal made with Martin Bartesch, a former SS guard at the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria.

In 1987, Bartesch landed unannounced at Vienna's airport. Two days later, under the terms of the deal, his US citizenship was revoked.

The Romanian-born Bartesch, who had emigrated to the U.S. in 1955, was suddenly stateless and Austria's problem. Bartesch continued to receive Social Security benefits until he died in 1989.

'It was not upfront, it was not transparent, it was not a legitimate process,' said James Hergen, an assistant legal adviser at the State Department from 1982 until 2007.

'This was not the way America should behave. We should not be dumping our refuse, for lack of a better word, on friendly states.'

Neal Sher, a former OSI director, said the State Department cared more about diplomatic niceties than holding former members of Adolf Hitler's war machine accountable.

Amid the objections, the practice known as 'Nazi dumping' stopped. But the benefits loophole wasn't closed, allowing all the recipients to keep on claiming.

Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said in an emailed statement that Social Security payments never were employed to persuade Nazi suspects to depart voluntarily.

The Social Security Administration refused the AP's request for the total number of Nazi suspects who received benefits and the dollar amounts of those payments. Spokesman William 'BJ' Jarrett said the agency does not track data specific to Nazi cases.

A further barrier, Jarrett said, is that there is no exception in U.S. privacy law that 'allows us to disclose information because the individual is a Nazi war criminal or an accused Nazi war criminal.'

The department also declined to make the acting commissioner, Carolyn Colvin, or another senior agency official available for an interview.

Rabbi Marvin Hier, the founder and head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, said the loophole should be closed.

'Someone receiving an American pension could live very well in Europe or wherever they settled,' Hier said. 'We, in effect, were rewarding them. It didn't make any sense.'
