A heart doctor who secretly filmed female colleagues naked in the shower has been struck off the medical register.

Cardiologist Vivek Baliga was convicted of three charges of voyeurism after he admitted using a video camera to spy on two women.

The 33-year-old, who at the time of the case lived in Leeds, West Yorkshire, invited one doctor and her boyfriend to stay at his home.

When using his en-suite shower, the woman became suspicious about boxes against the window and she found the device recording in a box.

She reported him to the police, who examined his computer and discovered more footage.

This showed the same woman showering at her own home and another woman doctor using the toilet at her home.

Baliga, who was studying for a pHD in cardiology research, was sentenced to a three-year community order and ordered to take part in a sex offender treatment programme.

Judge Scott Wolstenholme said his behaviour was 'disgusting and despicable'.

A Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) panel said: 'The panel has concluded that your actions are fundamentally incompatible with you continuing to be a registered medical practitioner.

'The offences for which you were convicted were serious and were for your own sexual gratification.

'They were pre-meditated, repeated and carried out over a prolonged period of time.

'The panel is of the view that your actions fell far below the proper standards of conduct and the behaviour expected of a doctor.'

They said they had taken into account character references and his remorse and said there was no issue with his abilities as a doctor.
