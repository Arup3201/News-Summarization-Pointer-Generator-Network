Sam Allardyce wants to bring a psychologist to West Ham to ease the nerves of his players and stop them ‘believing their own hype’.

After he saw his side let a lead slip in defeat to Southampton before the international break, Allardyce claimed a few needed to have their 'backsides kicked' for a failure of communication on the pitch.

The 59-year-old revealed he has made his feelings known to the players and believes they may have suffered from over-confidence against Southampton after a strong showing to win 3-1 at Crystal Palace the previous weekend.

But Morgan Schneiderlin equalised for the Saints before they went on to win the game 3-1

'The expectation after that (Palace) game was high and we just didn't live up to it,' he said.

'Maybe the players were a bit too cocky. Maybe they had listened to the praise too much. The outside world is not what you should listen to if you want to be successful as a footballer.

'You can be distracted if you get too much praise and perhaps a little put off if you get criticism. They just need to stay focused on their responsibilities.'
