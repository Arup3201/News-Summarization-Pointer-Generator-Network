The woman whose terminally-ill grandchild was taunted by another mother on Facebook claimed today she is being subjected to a fresh wave of online abuse.

Rebecca Rose, of Michigan, whose grandchild Kathleen Edward is dying from Huntington's Disease and whose plight sparked a national outcry, has complained of more abuse to Trenton police.

Mrs Rose told Trenton Patch her daughter (Kathleen's aunt) 'can’t even sit outside without (being called) a retard' and she has received more nasty messages.

It follows criticism of neighbour Jennifer Petkov, known as the 'Devil of Detroit Street', who previously admitted taunting seven-year-old Kathleen.

Mrs Petkov, 33, and her husband Scott had posted a photo of the terminally ill schoolgirl on Facebook above a set of crossed bones.

Mrs Petkov was forced to move home in February and apologised for what she did after attracting international condemnation.

Now Ms Rose has given police documents showing more nasty Facebook posts that were allegedly made by the Petrov couple, reported Trenton Patch.

One post she submitted in a complaint said: 'Detroit St. Party, When that kid dies, cause boys and girls it’s to happen.'

Another post on her Facebook page said: 'Dead and gone, only a few more hours till party time, I’m going to visit a grave and take a p***.'

One post came a day before the anniversary of the death of Kathleen’s mother, Laura Edward, 24, who died from Huntington’s in June 2009.

A police report said Ms Rose was 'crying and extremely upset' by the latest messages, reported Trenton Patch.

She has served Personal Protection Orders against the Petkov couple, which say they are not allowed to communicate with her.

But police said while Ms Rose was 
writing a witness statement she said 'I can’t take it anymore' and ran 
out of the police station in tears.

Kathleen
is in the last stages of degenerative disease Huntington's and Ms Rose 
said doctors believe she may die within a year’s time.

Mrs Petkov was forced to move house in February after she was sentenced to 18 months of probation for assault and battery.

She had allegedly tried to run over a neighbour's friend with her car as she was crossing the road last October.

It is believed the nasty comments 
began over an unanswered text message relating to a party held by Ms 
Rose, reported Trenton Patch.

Ms Rose is understood to have 
received a text message when she was holding a birthday party from Mrs 
Petkov, who asked if her children could come over.

But because she did not respond to the text message fast enough, the feud is said to have begun.

The dying girl’s father Robert 
Edwards, 26, made an appeal to the Petkov family last October to leave 
them alone and make no more comments about their daughter.

‘The police told us they were shocked that we haven’t gone over there and beat the hell out of her,' he told the Detroit News at the time.

When Mrs Edwards died the Petkovs drove a pick-up truck up and down the street, adorned with a coffin and carrying the slogan 'Death Machine'.

Mrs Petkov also posted a mocked-up picture of Mrs Edward in the arms of the grim reaper at one point.

Asked why she escalated the ugly feud, Jennifer Petkov said it was for 'personal satisfaction' and 'because it burns Rebecca Rose's a** raw'.

But she later apologised after receiving international condemnation.

Kathleen’s family were contacted by dozens of people from countries including Britain and Germany after a video report of the story went viral.
