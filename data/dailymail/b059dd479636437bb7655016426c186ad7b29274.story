On the six-month anniversary of the Occupy Wall Street movement, protesters swarmed its birthplace –Zuccotti Park – again sparking the cat-and-mouse clashes between New York City police officers and demonstrators.

The sweep of the park by police just before midnight capped a day of demonstrations and marching in lower Manhattan. As of Sunday afternoon, there were 73 people were detained by police.

The clashes began around 11.30pm Saturday night as protesters began breaking the official rule of the park which forbids the use of tents in an effort to curb overnight protests.

Breaking rules: Police say that they started arresting protesters when they saw tents and sleeping bags which are both banned from the park in an effort to prevent night-long protests

Injuries: Witnesses said that police beat protesters with batons and night sticks, as this protester is taken away by ambulance

Several arrests: A bus was brought in to remove the arrested protesters

Witnesses claimed that police gave 
the protesters very little notice before police entered the park and 
forced the protesters out. Some even said that police beat the 
protesters as they detained them, though there are no official figures 
to check those claims against.

'Most of the people, they left the 
park. People who refused to leave and were staying were arrested,' said 
NYPD detective Brian Sessa.

An unused public transit bus was brought in to cart away about a dozen demonstrators in plastic handcuffs.

One female under arrest apparently suffered a seizure and had difficulty breathing. She was taken away in an ambulance to be treated.

For hours, the demonstrators had been
chanting and holding impromptu meetings in the park to celebrate the 
anniversary of the movement that has brought attention to economic 
inequality, as police mainly kept their distance.

'They
set up tents. They had sleeping bags,' Mr Sessa told the Associated Press.

Electrical boxes also were tampered with and there was evidence of 
graffiti.

Mr Sessa said 
Brookfield Properties, the park owner, sent in security to advise the 
protesters to stop pitching tents and to leave the park.

The protesters, in turn, became 
agitated with them. The company then asked the police to help them clear
out the park, the detective said.

Many protesters shouted and officers 
took out their batons after a demonstrator threw a glass bottle at the 
bus that police were using to detain protesters.

Sandra
Nurse, a member of Occupy's direct action working group, said police 
treated demonstrators roughly and made arbitrary arrests. She disputed 
the police assertion that demonstrators had broken park rules by putting
up tents or getting out sleeping bags.

'I
didn't see any sleeping bags,' she said. 'There was a banner hung 
between two trees and a tarp thrown over it ... It wasn't a tent. It was
an erect thing, if that's what you want to call it.'

She said they had reports of about 25 demonstrators arrested in the police sweep.

Protesters
reconvened at the park following afternoon marches through New York's 
financial district. By 11pm, roughly 300 had gathered there.

'People are concerned that they have no control over their own 
democracy. They have no control over their own lives. This is the beginning. This park is sacred ground for millions across the country.'

'This
is our spring offensive,' Michael Premo, 30, of New York told Reuters. 
He identified himself as a spokesman for the movement.

'People think the Occupy movement has gone away. It's important for people to see we're back.'

Inspired
by the pro-democracy Arab Spring, the Wall Street protesters targeted 
U.S. financial policies they blamed for the yawning income gap between 
rich and poor in the country, between what they called the one per cent 
and the 99 per cent.

The demonstrators set up camp in Zuccotti Park on September 17 and sparked a wave of protests across the United States.

Events got under way near midday on 
Saturday, with street theatre troupes performing and guitar players 
leading sing-alongs. Some boisterous protesters marched through the 
streets of the financial district, chanting 'bankers are gangsters' and 
cursing at police.

Peace versus police: Though the protesters have come and gone in waves since the initial stand off, Zuccotti Park has been the hub of the movement's activity within New York

As they have in past marches, 
protesters led police on a series of cat-and-mouse chases. Marchers at 
the front of the crowd would suddenly turn down narrow side streets, 
startling tourists and forcing police to send officers on motor scooters
to contain the crowd.

The movement has made headlines for its clashes with police after campsites were set up for months in cities from New York to California. The camps were eventually shut down by authorities citing zoning regulations and public health concerns.

In New York, the Occupy movement lost significant momentum in November when a pre-dawn sweep broke up the encampment at Zuccotti, although Occupy protests in Oakland, California, in January led to police firing tear gas into crowds of protesters and more than 200 were arrested.

Protester Paul Sylvester, 24, of 
Massachusetts said he was 'thrilled' to be back at the park but said he 
hoped the movement would begin to crystallize around specific goals.

'We need to be more concrete and specific,' he said.

Critics say the Occupy movement lacks direction and clear demands.

It
continues to draw celebrities, however. On Saturday night, independent 
filmmaker Michael Moore strode through the park before the police 
incursion.

'I think it's great that this movement continues to grow,' Mr Moore said. 'I think the goals are clear. People are concerned that they have no control over their own democracy. They have no control over their own lives.

'This is the beginning. This park is sacred ground for millions across the country.'

As always, the protesters focused on a variety of concerns, but for Tom Hagan, his sights were on the giants of finance.

'Wall Street did some terrible things, especially Goldman Sachs, but all of them. Everyone from the banks to the rating agencies, they all knew they were doing wrong. ... But they did it anyway. Because the money was too big,' he said.

Dressed in an outfit that might have been more appropriate for the St. Patrick's Day parade, the 61-year-old salesman wore a green shamrock cap and carried a sign asking for saintly intervention: 'St. Patrick: Drive the snakes out of Wall Street.'

Stacy Hessler held up a cardboard sign that read, 'Spring is coming,' a reference, she said, both to the Arab Spring and to the warm weather that is returning to New York City.

She said she believes the nicer weather will bring the crowds back to Occupy protests, where numbers have dwindled in recent months since the group's encampment was ousted from Zuccotti Park by authorities in November.

But now, 'more and more people are coming out,' said the 39-year-old, who left her home in Florida in October to join the Manhattan protesters and stayed through much of the winter.

'The next couple of months, things are going to start to grow, like the flowers.'

Some have questioned whether the group can regain its momentum. This month, the finance accounting group in New York City reported that just about $119,000 remained in Occupy's bank account - the equivalent of about two weeks' worth of expenses.

But Ms Hessler said the group has remained strong, and she pronounced herself satisfied with what the Occupy protesters have accomplished over the last half year.

'It's changed the language,' she said. 'It's brought out a lot of issues that people are talking about.

And that's the start of change.'
