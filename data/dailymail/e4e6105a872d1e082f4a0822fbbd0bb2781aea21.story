The estate was originally listed for $90million by owner Gabriel Brener. Brener bought the Disney Estate after Lillian Disney's death, according to its online listing.

Brener built a new home on the property in 2001, which has eight bedrooms, seventeen bathrooms, as well as two panic rooms, a gym, movie room, and wine cellar.

Though the Disney Estate no longer stands, the tunnel which housed the cartoonist's train, the 'Carolwood Pacific Railroad,' still stands, the listing notes.

Realtor 
Jay Harris of the Agency, who listed the property along with Mauricio 
Umansky, told CNNMoney Disney's train was popular with neighborhood 
children.

Disney's gate, as well as Lillian Disney's rose bushes, also remain. Harris said it's been suggested that Mickey Mouse's silhouette can be seen in the gate's metalwork if viewers look closely enough.
