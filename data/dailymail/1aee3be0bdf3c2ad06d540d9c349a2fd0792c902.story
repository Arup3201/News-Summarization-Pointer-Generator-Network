And so, after a quick blast of Jennifer Lopez at this evening’s opening ceremony, it begins.

A tournament that has been seven problematic years in the making, for a Brazilian team tasked with winning the hearts of a disillusioned nation on a journey that will take them to every corner of this vast country.

For the people of Brazil who will do their best to put their political issues to one side over the next four weeks, their hopes rest on the shoulders of two men.

Brazil coach Luis Felipe Scolari and Neymar share a joke ahead of their opening game against Croatia

Light-hearted: Scolari and Neymar put on a relaxed front ahead of the opening match of the World Cup

Please allow me to introduce to you... Neymar carries the weight of Brazil's expectations on his shoulders

Feeling confident: Luis Felipe Scolari has proclaimed the time has arrived... 'This is our World Cup'

On Luiz Felipe Scolari, the manager 
who guided their national team to World Cup glory in 2002 and has 
restored belief in a team who were stumbling towards failure before his 
return. And a young boy from the region of this huge, bustling, bonkers 
metropolis. Another son of Santos who dares to walk in the mercurial 
footsteps of Pele.

Neymar 
joined Scolari on stage at last night’s press conference and if their 
performance provided any indication of what is to follow, we are in for 
some wonderful theatre.

Scolari’s
 opening speech was Churchillian. ‘To all Brazilians I want to say the 
time has arrived,’ he declared. ‘This is our World Cup.’

Neymar picked up the theme. ‘We want to fulfil the dreams of all Brazilians, which is to win the World Cup.’

Under the spotlight: All eyes will be on the 22-year-old Barcelona forward when the tournament begins

Never
 has a Brazilian player gone into a World Cup in the position Neymar 
finds himself this evening. ‘Look at the 2002 team,’ said Rodrigo 
Mattos, a leading sports columnist here.

‘Then
 they had three great players in Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho. Not to
 mention a great captain in Cafu. Now, however, there is only Neymar, 
and he is only 22. He is still a boy, yet he has all this 
responsibility.’

Neymar is 
not shying away from it, as his decision to switch from No 11 to the 
iconic No 10 shirt last year demonstrated. He will give the shirt he 
wears tonight to his mother, he said.

If
 he scanned a copy of Diario de Sao Paulo here yesterday, he would have 
seen 12 pages of sports editorial dominated by his image. In all 20 
photographs.

Brazil admires 
Neymar for his blistering speed, not to mention the 31 goals and 22 
assists he has managed in just 49 appearances for his country. He might 
now be at Barcelona but it was at Santos that the foundations of his 
fame were built, in the 136 goals in 225 appearances he scored before 
moving to the Catalan capital. Reports of a twisted ankle last week led 
to a mood of national hysteria.

Only
 Scolari even gets close to the number of products Neymar endorses, with
 Brazil’s manager the face of supermarkets, cars and beer. But Neymar is
 the superstar.

It was the 
four goals he scored in last year’s Confederations Cup that convinced 
Brazilians that here was a player who could take this tournament by 
storm.

That event also 
convinced a pessimistic population that their national team were once 
again a force to be reckoned with. They go into this World Cup unbeaten 
at home in a competitive match since 1975.

Watch and learn: Neymar has scored 31 goals and 22 assists in just 49 appearances for his country

Marketing gold: Neymar's name has been associated with every product under the sun, including this Nike viral

No pressure then: Neymar, holding up his figurine, have not lost a home game since 1975

Scolari
 was seen as the mastermind of a triumph that concluded with a 
three-goal demolition of Spain, and it is why he too is adored. ‘Scolari
 is more popular today than in 2002,’ says Mattos. ‘He has given the 
people hope when they thought the team would do nothing prior to the 
dismissal of Mano Menezes at the end of 2012.’

One
 imagines the tragedy that befell Scolari on Tuesday will only heighten 
the desire to see him succeed. News of the death of his nephew in a car 
accident is said to have left Scolari heartbroken, so much so that 
players —David Luiz among them — went to comfort him before their 
training session at their Granja Comary base on the outskirts of Rio.

‘We
 have been through some difficult times together,’ said Scolari of his 
family last night. ‘But we know that life goes on. I find strength from 
working with these players. Even when we are feeling sad, we can forget 
sadness and feel the beauty around us.’ No wonder they call him Felipao 
(Big Phil).

The politics 
surrounding this tournament have nevertheless done the hosts no favours.
 The tournament, as the angry demonstrations have highlighted, is a 
political hot potato, the staggering expense of staging the tournament 
causing much of the anger.

Indeed,
 when Brazil was awarded the World Cup in 2007, polls suggested around 
80 per cent of Brazilians were in favour of hosting football’s greatest 
extravaganza. Now that figure is below 50 per cent.

One way of appeasing the masses has been to take the team round the country over the next month. 

Their
 journey begins here in the south-east, in Sao Paulo, then heads 
north-east, to Fortaleza, before moving to the central west area, to 
Brasilia. Only if they reach the final do they even play in Rio at the 
Maracana. But their group games alone will see them cover 2,436 miles, 
compared to Belgium’s 430 miles.

Those
 fortunate enough to witness the beginning of that journey inside the 
Arena de Sao Paulo this evening will be supporting a team built on swift
 attacks and a philosophy of high-intensity, high-pressure marking, with
 Luiz Gustavo in the role of midfield enforcer.

In
 the newspapers yesterday much of the debate was centred around the fact
 that Brazil trained on Tuesday on a small pitch to prepare for Croatia.
 Known here as ‘the Brazilians of Europe’, Croatia are respected for 
their speed and touch and Scolari thinks neat, one-touch football is the
 way to combat them.

A goal or two from Neymar would also be useful.
