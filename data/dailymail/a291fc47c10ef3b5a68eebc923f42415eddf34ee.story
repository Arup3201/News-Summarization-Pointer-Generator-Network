A 14-year-old schoolgirl and a 16-year-old boy have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a teenager was found dead at a suburban home.

Jay Benton, 18, was discovered in full cardiac arrest at the terraced property in Basingstoke, Hampshire, yesterday afternoon.

He was taken by ambulance to North Hampshire Hospital, where he was confirmed dead.

Now, Hampshire Police's major investigation team has launched an investigation into the teenager's death, codenamed Operation Plate.

Today, the teenage suspects - both from Basingstoke - were being held in police custody, where they were being quizzed by officers. 

Meanwhile, forensic officers were spotted coming in and out of the house where Jay - who has been named locally, but is yet to be formally identified by police - was found.

The property in Frescade Crescent belongs to 
taxi driver Tony Donovan and his wife Christine, 63, who was reportedly visiting her husband in hospital at the time.

Paramedics were called to the scene just after 2.10pm yesterday.

Two ambulances arrived at the house and took Jay to hospital, before police were alerted to the incident at around 2.30pm, according to spokesman for the South Central Ambulance Service.

A
 specialist Home Office pathologist has now been drafted in to conduct a 
post-mortem examination on the teenager's body to establish a cause of death.

Today, friends took to social media, including Facebook and Twitter, to pay tribute to the teenager, who studied sports science at Farnham College and worked as barista at Costa Coffee.

Stephen Cooke tweeted: 'R.I.P Jay Benton. Dying at that age is simply horrible.'

Meanwhile, another
 posted: 'Literally can’t believe it. RIP Jay Benton. I just remembered 
his cheeky grin always getting into trouble, So, so sad.'

And Amy Priestley said: 'R.I.P Jay Benton ... we had our ups and down but you still made me laugh. Sleep tight mate.'

Inquiry: Police are currently not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident

A Facebook memorial page was also set up for the teenager, on which Jade
 Dorey posted: 'Another close friend taken from me this year, so 
upsetting :'(.

'Such an 
amazing boy, still hard to believe you’re gone. Keep partying hard up 
there, my little raver, R.I.P, forever in my heart.'

Lotty Lily Price also wrote: 'He was probably the bravest 
lad i know had so much respect for him.

'Cant stop thinking your gonna 
see me and run up to me and pick me up like your normally do (sic).'

This afternoon, a neighbour - who wishes to remain unnamed - said she had heard 'no screaming' at the time of the alleged murder.

'We were here but we heard no shouts, no screams,' she said. 'There are two dogs there and we usually hear them.

'When I saw the police I just thought there had been a break-in.'

However, another neighbour told her husband she had heard a 
noise - that sounded like 'someone jumping around' - coming from the house some time before 
midday.

But the woman and her family had gone out by the time the drama erupted and only learned of the developments later.

Stanley Bird, 72, who lives in Frescade Crescent, told the Basingstoke Gazette: 'Things like this do not happen in Frescade Crescent. It is a very quiet area.

'We have all been here for 30 years or more. It’s a nice area and people do not want to move out. It’s a shock to the system.'

This afternoon, a number of teenagers turned up to the Basingstoke street to leave flowers outside the house in which Jay was discovered.

Nick Wright, 17, from Farnham, Surrey, who was spotted carrying a bouquet, described the teenager as a 'lovely guy' who was 'kind' and 'generous'.

'We forged our friendship in 2009 when I was at More House School in Frensham and he was at the nearby Farnham College,' he said.

'I haven't spoken to him for about a year but the minute I heard what happened I wanted to drive straight here and leave something.'

Police are currently not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.
