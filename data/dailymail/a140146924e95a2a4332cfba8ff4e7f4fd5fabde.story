It was the bright and bold knitwear label that rose to fame for it's often controversial advertising campaigns.

From the shocking images of a man dying of AIDS in the 1990s to 2011's offering of two world leaders kissing each other, United Colours of Benetton's campaigns over the years have been as bold as their sweaters.

But their spring/summer 13 campaign featuring nine of fashion's most iconic faces hits all the right notes.

And the stars of their colourful campaign, which was developed under the 
creative direction of Fabrica and Macs Lotti, reads like a roll call of fashion's hottest faces.

In the campaign video, which was shot in Paris, Chairman Alessandro Benetton asks the model 'ambassadors' to discuss their interpretation of colour and the label maintain that this campaign breaks new ground for the Benetton Group brand.

Chairman Alessandro Benetton said: '[The campaign] focuses on the iconic value of color – a founding value for United Colors of Benetton and once again at the centre of our aesthetics and communications – to give a powerful assertion of the identity and excellence of this brand, which holds diversity as a value, and the unity of differences as a wealth to be treasured.'

A limited edition T-shirt with images 
from the campaign will be sold online and in flagship United Colors of 
Benetton stores to raise proceeds for the UNHATE Foundation, an 
initiative created by the retailer to fight discrimination of all forms.
