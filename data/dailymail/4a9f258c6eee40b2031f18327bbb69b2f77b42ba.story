Shocking footage of a horrific attack on Wednesday near Newcastle on a bus driver has emerged

Terrified passengers witnessed the incident  unfold as the driver was punched, kicked and hit over the head with a bottle of alcohol

In the video of the attack aired on 9News, a male passenger was seen intervening and wedging himself between the 44-year-old driver and the 28-year-old to prevent more harm being caused.

But this did not stop the attacker who continued to stamp on and throw foul-mouthed abuse at the driver until he was ushered off by the good Samaritan.

It is also alleged the man ripped out the driver's two-way radio when he tried to call for assistance before hitting him over the head with a bottle of alcohol. 

The man - who was also charged with resisting arrest - appeared in court on Thursday and was denied bail by the magistrate until he was sentenced.

But it does not stop the 28-year-old man, who has pleaded to the assault, who continued his tirade

He pleaded not guilty to resisting arrest.

The arrest of the man was made possible by a witness on the Hunter Valley to Port Stephens bus who followed him to a house nearby and police were called.

Superintendent Craig Rae has condemned the attack of the driver.

'There was a bus driver who came to work, do his job, drive a bus and go home to his family,' he said.

Police are looking to speak with the passenger who came to the driver's rescue

'The bus driver asked him to get off the bus so they don’t interfere with other passengers and he’s just attacked.' 

Police are asking for the passenger who came to the rescue of the driver to come forward.

The man is thought to be Caucasian with a medium build and light brown hair.

At the time of the attack, he had on a black T-shirt with a colourful design, jeans and black thongs.
