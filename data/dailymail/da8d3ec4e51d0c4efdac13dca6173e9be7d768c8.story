A former high-flying police officer has told how her life spiraled into a hellish nightmare of drugs, prostitution and despair after she became hooked on ultra-addictive methamphetamine.

Alison Moore was a rising star in the Maui Police department, regularly teaming up with DEA officers to fly helicopter missions searching for drugs or breaking down doors to bust big-time dealers.

But every night she would return to her apartment, pull out a meth pipe and a bag of illegal drugs and smoke herself into delirium, a hopeless junkie in the grips of a deadly habit.

In a new tell-all book, Alison has revealed how her addiction got so bad she turned to prostitution and ended up lying to colleagues claiming she had ovarian cancer in order to explain her drug-ravaged her appearance.

In a frank interview with the New York Post, Alison told how she first tried meth in her mid-20s after being given a small bag of the highly-addictive drug by a fellow officer in order to file a report on.

Allison's new memoir Shards tells of her descent into drug addiction

She had just undergone an abortion after falling pregnant with twins following an affair with a married work colleague and was struggling with depression.

She told the newspaper: 'I sat in my bedroom with the blinds drawn and stared at the baggy. I was so desperate for anything to make me feel better . . . and it would just be this one time.

'I poured out a few of the clear, tiny crystals, and even though you’re supposed to smoke it, I snorted it. I felt it burn in my nostrils and my eyes teared up. But then, I felt the most amazing, ecstatic high I’d ever felt. My life felt livable; I felt happy.'

At first Alison tried to justify her drug use by buying her own supply and not stealing it from work.

Because she was so well known as a vice cop in Maui, she would fly to Honolulu once a month and get a local prostitute to take her to a dealer.

She would then walk through customs brazenly carrying the drugs in her pocket, knowing that as a police officer it would be unlikely she would be searched.

After a matter of months, Alison had spent her entire $35,000 savings on plane tickets and meth - but by now she was addicted and began stealing drugs from work, skimming small amounts from seizures.

In an attempt to cover up the devastating effect meth was having on her appearance she would wear contact lenses to hide her dilated pupils and binge on fast food and body-building supplements in a bid to keep her weight up.

But her drug use was out of control. She was using around a gram a day, regularly sneaking off to the bathroom to take a hit before returning to her desk.

Soon she had lost some 20 pounds and ended up lying to her colleagues, claiming she ovarian cancer.

Now on sick leave she fell even further into the grip of the ultra -addictive methamphetamine.

She moved in with her sister in Seattle, sitting in her bedroom smoking and injecting drugs with two young infants in the other room.

Disgraced: Allison was jailed for a year after pleading guilty to 25 drug-related charges including deceiving the department, tampering with evidence, drug possession and forging doctors' notes

Soon she was turning to prostitution to feed her habit, scouring the Craigslist website to find men willing to trade drugs for sex.

Incredibly no one suspected anything. Her work colleagues even got in contact to say they had donated their sick leave so she could have as much time as she needed to beat cancer.

Referred to as ‘ice’ or ‘glass’, methylamphetamine can be consumed orally, sniffed, smoked or injected.

In its most popular crystalline form it resembles glass shavings or a crystal rock but is also available in pills and powder.

The drug is generally odourless although some forms have strong ammonia smell, because of solvents used to make it.

At low doses crystal meth boosts alertness and blocks hunger and fatigue.

Higher doses of the drug causes exhilaration and euphoria and very high doses cause agitation and paranoia.

Side effects include anxiety, emotional swings, and paranoia and there is a risk of fever, convulsions, and falling into a coma.

Death can result from burst blood vessels in the brain (triggered by spikes in blood pressure) or heart failure.

The high from the drug tends to last 4-12 hours with users continuing to take the drug for days - sometimes addicts stay awake for days, eat very little and experience a heightened state of arousal.

The drug was first synthesised in 1919 but has grown in popularity due 
to the ease with which it is produced using a number of household 
products and items.

One of her closest workmates even organised a fund-raiser to pay for the chemotherapy she was supposedly having.

But even that didn't stop her and she moved to Washington to stay with a dealer she had met on Craigslist.

After discovering she was a police officer, the dealer secretly filmed her taking drugs and having sex and blackmailed her, confiscating her badge and drivers licence so she could not escape.

She was regularly beaten and on one occasion after they had argued, he brought a group of men over to the house to gang-rape her.

Eventually she managed to escape, getting her mother to come and collect her and going into rehab. Finally off the drugs she moved back in with her mother in New Mexico.

But her past soon caught up with her and she was arrested and transported back to Maui in handcuffs and leg clamps to face 25 drug-related charges including deceiving the department, tampering with evidence, drug possession and forging doctors’ notes.

She pleaded guilty to all charges and spent a year in jail.

Now clean and living with her grandmother in Albuquerque, she works three jobs to make ends meet.

She added: 'I still have meth cravings, even though I’ve been clean for four-and-a-half years. And I have nightmares about the dealer every single night. I see a therapist three times a week, three hours a visit.

'I try not to look too far ahead into the future, but my goal is to learn how to accept myself. My biggest regret besides hurting the people that I loved so much is that I didn’t love myself.'
