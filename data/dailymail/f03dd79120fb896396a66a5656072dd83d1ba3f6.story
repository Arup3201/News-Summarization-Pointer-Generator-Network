It is set to give traditional cocktails a new twist.

An exotic species of lime is being grown in the UK for the first time - and it's bright red. 

The striking fruit, dubbed the Red Lime, is the same size and shape as the usual green variety.

However, it combines orange and sour lime flavours - making it the ideal addition to marmalade, Tequila and other drinks.

New: The unusual crop, which is native to India, is being grown in Britain for the first time

The unusual crop, which is native to India, is known by a variety of names across the world, including a rangpur, lemandarin, canton lemon, sylhet lime and limao cravo.

It is believed to have been made by crossing a lemon with a mandarin plant.

Red Lime trees are now being sold in Britain for the first time. They can be grown in a sheltered pot on a patio area or in a tub inside a conservatory.

A spokesman from Suttons Seeds in Devon -  which has a collection of Red Lime trees on sale - said: 'This is the first time the Red Lime has been introduced to the UK as a tree that can be grown.

'The peel is reddish-orange, with large oil glands that are thin and easily removed, and the pulp has a limelike aroma.

'It is a deep orange colour with eight to 10 segments having tender walls and separating readily from each other.

'It is very juicy and has a flavour like a lime crossed with marmalade orange.'

She added: 'Small, whole fruits can be 
candied or pickled, but the Red Lime is not fully appreciated until it 
is made into marmalade.

Unique: The exotic species is very different in appearance from the traditional green lime (above)

'This product is superb and rivals or excels that made from the sour orange.'

The Red Lime tree is believed to have been first recorded by Victorian botanist Sir Joseph 
Hooker, who was exploring the foot of the Himalayas, from Gurhwal to the
Khasisa Hills.

It is a very fast-growing plant and can reach up to 20ft.

The Red Lime is the latest hybrid fruit creation to hit the UK.

Last May, supermarkets took stock of the 'papple' - a mixture of a pear and an apple.

The fruit, which is native to New Zealand, is said to taste like an apple, but has the skin and texture of a pear.

And three months later, Marks and Spencer launched the ‘grango’ - a variety of grape that tastes of mango.

The unusual crop, which is known for its super sweet taste, is developed in south-east Spain.

It is believed to develop its sweetness from the country's warm climate - with the cooler temperatures at night giving it a firm mango-like texture

In 2011, a Washington-based fruit grower unveiled another variant of grape - the 'grapple' - which looks and crunches like a regular apple, but tastes like a grape.

The phenonenom for fruit tampering has even spread further afield, with Israeli horticulturalists creating a 'black galaxy' crossbreed of tomato which has almost-black skin.
