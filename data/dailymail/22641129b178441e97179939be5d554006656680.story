Pop singer Rihanna broke World Cup etiquette when she got her hands on the trophy during Germany’s post-match party.

FIFA guidelines have previously said that only winners of the tournament and heads of state are allowed to handle the official World Cup Trophy.

Indeed, England’s Wayne Rooney and Daniel Sturridge have previously been forced to observe this practice during promotional events in the UK.

But Rihanna – who had earlier lifted her top inside the Maracana during Germany’s 1-0 win over Argentina – was pictured holding the solid-gold prize and later revealed she had kissed and posed for a ‘selfie’ with the famous trophy.

Wives, girlfriends and children of the Germany players were also pictured with the trophy during the celebrations in Rio and it appears FIFA have relaxed their rules regarding the 18-carat gold prize.

Earlier in the day Rihanna posted a picture of herself and football legend Pele soon after she landed in Brazil ahead of the final.

And on Monday she tweeted: 'I touched the cup, held the cup, kissed the cup, took a selfie with the cup!!! I meeeaan...... what is YO bucket list looking like bruh?'

Match-winner Mario Gotze was one of several players pictured with Rihanna and, speaking after the victory, he said: 'It’s unbelievable. I scored but I didn’t really know what was happening.

‘A dream has become a reality and we are going to have a great party. It is absolutely sensational.

‘It wasn’t a simple tournament for me. I owe a lot to my friends and family.’

Chancellor Angela Merkel and president Joachim Gauck were also present at the post-game party.

Germany’s win was their fourth World Cup triumph and third since the current trophy was first used in 1974, when Franz Beckenbauer led the hosts to victory.

However, they will not get to keep the trophy on a permanent basis – as Brazil did with the Jules Rimet Trophy following their third success - and will instead be presented with a gold-plated replica.
