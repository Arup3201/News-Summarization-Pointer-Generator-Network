Prince Harry is coming home with a unique souvenir from his 200mile Antarctic expedition - an impressive looking ginger beard.

The 29-year-old Royal showed off his bushy facial hair during a tour of a South Pole research centre shortly before departing for the UK.

Prince Harry returns to Britain after finishing Walking With The Wounded's South Pole Allied Challenge, which saw him join a team of injured service personnel from the UK and two others from the Commonwealth and the US, for a charity trek across Antarctica.

The US team was coached by True Blood actor Alexander Skarsgård and the Commonwealth team received celebrity support from actor Dominic West.

All
 three teams arrived safely at the South Pole at 1pm GMT on Friday and 
were given a tour of the National Science Foundation's Amundsen-Scott 
South Pole station before flying back to their base camp.

The prince said: ‘I’m so proud, I’m so chuffed and I’m so privileged to be here with all these guys and girls.

‘I think we’ll be having a few whiskies tonight and then everyone’s looking forward to getting home. Mission success.’

Prince Harry will camp out on the South Pole before returning to the UK in time for Christmas on December 23.

The
 charity challenge had to be turned into a joint mission last weekend 
after the terrain proved so demanding organisers suspended 
the race element of the trek and grouped all the competitors together for 
safety. 

The South Pole 
Allied challenge saw three teams of servicemen – from Britain, the 
Commonwealth and the US – racing to reach the bottom of the world.

The
 teams travelled a distance of 208 miles across some of the most 
inhospitable conditions known to man, with temperatures of up to minus 
50 degrees and biting winds.

Every
 man and woman was also forced to carry a custom built arctic sledge 
known as a pulk, weighing in excess of 11 stone, carrying their kit.

It is hoped their remarkable achievement will raise £2 million for the Walking With The Wounded charity, which supports injured ex-servicemen and women.

Ed Parker, the expedition's director and co-founder of the charity, said: ‘We always knew that this wasn't going to be easy, but that is what makes the challenge so exciting.

‘Our aim was to show that, despite injury, young men and women from our armed forces can still achieve great things.

‘We came down here, determined to get 12 men and women, all injured in conflict, to the South Pole, and this is what we have done. The feeling is incredible.’
