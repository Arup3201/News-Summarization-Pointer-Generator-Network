Lots of girls want to emulate their glamorous mothers but for Amy Hoskins, following in her parent's footsteps led to disaster.

Amy, 22, from Dorking, wanted to look like her mother, Katie, after she had a boob job that boosted both her cleavage and her confidence. 

Care worker Amy said: 'I wanted to be more confident, my mum has hers done and they looked really good.'

With her mother's support, they sought a surgeon to increase Amy's cup size to a 32G.

'She did say the bigger, the better,' said Katie, speaking to Channel 5 show Botched Up Bodies who feature Amy's story in their fourth series.

At first, Amy was happy with her new look but then the implants started to move. Amy's breasts started becoming saggy and lopsided while her areolas increased in size.

She recalled: 'I noticed my aerolas started stretching, it got so big I started measuring it - it was as big as a digestive biscuit.  

'Then the implant started flipping over, sticking out and moving.'

Amy went back to the original surgeon who said he could correct the damage - but that it would cost her. As she couldn't afford it, Amy had to learn to live with her deformed breasts.

She said this had a huge impact on her self-confidence and her relationship with both her boyfriend and her mother.

'With my boyfriend, I don't like getting them out, we're not very intimate,' she said. 'I know they are disgusting, I can't wear anything, I'm embarrassed to get my body out to my boyfriend as he'll probably think I'm a freak.' 

She added: 'I get jealous of my mum all the time because she's got what I wanted. I feel embarrassed to bring my boyfriend round here because I know she will be there with hers.'

Katie said the situation made her feel upset too. 'It is horrible for me looking at Amy knowing she wanted to be like her mum. She was never insecure before and now she is most insecure person you will ever meet,' she said.

On Botched Up Bodies, Amy is sent to meet plastic surgery Patrick Mallucci in London who agrees to see if he can repair the damage done by her first boob job.

After examining her, he said: 'I agree these have dropped, they are lying very low effectively taking part of your midriff when they should be higher.'

Her breasts were smaller and more pert after the surgery and her aerolas were back to normal

He told her that if she wanted to keep an implant, it would need to be much smaller and she could also be left with some scarring.

He said: 'On Amy's petite frame, 32G breasts were fairly ridiculous and smaller neater ones will be much better for her.'  

Dr Mallucci operated on Amy at Weymouth Hospital and she was delighted by the end result.

Her breasts were smaller and more pert after the surgery and her aerolas were back to normal size. 

'They look amazing, I'm really gratetful for what Patrick's done,' she said. .Now I have a pair of boobs similar to my mums and that's what I always wanted.'
