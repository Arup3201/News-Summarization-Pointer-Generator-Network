Lt. Matt Stewart of the Joplin Police Department. said more charges are possible in the case.

'She had sent some inappropriate pictures of herself to the students,' Lt. Stewart said.

'Remember, when you take that picture and you send that and you've lost control of that, and it may go many places you didn't intend for it to go even thought you may have intended it for one person, all that one person has to do is send it out to three or four of their friends and then they send it,' he said.

Low is being held in the Joplin Municipal Jail. Charges have been forwarded to the Jasper County Prosecutor for review.
