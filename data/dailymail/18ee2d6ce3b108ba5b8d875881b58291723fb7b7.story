The dress that divided the internet with millions debating its colours has been adopted by the Salvation Army for the focus of its latest anti-domestic violence campaign.  

Why is it so hard to see black and blue? is the charity's latest advert and highlights the plight of women who are victims of domestic violence. 

Launched in South Africa today, where one in six women are the victims of abuse at home, it features a model wearing the Roman Originals dress in white and gold.

Capitalising on the garment's notoriety, the tag line reads: 'The only illusion is if you think it was her choice. One in 6 women are victims of abuse. Stop abuse against women.' 

It also carries the logo for Carehaven, a home for abused women and their children.  

Since being posted this morning the image has been shared thousands of times online.

Internet sensation: This picture of the dress sparked debate, with millions disagreeing over the colour

When aspiring singer Caitlin McNeill uploaded a photograph of a dress to her Tumblr blog, the 21-year-old thought it would do little more than serve as a source of light entertainment for friends. 

But within hours of sharing the image millions of people and the world's rich and famous were discussing its subject. 

The question on everyone's lips was: is the dress black and blue or white and gold? 

Celebrities offered their input while memes mocking the debate flurried. 

Soon #TheDress was the number one hashtag on Twitter and was being poured over by millions.  

While it was determined once and for all that the dress was indeed black and blue, the company has since produced a limited edition white and gold number. 

According to scientists the reason so many viewed the dress differently is down to genes, lighting and a person's age.

'So clever! Advertising at its best!' was how one user described it while scores of others lauded its 'powerful' message.  

'Really like this clever way @SalvationArmySA used #TheDress to send a powerful message' said Hayley Slaughter while Kara Rose described the campaign as 'clever and powerful'.  

Andrew Blakeley added: 'The best hijacking of the online culture I've seen recently. Bravo to the Salvation Army.' 

'The dress debate put to socially good use! I like a lot,' said another. 

A spokesperson for The Salvation Army said: 'The Salvation Army sees the devastating effects of domestic violence on women, men and children every day. 

'We support people who are affected in our human trafficking work, our specialist services, Lifehouses and community centres.

'We know that one in four women are victims of domestic violence in the UK: this innovative and powerful campaign by The Salvation Army in South Africa highlights that domestic violence is often overlooked by society.

'We hope this image helps people to see the true impact of this crime.'

'The dress' sparked global debate last week with millions of people arguing over the colour of its fabric. 

With celebrities Kim Kardashian, Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber among those to weigh in on what colours they saw, its manufacturer, Roman Originals, suddenly became the world's most talked about brand.

The Twitter storm began when a 21-year-old aspiring singer from Scotland posted a photograph of the garment on Tumblr after seeing her friends disagree over its colours. 

While the original dress is black and blue the company has since produced a limited edition white and gold version to meet demand.
