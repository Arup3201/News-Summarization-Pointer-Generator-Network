A family of jobless refugees who allegedly wrecked a £1.25million house paid for by the taxpayer claim they are ‘entitled’ to live there.

Manal Mahmoud and her seven children moved into the Victorian end-of-terrace home after it was given a £76,000 facelift.

But yesterday the Palestinian immigrants were branded the ‘family from hell’ by nearby residents as it emerged that they face eviction from the three-bedroom property in Fulham, West London, for their ‘appalling behaviour’.

Eviction? Manal Mahmoud moved into this upmarket Fulham 
address following a £76,000 refit - half of which was paid for by public
 money - almost three years ago but there are claims it has been 'trashed' by the family

Shortly after journalists arrived at the house the police were seen knocking on the door. It is not known why they were there

It follows complaints to police about 
anti-social behaviour at the property, where the driveway has been 
smashed up, doors are hanging off and rubbish and furniture have been 
dumped in the garden.

Although the family claim they do not 
have the money to maintain the house, they drive a Mercedes and  the 
house is fitted with expensive electronic goods including a widescreen 
plasma television and a laptop computer.

Yesterday Mrs Mahmoud, who came to 
Britain in 2000 with her husband before they split up, said she was 
living with six of her children aged between five and 17.

Her 19-year-old son Ossama is in prison for drug dealing.

She added: ‘I am entitled to live in a house like this, even if I don’t pay for it and get benefits.

‘It is fair that the Government houses us.

‘I know I have a son who makes trouble but that doesn’t mean all my children are the same.

‘Neighbours are complaining because 
the landlord rented the house to council tenants – they  don’t want a 
foreigner to live in  this street.’

Angry: A young man thought to be one of Mrs Mahmoud's sons came out of the house and swore at photographers outside

Mrs Mahmoud, who gained British citizenship in 2005, admitted that the inside of the house had not been taken care of.

Taxpayers partially footed the bill for a new kitchen and roof along with decoration costs before the family moved in three years ago.

‘I know the house doesn’t look its best,’ she said.

‘I don’t try to maintain and repair the house, I don’t fix the tiles or paint the walls.

‘I haven’t got enough money – I  only have my benefits. I don’t care if people think I am not grateful.’

Now she could face eviction after the landlord of the three-bedroom property, Sue Cummings, apparently found 
the home had been 'trashed'. 

Ms Cummings, who agreed to let council tenants live in her home in the leafy street close to the River Thames, apparently found doors missing or hanging off and walls written on.

The driveway had also been smashed up, wallpaper was off and carpet worn through, the Sun said.

Outside, the lawn was overgrown, furniture left in the front garden and rubbish and motorbike parts strewn around.

Yesterday neighbours described the Mahmouds as ‘the family from hell’. One said: ‘The place looks an absolute mess. The furniture has been out in the garden for months.’

When MailOnline called her address the family insisted they did not have any comment to make.

Meanwhile,
 Ms Cummings said she was too upset to talk about the damage to her 
home, which only had a new kitchen and roof put in in 2009.

Hammersmith and Fulham Council said it may fight to evict the family at a court hearing on Thursday.

Deputy council leader Greg Smith 
said: 'We have warned this family that they face eviction if their 
appalling behaviour does not improve.

'There is a court hearing fixed for Thursday and we are working hard to resolve this matter.'

It's not the first time plush homes lived in by benefit claimants have come under the spotlight.

In 2010 it emerged that a family of Somalian asylum seekers, including Abdi Nur, right, received a home worth £1.2m in Kensington, London, left, after saying their previous home had been in a 'poor' part of the city

In February it emerged that at least 
100 families receiving housing benefit were living in luxury homes on 
handouts that could fund £1m mortgages.

More than 30 of those families were 
being given £1,500 a week to live 'swanky' lifestyles - more than three 
times the national average wage.

Of the 100 families, 60 have their rent 
paid by the state to the value of £5,000 a month, according to the 
Department for Work and Pensions.

In 2010 it emerged that a family of Somalian asylum seekers were getting £1.2m a year to live in Kensington, west London - a short walk from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's home in Kensington Palace.

Abdi Nur, 42, an unemployed bus conductor, his wife Sayruq, 40, and their seven children moved to the three-storey home in the fashionable area of the capital after complaining that their previous home had been in a 'poor' part of the city.

In another case last year, a Somalian family moved from a house in Coventry to a £2m property in West Hampstead, north London.

Saeed Khaliiff was given £2,000 a week for the home despite having no links to the area, which has been home to George Michael, Sienna Miller, Jude Law and Helena Bonham Carter.

Meanwhile, Afghan mother of seven Toorpakai Saindi was handed £12,000 in housing benefit a month to be able to live in a £1.2million mansion in Acton, west London as there weren't enough council houses big enough.
