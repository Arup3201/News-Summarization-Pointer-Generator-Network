It has the glitz of a state-of-the-art superyacht for the ultra-rich but this £50m ferry will soon be transporting passengers between mainland England and the Channel Islands.

Condor Ferries welcomed its newest boat on Boxing Day after the high-speed vessel sailed more than 10,000 nautical miles over 22 days on its maiden voyage from Cebu, Philippines to its base in Poole, Dorset.

The Austal-built Condor 102 ferry is scheduled to officially enter service in March, when it will transport customers between Poole Harbour to the islands of Guernsey and Jersey.

It took three weeks days for Condor 102 to complete its maiden voyage from Cebu, Philippines to Poole, Dorset, where it is based

When it enters service in late March the 335-ft vessel will operate between Poole and the islands of Guernsey and Jersey

At 335ft in length, it is the first high-speed trimaran (three-hulled vessel) to operate in Northern Europe and will eventually be given an official name. 

The ferry has three seat classes, an increased capacity of nearly 900 passengers and 245 cars, and a service speed of 35 knots (approximately 40mph), although its passage time will remain unchanged.

But Condor expects this ferry to sail in considerably higher seas, meaning fewer cancellations are expected.

The Guernsey-based company said 90 per cent of all weather-related cancellations in 2013 would have been avoided with the Condor 102.

During its maiden voyage the ferry sailed across the Indian Ocean and along the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea.

From there it sailed through the Suez Canal, crossed the Mediterranean Sea and travelled up the Atlantic Ocean into UK waters.

Along the way its crew polished off 1,200 rounds of toast, 1,800 mugs of tea, 150 pints of milk, 300 pots of instant noodles and 150 tins of baked beans, in addition to 250 cartons of orange juice and 120 packs of chocolate biscuits, said Condor Ferries.

The ferry can hold nearly 250 cars as it travels at a top service speed of 35 knots (approximately 40mph) in the English Channel

Condor 102 will now undergo a period of customisation and sea trials before it goes into service in time for spring

Captain Fran Collins, executive director at Condor Ferries, told the Dorset Echo: ‘It was exciting to see her sail into the port - the crew were in great spirits.

‘They have done a fantastic job of bringing her home on schedule - everyone at Condor is very thankful for all their hard work and commitment over the last 24 days, and we hope they get home to their families soon to enjoy the rest of the festive period and to see in the New Year.’

Now that it has finally arrived at its home port the Condor 102 will undergo a period of customisation in Poole, with a full internal fit out completed by Trimline.

A series of sea trials will take place in the English Channel before the three-engine vessel enters service in late March.

Of its current fleet, Condor’s most recent addition before the 102 was the MV Commodore Clipper, which entered service in 1999 and currently sails between Portsmouth and the Channel Islands.
