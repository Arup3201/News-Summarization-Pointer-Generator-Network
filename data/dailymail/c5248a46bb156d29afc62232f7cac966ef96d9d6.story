Two Maryland men have been charged with raping a 16-year-old girl at a Johns Hopkins University fraternity party.

Chaz Haggins, 20, and Ethan Turner, 19, both of Reisterstown, were arrested on charges of rape and sexual assault stemming from the alleged attack at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon party in the early morning of November 2. 

They were being held without bail at the Baltimore City Detention Center.

Their arrests follow a report by a 16-year-old girl who told police that two men forced her to perform sex acts before they raped her at the party.

Haggins and Turner are not members of the fraternity, nor are they students at Johns Hopkins, university spokesman Dennis O'Shea said.

O'Shea said the school was pleased with the arrests and is fully cooperating with the criminal investigation. 

The university has launched its own internal investigation, he said.

The alleged attack happened at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon (pictured) party the early morning of November 2

The fraternity has been suspended pending the investigation and is working with the leadership at all campus fraternities to ensure 'the safety and well-being of attendees at their social events,' O'Shea said in a statement.

The fraternity said in a statement on its website that its national headquarters was also investigating the allegations. 

While noting the alleged attackers aren't members of the fraternity, 'any form of assault or sexual misconduct is unacceptable, and we will not tolerate actions that are inconsistent with our values,' the statement said.

No attorneys were listed for Haggins or Turner in court records. 

Johns Hopkins has been under federal investigation for its handling of sexual assault complaints.

In the spring of 2013, the university failed to promptly notify students of a rape reported at the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house. 

Students filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, and the university is one of dozens around the country being investigated for complaints over how they responded to reports of sexual assault.
