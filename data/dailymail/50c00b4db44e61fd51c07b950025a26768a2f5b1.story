Rosie the labrador was lucky to survive after impaling her head on a stick jutting up from the ground as she chased a ball.

Eileen Brown, 62, and Pete Emerton, 56, who are both retired, were walking the eight-year-old Labrador cross Sunday afternoon when Rosie got herself into the sticky situation.

Rosie was playing in a field close to the couple's home in Beverley, East Yorkshire and ran to fetch a ball.

But instead her attention was grabbed by a foot-long stick poking out of the ground and the pet playfully pounced on it.

Horrifyingly, the stick impaled her underneath her tongue and plunged down her throat.

Ms Brown, a grandmother of two, said: 'Rosie had lost sight of a ball we had thrown for her. She then noticed a long stick, which was stuck in the ground at a 45 degree angle, and pounced on it.

'I quickly realised that she was impaled on the stick so I ran to her and wrenched it out of the ground to free her.'

The couple contacted Kingston Vets and rushed her straight to their surgery in Hull.

Bit more than a twig: The stick after it was recovered from the unfortunate dog's throat

'It took us 30 minutes to drive to Hull and Rosie was obviously in a lot of pain because the stick was three inches wide and a foot long," said Eileen, who worked as a freelance writer, a part-time teacher and managed a furniture shop before she retired.

'Rosie is such a lovely natured dog and the vets couldn't believe it when she greeted them with a wagging tail.'

Vet Paul Atkinson said: 'We anaesthetised Rosie so that we could take X-rays and assess the damage.

'We operated on her immediately to remove the stick, which was over a foot long, and stitched the wound under her tongue where the stick had gone in.

'Rosie has been very lucky because she could have damaged the muscles that are responsible for swallowing and could also have had complications from infection and splinters.

'We kept her in for two days and put her on antibiotics and pain relief and she has now made a good recovery.'

Ms Brown added: 'Since the incident Rosie has made an excellent recovery. The swelling on her neck is almost gone and she's back to her old self.

'We have taken to calling her 'the black shadow' since it happened because she keeps following us everywhere. I think it has left her a little shaken and she keeps pining for us.

'She's not a young dog but she acts like a puppy and is daft as a brush. At one point it was touch and go and I just can't imagine what life would be like without her.

'My daughter, Nic, owned her from when she was a puppy but since last October she's lived with me and Pete because Nic has been really busy with work. She's part of the family and we're delighted she's made a full recovery.'

She added: 'I can't praise Kingston Vets enough. They had a team ready for us as soon as we got there and they gave us updates on Rosie's progress every couple of hours.

'They were so compassionate and if it wasn't for them, I'm not sure Rosie would have made it.'
