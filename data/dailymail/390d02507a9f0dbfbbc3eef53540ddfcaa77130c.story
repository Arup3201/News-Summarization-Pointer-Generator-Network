One man then moves behind him and allegedly uses a stun gun at the back of Matherne's neck. They then can be seen bending over him, allegedly stealing his wallet and cell phone.

The men then sped away in a Ford Explorer as their victim struggled to his feet.

Matherne was left with two swollen black eyes, a busted lip and a broken nose.

Police Chief Todd Duplantis told Fox8 that the attack appeared to be 'a crime of opportunity' and that officers worked hard to detain the suspects with 'boots on the ground and door knockings'.

A Crimestoppers tip eventually led them to the suspects.

'I'm happy cuz the guys got caught. They finally got busted,' Matherne said.

He is almost fully recovered from the terrifying ordeal and no longer bears any signs of bruising and told Fox 8 that he is 'doing a lot better', he said.

He thanked the local community who have shown extraordinary generosity since his attack.

On the mend: Matherne said he is feeling much better and thanked the community for its support

State Police gave him a bike, one business owner gave him a $500 Walmart gift card and when he went to visit the owner of the surveillance camera, the man gave him $60 for Christmas.

He told Fox that he could not be more thankful for the support and gifts he has received.

Police said they are now searching for the driver of the car the men used as a getaway vehicle.
