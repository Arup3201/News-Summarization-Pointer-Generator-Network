A baby who developed a rare condition called a hair tourniquet - where a strand of hair wrapped around her toe and cut off the blood supply - was given a morphine overdose upon arriving at hospital.

Olivia Pooley was rushed to Colchester General Hospital after her toe became infected.

Although rare, hair tourniquets are most common in babies because their mothers suffer from post-pregnancy hair loss. 

A stray hair that ends up on clothes can then wrap itself around a child's toe like 
cheese wire, cutting off the circulation.

Olivia Pooley (with father Daniel) developed a rare condition called a hair tourniquet - where a strand of hair wrapped around her toe and cut off the blood supply

Tourniquets occur when a stray hair ends up on babies mittens and clothes. This can then wrap itself around a child's toe like cheese wire, cutting off the circulation

Infections can develop as the hair cuts into the flesh as it tightens, potentially leading to amputation.

Although
most commonly seen as a 'toe touniquet', other appendages such as 
fingers, ear lobes and male genitalia can also be affected.

Olivia's parents Daniel and Christine noticed her red, swollen foot when they undressed her for bed one night.

Surgeons said they had never experienced such a severe and sore case and had to cut through the skin to break the knot. 

As they operated, nurses gave Olivia morphine, to relieve the pain.

Hair tourniquet syndrome is a rare condition that, in half of cases, affects children's toes.

The hair is wrapped around the digit by a repetitive movement of the 
body part in a confined area, such as hands in mittens or feet and legs 
in pyjamas or socks. 

Babies are particularly at risk due to the post-pregnancy hair loss their mothers experience.

Because human hair is so thin and, in the instance of colours like blonde
almost invisible to the naked eye, tourniquets can be misdiagnosed as a foreign body reaction or infection.

Infections can develop as the hair cuts into the flesh as it tightens, potentially leading to amputation.

Tourniquets are usually identified with a magnifiying glass and then cut away with small scissors.

But her parents were horrified to discover that staff had
given the 11-month-old double the recommended dose of morphine.

It took staff 45 minutes before they realised Olivia had received 4mg of the powerful painkiller, instead of 2mg.

Her father Daniel said: 'I found out they had given her the dose recommended for a 12-year-old, not a baby. 

'A doctor told us we had been lucky not to lose her.'

Staff then had to perform a lifesaving reversal procedure by injecting drugs directly into a blood vessel.

Mr Pooley, 27, said: 'Olivia’s breathing started slowing down where her lungs were too relaxed.

'It was terrifying seeing her out-for-the-count and her all wired up. The worst thing was the lack of information with no-one telling us what was happening to her.'

Olivia, who has scabs and scarring to her foot, made a full recovery after spending a day on children’s ward.

Surgeons had to cut through the skin to break the knot of hair, but accidentally gave Olivia double recommended dose of morphine, which could have killed her

Olivia, who has scabs and scarring to her foot, has now made a full recovery

Her parents, who also claim she caught gastroenteritis while at the hospital, have lodged an official complaint. 

Mr Pooley said: 'We are absolutely furious.'

Sue Barnett, deputy chief executive at Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust, said:

'We sincerely apologise for this incident and we are formally investigating what went wrong. 

'We
will be contacting Mr and Mrs Pooley by the end of next week, asking 
them to take part in that investigation so that we fully understand the 
issues involved.'
