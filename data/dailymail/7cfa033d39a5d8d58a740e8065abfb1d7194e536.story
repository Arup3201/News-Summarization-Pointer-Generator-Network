The mother whose three daughters 
and elderly parents perished in a Christmas Day fire at her 
Connecticut mansion considered putting fireplace ashes that caused the blaze outside - but decided against it and went to bed.

Just an hour later, flames ravaged the home, killing Madonna Badger's daughters, nine-year-old Lily and seven-year-old twins Grace and Sarah, and her parents, Lomer and Pauline Johnson.

In her first interview since the tragedy, Mrs Badger said the paper bag of ashes did not seem dangerous as her boyfriend, Michael Borcina, had ran his hands through them.

Pain: In a heartbreaking interview, Madonna Badger, who lost her three children and parents in a house fire on Christmas Day, said she considered taking out the deadly ashes - but went to bed

He then placed them on top of a plastic bin in a mudroom, which caught her eye as she walked up the stairs in the early hours of Christmas morning.

'I remember thinking to myself, "I should put that 
outside. I should put that outside",' Mrs Badger told the Today show. 'Then I remembered 
thinking, "No, but I watched him put his hands through it".'

An hour later, she woke up choking on smoke but did not hear fire alarms sounding, despite her belief that the home, which was undergoing renovation, was installed with smoke detectors.

'It was silent,' she said. 'It was the scariest silence.'

She climbed out of bed and crawled to the bedroom window, hoisting herself down to the floor below as she struggled to breathe.

Tears: She also recalled trying to save her daughters from the flames - and how doctors told her of their deaths

As she looked through windows, she realised she had a horrifying decision to make.

'The
windows were my mom and dad's windows,' she said. 'So I had to decide, 
"Do I go in and save them? Or do I go save my children?" And so I ran 
the other way to save my children.'

She ran to the side of the house and climbed up scafolding to get to her daughter Grace's room.

'I
opened that window and the smoke that hit me, it was just the blackest,
like an ocean,' she recalled, sobbing. 'There was twirling and there 
was embers and all kinds of stuff in it.

'I kept trying to hold my breath and put my head in. And I couldn't get in.'

Adding that she couldn't see any of the girls inside, she said: 'I'm just screaming 
for somebody to help me. It was the blackest smoke I've ever seen. If I 
could have seen them, I would have gone in.

'It's impossible to describe how it is that you can't 
go in and save your own children, but I couldn't get through that smoke.
I couldn't.'

Loss: The blaze claimed the lives of (left to right) seven-year-old twins Grace and Sarah and Lily, nine

Victims: The fire also claimed her parents, Pauline and Lomer Johnson, pictured with the three girls (all left)

She saw Borcina, whose eyes had burned shut,
running around the yard yelling for the girls and telling them to jump
to him from upper floors.

She said firefighters dragged her away from 
the home for her safety as she howled out for her girls.

'They said I had to go right away and I begged them and begged them,' she said. 'I'm yelling at them, "Where are my kids? Where are my babies?"'

Wiping away her tears, she went on: 
'Then somebody said, "Turn off the radios! Turn off the radios!" and 
then I knew that they must have - I don't know what happened. Something 
really bad.'

Badger was taken to hospital where it took three
hours for a doctor to tell her that her children had died and her 
parents probably would not survive.

'I
just couldn't believe it,' she said. She immediately called friends and
family, including her ex-husband and the children's father, Matthew 
Badger.

Dream home: The $1.7 million mansion was undergoing renovation and did not have activated fire alarms

Scene: The fire started after a bag of still smouldering fireplace embers were placed outside the home

Broken: Mrs Badger cries with her ex-husband and the girls' father, Matthew Badger (left), at their funeral. Right, she arrives at the funeral with her boyfriend Michael Borcina, who also survived the fire

'I said, "Bring 
everybody. The children are gone, my mum and dad are gone. There's been a
fire. Please come and help me". I was just so scared,' she said.

The
devastating tragedy came after Mrs Badger had enjoyed an evening at her 
$1.7 million Stamford mansion with her boyfriend, children and parents.

They
had set the table for the following day and Mrs Badger had opted for 
electric candles over ones with flames, 'to be safe', she said.

At
around 9 p.m. the girls went to bed, where Borcina read them How the 
Grinch Stole Christmas! and Mrs Badger stayed up talking to Lily and 
Sarah, who shared a bed.

She stayed up wrapping presents with Borcina, the contractor who was renovating the home, until the early hours of the morning.

Sobbing
during the interview on Today, which was previewed earlier this week, 
she said that she has struggled to come to terms with the tragedy.

Killed: Mrs Badger was faced with the agonizing decision of whether to try to save her parents (pictured) or her three daughters from the flames. She ran towards the three girls

Loving: Mrs Badger remembered her father Lomer, a mall Santa, as 'amazing' with his daughters

'The first time I smiled or the first time I laughed, I felt so bad,' she said.

Mrs
Badger added that she still has questions about the fire, which killed 
her family although she believed the fire and smoke alarms were working.

Three weeks ago, she filed a notice 
of intent to sue the City of Stamford, claiming that they had pulled 
down the home the day after the fire without her permission - destroying
crucial evidence.

Mrs 
Badger claimed that destroying the home and its contents - valued at $3 
million - prevented her from getting compensation for the 'extreme 
emotional distress and mental anguish' she suffered.

The city had deemed the large Victorian home unsafe before pulling it down.

Officials ruled the blaze started when 
Borcina placed a bag of glowing embers in a bag by the home.

Prosecutors
have decided that criminal charges will not be filed, as some 
precautions were taken at the time and, although they proved 
insufficient, they could not be considered criminal negligence.

Stamford's State Attorney David Cohen said Borcina cleaned out the 
fireplace at about 3.30 a.m., and placed the ash into a paper bag.

Family: Mrs Badger immediately called her ex-husband after a doctor told her the three girls had died

Grief: Mr Badger said his life ended the day he picked up the phone to be told of his daughters' deaths

He 
said the man smoothed the ashes with his hand to prove to Madonna there we no
live embers. They were then placed in a plastic storage box and placed inside the exterior door in the mudroom.

By
5 a.m., the home, which was undergoing renovation by Borcina's company 
and did not have its fire alarms activated, had caught ablaze.

Mrs Badger's interview comes after 
her ex-husband and the father of her daughters, Matthew Badger, spoke to
People magazine about the moment was told of their deaths on the phone.

'It ended my life,' he said. 'I'm a father, I'm a father. I [messed] up. I wasn't there to save them.'

He
said that he is overcome with grief each day. 'If I don't cry every 
day, the waves are bigger,' he said. 'If I cry every day, it is less 
dramatic. I don't think the loss is ever going away.'

Unable to return to his job as 
television commercial director, he has instead poured his efforts into 
creating and maintaining a fund in the girls' memories, the LilySarahGrace Fund.

Remembered: Mr Badger has set up a charity in the girls' names to raise money for art programs in schools

The non profit organisation works to 
bring arts education into public schools as the Badger girls, who were 
all dyslexic, loved art. It has so far raised $530,000 and funded 400 
arts projects in schools.

'This is what gets me up in the 
morning,' he said. 'I am trying to make up for what three little girls 
would have done for the planet. I think that's what my girls would have 
wanted.'

Last
month, Mr Badger filed a notice of intent to sue the city, claiming 
officials were negligent in inspecting construction work at the home.

He is accusing the city of Stamford of allowing the house to become a fire trap by failing to properly oversee construction.

His
attorney, Richard Emery, said the city failed to ensure fire alarms 
were hooked up when children were living in a residence under 
construction.
