A woman is accused of using a unique excuse to get out of settling a bill at an Oklahoma restaurant.

El Chico customer Kristi Rhines claimed she was unable to cover both her food and alcoholic beverages Friday evening, Lawton police told KSWO.

Arrested: Kristi Rhimes, who failed to pay a restaurant bill and claimed her husband Jesus Christ would do so, was arrested on fraud 

Rhines claimed to restaurant staff that Mr. Rhines would arrive and help her out - who she said was in fact Jesus Christ, the affiliate station reported.

She did not have a marriage license indicating a spouse, was arrested for fraud and taken to Lawton City Jail, KSWO said.

Capt. Craig Akard with the Lawton Police Department told MailOnline that the arrest report does not indicate that Rhines was intoxicated during the incident. 

Rhines also did not have a credit card or money on her to cover the $56.55 bill, Akard said.

As of this time, she is still inside the jail, he said.

Scene: Rhines earlier dined and drank at Lawton, Oklahoma restaurant El Chico before she said Jesus Christ was her husband
