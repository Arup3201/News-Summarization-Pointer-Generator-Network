A bride who is paralyzed from the waist down gave her wedding guests an unbelievable surprise when she walked down the aisle on the arm of her father.

Gina Giaffoglione, a former gymnast from McClelland, Iowa, was involved in a serious car crash six years ago, and doctors said she'd never be able to use her legs again.

But the 27-year-old was determined to walk down the aisle at her wedding to fiance John Springhower; and thanks to a crutch, a hidden back-brace and a year-and-a-half of grueling physical therapy and practice, she miraculously pulled it off.

Amazing feat: Gina Giaffoglione, from McClelland, Iowa, is paralyzed from the waist down. She trained for months in physical therapy to be able to walk down the aisle on the arm of her father (pictured) at her wedding

Miracle: The 27-year-old used a crutch and a back brace to 'walk', holding onto her dad Gary for support

Emotional surprise: Guests gasped and watched in awe as Gina was lifted out of her wheelchair and began walking down the aisle with her father

Gina was just 21 when she got into a car with a drunk driver, a decision that would change her life forever.

But even after the accident, she refused to let it hinder her life plans. In fact, she even continued to coach gymnastics at her father Gary's gym, making the most of her upper body strength.

So it was no surprise when she came to him to tell him that she wanted to be able to walk down the aisle on his arm at her wedding.

'I told her, whether we roll down that aisle or whether we walk down that aisle, we're gonna do this, whichever way we have to do it - it's been her dream,' her father told KETV7.

Dream come true: When she got engaged to fiance John Springhower, she told her dad that she wanted to be able to walk down the aisle on his arm at her wedding

'Obviously it's a dad's dream to have the honor to walk a daughter down the aisle,' he added, choking back tears.

So Gina spent a year and a half training in physical therapy, where she had to teach her body how to stand up straight after spending years in a wheelchair.

Then she and her father spent months practicing walking together, with Gina holding onto a crutch and wearing a brace that was designed to be hidden under her wedding dress.

'Basically my legs feel like - like when your foot wakes up from being asleep? Feels like that 24/7,' she said. 

Teamwork: 'I told her, whether we roll down that aisle or whether we walk down that aisle, we're gonna do this, whichever way we have to do it - it's been her dream,' her father said. They spent months practicing (pictured)

Like magic: 'When you can't feel anything, and you're doing something you used to do that you used to take for granted... especially having Dad on my arm, it's a floating sensation you can't even explain'

'When you can't feel anything, and you're doing something you used to do that you used to take for granted - because I did, everybody does - when you're back up and doing it, especially having Dad on my arm, it's a floating sensation you can't even explain.'

The only people who knew that Gina was planning to walk down the aisle were her family and her fiance, whose support was instrumental in helping her persevere.

'He's just that wonderful of a guy that he doesn't see the chair. He just sees me for me and forgets about how I get around,' she explained.

Shock: The only people who knew that Gina was planning to walk down the aisle were her family and her fiance

Touching moment: Gina hugged her father when the reached the end of the aisle

Upright: With support from her bridesmaids, she stood while reciting her vows, smiling brightly at John

When the wedding day came on September 18, her guests gasped and watched in awe as Gina was lifted out of her wheelchair and began walking down the aisle with her father.

With support, she stood while reciting her vows, smiling brightly at John. And when they were pronounced husband and wife, John swept her off her feet and carried her back down the aisle.

For Gina, it's not just  physical strength that helped her achieve her dreams, but also her positive attitude.

'I look at it as I might be having a bad day, but I’m HAVING a day. I’m here. I’m having a day,' she said. 

Perfect match: 'He's just that wonderful of a guy that he doesn't see the chair. He just sees me for me and forgets about how I get around,' she said of John

Husband and wifeJohn kissed his bride, causing guests to break into applause

Triumphant: Then he swept her off her feet and carried her back down the aisle, both smiling happily

'This walk down the aisle might not be what I always envisioned it would be, but we’re having a walk down the aisle. It’s happening. 

'You’re here. You’re blessed. And if I can help somebody in some way to maybe look at their life a little bit differently and be blessed to have their own day, that’s why I’m having a day in my eyes.'
