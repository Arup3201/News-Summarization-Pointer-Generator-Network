Leicester striker Andrej Kramaric has criticised the standard of Premier League refereeing following Leicester's 2-0 midweek defeat at Manchester City.

Goals from David Silva and James Milner gave the hosts victory, in a match that contained several talking bouts.

Nigel Pearson's side felt they should have been awarded two penalties during the match when Kramaric and team-mate Jeffrey Schlupp both fell under challenges during the clash at the Stadium.

And Kramaric believes Wednesday night's match isn't the first time that Foxes have had the rub of the green go against them.

'We should have been awarded two penalties against Man City, one on me and one on [Jeffrey] Schlupp,' the 23-year-old told Goal in an exclusive.

'I admit, my contact with [Joe] Hart was not a penalty, but when Fernando fouled me, it was clearly inside the box. I have to admit: I am not satisfied [with] how referees treat Leicester.'

The Croatia international has scored twice in eight appearances for Leicester since joining the club in January from Rijeka.

Despite their struggles as a team domestically, Kramaric feels he has adapted well to the demands of the Premier League - and in particular England's top-flight defender.

'I have played against many top Premier League defenders so far and I can handle every one, no one is impossible,' he added.

'I need just a little more time to get used to everything here.'
