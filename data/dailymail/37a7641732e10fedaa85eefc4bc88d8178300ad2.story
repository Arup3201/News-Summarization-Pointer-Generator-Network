Towering over the waters at 177ft, HMY Britannia once ruled the waves.

Built for playboy Prince Albert in 1893, she became a star of the international sailing scene, winning 33 of 43 prestigious races in her first year alone.

Her winning streak continued once Albert - then King Edward VII - handed the elegant racer to his son, George V.

Rule Britannia: The elegant wooden yacht HMY  Britannia, built in 1893 for playboy Prince Albert, became a sailing champion within her first year of racing

Rising up: After decades of legal battles, a construction team have almost completed an inch-by-inch replica of HMY Britannia, currently lying in Hythe, Southampton

In fact, she was so loved by George that he left instructions that she would 'follow him to the grave' - and when he died in 1936, she was stripped of her furnishings and sunk off the Isle of Wight.

Now, 78 years on, campaigners are nearing the final stages of a project to complete an an inch-perfect replica of Britannia which has been 20 years in the making.

The original Britannia remains on the sea bed somewhere off the coast of St Catherine's Deep - though her official location is a secret.

But a construction team, which has fought through a bitter legal battle to secure their rights, hopes the replica will be able to take its place alongside iconic warships HMS Victory and HMS Warror at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard.

The elaborate hull is now 'finished' - aside from a £6 million refurbishment needed to restore her guilded appearance.

Although she is currently lying at a boatyard in Hythe, near Southampton, Hampshire, project leaders say it could be on the water within 15 months.

At the cost of £1 million a year to run, she will then be taken all round the world so it can be enjoyed by charities and future generations. 

Royal favourite: Queen Victoria's notorious party-boy son Prince Albert (left) and his son George (right) adored Britannia, spending most of their year on board

Beloved: King George V (centre) loved the 177ft yacht so much that he ordered for her to 'follow him to the grave' when he died in 1936. She was sunk off the Isle of Wight

Star: The yacht, pictured dwarfing the Bernera, won 33 of her first 43 prestigious races, becoming one of the most successful racers in the world of sailing

Design: The interior was cutting-edge Art Déco, with state-of-the-art architecture to host parties and guests for the royals

The project  started in 1994 when Norwegian entrepreneur Sigurd Coates gained the Queen's blessing to build a replica of her great-grandfather's yacht.

Mr Coates bought a shipyard in Archangel, Russia, and assembled a team of top boat builders and designers to build the boat using the original plans.

The hull of the yacht was finished but the project ran into trouble in the late 1990s when he sold the shipyard to free up funds and the new owners laid claim to Britannia.

A lengthy court battle ensued and by the time Mr Coates got the boat back to Norway his funds - along with his love for the project - had dried up.

In 2011 a British company called K1 Britannia came to the rescue and invested enough to keep the project alive and the yacht was transported to Cowes on the Isle of Wight before being moved to a temporary base at Hythe.

A look inside: Workers have managed to reconstruct the interior - and have appealed for collectors to source the furnishings that were saved before she was sunk

Large scale: The hull is supposedly 'finished' but will still require a £6 million refurbishment before it can sail the seas - at the cost of £1 million a year

It is hoped the yacht will go on to join iconic warships HMS Victory and HMS Warrior at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard where the final refit will be carried out.

The £8 million needed to complete the build will pay for the vast interior of the yacht to be fitted out in period decor to the highest quality.

It will also fund the building of a lead keel, sails made from traditional cloth, and a huge 153ft, three-tonne silver spruce mast which will be the biggest single wooden mast in the world.

The trust is also appealing for fixtures and fittings that adorned the original yacht which were saved before it was sunk to be donated.

They are in the process of shipping an original corner cupboard from Britannia from France while Ken Beken, a marine photographer, has the original medicine chest.

First crew: This is the first crew in 1893 who brought the King international glory. It is hoped she will be able to sail with similar success in the years to come

Dream: The dream is for the new Britannia to be based in Cowes, Isle of Wight, near to the secret location where the remains of the original lie

Jo Macaulay, from K1 Britannia, said: 'The dream is for Britannia to be a working yacht that upholds the prestige and values of the King's original.

'We have had to strip her down to her bare hull and start again.

'We've been in talks with the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard and the hope is that we can move Britannia there once funds are in place. It would be a perfect home for her rebuild among the most important vessels in Britain's heritage.

'Once finished her long-term home will be in Cowes.

'We need to raise about eight million pounds. The boat itself will cost around six million pounds but then it will cost around 1.5 million pounds a year to run.

'It's a mammoth task but one that we are passionate about succeeding in. The whole point of the project is to create something historic that can be used and enjoyed by charities all over the world.

'Britannia is one of the best known and most loved yachts ever to have been built and through this replica her legacy will continue.'

Britannia, a J-class yacht, gave its name to Queen Elizabeth II's famous motor yacht Britannia, however the two differ greatly. The Queen's yacht Britannia is 412ft long and is powered by a 12,000hp steam turbine.

It was built in 1953 and in service from 1954 to 1997. It was turned into a floating museum is now berthed in Edinburgh.
