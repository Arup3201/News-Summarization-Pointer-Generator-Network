Newcastle owner Mike Ashley’s decision to scrap free match tickets for staff extends to manager Alan Pardew and his players, Sportsmail understands.

The billionaire angered the club’s coaching staff after withdrawing their complimentary ticket allocation at the weekend.

Pardew’s No 2 John Carver, former England international Steve Stone and goalkeeping coach Andy Woodman are among those who are now being forced to pay for match tickets.

Senior members of the backroom team would be given four seats each for games in a private box at St James’ Park, but Ashley has now taken away their allowance on the eve of the new season.

Long-serving kit men and administrative staff have also seen their two-ticket privilege removed, as have Newcastle's players.

It has left a feeling of resentment towards the owner behind the scenes at the club. In protest, staff refused to accept free tickets for Sunday’s pre-season friendly with Real Sociedad.

The club made no comment when contacted about the matter.
