The FBI has found an underground bunker east of Seattle believed to have been used by a bank robber who spent nearly five years on the run before he was arrested last summer.

Bradley Robinett, 46, is one of America's most notorious criminals, and featured in an episode of the TV program America's Most Wanted in 2011. 

In addition to robbery and car theft, he was convicted of the unlawful possession of a machine gun, and served seven years in prison before escaping in 2009.

A former Marine, expert survivalist and woodsman, he is known for hiding in makeshift shelters and bunkers in the forest and burying large stashes of weapons.

FBI spokeswoman Ayn Dietrich-Williams confirmed that investigators hauled 'between 15 and 20' large, sealed bins, which officers are meticulously investigating in the search for further clues.

The cramped bunker, which is accessed by a concealed hatch and is eight feet wide and ten feet long, was equipped with a rudimentary bed, plastic bags, and a storage area filled with soda. 

It also contained a pair of sneakers, and there were unconfirmed reports that jewelry and weapons were found.

Local reporters expressed shock at the discovery, as the hideout is located just five minutes' hike from the busy Monterre residential complex, on the shores of Lake Sammamish.

The bunker is scheduled for demolition once the forensic team has concluded its investigations.   

Court documents reveal that Robinett led FBI agents  to the bunker as part of a plea agreement, the Seattle Times reported. The FBI has said that Robinett identified a further two bunkers that have not yet been investigated.

Agents also appealed to the public for help in finding Robinett's other bunkers and hidden caches of weapons.

Robinett's life of crime began after he was dishonourably discharged from the Marines for alleged theft. In 1998, he robbed a branch of Bank of America in Tigard, Ohio, escaping with about $50,000 in cash.

He went to ground, and in 2003 managed to steal a firearm and bulletproof vest from a police patrol car in Seattle.

Later that year, he was arrested while driving a stolen car, and it was discovered that he was the main suspect in the bank robbery. He was convicted of multiple counts, including the unlawful use of firearms and possession of stolen property.

He was released from prison in 2009, and told to serve his probation at a halfway house in Seattle, Washington. However, he absconded and went on the run again.

According to the America's Most Wanted program, Robinett stole multiple car keys, copied them and replaced them, meaning that he had constant access to a number of vehicles at very short notice.

Later that year he was stopped driving a stolen car but fled on foot, eventually making his escape by paddling 10 miles across the Puget Sound, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, in a stolen kayak.

A police-issue firearm and body armour were found in the car, and matched with the items that Robinett had stolen years before.  

In November 2009, Robinett was once again apprehended driving a stolen vehicle by Washington State Patrol detectives at a park-and-ride facility in Bellevue, King County, Washington.

This time, he attempted to ram the patrol car. Although the trooper driving the vehicle managed to avoid the collision, Robinett was able to escape on foot, the Sammamish Review reported.

Robinett was finally captured in June 2014 by police tracking stolen vehicles in Hillsboro, Oregon. 

According to the Seattle Times, he pleaded guilty in January to multiple federal charges, including interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle, being a felon in possession of a firearm and escape.

It is understood that Robinett led the FBI to the bunker as part of a plea bargain. His attorneys have agreed with prosecutors that he should serve a sentence of between 12 and 14 years.

Robinett is due to be sentenced on 4 May by US District Judge James Robart.
