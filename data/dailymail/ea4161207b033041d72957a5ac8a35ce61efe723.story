Real Sociedad's trip to La Coruna to play Deportivo was not going to be the big fixture of a weekend in which Barcelona entertain Sevilla but David Moyes has changed all that.

The former Manchester United manager has looked back in his element this week taking training at Real Sociedad's Zubieta training ground and his arrival has turned the spotlight on Deportivo's Riazor stadium this weekend.

With Erik Bretos, as his full-time bilingual shadow, Moyes has taken training all week barking orders in English with Bretos, a 25-year-old former journalism graduate and youth football coach translating when necessary.

Imanol Alguacil has assisted Moyes having stepped up from the B-team where he was also assistant coach. 

And Moyes has already taken his first big decision by insisting that Real Sociedad B-team manager Asier Santana, who took charge of the first team as caretaker boss for one game after Moyes' predecessor Jagoba Arrasate was sacked, remains part of his team.

Santana managed the team to a victory over champions Atletico Madrid in his only game in charge and he has impressed Moyes to the point where he will be alongside him on the touchline on Saturday.

Real are 15th but there are 27 games left of this season and they have already beaten Real Madrid at home, as well as that win over Atletico Madrid, so there is plenty of room for optimism. 

Moyes also has Carlos Vela back from scoring twice against Holland on international duty. 

He returned to training on Wednesday afternoon and should start tomorrow in search of his 50th goal in his 140th game for the club having had a suspension lifted after being wrongly accused of diving to win a penalty in the team's last game.

'I like to play football that people enjoy watching,' Moyes said at his presentation. 'But most importantly I want to win.' 

That went down well among fans of a club who have seen their side play attractive football across the last two seasons but fail to turn the performances into points.

Moyes' style will suit the Basques according to former West Brom player Zigor Aranalde, who also played at Albacete and so knows both leagues well.

He said: 'If there is one place where the British roots of football in Spain have endured it is in the Basque country.'

Another veteran of both leagues, former Wrexham, Crewe and Real Sociedad striker Juan Ugarte added: 'It's another style of football here but Moyes is a good enough coach to handle that; just look at what he achieved at Everton.'

But with the finishing touches being put to the plans ahead of his first game in charge, Moyes is now looking forward to a new beginning.

'I have enjoyed working this week with the players, they seem very open to what I want from them. The vibrations are good and I'm anxious to get started,' he said.
