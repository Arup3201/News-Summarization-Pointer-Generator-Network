Republican Colorado State Senate candidate Jaxine Bubis is under fire from her constituents after being unmasked as the anonymous author of X-rated novels for the silver-haired set.

But Salon reports that Bubis, who is vying to represent the GOP in a recall election against Democrat John Morse,  is just the latest example of the 'gran-lit' movement that is taking the literary establishment by storm.

Describing herself as a 'grammy who writes erotic stories', Bubis has penned Beantown Heat and several other books under the pseudonym 'Jaxine Daniels' over the past decade.

'What the publishing industry has failed
to understand is that us grans are becoming a massive market,' writes 
Hilary Boyd, author of the bestselling book Thursdays in the Park that is credited with starting the trend.

'The romance market has been cornered by those books with pastel covers and loopy writing, which tell about women in their thirties with large buggies and small kids having a lot of sex, - usually with someone inappropriate - and even more shopping,' she writes on Gransnet.

'We're not in a hurry to shuffle off – like previous granny generations did - into a sexless and romance-less old age.'

And unlike 50 Shades of Grey's fantastical plot line about a billionaire and a student, these grannies keep it real.

Living well: The Golden Girls paved the way by showing seniors enjoying active sex lives

Within the last year, 80-year-old 'mother of masturbation'  Betty Dodson has released My Romantic Love 
Wars: A Sexual Memoir and Cheryl Cohen Greene wrote about her work a 
sex surrogate in An Intimate Life.

Author Joan Price, 69, penned nonfiction 
senior sex-help books before creating Ageless Erotica, a collection of sexy stories that focus on seniors.

She set a minimum age of 50 for contributors to the book.

'Youth-oriented erotica doesn’t offend me in the least, but I have trouble relating to it—the instant arousal, instant lubrication, instant erections, instant orgasms. I know erotica is fantasy—but my fantasies have nothing to do with recapturing my youth,' she tells Salon writer Rachel Kramer Bussel.

The stories feature late-in-life lesbians, a lover with Alzheimers who is 'never bored' and a wife buying her husband a session with a dominatrix - who had to put kneepads down for his arthritis.

Price explains that the stories show 'how to overcome the barriers of aging to have exhilarating and steamy sex'.

She adds: 'Sex can change when you reach a certain age but it shouldn't stop.'
