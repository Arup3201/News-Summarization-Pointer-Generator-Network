Alex Song will come up against his idol Steven Gerrard on Saturday - having first met the Liverpool skipper as an awe-struck child.

Former Arsenal midfielder Song is in line to make his full West Ham debut, and is likely to spend the afternoon looking to keep Gerrard, the man he believes is Liverpool's greatest ever player, as quiet as possible.

Having made his Hammers bow in Monday night's 2-2 draw at Hull, the 27-year-old Cameroon international is once again looking forward to locking horns with the former England captain.

'It's not just focused on one player but I think Gerrard is the best player I've seen in a Liverpool shirt for me. It's my own opinion,' said Song, who is on loan from Barcelona.

'I have played against him a lot and every time I play against him, I have thought, 'Today will be very hard'.

'He has achieved a lot of things at Liverpool and is still only 34 years old. But he is still good enough to play - he can play maybe till he's 40. When I see him run, he is a very good example to the young players coming through.

'I think it is very important to have those kind of loyal players who play for Liverpool for a long time. It is a very different team when Gerrard is not in it.

'I like Stevie's style and the way he plays. When you are a midfielder, you try to watch other midfielders and how they play. For me, he is a great player - one of the best.

'I always try to watch the best players in my position and try to learn. Gerrard is one of the players I was watching when I was young.'

Song's respect for Gerrard is well-rooted after he first met him during a trip to England to visit his cousin Rigobert Song, who was at Liverpool at the time.

He said: 'I remember the first time I played against Liverpool was unbelievable. The first time I went to England was 1999 when I was watching Rigobert play. It was crazy because I took some pictures with the players - I was 12 years old.

'Then Rigobert gave me Gerrard's shirt from that day and I have kept it. I was training every single day in it and then when I played at Anfield it it was against Gerrard, (Michael) Owen and (Robbie) Fowler - I never forgot this in my life.

'That day, I still have the picture I took with Fowler, and I was looking before the game to say their life was crazy and now I'm playing against them. That is a very good thing.

'I have still got the shirt. When you are young and someone gives you a shirt, you have to keep it.'

West Ham boss Sam Allardyce will be hoping Song is not in awe of Gerrard on Saturday as he looks to prevent the Liverpool skipper having the same impact he did in the corresponding fixture last season.

Gerrard scored two penalties either side of a Guy Demel goal to earn a 2-1 win for Brendan Rodgers' side - their ninth successive victory in what proved to ultimately be an unsuccessful push for the Barclays Premier League title.
