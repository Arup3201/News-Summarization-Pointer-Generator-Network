Football League assistant referee Michael D'aguilar was sent tumbling to the floor after he collided with Norwich's Josh Murphy.

D'aguilar appeared to be in discomfort after the Norwich knocked the linesman over following a challenge by Wigan's Maynor Figueroa.

Figueroa made a perfectly-timed challenge to stop Murphy from racing down the wing during the Championship match at the DW Stadium.

However D'aguilar was unable to evade the two players which led to the assistant referee dropping his flag and rolling on the ground before getting back on to his feet.

D'aguilar found the funny side of the incident during the Championship clash as he had a smile on his face while fans were cheering from the stands.

Referee Olivier Langford and Norwich midfielder Jonny Howson, who scored the only goal of the match in the fifth minute, made sure D'aguilar was OK after the collision.
