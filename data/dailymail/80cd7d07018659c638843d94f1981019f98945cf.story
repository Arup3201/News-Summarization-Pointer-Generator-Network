Men are often heard complaining that women spend far too much on shoes, but now they have succumbed to the temptation themselves.

They have become so fashion-conscious that they are spending even more money on shoes than women.

Younger men in particular are investing in must-have shoes, ahead of women by 15 per cent in the 16-to-24 year-old age group. 

Battle of the sexes: Men have overtaken women on shoe-spending, investing in a few expensive pairs every year and digging deep in their pockets for their favourite brands

Fashion inspiration: Despite complaints about women like Carrie Bradshaw from Sex and the City spending huge amounts on must-have shoes, men can no longer resist joining in themselves

All age groups of younger men have overtaken women in the spending stakes, according to market researchers Mintel.

However, men over 45 still show little interest in digging deep in their pockets for fashionable shoes, making do with old pairs they already own.

When it comes to quantity over quality though, women are still leading the way.

They buy four more pairs a year on average but they will be cheaper pumps and flats, while men invest in a few choice pairs of high-quality work shoes and designer trainers. Leading the way for number of shoes bought every year are women in the north-west of England.

Across Britain we now spend £8.7billion on footwear a year, up 5 per cent on last year.

Men in the north-west and in London are the most concerned with buying their favourite brands, willing to spend even more for a pair of shoes they covet.

Labels such as Converse, Vans and Toms have done particulary well out of discerning male customers this year.

They have become important as a way of updating outfits as consumers are going for eye-catching footwear to give their clothes a fashionable edge.

A thing of the past?: Men making do with battered old shoes is becoming a distant memory as under 45s are increasingly fashion-conscious

For women, styles such as studs, spikes and and tassels have proved particularly popular.

It is not just shoes that men are coming
round to either, the whole shopping experience is appealing to male 
customers more than ever.

Clothes shopping has become a more common male activity, up five per cent on last year.

However, it is not all luxurious spending in these difficult financial times.

Spending on repairs have risen 31 per cent as men and women take more trips to the cobblers to make those treasured shoes last as long as possible.
