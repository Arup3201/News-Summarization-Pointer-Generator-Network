A man has had to explain himself to police after he let a 10 year old girl get behind the wheel of his powerful car, describing his actions as the result of a 'brain fart'.

The New Zealand Herald said police stopped a Ford Falcon in Forbury road at Dunedin, on New Zealand's South Island, at around 9pm on Saturday night after it was seen driving erratically.

Police then discovered that a 10 year girl was driving the vehicle.

A Dunedin man, believed to be unrelated to the child and the owner of the vehicle was sitting in the front passenger seat.

While it's believed the man told police that's how he learned to drive, police failed to see his actions as responsible.

Senior Sergeant Dave Scott said it was lucky the outcome wasn't worse due to wet roads and fading light.

'In a big powerful car and with a 10-year-old driver you would have to wonder what he was thinking,' Mr Scott told the New Zealand Herald.

'The man was not intoxicated and his actions were a result of a 'brain fart'.'

Police said there was also another 10 year old in the back seat of the vehicle and both children were returned to their parents,

The man was served with an infringement notice for aiding and abetting an unlicensed driver.

Police will consider if further action is appropriate.
