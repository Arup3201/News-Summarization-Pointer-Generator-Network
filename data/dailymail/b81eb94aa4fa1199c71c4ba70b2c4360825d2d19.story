Just an hour’s drive from  London and under the flight path of a major airport, it hardly seems the spot for a pastoral idyll.

But if you are looking for the best quality of life away from the rat race, the little-known district of Uttlesford in Essex has just topped a survey of the best rural places to live.

Despite its biggest claim to fame being that it is the home of Stansted, the area has just beaten 118 other non-metropolitan regions in Britain on factors such as health, life expectancy, employment, weather, wages and school results.

Far from the crowds: The market square of Saffron Walden, a town of 14,000 people

Cottages: Towns such as Thaxted are popular destination for Londoners who want to leave the metropolis but continue to work there

And according to the report by banking giant Halifax, more than eight out of ten people in Uttlesford think ‘what they do in life is worthwhile’.

The study, which is published today, also shows that the district’s residents are comparatively wealthy, with average weekly earnings of £819 –  compared to £608 across the rest of the country.

And not surprisingly given its proximity to the capital, the employment rate is also far higher than the average for rural districts at 84 per cent, in contrast to just 74 per cent nationally.

Colourful: People living in the Essex district are comparably wealthier and live longer than those in other metropolitan areas

But homes in the local authority area – which encompasses the towns of Saffron Walden, Great Dunmow, Thaxted and the village of Elsenham – are far from cheap.

As a popular destination for Londoners who want to leave the metropolis but continue to work there, the area’s average house price is seven times higher than the salary of a typical local.

However the houses are at least bigger than most, averaging 6.4 rooms – more than anywhere else in the country, and equal to Chiltern and Rutland.

It is the first time that Uttlesford has won the top prize in Halifax’s annual research.

Claim to fame: The district is just an hour's drive from London and under the flight path of Stansted airport

But it has rarely been out of the top five, and has gradually been promoted up the table. It came fourth in 2010, third in 2011 and second in 2013.

Other places in the top ten include South Northamptonshire, Waverley in Surrey, East Hertfordshire, Rushcliffe, South Cambridgeshire and the Vale of White Horse.

Overall, the best places to live are dominated by the East of England, the East Midlands and the South East. Of the top 50 local authority districts, 12 were in the East, nine in the East Midlands and 15 in the South East. By comparison, just two were in Scotland and two were in the West Midlands.

The report defined rural districts as ones in which the majority of residents live in towns or villages, with a population of fewer than 10,000 people.

Rural areas in the South tend to be better for employment, earnings, health and weather, while the North fares better for school exam results, a lower house price to  earnings ratio, traffic flow and  less overcrowding.

However for those looking for sunshine, the Isle of Wight is the safest bet, while to avoid being burgled – and for the best chance of being happy – the Orkney Islands are the best place to be in the UK. As well as looking at rural quality of life, Halifax also compiles an annual report on the best areas to live generally, which is normally won by Hart in Hampshire.

■ The top ten rural places to live in Britain are: Uttlesford in Essex, South Northamptonshire, Waverley in Surrey, East Hertfordshire, Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire, South Cambridgeshire, Vale of White Horse in Oxfordshire,  Chiltern in Buckinghamshire,  Mid Sussex, and South Kesteven  in Lincolnshire.
