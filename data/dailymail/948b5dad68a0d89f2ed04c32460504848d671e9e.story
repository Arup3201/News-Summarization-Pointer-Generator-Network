A man has been charged with murdering his young girlfriend who died at home on Mother's Day.

Melissa Liddle, 23, was found dead at the house she shared with Anthony Ross, 24, and her two sons in South Shields, South Tyneside, on Sunday evening.

Ross was arrested on suspicion of murder and appeared before South Tyneside Magistrates' Court yesterday where no plea was taken and the case was referred to a crown court.

Officers and paramedics were called to her home at about 8.10pm on Mother's Day but she was pronounced dead at the scene.

A 48-year-old was originally arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender but police have said he faces no further action.

Miss Liddle, who had two sons aged five and seven months and was a volunteer for St John's Ambulance, has been described as a 'loving and caring person'.

Her step cousin, Nikki Keighley, 25, set up an online fundraising page to help support the family yesterday and it has already raised £3,750. 

Paramedics were called to Melissa Liddle's home at 8.10pm on Sunday but she was pronounced dead 

Ms Keighley said: 'I was speaking to my uncle and I asked him if he wouldn't mind if I set something up. 

'He is still distraught and said yes without really thinking much about it. I didn't think it would go this big.

'With the kids being so young and will need to be looked after until they are 18 I thought it was important for them to have some support.

'Hopefully this will mean they can do some nice things that will take their minds off losing their mum.

'My uncle said to me that he was proud of me for doing this because it reminded him of Melissa as this would be something that she would of done.'

She added: 'The family are so proud and they would like to thank everyone who has donated and will thank them properly at the right time.

'When something like this happens, you worry about funeral costs and buying things that the kids need.

'The donations have lifted a weight off the family's shoulders and it's one less thing for them to worry about. It's amazing how the community comes together at times like this.

'It isn't just the family who are devastated it is also other young mothers who knew her from the area. It has affected everyone.

'The family are still distraught. It's like it isn't real. They are taking each day as it comes.' 

The case was referred to Newcastle Crown Court and Ross was remanded in custody until the next hearing on March 19.
