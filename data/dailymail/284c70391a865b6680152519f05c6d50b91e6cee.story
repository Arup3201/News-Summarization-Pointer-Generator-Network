A school's 'therapy' dog has died after being left in a hot car for six hours because of a 'staff mix-up'.

Ruby the labrador was used to help lower-ability pupils at Sittingbourne Community College in Kent.

The much loved dog's owner Dave Carden, 53, a PE teacher, would drive her in and leave her in his car for another teacher to collect and take into class.

But on Tuesday - the hottest day of the year so far - she was not collected.

It has been reported she remained in the car between 8am and 2.35pm while outside temperatures rose to the 20C mark.

By the time Mr Carden spotted her, five year-old Ruby was dead, and despite rushing with his pet to the vets, there was nothing they could do to save her.

Ruby had been used at the school up to three times a week since 2010 -  to provide additional support in lessons for lower-ability pupils.

Jon Whitcombe, principal of Swale Academy Trust which runs the college, said many pupils had been devastated by the "tragic accident".

He said: 'Ruby was a much-loved member of the school community and died in what can only be described as a tragic accident.

'We've got a number of very upset pupils and staff and we're trying our best to provide the necessary support to those concerned.'

The RSPCA has launched an investigation and a spokeswoman said: 'We received calls about this incident - from members of the public rather than the police.

'We are currently looking into the matter, so cannot say more about the specific incident at present.'

Ruby was presented with a young carers' community award in 2011.
