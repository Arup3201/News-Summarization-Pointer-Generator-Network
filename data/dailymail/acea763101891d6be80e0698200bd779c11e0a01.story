One of Britain's top universities could become the first in the country to install three types of toilet for men, women and transgenders.

The 'gender neutral' loos have been requested by the student union at the University of Sussex in Brighton, in a bid to make all students feel more welcome.

But some students have labelled the idea as 'stupid', saying the committee should be spending more time discussing other issues.Â 

Potential layout? The students union wants to open three toilets which could be arranged like this with the transgender toilet on the right

Students Union communications officer Imogen Adie said: 'It's an exciting piece of work. We want to break down barriers and make university a more welcoming place for everyone.

'I think the university are really open to it. The University of Sussex is a really open community and we want people to know that. We want to make people's experience of university as easy as possible.

'We are working towards forming the first university trans-student policy and we need your help.

'To ask trans-people which identity they fit into can be painful, and yet when we have gendered toilets we ask them to do this every day.

'We'd like the university to provide more gender neutral toilets alongside single gender toilets so that all of our students are comfortable and safe on campus.'

But one third-year history student, said: 'It's stupid. Haven't the bleeding-heart brigade at the SU got anything better to discuss?

'While they're at it, why don't they build a toilet for midgets? What a waste of time.'

The student's union has also posted on Facebook, asking people to air opinions on what sort of sign they would prefer to be used.

A post on the page said: 'Some of the people on the University committee that will decide this are aware that some international students might have encountered different toilet provision at home and would like to ensure that toilets are instantly recognisable.'

A University of Sussex spokeswoman said: 'The subject has been raised by the Students' Union and the university is in discussion about it.'

In 2009, Staffordshire University introduced the first dedicated sets of transgender toilets in the country in their student night club after the idea was debated by their student council.
