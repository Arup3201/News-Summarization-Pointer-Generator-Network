The Home Counties outbreak of TB in cats was a 'wake-up call' that justifies the continued badger cull, Owen Paterson said.

The Environment Secretary announced that the controversial pilot cull of badgers in Gloucestershire and Somerset would continue this year.

But he postponed a roll-out of the pilots to other areas after an expert panel criticised the effectiveness of last-year's cull.

Mr Paterson said an outbreak of bovine tuberculosis in nine cats in Newbury, Berkshire, demonstrated the scale of the problem.

The Daily Mail revealed last week that four people caught TB from their cats last year after it was transferred from cattle, possibly via badgers.

One of the victims, 19-year-old Jessica Livings, was struck down with pneumonia and had to have emergency surgery.

Doctors believe Jessica and her mother, Claire, caught the disease from her kitten, Onyx.

Seven of the nine affected cats had bite marks and wounds which suggested the disease had been transmitted either by badgers or other cats.

Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr 
Paterson said: 'As we have seen graphically with the experience in 
Newbury, this is a disease which does transport to other species.

'It is a zoonosis [an infectious disease] which can be caught be human beings.

'In the Newbury example, it looks as though the cats had the same spoligotype as cattle.

Last month Jessica Livings, 19, revealed she had caught TB while cleaning an open wound on her pet cat, Onyx

'There is not yet a direct link with badgers, but it may be that badgers had the same type of TB.

'It just shows it is a real wake up call to us all, that this is a deadly serious disease.

'We've got to address it, not just in cattle but also in wildlife, because we want to have healthy cattle, healthy wildlife and healthy humans.' Bovine TB is a huge problem which has devastated Britain's farming industry.

The spread of the disease is thought to be accelerated by badgers, and it can also be passed to other animals including cats, rodents and deer.

Around 40 people a year catch bovine TB, usually from unpasteurised milk or from working closely with infected cows. But the Newbury outbreak was the first documented case in the world of humans catching the disease from cats.

The two pilot badger culls, in West Gloucestershire and West Somerset, will continue with improvements recommended by an independent expert panel, said Mr Paterson.

The panel's report said more and better trained marksmen were needed.

The study found that less than 48 per cent of badgers in the Somerset area were killed, and less than 39 per cent in Gloucestershire, compared to the 70 per cent which scientific research says is needed to cut TB in livestock.

It also found that a number of badgers took more than five minutes to die, others were hit but not retrieved and some were possibly missed altogether.

Mr Paterson said plans to expand the culls to ten other areas have been cancelled.

He said: 'The four year culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire are pilots and we always expected to learn lessons from them.

'It is crucial we get this right. That is why we are taking a responsible approach, accepting recommendations from experts to make the pilots better.

'Doing nothing is not an option. Bovine TB is a terrible disease which is devastating our cattle and dairy industries and causing misery for many people in rural communities.

'We need to do everything we can, as set out in our strategy, to make England TB free.' The Government and farmers insist culling is necessary to tackle the disease which saw more than 26,000 cattle slaughtered in England last year, but opponents say it is inhumane and ineffective and alternatives such as vaccination should be pursued.

Opponents of the cull were quick to criticise the decision to push on with the plans.

Shadow environment secretary Maria Eagle said Mr Paterson was declaring 'open season' on badgers.

She said: 'There is no strategy here, this is an unscientific fudge for you to try and save face.

'How can you possibly justify continuing a method of killing, free shooting, which has been found to be inhumane by the independent scientific advisors? 'You ignore scientific evidence, make a decision based on your own prejudice and then offer retrospectively to tell me and others what the policy is and expect us to agree with you.

;If you proceed as described, your culls can no longer called evidence-based policy... what you have announced now is an open season on badgers in the culling areas.' MP Tracey Crouch, a prominent Tory opponent of the cull, said the pilot culls were 'a cruel, indiscriminate and ineffective means of culling badgers'.

She told Parliament: 'The culls were an expensive failure and as a consequence bovine TB could in fact spread to areas that are currently free of the disease.' The British Veterinary Association, which supported the cull pilots, criticised Mr Paterson for failing to consult it and other interested parties.

President Robin Hargreaves said it would examine the 'concerns about the humaneness and efficacy' raised by the report before deciding its response.

He said: 'We have made it clear that we can only support badger culling if the method used is humane, safe and effective.

'That is why BVA called for controlled shooting to be tested and critically evaluated against these criteria by an independent group of experts.' But National Farmers Union president Meurig Raymond said: 'Obviously there is bitter disappointment within the farming community that we are not extending the roll-out of the culling strategy at this time.'
