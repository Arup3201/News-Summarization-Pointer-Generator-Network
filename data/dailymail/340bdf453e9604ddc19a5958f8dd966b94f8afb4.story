David Cameron is under pressure to allow billions of pounds in military spending to count toward his controversial commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid.

Senior ministers are backing plans to overhaul the rules governing what can count as aid spending, arguing that Ministry of Defence spending on things such as police training in Afghanistan and support to stabilise Libya should be included.

Defence ministers and senior officers have privately been seething at the ring-fencing of the foreign aid budget while spending on the Armed Forces is being squeezed.

Tobias Ellwood MP, the Prime Minister’s envoy to Nato, has now drawn up detailed proposals for Downing Street suggesting that there is an overwhelming case for military spending to count toward the 0.7 per cent target – set to cost £12billion this year.

‘It is immaterial who signs the cheques, but the nature of the work undertaken,’ the MP writes in a paper seen by the Daily Mail.

‘The current system (or lack thereof) inhibits some departments, notably the MoD, from claiming against millions of pounds worth of stabilisation/post-conflict activity.’

Mr Ellwood said ‘billions’ of the £29billion spent by the military in Iraq and Afghanistan should have counted toward official development assistance (ODA) commitments.

Critics of the existing international rules say it is absurd that they rule out most kinds of military expenditure. 

For example, ministers point out that when HMS Daring was despatched to deliver supplies to the victims of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines last year, the MoD was allowed to class only the cost of the ship’s fuel as foreign aid.

The MoD has already been pushing for the Department for International Development to pay when RAF transport aircraft and helicopters are used for humanitarian work, disaster relief and peacekeeping operations. 

If more defence spending on such efforts was regarded as foreign aid, Britain would much more easily meet its target of spending 0.7 per cent of national income – criticised by many Tory MPs at a time of domestic austerity.

Nato’s Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has also said allies need to modernise their armed forces and spend more on defence as Russia tries to ‘carve up’ Europe.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which monitors nations’ efforts to meet foreign aid targets, is due to meet this weekend in New York to begin work on a potential overhaul of the system.

Britain could back a move led by the Netherlands to allow more defence spending to count as aid, according to Government sources.

But Justin Forsyth of the Save The Children charity, which works in 120 countries, said he was against changing the way aid spending is measured.

‘Not every country arguing for reform is doing so because they want to maximise the impact on development spending on the poorest people,’ he added. 

It is not clear whether Mr Cameron will back the call for a fundamental shake-up.
