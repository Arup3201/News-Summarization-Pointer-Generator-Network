Bailed: Jim Davidson, pictured with his fifth wife Michelle Cotton, was arrested as part of Operation Yewtree and may now have left Britain for Dubai

Jim Davidson is in hiding today after his arrest on suspicion of sexual offences by police investigating the Jimmy Savile child abuse scandal.

The 59-year-old comedian may already have flown out of the country to Dubai after being released on bail yesterday.

He was detained at Heathrow Airport on Wednesday after landing to take part in Celebrity Big Brother, before deciding to pull out of the reality TV show.

Sources say that Mr Davidson may now have gone back to the Middle East, where he spent two weeks over Christmas.

The Met Police told MailOnline they would not discuss his bail conditions.

There is no suggestion Mr Davidson has absconded.

His home in Hampshire stands empty today, with a local parish priest the only visitor after he put a note through the door.

A neighbour later popped a note on the doorstep to ensure no milk would be delivered.

On January 2 Davidson was taken to a London police station and questioned for hours on suspicion of committing sexual offences before being released on bail until March.

He was going to be on Channel 5's Celebrity Big Brother but at the last minute they agreed to re-jig its line-up at the last minute after talks with the comedian.

'Everyone has agreed that it's for the best,' a source from the TV station said.

His solicitor said in a 
statement that the comedian ‘vigorously denies’ the allegations, which 
he said dated back about 25 years.

In October Davidson, who formerly 
hosted BBC shows Big Break and The Generation Game, publicly labelled 
the Savile investigation a ‘witch hunt’.

On his blog he wrote: ‘The Savile 
witch hunt is going a bit silly now. We all are starting to speculate 
and accuse ... even in jest. So no, I don’t know who’s next.

‘Everyone has had the nod. Everyone is
an expert. Just pick someone you don’t like and say it’s them.

'As odd 
as he was, Savile can’t defend himself. The bloke’s dead for God’s sake.
Let’s move on.’

Davidson had flown to London to give a series of interviews in advance of his appearance on 
Celebrity Big Brother. 

Several plain-clothed police officers 
spent more than four hours searching Davidson’s £1million Georgian home 
in the picturesque village of Stockbridge in Hampshire.

They left the property carrying boxes which appeared to contain plastic evidence bags and brown envelopes.

Police also arrested a 53-year-old man
at his home in Hampshire on suspicion of committing 
sexual offences.

The suspect, who is thought to be a DJ who has worked 
with Davidson, was taken to a nearby police station for questioning.

Davidson has often courted controversy by telling offensive jokes about ethnic minorities, homosexuals and the disabled.

He has divorced four times and in 2011
married his fifth wife, Michelle Cotton, 17 years his junior.

Davidson and the 53-year-old man are 
the ninth and tenth arrests made in the Savile investigation, called 
Operation Yewtree.

Detectives are working through an arrest list of 
people who could be questioned about allegations made by victims of 
Savile or others associated with him.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘A 
53-year-old man was arrested at approximately 8am at an address in 
Hampshire and taken into custody locally.

‘A 59-year-old man was arrested at approximately midday in West London and taken into custody at a London police station.’

Scotland Yard said a total of 31 allegations of rape have been made against Savile so far.

And 589 people have come forward with 
information relating to the scandal, with a total of 450 complaints 
against the BBC presenter and DJ himself, mainly alleging sexual abuse, 
police said.

Ten weeks after the launch of 
Operation Yewtree, police recorded 199 crimes in 17 force areas in which
Savile is a suspect, with 31 allegations of rape.

Others who have been arrested include 
former pop star Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr and publicist Max 
Clifford. Those three are on police bail.

The
investigation has three strands, one dealing with allegations directly 
involving Jimmy Savile, the second involving allegations against 
associates of the disgraced DJ and the third involving 'others'.

Operation Yewtree has already cost around £2million and involves a team of 30 officers.

In December a man from London in his 60s was arrested on suspicion of sexual offences.

PR guru Max Clifford was then arrested on suspicion of sexual offences but was later bailed as part of the probe.

A man aged in his 80s from Berkshire was interviewed by detectives three weeks ago.

Gary
Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr, DJ Dave Lee Travis and a man in his 
70s, reported to be former television producer Wilfred De'Ath, have been
arrested and bailed as part of the probe.

On Monday, Starr and Clifford were re-bailed to return on dates in February and March pending further inquiries.
