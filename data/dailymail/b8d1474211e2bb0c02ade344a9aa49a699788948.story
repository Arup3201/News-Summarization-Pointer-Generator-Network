Britain's first surrogate mother said she felt 'heartbroken' and 'cheated' after handing over a baby girl she gave birth to 30 years ago today to a couple she never met.

Kim Cotton was paid £6,500 to have a baby for an infertile Swedish couple on January 4, 1985, in an arrangement brokered through an American agency.

The mother-of-two agreed to become a surrogate having never met the pair and they have remained anonymous ever since, along with the daughter she conceived for them.

Mrs Cotton, 58, has admitted she was 'naive' to have entered the arrangement and described the way she was treated by the US agency as 'truly abhorrent'.

The case prompted surrogacy to be regulated in the UK, as companies were banned from brokering deals between couples and potential mothers for profit.

Mrs Cotton said: 'I always have mixed emotions on Baby Cotton's birthday. It's a funny, wistful feeling.

'I feel very cheated I never met her parents. The joy of handing a child over and seeing the joy on their faces....I had nothing. That's the sad part. There's always that regret.'

Mrs Cotton, who used her own egg to conceive the child and the sperm of a man whose wife was infertile, was forced to leave the baby in hospital after she was made a ward of court.

'It was absolutely shocking,' she said. 'It's a feeling I can't put into words. I was heart-broken.

'I put it in a box, shut it and rarely open it. Some things are too painful. I think how naive I was.'

Mrs Cotton, now a grandmother-of-five, agreed in her contract not to contact Baby Cotton after she was adopted by the couple.

She said: 'I always felt that if she wanted to find me, I'm well known enough and there is Facebook and social media. It would be lovely.

'When I signed the contact, I said I would not go chasing after her. She might not know she's a surrogate. I just don't want to rock the boat.'

Asked whether she had any regrets about the surrogacy, she replied: 'None.

'I still think it's a wonderful thing to do. She's there because of me and my sacrifice.

'Surrogacy is very empowering. It's a wonderful, fulfilling feeling to bring a life in to the world.

'You can never have regrets about achieving that.'

Mrs Cotton, who now lives in Milton Keynes with her husband Geoffrey, set up the support group Childlessness Overcome Through Surrogacy (Cots) in 1988. In 1991, she carried twins for an infertile friend.

While there have been more than 980 surrogate births in the UK, Mrs Cotton believes the £12-15,000 expenses payments for surrogate mothers is 'a pittance' and not enough to attract more volunteers to cover the current shortfall.

She has called for a more formal support network for surrogate mothers and a change to the system which currently means couples must obtain a Parental Order to be regarded as the surrogate baby's legal parents, rather than the natural mother.

'There's a massive challenge of getting people to volunteer,' she said.

'I don't know what puts people off. It may be there's a lack of knowledge.

'Three decades on, there is still such ignorance surrounding surrogacy even though the majority of IVF units now offer IVF host surrogacy treatment as normal practice.

'British law is so slow moving that it's often years behind advances in medical science. Infertility is a growing problem. People need help having children nowadays.'
