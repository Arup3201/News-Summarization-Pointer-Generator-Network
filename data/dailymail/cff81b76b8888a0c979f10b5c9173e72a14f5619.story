Prosecutors will not file charges against three Los Angeles police officers who fatally shot an unarmed, disabled veteran on live television after a car chase.

Brian Newt Beaird, a 51-year-old disabled National Guard veteran, was struck by 13 bullets in downtown Los Angeles on the night of December 13, 2013.

Local news stations carried live pictures of the high-speed police pursuit and its bloody aftermath. 

One of the people who watched Beaird go down in a hail of bullets was his father.

The City Council has approved payment of $5 million to Beaird's family to settle a federal civil rights lawsuit. 

Three police officers that shot dead unarmed veteran Brian Newt Beaird, pictured, on live TV in December 2013 will not face charges

In a letter dated January 29 obtained by The Associated Press in a public records request, prosecutors wrote that there is insufficient evidence to prove officers didn't act in self-defense or the defense of others when they killed Beaird on December 13, 2013.

The officers will be disciplined for their actions after Chief Charlie Beck determined two months ago that they had violated department rules for deadly force and their actions were not reasonable.

The officers have been assigned home pending discipline without pay, said Commander Andrew Smith, a department spokesman.

Officers Armando Corral, Leonardo Ortiz and Michael Ayala did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but have previously said that they believed that their lives were in danger.

Police chased Beaird in his Corvette for nearly an hour, claiming he had been driving erratically

The chase only came to an end when Beaird hit another car, pictured left. The driver suffered serious injuries in the crash and Beaird's car ended up spinning onto a sidewalk

The shooting followed a nearly hour-long nighttime pursuit for allegedly reckless driving that ended when the Corvette hit a car at an intersection, seriously injuring the other driver, and then spun onto a downtown sidewalk.

Beaird's father, Billy Beaird, watched live as his son, a National Guard veteran, staggered out of the Corvette, briefly raised his hands, was fatally shot multiple times in the front and back, and fell to the ground.

The district attorney's office analysis states that because of Beaird's movements, the officers lost sight of his left hand and feared he might be reaching for a weapon.

Beaird was shot 13 times and the analysis found that the three fatal gunshots were as he was falling or had fallen to the ground.

A coroner's toxicology screen found Beaird had marijuana, methamphetamine and cocaine in his system as well as an antidepressant drug, the document states.

The letter cites the chaotic and tense scene, the officers' inability to see his hand and delayed reaction time as factors that defense attorneys could cite had impacted the situation.

'Given the fact that the entire incident from Beaird exiting the car until the shooting ceased lasted less than six seconds, such defense testimony would create reasonable doubt as to whether the officers were unjustified in continuing to shoot after the suspect had turned and even fallen to the ground,' it states.

The letter notes that an administrative decision requires a lower standard of proof and that an officer's compelled statements while usable by the department for internal actions cannot be used in criminal prosecution. 

Beaird was discharged from the National Guard in 1988 after undergoing surgery for a brain tumor and needed regular medical care.

The family's attorney, Dale K. Galipo, said he was paranoid at the time of the chase.

'He couldn't understand why the police were chasing him, and he didn't know what to do," Galipo said. 'He called his family during the pursuit and asked what he should do. And they told him he should pull over ... and he said "I'm afraid" and kept going.'
