Johnny Cash's boyhood home is set to open its doors to the public on August 16, attracting up to 50,000 tourists a year.

Music aficionados already flock to the Dyess area of Arkansas to commemorate the Man in Black's death - even though there are few restaurants or country music dives to quench the thirst with a legal beer.

Now as part of a £3.3million project, the musician's simple clapboard home will welcome fans and give a glimpse into the star's childhood, which was spent with his family cultivating a small plot of land.

Cash's modest five bedroom family home is soon to open for tours - expecting 30,000-50,000 visitors annually

The  five-room farmhouse has been restored to look just as it did, with new furniture conjured up from old photographs and diaries.

The new tours are expected to boost tourism in the area, bringing in around £6million to the local economy.

'So, that, for Arkansas, is quite significant' said Ruth Hawkins, head of Arkansas State University's Heritage Sites program and at the helm of the project. 

Hidden away at the eastern edge of the state, the small town of Dyess is where Cash spent most of his formative years  until he joined the US Air Force in 1950.

Now, there are high hopes that the little farmstead – which sits at the end of a dirt track on the edge of town, at 4791 West County Road – can become as famous a tourist site as the onetime address of another American musical legend, Elvis Presley.

Presley’s flamboyant Graceland mansion sits just 50 miles from Dyess, across the River Mississippi and the Tennessee state line, in Memphis.

It attracts 600,000 visitors every year – and tourism officials in Arkansas are optimistic that the Cash family homestead can share in some of the passing trade. 

The Delta's desolation inspired many of Cash's songs such as 'Five Feet High and Rising' about the 1937 flood

The ambitious restoration goes beyond providing a glimpse into the childhood of a musical sensation, providing also an idea of how a typical colony family lived at that time.

The Cash family, with three-year-old Johnny in tow, moved to Dyess in 1935 as part of an experiment in which five hundred families were selected to settle in modest houses and cultivate 20-40 acres of swamp and forest.

'You came and you  worked the land. When the land became productive and you began to make some money off it, then you paid the government back with the idea of eventually owning your own land' Hawkins told St Louis Post-Dispatch. 

Cash's eldest daughter, the writer Rosanne Cash says of the poor Cash family: 'I don't think they would have survived without the WPA (Work Process Administration) project. There were 500 cottages, the administration building where my grandpa sold the cotton he picked and the co-op, the movie theater, the cafe and the school.'

The museum will educate about a significant part of American History, illuminating the origin of some of Cash's heartfelt songs like 'Five Feet High and Rising' about the catastrophic 1937 flood and 'Pickin' Time' on the back-breaking cotton picking process in Dyess.

The eagerly anticipated opening follows in the wake of the fourth annual Johnny Cash Music Festival with headliners Reba McEntire, Bobby Bare and Loretta Lynn - initially started as a fundraiser for the project.

Transforming the colony's theatre, now just a shell, into a tourist orientation centre, and building a caretaker home are intended as later phases to the venture.

Family, community and helping others in times of hardship and need are recurring themes in Cash's lifelong body of work - highlighting principles which are still important in the Delta today.

The project is hoping to raise the fortunes of the Dyess, where money is still scarce and much of the village has fallen into decline, with agriculture and numbers dwindling.

The Delta's desolation, however, does appear to have contributed greatly to the music of Cash, Albert King and B.B.King - spurring them on to find a way out of the heat and the hard work and proving perhaps that necessity is the mother of all invention. 

A new museum dedicated to the life of Johnny Cash is set to open in Nashville later this year.

The new museum will be situated on Nashville's main strip, Lower Broadway, 'right in the middle of the hubbub,' explained Cash's son John Carter Cash.

Rosanne Cash said of Bill Miller, the collector of Johnny Cash memorabilia who is behind the project: 'He's been an incredible supporter of my dad and one of the largest collectors of memorabilia.'

'If anybody has the whole structure to put up a museum, he does. So I have a lot of trust in him and I think it's great at this point. I think he'll do something with dignity and class that's historically important, not some kitschy thing. I'm very interested in seeing what he does.'
