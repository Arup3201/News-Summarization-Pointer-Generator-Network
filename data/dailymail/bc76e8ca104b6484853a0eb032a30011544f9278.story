With England having flown back home from Brazil after a humiliating group stage exit, fans who stayed out to enjoy the rest of the World Cup have had to find a second team.

And some have resorted to the unthinkable, supporting Germany in their quarter-final against France in Rio de Janeiro.

Three fans were at the Maracana for the last-8 clash wearing England shirts, but with German flags painted on their faces.

Loyal: England fans had to find a new team to follow for the rest of the tournament after an early exit

Blamed: Roy Hodgson's team failed to win a single game in Brazil, finishing bottom of Group D

The England fans were in no doubt who was
 to blame for their treachery, holding up a banner which said 'Look what
 you've done to us Roy'.Â 

England finished bottom of Group D after defeats to Italy and Uruguay before drawing with group winners Costa Rica.

Despite the poor performances of the Three Lions the English fans in Brazil backed Hodgson's men throughout, even once they had been eliminated from the tournament.

All over: Luis Suarez's two goals, and Italy's defeat to Costa Rica, sent Hodgson's men packing
