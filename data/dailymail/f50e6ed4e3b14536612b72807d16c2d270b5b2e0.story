Glen Johnson looks destined to leave Anfield next summer after he revealed there is no prospect of his future being resolved.

Johnson, like Steven Gerrard, can start talking to foreign clubs in 31 days about joining them on a Bosman at the end of the season. But whereas Liverpool are in talks with their captain about a new deal, Johnson’s situation is drifting.

The full back is clearly still committed to the cause — ending up with stitches in his head after diving in to score the winning goal — but has accepted that the end may be near.

Liverpool have not made any contact with him about extending his terms and Johnson, who has attracted interest from Roma, insists that he will not be pleading for a new deal.

‘I want to play for a club that wants me,’ said Johnson, who moved to Merseyside from Portsmouth for £17.5million in 2009. ‘I’ve seen some stuff that I have been offered half the money I am on. That’s not true. I haven’t been offered anything.

‘Time goes very quick. I’ve enjoyed my time here, the majority of the six years. There have been some good times, some bad times. But if I haven’t got a contract, I can’t stay. It does play on your mind but you have to be professional and do your best. I respect my team-mates more than anyone.

‘I’m not going to go crawling to anybody. They know where I am and they know the situation. There were minor talks at the end of last season but nothing that I could accept or reject.

‘I don’t worry about things that I can’t control. All I can keep doing is my job. Whatever will unfold will unfold. It’s not my business to talk to other clubs. I’m concentrating on winning for Liverpool. I want to respect my contract and that’s what I will do.’

This has not been an easy season for Johnson. With Brendan Rodgers constantly chopping and changing his defence, his form has dipped and he has lost his place in the England squad.

That has led to him becoming a target for supporters’ frustrations. There were a number of growls on Saturday when he made a mistake in the third minute. Aside from that Johnson did little wrong and followed up bravely after Rickie Lambert’s effort struck the woodwork.

‘It hurts a lot less when the ball hits the net,’ said Johnson. ‘When Rickie headed it, I thought it was going to hit the bar, so I just kept going. We fought hard and I would have been very upset if we’d only drawn. We deserved to win.’

Rodgers sprinted down the touchline and celebrated the goal with supporters. Behind him, his assistants and Liverpool’s substitutes vaulted from their seats. Rodgers reflected: ‘There was a feeling of elation, probably a mixture of relief.

‘We’ve got to make slow steps. The scrutiny was on us in a big game against a tough side but we came through it very well.’

Stoke will consider themselves unlucky. On another day Bojan Krkic would have scored rather than hitting the post.

‘There wasn’t any real momentum behind Liverpool’s play and we dealt with that quite easily,’ said Stoke manager Mark Hughes. ‘We let ourselves down. We had three or four defenders and (Johnson) reacted quicker than we did when it bounced off the bar.’
