One of Britain's most senior policemen today warned a new generation of 'Jimmy Saviles' could thrive as the UK's legal system puts too much pressure on rape victims.

Sir Peter Fahy said the UK's courts had become 'adversarial' towards men and women who suffer sexual abuse and 'exploited weaknesses in their behaviour' to blame them for their ordeals

The 53-year-old Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police also said children's homes would have to be turned into prisons and carers to become wardens to stop runaway girls going missing and falling into the hands of grooming sex gangs.

It came as Jimmy Savile’s decades of abuse could have been stopped nearly 50 years ago, a damning inquiry revealed today.

Documents show potentially vital intelligence about his sex crimes was buried in 1964 because he was a celebrity. The earliest known allegation against the DJ was discovered in a Scotland Yard Paedophile Unit ledger dating back to that year.

This afternoon Sir Peter Fahy suggested a new police national HQ should be created to deal with paedophiles operating across the country - and thereby dodge issues over police force boundaries.

Sir Peter, himself a father of four, highlighted the case of violionist Frances Andrade, 48, who committed suicide after being cross examined over her sex abuse ordeal at the hands of her former teacher at the Chethams School of Music in Manchester.

'Police forces have significantly improved the way that victims are treated but the fact is many, many victims do not come forward or if they do are reluctant to support a prosecution,' he said.

'This highlights another issue in the way our adversarial court system treats victims. Whatever other evidence is collected prosecutions for sexual offences rely hugely on the evidence of the victim.

'In a case of burglary the victim will not be blamed for leaving the front door unlocked. In sexual offences the behaviour of the victim, whether they had been drinking, any weaknesses of character how they were dressed may well be picked over at great length in the court room.

'This pressure on the victim and the way any weakness will be exploited means that prosecutors and police officers are cautious in taking cases to court'.

Sir Peter said the various investigations into the failures to to catch Saville did not address 'fundamental underlying issues' and instead looked to blame individual members of staff.

He added: 'Sexual predators will inevitably pick on vulnerable victims who often have other problems in their lives and suffer from low self-esteem'.

'We can continue to criticise individual members of staff (social workers) for individual failings but this ignores the complexity of these issues and the way that our system of criminal justice affects the victims of sexual offences.'

Today's report linked Savile with young girls at a Surrey children’s home but police failed to act on the information.

Two later allegations – from a woman who said Savile sexually assaulted her at Top of the Pops and an anonymous letter branding him a paedophile – were also buried in police files.  

These were classified as ‘sensitive’ or marked ‘restricted’ by the Metropolitan Police and so weren’t readily available to other forces and hindered the chances of Savile facing charges before his death in 2011.

Failure by police to ‘join the dots’ meant that the potential for further investigation and a prosecution of Savile was missed, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary found in its report Mistakes were Made.

Forces across Britain come under fire for ignoring Savile’s victims and in a shocking warning, HMIC said there was a ‘distinct possibility’ that police could fail to prevent a similar Savile scandal.

The Met launched Operation Yewtree into the allegations against Savile last October following an ITV documentary exposing him. Around 450 people came forward making specific claims, with 214 recorded as crimes – including 32 rapes.

But when HMIC asked the 43 police forces in England and Wales to scour their records just five allegations and two pieces of intelligence were recorded against the disgraced star during his lifetime.

Of the five allegations, one victim contacted the Met in 2003, three went to Surrey police in 2007 and one to the Sussex force in 2008.

Police intelligence was limited to the 1964 ledger entry and the record of an anonymous letter that the Met received in 1998 naming Savile as a paedophile.

The 2003 report came from a woman who said she had been assaulted by Savile in 1973, when she was 15, at a recording of Top of the Pops.

She said Savile put his hand over her bottom and when she objected he replied: ‘I thought that’s what you came here for.’

The Met Police didn’t interview Savile and marked the record ‘restricted,’ said HMIC, seemingly because of Savile’s celebrity status.

The classification was to have ‘a profound effect,’ said the HMIC, because it rendered the 2003 report ‘invisible’ to Surrey police when they carried out checks in 2007 after the three claims made to them.

The 1998 letter was marked ‘sensitive’ because of Savile’s celebrity status and because it contained allegations of blackmail and paedophilia.

It claimed that Savile had changed his phone number in Leeds because a rent boy was trying to blackmail him.

HMIC said that had Surrey police known about the letter and the 2003 complaint, their investigation would have been pursued more vigorously.

Intelligence on the letter was passed to police in Leeds but HMIC said it did not have authority to investigate the relationship between West Yorkshire Police and Savile.

The force has referred the issue of Savile’s contact with one of its former inspectors – over claims he ‘acted on behalf’ of Savile while the DJ was being investigated for sex crimes – to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

HM Inspector of Constabulary Drusilla Sharpling said: ‘The findings in this report are of deep concern, and clearly there were mistakes in how the police handled the allegations made against Savile during his lifetime.

'However, an equally profound problem is that victims felt unable to come forward and report crimes of sexual abuse. It is imperative that all those charged with protecting these victims do more to encourage reporting.’

Alan Collins, a solicitor from law firm Pannone who is representing more than 40 of Savile’s victims, said: ‘Its contents demonstrate that the police knew as far back as 1964 that there were allegations that Savile was a child abuser.

‘Over the subsequent years further opportunities to investigate Savile were lost, and this was because of the inability to join-up the dots. Consequently Savile was able to carry on regardless duping the country and the price was paid by his many victims.’
