An eagle-eyed sky watcher has spotted clouds resembling bizarre shapes like Hamlet addressing Yorick's skull - and a floating bra.

Sue Shaw, a member of the Cloud Appreciation Society, noticed the curvy cumulus when she glanced out of her window in Wooler, Northumberland.

The images, snapped by Sue last summer, are now included in a new book compiled by Gavin Pretor-Pinny, founder of the 30,000 member club.

Sue’s pictures will feature alongside images captured by cloud enthusiasts in the imaginatively-titled book, ‘Clouds That Look Like Things.’

Sue has also taken a picture of a cloud that looks like a bra floating over a St Mary’s Church in Wooler and a cloud version of the fairytale character, Pinocchio.

Sue said of the bra picture: 'I thought ‘Oo-er!’ and called my husband over and he could see it too. I joined the Cloud Appreciation Society about a year ago after I saw it mentioned on QI.'

'It’s great, you can take it as seriously as you like and I’ve learned quite a lot about the scientific side, which I wasn’t initially looking to do. But really it’s just good fun.'

Sue, who captures most of her images while walking her dog, said: 'I have the camera with me all the time. I mostly take pictures of the sky so people who see me must think I’m mad.'

Cloud Appreciation Society founder, Gavin Pretor-Pinny, who edited the new book, said: 'When I saw Sue’s bra picture, I knew it was a strong contender to be in the collection.

'Not only does it look very convincing, it is also in keeping with the lighthearted spirit of finding shapes in the clouds.'

Gavin founded the society in 2004 because he felt someone needed to ‘stand up for clouds'.

He said: 'They get a bad press in this country and yet they are one of nature’s most varied and beautiful displays.

'We may not have had the weather for it over the past few weeks, but lying on your back and finding shapes in the clouds is a wonderful aimless and carefree pastime.

'We need more of theses given this hectic and relentless pace of modern life.'

The book, which came out last month is available now in most bookshops and online.
