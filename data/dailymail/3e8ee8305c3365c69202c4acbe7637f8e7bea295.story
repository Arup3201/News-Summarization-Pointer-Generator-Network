Hollywood actress Meryl Streep launched a nine-minute tirade against Walt Disney at the glamorous National Board of Review dinner in New York City on Tuesday.

Streep was at the event to honor Emma Thompson for her portrayal of Mary Poppins’ creator, PL Travers in the Disney film, Saving Mr Banks.

She said of her good chum: ‘Not only is she not irascible, she’s practically a saint. There’s something so consoling about that old trope, but Emma makes you want to kill yourself, because she’s a beautiful artist, she’s a writer, she’s a thinker, she’s a living, acting conscience.’

Scathing remarks: Actress Meryl Streep called Walt Disney a 'gender bigot' and 'anti-Semitic' in her speech on Tuesday. But she also praised her friend and fellow actress, Emma Thompson, as a 'beautiful artist'

We think the Brits are brittleThey think that we are mushThey are more sentimental, though we do tend to gushVolcanoes of emotion, concealed beneath that lipWhere we are prone to guzzle, they tip the cup and sipBut when eruption rumbles from nowhere, near the brain, it’s seismicGranite crumblesThe heart more flows like rainLike lavaAll that feeling melts downLike Oscar goldAnd Emma leaves us reelingA knockout, truth be told

The veteran film actress had even written a poem for Thompson entitled, An Ode to Emma, Or What Emma is Owed, according to Variety.

But in between all the good words, she managed to direct a few scathing ones at Walt Disney, who she called a ‘hideous anti-Semite’ who ‘formed and supported an anti-Semitic industry lobby. And he was certainly, on the evidence of his company’s policies, a gender bigot’.

Streep read a letter that his company wrote in 1938 to an aspiring female animator. It included the line, ‘Women do not do any of the creative work in connection with preparing the cartoons for the screen, as that task is performed entirely by young men.’

‘Some of his associates reported that Walt Disney didn’t really like women,’ Streep said, quoting esteemed animator Ward Kimball on his old boss: ‘He didn’t trust women or cats.’

However, she softened the blow by adding that ‘there is a piece of received wisdom that says that the most creative people are often odd, or irritating, eccentric, damaged, difficult. That along with enormous creativity come certain deficits in humanity or decency.’

‘We are familiar with this trope in our business: Mozart, Van Gogh, Tarantino, Eminem,’ Streep added.

Tuesday’s
 event is seen as a big pre-game to the Golden Globes and the biggest 
movie event until the Hollywood Foreign Press Association’s gala on 
Sunday.

This year’s 
list of honorees included Thompson for best actress, Bruce Dern for best
 actor for Nebraska, Will Forte for best supporting actor for Nebraska 
and Octavia Spencer for best supporting actress in Fruitvale Station.

The
 Weinstein Co.’s drama also received 
recognition for best-directorial debut for Ryan Coogler and breakthrough
 performance for Michael B. Jordan.

The movie, Her, landed best picture and best director for Spike Jonze. The night opened with Coogler accepting his award from Lee Daniels.

Michael B. Jordan got up on stage and thanked his father. ‘He really showed me what it means to be a man.’

Brothers Joel and Ethan Coen were 
honoured for their Inside Llewyn Davis original screenplay and offered a
 characteristically short speech, according to Variety.

Ex-Sopranos writer Terence Winter accepted best-adapted screenplay for Wolf of Wall Street from Edie Falco and Steve Buscemi.

Some of the winners were repeats from the previous night’s New York Film Critic’s Circle Awards, including best animated feature for The Wind Rises and best documentary for Stories We Tell.

The trifecta of directors turned actors in Wolf of Wall Street –which includes Rob Reiner, Spike Jonze and Jon Favreau – presented the Spotlight Award to Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese.

‘We were never around when there was naked women,’ Reiner complained.

DiCaprio and Scorsese gave a funny speech where they completed each other’s sentences.

‘Keep it short,’ Scorsese said.

‘You mean, under-three-hours short?’ DiCaprio asked, alluding to their film’s 179-minute running time.

After thanking Streep for her tribute, Thompson mentioned New York's record-low temperatures.

‘It’s such a cold night,’ Thompson said.‘It’s the only time I’ve been actively grateful for the menopause.'
