David Cameron will address an audience of 2,200 at the party conference today, but he has spent the week building a much bigger crowd online.

The Prime Minister ignored his own advice about the perils of Twitter and signed up to the micro-blogging site on Saturday night, promising more 'edgy' political output.

Four days later @David_Cameron has attracted more than 100,000 followers, been bombarded with abuse and posted the obligatory photo of food.

'Thanks to my team for squeezing in a quick birthday celebration on this v hectic day.' The PM was presented with a caterpillar birthday cake by Foreign Secretary William Hague (centre) and Chief of Staff Ed Llewellyn (right)

Today he tweeted before his keynote speech, telling his followers: 'I’m levelling with the British people in my speech at 11.30. It's sink or swim, do or decline. How we'll ensure Britain wins the Global Race.'

And as he left the conference venue in Bimrngham he added: 'Just leaving what has been a great #cpc12. A big thank you to all involved, we really showed that 'Britain can deliver.'

In 2009  the Tory leader told Christian O’Connell’s Absolute Radio breakfast show: ‘The trouble with Twitter, the instantness of it – too many twits might make a t***.’

But with millions of people – and potential voters – on the site, the lure of Twitter became too strong to resist.

On Saturday night Mr Cameron announced his arrival on the site with a reference to his 2009 warning: ‘I'm starting Conference with this new Twitter feed about my role as Conservative Leader. I promise there won't be "too many tweets...’

On Monday Mr Cameron used the @David_Cameron account to reveal he had packed some boxes for the #supportoursoldiers campaign

Here is a selection of some of the comments which @David_Cameron is being bombarded with:

‏@Gaslef mornin dave, what atrocities are you planning to inflict on the working classes today then? #toriesruiningthenation

@JamesCridland today you say that Britain has no future unless difficult decisions are taken. I don't think you understand concept of time.

‏@JaneR1969: How are you getting away with killing off so many sick and disabled you turd? When are you going to be up in court for it?

@Codeine74 Hello Dave, this is your daily reminder that thousands of Britain's most vulnerable people are suffering more thanks to you.

@thisisamy_ I am seriously angry by @David_Cameron 's comments. Stop LYING & pretending you're helping the poor & vulnerable. You do not care one bit.

@Chad_C_Mulligan Yawn. Another super-shiny PR opportunity. Why aren't your sleeves rolled up, Dave?

‏@hoolscon spare us the mush about your family Dave, your a rich boy who inherited his wealth so don't try make out your one of us plebs

‏@Bethemediauk I thought you said you wouldn't tweet much. That's 7 now. 7 too many.

Before the account was set up aides 
promised it would be an ‘edgy’ and ‘more political’ outlet for the Prime
Minister to target voters.

The
official Downing Street accounts is covered by Civil Service rules on 
impartiality and cannot be used for party political purposes.

To date it has been rather more sedate, consisting of posts praising speeches by colleagues, alerting people to imminent TV appearances and photos of charity work.

The response has been rather more boisterous than the PM’s own tweets, with users posting a stream of abuse often aimed at Mr Cameron’s wealth.

Mr Cameron defended his decision to join the site this week.

He told Sky News: 'In this modern world you have got to use every means to try and communicate your message and explain to people why you are doing it.

'You've got to get with the programme, I suppose.'

Before the account was set up, sources close to the PM said they wanted to use it as political tool to reach voters directly.

'He wants something that’s able to be more political,’ said a party source.

‘Especially when it comes down to the local, European and general elections he needs something where he can connect more directly with the voters as leader of the Conservative party.’

Mr Cameron was the 370th MP to start an account.

So far Mr Cameron has not interacted with any voters, or even the 34 Tory MPs and peers he is following.

Within
12 hours the account had 75,000 followers but bookmakers Ladbrokes were
offering odds of 25/1 that he would reach 100,000 before the Tory 
conference in Birmingham closed today.

On Sunday David Cameron tweeted: 'About to appear on @MarrShow: I'll be explaining how we're on the side of people who want to get on in life.'

The first photo the PM posted: 'Today I met the nursing team at the John Radcliffe Hospital, and announced £140m to help their work across the country'

He passed that landmark early on 
Tuesday, later posting: I'm told some bookmakers are regretting laying 
odds against this account passing 100,000 followers during conference.’

Ladbrokes are now offering odds of 1/2 that he will reach a million followers by the end of the year.But punters can get 20/1 that the account will be closed before 2013.

With just a few hours to go until the close of the party conference, the bookies are offering odds of 4/1 that Mr Cameron will unfollow Boris Johnson's account before the party leaves Bimringham.

Aides say the next target is to overtake Ed Miliband’s account, which has 166,000 followers.

But the Labour leader's use of the 
site has not been without controversy, famously paying tribute to 
Blockbusters host Bob Holness with the hashtag #Blackbusters.

The Prime Minister's first tweet made reference to his 2009 warning that 'too many tweets might make a t***'

Aides had promised 'edgy' output which could be more political than official Downing Street accounts

So far it has been a little on the dull side, highlighting TV appearances and charity work

The response from other users has been more boisterous, with a stream of foul-mouthed abuse aimed at the PM
