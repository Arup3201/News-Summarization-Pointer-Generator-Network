Prince Harry’s close friend Natalie Pinkham is at the centre of an intriguing mystery after landing a top TV sports job – and replacing one of her closest friends.

Miss Pinkham, 34, who has been friends with the Prince for a decade, has been picked to host Sky Sports’ The F1 Show.

However, she is taking the position from her own close friend Georgie Thompson, who presented the magazine programme during 2012.

Miss Thompson, who left Sky Sports news for her F1 role at the end of 2011, had been expected to continue hosting the weekly pre-race show, but has not been seen on screen for several weeks, prompting speculation that she had been axed.

Last night, a Sky Sports spokesman declined to comment and Miss Thompson’s representative would not be drawn on her departure.

But sources insisted she had not been dropped and Sky insiders said she remained with Sky Sports.

Yesterday, there was no mention of Miss Thompson – a former girlfriend of Ant & Dec star Declan Donnelly – among the Sky Sports F1 team of presenters.

Instead, the Sky website names Miss Pinkham, a former pit lane reporter, as co-host.

Miss Pinkham’s appointment is  all the more interesting given her long-standing friendship with Miss Thompson, 35.

Last night, a spokesman for BT Sport denied reports that Miss Thompson had defected to the new digital channel which launches this summer.

On Friday both women used Twitter to update followers.

Miss Pinkham said she was heading out to Moscow with her F1 team. Miss Thompson said she was spending time with ‘an old flatmate’.
