Films could be downloaded to smartphones in just one second with new ultra-high speed mobile phone broadband technology, Samsung has claimed.

The fifth-generation technology will transmit data several hundred times faster than the 4G networks being rolled out across the country, says the communications giant.

Homes could have the wireless 5G system by 2020 using a vast network of masts, which may prove controversial but would mean an end to broadband cables to connect to the internet.

Samsung's Galaxy S4 smartphone: The Korean giant has developed 'ultra-high speed' fifth-generation technology that could allow users to download an entire film in a second

Samsung has been able to get speeds of 1 gigabit per second - far in excess of current 4G networks, which can makage 12 megabits per seconds.

According to Samsung, 'subscribers will be able to enjoy a wide range of services such as 3D movies and games, real-time streaming of ultra high-definition (UHD) content, and remote medical services.'

While 4G networks speed up standard 
downloads to about 13 minutes, subscribers of the new service would be 
able to download massive data files ‘practically without limitation’, 
enabling almost instantaneous access to games and 3D movies or the 
ability to stream ultra high-definition programmes in real-time.

The South Korean company claims its 
technology uses high-frequency wavebands previously deemed unsuitable 
for mobile networks.

Central to it is the creation of what bosses say is
 the world’s first transceiver capable of providing 5G to a wide area 
via a phone mast.

Samsung announced the breakthrough 
after tests in which data was transmitted at speeds of more than one 
gigabit per second over a distance of up to two kilometres.

However, analysts warned that faster 
downloads may mean bigger bills and raised health fears that new high 
powered broadcasts will fuel so-called ‘electronic smog’.

Samsung announced the development after conducting a test where data was transmitted at speeds of more than one gigabit per second over a distance of up to two kilometres.

Customers using 4G services - currently provided in the UK by EE - access average speeds of between eight and 12 megabits per second (Mbps).

'The new technology sits at the core of 5G mobile communications system and will provide data transmission up to several hundred times faster than current 4G networks,' Samsung said in a blog post.

Samsung has already trialled the technology over 2km distances, and found download speeds of 1 gigabit a second were possible, far higher than current 4G networks

The company believes the equipment could provide a solution to recent surges in wireless internet usage.

It
 added: 'Samsung’s new technology will allow users to transmit massive 
data files including high-quality digital movies practically without 
limitation.

'As a result, 
subscribers will be able to enjoy a wide range of services such as 3D 
movies and games, real-time streaming of ultra high-definition (UHD) 
content, and remote medical services.'

In
 the blog post, Samsung claims its technology uses high-frequency 
wavebands which were previously deemed unsuitable for mobile networks.

It said: 'The implementation of a high-speed 5G cellular network requires a broad band of frequencies, much like an increased water flow requires a wider pipe.

'While it was a recognised option, it has been long believed that the millimetre-wave bands had limitations in transmitting data over long distances due to its unfavourable propagation characteristics.

'However, Samsung’s new adaptive array transceiver technology has proved itself as a successful solution.

'It transmits data in the millimetre-wave band at a frequency of 28 GHz at a speed of up to 1.056 Gbps to a distance of up to two kilometers.'
