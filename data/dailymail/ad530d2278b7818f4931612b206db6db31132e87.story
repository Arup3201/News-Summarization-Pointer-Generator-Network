Hundreds of people armed with paddle boards gathered at Doheny State Beach, California, Friday to pay tribute to the late surfing and sailing legend Hobart 'Hobie' Alter.

Alter, who helped popularize water sports with the development of the foam surfboard and the 'Hobie Cat' sailboat, passed away from cancer March 29 at his Palm Desert home. He was 80 years old.

According to Alter's loved ones, he had always wanted to have a traditional Hawaiian paddle-out memorial, which is exactly what he got Friday at Dana Point.

Surfers from all over the world floated flowers in the water and raised their paddles in the air to salute the late pioneer of their sport.

His son, Hobie Jr, told CBS Los Angeles he never imagined so many people would come out to honor his father.

Alter Sr's family released bowls filled with Hawaiian soil, sand, ocean water and salt representing purification, The Orange County Register reported. 

Hawaiian priest Eric Keawe performed a prayer song as swarms of surfers in bright wetsuits floated in the clear blue water Friday evening.

Hobie Cat catamarans festooned with 
multi-colored sails were scattered around the beach, while the first 
surfboard ever made by Alter was on display at the Surfing Heritage 
Foundation booth nearby.

‘It
 was so much fun and such a great send off for Hobie. He’s such a great 
inspiration for all of us,’ former employee Mike Ester said.

A true ocean lover, Alter was a champion surfer who conquered the Makaha International Surf Contest in 1958 and 1959, and won a trio of tandem surfing championships from 1961-’63.

But Alter’s legacy will always be as surfboard and sailboat production pioneer.

He was dubbed 'the Henry Ford of the surfboard industry' by Steve Pezman for his contribution to the large-scale manufacture of surfboards.

The self-taught innovator and surfer 
had his start in the early 1950s carving wooden surfboards in the garage
 of his family's Laguna Beach home.

When
 the balsa wood used for the boards became scarce, he and his friend 
Gordon 'Grubby' Clark created surfboards out of polyurethane foam.

Where it all began: Hobie Alter opened his first retail shop in Dana Point, California (pictured) in 1954 and revolutionized surfing with his foam boards. An original Hobie long board is pictured

The
 boards were durable, but had better flexibility and were less expensive
 than wooden boards. The invention revolutionized surfing, and Hobie 
became a top surfboard brand.

Clark went on to launch Clark Foam, which
 had a virtual monopoly on the unshaped foam blocks that were used for 
custom-made boards.

In the late 60s, Alter turned his focus to sailing and designed a lightweight sailboat inspired by the twin-hulled Polynesian catamaran.

The more affordable Hobie Cat, which could be launched from the beach, is credited with bringing high-performance sailing to the masses. 

For his contribution to the sport, Alter was inducted into the National Sailing Hall of Fame in 2011.

He was survived by his wife, Susan, a daughter and two sons.
