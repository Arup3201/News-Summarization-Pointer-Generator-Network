It does not look, or sound, particularly appetising.

But after milkshakes and smoothies comes a new drink called Soylent – and its inventors claim it could spell ‘the end of food’.

Invented by an American entrepreneur Rob Rhinehart, who was frustrated by the amount of time it takes to prepare and eat normal meals, it is claimed the drink contains all the necessary nutrition we need.

To its first 30,000 customers, Soylent comes in white boxes containing pouches of powder and small containers of oil.

Mixing the two with water then gives the drinker 2,000 calories in liquid form, according its makers.

It is claimed that essential fats come from canola oil, carbohydrates from a food additive called maltodextrin and oat flour, while rice provides the protein.

Vitamins, minerals and rich oils are added to the mix.

Mr Rhinehart, a 25-year-old software engineer, says the drink is ‘delicious’ and described traditional solid foodstuffs as the ‘fossil fuel of human energy’.

But scientist have been expressing their doubts.

Ashley Blackshaw, a professor in enteric neuroscience at Queen Mary, University of London, says ‘all sorts of trace elements and phytochemicals, such as lycopene which is found in tomatoes, are missing’ from Soylent.

He says these elements are often found in plants and many are just beginning to be understood. Lycopene, for example, has been linked to lower rates of prostate cancer.

And he told a newspaper: ‘There’s the issue over the link between the efficient bacterial fermentation in the colon and cancer.

‘Everything in there is very finely balanced and out gut has evolved over millions of years, and if I even had a suspicion of a history of colon cancer, I’d stay away from a product like this.’

He added: ‘There is more and more work being done on the links between food and mood.

‘A shortcut like Soylent throws all that out the window.

‘We have to remember comfort food isn’t just a luxury to spoil ourselves with, but something that scientifically, we are increasingly seeing as something that should be part of our daily life.’
