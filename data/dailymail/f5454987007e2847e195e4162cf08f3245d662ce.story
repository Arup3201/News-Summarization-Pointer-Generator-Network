Kent's police and crime commissioner Ann Barnes, who started her £85,000-a-year post in November 2012, spent thousands on PR consultants

Kent's gaffe-prone police and crime commissioner who had to apologise after making a 'toe-curling' appearance on a 'disaster' TV documentary has used £16,000 of taxpayers' money to pay for media training, it has emerged.

Ann Barnes, who started her £85,000-a-year post in November 2012, spent thousands on PR consultants who were hired to give the force communications advice to improve its 'brand'.

It has also emerged that £2,400 was spent providing media training for youth commissioner Kerry Boyd, who was twice suspended after admitting having an affair with a Tory councillor more than twice her age.

The revelation is the latest embarrassment for the embattled crime tsar after a string of controversies under her watch.

This year, she was forced to apologise after being filmed saying she had 'no idea' what her taxpayer-funded job entailed - a storm which culminated in a rented plane flying over Maidstone, where she works, dragging a banner reading '#annbarnesout - resign'.

Her tenure has also included the resignation of her foul-mouthed youth commissioner - the first appointed in Britain - Paris Brown, who had to stand down after sending a series of controversial tweets about her sex life, violence, drinking binges and drugs.

According to the Kent Messenger, invoices published by the commissioner’s office under transparency regulations show one company was paid nearly £14,000 to provide recommendations on how to improve the force's 'brand' so it was better engaged with the public.

It says PR firm Finn Communications was paid £11,590 for work in June 2014, having previously been paid £2,146 in January last year for 'briefing and recommendations on communications consultancy project'.

The commissioner also paid £2,228 to consumer research company The Buzzz for work in October 2014.

A further £1,450 was paid to a company called DWP for 'media advice' while £3,370 was spent on providing staff with Freedom of Information advice.

But Mrs Barnes was quick to defend the bill, saying it was important 'to get an independent view on the communications being provided by Kent police'. 

In a statement, she said: 'I am committed to providing value for money for services that the public pay for.

'I believe it was important to get an independent view on the communications being provided by Kent Police and I was pleased to see recognition for the wealth of information being issued through various channels.'

The amount of money spent on media training is the latest embarrassment for the embattled crime tsar (pictured) after a string of controversies under her watch since she took the post in November 2012

Last year, the commissioner was forced to make a public apology in the aftermath of a fly-on-the-wall Channel 4 documentary broadcast last May, which was branded a 'disaster from start to finish'.

In Channel 4's Meet The Police Commissioner, she was compared to David Brent and accused of making Kent Police a 'laughing stock'.   

The next month, she was forced to appear before the Kent and Medway Police Panel, who scrutinise her role, where she admitted what an embarrassment the show had been - but refused to resign. 

The documentary had showed Mrs Barnes travelling in a van she dubs 'Ann Force 1' and bringing her dogs into the office.

In one clip Mrs Barnes was seen drawing an onion in an attempt to explain what types of crime Kent Police prioritises.

But when asked what the rings meant she said: 'Oh God, I've got no idea - I can't tell you actually - I wasn't thinking I'd be talking about the actual onion (the concentric circles) as we call it - umm I don't know know really - everything's important.'

She was then asked: 'So what would be an example of the kind of crime on the outside of that ring?', to which she replies that she had 'no idea'.

She was also asked: 'What is a police commissioner?' to which she replied: 'Oh dear, what is a police commissioner? Right, well it's not the Police Commissioner, it's the Police and Crime Commissioner.'

She later said: 'It's a strange job because there is actually no description at all - there are certain responsibilities you have to do, but there is no actual job description.'

She was also filmed painting her 'flaky' nails and compared the force to a tin of paint that she wanted to 'prise' open.

Mrs Barnes was also criticised for spending nearly £200,000 on moving her office when her force was trying to make cuts of £20million a year

The other huge scandal to have marked her tenure was the resignation of youth commissioner Paris Brown, who was investigated by the force after posting controversial comments about her sex life, violence, drinking binges and drugs.

The teenager, who had been appointed to the £15,000-a-year taxpayer-funded position just one week earlier, was forced to resign following a tearful apology about her behaviour.

Brown's successor Kerry Boyd, 20, was then suspended twice after admitting having a relationship with a married former Tory councillor more than twice her age, Robert Burgess, 50. 

Mrs Barnes was also criticised for spending nearly £200,000 on moving her office less than two miles at a time when her force was trying to make cuts of £20million a year.

She is also due to be quizzed over a car crash five months ago, amid claims she was uninsured and hindered the investigation.

Ms Barnes crashed her Mercedes soft-top into another car before hitting a tree as she drove to a meeting and has been facing an Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) inquiry.

But she has still not been interviewed following the incident in September last year. 

Barnes was uninjured in the collision in Dartford, Kent, but on Twitter she admitted 'not feeling too bright' afterwards.   

An IPCC spokesman previously said: 'The IPCC is investigating whether the police and crime commissioner for Kent, Ann Barnes, may have committed a criminal offence by not having in place appropriate insurance to cover business use of her own car when she was involved in a road traffic accident on 16 September 2014.

'The investigation will also determine how long the relevant insurance was not in place, if that is the case, and how many miles the PCC travelled on business use while uninsured.

'The IPCC is also investigating whether a police constable was obstructed in the execution of their duty when initial inquiries into the PCC's insurance cover were being made by Kent Police.'
