Glistening drops of dew can be seen in crystal clear quality on these beautiful damselflies.Â 

Photographer Adam Tomaszewski set out early in the morning to take the close-up shots of the damselflies resting in a tree.

Mr Tomaszewski, 24, said he has loved the insects - which have smaller eyes than dragonflies - since he was a child.

The university student, from Poznan, Poland, said: 'I love the fact you can find a whole range of colors of damselflies.

'They come in green, blue, red, brown, white, yellow, grey and combinations of these colours. They are really beautiful.

'On this day, the sky was clear, there wasn't the slightest cloud in the sky but the temperature was low.

Detail: Because of the water on this damselfly's eyes, it is possible to see its thousands of hexagonal lenses

Complex: This blue-eyed damselfly's vision is created by hundreds of tiny lenses crammed side by side into bulges that create a wide field of sight

'Near the river where I take pictures at 4am the temperature drops to 10-14C.

'The
main problem when photographing damselflies is they often fly away or 
move, so I like to take pictures early when they are calm and most 
still.

'This is a very beautiful damselfly - it has juicy red eyes and a nice blue trunk and is very rare in this area.'

Painstaking work: Tomaszewski spent around four hours taking pictures of the damselflies

He
spent around four hours taking pictures of the damselflies using the 
process of focus stacking, which merges a series of images together.

Mr
Tomaszewski, who is studying ecotechnology, said: "The most beautiful 
of all is the opportunity to show people how beautiful damselflies are 
and show something that normally would not notice.

'The animal world is a truly beautiful and diverse. You just have to look carefully.'
