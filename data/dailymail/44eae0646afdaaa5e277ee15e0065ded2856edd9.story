Toni Kroos hopes Cristiano Ronaldo can continue his sensational form and help steer Real Madrid to their second successive La Liga title.

Ronaldo scored his 23rd hat-trick La Liga hat-trick during Madrid's 3-0 win against Celta Vigo on Saturday, bringing his domestic goal tally to 23 in just 14 matches so far this season.

Kroos told Madrid's official website: 'Cristiano Ronaldo is a really important player. He put in a very good match and was decisive once again. He's always a key player and I hope he keeps it up.'

'The key is to keep up this consistency. We have to keep working like this and winning games. What's most important isn't the record for wins, but keeping on winning every game and staying in top spot.'

Despite winning 12 of their first 14 games, Kroos' team-mate Marcelo believes Carlos Ancelotti's side will have to keep their feet on the ground if the Galacticos are to remain at the top of La Liga.

He said: 'We can't take anything for granted. The secret is hard work, fighting spirit, togetherness and everyone showing desire.

'Cristiano is in really good shape, as you're all aware. The team helps him a lot and he helps the team. We're delighted to have him. Let's hope that what James picked up is nothing.'
