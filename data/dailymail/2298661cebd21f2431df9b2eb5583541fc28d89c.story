The Duchess of Cambridge's cousin Katrina Darling has been stripping off for celebrities with a sexy burlesque performance which saw her flaunt her own crown jewels.

She was a guest at the Life Ball in Austria, where she left very, very little to the imagination of the crowd, which included former US President Bill Clinton, Elton John and his husband David Furnish.

The heavily-tattooed burlesque artist, 23, used delicately-placed crowns to spare the worst of her blushes and also showed off some rather garish body art.

I say! She is a distant cousin of Kate Middleton and once appeared in Playboy magazine

Miss Darling, from Sunderland, only found out she was related to Kate in 2011 but has been quick to make the most of her new found Royal connections.

Her grandmother is sister to the duchessâ€™s great grandfather Thomas Harrison.

The former employee of Barclays bank moved her act to New York after discovering she's the Duchess of Cambridge's second cousin once removed.

Darling has previously drawn attention to her Royal link by doing a burlesque song and dance routine to God Save the Queen during the monarch's diamond jubilee.

She also appears on the cover of Playboy magazine where she was billed as a 'Royal beauty' and 'Britain's new burlesque Queen'.

It is the 21st anniversary of the Life Ball, which raises money for HIV and AIDS charities.
