Louis van Gaal has yet to show concrete interest in signing Norwegian teenage sensation Martin Odegaard, according to Stromsgodset's chief executive.

Odegaard is being tracked by the likes of Real Madrid, Ajax, Liverpool and Manchester United, but the Red Devils have not yet tabled an offer for the 15-year-old.

The Stromsgodset attacking midfielder is destined for big things and is sure to move to one of Europe's big clubs in the not-too-distant future.

Norway wonderkid Martin Odegaard is believed to have the option of signing a five-year deal with Real Madrid

Age: 15 (D.O.B. 17/12/98)

Born: Drammen, Norway

Position: Attacking midfielder

Club: Stromsgodset (2014-)

Appearances: 24

Goals: 5

International appearances: 3

International goals: 0 

But Stromsgodset's sporting director Jostein Flo told TV2: 'We have not received a bid from Manchester United for Odegaard, so once again this is just speculation.

'It might have come through the mailbox, but it has certainly not reached me.'

The youngster has already been shown around Ajax's training facilities and stadium, with Real also believed to have already made an offer for him. 

Odeagaard only began playing first-team football for the Stromsgodset this year but already has five goals in 24 appearances.

He also has three caps for the Norwegian national side after making his debut against the United Arab Emirates in August - all this before his 16th birthday on December 17.
