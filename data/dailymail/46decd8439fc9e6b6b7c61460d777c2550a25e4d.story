The Florida fertility doctor's son who caused his girlfriend to miscarry their baby by tricking her into taking a pill which is contraindicated for pregnant women was sentenced to over 13 years in prison on Monday.

John Andrew Welden, 28 of Tampa was handed nearly the maximum sentence he could receive as part of a plea deal in which he admitted to signing his father's name to a prescription.

Welden then swapped out the label for drug Cytotec with one for an everyday antibiotic and fooled his girlfriend Remee Jo Lee, 27, into taking the pill.

Sentenced: John Welden, seen here just after he was sentenced for slipping his girlfriend a drug and causing her to miscarry their baby, will spend nearly 14 years in prison for his crime

Victim: Remee Jo Lee (center) is seen here as she arrived to the U.S. District Court House in Tampa for Welden's sentencing. She lost her nearly 7-week pregnancy after Welden tricked her into taking Cytotec

She was six or seven weeks pregnant when she miscarried.

Welden pleaded guilty in September to tampering with a consumer product and conspiracy to commit mail fraud. He had faced a possible life sentence if convicted of his original charge, killing an unborn child.

Welden admitted in a plea agreement that he forged the signature of his father, who is esteemed Tampa-area fertility expert Dr. Stephen Weldon.

Welden’s father had no role in the heinous crime, but was in the courtroom in the weeks preceding sentencing as prosecutors sought to prove that the single dose of Cytotec had caused Lee’s miscarriage.

Prosecutors succeeded after expert witnesses for the state testified that any amount of the drug also known as misoprostol could cause miscarriage.

Plea: Here, Welden is escorted from the federal courthouse in Tampa after being released on bail. The 29-year-old confessed as part of a plea deal that spared him murder charges to swapping a drug for a common antibiotic and tricking his pregnant girlfriend into taking it

'The only thing I want now,' Lee (left) said in court of Welden (right), 'is for the court to show Andrew the same amount of mercy he showed me in my pregnancy'

As part of Judge Richard Lazzara’s decision, he said Welden is ‘not evil, he committed an evil act,’ reports WTSP, on that deprived Lee of her pregnancy in ‘the most cowardly way.’

Lee took the stand during the trial and glared at Welden, calling him a ‘dunce.’

'The only thing I want now,' she said, 'is for the court to show Andrew the same amount of mercy he showed me in my pregnancy,'

He’ll begin serving his 13.8 month sentence on Wednesday. He apologized profusely during the hearing and as he left.

Lee
 has spoken out about her heartache over the termination saying: 'I 
wanted this baby more than anything. Not because it was Andrew's, but it
 was my baby as well.'

He was originally charged with murder but under a plea deal the charges were reduced to tampering with a consumer product and conspiracy to commit mail fraud. He is currently awaiting sentencing.

Lee told 20/20 how the tragic
 event took place seven months into her relationship with Welden, who 
was in a five-year relationship with another woman at the time.

Lies: John Welden took Lee to his father's office for an exam after learning of her pregnancy and the next day as a way of tricking her to take the pill told her she had a mild infection and needed to take an antibiotic

Tragic: The fetus, pictured here in an ultrasound, was at over six weeks old when Lee miscarried. She had decided to name the baby Memphis

Other woman: He was reportedly worried his other girlfriend, Tara Fillinger, would learn of the pregnancy

The couple hit it off after meeting at the gentleman's club she worked in and soon started seeing each other.

'He went through a long-term relationship with a young woman named Tara. He said that that relationship had ended,' she recalled.

'He never even used condoms with me,'
 Lee said, adding that he would tell her he loved her. 'I was well aware
 of what could happen.'

Welden was a doctor's son working 
toward a degree in biomedical sciences and religion. When she told him 
she was pregnant, he did not take the news very well.

'Oh God, I want to die. Are you serious?' Is what Lee said Welden texted her 
when she sent him a picture of the pregnancy test results.

Remee, 
please don't do this, I beg you. I am destroyed.'

Welden took her to his father's 
office soon after for a prenatal exam and the next day he called her to 
tell her she had a mild infection and needed to take medication to clear it up.

'He worked for his father, at his 
father's clinics. So it wouldn't be strange or uncustomary, you know, to
 call me personally,' said Lee. 'He said I had a mild infection. I just 
needed to clear it up, that it would not hurt the baby.'

Welden then gave Lee what he told her were amoxicillin pills, as well as prenatal vitamins.

After taking one of the pills on her 
way to work, Lee told 20/20 she went from 'being pregnant and sick with morning sickness, to a horrible pain, like someone had shoved a 
bayonet into my stomach.'

Happier time: Andrew Welden, pictured with his ex-girlfriend Remee Lee, allegedly gave her pills and claimed they were antibiotics. But hours later, she was rushed to hospital and lost the baby

'Weapon of choice': This is the bottle of  pills that Welden gave to Lee after changing the label

She was rushed to hospital where she was told  she lost the baby.

It was there, that a doctor saw the 
pills Lee took and told her they were meant for inducing pregnancy.

Federal 
prosecutors said Welden never wanted Lee to have his baby - even 
though she was determined to keep the pregnancy and raise the child on her own.

After she lost the fetus in the hospital, she went to police and
 agreed to have her conversations with Welden recorded.

'I was hoping that this was some sort of horrible mistake,' Lee said. 'He told me what the medication was, and it was Cytotec.'

Authorities released a transcript of a conversation Lee had with 
Welden.

Welden told Lee that Tara Fillinger, his other girlfriend, had found out about their relationship and was 'furious'.

Lee says: 'If you wanted to go be with Tara, that's fine. Go be with Tara.

'I
 woulda had my kid and I woulda been fine with that... woulda told my 
parents it was someone else's. I wouldn't have bothered you for money. I
 wouldn't have bothered you at all.'

'I didn't want to be that guy,' Welden replies.

'So you're going to be the guy that goes and just kills the baby without even letting me know?' Miss Lee says. 'To save your own precious hide? Right?'

Welden responds: 'I guess. If I saved anything, I didn't really save anything.'

Welden also takes time during his conversation with Miss Hill to pity himself.

'My life is over,' he whines. 'I just wanna kill myself.'

After
 he admits to giving Lee the drug he says: 'I'm just a 
horrible person, Remee. I'm sorry I ruined everything.'

His father Dr Stephen Welden has not been accused of wrongdoing and has not been charged with any crime.

He told 20/20: 'Throughout his life, he has been singularly the most kind, thoughtful, compassionate of all my children,'

Welden was also recorded on jailhouse 
phone calls threatening to smear Lee's reputation and told Miss 
Fillinger that she didn't have to testify in the case, according to 
court documents.
