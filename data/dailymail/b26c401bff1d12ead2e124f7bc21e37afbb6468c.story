Crime in England and Wales fell by 15 per cent last year to a new record low since records began.

There were 7.5million offences in 2013 according to the British Crime Survey, down from almost 9million in 2012.

David Cameron sent congratulations to the police, with the figures showing a 22 per cent fall in both violent crime and bike thefts.

The crime survey for England and Wales showed a 15 per cent drop in crime in 2013 to 7.5million

The Crime Survey for England and Wales tracks all crimes committed by interviewing victims, and as a result includes offences not reported to the police.

It showed that there had been a 15 per cent overall drop in crime compared with 2012, and suggests crime has fallen by a fifth since before the coalition was formed.

It suggests the crime has more than halved from a peak of 19,109 offences recorded by the survey in 1995.

Mr Cameron wrote on Twitter: ‘Congratulations to the police - helping overall crime to fall 15 per cent in 2013 in England & Wales. Crime is falling.’

There was a 22 per cent fall in household theft, a 15 per cent fall in vandalism and a 4 per cent drop in burglary.

However, fraud rose by 25 per cent and shoplifting was up 6 per cent.

Lib Dem crime minister Norman Baker said: ‘We can have confidence that England and Wales are safer than they have been for decades, with crime at its lowest level since the survey began in 1981.’

The number of reports of sex offences was up 17 per cent, which has been linked in part to the ongoing publicity of abuse cases including that of shamed DJ Jimmy Savile.

Official figures recorded by the police showed a 2 per cent fall in total crime, but this smaller drop has been linked to ongoing concerns about the quality of officers’ data.

Police figures have been stripped of their official ‘gold standard’ status by the statistics watchdog.

The drop in violent crime comes after a poll published yesterday, which suggested that an increase in alcohol prices is partly responsible for a reduction in binge-drinking and serious violence for the fifth consecutive year.

The number of people injured in serious violence dropped by 12 per cent in 2013 compared with 2012, with more than 32,000 fewer people treated for injuries relating to violence in England and Wales, a Cardiff University report found.

Adam Pemberton, assistant chief executive at Victim Support, said: ‘While we welcome this significant fall in crime, it is important to remember that for many of the victims of 7.5 million crimes committed last year the impact will have been severe and long-lasting.

‘We are concerned to see a rise in fraud and shoplifting, crimes which can be wrongly perceived to have little effect on victims but are often very harmful to individuals, businesses and, in some cases, communities.’

MPs have raised concerns about the way police recorded crime, including categorising offences to present an unclear picture.

Whistleblower Pc James Patrick claimed massaging data to meet targets was ‘ingrained’ at Scotland Yard.

Chief Constable Jeff Farrar, who leads on crime statistics for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: ‘The statistics issued today are heartening but unsurprising.

‘They confirm to us that crime is continuing to fall and that the effect of prominent operations, such as Yewtree and the launch of Action Fraud, are resulting in more reporting of sexual offences and fraudulent activity.

‘Increased reporting allows us to get the fullest picture of these crime areas and make sure our work to combat them is properly resourced, as well as ensuring that we can maintain public confidence in the policing response.

‘The police service is committed to further cutting crime and using our resources as efficiently as possible so as to keep the country as safe as possible.’

Jack Dromey, Labour's shadow policing minister, said: 'The continued long term fall in overall crime is welcome, building on the reductions seen over the last decade and more.

'However, the Government should not be complacent.  Seven police force areas show increases or no reduction in crime, some kinds of crime have seen big increases and these figures also don't capture the full picture, as retail crime isn't included in the crime survey.'
