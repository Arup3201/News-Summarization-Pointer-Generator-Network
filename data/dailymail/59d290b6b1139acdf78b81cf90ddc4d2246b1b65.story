If Houston Texans defensive end JJ Watt doesn’t win the MVP award this year, there won’t be anyone more disappointed than Anthony 'JJ' Tarantelli.

The seven-year-old peewee football player has modelled his game after the NFL star and he plans to play in the league just like his idol.

Anthony detailed his exploits on the football field to in a letter to Watt and also sent the 25-year-old his autographed No 99 jersey so he would be able to ‘know me when I am a famous NFL player.’ 

Watt, who is unfazed by competing against crafty quarterbacks, aggressive offensive linemen and even other defensive players while serving as a tight end, was impressed by what young Anthony had to say.

‘This kid has some guts... I like it,’ Watt wrote after posting a copy of the letter and a picture of Anthony’s jersey on his Twitter account.

The 2012 Defensive Player of the Year may like the guts he sees from Anthony, but Watt has certainly shown some intestinal fortitude of his own this NFL season.

Will it be enough to win him an MVP?

Watt has 16.5 sacks, 10 pass breakups and 64 total tackles this season to go along with three forced fumbles, an interception and five touchdowns.

The scores haven’t all come on defense as Watt has caught three TDs as a tight end, but even his two defensive scores (one on an interception return and the other on a fumble recovery) are equal to the number of times Bernard Pierce, a running back for Sunday’s opponent the Baltimore Ravens, has reached paydirt this season.

JJ Watt has had a tremendous season with the Texans on both sides of the ball

Houston would not even be close to its 7-7 record without Watt and he likely is the most valuable player to his team in the truest sense of the word.

Unfortunately there have only been two defensive players to receive the award (New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor in 1986 and Minnesota Vikings defensive tackle Alan Page in 1971) and a quarterback or running back has walked away with an MVP trophy for 27 consecutive seasons.

For his part, Watt says it doesn’t matter to him.

‘That's for people like you to decide, not me,' Watt told MMQB'. 'I can't change any voters' minds, and I don't think I should try. I don't care, actually. It doesn't matter to me.

‘If people vote for me, great. But to politic for it, no. Please vote for me? No. People who play don't get to decide who wins, nor should they. I want to be deserving, but not because I politicked for it. My play on the field is all that should matter. Nothing else.’

Only time will tell if Watt will walk away with the award. If he doesn’t, it may be a long time until another defensive player even comes close… possibly until around the year 2030 when Anthony Tarantelli is terrorising the league.
