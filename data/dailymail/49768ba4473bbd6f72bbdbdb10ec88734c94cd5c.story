High-risk Australian jihadist Musa Cerantonio is set to walk free once deported to Melbourne.

Cerantonio will be deported from the Philippines on Tuesday night, and is due to arrive back in Australia on Thursday, according to the ABC.

Although Philippine authorities are treating the religious extremist as a 'high-value prisoner', he will not be taken into custody because there are no warrants for his arrest in Australia.

Musa Cerantonio was arrested by local police in the Philippines on Friday, but could walk free when he is deported back to Australia

'He is a VIP - a high risk and high value prisoner,' a guard told the Sydney Morning Herald last week.

Cerantonio, who converted to from Catholicism to Islam at 17, was expected to be deported for breaching the Philippines' immigration laws this week.

Changing his name from Robert Edward, the 29-year-old was detained last Friday in the central Filipino city of Cebu where he was believed to have been hiding from Australian authorities, despite claiming on Twitter he had arrived in the Middle East just days before.

He was found with a Filipina fashion designer claiming to be his wife, inside an apartment.

Australian authorities cancelled his passport, triggering his arrest and leaving without any documentation.

Police said Australian agencies had been monitoring Cerantonio's activities since February when he arrived in Cebu, the country's largest metropolis outside Manila and also his trip to the Filipino island of Mindanao.

The Philippines has a large Muslim minority in the southern region of Mindanao, a hotbed for a decades-old Muslim insurgency and where Islamic militants linked to al-Qaeda also operate.

As there is no warrant for his arrest, Cerantonio, pictured head down with Filipino police operatives on the day of his arrest, he could be a free man

Born to an Italian father and a mother of Irish heritage, Cerantonio has been living in the Philippines since 2013 and is one of the most influential supporters of Middle East jihadists.

Since his arrest, he has been held in an immigration jail at Metro Manila's police camp at Taguig city.

The jail holds some of the Philippines' top security prisoners, with Cerantonio being kept in a cell by himself. 

Australian Federal Police investigating terrorism and violations of the Foreign Incursions and Recruitment Act will continue to consider Cerantonio a person of interest.

This means it is illegal for Cerantonio to promote others joining foreign paramilitary forces or insurgencies.

On Wednesday, Attorney-General George Brandis introduced legislation to parliament which would strengthen ASIO's powers, enabling the national security intelligence service to track national security threats.

Within hours of Cerantonio's arrest, a Facebook page calling for his release hit the social media site.

Cerantonio himself has previously used the internet to urge people to join 'jihad'.

A Facebook page calling for Australian jihadist Musa Cerantonio's release has emerged

It has more than 3,000 likes and contains messages of support for the Australian jihadist

Followers of the Melbourne-born jihadist, who is one of extremist group Islamic State's most prolific members urging people to join them in Iraq and Syria, have used the page to post messages of support for Cerantonio.

Last week, the Abbott Government listed Islamic State as a terrorist organisation when it pushed through amendments to the criminal code.

Created on the same day as the jihadist's arrest, the Release Brother Musa Cerantonio page has attracted more than 3,200 likes and calls for Filipino authorities to free 'the man who opened our mind and dig the very root of jihad in the Philippines and All of the Muslim Lands'.

One supporter wrote: 'I love him so much, may Allah help and protect him always, he was chosen by Allah...stay strong bro'.

'May he be protected by ALLAH in all matters. He has the knowledge and courage given by ALLAH to tell the truth about ISLAM...,' another wrote on the page.

Cerantonio was arrested on Friday in Lapu-Lapu City in the Philippines

In a telephone interview on Friday, July 11, Supt Capa told AAP that Cerantonio had 'been in Cebu since February... For the most part, he keeps to himself in his rooms, in hotels or apartments'.

'In one broadcast on his website, he called on brother Muslims to join the war in Iraq and Syria.'

Supt Capa said Cerantonio was arrested and would be deported because the Australian government cancelled his passport, making him an illegal alien.

However, Mr Banas said there is 'no evidence linking him to any terror act'.

His arrest came more than a week after he tweeted on social media he had arrived in the Middle East to join his brothers of the Islamic State - which is also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.

'Al-Hamdulillah I have arrived in the land of Khilafah in Ash-Sham! May Allah honor all Muslims during this blessed time with His obedience,' he posted on Twitter.

Two days before that he tweeted: 'Insha'Allah I will be arriving in Ash-Sham very shortly, keep us in your du'a, getting ready to travel.'

Al-Hamdulillah means 'Thanks and Praise to God' in Arabic, Insha'Allah translates to 'God-willing', Ash-Sham refers to the Levant and the term du'a is used for the word 'prayers'.

The Australian Federal Police confirmed the arrest but neither confirmed nor denied whether they are conducting their own investigation.

'The AFP is aware that Philippine authorities have taken action in relation to Musa Cerantonio, which may result in his return to Australia,' the AFP said in a statement.

A federal government spokeswoman said she was aware Cerantonio had been detained but would not comment further.

Prior to his arrest, Melbourne-born Cerantonio tweeted he was in the Middle East

He is one of Islamic State's most prolific extremists with more than 6,000 followers on Twitter

'We cannot say with certainty that he had any contact with local Muslim groups,' Supt Capa said, adding the Australian had been living with a Filipina woman and moving periodically around Cebu until his arrest at a one-room apartment near the airport.

The 32-year-old woman -  who bought food and other supplies for Cerantonio - was wanted by police over an unrelated fraud case and was also arrested on Friday, he added.

A police intelligence officer involved in the operation said Cerantonio had been in Mindanao, though there was no indication he had tried to recruit Filipinos or been in contact with Islamic militants in the area.

'This person... has a website and he propagates extreme teachings and advocates jihad and calling on Muslim brothers to go to Syria and Iraq to fight together with the ISIS,' the official said, referring to the Islamic State militants who have seized large swathes of territory in eastern Syria and in neighbouring Iraq.

Cerantonio is expected to be deported back to Australia as early as Saturday

'Sometimes he mentions the Philippine government (on his website), but does not call for violence' against it, the officer added, adding that the Australian has 'no overt following' in the Philippines.

Television footage aired by the ABS-CBN network showed a bearded Caucasian man in a white robe being ushered out of an apartment by officers wearing helmets and flak jackets.

A report in The Australian newspaper in June described Cerantonio as a preacher and 'one of (the Islamic State's) most influential propagandists', and that Australian police were planning to move against him.

The newspaper said Cerantonio called for the assassination of Western leaders in a Facebook post in December, and that a study had found one in four foreign fighters in Syria followed his Twitter account.

Recently, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop commented that the government will do everything it can to ensure Australians don't become radicalised overseas and bring their extremist views back home.

Ms Bishop refused to comment specifically about Cerantonio to avoid jeopardising the work of Philippine authorities, but she said reports of Australian citizens getting involved with radicals and fighting overseas were disturbing.

'We are determined to ensure that Australians do not leave this country to take up fighting in another country, become radicalised and then return to Australia with these new skills and extremist outlooks,' she told reporters in Brisbane.

'We are taking every step we can to ensure that Australians are kept safe.'
