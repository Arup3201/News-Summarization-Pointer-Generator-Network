Scam: Mervyn Westfield arrives at the Old Bailey today where he admitted taking a bung to bowl badly so a certain number of runs could be scored

A former Essex county fast bowler has become the first English cricketer to admit his part in a match-fixing scam after pleading guilty to corruption at the Old Bailey today.

Mervyn Westfield, 23, was paid £6,000 by a betting syndicate to bowl in a way that would allow a certain number of runs to be scored from his first over, the court heard.

He admits accepting the money, but claims he did not carry out the request.

The agreed number of runs was 12, but only 10 were scored during his first six balls in the Natwest Pro40 game against Durham on September 5, 2009.

He also admitted he ‘received numerous approaches’ to concede runs for cash and was actually asked to fix a game. He claims he thought about the offers and declined.

His barrister, Mark Milliken-Smith QC, told the hearing: ‘A certain amount of runs were supposed to be given away in the first over that was bowled. They were not.’

The court heard the fixer who set up the spot-fixing scam is a well-known name in world cricket.

Judge Anthony Morris QC said: ‘It seems the alleged corrupter is a person whose name is known to me and I’m sure known to many people interested in cricket.’

Westfield, of Martin Drive, Rainham, Essex, said he agreed to the scam and took the money to do so, but did not keep up his side of the bargain.

He was caught when he 'unguardedly' confessed to a fellow player.

The case comes after world cricket was brought to its knees by a spot-fixing scandal which saw three Pakistani test players and their British agent jailed last year.

The plot involved two players deliberately bowling no balls at specific points in the match.

Mitigating for Westfield, Mr Milliken-Smith, said: ‘Having had the money, he did his best to keep his side of the bargain, but failed.’

He said the cricketer was either unable to do as he agreed or was attempting to trap the fixers. 

‘The aim was to snare for future activity,' he added. 'The reality is, on any view, he didn’t do what he was supposed to have done.

‘The case against Westfield is based almost entirely on what he told fellow players.

‘Of course, concentrating solely on the prosecution case for the moment, a certain amount of runs were supposed to have been given away in the first over that was bowled and they weren’t.

‘It is not just the defendant’s word. There is certainly no evidence that he did.'

Neither the player to whom Westfield confessed, nor the alleged corrupter were identified in court.

Mr Milliken-Smith said Westfield had no previous convictions, but accepted that the matter could result in a prison term.

But he will argue his client should be given a suspended sentence when he returns to court on February 10, he added.

Adjourning for sentence, Judge Morris told Westfield: ‘I hold up no promises as to the eventual outcome of this case.

‘Certainly it is open to the court in cases such as this to pass an immediate custodial sentence.’

Westfield, whose father is due to undergo an operation for prostate cancer next week, was granted unconditional bail.

A separate charge of assisting another person to cheat at gambling was ordered to lie on file.

Westfield is the first professional 
cricketer in England to face prosecution for his involvement in spot 
fixing in a County Cricket match, Essex Police said today.

A spokesman said that although it was centred on the domestic game, it would have 'far-reaching consequences' for world cricket.

The prosecution, which relates to a match played on September 5, 2009, involved the first use of Prevention of Corruption legislation within the context of a sporting event, the force said.

A number of agencies assisted with the investigation, including the International Cricket Council, the England and Wales Cricket Board, Essex County Cricket Club and the UK Gambling Commission.

Detective Sergeant Paul Lopez, of Essex Police, said: 'We hope this sends a strong message to professional sportsmen and women around the country - if they intend to get involved in spot-fixing, or think that match-fixing is not a crime, they need to think again.'

Angus Porter, chief executive of the Professional Cricketers' Association, welcomed Westfield's decision to enter a guilty plea.

'I'm not sure that court cases necessarily are very helpful, but the fact that he has admitted to the crime can only act as a signal to others that sport needs to be treated with respect and played properly, at any level,' he said.

'Our view on it is that the world has moved on quite a long way since he committed those offences.

'We've invested a huge amount in educating players as to their responsibilities, but I think that none of us can be complacent.

'I think that we are all very mindful of the need to make sure that sport is played properly.'

Asked if county players, who generally earn less than international cricketers, were especially susceptible to approaches, he said: 'I'm not convinced that we know who the high-risk groups are.

'There is no doubt that where there are threats of corruption they will be linked to gambling and that gambling will predominantly be on televised games.

'International cricket certainly is a risk and I think domestic cricket is also a risk because some games are televised on the Indian sub-continent so I suppose those specific matches are the ones we need to worry about.'

Westfield was released by Essex and now plays club cricket for Wanstead.

Last year, former captain Salman Butt, 27, plotted with pace bowlers Mohammad Asif, 28, and rising star Mohammad Amir, 19, to deliberately bowl three no balls at the Lords test against England in August 2010.

Butt was jailed for 30 months; Asif received 12 months and Amir was locked up for six months. 

Crooked businessman Mazhar Majeed, 36, was locked up for two years and eight months after the scandal was exposed by undercover News of the World reporter Mazhar Mahmood.
