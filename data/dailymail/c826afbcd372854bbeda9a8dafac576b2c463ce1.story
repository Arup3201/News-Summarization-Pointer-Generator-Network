Bayern Munich still have 'a long way to go' before being crowned Bundesliga champions and 'cannot plan to finish the campaign undefeated', insists the club's sporting director.

Matthias Sammer wants the club to remain focused as they aim to secure a third-straight Bundesliga title, despite the fact they are undefeated so far this campaign.

The German champions are 11 points clear of second-placed Wolfsburg, and 17 ahead of Bayer Leverkusen who sit third.

Bayern's sporting director Matthias Sammer believes there is still 'a long way to go' in the Bundesliga

But former Germany international Sammer wants Bayern to maintain their concentration when the Bundesliga resumes at the end of January

Speaking to the official Bundesliga website, Sammer said: 'No club in the world can plan to finish the campaign undefeated. We can be happy with a lot of things right now but we still have a long way to go.

'So far, the players have done a very good job in executing how Pep Guardiola and the club envisage playing football and we want to continue working on that. But don't believe for a second that every Bundesliga game isn't a new challenge.

'This isn't considered one of the strongest leagues in the world for nothing, and even the team that is top of the table at the halfway mark can't forget that.'

Pep Guardiola's side are unbeaten in the Bundesliga so far this season and are 11 points clear of Wolfsburg

Sammer - who represented Dynamo Dresden, Stuttgart, Inter Milan and Borussia Dortmund during his playing career - also believes that Bayern's philosophy and style of play is arguably more important than their results.

Bayern travel to closest-challengers Wolfsburg in their next Bundesliga outing, and Sammer expects to see Pep Guardiola's men passing the ball fluently.

He added: 'The Bundesliga is massively important to us and obviously we want to be right up there at the top, but more important than the result is the way you play football. After a successful game, you have the result.

'But when you go into another game three or four days later and you start thinking about the previous game, you don't think about the result. You think about the feeling you had playing that game.'
