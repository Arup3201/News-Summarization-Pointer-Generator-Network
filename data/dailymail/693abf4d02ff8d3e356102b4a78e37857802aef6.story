A Beatles fanatic has made his Fab Four dream a reality by splashing out on his very own yellow submarine.

Doug Poole, 73, found a second hand three seater racing sub online while googling the 1968 Beatles classic at home in Pembroke, West Wales.

The retired mechanic had originally seen a different Canadian-made sub worth $58,000 which he couldn't afford.

But after contacting the UK dealer for the second hand model, he made the purchase and immediately painted it yellow in honour of his pop heroes.

Father-of-three Mr Poole said: 'Like everyone back then in the Sixties, I was a big Beatles fan when I was younger.

'It's not everyone's favourite Beatles one but you can't sing 'We all live in a yellow submarine' without a smile coming onto your face.

'One day I tapped in yellow submarine into my computer and I saw one for sale. I just knew then that I had to get one.'

Labour of love: Mr Poole spent two years renovating the submarine to its yellow Beatles glory

Mr Poole spent two years renovating 
the sub after it was originally painted black and used for Royal Navy 
underwater filming in Portsmouth.

Mr Poole returned it to original condition and has given it a coat of bright yellow paint in tribute to the Fab Four.

He's taken the submarine out for test runs in the Pembroke docks near where he lives and is now preparing for his first full submersion.

Doug said: 'My grandaughter bought me the Beatles soundtrack and now we listen to it whenever we are taking the submarine out.

'It attracts attention wherever I go, people always want to climb inside the yellow submarine and have a look.' 

He tows the battery-powered yellow 
submarine on the back of his car to waters edge - and hopes to dive as 
low as 30 metres below the waves.

Doug said: 'There's quite a lot to it but it's like driving a car once you master the basics.

'Now I'm ready to take her out, I'll be able to go under water for about three hours.

'It's not quite living in a yellow submarine but it is as close as I can get.

'While you're in the submarine you sit in an air bubble which means your feet are underwater but the rest of you stays dry.

'So you can have a sandwich and a coffee as you're going along - and singing the Beatles.'
