Stoke defender Phil Bardsley is a doubt for the Barclays Premier League clash against Burnley with a groin injury.

The right back limped off during the early stages of the Potters' win over Tottenham on Sunday.

And scans have identified a small tear in the former Manchester United man's groin.

Bardsley will spend the international break recovering from the injury and is not ruling out a return against the Clarets on November 22.

But if he does not prove his fitness by then, Bardsley should be fit for the visit to Liverpool seven days later.
