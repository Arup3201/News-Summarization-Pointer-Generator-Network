A creepy man has been caught on camera lying under the seats of a Metro train while he touched women's legs.

The terrifying snaps of a man wearing a blue mask and coat were taken on the underground system in Beijing, China.

Another passenger spotted him lying beneath the moulded plastic seats before reaching out to the legs of women who sat down.

The picture-taker, called Mr Zhou, said the man hid even deeper under the seats after noticing him taking pictures but 'after a short while, he started to touch the legs again'.

Amazingly, none of the woman in question appeared to react to what was happening.
