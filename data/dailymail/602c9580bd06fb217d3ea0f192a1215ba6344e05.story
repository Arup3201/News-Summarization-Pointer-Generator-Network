A harsh frost will hit the country tonight before temperatures soar by an astonishing 18C over four days to leave the UK warmer than Athens.

Forecasters last night also warned of fierce gales in a week of topsy turvy weather that will chill, soak and then buffet the nation.

Their warnings come as Met Office figures confirmed last year was the warmest in Britain since modern records began in 1910.

One series of records, collected in an area of central England between London, Bristol and Lancashire, even put 2014 as the warmest since 1659 – breaking a record dating back 355 years.

 It was also the fourth wettest year on record for the whole of the UK, since 1910.

The average temperature across Britain was 9.9C, some 1.1C above the long term average of 8.8C, making it warmer than the previous record year of 2006.

There were no record-breaking hot months in 2014, but temperatures were consistently warm with only August experiencing below average temperatures.

The number of frosts in the UK was the lowest in records dating back to 1961, the provisional figures show.

That particular statistic will likely be far from the mind tonight, when a clear night and northerly wind is expected to bring a deep frost across the country. The mercury will plummet to a bitter -4C overnight.

Mark Wilson, forecaster at the Met Office, said: ‘The frost will be widespread across the country with the coldest temperatures likely in rural spots.’

But the chill will be shortlived, with the wind swinging to the south-west tomorrow, bringing a warm air mass from southern Europe which will see temperatures soar over the next few days.

Parts of southern England will experience temperatures as warm as 12C on Thursday and 14C on Friday – which will be hotter than those predicted for Athens, Rome and Istanbul.

The temperatures are far above the average 6.9C expected in England for January. 

They will, however, be accompanied by fierce winds and heavy rain. Mr Wilson said gales would peak on Friday with winds of up to 65mph expected in northern England

Climate experts and green campaigners insisted 2014’s temperature record shores up evidence for global warming. The figures for 2014 mean that eight of the UK’s top ten warmest years have occurred since 2002.

Bob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics said: ‘This is clear evidence of the impact of man-made climate change on the UK.

'The lack of awareness of the UK public of how climate change is already affecting them represents a colossal failure by the Government and its agencies…to communicate with the public about this issue.’

Simon Bullock, of the Friends of the Earth, said: ‘Without action to cut our use of fossil fuels the world is going to keep warming – with ever-increasing risks of climate disasters.’

The Met Office says the weather record of one individual year cannot be attributed to man-made global warming. But it also points out climate change makes warm years more likely than not.
