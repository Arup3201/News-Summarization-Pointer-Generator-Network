A vengeful former employee who leaked sandwich franchise Subway’s secret recipes in a suspected $35 million extortion attempt has avoided all criminal charges and a potential multimillion dollar compensation pay out.

The Victorian Supreme Court found the accused, Melbourne man Arun Singhal, responsible for uploading videos online in August which revealed the franchise’s recipes, known within the company as ‘The System’.

Subway had accused Singhal of intending to destroy the company’s reputation and commercial viability for his own profit with his smear campaign, according to Sydney Morning Herald.

The 31-year-old self-titled ‘entrepreneur maintained that he was being unfairly targeted by company, who he refers to as the ‘sandwich mafia’.

However, despite the Supreme Court ordering Singhal to pay damages to the company Subway has chosen not to continue with its compensation claim.

Singhal was hired in January 2014 to run Subway’s Oakleigh store in Victoria as a franchisee.

However his contract was terminated on April 28 due to ‘breaches’, understood to be disagreements regarding the operation of the business.

In court documents, the global corporation alleged that 31-year-old Singhal sent an email in May demanding $35 million from the company for his ‘silence’.

He threatened to release the ‘The System’ online, filmed with his running commentary, to expose what he claimed are the company’s ‘shocking’ and misleading marketing tactics.

Following the threat, Subway was granted an emergency restraining order against Mr Singhal by the Victorian Supreme Court which prohibited certain information from being released.

Despite the injunction a website was set live, titled ‘Faith Killer Subway’ and videos were distributed.

Mr Singhal vehemently denies releasing the information and any plot to blackmail Subway and claims he is the victim of the 'Sandwich Mafia'.

Last year, he told Daily Mail Australia that he was forced to declare bankruptcy after the company allegedly duped him into closing his store by promising could open a new one elsewhere.

No new store became available.

'After they took my authorisation to close the store and I closed the store, then they completely changed their words,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I was told that they don't have any new location right now and I might have to wait for two to three years for a new location.'

He blames what he calls ‘Subway's as usual deceptive behaviour'.

'Here a family man lost $350,000 in Subway's investment. They left me with no option then to declare bankruptcy. I told the "Sandwich Mafia" that if you don't compensate me for the loss of business, I am going to media to tell everyone about my story (sic).'

A spokesman for Subway told SMH that they are pleased with the result.

'We were forced to take action against this former franchisee after he attempted to extort money from the company for his own gain,' he said. 

'That is unacceptable to the company and to the dedicated franchisees that are in their restaurants every day servicing customers and working to build their businesses.'
