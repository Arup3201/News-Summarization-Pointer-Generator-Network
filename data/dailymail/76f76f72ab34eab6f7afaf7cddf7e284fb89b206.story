Queen of the kitchen Mary Berry has taken to the seas and helped to break a world record in the process.

The celebrity chef was part of an effort which saw the record for the most ships inaugurated in one day by one company.

Mary travelled to Amsterdam to break a bottle of bubbly over one of 14 new Longships that were sent to sea for the first time yesterday; all part of the Viking Cruises fleet.

Mary, here with the ship's captain, christened Alsvin in the traditional manner in Amsterdam by smashing a bottle of champagne across its bow and in doing so, she became the official Godmother to the vessel

After the ceremony, which was one of a World Record breaking 14 done yesterday, Mary headed straight down to the ship's kitchen

Mary watched the ship's cook whip up some culinary delights below the deck

She christened Alsvin in the traditional manner in Amsterdam by smashing a bottle of champagne across its bow and in doing so, she became the official Godmother to the vessel.

The 78-year-old attended the event with her daughter Annabel and after christening the ship Alsvin and meeting her crew, Mary of course made her way down to the vessel's kitchen to watch the chefs in action.

Mary was one of the ‘ceremonial godmothers’ chosen to take part in the record breaking attempt which saw 14 ships simultaneous named in a ceremony.

The next Bake Off contestant? The kitchen queen seems rather impressed with the rolls

Speaking about the event, Berry said: ‘It's an honour, as well as an amazing experience, to christen a vessel which I know will be home for Viking guests as they embark on river cruising throughout Europe.

‘After spending some time on board the Alsvin, I can see why people are so taken with river cruising. As someone who is fascinated by travel, culture and food destinations you certainly get a sense of the Viking spirit on board.’
