There is one word to sum up Julien Macdonald, and it's an obvious one, given that it's his favourite: fabulous.

And that, as ever, is the best way to describe the Welsh designer's catwalk show. This is a man, after all, who has crystal balls in his kitchen and wears gold kaftans to Tesco (probably).

His show today was a feast of glitter and glamour: gold gowns sprinkled with shimmering paillettes; chiffon dresses in palest oyster with sparkling silver mesh; backless pieces with sweeping trains and sheer cut-out sections revealing a glimpse of (beglittered) skin beneath.

Showstoppers: Julien Macdonald's collection was, as ever, all about 
metallics, high shine and unapologetic glamour. 'The people who buy my 
clothes don't worry about money,' he said. 'They buy the best, they love
 diamonds, jewellery.' CENTRE: Stand out: The leotard Pixie Lott was 
eyeing up, saying, 'it would look amazing in a music video'. RIGHT: The collection was incredibly intricate and had taken hours to finesse

Hard work: Welsh designer Julien Macdonald says creating a collection is 'painful' - with hours of embroidery and sewing on beads - but the results are stunning

Feminine: Inspiration came during a friend's 40th birthday party in Marrakech, where Julien says he dressed in gold kaftan, gold slippers and wandered through the Souk, disregarding the laughter. 'I'm on my holidays, and if I want to wear a gold kaftan I will,' he said today

Spectacular:  Delicate lace and shimmering embellishment on chiffon were the order of the day

I loved a silver gown with crackled mirror finish; a long-sleeved, space-age sequin beauty with centre split and a chiffon dress with intricate blue and silver embroidery that looked to have been stitched by elves.

Pixie Lott, who sat front row, loved a rather daring leotard made of nothing more than chiffon and some judiciously placed beads and sequins. 'It'd be amazing for a music video,' she said.

Abbey Clancy, wearing Macdonald, said the entire show was 'amazing', but in particular she adored a long black macro-crochet dress. 'But if I go out in it I'll definitely wear underwear,' she says.

After the show, which also saw Paloma Faith, Eliza Doolittle, Laura Whitmore, Pixie Lott and Melissa Odabash perch front row in JM designs, Julien said the show was inspired by a recent trip to Morocco.

'We all went to Marrakech for my friend's 40th birthday party,' he says, holding court among his Strictly pals - none of whom can rival him in the body glitter stakes. 'I was so inspired by the colours, the textiles, the flowers, the femininity.

'But I was even more inspired in the evening when people went home and changed into the most glamorous outfits they wanted and they partied the night away under a very exotic sky.'

Glamour: A red carpet ready dress on the runway

Exotic: Macdonald says he was inspired by a trip to Morocco

Magical: The fairytale collection included lashings of silver mesh

'Fabulous': Abbey Clancy said from the FROW that this black crochet dress was her favourite - but she'd be wearing it with underwear - while right, metallic embroidery elevated gowns into the spectacular

Recession proof: Julien says his customers are the sort who buy diamonds - they're not phased by the poor economy

Make-up, by Val Garland, was ethereal, like a tribe of exotic fairies on a big night out.Models' skin dazzled with a layer of gold glitter, their hair (by Martin Cullen at Streeters) slicked back. Shoes were by Gina (models were slipping on sliding on the Perspex floor: 'Whatever! They looked fab-u-lous', said Julien afterwards).

Julien, being Julien, wore a showstopper, of course.

'I was actually wearing - you're going to love this - a gold kaftan, with a gold belt, a gold Moroccan slipper, and a little pochette.

'And I walked through the Souk to my friend's birthday party. They all thought I was mad and everybody laughed at me.

'But I thought, you know what? I don't care. I'm on my holidays, I'm in Morocco. If I want to wear a gold kaftan... and I did actually wear a gold kaftan. I did it. And I loved it.'

So when can the rest of us get away with wearing showstoppers like Julien's?

'You know what?' he says with typical enthusiasm. 'Any time, any place, anywhere. Just have fun with fashion, enjoy it. Enjoy yourself and be a woman. So what?'

For Julien though, while he may be the very embodiment of mischievous devil-may-care once the work is done, nothing about the planning for his show is 'so what'.

The preparation and backbreaking work that goes into creating such an extravagant show is no mean feat.

Indeed, Julien has one word for it: Pain. 'It's a painful, arduous task of embroidery and sewing,' he laughs.

'It is a total nightmare that looks like a total dream at the end. It's a lot of hard work. We were doing the hair and make-up test in my kitchen at half past four this morning.

'In the end I was like, "guys, it's half past four, I'll see you at the venue tomorrow. If it's not working, we'll start all over again."'

Take a bow: Julien enjoys the applause at the end of his enjoyable (and incredibly glamorous) show
