West Ham have revived their deal for Hamilton left back Stephen Hendrie. The 20-year-old is poised to fly down to London and undergo a medical this week ahead of finalising terms. 

The move looked to be off last week when Hamilton vice-chairman Ronnie McDonald criticised West Ham, however, David Sullivan has smoothed over negotiations. 

Reading and Bournemouth have also shown an interest in the Scotland Under 21 international but he had his heart set on a move to Upton Park.

Hendrie is a left-back, currently at Hamilton, but the 20-year-old is poised for a move to the Premier League

West Ham left-back Dan Potts is discussing a move to Blackpool while talks are continuing with Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher who is available on a free.

Manchester United will allow the 30-year-old to leave and will contribute to his salary but there is still some negotiating to be done to reach the desired contract. It may take until the weekend for it to be resolved.

Fletcher is cured of his ulcerative colitis and is looking to make up for lost time with his next move. The Scotland international is a popular figure at Old Trafford but wants to play regular first team football.
