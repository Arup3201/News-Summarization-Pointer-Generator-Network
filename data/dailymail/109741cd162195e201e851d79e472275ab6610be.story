A tech startup worth more than JetBlue and many other brand names might not even be real.

High-flying Cynk Technologies has soared 30,000 per cent to more than $18 a share in the last month, raising its market value to more than $5billion. JetBlue, an established brand-name airline, is worth $3billion.

Cynk is behind a social networking site called IntroBiz, which markets itself as a way to meet angel investors, celebrities, business owners and more.

Off its highs: Cynk Technology hit more than $18 per share but has since fallen from that lofty perch under increased scrutiny

‘Thru [sic] our marketplace you may both buy and sell the ability to socially connect to individuals such as celebrities, business owners, and talented IT professionals,’ the site boasts.

Pictures of many celebrities including Angelina Jolie, Nicole Kidman, Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio are shown as ‘recent intros’ on the site’s homepage.

It is not clear what has sent the stock literally climbing through the roof from six cents per share to more than $18 a share since June 16, there are signs trouble is afoot.

Cynk’s headquarters is in Belize, the company is incorporated in Nevada and its only contact number is in Miami, Huffington Post noted.

A MailOnline call to that number was not answered and disconnected after ringing more than 20 times.

A filing earlier this year with the Securities and Exchange Commission said the company would not be able to file its annual report this year.

‘The Registrant is unable to file its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 within the prescribed time without unreasonable effort or expense because the Registrant and its accounting staff require additional time to complete the financial statements and the notes,’ said the filing.

A MailOnline call to the (800) number listed as the contact for Marlon Luis Sanchez resulted in a phone company message saying the number is unassigned.

Sanchez is listed in the filing as the CEO, CFO, CAO, President, Secretary , Treasurer and Director of Cynk Technology.

Cynk has only $39 in assets and almost $52,000 in liabilities, according to its most recent quarterly filing available on OTCMarkets.com.

The company has lost money for several quarters and has no income, according to annual income statements available on Yahoo Finance.

Bubbles come and go, but this company’s valuation defies logic.

It is not clear what has driven the company’s shares to unfathomable heights – but a pump and dump scheme could be the culprit.

Pump and dumps schemes work when brokers work to sell a penny stock - at six cents per share and trading over the counter, Cynk was a penny stock - to unsuspecting investors in order to drive the stock price up.

Straw buyers also take positions in the stock, and sell their shares at a predetermined price where they realize a huge profit. Once they sell, the stock goes back down again and everyone else loses their shirt.

Jordan Belfort, known as the 'Wolf of Wall Street' went to jail for a number of crimes including pump and dump schemes.

SEC policy prohibits the agency from commenting on pending investigations, and a spokesperson would neither confirm nor deny the regulator is looking into the company.
