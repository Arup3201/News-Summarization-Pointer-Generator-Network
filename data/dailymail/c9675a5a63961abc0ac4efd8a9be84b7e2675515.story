South Australian senator Penny Wong said it would have been impossible to keep the good news under wraps after telling her three-year-old daughter Alexandra she'll soon have a little brother or sister.

The Labor senator and partner Sophie Allouache have announced they're expecting their second child in April, to the delight of their first born.

'Like all families we had to think about whether we tell the toddler because she’s notorious – she doesn’t know what a secret is,' Sen Wong told The Advertiser in Adelaide. 'But we decided to tell her because we thought it was important she knew.'

And apparently, the excited Alexandra has been telling the world. 

'At the Labor convention she sat reading The Gruffalo to a baby over and over again … I came over and asked how it was going and a friend said ‘it’s all really good but she’s just told everyone Mummy’s got a baby in her tummy,' said Ms Wong. 

The couple have reportedly used IVF and the same sperm donor to conceive their children.

Sen Wong says the pair are lucky to have her own mother and Allouache's family for support in raising their family.  But she concedes that juggling motherhood with her demanding political career can be challenging.

'I think we’ve still got so far to go as a society as to how we balance work and family,' she said. 

That question of balance is expected to be back on the political agenda before long with the Abbott government announcing it will be reviewing childcare funding and its controversial paid parental leave scheme early next year.

Senator Wong is the third Labor politician to announce she is expecting a new addition in 2015, with labor frontbenchers Kate Ellis and Amanda Rishworth also due to give birth in the New Year.
