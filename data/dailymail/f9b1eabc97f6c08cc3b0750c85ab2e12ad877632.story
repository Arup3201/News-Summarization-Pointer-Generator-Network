The BBC is planning to use £740 million from the licence fee to fill a giant £2 billion hole in its pensions scheme.

A new valuation has revealed that the deficit in the Corporation’s pension fund has almost doubled from £1.1 billion in 2010.

But instead of asking staff to help plug the gap – a request which previously led to strikes and prime-time programmes taken off air – the BBC will take a large slice from the taxpayer-funded licence-fee to foot the bill over four years.

Black hole: The BBC is planning to use £740 million from the licence fee to fill a £2 billion gap in its pensions scheme

At about £185million a year, each top-up is nearly twice the annual budget of Radio 4.

The figures, published in a report by the BBC’s independent pension trustees, mean around £7.36 of every household’s £145.50 licence fee now goes towards the pension deficit. But rather than release the embarrassing figures publicly, the BBC published them only in an internal email to its staff, prompting accusations it wanted to hide the bad news.

MP Rob Wilson said the BBC should have been 'accountable' and made the announcement publicly

Last night Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘It says it all about how the BBC operates that this huge black hole in its pension fund was announced internally, rather than the Corporation being open and accountable to the public who will have to foot the bill.’

Similar to public sector workers, many BBC staff had a generous final-salary scheme that guaranteed a pension based on the length of service and earnings at the end of their careers, but it was closed to new staff in 2010 amid concerns over the mounting deficit.

The BBC has already faced criticism that it is overstaffed and bloated with managers.

A FOI request in 2011 found that out of 4,500 staff on permanent and fixed-term contracts, 2,000 had the word ‘manager’ included in their job title. It also has 8,000 journalists – vastly more than the rest of Fleet Street put together.

Between now and 2017, the BBC will have to pump an extra £365 million into its pension fund on top of £375 million it had already agreed to pay.

However, the BBC yesterday said it had anticipated the increase in its pension deficit two years ago, and took the increased payments into account when making its current financial plans. This meant that programme budgets are unaffected by the additional payments from the licence fee.

The BBC’s generous pension arrangements have been a source of contention for years. Some of those who have benefited from huge BBC pensions include former deputy director general Mark Byford, who walked away with a £3.4 million pension pot – on top of a £1 million severance payment – when he was made redundant in 2011, and radio chief Dame Jenny Abramsky, who retired in 2008 with a pension pot worth £3.9 million.

The last pension valuation, in 2010, led to protracted industrial action after the BBC asked staff to accept lower benefits and higher contributions. When negotiations with unions collapsed, journalists and technical staff left their posts, forcing flagship programmes including Today and Newsnight off the air.

Last night, BBC insiders said the deficit had been caused by low interest rates and an increase in the life expectancy of pension holders. A BBC spokesman added: ‘We have agreed a sensible and affordable plan to address the deficit, without adversely affecting programmes or pension scheme members.’
