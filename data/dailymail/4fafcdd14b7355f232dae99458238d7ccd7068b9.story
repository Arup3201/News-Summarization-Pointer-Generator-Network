President Obama was in high spirits on Sunday night as he got into the groove with a Philadelphia boy band.

The 53-year-old was filmed clapping and dancing along to the a cappella group Brotherly Love during a campaign stop at Temple University for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf.

'Give it to me,' he tells the group of five singers, aged 17 to 20, as he rhythmically swings his hips.

Celebrity encounter: Brotherly Love has apparently been inundated with offers to perform after being seen with the President - Top of the charts is a gig  at a Philadelphia 76ers basketball game

Brotherly Love was meant to stop backstage for a photograph with the President after performing at Temple University.

Clad in white suit tails, they'd been booked to warm up crowds with renditions of R&B hits including Jackson 5’s 'I Want You Back.'

However, when they met Obama they decided to give him a quick private show with cameras rolling. They promptly uploaded the 15-second video to YouTube, with many fans applauding their vocal skill.

According to TMZ, since being seen with the President Brotherly Love has been inundated with offers to perform. 

Top of the charts is a gig to sing the national anthem at a Philadelphia 76ers basketball game.

It was a lucky encounter for the performers as Obama has stayed off the scene for much of the campaign trail as some Democrats find it a liability to be seen with him.
