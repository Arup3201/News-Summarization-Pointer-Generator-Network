A firm of real estate agents is asking workers to make the ultimate gesture of loyalty by getting its logo permanently tattooed on themselves.

Dozens of agents at Rapid Realty in New York City are now getting inked after the firm offered a 15 per cent pay rise in exchange for the permanent advertising.

And since there are no specifications on size or location, many see the move as easy money.

Brooke Koropatnick got the Rapid Realty logo etched discreetly behind her ear. She told CBS New York: 'I had a paycheck coming in what was a substantial amount of money different, so it was nice.'

Rapid Realty owner Anthony Lolli says he came up with the idea after a loyal employee unilaterally decided to go for it and get the company logo tattooed.

'He calls me up, he says "Hey Anthony, I’m getting the logo on me." I show up at the shop and I’m like "this is cool, how can I repay you?",' said Mr Lolli.

After promising the bumper pay rise to any more employees who got his company's emblem tattooed, scores have taken him up on the offer.

Everyone's getting it done: At least 40 of Mr Lolli's employees have taken him up on the offer so far

The idea brings back memories of the 
boom in 'skinvertisements' fuelled by the dotcom boom of the early 
2000s, which has left scores of people branded for life with the names 
of now-defunct online firms.

With
 premium prices paid for rarely covered spots, it left some walking 
around with the URLs for online casinos and porn websites plastered 
across their faces and forearms.

Mr
 Lolli has not asked his employees to deform themselves so seriously, 
but that history poses the question as to whether some may regret the 
decision some way down the line.

Good idea? The idea brings back memories of the 'skinvertisements' fuelled by the dotcom boom of the early 2000s, which left scores of people branded for life with names of now-defunct online firms

Robert Trezza recently became the 40th Rapid Realty worker to get inked, while Joseph Tighe went under the needle just a month after joining the company.

'My wife was a little concerned but I said, you know what, it was the best commitment I could think of,' said Mr Tighe.

The Rapid Realty tattoos, which have so far cost up to $300 but vary in price depending on their size, are paid for by the company. Mr Lolli said he's not got one yet, but will soon.
