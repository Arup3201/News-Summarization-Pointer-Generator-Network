An eight-year-old boy in South Carolina drowned in freak circumstances in an above-ground, backyard pool while swimming in three-feet of water last week.

Investigators have speculated that Gavin Quance - who was on the school swim team - became entangled or stuck under the pool cover which had bunched at one end of the water.

Indeed, when his distraught mother found her son face-down in the pool, the ladder was lying on the lawn a few feet away as if knocked and a hose was still filling up the tank.

Autopsy results are due from the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, Beaufort County Coroner Ed Allen said on Thursday according to The State.

The initial assessment by emergency service were that that boy had not suffered any injuries or struck his head from a fall.

The tragic child's 14-year-old brother, Cooper, told police that he was asleep when the accident happened and he was awoken by his mother's screams when she found her eight-year-old floating face down.

Amanda Quance had been checking on her son periodically and desperately tried to perform CPR when she brought him out of the water.

The teenage brother waited indoors with his two-year-old brother while emergency services joined the battle to save Gavin.

The teenager said he 'didn't understand what was happening,' according to the police report.

Distraught, he told reporters from The State that he couldn't see why his brother could not be saved.

In fact, he had a cousin who nearly drowned as a toddler in Florida but was saved by external defibrillators.

Sadly, Gavin Quance could not saved by a defibrillator.

His family have launched a GoFundMe page to help with costs.
