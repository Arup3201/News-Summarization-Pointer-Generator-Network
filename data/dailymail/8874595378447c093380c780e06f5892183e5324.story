Jimmy Savile’s former chauffeur was charged today with 32 offences against young girls including a series of rapes.

Ray Teret, 72, who was also a flatmate of the disgraced DJ, spoke only to confirm his name and address during the 30-minute hearing at Manchester City Magistrates' Court.

He was bailed to appear at Manchester Crown Court on November 15.

Accused: Ray Teret was disgraced Jimmy Savile's chauffeur and flatmate

He stood with his hands clasped in front of him listening as the lengthy list of charges were put to him. No pleas were entered.

Teret was accused of counts involving 14 youngsters and one adult victim, who was aged 17 at the time of the alleged offence.

He was charged with 15 counts of rape of a female under 16, one count of rape, one count of attempted rape of a female under 16, six counts of indecent assault of a female under 16, three counts of indecent assault of a female under 14 and one count of gross indecency with a child under 13.

Teret, of Altrincham, also faced two counts of conspiracy to rape a girl under 16, one count of possession of extreme pornography, one count of possession of prohibited images and one count of possession of an indecent image of a child.

David Lees, prosecuting, said the offences were historic and the Crown would not oppose bail but he asked for conditions to be applied.

Emma Hassell, defending, asked for bail as Teret, who has been under investigation for 11 months, had always attended the police station when required.

His bail conditions are that he must not apply for international travel documents, live and stay each night at his home address, sign in at his local police station three times each week, have no unsupervised contact with any person aged under 16 and not to contact directly or indirectly any of the complainants in the case, none of whom can be named for legal reasons.

Charged: Ray Teret was bailed to later this month after facing 32 counts in court today

Teret was initially arrested and bailed in November last year with another man on suspicion of historic rape following an investigation into three separate claims of sexual abuse.

At the time Greater Manchester Police emphasised that the accusations were not linked to the national inquiry into abuse by shamed TV presenter Savile

As part of the investigation into Teret, William Harper, 65, of Ash Grove, Stretford is charged with conspiracy to rape a girl under 16 and attempt rape of a female under the age of 16, and Alan Ledger, 62, of Normans Place, Altrincham is charged with indecent assault of a female under 16 and aiding and abetting the rape of a female under 16.

Both Harper and Ledger are due to appear before Manchester City Magistrates' Court on October 30.
