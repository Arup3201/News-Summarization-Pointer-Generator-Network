It's official: behind the scripted smiles, the Romneys and the Obamas loathe each other.

Mitt Romney's eldest son Taggart - known as Tagg - has said he wanted to punch Barack Obama during Tuesday's fiery debate in Long Island, New York. 

His frank admission - delivered with a laugh during a local radio interview - came after it emerged that Michelle Obama broke the debate rules to clap when moderator Candy Crowley took her husband's side on whether he had described the Bengahzi attack as a terrorist act.

Clash: Mitt Romney and Barack Obama were locked in a ferocious fight during Tuesday night's debate

Rancour: The two candidates are believed to harbour consider personal animosity towards one another

At times in the debate it seemed as though Obama and Romney might have a physical confrontation as they circled each other like gladiators in a ring, wagged their fingers and interrupted each other.

Each accused the other of playing fast and lose with the facts. When Romney said that the president was 'completely and totally wrong', Obama shot back: 'Governor, that’s not true.'

The encounter was perhaps the most rancorous in U.S. presidential debate history. The two men have made little secret of their disdain for each other.

During the 2008 campaign, Obama - who expected Romney to be the Republican nominee that year - was privately scathing about the former Massachusetts governor.

Listen to Tagg's comments amount about 'taking a swing' at Obama

In an interview with a North Carolina radio station, Tagg Romney was asked by host Bill LuMaye how he feels when Obama accuses his father of being 'a liar'.

He responded with a laugh: 'Jump out of your seat and you want to rush down to the debate stage and take a swing at him.

'But you know you can’t do that because, well, first because there’s a lot of Secret Service between you and him, but also because this is the nature of the process. They’re going to try to do everything they can do to try to make my dad into someone he’s not.

'We signed up for it. We've got to kind of sit there and take our punches and then send them right back the other way.' A recording was obtained by Buzzfeed.

Dismissal: During his mother's appearance on The View (left), Josh Romney (right) said that he'd been 'slugged' a couple times by Tagg and 'the President has nothing to worry about'

Appearing on The View, Tagg's younger brother Josh dismissed the remark as nothing more than a harmless joke.

'I've
been slugged a couple of times by that brother and let me tell you 
President Obama has nothing to worry about,' he quipped.

'It's hard when you're in this process to see your dad get beat up out there... you take it pretty personally.

'I think that's something he was saying off the cuff and I assure you he didn't mean it.'

Tagg Romney, 42 and a father of six, is said to have taken on an increasingly pivotal role in his father's campaign.

After
the debate, he tweeted: 'Another great debate dad. More likable, right 
on the issues. Drove home that Obama's rhetoric doesn't match his 
record.'

In the interview, 
he also revealed that the former 2002 Winter Olympics supremo gets 
nervous before the high-stakes debates. 'He's terrified before he gets 
out there,' he said. 'Terrified is too strong of a word, but he's like 
anybody. He gets butterflies a little bit.'

A Romney spokesman said that Tagg Romney's comment was 'all in jest' and should not be taken seriously.

This is not the first time that one of the candidate's five sons has made headlines for off-the-cuff comments made on the campaign trail.

In December, Matt Romney joked that his father would release his tax returns 'as soon as President Obama releases his grades and birth certificate'.

He
was quick to deny that he was buying in to the 'birther' conspiracy 
theory, taking to Twitter to apologise: 'I repeated a dumb joke. My 
bad.'

Notwithstanding a 
couple of controversies, all the Romney sons have been regularly seen on
the campaign trail - despite having their own families and careers.

Tagg - the only son who urged Mitt to run again for President after he lost in 2008 - is considered teh ringleader, playing a key role in fundraising and strategy.

Matt has said that he sees the family's tole as keeping Mitt sane by indulging his sense of humour and playing games with him.

Josh is believed to have political ambitions of his own, a rumour supported by his frequent campaign speeches on behalf of his father.

Ben is less involved with the campaign, as he is hard at work as a radiologist in Utah, but he has joined his brothers for interviews designed to show the candidate's human side.

Craig, the youngest son, is fluent in Spanish, and has therefore taken on the specific role of boosting his father's standing among the Latino voters who could be crucial in next month's election.
