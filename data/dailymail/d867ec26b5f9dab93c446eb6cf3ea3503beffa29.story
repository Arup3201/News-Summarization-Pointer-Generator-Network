A man has miraculously cheated death after being hit by a 15 tonne lorry thanks to a dedicated team of 34 doctors and nurses.

Lewis Godfrey, 23, suffered such horrendous injuries that doctors pronounced him dead twice. The smash had left him so badly injured his insides were left strewn across the road and he was rushed to hospital with his body parts held together in a blanket.

Dr Nicholas Foster, who was working as a 
volunteer GP with paramedics was the first doctor to treat Mr Godfrey.

Dr Foster said: 'He had already died at 
the scene. When I got there, I saw the most horrific injuries - he had 
been ripped open.

'The level of trauma was so massive he shouldn’t have made it. I knew I had to stop the bleeding, so we put him back together and wrapped him up to keep him in one piece.'

Mr Godfrey had a substantial head injury and his skin had been ripped
off his body in a band about a foot wide. His bowel had been damaged 
and his bladder ripped off.

The young man from Loughborough, Leicestershire, went on to spend 16 days in
a coma. He was expected to have brain damage and never to walk again.

But five months after the horror smash he has made a remarkable recovery thanks to the team of medical staff at Nottingham Queens Medical Centre. This included six doctors, 18 nurses, three health care assistants, two physiotherapists, two occupational therapists and three healthcare managers.

Each member of staff played their 
part from Shane MacSweeney, the consultant vascular surgeon who repaired
Lewis' veins and arteries, to Joanne Cooper, the senior physiotherapist
who helped him walk again.

Mr Godfrey said: 'I’m lucky 
and my heart goes out to everyone single person that helped look after 
me. Without them I wouldn’t be here today.'

He added: 'It has taken a while for everything to sink in. Sometimes I can’t believe I’m here. I can’t remember anything from the fight or the accident, but I am really shocked when my dad tells me bits about what happened.

'I think it’s probably just as well I can’t remember anything. I was gutted when the doctors told me I would never walk again, but I was just glad to be here.

'I was determined to get my life back on track now, and with the help of a lot of people, I’m now able to walk around again.'

Mr Godfrey, a cable technician, was 
on a night out on June 2 when he was attacked by a group of men - who 
punched him in the head and pushed him into the road, where he was 
dragged under the wheels of a lorry.

He continued to be dragged along as the truck as the driver was unaware he had hit someone, 

A doctor pronounced Mr Godfrey dead at the scene after his heart had stopped beating - but incredibly, he came back to life.

In the ambulance - as his body was held together by a blanket - his heart stopped again, but paramedics battled to restart it.

He suffered from huge blood loss, severe head injuries, a broken pelvis and ripped all of the muscle off his upper right leg.

A titanium plate was inserted into his skull to keep the shape of the head relatively normal.

He had skin removed from his leg for a graft (pictured) to cover a band about a foot wide where his skin had been ripped away

He has since taught himself to walk again

On the night he was admitted to the Queens Medical Centre he was operated on by surgeon, Mr Daren Forward.

Mr Forward said: 'When he came in it was clear he’d been crushed under a lorry. He had a bleed in his head, with a substantial head injury.

Five months after the horrific smash Mr Godfrey has made a full recovery, thanks to staff at the Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham.

As well as undergoing emergency surgery, the 23-year-old has had a skin graft to repair his thigh.

He also had a titanium plate inserted into his skull to keep the shape of his head relatively normal.

Prior to going home, he also required extensive physiotherapy to walk again - and succeeded, despite initially being warned he may be paralysed.

'The skin had essentially been ripped off his body in a band about a foot wide. His bowel had been damaged and his bladder ripped off.'

Mr Godfrey said: 'When they told me I
wouldn’t be able to walk again it was overwhelming. But with some help I
managed to learn to walk again in six months.

'It was a strain at first - I couldn’t even feed myself but it’s a lot better now.'

Mr Godfrey's father Graham, 48, said: 'When we first arrived at the hospital, we were only allowed to see Lewis very briefly.

'They draped a sheet over him to cover his injuries, and I held his hand for a bit, and whispered in his ear to keep fighting.

'There were at least 12 tubes in him, and there was a huge bandage wrapped around his head.'

Five months on, Mr Godfrey is well on the road to recovery. Although he faces further surgery and physiotherapy he hopes to be back at work by January.
