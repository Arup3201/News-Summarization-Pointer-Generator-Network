For all his bravado about his drug use in his new memoirs, Stephen Fry appears to have shrunk from revealing all the famous places where he has taken cocaine.

The list, in his new book More Fool Me, includes Buckingham Palace, the House of Lords and Windsor Castle. 

But Fry left off two high-profile locations he had previously admitted to, that could land him in trouble.

In his new book More Fool Me, comedian Stephen Fry, 57, (pictured) admits taking cocaine at a number of high-profile institutions including Buckingham Palace, the House of Lords, Windsor Castle and at The Ritz

However, he fails to mention in the book that he took it at the White House (pictured) and at 10 Downing Street

In a radio interview in 2012, Fry claimed he had also taken the class A drug in the White House and at 10 Downing Street.

He told New York station WNYC: ‘I thought I might begin my next book by having simply a list of all the places where I’ve taken a line of cocaine. 

'Like a bathroom in Buckingham Palace, in the gents in 10 Downing Street, in the White House, in this place, in this place.’ 

Fry, 57, did not identify which president or prime minister were in office at the time, and a reluctance to embarrass the politicians may explain why he left the locations off the list.

Admitting criminal behaviour in the White House could also have serious repercussions for the actor.

America can bar anyone who has admitted drugs offences from entering the country, even if they have not been charged.

Fry, 57, (pictured meeting The Queen earlier this year) appeared to forget when writing his new book that he already admitted that he had taken the Class A drug at the two high-profile locations in a radio interview in 2012
