She’s declared herself an authority on canapes, cricket and tennis. 

So it’s perhaps no surprise that Pippa Middleton’s new column has been greeted with ridicule, after she wrote about her new passion for boxing. 

The Duchess of Cambridge’s sister claims she took it up because of the ‘prospect of a more svelte silhouette’, saying it helps with ‘toning up arms, bums and tums, and banishing bingo wings, back fat and booze blubber’.

'Toning up': Pippa, pictured at weekend society wedding, has described in a new sports column how she attended a grimy sports club in South London which was 
'not the sort' she was familiar with for a boxing class

And Miss Middleton, 30, can’t resist mentioning how she arrives ‘inappropriately dressed’ in ‘slinky workout attire’.

In an apparent attempt to gain credibility, she describes how the grimy club in South London is ‘not the sort I was familiar with: no VIP areas here’.

Readers promptly went online to mock the piece on Twitter.

One user wrote: ‘Most cringe-worthy column ever?’ while another said the column ‘starts like a bad novel and doesn’t get any better’.

Criticism: But despite her love of sport and keeping fit, many criticised Pippa Middleton, pictured running the GE Blenheim Triathlon at Blenheim Palace in 2011, for writing the most 'cringe-worthy column ever'

The column called Sport and Social, which was printed at the weekend in the Daily Telegraph, is Miss Middleton’s latest foray into journalism, after she turned food writer for Waitrose magazine, columnist at The Spectator and contributing editor at Vanity Fair, producing articles on cricket and tennis.

In Sport and Social, she seemed to be in a poetic mood, writing: ‘The air was heavy and sweet with the sweat of adrenaline-fuelled bodies.’  For her it is ‘pure but pleasing agony’.

Miss Middleton, who at the weekend was a guest at a society wedding, also attended by Princes William and Harry, describes a conversation with ‘a young Jamaican’, adding: ‘For many troubled youngsters from the streets and broken families, [the club is] a place to learn, focus and have a purpose.’ 

She concludes she now sees boxing with ‘fresh and approving eyes’.
