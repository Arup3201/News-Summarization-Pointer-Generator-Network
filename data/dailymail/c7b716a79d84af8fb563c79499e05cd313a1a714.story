Two years ago, after Roberto Mancini delivered Manchester City’s first league title since 1968, this lot took their foot of the gas.

They coasted through the season, finishing 11 points behind Manchester United in the Barclays Premier League. Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Ajax finished them off in group stages of the Champions League.

Those in power at City vowed that it would never be allowed to happen again.

All smiles: Manchester City celebrate Sergio Aguero's strike during the 3-1 win over Liverpool at The Etihad

This team, who saw off the threat of Liverpool last season, have been reconstructed under Manuel Pellegrini. They have the mentality of champions. Just look at the substitutes bench, where Bacary Sagna, Aleksandar Kolarov, James Milner, Fernandinho, Jesus Navas and Sergio Aguero keep each other company.

‘I came here because they are the best team in the country,’ claimed Sagna in his first interview with the club’s matchday programme. It is hard to disagree.

This team look like they mean business, which is just the way we want it after Chelsea opened the season with two victories. 

In the hotseat: Manuel Pellegrini has put together a Manchester City team who have the mentality of champions

It is too early in the season for anyone to start pulling away in the Premier League. The hunger is there, underpinned by the brisk and purposeful passing of Yaya Toure at the heart of City’s midfield last night.

Liverpool midfielders Philippe Coutinho and Joe Allen, in for Lucas Leiva, never got near him. When City score, as they did 102 times in the Premier League last season, no-one in the crowd looks at each other agog any more.

Yes, it really is happening.

When Stevan Jovetic follows his opener with goal made from the sweetest of moves, it is normal service. Last night, at the Etihad, it was resumed. Jovetic was exceptional, providing the classiest moment of the match when his backheeled flick to Nasri left Liverpool’s defence flat-footed. He scored and City, who made 19 passes together in the move, felt unstoppable.

There will be times when it feels routine, particularly for those who criss-cross the country to watch the champions on their travels.

At St James’ Park, on the opening weekend, it felt and looked like they were always in control. Perhaps they are saving themselves, sparing their legs as they prepare for the 38 game assault on the Premier League and the travelling that will come with their Champions League dream.

They have yet to make an impression on the competition, but the draw for the six group games, all played before Christmas, is on Thursday. It is time for City to go deep into the competition after assembling one of the strongest squads in Europe. Irrespective of their inexperience at this level, they have to do better.

City’s fans, all 40,000-plus inside this stadium, operate in real-time these days. This team can live with the best now, they proved that with this determined performance against Liverpool.

The Community Shield, the half-baked effort at Wembley earlier this month where they lost 3-0 to Arsenal, has already been forgotten.

City are only going to get bigger now that they are sitting on two Premier League titles.

At the top of the South Stand, the scaffolding is in place as the club get to work on adding another 6,000 seats to the stadium.

Next summer it will be the turn of the North Stand for some cosmetic surgery, given a facelift as they plan for the future.

In the boardroom suite, where the great and good can mingle with chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak or club ambassador Mike Summerbee on matchday, they have relaxed the rules. Suit and tie is out this season, with jeans and smart trainers allowed, even in the posh part.

On the pitch, they look like the sharpest team in town.
