Kim and North West, Beyonce and Blue Ivy, Kate and Prince George, we are often exposed to photos of idyllic parenthood.

But one photographer was determined to uncover the real chaos that most families suffer at the hands of their young children.

Danielle Guenther, from New York, wanted to showcase the sentiment that parenthood isn't a walk in the park with her photo series Best Case Scenario.

Danielle Guenther has created a series of photographs that capture the true chaos of parenting - including struggles in supermarkets

The collection of images sees parents dealing with the most testing of situations, from dinners out with their kids to the simplest of tasks - such as crossing the road - ending in anarchy.

Danielle, who has a five-year-old son, began creating her comedy photographs after attempts to take traditional family portraits would 'spiral out of control'.

She said it was one particularly trying session that saw her move on to her humorous family portraits.

The series aims to capture the true struggles parents face on the daily with the simplest tasks - such as crossing the road

Danielle began her series after several traditional family portrait sessions spiralled out of control. Left, a family meal in a restaurant with children eating spaghetti and a mum screaming. Right, a mum tries to shower as her little boy draws on the glass - while a baby looks on

This photo 'Parenting is exhausting' was the first taken in the series after clients at a photo shoot asked the photographer to 'take a funny one'

She told Popsugar: 'I have a regular client that I photograph, and I was over at her house. It was at the end of the session, and the mom, [who] is always a total blast, just laid down on the couch, and I [said] we should do a funny one. 

'She has a wonderful sense of humor, [and] she was all about it! And then it just spiralled out of control in a really great way.' 

The result was Danielle's first photograph of the series called 'Parenting is exhausting' which sees a couple flopped on the sofa while their kids wreak havoc. 

Although the images are hugely exaggerated Danielle hopes to capture the difficulties parents face - such as balancing everything at once

Danielle wanted to strip away the pristine facade that often comes with family portraits in her series

Many of Danielle's images focus mainly on the  mum's struggle with getting children ready

From this successful experience, the photographer was inspired to strip away the pristine facade from family portraits in order to reveal the pandemonium that often accompanies everyday life with small children. 

Although the images are humorously exaggerated, Danielle hopes to capture many of the feelings that parents may experience as they try to balance everything from work and chores to sleep and childcare.

Danielle's unorthodox approach to family portraits has proven popular.  After seeing some of Guenther's creative shots other parents began reaching out to the photographer to request their own 'chaotic portraits'.

The photographer is a mother herself so the series is particularly personal - including this shot of parents trying not to disturb their baby

Her photos have become so popular that Danielle now regularly photographs unpredictable family situations - in this one, a new father is pictured holding a sleeping baby as he reaches for his mobile phone

Danielle says that although parenting can be really ugly there are some really beautiful moments

Since then, Guenther has been kept busy photographing the unpredictable moments of many different families.

Danielle said she believed it was the honesty of her photographs that makes them so enchanting.

'This is real, this is life, this is parenting. Parenting is so ugly, but there are moments that are so beautiful. Just when you think you have it under control and you're like, "Oh, yeah, this is great. My kid's using his manners," they slam the door in your face and they scream at you! 

'But nothing in life is perfect.'
