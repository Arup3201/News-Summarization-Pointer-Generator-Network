A fourth high school student has come forward claiming 24-year-old former math teacher Meredith Powell sexually abused him during her time at Washington's Lincoln High School.

Powell was arrested in February and then confessed to performing sex acts with multiple students, one as young as
 15 years old, inside her locked classroom, as well as sending them 
sexualized pictures of herself.

She previously faced two counts of child rape and one count of communication with a minor for immoral purposes.

Meredith Powell is accused of sending naked photographs of herself in the bathtub, sending sexual text messages and exchanging furtive kisses exchanged during a Lincoln High School assembly. She also allegedly engaged in oral sex in her classroom

With these new allegations, she now faces a new charge for sexual misconduct with a minor.

KOMO News
 reports that court documents detail how Powell allegedly engaged in sex
 with a then 17-year-old student in her class after he asked her about 
raising his math grade.

The new victim confessed to his mother after she noticed a change in his behavior and saw the story about Powell on the news.

Detectives interviewed the unidentified victim last week.

The district is devising a support plan for each student and their family, including counseling.

'These are very difficult circumstances for the victims and their 
families, so we design a custom plan for each student based on their 
particular needs,' Dan Voelpel with the Tacoma School District.

Tacoma police initially began Powell after learning that she wrote a letter to one of the boyâ€™s girlfriends apologizing for 'promiscuous' and 'unprofessional' drunken text messages she exchanged with one of the boys.

Powell was arrested and placed on unpaid leave.

Police said Powell began a relationship with the three students - who are between the ages of 15 and sixteen - in January.

Powell
 allegedly told police the relationships began when she was intoxicated 
and sent a text to the students, saying they were 'hot', following 
back-and-forth communication.

Powell
 said she apologized to the students the next morning, and also sent a 
letter to one of the defendantâ€™s girlfriends in an attempt to explain 
what happened.

After interviewing the victims, who said they had sexual contact with Powell behind a lock door in her classroom, police again interviewed Powell.

She allegedly admitted to engaging in oral sex with one of the students and other sex acts with another at different times in late January.

She also sent at least one of the victims a Snapchat photo of her in the bathtub.

She told police she knew her actions were wrong, and that she would apologize to the studentâ€™s parents if she could.

Powell was hired by the Tacoma Public School district in September 2012.

Meredith Powell is described as an excellent teacher and family-oriented

She is a graduate of Sequim High School.

She was released from Pierce County Jail under her own recognizance following her first court appearance.

One student, Tabitha Maxine, wrote on the Facebook page 'Free Powell' that Powell was an excellent teacher and the allegations were 'bologna'.

'Miss Powell is such a caring and amazing math teacher, she has so much patience with those that are struggling to learn and she brings so much life and energy into her classroom with her every day,' she wrote.

'I'm absolutely appalled at the audacity of the student who accused her of such a horrible crime.'
