A mother who won £95,000 on Deal or No Deal has been charged with benefit fraud.

Caroline Banana, 40, allegedly failed to tell authorities about her win on the television gameshow and continued to claim £5,000 in state handouts.

By law, benefit claimants must tell the Department for Work  and Pensions if, through windfall  or inheritance, they come into enough money to push their bank balance over £16,000.

In the hot seat: Banana is accused of failing to tell authorities about her winnings from Channel 4's show Deal or No Deal

Banana, who was born in Zimbabwe, is now due to appear in front of magistrates later this month.

She has offered to repay  the money, but council officials have continued with the prosecution regardless.

Banana won the cash on the Channel 4 
programme just over  a year ago, telling viewers she would use her good 
fortune to  buy her own home and help her family in Africa.

After her win, the mother of two, 
from Stoke-on-Trent, hugged host Noel Edmonds and posed for pictures 
with him and her husband Michael, 48.

Banana was offered £95,000 by the show's Banker in return for her unopened box - which was worth only £75,000

On the show, each contestant is assigned a numbered box which contains a cash value unknown to them or the audience. 

During the game, they reject the 
other sealed boxes, which contain amounts ranging from 1p to £250,000, 
one by one, hoping not to lose the higher value sums.

The show’s mysterious ‘banker’ 
regularly tries to tempt the contestant to ‘deal’ by making offers to 
buy their box depending on which sums remain in the game.

Caroline Banana struck lucky on Deal Or No Deal but now faces prosecution by Stoke-on-Trent City Council over alleged overpayment of benefits

Banana’s box originally contained £250,000 but she accepted a swap that left her with a box containing just £5,000.

After initially rejecting a £35,000 offer from the banker, she then sold it to him for £95,000.

She said at the time: ‘I felt a  bit nervous [appearing on the show] as it was the moment I was waiting for.

‘When I was walking on stage I could feel myself trembling but when I stood next to Noel I calmed down a little bit.

‘I was thinking that I was not a lucky person but something made me carry on.’

A statement on the show’s website 
said the win meant ‘Caroline can buy a home, allow Michael  to finish 
his degree and help her family back in Africa’. Just 14 months after her
television appearance, however, Stoke-on-Trent  City Council accused 
her of being a benefit cheat.

A council worker said: ‘She has offered to repay the money but we still intend to prosecute her on fraud charges.’

It is alleged Banana was overpaid £5,000 in benefits, including housing and council tax benefit, between November 2011 and 2012.

Before the summons had been served to
her, Banana wrote on her Facebook  page: ‘I am not aware  of any court 
case. I just know that  I agreed to pay [back] overpayments from the 
council and set up a direct debit.’

She is due to appear at North Staffordshire Justice Centre on February 20.
