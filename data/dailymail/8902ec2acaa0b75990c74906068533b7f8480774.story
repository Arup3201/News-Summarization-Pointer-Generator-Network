School summer holidays have not yet ended, but one British town has already begun the countdown to Christmas.

Tenterden in Kent has put up and turned on their Christmas lights 115 days before December 25.

The Christmas lights switch-on was announced online by town councillor Sue Ferguson, who posted a photo of the lights and said: ‘Tenterden Christmas lights going up!!’

A bit early, perhaps? Christmas lights are already blazing in Tenterden, Kent, four months before the big day

Eager: Sue Ferguson and Jonathan Medes, from Tenterden Chamber of Commerce, with the contractors who put the Christmas lights up

Residents took to Twitter to express their surprise at the decorations appearing before summer had finished.

Andy Nicholason tweeted: ‘Apparently Tenterden have got some Christmas lights up already in the High Street.’

Another, Simon Abbott, 43, said: ‘It’s still more than 100 days until Christmas and the sun is still blazing away.

‘Nobody wants to think about the cold winter coming up - we want to enjoy the sun while it lasts not start thinking about presents, turkey and snow.’

The switch-on is part of an experiment by the council to look into how to keep the cost of celebrating Christmas low, after £15,000 worth of lights were stolen last year.

The Tenterden Chamber of Commerce rigged up the lights as a trial and plan to add lights and decorations to nine other trees in the coming weeks.

A tweet from Tenterden Town added: ‘Tenterden Christmas lights coming along, are we the first town in the country?’

Jonathan Medes, the Chamber of Commerce’s events officer, said: ‘It looks pretty good. With the money we have, we will be able to light some of the big trees this year, so Tenterden will not be in the dark.’

‘The lights are timed to come on at 9.15pm and go off at 11.30pm.

‘We think we will be able to get lights in ten trees, in addition to the small trees and lights above the shops. At least there will be some impact.

‘Whatever happens, there will be lights this year. We are doing something.’

It was a similar story in Cardiff, as shoppers were shocked to big red stockings and reindeer toys on sale at The Mamas & Papas store in Cardiff this August.

The children's chain also has table full of Christmas presents and gift ideas - even though pupils haven't yet gone back to school after the summer holidays. A spokesman for the retailer said the displays will be going up in their other shops across the UK in the next fortnight.

Father-of-two Barry Evans, 36, said: 'People talk about Christmas coming early but this is ridiculous.

'I had to rub my eyes to make sure I wasn't seeing things - August isn't even out yet and they're trying to make us feel all festive.

'Shops seem to start their big Christmas push earlier each year, I think it spoils what's so special about it.

'I don't know how people can think about getting Christmas presents when the children haven't even finished their summer holidays yet.'

The Christmas products were spotted at the Mamas & Papas store at the St David's shopping centre in Cardiff.

The display features teddies, nativity kits and cuddly elves holding candy canes.

Pregnant Caroline Brown, 41, who already has two young boys and has a third on the way, said she was 'appalled' by the festive display.

She said: 'I felt like it was exploiting my children. I walked in to get a push chair and now all my boys have been talking about is Christmas.

'They keep asking how many sleeps is it to go, when Santa is going to come and if they've been good this year.'

Only 116 days to go! A spokesman for the retailer said they wanted to give customers plenty of time to stock up for Christmas

Mamas & Papas, who have more than 60 stores across the UK, specialise in prams, pushchairs, car seats, cots, highchairs, nursery furniture, bedding and toys.

A spokeswoman for the retailer said: 'With us being a parenting store we consider planning a very important thing. We want to give our customers plenty of time to make their choices and budget for what can be a very busy time.

'We are in the process of rolling this out across the UK over the next fortnight.'

But Mamas & Papas aren't the only ones who are feeling the Christmas spirit already.
