There are few things more difficult in this world than a parent having to bury their son or daughter. 

So when Freddy McConnel died of a heroin overdose in 2011, his parents James McConnel and Annie Tempest  went through months of hell.

Freddie was a talented young man who gradually succumbed to a fatal drug addiction, believing that stars like Pete Doherty and Peaches Geldof were the epitome of glamour and idolising their tearaway lifestyles.

Freddy McConnell died of a heroin overdose aged 18 

Towards the end of his life he had started to socialise in these circles. In fact, after the 18-year-old passed away, his parents found a copy of his diary where he had written: 'Peaches is coming over later and I am going to inject for the first time. Perhaps I will die. I hope I don’t.'

But in the last three years after his death, Freddy's family have sought to make something positive out of his tragic tale.

A TV programme called Addicts' Symphony  on Channel 4 tonight charts the paths of a group of drug or alcohol-addicted classical performers as they attempt to rebuild their careers and lives by performing together as an orchestra.

In the last two weeks before he passed away, Freddy McConnel mentioned in his diary that Peaches Geldof would be coming to his house and that he would be injecting heroin for the first time 

The show was the brainchild of Freddy's father James, who appeared on This Morning earlier today to talk about the reason behind it. 

A recovering alcoholic himself, James has an affinity with the members of the orchestra because of his own experience with addiction, but it is also poignant because of his son's troubles in that area. 

He said: 'As addicts we are uncomfortable in our own skins and therefore looking for ways to medicate. 

'My son was a very good musician but also a fabulous writer.

'He was always very bright and gifted and if he didn’t want to do something he wouldn't, but if he wanted to do something he went after it like a terrier down a rabbit hole.

'Even in the way he gulped his orange juice as a child, I could see an addiction personality there.

'I was an alcoholic, so I recognise it myself.

'It caused a large amount of worry because I definitely recognised the trait in him - we tried to channel it into something positive.

'Unfortunately, at 13 he started trying lots of drugs and became obsessed with a certain pop star (Pete Doherty) and that started a downward journey that lasted for five years.' 

James McConnel has taken part in a new TV programme called Addicts' Symphony on Channel 4 to try and make a positive out of his son's death in 2011 

James goes on to explain that despite his own extensive experiences with addiction and his close relationship with his son, he still wasn't able to help cure his drug addiction.  

He said: 'We were particularly close towards the end of his life, particularly those last six to eight months.

'We spent a lot of the time talking in the kitchen because he mostly lived with me during that time.

'It wasn’t a surprise, I knew he was in a downhill spiral.

'I knew he was using heroin but it wasn’t like I sat there watching him smoke it - he went to various rehabs and I was always trying to cajole him to that next level when he admitted total defeat.

'I actually think he would have got there had he not taken that dodgy dose of heroin.'

James spoke out against addiction extensively after his son's death, in the hope that it would help other people in the same situation. 

The exposure led to a TV company getting in contact asking if he would like to work alongside them on a drug-related show. 

He said: 'It was a really positive thing to come out of Freddie's death. 

'I was approached by someone at TV company, asking if I wanted to do something about drugs and teenagers. 

'But I decided to make it about something more than that, something about the road to recovery.

'Orchestral players have huge pressures to go up and perform every night, they take a pill or a drink but then the solution becomes the curse. 

'I think all of the people who took part benefited hugely, but for a few of them it was a life changing thing.

'I absolutely want to go further with the group.'
