An unemployed woman who filled out a Jobcentre application form with joke entries claims she had it signed off by a 'disinterested' member of staff.

Grace Newton, 24, wrote 'watching s*** TV' and 'heroin's treating me well' on her Looking for Work form at the Stockton Jobcentre to see if the bogus entries would be noticed.

She claims the forms were then signed off by a worker at the centre, who she accuses of being more interested in paperwork than finding her a job.

Grace Newton, 24, became annoyed with staff at her local Jobcentre after she felt they were more interested in filling out paperwork than finding her a job

Ms Newton started putting joke entries such as 'This is your last chance to pretend you care about my future' to see if they would be noticed

In the ‘What will I do next?’ section she wrote, ‘Continue to do this pointless bull so I can get the dole’ and ‘Top myself’, and in the ‘What happened’ column she penned, ‘I wondered what your particular stance was on prostitution’ and ‘Heard from ..... drum roll .... no-one!’

In another entry she put 'This is your 
last chance for you to pretend you care about my future', following it 
up in the What Happened column with 'I stared intently into your eyes.'

Ms Newton left her last job as a barmaid in London after she was unable to get time off to arrange her father's funeral

She said: 'I began unemployment if possible, positively. I was positive about my job prospects but I found the experience of going to the Jobcentre completely demoralising.

'I felt my advisor was totally disinterested and I received little encouragement, help or guidance.'

Ms Newton began looking for work near her home town of Fishburn, County Durham, after leaving her barmaid's job in London last year.

She needed time off to arrange her father's funeral, but was told her employer couldn't hold the job, so she quit.

Since then she has used her spare time to research internships, fill out application forms, and go to interviews.

But her efforts went unrewarded, and a short time later the Jobcentre called and asked her to correct her application form, a move she describes as 'the last straw'.

She added: 'This was in a fortnight when I received responses from seven job applications and travelled to London three times for interviews.

'It’s like all they care about is how the form looks rather than what is written inside.'

A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said the advisor categorically denied the entries were on the form.

When told of the Jobcentre Plus’ response, Mrs Newton said: 'Why would I add things in afterwards? I have more productive things to do with my time.'

The DWP spokesperson said: 'Every day Jobcentre Plus advisors across the country successfully help people move off benefits and into work.

'Advisors are focused on making sure people get all the help and support they need.

'There is a complaints system in place if jobseekers are unhappy with the service provided.'
