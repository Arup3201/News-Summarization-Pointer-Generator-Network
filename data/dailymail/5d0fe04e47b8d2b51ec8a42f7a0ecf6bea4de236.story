It was the summer of love for 3-5-2.

But as the last few rays of our sunshine season landed on the Stadium of Light, the celebrated system was cast in the shade.

Yes, United escaped with a 1-1 draw, but this was another defeat for Louis van Gaal’s preferred formation.

Holy trinity: Manchester United's 3-5-2 formation allows (L-R) Robin van Persie, Juan Mata and Wayne Rooney to play in their preferred positions

With Holland at the World Cup in Brazil it had rightly been lauded as, against the odds, the Dutch finished third.

Van Gaal rolled out the same system as he debuted in the United dugout during the pre-season tour of America – again, it was as if we were witnessing the formation which would define the campaign ahead, no doubt mimicked up and down the land. 

But then the real action kicked in and, after 45 unsatisfactory minutes against Swansea last week, Van Gaal reverted to four at the back.

At Sunderland, though, it was back to 3-5-2. It did not work.

Case for the defence: Phil Jones was Manchester United's best player, according to Gary Neville

For no matter the method of approach, United were repeatedly undone at the back, nerves, inexperience and baffling positional play all contributing factors.

Be it air or land, they could not deal with the advances of the hosts. Tyler Blackett’s inclination was to operate as centre-half-cum-left-back, leaving Chris Smalling exposed. Phil Jones, likewise, on the right of that back three.

The upshot was that Smalling was replaced just before the break, his hamstring having seemingly given up under the strain of attempting to marshal such a disorganised backline.

Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young were the wing-backs charged with offering protection to the rearguard. But it was their errant passing which seemed to spread panic through their comrades at the back. Young, in particular, had little care for the duty of defending, Sunderland right-back Santiago Vergini strolling beyond him on one occasion before taking up a position unmarked on the penalty spot.

Connor Wickham twice broke clear early on but failed to capitalise on the space afforded to him. There were other chances, too, the unattended Lee Cattermole blazing over from the edge of the area chief among them.

But forget systems for one moment, Sunderland’s equaliser was simply a case of abdication of responsibility, Jack Rodwell peeling off Valencia to nod home with ease from Seb Larsson’s corner.

Frustration: Juan Mata kicks a water bottle after missing an opportunity to give United the lead

Even after the break the space in behind United remained open for business and Larsson duly scampered clear only to be denied by the recovering Blackett.

On an attacking front they offered precious little also, Juan Mata – his opening goal apart - Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie all peripheral and at times frustrated figures.

The summer of love for 3-5-2 it may have been, but you get the feeling the formation will be lucky to see the autumn.
