There was a new haircut and a new role for Raheem Sterling.

The England star, who has played in various positions for Liverpool this season, assumed his latest part – as a lone striker.

Here, Sportsmail analyses the 20-year-old’s performance in the 3-1 victory against Bournemouth.

Goal threat

Brendan Rodgers' decision to utilise the youngster as a centre-forward has raised a few eyebrows.

Surely his talents are best suited to creating rather than scoring goals?

It took Sterling 20 minutes to make a mockery of that claim. The way he found space in the area to nod home Jordan Henderson's cross - his first headed goal for the club - was reminiscent of bygone Liverpool No 9's.

The way he took his second of the night echoed that sentiment.

He had five shots inside the first 70 minutes, more than any other player on the pitch.

Is his long-term future in the position? Probably not.

But he certainly showed enough to convince doubters that it's an idea worth experimenting with.

Energy

It's fair to say Sterling has been overused by Liverpool this season.

Before the Bournemouth game he had played 1,364 minutes this season - more than any other outfield Liverpool player.

Name another 20-year-old who carries that burden and workload? You'd be hard-pushed.

To be fair, he showed no signs of burnout though, buzzing around the final third looking for pockets of space to create havoc.

But there will be a time when Rodgers has to take his starlet out of the firing line. 

But given Sterling's influence, can he afford to?

Movement

Sterling, despite his lack of experience in the role, showed a real understanding of what it takes to play as a centre-forward.

Despite his ox-like strength for a man of just 5ft 7ins, holding the ball up isn't going to be one of his main assets.

Sterling's pace was a constant threat to the Bournemouth defence

His pace most definitely it is, though. He knows it, too, using it to petrify the Bournemouth rearguard last night, playing off the shoulder of the last defender as he looked to stretch the hosts.

Attitude

Sterling's been under the microscope more than usual lately.

His 17 matches without a goal ahead of Wednesday's Capital One Cup tie raised more questions.

He answered those questions emphatically. Even after his second, there was no let-up from the youngster.

Demanding the ball at every opportunity, making selfless runs to create space for team-mates and defending from the front.

Influence

With Steven Gerrard's impact on games far-less obvious nowadays, Sterling is now Liverpool's 'go to guy'.

There's an argument to say that level of pressure is far too great to rest on the shoulders of a man who has only recently left his teens.

That's how it is, though, he can't escape it. But on the proof of this display it's a mantle he is more than happy to take on.

Liverpool were at their most dangerous when Sterling was involved, just like Gerrard in his pomp.
