When a Long Island, New York, hedge fund manager reached out to his Congressman for help obtaining permits so he could have a fireworks show at his son's bar mitzvah, he received a request for a $10,000 donation two days later -- before the paperwork was secured, according to e-mails.

Now, Rep Tim Bishop is defending himself against allegations he violated house ethics rules, accused of soliciting money in exchange for greasing the wheels of federal bureaucracy.

In e-mails obtained by Politico, Eric Semler called the request from Rep Bishop's surrogate 'really gross,' but said he planned to pay up so the fireworks could go ahead as scheduled.

Quid-quo-pro? Rep Tim Bishop was asked to help a constituent secure an environmental permit and two days later his daughter sent a request for a $10,000 donation to the constituent

The political news site reports that Mr Semler asked Rep Bishop, a five-term Democrat, for help with the pyrotechnics on May 21 -- five days before his son's party -- because his attempts to work with federal environmental agencies had gone nowhere.

His 3,400-square-foot home in the Hamptons sits near wetlands that are used as nesting grounds by protected species like the piping plover. Several, local, state and federal departments worried that a large fireworks display would harm the nearby wildlife.

The fireworks firm, Fireworks by Grucci, is owned by former Congressman Felix Grucci, a Republican who Rep Bishop unseated in 2002.

Two days after making the request, Mr Semler received an e-mail from Rep Bishop's daughter Molly, asking for a donation.

Rep Tim Bishop won his Congressional seat in 2010 by only 593 votes after spending nearly $3.1million.

This year, he faces the same Republican opponent -- local businessman Randy Altschuler -- and clearly expects the race to be another dogfight.

Rep Bishop has raised $1.9million so far this year, nearly half of it from large donations.

Rep Bishop serves in New York's First Congressional District, which encompasses the exceedingly wealthy Hamptons.

Some of the rich and famous who live there have taken Bishop's side in his five terms in Congress and given generously to his campaign.

Donors include:

'Our Finance Chair, Bob Sillerman 
suggested to my dad that you were interested in contribution to his 
campaign and that I should be in touch directly with you. We are going 
to be in a tough, expensive campaign and so we are very grateful for 
your willingness to be of help,' the e-mail says, according to Politico.

'If you make a contribution before June 26th you and your wife may each contribute up to $5,000; after June 26th the most you can each contribute is $2,500.'

When the e-mail was sent, the question of the environmental permit was still up in the air and Mr Semler didn't know whether he would be allowed to have fireworks at his son's party in three days.

The permits were eventually approved and the fireworks were shot off from the roof of Mr Semler's home. However, he says, debris from one of the rocket's landed on his neighbor's Bentley and caused $7,500 worth of damage he had to pay for out of pocket.

Campaign records show Mr Semler and his wife donated $2,500 each to Rep Bishop's campaign on June 26. It was the first time either of them had given to the Congressman.

Politco reports that the request seems to violate Congressional rules.

The House Ethics Manual says, 'a solicitation for campaign or political contributions may not be linked with an official action taken or to be taken by a House Member or employee.'

Rep Bishop denied that he made asked for a donation in exchange for helping Mr Semler. The hedge fund manager's gift was simple was simply a show of gratitude, the Congressman told Politico.

Mr Semler also disagreed with Polico's take and said there was no quid-pro-quo with Rep Bishop. He willingly gave to his campaign and was glad to to so, he said.

Mr Semler called the issue a 'non-story.'

Messages left by Mail Online with Mr Semler, Rep Bishop and Fireworks by Grucci were not immediately returned.
