Accused murderer Gable Tostee has changed his name to Eric Thomas

Accused murderer Gable Tostee has changed his name in an apparent bid for a new identity.

The 28-year-old, who is facing murder charges after 26-year-old victim Warriena Wright fell from his 14th floor Surfers Paradise balcony hours after meeting him on Tinder on August 8 2014, now goes by the name of Eric Thomas.

The bodybuilder, who allegedly once told a Brisbane woman on a date that he was named after Clark Gable from Gone With The Wind, got rid of his distinctive title by deed poll last month, The Courier Mail reports. 

A police source told the paper that the name change came as a surprise.

‘You could understand if all his (legal) matters had been dealt with and he was trying to start a new life but changing his name now does seem quite odd,’ they reportedly said. 

Tostee was this week placed back behind bars after being jailed for an alcohol-fuelled chase with police across state borders in his father's car. 

He will serve a six month sentence for his actions behind the wheel while he was driving allegedly up to four times over the legal limit in July last year, just three weeks before Ms Wright fell to her death his apartment balcony.

The carpet layer, who had been out on bail for Ms Wright's alleged murder, will spend his 29th birthday behind bars, and possibly in a protection wing to prevent his potentially being assaulted by fellow inmates.

Tostee - who turns 29 in just 11 days - pleaded guilt in Tweed Heads court to speeding and being involved in a police pursuit which the court heard reached speeds of almost 200km/h and ended with sparks flying from Tostee’s tyre rims after officers deployed road spikes.

He had been over the Queensland border at the Splendour in the Grass music festival at Byron Bay, the Courier Mail reports, and was sleeping in his father’s car when friends woke him and asked him to drive them back to the Gold Coast.

 The court heard that NSW police saw a Ford Falcon travelling without number plates on the Pacific Highway at about 150km/h ans commenced pursuit, with the vehicle reaching 195km/h when they threw road spikes onto thehighway.

Tostee didn't stop. The friction with the spikes caused sparks on his wheel rims before he finally drew up about 1km back into Queensland.

A police test of his blood alcohol limit registered 0.2, or four times the legal limit.

Before he was sent back to prison, his  barrister Peter O’Connor argued that Tostee was 'terrified' of returning to prison after being ‘brutalised’ in a Queensland jail last year.

In successfully arguing for bail last November, Mr Tostee said he had been targeted by criminals in prison and that he feared for his safety.

In the court on Monday, Tostee's parents sat stunned as he was led to the cells by police. He is due in Southport Magistrates Court in March on the drink driving charge.

Since leaving the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre at Wacol in far western Brisbane on bail, Tostee had spent most of his time at his family's home at Carrara, west of Surfers Paradise,on strict bail conditions.

He has ventured onto social media once and has tried to avoid being photographed or filmed by journalists. 

His father, Burleigh Heads carpet salesman Gray Tostee and replacement school teacher Helene put up $200,00 surety with their house as collateral for their son to be released on November 20 last year.

The Avalon apartments (above) in Surfers Paradise on Queensland's Gold Coast were the scene of the fatal fall by Warriena Wright 14 storeys to the ground at around 2.20am on August 8 this year

At hearings last year, prosecutors said that Tostee's alleged actions in locking 26-year-old victim Warriena Wright outside on a 14th floor balcony was akin to locking someone in a trunk to suffocate.

Justice  Mullins told the court the case 'is not in any view a straightforward case of murder'.

Mr Tostee was arrested a week later after Ms Wright's death. Following the first, adjourned part of his bail hearing, Tostee replaced his original legal team with renowned Queensland civil liberties lawyer, Terry O'Gorman. 

Tostee's lawyerssaid that while he was in prison, he was 'always on guard' against fellow inmates.

Ms Wright died at around 2.20am, just hours after meeting Mr Tostee at Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise via the mobile dating app Tinder.

Mr Tostee denies he murdered Ms Wright. Mr Tostee appointed Mr O'Gorman following the civil libertarian's comments about the release of court documents including an alleged transcript of Ms Wright's night with him, taped on his phone, and a damning police affidavit of what occurred between the two in the hours before Ms Wright's death.

The prosecution claims Tostee has a ‘bizarre indifference to Ms Wright's death’ and that she had been affected on the night of her death by alcohol in the form of a ‘white spirit’ made by him.

Justice Mullins has made mention during the hearing of the accused’s autism and social anxiety.

Crown Prosecutor Sarah Farnden told that hearing Mr Tostee was unlikely to have been on the balcony when Ms Wright plunged 14 storeys to her death.

Justice Mullins described the Crown prosecutor's case for murder as 'weak' and 'difficult', but said a case of manslaughter would be 'strong'.

Justice Mullins said a diagnosis of autism for Gable Tostee could have a bearing on how the court viewed what allegedly happened inside his Surfers Paradise apartment on the night Ms Wright died.

'If your client was not on the balcony, it makes the murder case a lot more difficult,' she told Mr Tostee's defence, 'but in the context of what happened in the apartment, I would think a manslaughter case is not weak.'
