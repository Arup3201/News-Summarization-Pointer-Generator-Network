Elected: Sage Lovell, 16, of Marietta, was elected to her high school's homecoming court in an election believed to be the first of its kind in the state

An openly transgender Georgia teen was elected to her high school's homecoming court in an election believed to be the first of its kind in the state.

Sage Lovell, 16, of Marietta, was elected to Walton High School's homecoming court among four other women chosen out of 50 nominees at the school.

'I couldn't stop smiling,' said Lovell told CBS 46, who said she heard word of her victory while in her homeroom class.

 'My entire homeroom erupted in very loud cheering. Apparently it was able to be heard from across the school.'

On Friday night, the Walton High School football stadium erupted with applause as Lovell and the three other women entered the field during the half-time homecoming ceremony.

Lovell was escorted by her father, Joseph Lovell, who the MDJ reports has supported her journey of transformation. 

Lovell told the Marietta Daily Journal that she received support from her classmates following her nomination. 

'I’m so flattered to be representing my school,' Lovell told the MDJ, 'to be, like, able to, like, just represent my entire junior class.'   

Lovell, who was born a boy, told CBS 46 that she realized she felt differently about her identity in her early teenage years. 

Lovell said that her transformation began with her believing she was homosexual and then progressed to her realizing that she was a female and not a male.

This began when Lovell found herself attracted to men in the middle school and, in ninth grade, she came out as gay, Lovell told the MDJ.

Transformation: Lovell said that her transformation began with her believing she was homosexual and then progressed to her realizing that she was a female and not a male

Lovell said that when she came out, her peers said they weren't surprised by her announcement.

Now, in the beginning of her junior year, Lovell identifies as being transgender, however, Lovell told MDJ that a sex-change surgery may not be in her future. 

'At this point, I can’t really tell,' Lovell said of the possibility of having a sex-change operation. 

'It could change through different medical advances or just personal feelings later in life, so at this point, I’ll have to say I just don’t know.'

Jeff Graham, executive director of Georgia Equality, an organization working to advance safety, fairness and opportunity for the LGBT community, said that Lovell's election as an openly transgender student is the first that they are aware of in Georgia.

Graham also told MDJ that having transgender students on homecoming court is something many school districts need to be prepared to handle.

Graham said that if a school's student body supports the participation of transgender students in homecoming court then that student should have the right to do so.
