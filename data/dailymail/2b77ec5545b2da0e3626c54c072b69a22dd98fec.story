Violent clashes erupted between demonstrators and riot police in Italy as the Prime Minster pledged to push forward with labour reform set to make it easier for workers to be laid off.

As a nationwide strike in protest disrupted the country, pictures show police officers in riot gear charge protesters who threw firecrackers and other objects in some cities, including Milan and Turin.

Thousands of protesters clashed with police in Milan, where students dressed as Santa Claus jumped the fence at a regional government office building.

Police dispersed that protest with tear gas and made several arrests.

Today's strike saw union workers march through 50 cities, including capital Rome, to protest the government's economic reforms which they say erode their rights.

The strike, by the CGIL and UIL unions, hit public transport, hospitals, schools and civil administrations across Italy. 

Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is facing resistance from both unions and some in his own centre-left Democratic Party.

The main target of the demonstrations was the premier's 'Jobs Act', which is aimed at loosening restrictions on firing employees when companies face a business downturn and weakening the right to protest unlawful dismissal.

With unemployment at record levels and youth jobless rates topping 40 percent, unions say the burden of the reforms and spending cuts is being placed unfairly on workers and will do nothing to revive growth. 

CGIL leader Susanna Camusso led a protest march in the northern city of Turin, headquarters of carmaker Fiat and a symbolic city for Italy's shrinking industrial might.

She said: 'The government has to change its policies on employment.

'The Jobs Act and the budget do nothing to revive the economy and create jobs.'

With pressure growing on Italy to meet European Union deficit and debt targets, Renzi's progress is being monitored by EU partners. 

Both the European Commission and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have pushed for faster action from Rome.

Italy's other main union, CISL, has also criticised the government's handling of labour reform, but did not take part in Friday's walkout.

'I think it is right to strike, it is time, we need to start moving things. We need to start playing our part as citizens and workers,' said Rome commuter Loriana Blasi. 

Speaking in Istanbul yesterday, Renzi said the right to strike must be protected but insisted his tougher line is necessary to return the economy to growth and create jobs.

He added that the unions would not throw his reform drive off course.

'The future belongs not to those who are afraid but those who have the courage and the desire to change,' he said.

Riot police armed with batons and shields hold back protesters against the Prime Ministers Jobs Act in Milan 

But in a sign of discord within his own party, some members of the Democratic Party joined the marches.

Stefano Fassina, a former deputy economics minister, told Sky TG24 it was important that someone from the party marched alongside the workers.

The Jobs Act is part of a package of promised measures to revive the euro zone's most sluggish economy, whose citizens had less spending power on average in 2013 than they had at the start of the century.

Renzi believes employment laws must be loosened to boost the labour market and has made the new legislation the centre-piece of his government's policies.
