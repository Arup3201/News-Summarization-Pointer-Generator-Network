Grief: Christopher and Lisa Avery-Wright after the inquest into the death of their son William outside the Worth School in West Sussex where he was a pupil

The father of a public schoolboy has criticised his school for announcing his death to other parents before he had been told.

William Avery-Wright, 13, died after being knocked down by a 4x4 outside his school as he crossed a road to play in a rugby match.

His father, Christopher Avery-Wright, said Worth School, near Turners Hill, Crawley, West Sussex, sent out an email to parents after William had been and injured.

Then around half an hour later another email without his knowledge was sent to parents announcing William’s death - while Mr Avery-Wright was still unaware on a train from London, he said.

As he was on the train, Mr Avery-Wright said he started receiving messages of condolence via text from people who had received the school’s email.

William’s mother, Lisa Avery-Wright, had already arrived at the hospital but she was advised not to break the news of her death to her husband until he was there too.

Following an inquest into his death today, Mr Avery-Wright condemned the school, saying it had acted 'appallingly' and that its actions had caused 'incredible pain'.

They are suing the school, where William excelled at cricket, rugby and football, after claiming he should have been supervised by an adult across the road.

The Roman Catholic school, which also posted a statement on its website about William’s death, has previously said it published the information in 'good faith' but its initial belief that both his parents had been told about the tragedy turned out to be 'incorrect'.

Today, following the two-day inquest at Crawley Town Hall, West Sussex assistant deputy coroner Bridget Dolan recorded a verdict of accidental death.

No mention was made by her in her closing remarks about the way in which the school disclosed William’s death before his father had been told.

Ms Dolan had said the inquest’s focus was on three matters - the events of the day of the crash, the school’s road crossing policy and what changes have been made since William’s death.

The coroner ruled out submissions by the family’s solicitor that William died as a result of neglect but she did say school rules had not been 'adhered to'.

Outside the hearing, Mr Avery-Wright, from Crowborough, East Sussex, said: 'I think the school behaved inappropriately. They decided to announce to the school parents by email that William had died.'

'It caused incredible pain. I think if a child dies in the school’s custody there should be reconciliation and we feel the school behaved appallingly to Lisa and me in that reconciliation.

He added: 'When I was collected by the police at 4.30pm, I was getting text messages to say that William had died and clearly I had no knowledge of whether this was true or incorrect.

'It was only at 5.30pm when I got to the hospital to be met by my wife that my worst fears were confirmed.'

The inquest heard that William was crossing a road with a friend as they headed to play in a school rugby match when he was hit by a Land Rover Defender.

The driver of the 4x4, Graham Voller, said he was travelling at around 40mph in a 60mph zone with his grand-daughter at the time of the incident.

Mr Voller told the inquest: 'I got to a short distance of the crossing and through the side window I just saw someone on the side of the road. I only saw one (person).

'And then the young lad just arrived in front of the Land Rover. Just as the boy hit the Land Rover I did an emergency stop. I had little time to react.

'When I stopped, I got out of the Land Rover and looked to see the boy, and got straight on to the mobile phone.'

Mr Voller will not face criminal charges over the crash, which happened on a road he said he travelled on up to 15 times a day, the inquest heard.

William, a sporty teenager who played golf at county level, was pronounced dead from multiple injuries at East Surrey Hospital in Redhill, Surrey, on November 30 2011.

The boy who was with William when he was struck described in a statement to police how he 'froze' and how the crash had left him in 'disbelief'.

Moments before the crash, he explained how he mentioned to William that his sock was down. He told police: 'I was looking at my shoe and then after two seconds, I looked up at Will. He was on the pavement.

'I saw him running and stop, and (Will) said, "Oh my God", and then the whole thing happened.'

He added: 'I didn’t see the car before it all happened.'

The boy said he had crossed the road before without adult supervision and that he had not been made to wait for a teacher to help him across.

Alan Mitchell, a teacher at Worth School who had overall responsibility for the games department, faced questions about the school’s policy on safe road crossing for pupils.

Under the school’s rules, he said students in Years 7 and 8 had to have adult supervision when crossing the road. William was in Year 8.

Questioned by the Avery-Wrights’ solicitor, Mr Mitchell said the policies did not state what should happen if a student is late. He added: 'I would’ve expected (pupils) to go to games staff or a member of the house.'

Mr Mitchell said the policy was communicated to pupils via the bursar who would give them a health and safety talk at the start of the year. He added that staff would be expected to read policies.

Worth School headmaster Gino Carminati agreed that the road where William was killed, Paddockhurst Road, was regarded as one of the top 10 risks at the school.

He told the inquest the school insisted at the time on pupils from Years 7 and 8 being accompanied across the road by an adult, with enforcement of the policy delegated to the head of department.

However, the inquest heard statements from some pupils who were unaware of the school's policy that they should be aided by an adult to cross the road.

Mr Carminati said pupils were informed of the policy by the bursar who acts on health and safety issues, and they were reminded half-termly by housemasters and in assemblies.

Mr Carminati said: 'I believe that the policies we had at the time were adequate for what we had to do.

'They were reviewed annually, there were no reports coming through at any level to suggest that the policies were inadequate and not being followed appropriately.'

He said that pupils running late for games, as William was, should turn back to seek adult help if they find no one at the road to assist them.

Since his death, no pupils are allowed to cross the road without adult help and the school has put in place a chaperone.

The school has pressed the local authority for a reduction in speed on the road from 60mph to 40mph, and there is lobbying for a further cut to 30mph, he added.

Planning permission has been granted for a footbridge which should be built by September, enabling pupils and staff to cross to the field without using the road.

In the meantime, a temporary road crossing has been installed which will be removed once the footbridge has been built, the inquest was told.

Andrew Ekinsmyth, of West Sussex County Council, said there were four recorded crashes on Paddockhurst Road in 10 years but none involved pedestrians.

Recording her verdict, Ms Dolan said: 'I don't find in this case there is sufficient evidence to find a gross failure of basic case to someone in obvious need where the school did have a policy and did take steps even though in some respects the accommodation of that policy wasn't successful.'

She said the speed of the driver was 'appropriate' and the driver braked before impact.

Ms Dolan added: 'It appears to me, for whatever reason, William was inattentive when he crossed the road. There was an ability to see an oncoming vehicle.'

Outside the hearing, Mrs Avery-Wright said: 'We feel very strongly that we put a huge amount of trust in the school and unfortunately those expectations were not met.

'We are going to continue our civil litigation case with the school in conjunction with our solicitors.'

Worth School later apologised for its failure to ensure pupils from Years 7 and 8 were accompanied across the road by an adult.

In a statement following the inquest, it said: 'The school respects and accepts the coroner's verdict of accident.

'Her findings reflect the school's admission that the rule that Year 7 and 8 pupils should be escorted across the Paddockhurst Road was not enforced or adhered to.

'For this failure the school apologises. In the aftermath of the tragic accident which befell William, the school has secured with the council a reduction in the speed limit along the road.

'Furthermore, a bridge is under construction to ensure that the grief suffered by Mr and Mrs Avery-Wright should not be endured by any other parents. Mr and Mrs Avery-Wright continue to be in the prayers of the whole school.'
