The owner of British Airways today agreed to buy rival airline BMI in a deal which rivals claim will mean higher prices for flyers.

The deal will give BA owners International Airlines Group (IAG) more than half of the take-off and landing slots at Heathrow.

Virgin Atlantic said the airline would be able to use their 'monopoly power' to force up fares if the £172.5million takeover is completed.

Dominance: British Airways' owners will have 53 per cent of take off and landing slots at Heathrow if they take over BMI

Sir Richard Branson today vowed to fight to get the authorities to block the deal.

It will give IAG, who also own Spanish carrier Iberia, an extra 56 slots at Heathrow.

The deal will leave them with 53 per cent of the spaces at Heathrow - which compares with Lufthansa's 66 per cent hold 
at Frankfurt airport and Air France KLM's 59 per cent grip at Paris's Charles De
Gaulle airport.

BMI, who are currently owned by Lufthansa, are currently loss-making and had been looking for a buyer. IAG chief executive Willie Walsh warned today jobs will have to be cut at the airline who currently employ 3,600 people.

However Mr Walsh said the deal was 'good 
news for the UK' and said customers would benefit from new destinations 
and more convenient schedules.

He said IAG would use its increased number of slots to launch new long-haul routes but would maintain the domestic network.

They hope to complete the purchase in the first three months of next year.

Lufthansa has the right to sell two offshoots from BMI separately - BMI regional and BMI baby - before the deal is completed.

Virgin, who had been negotiating to buy the stricken airline themselves, today vowed to fight the deal.

Sir Richard, the Virgin president, added: 'Claiming that this deal is about new markets from Heathrow is a smoke-screen.

'This deal simply cuts consumer choice and screws the travelling public.

'BA is already dominant at Heathrow 
and their removal of BMI just tightens their stranglehold at the world's
busiest international airport.

'We will fight this monopoly every 
step of the way as we think it is bad for the consumer, bad for the 
industry and bad for Britain.'

A spokesman for Virgin added that they would be fighting to block the deal.

'If the acquisition is completed, it 
will tilt the competitive landscape dangerously towards BA and cast a 
shadow over the British travelling public,' he said.

'We will be asking the competition 
authorities to stop this deal and to protect the many millions of 
passengers on routes where BA and BMI currently compete.

'With Heathrow sewn up, BA can use its monopoly power to force up prices at the expense of the consumer.'

BMI, who fly to Europe, the Middle East and Africa as well as destinations within the UK, made a £153million pre-tax loss in the 12 months ending in April 2010.

Mr Walsh said that they may keep the BMI name - or they may re-brand all the planes with British Airways livery.

A spokesman for the Unite union said: 'We will be looking to meet with IAG in the immediate future to press for guarantees on jobs and terms.'

BMI was staring financial oblivion in the face before a deal was agreed today for them to be sold off to British Airways' owners.

BMI was founded over 70 years ago as Air Schools, specialising in RAF pilot training before the war in 1938.

The company celebrated a landmark in 1979 when it carried over one million passengers in a single year.

As the airline industry expanded rapidly, their customer numbers grew to 6.5million by the end of the 1990s.

They now operate almost 2,000 commercial flights per week.

In 2002, the airline launched the budget subsidiary BMI Baby and in 2007 it introduced numerous mid-haul flights to the Middle East and Russia.

It has a total of 60 aircraft serving three divisions, BMI Mainline - the unit BA is most interested in - BMI Regional and BMI Baby.
