Latest fatality: Cody Talanian, 17, was in critical condition immediately after the crash but was pronounced dead late Sunday night

The teenage death count in car crash over the weekend in Long Island has now risen to five after one of the survivors who was in critical condition has now been pronounced dead.

Nassau County police said four of the teenagers died when the car they were in crashed with a large SUV early Saturday. A fifth teenager- Cody Talanian- was pronounced dead at Nassau University Medical Center on Sunday night, police said.

The teens were riding in a 2001 Nissan when it crossed over a double yellow line and collided with a GMC Suburban.

Two people in the SUV were seriously injured.

Police on Monday identified the teenage fatalities as Jesse J. Romero, 18; Tristan Reichle, 17; Talanian, 17; Noah Tziamihaf who also goes by Noah Franklin, 15, and Carly Lonnborg, 14.

A spokesman said the homicide squad had yet to release information on who was driving. Other details about the crash investigation also were not immediately provided.

Carly Lonnborg's relatives have launched a Go Fund Me page to help raise money for her funeral. As of early Monday evening, they had raised more than $3,800.

'Carly was the brightest, most beautiful and unique young lady. She was only 14, but in those short years she lived a full vibrant life and touched everyone who was lucky enough to have known her,' the page reads.

Grief counselors were sent to Farmingdale High School, where all of the teens were either current of former students. The flag outside the school was flying at half-staff.

'They're
 young kids who had a future ahead of them, as much as I do, and they 
didn't know that they were going to end like this,' 16-year-old 
sophomore Kimberly Kolsch told Newsday.

Nassau County police say a 2001 Nissan carrying five teens was traveling west when it crossed into the eastbound lane and was struck by a GMC Suburban at about 12:04am.

According to the paper, the front of the SUV slammed into the passenger side of the Nissan, crushing the small car.

'It was really a horrific scene,' Farmingdale Fire Department spokesman Christopher Pieloch, who responded to the accident, told Newsday.

The two people in the GMC, a man, 53, and his female passenger, suffered serious injuries but are expected to survive, police said.

Both vehicles were impounded for brake and safety checks. The investigation is ongoing.

'This has been a heartbreaking time for our Farmingdale School District community as well as the greater Farmingdale community,' School Superintendent John Lorentz said in a statement Monday.

'There is nothing more devastating than losing a child.'

A vigil on Sunday night at St. Kilian's Roman Catholic Church — about a half-mile from the crash scene — was attended by more than 1,000 people.

Parent Jeff Kolsch said he told his daughter, 'Life is short, it can end anytime. Be grateful for everyday day,' and 'we're thankful that God gives us another day.'
