From vampire facelifts to snake venom serum, it seems there's a new miracle ingredient launched every week

The latest buzzword in the beauty world is an all-natural skin smoothing secret that African women have kept secret for years - until now.

Marula oil has traditionally been used by the Ovambo women in northern Namibia for generations because of its skin smoothing and moisturising properties - and now it's hitting the mainstream.

Beauty buzz: Marula oil, which is hand harvested by the women of Nairobi, is hotly tipped to be the next big thing in skincare thanks to its anti-ageing properties (R) African Botanics Pure Marula Oil, Space NK, £60

Marula oil is hand harvested by women in the villages of Southern Africa, who use it for its medicinal benefits, in particular protecting the skin and hair from the harsh, dry weather conditions.

The oil is extracted from the plum-like fruit of a marula tree, which is widely regarded as the spiritual centre in villages.

Whilst a number of different products are made from the fruit, it’s the oil that has given the tree its special status.

The oil, which is extracted from kernels in its stones, contains four times as much Vitamin C as oranges and is packed with omega-9 fatty acid, vitamin E and flavonoids.

These essential fatty acids and powerful antioxidants, particularly the high levels of oleic acid, help maintain the skin’s moisture barrier, provide long-lasting hydration and protect against environmental aggressors.

Next big thing: Marula oil claims to be a multifunctional anti-ageing ingredient that hydrates, protects, and rejuvenates the skin (L) Melvita Bio-Excellence Moisturising Serum, £32 (R) Body Shop Cocoa Butter Beautifying Oil, £9, which both contain the oil

The high levels of antioxidants help maintain youthful looking skin, making the product ideal for dull, under-nourished skin and frequent travellers.

anti-ageing premium facial oil that hydrates, protects, and rejuvenates 
the skin.

'In the day it provides protection from UV damage, environment 
(pollution, exposure), and fatigue, whilst in the night the antioxidants 
are at their most active in healing and repairing skin while we sleep,' said Julia Noik, a spokesperson for African Botanics, who sell marula oil-based products.

Shona Wilkinson, head Nutritionist at The Nutri Centre, added: 'Marula oil has been used by women in
Africa for many years. 

'The key to this oil 
is that it is high in antioxidants and oleic acid. Because of the high 
levels of oleic acid (Omega 9) it is absorbed really easily and 
quickly. This will help provide longer lasting hydration.

'It is often 
used either on its own or added to creams to provide hydration for the 
prevention of fine lines'.

The benefits of marula oil don’t just relate to skin and The Body Shop have joined forces with The Eudafano Women's Cooperative to help change the lives of the women who collect it.

‘The Eudafano Women’s Cooperative provides income for 1,750 women in a very marginalised area of Namibia where there are no other forms of income-earning opportunities,’ Rosie Collins, a Community Fair Trade senior buyer at The Body Shop, told The Metro.

‘Women also learn how to manage their finances, the nutritional health of their children improves and they develop an entrepreneurial attitude through selling marula juice locally and marketing Eudafano’s marula oil internationally.’

Now that's beauty with heart.
