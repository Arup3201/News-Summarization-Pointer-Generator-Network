The BBC has become embroiled in another ageism row after it emerged the corporation has dropped its 73-year-old cycling correspondent in favour of a younger commentator.

Hugh Porter was the broadcaster’s cycling commentator during London 2012 when Chris Hoy, Bradley Wiggins and Victoria Pendleton all won gold.

But the BBC told viewers he ‘had moved on to pastures new’ at the start of the BBC's coverage of the World Track Championships last week.

Announcement: Cycling correspondent Hugh Porter, pictured commentating at the London 2012 Olympics, has been dropped by the BBC after 30 years at the Corporation

The Corporation added that his role would be filled by someone else - reportedly 43-year-old Simon Brotherton who has covers sporting events for Radio Five Live.

But Porter, a former world cycling champion with a 30-year-long commentating career, has revealed it wasn't his choice to step down.

He said: ‘I’m certainly not ready to give it up yet. I’m not naive, I know that things change, but it would have been nice to have bowed out with the BBC on agreed terms.

‘No one can go on for ever, but I still feel I’ve got a lot to offer. This is my sport and no one is more passionate about it.’

Porter, who has covered most cycling events for the BBC since the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, added that he was 'devastated' when he found out he was being pushed out by the BBC and had hoped to go to Rio to cover cycling at the 2016 Olympics.

He told the Daily Telegraph: 'I haven’t stepped down and I haven’t gone to pastures new. It was their decision. I’m 73 years of age [and] I hoped I would probably go to Rio.

'I love the sport. I’m not an old wreck or anything like that, my voice is still as strong as ever. If I in any way thought to myself I’m too old for this now, I would be the first to put my hand up.'

The cycling champion added that he was annoyed by the BBC attempting to make the move look like a mutual agreement.

Porter, who won four world titles in the individual pursuit as well as a Commonwealth Games gold medal in 1966, said: 'They’ve emphasised that I’ve stepped down. I haven’t stepped down. This is the thing that’s really annoyed me.

'It’s been made out "well done Hugh, he’s been a faithful servant, and now he's retired", but it’s been their decision, not mine.'

The cycling expert added he felt frustrated the the BBC's move came at a time when the sport is becoming mainstream.

Porter will still commentate on the skating at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

A BBC spokeswoman said: 'Hugh's age had nothing to do with our decision to replace him.

'Following the Olympics we conducted a
full review of all of our talent teams and as a result we decided that 
Simon Brotherton should lead our TV cycling team.

'BBC Sport judges its talent on its merit as proven by the range and breadth of our on air teams.

'We have confirmed that Hugh would still work for the BBC at next year's Winter Olympics.'

Porter's comments threaten to reignite the ageism row that has engulfed the corporation in recent years.

It comes after former Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly won a high-profile age discrimination case against the BBC in 2011 after she was dropped from the rural affairs show when it moved to a primetime slot.

And former newsreader Anna Ford last year accused the corporation of 'tokenism' after placing a number of older women on screen without giving them full-time contracts.
