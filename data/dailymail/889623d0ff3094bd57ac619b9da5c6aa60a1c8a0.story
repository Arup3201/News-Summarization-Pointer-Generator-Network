Triple killer Joanna Dennehy laughed when she was arrested, joking to officers: 'It could be worse, I could be fat.'

In an extraordinary video captured on CCTV, the 31-year-old danced into the the station lobby just half an hour after being apprehended by police, smiling gleefully at the officers around her.

Dennehy, who yesterday swore as she was told she would die in jail, can then be seen lifting up her top, flicking her hair and leaning casually on the front desk.

Dennehy, who showed no remorse throughout her trial, has become only the third British woman to receive a whole life sentence, after Myra Hindley and Rose West

The shocking video, obtained by the Daily Mirror, shows the killer grinning and telling jokes in the station.

She told officers: ‘It could be worse, I could be big, fat, black and ugly.

'Attempted murder and murder is nothing. It’s like going down for a Sunday roast, easy.’

She was branded a 'cruel, calculating, selfish and manipulative' murderer by Mr Justice Spencer at the Old Bailey as she became the first woman ever to be given a whole life sentence by a judge.

Notorious killers Rose West and Moors Murderer Myra Hyndley, who died in 2002, are the only other women to be told they will see out their living days in jail.

The serial killer appeared relaxed in the dock as she was sentenced - muttering, smirking and shouting the word 'b******s' from the dock.

Dennehy had already admitted killing Lukasz Slaboszewski, 31, Kevin Lee, 48, and John Chapman, 56.

Police officers stood by bemused as Dennehy continued to laugh her way throughout being processed

Mr Justice Spencer said that she found killing 'more-ish'.

Addressing her, he said: 'Within the space of ten days you murdered three men in cold blood.

'Although you pleaded guilty, you've made it quite clear you have no remorse.

'Only a matter of days later you attempted to kill two more men - victims chosen entirely at random. Miraculously they survived.

Jailed yesterday for life, she is now one of just three women - including Myra Hindley and Rose West - to be told she will die in jail. While Robert Moore, 56, was handed a three-year sentence

'You claim to feel remorse for those attacks but I have no hesitation in rejecting that.

'You are a cruel, calculating, selfish and manipulative serial killer.'

He added: 'The death and destruction you are responsible for has caused untold distress for the families of those killed and of those who survived.'

Police launched a nationwide hunt to find her after the bodies were discovered in remote ditches in Cambridgeshire.
