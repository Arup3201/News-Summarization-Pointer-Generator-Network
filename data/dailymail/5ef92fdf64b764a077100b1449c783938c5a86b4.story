The body of missing University of New Orleans student was found Wednesday inside her submerged car, four days after she disappeared driving to a party.

Hayley Howard, 19, was last seen early Saturday morning dropping a friend off at the university's dorms with the intention of returning home to Slidell, Louisiana for a party.

Police originally suspected the teen was intoxicated when she drove off to Slidell.

Sad news: Cindy Howard, mother of missing UNO student Hayley Howard, in beige hat, is embraced while Hayley's father James looks on as searchers look for her daughter near the Irish Bayou exit on I-10 eastbound in New Orleans on Wednesday

Howard never showed up to that party and was officially reported missing the next afternoon.

The search for Howard ended Wednesday when authorities found her silver Toyota Corolla submerged in Irish Bayou.

A body was found inside the small car, which authorities believe is Howard's. Toxicology reports are pending.

Police believe Howard's death was a fatal accident.

'It appears that she veered to the right off the interstate system and rode on the grass until she hit the water,' New Orleans Police Department Chief Ronal Serpas said in a press conference Wednesday evening.

Authorities were able to locate her submerged car becuase her cellphone pinged at a nearby tower.

'It's not at all the way we would have wanted it to turn out,' St Tammany Parish Sheriff Jack Strain said at the press conference. 'But it is the way it is. At least the family has some closure now.'

Howard's family wept at the scene after hearing the news, with many supporting her grieving boyfriend as he cried.

Howard spent her last day attending classes at UNO before going to work Uptown.

After work, she went out for drinks with co-workers on Magazine Street and then proceeded to drive a friend back to the campus dorms.

One of Howard's friends told deputies the teen stopped for a flat tire on her way home to Slidell and a passing motorist helped her, according to WWLTV.

Her car was found between campus and Slidell.
