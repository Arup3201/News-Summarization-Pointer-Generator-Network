Meet Suzy Monty, who, at 62, is the UK's oldest glamour model and cites Helen Mirren as her inspiration.

Suzy, who is a slim size 10 and 5ft 7", has carved out an unusual niche for herself, combining regular modelling work with the 'odd light glamour one' and frequent appearances in naturist publications.

And although happily married to husband John, 66, for more than 40 years, the Cornwall model says she still gets plenty of attention from admiring younger men.

'Girls ask me for pictures for their
granddads and I get 20-something men calling me gorgeous,' she told last week's Closer magazine. 'They like that I'm an old lady with a younger body.'

Luckily
for husband John, Suzy has no plans to trade him in for a younger 
model. 'He enjoys having a younger looking lady on his arm,' she 
reveals, adding: 'I'm hoping I'll still be modelling for years to come.'

Suzy, who took to the catwalk for the first time at the age of 10, modelled throughout her 20s and 30s but gave it up following a debilitating bout of glandular fever in her 40s.

But after a 20-year hiatus, she decided to relaunch her career after seeing a photo of actress Helen Mirren - who is five years older - looking wonderful in a bikini.

'I missed modelling but didn't consider going back to it until I saw Helen on the beach,' she revealed. 'I thought, "I'm 57 and my body is as good as hers".'

Glamorous: Suzy looks many years younger than she really is and rarely wears make-up

But to begin with, things didn't go 
to plan and Suzy was turned down by an agency because she didn't have 
the grandmotherly appearance they were looking for.

'About six years ago one model agency I approached said that I didn't have the "granny" look for my age,' Suzy told MailOnline.

'They missed the whole point - a woman looking young for her age. Thankfully, I have since been taken on my a another model agency which does realise my potential as a younger-looking model.'

And it seems that her move has paid off, as Suzy reveals: 'I am doing a lot of fashion shoots at the moment and the odd light glamour one.'

'Modelling is my passion,' she adds. 'It may look glamorous but actually it is hard work if you want to get to the top of the profession.

'Keeping a level head has helped. Parts of the modelling industry can be a tad egotistical.'

Suzy, who has done almost 1,000 shoots, including some 'fantasy shoots - like dressing up as a warrior in my undies' says she keeps her face and figure looking good by eating well and eschewing make-up.

She avoids sunbathing, enjoys regular facials and keeps fit by taking her dog for regular walks along the beach.

But of all her anti-ageing tricks, the most important one, she says, is to keep smiling. 'Radiate joy and people will smile back, making one's day a happier experience,' says Suzy.

'I honestly think people these days don't smile enough, I smile at everyone, even animals.'
