Camille Grammer has been granted a restraining order against her former boyfriend after claiming she was attacked for up to an hour in a brutal hotel room assault.

The 45-year-old former Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star made the abuses allegations on Twitter on Monday - but did not name the alleged perpetrator.

Now in the latest turn of events, Grammer - the ex-wife of Frasier star Kelsey Grammer - filed a declaration to a judge accusing her Greek boyfriend, Dimitri Charalambopoulos, 36, of pulling out clumps of her hair, leaving her battered and bruised, and fearing for her life.

Bruised: A judge at a California court granted the restraining order on Tuesday following the alleged incident, which happened almost two weeks ago in a Houston hotel room, days after she underwent cancer surgery

In the documents filed with a California 
court, which she supported with photographs of her injuries, Grammer 
said she was left with bruising on her wrists, a large contusion on the 
side of her head and scrapes and abrasions to her face and arms.

The incident happened almost two weeks ago at the luxury ZaZa hotel in Houston Texas, just days after the reality star underwent surgery for endometrial cancer.

Victor Senties, a spokesman for Huston Police Department, confirmed to 
MailOnline the assault was reported at around 3.30am on October 16.

He
 said Grammer was the alleged victim of an assault by a male. 
Investigations continue and no charges have been filed at this stage, 
said the spokesman.

In the meantime, Grammer filed a four-page declaration at the Superior Court Of California in Santa Monica on Tuesday, detailing her ordeal.

The pair began rowing after 
Charalambopoulos received a series of texts and a phone call from a woman, who ended up 
screaming at him down the phone, Grammer states in the court documents.

Charalambopoulos
 allegedly grabbed Grammer by the hair, twisting it around his hand, before knocking her head against the 
bed and headboard, with the declaration stating how he was 'repeatedly slamming my head and face into the 
furniture and completely immobilizing me'.

Grammer
 also claimed that Charalambopoulos - who is a lawyer by profession and has also worked as a fitness instructor
 - 'squeezed my nose between his finger and pushed upward forcefully, 
covering my mouth in an attempt to silence me to prevent me from 
breathing'.

The 
mother-of-two detailed how she feared for her life, begged him to stop 
and alleged the attack went on for between 40 minutes and an hour.

Grammer and Charalambopoulos began dating in late 2011 and are now said to have split up, according to RadarOnline.

A source told the website: 'Things 
between them had been bad for awhile,' and that Camille called time on 
the relationship 'because she was over his antics'.

Taking to Twitter on Monday, Grammer 
said she planned to press charges against a man - not named by her at the time - who 'belonged behind 
bars,' adding: 'Info will come out today that is jaw 
dropping. And women can't be silenced after being physically abused!'

'Getting
 my strength back now that I am at home and wasn't able to deal with 
talking about it after my cancer surgery or what had happen [sic],' she 
added.

Grammer was inundated with questions from her fans, including whether she was hurt.

'Yes,' was all she replied.

In another tweet, she revealed the alleged abuse happened shortly after her cancer surgery.

'Yes, it was horrible what had happened to me two days out of the hospital,' adding, 'I feared for my life.'

She also claimed to be pressing charges against the alleged perpetrator.

'Yes, working with lawyers and the police. This man should be behind bars,' she wrote.

Camille underwent what is known as a 'radical' hysterectomy after being diagnosed with early stage endometrial cancer.

The reality star reportedly had a greater risk of contracting cancer due to genetic issues.

'The surgery went well 
and she is expected to make a complete recovery following a significant 
recuperation period,' her rep, Howard Bragman, told People magazine earlier this month.

Camille was famously married to actor Kelsey Grammer from 1997 until 2010,while their divorce was finalised in early 2011.

The
 couple welcomed two children - daughter Mason and son Jude - via 
surrogate, both of whom she retained primary physical custody.
