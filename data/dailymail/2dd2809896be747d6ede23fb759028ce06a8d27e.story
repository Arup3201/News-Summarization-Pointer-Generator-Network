From getting down on one knee on the middle of Sydney Harbour Bridge to shimmying to the top of the Eiffel Tower, proposing is becoming an increasingly creative business.

But one romantic chap took it one step further by taking out a full page advertisement in his local paper to pop the question - despite the risk of a very public knock back.

Luckily for Steve English, his gamble paid off, with his new fiancee, Hayley Groves, 27, saying yes straight away.

Steve, 34, of Wickford, Essex, made his public bid for marriage during a mini-break with then- girlfriend Hayley at Heacham Manor Hotel at Heacham, near Hunstanton, Norfolk.

As the couple set out for Holkham for a picnic, the romantic estate agent made sure he picked up a copy of the Eastern Daily Press.

Once they had reached the beach, Steve suggested that Hayley flicked through the paper as he got down on bended knee.

'She said yes, [but] she was just 
shocked,' revealed English, who proclaimed his love for Miss Groves 
across the whole of page 18 in the Eastern Daily Press' West and Fens 
edition.Â 

'thought she might miss it if it was something smaller. I wanted to do something public but I didn't want to embarrass her.'

Getting down on his knees on Holkham's golden sand, Steve asked: 'Hayley Groves will you marry me? I love you with all my heart. We've been with each other for years and my love for you grows more each year.

'You are a beautiful and caring person and have always been there for me 100pc through the bad times.

'My family adores you and I cannot imagine my life without you in it.Now we are expecting our first child I hope you will say yes and make me the happiest man alive.

Luckily for Steve, thrilled Hayley agreed there and then on Holkham Beach. 'It was a shock more than anything,' she said.'I wasn't expecting it at all.

The couple, who are expecting their first baby later this year, are now planning their big day.
