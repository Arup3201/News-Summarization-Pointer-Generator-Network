Dolphins are rightly known as being one of the most acrobatic species of sea creature – but 32 humans recently proved they can give them a run for their money, with a little help from some cutting edge technology.

They were performing at the first-ever Flyboard North American Championship in Toronto at the weekend.

The Flyboard was only invented three years ago – by Frenchman Franky Zapata – so the fact that there is already a world championship for riders shows just what a splash the devices have made.

Power: Thrust for the Flyboard comes from a 'personal water craft' that creates jets of water

Nautical but nice: Competitors at the Flyboard World Championship in Toronto had three and a half minutes to impress judges

VIP: One of the judges was Flyboard inventor Franky Zapata

Riders are able to perform incredible nautical gymnastics by strapping themselves into two boots and powering themselves into the air using jets of water.

Thrust comes from a PWC – or personal water craft – with a minimum of 100 horse power.

Water is pumped by this engine through a hose that runs into a board the rider stands on and gushes out of the jets beneath it.

The pilot, using a throttle, controls the power of the water, allowing him or her to rise up to 35 feet in the air.

Making waves: The sport of Flyboarding is growing fast

Up, up and away: This competitor in Toronto looks down at the water far below  

They can plummet below the surface by cutting the power, then shoot out again by snapping it back on.

Mr Zapata was one of the judges at Sunday’s competition, in which competitors with names such as the Super Dolphin and the Swagged Out Dolphin, had three and a half minutes to score points using showmanship, amplitude, technique, diversity and energy.

West Virginia Flyboard veteran Aaron Gould told The Toronto Star: ‘Being up there flying around is every man’s dream. You feel like a real superhero.’

The winner of Sunday’s competition was Damone Rippy of Texas.
