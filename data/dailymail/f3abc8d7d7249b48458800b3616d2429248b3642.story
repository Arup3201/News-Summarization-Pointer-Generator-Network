Andy Murray gave Rafael Nadal a sobering start to the new year on Friday by handing him a crushing defeat, although a new injury concern prevented it from being a perfect afternoon for the Scot.

The French Open champion, playing for the first time since October after undergoing surgery on his appendix, was hammered 6-2, 6-0 by Murray in the season's unofficial curtain raiser in Abu Dhabi.

While Nadal was shown how much work he needs to catch up, Murray's only concern after a highly impressive display was some stiffness in his left shoulder. 'It's sore and I've never had that issue before, I'll see how I wake up,' said the 27 year-old Scot.

He will have a precautionary scan in the hope that it is nothing more than early season aches before he is scheduled to play in what is nominally the final of the Mubadala exhibition event against Novak Djokovic.

Murray had looked contrastingly sharp to Spain's finest, who has only played seven matches in all since Wimbledon, and clearly lacks match sharpness and fitness.

Having played a surprisingly tough two and a half hour match against Feliciano Lopez the day before, the world No 6 came back out and thumped Nadal - giving him a first win of sorts against a player from the top three since undergoing back surgery in September 2013.

It already looks clear that his time spent in Miami last month with Amelie Mauresmo was no less rigourous than previous training blocks under the guidance of Ivan Lendl.

'You never know how you are going to feel until you get out on the match court,' said Murray. 'Today was an improvement and I'm pleased. All the hard work is paying off.

'There were a lot of long games, it shouldn't really have been that scoreline. He had a lot of game points but I was able to win the important points.'

Nadal did threaten the Murray serve, but could not convert one of his twelve break points in a match of proper intensity. On many occasions when he pressured Murray he threw in unforced errors to let him recover.

This is what happens when you have not played much and he will doubtless improve, but it is unlikely that the official ATP season opener in Qatar next week will be enough to get him fully firing in time for the first Grand Slam of the year, which begins in Melbourne on January 19.

While no ranking points are at stake Murray will already have been encouraged by beating Nadal so easily, especially after the drubbing received at the hands of Roger Federer in the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals in November.

Little, in truth, can be read into these kind of events, but what should be encouraging to Murray is the way he moved so well at this embryonic stage of the season. There were fewer forays to the net than the previous day, but then Nadal's groundstrokes are not what you want to test your volleying skills against.

Murray's serve did look vulnerable at times but, like his vanquished opponent, he knows that many aspects can be sharpened up with a volume of matches.
