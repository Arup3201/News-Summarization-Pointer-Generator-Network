This is the dramatic moment a self-styled 'paedophile hunter' snared a pervert in an internet sting by posing as a 13-year-old girl.

Disgraced former solicitor Martin Currier, 51, was arrested after attempting to meet up with the youngster he sexually groomed online.

A court heard Currier drove 54 miles to see who he thought was a teenager called 'Jodie' after striking up a relationship over social media.

Currier, 51, groomed what he thought was a 13-year-old girl before travelling to meet her in person 

However, Currier had been snared by paedophile catcher Stinson Hunter, pictured, who alerted police

But the scene was actually a set up and engineered by notorious paedophile catcher - Stinson Hunter - who created the fake alias to snare the culprit.

When Currier arrived at the house in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, the paedophile did not find the girl but was instead greeted by Mr Hunter and his recording crew.

They filmed the moment Currier arrived at the house expecting to meet the 13-year-old, before being confronted by Mr Hunter.

In a three minute 34 second video of the encounter, Currier can be seen confirming he messaged the girl but claiming he was trying to help her.

Mr Hunter reads out messages the paedophile had sent including one that said: 'If we had a cuddle and you aroused me that could cause a bit of a problem.'

Currier also wrote to what he thought was the teenage girl: 'You might get a bit aroused yourself and I'm not very good with temptation.'

In front of the cameras, Currier accepted he had been 'inappropriate' but claimed he was just being 'cheeky with her'.

In the video, Currier, who now works as a bookmaker, is then told that the police had been informed, and he is seen getting into his car and driving away.

Shrewsbury Crown Court heard that Currier was struck off as a solicitor after he forged a client's will

Currier, from Wellington, Shropshire, denied a charge of attempting to meet a child after sexual grooming and claimed he was trapped into going to Nuneaton.

During the trial he had claimed he only went to visit the girl to 'boost her confidence'.

But a jury took just one hour of deliberating to find Currier guilty at Shrewsbury Crown Court.

Recorder Martin Butterworth adjourned sentence for reports until March 26, and warned Currier that he could face a prison term.

Following the verdict the jury heard that Currier had previously worked as a solicitor but was struck off in 2002 after he was jailed for fraud having obtained almost £50,000 by forging a client's will.

In court, the bookmaker said he had agreed to the girl's request and had planned to tell her he couldn't spare any more of his time.

Earlier, Sergeant David Wynn Jones told the court: 'When we arrived at a betting shop in Telford in which he worked, Mr Currier said to me 'I know why you are here, is this about me going to Nuneaton?'

'I then arrested him and he clarified "Is this about the ill-advised trip to Nuneaton?"'

One of Mr Hunter's team, who posed on the internet as 'Jodie', had used a photo of a 21-year-old woman for the teenager's picture on the Badoo dating and friendship social network site.

Currier also used the site, and in his first message to 'Jodie' he said that she was a 'very pretty girl' and asked if she had time for older guys.

He also wrote: 'Ever fancy some older c***?'

The reply included the mention that 'Jodie' was only 13, but the internet messages and text messages continued.

Mr Hunter featured in the one-hour Channel 4 documentary The Paedophile Hunter last year

It is not the first time Stinson Hunter, a self-styled ‘paedophile hunter’, has hit the headlines.

The vigilante, based in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, works with his team to entrap internet perverts – which have included soldiers, teachers and solicitors – by posing as underage boys and girls.

Mr Hunter, who is in his 30s, featured in the one-hour Channel 4 documentary, The Paedophile Hunter, last year.

In it he explained how his team usually pose as boys or girls in their early teens. Once they are sent explicit messages and videos by the men, the team lure them to a house to meet up.

There, they are filmed with handheld cameras and mobile phones and told to explain themselves. The messages and footage are then handed to police.

So far, Hunter has filmed confrontations with dozens of men including soldiers, teachers and solicitors and, at the time of the documentary, had seen his evidence help in 10 convictions.

Mr Hunter's methods have been both praised and criticised. Stinson's methods came under fire in 2013 after one man who he confronted, 45-year-old Michael Parkes, took his own life.

The 45-year-old hanged himself last year after being questioned by police after he was confronted by Stinson Hunter, and footage of the encounter was uploaded to the internet.

Northamptonshire Police later said they would have sought to charge Mr Parkes in connection with the incident, in which he arranged to meet someone he thought was a 12-year-old girl.

Mr Hunter told the film's Bafta-winning director Dan Reed: 'We set the profile. It’s like a rope and if they choose to put the rope around their neck and hang themselves that’s their choice.

'We’ve not pushed them.' 

Mr Phillip Beardwell, prosecuting, read out a police interview with Currier.

In the interview, Currier said: 'I felt Jodie was a fragile young girl. I did not want to go visit her as I thought it was wholly inappropriate.

'However, the texts were getting more frequent and getting a bit much.

'As she was fragile I did not want to bluntly stop it. She kept going on at me and the texts were coming every seven minutes to see if I had decided.

'I decided I might go over that evening and explain face-to-face I couldn't give her any more of my time.

'I did ask her if she had any sexual experience to find out what I would find. I made it clear I would not be doing anything.'
