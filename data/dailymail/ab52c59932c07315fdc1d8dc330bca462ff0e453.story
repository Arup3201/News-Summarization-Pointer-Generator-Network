Novak Djokovic landed a major blow in the battle with Roger Federer to end the year at the top of the world rankings as the Serbian claimed his 20th Masters title in Paris on Sunday.

Djokovic ended his week in the French capital without losing a set as he cruised to a 6-2, 6-3 victory against big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic, with the 27-year-old notching up his 600th career win in the process.

It was a telling sign 12 days ago of how desperate Djokovic is to retain his position as world No 1 that he took to the practice court less than 24 hours after the birth of his first child, Stefan.

Djokovic's victory now gives him a commanding lead of 1,310 ranking points over Federer and three wins at the ATP World Tour Finals in London, which begin this Sunday, will be enough to guarantee that he finishes the season in top spot.

Raonic served an early reminder of his raw power in Sunday’s final with a 138mph ace from his first serve of the match but Djokovic, the best returner in the sport, still managed to break before holding off a fightback from the Canadian to wrap up the first set.

Djokovic quickly moved a break up in the second set as Raonic served a double fault on break point down and Djokovic took full advantage as he eased to victory in one hour and 23 minutes before being presented with the trophy by PSG and former Chelsea star David Luiz.

All eyes now turn to London ahead of the season-ending showpiece at the O2 Arena, where the rest of the field will no doubt hope to avoid landing in the same group as Djokovic, who is unbeaten in 27 indoor matches, when the draw is made on Monday afternoon.

Andy Murray will be seeded fifth and could potentially be drawn in a group alongside Wimbledon champion Djokovic, Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka and US Open champion Marin Cilic.

After a run of 23 matches in 37 days across Asia and Europe, Murray will be glad of the week of rest in between Paris and London, which has been reintroduced this year after the two events were held back-to-back in 2012 and 2013.

On the same day that the names for the eight-man field are pulled out of the hat in London, notable absentee Rafael Nadal will go under the knife in Spain as he undergoes appendix surgery.

As well as forcing him out of the ATP World Tour Finals, Nadal has understandably also pulled out of a sponsor's poker match with Brazilian football legend Ronaldo which was due to be held in London on Thursday.
