A herd of deer couldn't help but fawn over a newly-married couple as they took their wedding photos this past weekend. 

Photographer Ian Christmann was working the backyard wedding of Lauren and Erick in Stockton, NJ this weekend when the herd of deer appeared in the woods during the middle of dinner. 

So Christmann interrupted the bride and groom to see if they were interested in taking a photo with the gathering deer, and the newlyweds agreed.

Kodak moment: Christmann says the deer were jittery, but the couple was still able to get close for a few amazing shots

'The deer were quite jittery as we approached, so I didn’t expect that we would be able to get so close!' Christmann wrote on his website. 

The photographer posted the pictures to his Facebook Sunday evening, and says the images quickly went viral. 

By Monday morning the set of images had been posted to Reddit, and landed the top link for three hours, being viewed more than 3million times in just a day.  

'A couple of people have asked if it was photoshopped and the answer is “nope.”' Christmann said. 'It’s a straight out of the camera capture apart from some dodging and burning and coloring in post.'
