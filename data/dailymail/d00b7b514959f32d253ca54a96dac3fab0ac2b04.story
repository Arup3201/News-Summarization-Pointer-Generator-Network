A charming village pub with roots going as far back as the 14th century is raising a glass in celebration after it was named the best in all of Britain.

The Rose and Crown in Snettisham, Norfolk, was awarded the prestigious Pub of the Year title in the latest edition of the Good Pub Guide thanks to glowing reviews from its loyal customers.

More than 5,000 pubs from across the country were vying for the title that was claimed by Anthony and Jeanette Goodrich, who have been running the 700-year-old pub for nearly 20 years. 

Best in glass: The Rose and Crown in Snettisham, Norfolk, has been named Pub of the Year

Readers of the annual pubgoer’s bible raved about The Rose and Crown for its food and drink, and they praised its three period bars and dining hall.

Mr Goodrich paid tribute to his staff, saying they are one of the key elements of the pub’s success.

He said: ‘They all take immense pride in being part of The Rose and Crown team, and this award is a great endorsement of their dedication and hard work. 

‘To keep The Rose and Crown a proper local drinking pub at heart has been our guiding principle throughout.

‘We are first and foremost a pub, albeit one serving great food and with delightful bedrooms, and that is what gives The Rose and Crown its very special atmosphere.’

The quintessentially English pub overlooks the village cricket green and there are rumours that it opened in the 1300s to serve workers who were building a nearby church.

The 2015 edition of the Good Pub Guide, released on Thursday, celebrates the very best of Britain’s drinking establishments. Winners were recognized in more than a dozen national categories.

It has been around since 1715 but landlord Tim Bird turned it back into a thriving pub after years of neglect.

Provenance Inns was named Pub Group of the Year and the award for Inn of the Year went to Jeremy and Vanessa Lee for their refurbishment of the New Inn at Cerne Abbas, Dorset.

The Good Pub Guide has welcomed an extra 132 pubs to its pages this year.

Fiona Stapley, who edited the book with Alisdair Aird, said that’s an indication that Britain’s pub trade is getting stronger.

She said: ‘Pubs have had a tough time over the last few years but many have weathered the downturn and there is now a new confidence in the pub trade.

‘The pub scene has changed utterly from the days of decrepit boozers with dull beer and freezer-pack food to a thriving industry that's now finding ingenious ways of pleasing millions of new customers.’ 

The Good Pub Guide is published by Ebury Press and costs £15.99.

Mrs Stapley said the winners were chosen on the recommendations of more than 2,000 readers and backed up by visits from the editing team.

She had high praise for the overall winner, saying: ‘We were inundated with praise from readers about The Rose and Crown - it was a clear winner.

‘It's a charming pub that gets it right on every level. It has three beautiful character bars serving fantastic ales. They have a huge bustling dining room and also a restaurant.

‘The garden is wonderful, they're dog friendly and they also have a play area for children. They really do cater for everyone.’
