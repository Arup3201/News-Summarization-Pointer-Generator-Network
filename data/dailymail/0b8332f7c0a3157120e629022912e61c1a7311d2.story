Tragic: The body of Wanda Buckley Davis, pictured, was found amid the rubble of her property in Grandview, outside Fort Worth following the blast Saturday night

A 62-year-old Texas mother died Saturday night after her three-story home exploded, rattling the entire neighborhood and surrounding cities.

Wanda Buckley Davis' body was found amid the rubble of her property in Grandview, outside Fort Worth following the blast, which occurred just before 11 p.m., Sheriff Bob Alford said.

Davis' husband was away on business in North Carolina when the log-cabin style home was all but flattened, relatives said.

According to Alford, neighbors reported a bang and started searching the area when they discovered Davis' house had been destroyed.

Photographs provided by the sheriff's department and the victim's family show that little is left of the home except bits of insulation and a crumbling foundation. The devastation resembles the aftermath of a tornado.

Investigators believe the explosion was likely caused by a propane leak ignited by water heaters in the basement of Davis' home, Alford said.

Foul play is not suspected.

It was first reported that no one was injured in the blast, but shortly after noon Sunday Davis' body was found inside what was left of the home.

Davis' husband Gary Wagoner was en 
route to Texas Sunday. He was on a business trip in North Carolina when 
the tragedy unfolded, Alford said.

Dispatchers received calls from miles away in neighboring cities including Keene, Cleburne and Rio Vista reporting an explosion.

Grandview is about 30 miles south of Fort Worth.

On Sunday, Davis' family mourned the loss of the loving mother and grandmother on Facebook.

Her daughter, Brandee Simons, posted a photo of what was left of her mother's home, with emergency vehicles out the front.

'We lost mom as of last night,' she wrote Sunday.

'There was an explosion at her house and she did go quickly but fortunately no pain. I loved her very much and will miss her so much. She was MY person.'

Her niece, Melanie Broyles described Davis as 'Sweet... caring... loving. She'd give you the shirt off her back.'

Residents described the force of the explosion as 'very powerful.'

'Our whole house shook,' a neighbor told WFAA.com. 'Stuff fell off the walls and broke. I thought a plane crashed thatâ€™s how much the house shook.'

Keene Fire Department chief Matt Gillin said: 'My wife and I felt it just north of Keene. Must have been very powerful.'
