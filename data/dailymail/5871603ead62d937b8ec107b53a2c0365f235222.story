Mesut Ozil will have an MRI scan in Munich as the Arsenal midfielder seeks to clear up a niggling knee problem.

Ahead of Germany's upcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers, the 25-year-old has still not trained with the national team in Frankfurt.

Despite playing the entire game at Stamford Bridge in Sunday's 2-0 defeat by Chelsea, the news will come as a concern to Arsenal fans as they seek to kick-start their season after the international break.

Ozil has played regularly for Arsenal this season and has shown little sign of an injury

Ozil has shown no major sign of injury in recent months and has played nine times this season, scoring once.

DFB spokesman Jens Grittner said on Twitter: 'Second training session without Schurrle and Ozil. He travelled with knee problems and will have an MRI scan in Munich.'

Schurrle and Ozil had trained at the team hotel on Tuesday, but the latter has now been sent 250 miles south.

Germany, who won their first Euro 2016 qualifier 2-1 against Scotland last month, travel to Poland on Saturday before hosting Republic of Ireland on Tuesday.
