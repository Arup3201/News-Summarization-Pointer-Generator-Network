Celtic hope to have Stromsgodset coach Ronny Deila in place as their new manager by the end of the week.

The Norwegian champions are digging in their heels over compensation for the man hailed in his homeland as his the new Jurgen Klopp.

However, Deila’s agent Tore Pedersen was in Glasgow to agree terms on Wednesday and Celtic hope that the deal can be concluded quickly.

To the rescue: Is Ronny Deila the man to save Celtic?

Incoming: Stromgodset coach Deila could be appointed this week

That will obviously depend on a compromise being reached with his current club as the 38-year-old’s reward for leading Stromsgodset to their first title in 43 years was a new contract until 2016.

Speaking after Stromsgodset crashed out of the Norwegian Cup following a 4-2 extra-time defeat in Tromsdalen, a cagey Deila gave little away, insisting: ‘It’s just speculation. And there will always be speculation around people who are doing well.

‘Of course I am flattered. It’s great to be linked to a club like Celtic. But I’ve been in this game for a long time, and nothing is secure yet.’

Asked how he will respond if Celtic formally offer him the job, Deila added: ‘That’s speculation.’

Big character: Deila has been likened to Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp who is well admired

Deila stepped into the manager’s chair in 2008 after playing for the club and has improved the league position every year since, culminating in a cup win four years ago and Stromsgodset’s first championship win since 1970.

He signed a new deal in the winter after travelling abroad on a training trip to visit Klopp in Dortmund.

Sportsmail understands he was originally considered as a potential replacement for Johan Mjallby as Celtic No 2 under Neil Lennon.

Asked if he had paid any visits to Parkhead, however, he said: ‘No, I was never there. I have just watched a game there once.’

Deila is credited with developing Stefan Johansen, the midfielder who joined Celtic in a £1.5million deal last January, and building a formidable team on a fraction of rivals Rosenborg’s budget.

Rejection: Roy Keane reportedly turned down the job

Linked: Steve Clarke was also believed to be in the running

Henrik Larsson, Roy Keane and Steve Clarke have all been spoken to by Parkhead powerbrokers over the role vacated by Lennon a fortnight ago.

But Parkhead sources have confirmed Deila is now the frontrunner and chief executive Peter Lawwell hopes to make an announcement on the new man in the coming days.

‘There’s nothing more we can say, we are still working on it,’ said Lawwell. ‘But hopefully we can over the next few days or at least during the next week, have something to say.

‘We talk to more people and hopefully we will get the right man soon.’

Norwegian media reports say Lawwell contacted Stromsgodset to express an interest in speaking to Deila on Tuesday night. Compensation now looks to be the greatest obstacle to agreement.

‘It’s always fun when there is speculation in the media about the players and coaches of Stromsgodset,’ said the Norwegian club’s chief executive Erik Espeseth.

‘It shows that we have arrived on the map of Europe. On behalf of the club, it is flattering.

‘But we have no comments in relation to any requests for our players or coaches.

‘Generally speaking, we think is it exciting and nice that they are being linked with major clubs in Europe. It says something that we have built the club over time.’

Rosenborg and Swedish club Malmo have been linked with moves for the talented coach in the recent past, but Stromsgodset chairman Tom Saxegaard refused to comment, saying: ‘You know for sure that we cannot comment on rumours.’
