This is the incredible moment when a Peruvian police officer crosses five lanes of busy traffic to rescue a stranded puppy.

Juan Manuel Iman Zena, 34, had spotted the terrified young dog on the busy Panamericana Sur, in the Peruvian capital Lima.

Concerned about its welfare, and fearing it could cause a major accident, the brave officer took his life in his hands as he strode out onto the highway, ordering traffic to stop, to pick up the puppy.

Video footage of the incident has since gone viral, turning Mr Zena into an internet star.

But despite his online fame, the officer insists; 'I was only doing my job.

'I could see that there was no way the young dog was going to make it back and it's amazing he even managed to get the central reservation in the first place,' said Mr Zena.

'I knew it was about to be hit at any moment, and was worried that if a car tried to swerve it might cause an accident.'

The officer orders traffic to stop and slowly approached the young dog before grabbing it by the scruff of its neck

Realising he could be hit 'any moment', he quickly carries with the animal to his motorbike across the road where he can check its collar

The video shows him starting to wave down traffic before eventually crossing the highway and slowly approaching the puppy. He then grabs the dog by the scruff of the neck and carries it back to the safety of his motorbike. 

There he puts the animal on a makeshift lead and checks the collar to help track down the owners.

On the video a child can also be heard saying excitedly: 'He saved it.' 

Mr Zena added: 'I had an easy job with the last part, the telephone number for the owners was on the collar and I simply called them and they were very grateful to be reunited with their pet.'

The video, shot by witness Carolina Carol, attracted widespread praise for the police officer from animal welfare protection organisations in the country and resulted in him being praised by his superiors. 

The president of the Peruvian Animal Protection Association, Cecilia Degregori, wrote in the Facebook profile of the group that it was great to see positive news about dogs and people in the media for a change.

She said: 'Unfortunately, we see daily reports of cruelty and indifference against animals and we are fighting to change this attitude. However I must say to this policeman, with your behaviour we are proud of you and the Peruvian police and we see in you hope for the future for change.'
