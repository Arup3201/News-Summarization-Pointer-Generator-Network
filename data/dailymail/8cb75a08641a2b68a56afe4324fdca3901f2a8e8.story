A disgruntled former Tesco worker has admitted dumping a severed deer's head on a self-service till and draping the entrails in the bread aisle.

James Hyett, 33, carried the bloodied animal remains into the 24-hour store in Saffron Walden, Essex in the early hours of the morning hidden inside a black bin bag.

He spoke to his former colleagues before dumping the decapitated deer head by the tills.

Disgruntled former worker: James Hyett, 33, dumped the deer's head on a self-service till in the Tesco supermarket in Saffron Walden, Essex, a court heard

The Tesco store worker, who was employed by a cleaning contractor, was arrested shortly afterwards.

He admitted causing criminal damage when he appeared before Colchester Magistrates' Court today.

Denise Holland, prosecuting, said: 'He was seen to go to the self-serve check-outs and was talking to a member of staff there.

'A short time later, he stopped briefly before leaving an item on the check-out before walking off. It was found to be a severed deer head.'

A bloodied black bin bag was later found in the store's toilet.

Mrs Holland added: 'At the same time a staff member in the bread aisle noticed a foul smell and found that animal intestines had been strewn across one of the shelves.'

Hyett, who was spotted on CCTV with a bottle containing yellow liquid, also poured sunflower oil into specialist in-store cleaning equipment.

Damage: James Hyett dumped the deer's head at the checkout in the store in Saffron Walden, Essex, which is next to this petrol station

The machine had to be professionally repaired, which cost Tesco hundreds of pounds.

He was later questioned by police but only gave partial responses to officers' questions.

It was confirmed in court that Hyett, of Saffron Walden, was a former employee but no reason was given for his outrageous behaviour.

Elizabeth Bradshaw, mitigating, said her client was 'very remorseful' for the incident which happened in the early hours of June 4.

She said: 'It is clear that he has pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. He is very remorseful in relation to this incident and it was very much out of character.

'It was a difficult time for him - that is not an excuse - but it is clear that there were many factors at work which are being dealt with now.'

Magistrates have ordered a pre-sentence report and Hyett will return to the court later this month August to discover his fate.

He was granted unconditional bail and refused to comment as he left the court.
