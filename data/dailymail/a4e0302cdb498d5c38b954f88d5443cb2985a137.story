A publishing company has released a colouring book aimed at children which features one of the Boston Bombing suspects on the front cover.

The controversial black and white line drawing parodies last month's infamous Rolling Stone cover in which prime suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev - currently awaiting trial for the deaths of four people, plus 30 counts of using a weapon of mass destruction - featured in the style of a hippy rock star.

The amended magazine title reads: 'Rock Him and Stone Him'.

Educational: The company behind the controversial colouring book have said they want to help youngsters understand terrorism. It contains images of Bin Laden being buried at sea

It also has spoof headlines including: 'I ran over my brother with a carjacked SUV', and 'my shoplifting mother can't visit me in jail.'

Missouri-based Really Big Coloring Books has defended it's latest offering called 'Tell the Truth - Tell it Often - Tell the Children', which went on sale this week.

The firm claims it was 'designed to help youngsters learn and understand more about terrorism as they read or colour'.

They say the series will engage 
parents, teachers, educators and children from an honest, direct point 
of reference that may elicit public response for open discussion.

Demands: The colouring book has called on Imams to acknowledge Sharia Law is secondary to the US constitution

Publisher Wayne Bell said: 'In 
regards to our initial comic publication, we listened to customer input 
and decided to cover the subject of terror.

'With
the advent of members in the national media being accused of 
"glorifying a young terrorist", our company received a mountain of 
hostile feedback and comments directed at that topic.

'We
are simply not going to put up with radical Jihadists in this country. 
As far as radical Islamic Jihad goes, you don't win now, you don't win 
here, you don't win tomorrow, you don't win next week, you simply don't 
win.

'America's not going to let you win, and we want you to know that.'

Hate figures: The book also features other controversial people such as Bradley Manning (bottom left), jailed for leaking classified documents

Defiant: The colouring book has warned terrorists 'America's not going to let you win

Included inside is a letter of declaration to Imams in America asking them to 'help rid America of radical Islam', and urging them to start a day of recognition dedicated to honouring those who have died 'at the hands of Radical Islamic Jihad'.

The edition also features a graphic drawing of Osama Bin Laden's body at the bottom of the sea.

The St Louis publisher's CBC Coloring Book Comic line of publications will feature real life 'true-to-culture' hero and villain comics.

The new title comes as a 12-page supplement when ordering older books from the company called 'We Shall Never Forget 9/11 The Kids Book of Freedom' and 'The True Faces of Evil Terror'.

Mr Bell added: 'People say they only want the truth without influence of personal opinion or hidden agenda.

'Americans are more than fed up with politically motivated correctness to the point of frustration that quickly turns into disgust, distrust and then anger.

'"Do not mislead my children; kids are smarter than you think" - we hear that often, especially from grandparents.

'People have told our company in essence: tell the truth, tell it often and tell the children.'

Three people, including an eight-year-old boy, were killed and 176 injured, 17 critically, in the attack on the Boston Marathon as the nation celebrated Patriots Day on April 15.

Pressure cookers packed with shards of metal, nails and ball bearings - a weapon favoured by al-Qaeda - were detonated near the finish line causing mayhem.

Three days later, police tracked two suspects - brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev - to Watertown, where a firefight broke out in which a police officer was killed, bringing the death toll to four.

Tamerlan, the elder brother, was also killed after being shot by police, while Dzhokhar, 19, escaped in a car, but not before running his brother over.

His five-days on the run was brought to an end when police found him hiding in a boat, which was parked up on the driveway of its owner. The Massachusetts college student was shot several times as the authorities attempted to capture him.

Rolling Stone magazine later published a controversial front page which depicted the teenager as a rock star.
