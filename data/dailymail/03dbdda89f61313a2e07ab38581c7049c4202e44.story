Annette Malocco, from the West Midlands, had the pioneering operation two weeks ago

It sounds like a scene from a horror movie. As almost every drop of blood was drained from Annette Malocco’s body, for 20 minutes she ‘died’ on the operating table at Papworth Hospital. 

Yet surgeons were saving her life. Annette was undergoing a pulmonary endarterectomy, a pioneering operation which put her into a corpse-like state as a heart-lung machine took over the work of these vital organs and her blood was removed.

Although her brain continued to function normally, with no oxygenated blood being circulated in her body, surgeons had just 20 minutes to remove clots from her lungs that were severely affecting her ability to breathe, before her organs would begin to shut down.

Thankfully, the procedure was a success, and less than a week later the 40-year-old housewife was on her way home. While the seven-hour operation might seem like the stuff of nightmares, Annette admits she had few nerves as she became one of the 160 patients who undergo the surgery each year at Papworth. 

The hospital in Cambridgeshire is one of only four centres in the world, and the only one in the UK, able to carry out the highly complex procedure.

Her operation features in an episode of the BBC documentary series Trust Me I’m A Doctor later this month.

Annette, of Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, had her surgery just two weeks ago. She first began having problems in June last year when she had trouble breathing while walking her dogs. ‘I’m asthmatic so I initially put it down to that and thought my inhaler wasn’t working properly,’ she says. ‘But within months I found I couldn’t walk across the living room without being breathless, and then I began to get chest and shoulder pains as well.’

An X-ray revealed that Annette had blood clots in her lungs. She was suffering from chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) – blockages in the blood vessels to the lungs as a result of scar tissue.

The body naturally dissolves blood clots but in rare cases they become fibrous, block the arteries and prevent normal blood flow. 

Annette was referred to Papworth and consultant cardiothoracic surgeon David Jenkins had to determine if she would benefit from the operation. When they decided she was a suitable candidate, Annette was undaunted.

‘My quality of life had gone. I’d got to the stage where I thought, “What is the point?” I was existing, not living, so I jumped at the chance of surgery,’ she says.

Surgeons perform a pulmonary endarterectomy at Papworth Hospital - which involves putting the patient into a corpse-like state as a heart-lung machine takes over the work of these vital organs

First, the patient is connected to a heart-lung bypass machine that diverts the circulation. The same machine is used to cool the body from 37C to 20C to prevent damage to vital organs. This also reduces the blood circulation so that for about 20 minutes there is no blood in the body at all. 

The heart stops beating, meaning the body is effectively lifeless. Five litres of blood a minute are usually pumped into the pulmonary arteries, which is why it is vital that there is no blood to obstruct the surgeons’ view as they open the blood vessels and then remove the artery lining to clear the clots.

Once this has been done, the patient is warmed up to a normal body temperature and taken off the bypass machine, a process that can take two hours.

The hospital in Cambridgeshire is one of only four centres in the world, and the only one in the UK, able to carry out the highly complex procedure

Mr Jenkins says: ‘To anyone watching the operation, the patient has flatlined, nothing is working, there is no blood going to the brain. They are put into a suspended state called deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.

‘We did a complex trial at Papworth and discovered that after this operation, patients’ cognitive skills were not impaired – in fact in many cases they improved.’

The condition affects both men and women, and Mr Jenkins has operated on sufferers aged between 14 and 89. Patients usually spend at least two days in intensive care but generally return home after two weeks. They must take blood-thinning drugs for the rest of their life to prevent further clots.

‘I feel as if I’ve been given a new lease of life,’ Annette says. ‘Within days of the operation I could breathe properly and without pain. I’m having a bit of physiotherapy to help with the healing where the surgeons made an incision in my sternum, but apart from that I feel amazing.

‘I think in some ways it has been tougher for my husband Trevor because he’s had to put a brave face on things to support me, but now we feel we have a future to look forward to.’

Ask a stupid question 

Do some people never cry?

Dr Adam Perkins, lecturer in the neurobiology of personality at The Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King’s College London, says: ‘Our emotional reactions are influenced by two structures near the base of our brain known as the amygdala. 

'Damage to this area causes impaired emotional reactions. However, there is naturally variance in amygdalar reactivity between individuals. People at the low end of the scale would have relatively flat, unemotional personality profiles.’
