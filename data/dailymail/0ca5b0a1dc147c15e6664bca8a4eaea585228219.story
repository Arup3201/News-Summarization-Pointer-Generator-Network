Roberto Mancini has warned Mario Balotelli he is in danger of wasting his career. 

The Liverpool striker has scored twice since his £16million summer move from AC Milan and has been linked with a move away from Merseyside during the transfer window. 

Mancini managed Balotelli at Manchester City and has urged the 24-year-old to get back on track and not become like former Inter Milan striker Adriano, who faded away after a promising start to his career in Italy.

Mancini has urged Balotelli to realise he is wasting his talent

'I have not heard from Mario since we worked together at Manchester City,' he told Corriere della Sera.

'He was still a kid when we were together at Inter. He would do anything I asked him and he also behaved well at City.

'It has all gone downward a bit since he left City. I thought he would do well at Milan, but it didn't happen.

'Mario is at risk of following the same path as Adriano. I hope that he wakes up one morning and realises that he is wasting everything.'
