The woman who was raped by footballer Ched Evans has been forced to change her name and move for a fifth time after being hunted down by vile internet trolls.

Speaking on condition that The Mail on Sunday does not reveal her location, the victim’s father said malicious individuals continue to hunt down his daughter, and she was forced to relocate before Christmas.

The father spoke out after complaining to the Attorney General Jeremy Wright that CCTV footage on Evans’s official website showing his daughter entering a hotel shortly before the rape could be in contempt of court.

However, he did not receive a reply to his original complaint last month. It was only when The Mail on Sunday intervened and contacted the Attorney General that his office said it was now ‘seriously considering’ the issues.

The 23-year-old woman, who has a lifelong right to anonymity as the victim of a sexual assault, has been living in hiding at locations around Britain since her identity was revealed on the internet three years ago.

Separated from her family and friends, she has been able to meet her father only once in that time and communicates mainly by phone. She was not even able to exchange Christmas presents with him.

The Mail on Sunday can reveal that she was working over the Christmas period to take her mind off the ordeal as she continues to live in fear of Evans’s supporters, who are determined to discredit her and reveal her changes of name and address.

Last night, the father said: ‘It’s the fifth time she’s had to move in under three years, she is just living her life on the run.

‘I couldn’t even see her over Christmas because it’s too risky for her to visit me. I don’t even know where she is living at the moment, so I haven’t been able to give her the Christmas presents I bought her.’

Former Sheffield United footballer Evans, 26, was jailed for five years in April 2012 for raping the then 19-year-old waitress, who was judged to be too drunk to have given her consent to sex.

Despite having the right to anonymity following the jury’s unanimous verdict, her name was tweeted by Evans’s supporters and then re-tweeted 6,000 times. Evans’s official website continues to protest his innocence despite his conviction.

In a poignant statement, the victim’s father said: ‘The last time I saw her was almost a year ago, and it’s been hard not having her at home over Christmas. I just want her near me so I can protect her.

‘I don’t think the police are doing their job if she’s having to move five times in under three years.

‘Ched Evans is able to lead a normal life. He has never apologised to my daughter. Instead, his website proclaims his innocence and draws attention to my daughter every day that it remains posted on the net. I think it should be taken down.’ Evans, 26, has never shown any remorse and has referred to the rape in a hotel bedroom as ‘an act of infidelity’ against his fiancee Natasha Massey, 26.

The attack in May 2011 came after Evans and another footballer, Clayton McDonald, also 26, had been out in Rhyl, North Wales. McDonald, who was cleared of rape, had sex with the girl in a Premier Inn. When he left the hotel, Evans had sex with her and claimed it was consensual. He was released in October having served half his sentence.

The victim’s father added: ‘It’s a disgrace. I heard nothing from the Attorney General’s office until they were contacted by The Mail on Sunday.

‘She is on trial every day thanks to Evans’s website. It shows her entering the Premier Inn with the headline “Judge for yourself”. Only her face is blurred and, in my view, she is easily recognisable. Neither the Crown Prosecution Service nor Premier Inn gave permission for the footage to be used.

‘It can’t be right for a rape victim, after having endured the horrendous ordeal of a trial, to be subjected to “trial by website”.’

Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General’s office said: ‘One of our senior lawyers has been seriously considering the number of issues raised in the letter since we received it on November 12 and we hope to reach a conclusion shortly.

‘We apologise that the victim’s father has not been kept updated and we will be in touch with him as soon as possible.’
