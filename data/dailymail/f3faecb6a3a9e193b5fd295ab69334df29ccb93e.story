The new partner of a woman who had her eyes gouged out in one of Britain's worst domestic abuse cases has been jailed for attacking her.

Mother-of-two Tina Nash, 33, was permanently blinded in April 2011 by Shane Jenkin, 34.

He was jailed for life in a secure mental health unit and ordered to serve at least six years before being considered for release.

Now a second man has been jailed for beating her.

Now a second man has been jailed for beating her. Roland Alli, 32, was due to stand trial for common assault but changed his plea last week at Truro Magistrates Court in Cornwall and was jailed for 14 weeks

Roland
Alli, 32, was due to stand trial for common assault but changed his 
plea last week at Truro Magistrates Court in Cornwall and was jailed for
14 weeks.

Ms Nash, a former beautician, launched a media campaign urging other victims of domestic violence to flee abusive relationships as she tried to rebuild her life.

The court heard Alli subjected 'extremely vulnerable' Tina to a 'sustained' attack in her home on June 16.

Alli, from Plymouth, Devon, was also handed a restraining order banning him from going anywhere near Ms Nash's home in Penzance, Cornwall or contacting her again.

The attack came just three days after Alli appeared before magistrates for scuffling with a policeman on the housing estate where Ms Nash lives.

On that occasion, magistrates heard he was in a drunken rage after being kicked out of her house when he was approached by PC Ian Ridge.

Alli pleaded guilty to drunk and disorderly behaviour after struggling with the officer and was fined £35 with £80 costs and surcharge.

He was also told to pay £100 compensation to PC Ridge and given a drink banning order for a year.

Ms Nash latest turbulent relationship comes despite her becoming a high-profile campaigner against domestic violence in the wake of her blinding.

After her ordeal at the hands of Jenkin she wrote a book highlighting the scourge of abuse in the home and begged other victims to seek help and not stay silent.

‘Out Of The Darkness’ describes how Jenkin beat her unconscious and poked out her eyes at her home, telling her: 'You’re never going to see your kids again.'

The 12-hour attack also left her with a broken jaw and nose.

Ms Nash wrote: 'I sat up and reached my hand to my face... and felt my eyeball hanging halfway down my cheek.

'I touched my slippery eyeball, like I couldn’t believe it was real. My other eye was swollen to the size of a tennis ball.'

Tina told other victims: 'It’s not going to get better, it’s going to get worse.'
