World number one Novak Djokovic is through to Sunday's final of the Australian Open after a less-than-convincing face-off with defending Melbourne champion Stan Wawrinka.

The match was one of twists and turns, with an uneven performance on both sides which had spectators wondering about the energy levels and health of Djokovic.

The 27-year-old admitted in the post-match interview that the error-riddled game had sapped him of his energy after the third set, but said he still thought he had played well.

'We pushed each other to limit,' said Djokovic. 

'As was the case in the past three years, it took five sets, and credit to Stan for that.'

The match played out over the course of a curious 7-6, 3-6, 6-4, 4-6, 6-0 to a victory for the Serb. 

Djokovic said that the many unforced errors he had played during the match had disadvantaged his game, and that he had made his life 'very difficult on court'.

After winning the third set against Wawrinka, the world number one walked back onto the court, appearing not to have noticed that the set was over.

After Wawrinka netted with the forehand, Djokovic turned around and looked surprised as security ran onto the court as they usually do during the set break. 

Umpire James Keothavong had a good laugh at Djokovic as he sheepishly walked to his courtside chair.  

Djokovic was cloyed by the tension of a semi-final that turned in the decider when the Swiss missed his chance of an early breakthrough and subsided from there. 

The reaction at the end was more one of relief.

This move had some commentators wondering whether his flagging energy was to blame for the lack of concentration. 

When asked during the post-match interview whether he had ever experienced something similar during his career, he said that he might have 'in [his] junior days'.

'Sometimes these things happen, you get carried away by the moment,' he said.

'In a semi final in a full stadium where there's a lot of tension and emotion, and you're both trying to do your personal best, sometimes you can't keep track of score.'

The Serb will now face Andy Murray on Sunday evening for the men's grand final, which Djokovic said he was looking forward to.

'Andy and I go back to 12 years old, that's when we first met, there's only a week difference in age between us,' Djokovic said.

'We have a very friendly relationship off court, so it will be nice to see each other and be playing another grand slam against each other,' he said.

Murray will know that it could be a very different version of his old rival he will face on Sunday evening. 

Djokovic holds a 15-8 record over Murray and has won seven times out of the last eight, the exception being the famous Wimbledon final of 2013.

Twice he has beaten Murray in the Melbourne final, although it was the 27 year-old Scot who had the more impressive passage through the last four. 

American powerhouse Serena Williams also appeared to be under the weather,  retiring from practice on Friday afternoon after only ten minutes of play.

Ahead of her Australian open final against Russia's Maria Sharapova, Williams was hunched over in pain after a rigorous start to her workout.

Williams has been plagued by health problems over the past year, appearing to be under the weather in interviews leading up to her semi-final match, and said that she was afraid she had caught a virus. 

Williams, 33, was comforted on court at Melbourne Park by her coach and boyfriend Patrick Mouratoglou, who has been assisting the world number one since 2012.

'I've felt better, but I'm feeling OK. I'm just happy to still be in the tournament', said Williams.
