The model who was left terribly injured after accidentally walking into the propeller of a prop plane showed that she bucks the stereotype of her profession and shrugged her facial injuries off as ‘not that bad’.

Lauren Scruggs, 23, lost her left hand, may lose her left eye, and suffered major injuries to her shoulder, face, hand head.

All of that was not enough to dampen her spirits as her parents reported Thursday that she had taken 30 steps and seen her reflection without flinching.

Not all looks: Lauren Scruggs is a part time model, but she seemed undeterred when she learned that she suffered major injuries to her face during the plane accident

‘She’s got her spunk back, her personality,’ Lauren’s father Jeff Scruggs told The Today Show Friday.

He said that she took a mirror and held it up to her face, shrugging it off, saying: ‘It’s not that bad’.

‘She’s excelling in the physical and occupational therapies and they're not as concerned about. It’s more of a concern about the cognitive and neurological therapies that she’s going to need after this,’ he continued.

A post on the website Caring Bridge which connects patients to loved ones, Lauren’s page reveals she had managed 30 steps five days after the accident which took place last Saturday night at a private airport in Dallas, Texas.

Amazed: Cheryl Scruggs said that the family was initially confused when Lauren's first word was the number 30, but then realized that she had been counting the number of steps she walked

After a brief walk in the hospital, Lauren uttered the word ‘thirty’ to the astonishment of her family.

‘We're thinking what does that mean? And she said "I walked 30 steps",' her mother Cheryl said.

In spite of the recent signs of 
encouragement, the fashion blogger and model faces a long period of 
recovery as she has already undergone several emergency surgeries on her
face and shoulder.

The online update added: 'The left eye is still non-responsive, the doctors will continue monitoring it for the next few days.

'Please pray [for] Lauren as she begins to learn the extent of her injuries.'

She is believed to have been returning
to the two-seater plane to thank the pilot, who was a close friend, 
when she accidentally walked into the propeller.

Lauren was riding in the private prop 
plane, owned by the pilot, to look at Christmas lights from the sky. 
Now, her parents say that she has no recollection of the incident at 
all.

'I was just able to hold her and… 
that's the toughest part of it all, just seeing her waiting there and 
waiting for the help. All I could do was tell her that I love her.'

Family friend Janee Harrell said: 
'They landed and Lauren was getting off the plane so they could pick up 
another passenger. It was dark... we are thinking that Lauren came back 
to thank the pilot, and didn't see that the propeller was winding down.'

Miss Scruggs, who created her own 
style website LOLO Magazine, graduated from Dallas Baptist University in
2009 and has worked as a stylist on Gossip Girl. She recently 
interviewed Twilight star Kellan Lutz at New York Fashion Week where she
also met fashion muse Chloe Sevigny.

According to RadarOnline, Lynn 
Lunsford, Mid-States Public Affairs Manager with the Federal Aviation 
Administration, said that an integral part of the investigation into 
exactly what happened is why the propeller was still moving when Miss 
Scruggs got off the plane.

'It appears that the pilot left the engine running at idle while she exited the plane to switch places with another passenger. That's one of the aspects of the investigation,' he told RadarOnline.

The pilot has not yet been identified but he is thought to have been a friend of Lauren's and recently purchased the plane.

Ms Scruggs, from the suburban area of Plano in Dallas, was taken to the Parkland Memorial Hospital where her devout Christian family, including her mother Cheryl, father Jeff and twin sister Brittany, gathered at her bedside.
