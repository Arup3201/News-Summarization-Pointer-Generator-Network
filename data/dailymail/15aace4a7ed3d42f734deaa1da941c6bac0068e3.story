Steven Gerrard  is 'desperate to taste' European football with  Liverpool again and watched on with 'envy' as other English sides competed in the Champions League.

It has been a long and tortuous four years since the Anfield side last played in Europe's premier competition but Liverpool's first match at home to Bulgarian champions Ludogorets is now just two weeks away.

'When you watch the Champions League and you're not involved there's a jealousy and envy seeing other players play on the big stage and hearing that Champions League music,' Liverpool captain Gerrard told American network ABC.

'You are competing against the best players in Europe and it is the number one competition in the world to play in.

'It is the trophy every player dreams of winning and because of the experience I have gained over the years I was so desperate to taste it again, even if it was just one more time'.

Gerrard inspired his boyhood club to the prestigious trophy in 2005, with Liverpool beating AC Milan 3-2 in a nail-biting penalty shoot-out following a dramatic comeback after they had trailed 3-0 at half-time.

Manager Brendan Rodgers wants to add to the trophy cabinet this season and Gerrard is confident the Reds can achieve that goal.

He added: 'The rule at Liverpool is quite clear. You try to win every competition you enter. He (Rodgers) has been here for two years and I think he is desperate to get a trophy in the cabinet - that is goal number one.

'It is very important we maintain our place in the Champions League but after the journey we went on last year and the confidence we gained from it I think we are genuine title contenders as we have proved we can mix it with anyone in this league.'
