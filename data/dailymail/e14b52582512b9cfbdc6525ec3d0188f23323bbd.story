Officer Facebook: 34-year-old Mary Ferguson is the Facebook Cop in Menlo Park whose $194,000 salary and benefits are paid for by the tech giant

A wealthy Silicon Valley town has partnered with Facebook to fund a brand new officer on its police force whose job, among other things, is to ensure privileged techie offspring stay 'on the up and up.'

Meet Mary Ferguson, AKA the Facebook Cop, whose position was created through a highly unusual public-private partnership between tony Menlo Park and the social media giant.

Over the next three years, Facebook agreed to pay $600,000 to the town, where the company also happens to be headquartered.

Ferguson, 34, who's paid $194,000 in salary and benefits per year for her services, keeps an eye on the internet behavior of potentially unruly kids by using an online persona that hides her true identity.

Ferguson's primary duties apart from patrolling Facebook include keeping children in school, working with juvenile offenders, and helping large area businesses equip themselves for natural disasters, campus shootings or other violent crimes, reports the Wall Street Journal.

'Mary is a pro-active police officer who enjoys working with kids,' Commander Dave Bertini told NBC Bay Area in March, when the force first accepted the funds. 'Her passion and enthusiasm for truancy abatement will drive the department’s program in a successful direction for the youth of Menlo Park.'

While many residents of the well-off tech town appear happy with the unusual corporate partnerships, some people see a conflict of interest.

Menlo Park Mayor Ray Mueller supports the partnership.

'Facebook
 moved into a part of town that was blighted, that was hurting,' Mueller
 told the WSJ. 'One of the first things we're seeing is this public 
safety net coming down to protect everyone.'

The Menlo Police veteran's new job is to stop student truancy in the well-off town of 32,000 and to patrol online using a fake identity in order to keep area kids on 'the up and up'

Mueller brushed off suggestions that the tech giant is acting solely out of self interest.

'Anyone who has the perception that Facebook is trying to protect themselves really doesn't understand the situation,' he told the WSJ. 'That place is a fortress—they don't need the Menlo Park Police to protect them.'

Some experts have their doubts.

'That raises some potential conflicts that, if I was the chief, I am not sure I'd want to wrestle with,' University of South Carolina criminal justice professor Geoffrey Alpert told the WSJ.

Alpert said he worries about skewed loyalties. 'What do you tell your officers about how to treat people who work at Facebook?' he wondered.

For it's part, Facebook has called the $600,000 donation a no-strings-attached gift.

'We just identified a need in the community,' Facebook spokesperson Genevieve Grdina told the WSJ. 'It's not the "Facebook officer"; it's the officer for the whole community.'

Dilemma? While some fear the unusual private-public partnership creates an ethical dilemma, others say Facebook is simply acting out of good corporate citizenship' (pictured is part of Facebook's sprawling Menlo Park campus)
