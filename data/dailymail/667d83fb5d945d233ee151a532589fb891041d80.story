Oliver Foster-Burnell has won a landmark legal battle against Lloyds Bank 

Banks could face paying out billions of pounds to overdraft customers after a landmark legal battle was settled in favour of a man who was charged £750 for being just £2.67 overdrawn. 

Oliver Foster-Burnell from Taunton, Somerset, went a few pounds over his £500 limit with Lloyds while he was in between jobs in 2008. 

Within weeks, the 28-year-old received a letter saying for that every day since he had been charged £20 by the bank. 

The fees spiralled to £750 before Mr Foster-Burnell was able to find a way out of his financial mess. 

But, after settling his debts, he took his case to county court where a judge ordered the bank to pay back the fees with interest. 

His victory could pave the way for billions to be returned to customers in similar situations if Mr Foster-Burnell is able to convince a High Court Judge that his case could apply to others. 

If successful, banks could face returning as much as £30billion to 12.6million customers, according to a study by The Office of Fair Trading. 

Mr Foster-Burnell recalled the emotional toll of being bombarded with notices telling him he was plunging ever further into debt after losing his job as an emergency care responder. 

After dipping past his overdraft, he was sent a letter two weeks later telling him he'd been charged £20 a day since the transaction.  

'They really didn't listen to me at all when I would call them every day to try and sort it out.

'It is unfair the banking industry is allowed to profit while people suffer financial hardship.

'It was incredibly stressful, I could just see the clock ticking and the debts adding up.'

For the first two months he was charged £165 a month, and then £75 a month until the following March, when he felt forced to employ a debt management company.

Due to the extortionate bills he ended up defaulting on two credit cards - one with Lloyds Bank - incurring further late payment charges of £1,400.

It took two years for him to pay off his debt, and he finally felt able to start tackling the bank early last year.

After facing them in court in June, he received his winning judgement last month. 

His victory is the first known for a customer on the fairness of bank charges since a Supreme Court hearing in 2009.   

He faced them in Taunton County Court in June and received his winning judgement last month - the day he arrived back from his honeymoon with new wife Rachel, 28. 

The 28-year-old from Taunton slipped into debt while in between jobs but was fined a total of around £750 by the bank for going over his £500 limit by just £2.67

Who can claim back bank charges now?

Those in 'financial hardship' can still reclaim their bank charges. 

You are judged to be in hardship if for example, you cannot meet your essential bills, if you suffer a drop in income or if you are living off credit and need to borrow more each month.

Should Oliver be successful in the High Court, millions more could claim.

How do you know what you've paid in charges?

Charges usually apply when you stray over your agreed overdraft limit. 

There can be interest on this money and additional charges for direct debits that are declined or bounced cheques.

You'll be able to find what charges you have paid from your bank statements.

Online banking services can provide statements, or your bank may provide this if you ask. 

Where can they claim?

Those claiming back bank charges must first make their claim to their bank. If unsuccessful, they have the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, which is a free service that can produce a legally-binding decision compelling banks to pay the money back.

How much can they claim?

Banks have been able to level charges of £30 or more when account holders go into the red and, although charging structures have become less harsh since 2009, individuals can still run up charges of many hundreds of pounds.

Successful claimants have a right to get this money.

Deputy District Judge Richard Stockdale said his decision was based on European law which states that companies can not change your contract without an explanation.

He said the bank’s terms and conditions caused a ‘significant imbalance... to the detriment’ of Mr Foster-Burnell and ordered they should pay him back and remove a default on his credit file. 

Following the decision, Mr Foster-Burnell has decided to take the issue to the High Court. 

'I could just take the judgment from the court, but I don’t think the banks should continue doing this to other people.

'I can see the people they are doing this to most - it’s single mums, people struggling, and people who live close to the wire every month.'  

'If successful it will impact 12.6 million people - quite big really considering it started with £2.67.

'The people it could apply to are anyone who the bank has charged at all, they don’t necessary have to be in financial hardship.

'My judgment was based on the fact that if you get a letter from your bank saying your terms and conditions have changed, an EU judgment, which we referred to, said they must be clear about how they have changed, and how they apply.

'My barrister is quite confident we’ll win, and he knows what he is doing.' 

A spokesman for Lloyds Banking Group said: 'We do not discuss individual customer cases and any decision will be specific to its facts.

'However, the legal issues relating to bank charges were dealt with comprehensively and conclusively by the judgment of the Supreme Court.'

Martin Lewis, founder of the Moneysavingexpert website hailed Mr Foster-Burnell a ‘pioneer’.

He said: 'It’s up to the court to decide if such a term can be unfair to all - regardless of whether they’re struggling in financial hardship.

'Potentially, we’re talking billions of pounds.'

Mike Dailly, principal solicitor at the free legal resource, the Govan Law Centre, added his case may be ‘potentially dynamite’ because the argument used ‘provides a new legal route to challenging unfair charges’.

Following a series of cases and trials, a surprise Supreme Court ruling in 2009 ruled it was up to banks to decide whether overdraft charges were fair or unfair. 

The Office of Trading had taken on seven banks and one building society following the complaints of millions that they were being unfairly fined. 

At the time, most cases had been settled out of court with banks avoiding the possibility of having to change their policies. 

Lloyds was one of the banks involved in the dispute. After being bailed out at the height of the financial crisis, the part-tax-payer-owned company said it would treat cases individually and that anyone who was likely to receive money back from overdraft charges would have to be considered to suffer significant financial hardship. 

Thousands of disgruntled customers took their complaints to the Financial Ombudsman, which found many who hadn't been refunded were in financial hardship. 

But the Supreme Court ruled it was in the opinion of the bank to decide whether someone qualified for a refund. 

The Office for Trading said it was disappointed by the outcome.
