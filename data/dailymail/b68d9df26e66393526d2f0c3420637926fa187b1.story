It was only a matter of time before LG officially announced its G Flex curved phone after leaked shots of the device appeared online and the Korean firm unveiled a 6-inch flexible display at the start of the month.

In an official press release, LG has taken the wraps off the 6-inch device which is curved vertically so it moulds more comfortably to a user's face and gives improved voice and sound quality.

However, in an unexpected move, LG also announced the device has a so-called 'self-healing' case made from an elastic coating capable of 'recovering from daily wear-and-tear scratches and nicks.'

Display: Curved 6-inch 1280 x 720 resolution

Operating System: Android Jelly Bean 4.2.2

Size: 160.5 x 81.6 x 7.9 - 8.7mm

Weight: 177g

Camera: 13MP rear-facing, 2.1MP front-facing

Colour: Titan Silver

Memory: 2GB RAM with 32GB storage

Battery: 3,500mAh

Processor: 2.26 GHz Quad-Core Qualcomm  Snapdragon 800

LG did not explain further how the coating 'heals' itself, just adding that the case keeps the G Flex 'looking newer longer.'

The leaked shots that appeared two weeks ago suggested the handset would be curved from top to bottom, and LG claims this design reduces the distance between a user's mouth and the microphone.

It also claims the vertically curved shape increases the sound level by three decibels, compared to flat smartphones.

The design is also said to offer 'a more reassuring grip and fits more comfortably in a back pocket.'

LG released a 55-inch curved TV screen earlier this year, designed to improve the viewing angle of the screen, and the Korean firm claims its new phone offers a similar experience when watching videos and playing games.

The G Flex additionally has a Rear Key button, right, first seen on LG's G2 phone. This button can be used to control volume levels, for example

This rear-control button has been designed so there is less chance of a user accidentally turning off the phone, for example. The button can also be used to control volume levels and other tasks.

LG announced at the start of the month it had finished work on the 6-inch flexible OLED display now seen on the G Flex phone.

It is made from plastic substrates, rather than glass, and this gives it flexibility as well as making it unbreakable.

The phone also has a curved battery, developed by LG's research arm LG Chem. 

Other features include a 13MP rear-facing camera with a timer that uses the Rear Key to show a countdown has started.

The QTheater tool gives users quick access to photos, videos and YouTube from the lock screen.

LG's G Flex phone will be available in Korea from November and costs 1.08 million won (£628). Availability in other countries will be announced 'thereafter.'
