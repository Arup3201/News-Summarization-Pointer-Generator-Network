Six spectacular stately homes are preparing for a tourist invasion after being used as sets for the BBC's upcoming adaptation of Hilary Mantel's best-selling Wolf Hall.

The properties in Somerset, Wiltshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire were scouted as the ideal backgrounds for filming the Henry VIII drama starring Damian Lewis as the king, Claire Foy as Anne Boleyn and Mark Rylance as the king’s advisor Thomas Cromwell.

Wolf Hall, which was released in 2009, charts the story of Cromwell's rise to power in the court of the notorious monarch and won both The Man Booker Prize and National Book Critics Circle Award.

Now, the National Trust, which looks after the houses - Barrington Court, Lacock Abbey, Chastleton House, Great Chalfield Manor, Montacute House and Horton Court - is expecting an influx of visitors after the six-part series airs on the BBC next month and on PBS in the US.

Stately homes used as sets for the BBC's Wolf Hall adaptation are expected to see a rise in visitor numbers after the series airs next month. Barrington Court, in Somerset, was used to portray York Place, later called Whitehall, where Cromwell's predecessor Cardinal Wolsey lived

Standing in for Greenwich Palace, Henry's main seat London was Montacute House in Somerset and also used to film Anne Boleyn's arrest

Period dramas have previously caused a rise in visitors, including Highclere Castle in Hampshire, which saw an incredible increase in tourists who wanted to visit the location used to depict ITV's Downton Abbey.

Producers have planned to film in Belgium to cut costs, but ended up using UK spots after tax breaks were introduced for filming in the country.

Lacock Abbey in Wiltshire was used for courtyard scenes in two Harry Potter films and will be seen in the series as the exterior of Wolf Hall - the Seymour family seat. 

Barrington Court, in Somerset, stood in for the interior of York Place – later known as Whitehall – where Cardinal Wolsey, Cromwell's mentor and friend, lived before his fall from grace.

Great Chalfield Manor in Wiltshire was used as the interior of Thomas Cromwell's home. The show charts the rise of Cromwell in Henry's court

Montacute House, also in Somerset, was used to portray Greenwich Palace, which is Henry VIII's main London seat and where Anne Boleyn will be shown as she is arrested.  

Its grounds will also provide the backdrop for a jousting tournament. 

And the exterior of Chastleton House in Oxfordshire, depicts Putney, and is used for the programme's opening scene where a young Cromwell is seen viciously attacked by his father.

But the interior is used to show Wolf Hall, where Jane Seymour first attracts the king's attention.

And Great Chalfield Manor, in Wiltshire, will stand in as the inside of Cromwell’s home.

The final National Trust properties to be used, Horton Court, is the only one not open to the public. 

Scenes have also been filmed in Bristol Cathedral, Gloucester Cathedral, Winchester Cathedral as well as Dover Castle in Kent.

Harvey Edgington, head of filming and locations at the National Trust, said the Trust hoped the BBC series would bring a new audience to the carefully preserved properties. He said film-makers had been subject to strict rules to protect the houses, such as using no-drip candles and having conservators on hand to ensure historic artefacts were kept safe.

The candlelit scenes had left the interiors looking 'beautiful', he said, as well as highlighting the reality of life in the Tudor period. 

'It's quite exciting,' he told The Telegraph.

'It's been proven in the past that you get a massive boost in visitor numbers, and we hope people will want to find out more about the real locations and history behind them.'

Lacock Abbey, in Wiltshire, will be seen in the series as the titular Wolf Hall, which is the seat of Jane Seymour's family

The only one of the National Trust filming locations not open to the public is Horton Court in Gloucestershire, which acted as Austin Friars

Barrington Court, near Ilminster in Somerset

The Tudor manor house, which is currently free from collections and furniture, was saved from ruin and restored by the Lyle family in 1920s 

Arthur Lyle chose the manor house as a family home and used it as a place to install his collection of historic oak panelling, personally supervising its installation from 1922. 

Barrington Court was later home to many young evacuees during the Second World War.  

Lacock Abbey, Wiltshire

The Abbey, which is located at the heart of the picturesque Lacock village features its own woodland grounds. The quirky country house amalgamates various architectural styles and is built upon the foundations of a former nunnery. 

Visitors can experience the atmosphere of the medieval rooms and cloister court - which was used for outdoor scenes in two Harry Potter movies - which give a sense of the Abbey's monastic past.

A museum in the village celebrates the achievements of former Lacock resident, William Henry Fox Talbot, who became famous for his contribution to the invention of photography. 

Great Chalfield Manor, near Melksham in Wiltshire

A beautiful medieval manor, it was first built between 1465 and 1480 for clothier Thomas Tropenell. Part of an original moat still survives.

Visitors can enjoy romantic gardens which feature terraces, topiary houses, a gazebo, lily pond, roses and views across the spring-fed fishpond.

The location has been used for filming numerous times, including The Other Boleyn Girl starring Scarlett Johansson and the BBC adaptation of Tess of the D'Ubervilles. 

Chastleton House, near Moreton-in-Marsh, Oxfordshire

This Jacobean country house was built between 1607 and 1612 by a prosperous wool merchant as an impressive statement of his wealth and power.

It was owned by the same increasingly impoverished family until 1991 and the rare gem has remained essentially unchanged for nearly 400 years while the interiors and contents have gradually succumbed to the ravages of time.

And with almost no sense of the 21st century, including no shop or tearoom, visitors can truly feel as it they have stepped into the past.   

Montacute House, Somerset 

A masterpiece of Elizabethan Renaissance architecture and design, Montacute House features towering walls of glass, the glow of ham stone, and is surrounded by beautiful gardens.

Completed in 1601, the visionary and money behind the mansion was Sir Edward Phelips, it was built under the instruction of master mason William Arnold.

The Long Gallery, which houses more than 60 Tudor and Elizabethan portraits on loan from the National Portrait Gallery, is the longest of its kind in England.

Horton Court, near Chipping Sodbury, South Gloucestershire

The 16th century stone building was originally built as a Norman hall in the 12th century, but is now a manor house and a Grade I listed building.

The house was built by William Knight in about 1521 and the building was expanded to add a new well-glazed east facade, but also incorporating much of the original historic hall, leaving Horton Court with a mix of styles and periods.

The National Trust opened the ground floor on Friday and Sunday afternoons during July and August 2011 and are considering how to make it more readily accessible to the public.
