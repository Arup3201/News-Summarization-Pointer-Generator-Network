Dramatic dash cam footage shows the terrifying moment a woman's Toyota pickup violently veers into another woman's car on a California freeway last weekend.

Police are now investigating whether Stephanie Pontarolo, 33, was after rogue highway justice when her truck smashed into 21-year-old dental assistant Kelsey Shakespeare's car on Saturday.

If it does turn out to be a case of road rage, Pontarolo is likely now kicking herself with the one foot she didn't injure after her truck--not Shakespeare's Volkswagen--flipped completely over in the collision.

Renegade highway justice? Dramatic dash cam footage shows the shocking collision between a Toyota pickup and a Volkswagen Jetta on a San Diego freeway last Saturday in what police are now saying could potentially be an act of road rage

In addition to her foot, Pontarolo suffered lacerations on her face and arm while Shakespeare complained of back pain, according to a California Highway Patrol news release.

The driver whose dash cam caught the shocking episode told police that the altercation began when Shakespeare cut off Pontarolo on I-8 in San Diego, reports KTLA.

In the tense seconds that are subsequently caught on camera, the green pickup truck speeds up beside the Jetta before ramming it at a nearly 90 degree angle.

Just before the incident: Some reports have suggested the the incident began when Shakespeare cut off Pontarolo in her truck

Many dangers: A few tense seconds later and the truck is nearly perpendicular to Shakespeare's car as a tanker truck speeds down the freeway behind them

Moments later, both cars have miraculously veered into the highway shoulder and avoided oncoming traffic. But the damage hasn't all been done

Flipping out: In an ironic twist--if she was in fact acting out of rage--it's Pontarolo's truck that flips over in a cloud of dust as Shakespeare's car keeps all four wheels on the ground

Both vehicles swerve across lanes of traffic and onto the shoulder where Pontarolo's truck flips completely over while Shakespeare's car keeps all four tires on the ground.

A tanker truck was just behind the collision in the far right lane and narrowly avoided smashing into the vehicles, notes KTLA.

According to KSWB, CHP at first called the incident an accidental collision. However, if they discover that Pontarolo is at fault and was out for revenge, she could be headed for the courtroom.

'If it is determined through our investigation that there was an intentional act to harm another person, this incident would not be treated as a collision and separate charges would follow,' reads the CHP news release.

If that happens, California Highway Patrol authorities say Pontarolo could face charges as serious attempted murder.

Flipping off: The shocked other drivers must keep moving past the collision, which the dash cam driver claims involved an 'obscene finger gesture'
