Mastermind: Sandeep Singh-Dosanjh spent proceeds on a £1m house and a Rolls Royce

Three VAT fraudsters who cheated the taxpayer out of £39million in just 69 days in the first case of its kind have been jailed for a total of 35 years.

Mastermind Sandeep Singh Dosanjh, 30, splashed the proceeds of his carbon trading VAT scam on a Rolls Royce and a £1million home in upmarket Bayswater, west London.

Dosanjh and his two friends Ranjot Singh Chahal, 35, and Navdeep Singh Gill, 31, made millions running a series of bogus companies importing high-value carbon credits free of VAT into the UK.

EU emission allowances are known as carbon credits and are certificates which can be bought and sold representing the right to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. They were created as part of national and international attempts to reduce greenhouse gases.

The gang exploited UK VAT laws and sold these carbon credits on to legitimate companies, charging VAT which was never paid back to the government.

The bogus importing companies were then dissolved and the credits were sold on again 
between three further 'buffer' companies – also run by the gang – before
 finally being sold on to legitimate companies so the trading chain 
appeared legal.

The VAT charged by the 'missing trader' was then shared 
out between the gang.

The trades were made in a matter of minutes via a computer system, and 
the stolen VAT was transferred to offshore bank accounts in the United 
Arab Emirates to ‘clean’ the stolen cash which the gang then spent.

Dosanjh, of Kensington, west London, was jailed for 15 years while Gill, of Slough, Berkshire, was sentenced to 11 years and Chahal, of Southall, Middlesex, was locked up for nine years at Southwark Crown Court.

All three were convicted of conspiring to cheat the public revenue between September 
2008 and July 2009 after a 14 week trial which ended last week.

They were arrested in dawn raids in August 2009.

Guilty: Ranjot 
Singh Chahal, right, and Navdeep Singh Gill, left, took part in the carbon trading scam which has now sparked a change in the law

The law has now been changed to prevent carbon credit VAT fraud as a direct result of this case.

Judge Peter Testar said of Dosanjh: ‘He made a significant profit, enough to buy a £1million house in Gloucester Terrace (Bayswater), and he also made enough to trade in his Bentley to buy a Rolls Royce.

‘The total loss to the public purse was £39million or 41million euros, that was the amount that was lost or stolen.

‘During the 69 days of the trading there was a huge sums of money involved.

‘The total turnover was of 276million euros, of which 41million euros was due in VAT.

‘One invoice alone returned to your company was for 8 million euros. That is more than most people would dream of earning in a lifetime.

‘Dosanjh wanted to be perceived as successful, and had the profile of a respectable businessman, but did allow the mask the slip.

‘The point of having buffer companies acts as a protection, but that protection disappears in these different organisations all know each other.

‘Because of the huge amounts of money that was made some deterrent sentences are required.’

Prosecutor Michael Parroy QC described the fraud as a ‘blatant and dishonest cheat on the public purse by a group of people in an organised and systematic fraud on the VAT system’.

He said: ‘The prosecution focuses on the activities of these people while they were trading in carbon credits and using UK regulated companies to do so.

‘The system they employed was simple in its basic concept, but the consequences for them and for the public purse were dramatic.

‘The loss of tax revenue ran into millions and millions of pounds and those involved made a lot of money - some of them made staggering amounts - and all of it was made cheating the tax payers of this country so that money that money that should have paid for hospital and schools was diverted into the pockets of a group of dishonest people.’

Chris Martin, HMRC Criminal 
Investigations, said: 'This was a deliberate attempt to steal as much 
money as possible from the public purse by a criminal gang interested 
only in lining their own pockets.

'HMRC will not stand by and let 
crooks rip off honest taxpayers. The message is clear – if you attempt 
to defraud the Exchequer, we will track you down and bring you to 
court.'

HMRC said confiscation proceedings were underway to ensure that the criminals do not profit from their crimes.
