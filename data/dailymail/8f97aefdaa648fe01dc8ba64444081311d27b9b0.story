One Missouri dad was shocked to receive a letter from his daughter's substitute teacher telling him he had packed her a lunch that was too unhealthy.

The girl's father Justin Puckett, who is a family doctor, posted the letter, written on orange paper to his Facebook, outraged at the 'Big Brother' approach from the Kirksville Primary School teacher.

Annoyed at the implication he and his wife Kylene were not up to the task of caring for their own daughter, Dr. Puckett refused to sign the letter acknowledging he accepted the lunch was not up to scratch.

Request declined: Dr. and Mrs Puckett were annoyed to get this letter from the substitute teacher at Kirksville Primary School on Tuesday

Dr. and Mrs Puckett were shocked to receive the letter on Tuesday evening when their daughter, Alia, returned home from school.

It read: ''Dr. and Mrs. Puckett, The cafeteria reported to me that Alia's lunch today included four chocolate bars, a bag of marshmallows, Ritz crackers and a pickle. Please see that she packs a proper lunch tomorrow.'

The letter then ends with a curt demand - 'Parent signature requested'. The Pucketts wrote back, 'Request declined'.

What annoyed Dr. Puckett most about the letter was the judgmental tone it struck, leaving him in no doubt his parenting skills were under question.

Ordinary parents: Dr. Justin Puckett and Kylene Puckett were handed the letter to them by their daughter Alia and asked to acknowledge the receipt of the note with their signature. They refused

'Unfortunately, the letter didn't have what she had, correctly. She had four pieces of ham, a whole protein meat, she also had some pickles, which we admittedly cheat on pickles every once and awhile as a vegetable, because some fights just aren't worth having,' said Dr. Puckett.

'She also had four marshmallows in a Ziploc bag and then she had three very small pieces of chocolate, of which she ate one for lunch and then she also gave her brother and another friend one at an after school program,' Puckett said to ABC 3.

While Dr. Puckett was contacted by the school principal, Tricia Reger on Wednesday and apologized to, he still feels mildly slighted.

'The issue isn't what happened at the Primary School and with my daughter because she is very independent and going to be completely unaffected by this. But what does bother me is that it just seems that we are constantly being inundated with the inability to be parents of our children,' Puckett added according to ABC 3.

Apologetic: Principal Tricia Reger phoned Dr. Puckett on Wednesday afternoon to say sorry for the substitute's 'overreach' for demanding the Puckett's pack their daughter a healthier lunch

Puckett told ABC 3 that as the Medical Director of the Complete Family Medicine clinic in Kirksville, he is very aware of what constitutes a healthy lunch.

'I'm responsible for them and for the choices that they make and do whether it's at school or not.

'I have the ultimate responsibility to raise my children and I take that role very, very seriously and so maybe I took it bit more personally that there was some offense that maybe I wasn't doing a good job in that duty, something that is my number one job,' Puckett said to ABC 3.

He also said that he accepted the school's apology and that of Kirksville Schools Superintendent Dr. Damon Kizzire, who also released a statement.

'We have as educators been directed to provide healthy and nutritious foods for so long that we had an individual take it upon themselves to send a note home to parents. This will not happen again and I am sorry for any inconvenience.'
