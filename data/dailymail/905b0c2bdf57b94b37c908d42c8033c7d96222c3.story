A celebrity porn website owner has blocked access to hacked naked pictures of leading celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton after his sleazy website was exposed.

The Russian - who ran the site from his home in industrial Samara - admitted: 'I am not thinking about further promoting of this website.'

Sergei Kholodkovskii's lucrative exploitation of hacked pictures was highlighted by MailOnline but since then he has stopped updating the site with new images, and appears to be blocking access to images of women who have complained about their private pictures being used.

Sergei Kholodkovskii's lucrative exploitation of hacked pictures was highlighted by MailOnline. His pole-dancing wife Yana (right), 25, said the pictures were all taken 'from open sources' 

Lucrative pop-up advertising also no longer seems to be part of the site.

Images of Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, Rita Ora and a number of other women appear to be blocked, while others for Kim Kardashian, Kelly Brook, and Scarlett Johansson remain on the site, though no new pictures have been posted for almost two weeks.

Drag racer Kholodkovskii, 28, was tracked down to Samara in southern Russia. He used a website registered in Arizona to post indecent pictures of the stars.

Actresses and models were outraged after intimate photos of them emerged online at the end of August, when they were shared by users of the anonymous photo-sharing site 4chan.

The images had been uploaded to iCloud, an online storage system available to all Apple users which synchronises with iPhones and iPads.

It is thought many of the victims would have had their photos uploaded automatically without realising they had allowed the process to happen through their devices' security settings.

Users' iCloud accounts are private, but hackers found a vulnerability in one of the site's login pages which allowed them to enter multiple passwords until they cracked users' details.

Apple quickly fixed the glitch, but by then the damage had been done. 

Today it emerged 100,000 more videos and images have been leaked online after they were intercepted from Snapchat (above).

The pictures are feared to contain a large cache of child pornography, as half of the app's users are aged between 13 and 17.

Images sent using the app are designed to disappear after they have been viewed once, but recipients can take screenshots of the pictures and forward them to other people. 

He strongly denies that he was responsible for the hacking, as did his pole-dancing wife Yana, 25, who said the pictures were all taken 'from open sources'.

She admitted on her social network that her husband's exposure had been salutary after the story about the website, featuring naked pictures of stars, was taken up by by the Moscow media.

'In Russia this story was broadcast on all the channels and all the media wrote about it. In one day our life turned to something like hell,' she complained, not mentioning the angst for celebrities whose private pictures were featured by her husband without their permission.

But she admitted the couple may avoid travelling to the West where her husband could be at risk of prosecution.

'We should probably only go on holidays to Crimea now,' she said.

Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence, 24, called the publication of pictures 'a sex crime, a sexual violation'.

Kelly Brook, 34, complained of 'a sex crime and a complete invasion of privacy.'

Kholodkovskii initially claimed that the site belonged to a mystery Russian living in Europe but later admitted he collected thousands of hacked images and videos after they were posted on various web sources.

'The first pictures appeared on the internet on August 31 and I decided to make a website and to carry out an experiment if people were interested in such photographs.

'And it turned out they were very much interested. I posted the pictures to the website and it quickly became popular.'

He alleged stars sent him their pictures to be included on his site - which we are not naming.

Asked who volunteered their naked images, he said: ' I do not remember the names of those celebrities.'

He also complained to the Russian media that he had been found by British journalists even though 'all my personal details were closed'.

In fact they were not, since he had openly registered his name as a website owner and registered the address of his mother - who works in a jewellery shop - in Togliatti, a Russian city best known as the home of Lada cars.

He did not appear to give the same privacy concerns to the women whose pictures he uploaded, after they were stolen from Apple's iCloud.

He said his site is now 'living its own life' and he was no longer promoting it. 

Earlier he alleged that many of the stars got 'good publicity' from the exposure.

Speaking out: The actress Jennifer Lawrence said of the leak: 'It's disgusting. The law needs to be changed'
