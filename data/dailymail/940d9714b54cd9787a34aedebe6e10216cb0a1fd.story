A Canyon County man has been arrested after passing himself off as a Disney heir called 'Stephen Disney' and giving away stolen passes to Disneyland.

Stephen David Urquidez, 51, is accused of donating stolen passes to the park to a woman who was hosting a charity auction.

For the winners of the charity raffle it must have been a dream come true, but when they arrived at the theme park they discovered the passes had not been activated and therefore wouldn't work.

False hope: Disneyland passes like these ones were donated to a charity auction, but they had been stolen

Fake identity: Stephen Urquidez allegedly told the charity volunteer his name was Stephen Disney

Authorities believe Urquidez stole the 
passes from a supermarket. He was arrested on 
suspicion of felony burglary on Tuesday.

Urquidez allegedly passed himself off as 'Stephen Disney', when he met a mature student volunteering at a charity.

The 40-year-old woman contacted police in January after discovering that the tickets she was given for the non-profit organization were not valid.

The student, who met Urquidez at college, told police that he claimed to be an heir of the famous family, saying that was why he had the passes, according to KHTS.

Although Urquidez was arrested for burglary and not identity theft, when police arrested him they discovered a driver's license, with a fake state seal, in the name of 'Stephen Disney', and W-2 tax forms showing the Disney name.

Heir claims: Stephen Urquidez allegedly said he was related to the Disney family

Denied: Walt Disney's family say Urquidez has no connection to them or the corporation

Walt Disney Corporation confirmed Urquidez was not affiliated with the corporation or the Disney family.

Police are now keen to hear from other people who may have fallen for the false identity.

In an interview outside his apartment with KCal 9, Urquidez denied using the name, adding: 'Do you think Disney would live here?'

'Somebody lived here before me named 
Disney. They’re confusing me with someone else,' he said. 'I’m 
Stephen Urquidez. I don’t know Stephen Disney.'

Disney regularly gives away tickets for its resorts to charities and non-profit organizations, who must apply online
at least 60 days before the tickets are needed.

Make a wish: Disneyland in Anaheim, California, regularly donates tickets to charitable organizations

Walt Disney was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1901, won 22 Academy Awards in his lifetime.

He founded the $17 million Anaheim resort in California in 1955.

The Orlando Florida resort was still being built at the time of his death in 1966.

After Urquidez posted a $20,000 bond he was released from Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff’s Station.
