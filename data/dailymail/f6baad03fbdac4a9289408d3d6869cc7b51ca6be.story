Likened to 'packing foam' and 'gray IKEA furniture' the McDonald's McRib patty came under scrutiny last year after one was photographed on the production line minus sauce and pickles.

But now the fast food giant is hoping to get people 'lovin" its seasonal treat again by showing exactly how the boneless, preformed morsel is made.

A new behind-the-scenes video takes viewers inside the  Lopez Foods production facility in Oklahoma City where giant chunks of pork are ground down  - no packing foam in sight.

The video is part of a focused marketing campaign that McDonald's recently launched in the U.S.  to shed light on its often-criticized food sourcing and processing methods.

In the film Kevin Nankes, vice president of Lopez Foods, takes Grant Imahara from TV show Mythbusters on a tour of the factory.

Fresh cuts: First up Mr Nankes shows the main ingredient of the McRib - boneless pork picnic shoulders

Coming together: Grinding machines turn the large cuts of pork are into pulp

Recipe: The mince is then mixed with salt, water, dextrose, a type of sugar, and three preservatives: Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), propyl gallate and citric acid

They are joined by Wes Bellamy, a school teacher who vowed never to eat McDonald's again after he saw the photo of the 'disgusting' McRib surface on social media last fall. 

First up Mr Nankes shows the main ingredient of the McRib -  boneless pork picnic shoulders.

Mr Bellamy is seen rummaging around in a trough of shoulders just to ensure no gristly or bony ones are lurking at the bottom.

'This is good,' he says surprised by the quality of the meat.

Next they go to the grinding machines, where the large cuts of pork are turned into pulp.

The mince is then mixed with salt, water, dextrose, a type of sugar, and three preservatives: Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), propyl gallate and citric acid.

Mr Nankes says the preservers are necessary to 'lock in the flavor.'

Final steps: Footage shows preformed McRibs reeling off the production line and being sprayed with a fine mist of water to 'maintain moisture' during the flash freezing process

Mouth-watering? Mr Bellamy admits that the patties look a lot better than the one he saw online

Raw: This photo of frozen McRibs went viral last year - many people deemed the meat blocks 'disgusting' 

He continues: ''After this is mixed we going to form it into the McRib shape... that resembles a rack of ribs.'

Footage shows dozens of preformed McRibs reeling off the production line and being sprayed with a fine mist of water to 'maintain moisture' during the flash freezing process.

Mr Bellamy admits that the patties look a lot better than the one he saw online.

'It's different now that I know what actually goes inside of it and  I know what the process is in terms of making it. It's actually good pork.'

At the end of the video the McRib is put to the test.

The patty is finished off in a barbecue marinade and served in a bun. Pickles and onions are sprinkled on top. 

Changed man: 'It's different now that I know what actually goes inside of it and I know what the process is in terms of making it. It's actually good pork,' Mr Bellamy says

Seconds please! At the end of the video the McRib is put to the test

Mr Imahara and Mr Bellamy, who have never tasted a McRib before, appear to enjoy the 500-calorie sandwich, licking their fingers and putting in a request for seconds.

'The sandwich is actually pretty good. It's actually really good,' Mr Bellamy chimes.

The new push comes as McDonald's fights to boost its performance in the U.S., where sales slid 1.5per cent at established locations in the most recent quarter, following a 0.2per cent dip for last year.

In addition to increased competition, McDonald's is trying to keep up with changing tastes, with places such as Chipotle marketing their food as more wholesome alternatives.

To improve the image of its food, McDonald's recently rolled out chicken wraps with sliced cucumbers and the option to substitute egg whites in breakfast sandwiches.

It also plans to eventually let people swap out the french fries in value meals with options like salad or vegetables.
