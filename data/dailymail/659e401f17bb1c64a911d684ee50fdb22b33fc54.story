A 'happy and outgoing' 12-year-old boy was found hanged at his home minutes after returning from school.  

Kyle Darker was discovered at his house in Eccles, Greater Manchester around 3.30 yesterday afternoon, and was airlifted to hospital.

There are fears he might have been bullied at the school where he started less than a year ago, after friends suggested he had been tormented by other pupils.

Relatives paid tribute to the Year Seven schoolboy, who turned 12 just two weeks ago, describing him as a talented pianist and passionate Manchester United fan whose death has 'left a big hole in our hearts'.

Tragic: 12-year-old Kyle Darker was yesterday found dead at his home in Eccles, Greater Manchester

Officers say they are not treating Kyle's death as suspicious, but the circumstances of the tragedy will be the subject of an investigation. 

After a family member called an ambulance, Kyle was taken by helicopter to Salford Royal Hospital, but doctors were unable to save his life.

The road where he lived with his mother Lorraine and stepfather Kevin was yesterday cordoned off by police as they gathered evidence. 

A Facebook tribute page set up in Kyle's memory received 1,700 visitors within less than 24 hours of his death.  

His aunt, Margaret Tunnacliffe, said: 'Tonight we lost our very happy, outgoing, funny little boy. Your loss has left another big hole in our hearts. We are going to miss you terribly sweetheart.'  

Home: Police and ambulance services were called to Kyle's family home around 3.30pm yesterday

Friends: A group of schoolchildren arriving at Kyle's home to leave flowers in his memory

His cousin Paige added: 'RIP my beautiful cousin, I love you millions. I can't believe you're gone, you were always so happy and bouncy.  

'You will never be forgotten. Always in our hearts forever and always. Sweet dreams.'

Family friend Jean Wilde said: 'This is just so very sad and so very wrong. It's heart-breaking that this little boy did not get the help and support. 

'What a lovely little boy, my heart goes out to his parents and I fear for other boys like him that fall prey to bullying.  

'God bless and may you RIP Kyle, my prayers and thoughts are with you and your family.' 

Grief: Friends and family said that the schoolboy's death would 'leave a big hole in our hearts'

Jess Davis,
 a friend of Kyle's, wrote on social media: 'Hate bullies so much. RIP 
Kyle sleep tight little man, had your whole life ahead of you.'  

Another friend added: 'RIP Kyle how you can bully somebody so much that they 
feel they need to end their life? It's disgusting. Knocks me sick.' 

St
 Patrick's Roman Catholic High School, where Kyle started last 
September, refused to comment on whether or not he had been bullied.

Neighbour Pete Williams said: 'He was a lively young lad who had so much in front of him. He had so much talent.  

'I am a record producer and he would come to mine and play the piano. I will miss him so much. He was fabulous.' 

Mourners: Friends were pictured arriving at the home of Kyle's family with flowers in his memory

Upset: Friends and relatives described Kyle as a talented piano player and passionate Manchester United fan

A spokesman for St Patrick's said: 'It is shocking and a lot of people will be affected by this.

'The thoughts and prayers of all staff members and the school are with the family and friends of Kyle.'  

A report into Kyle's death is being prepared for the coroner ahead of an inquest to be held at a future date.  

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'Police were called to an address on Boardman Street at around 3.30pm.  

'Officers arrived after responding to a call from ambulance services and discovered the body of a 12-year-old boy.  

'There are no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death.'
