Cashing in: Insurance tycoon Peter Wood (pictured) is set to pocket £175m from the £1bn flotation of his online venture Esure

The insurance tycoon who founded Direct Line and Sheilas' Wheels is set to pocket £175m from the flotation of his massively successful online venture Esure, it emerged today.

Peter Wood, who is chairman of the company and owns 90 per cent alongside private equity backer Tosca Penta, will dispose of only part of his shareholding in the London market's biggest float so far this year.

Stock in the initial public offering will be priced at between 240p and 310p, giving it a mid-point valuation of £1.15billion and enough for a place in the FTSE 250 Index.

Mr Wood, who will remain Esure's largest shareholder, said today: 'We have worked hard for many years to make Esure a business that can compete at the highest level with confidence.'

Mr Wood established Esure in 1999, after massive success with Direct Line, and also later founded women-focused car insurer Sheilas' Wheels as well as taking a 50 per cent stake in comparison website GoCompare.

The 65-year-old entrepreneur's wealth was estimated at £500m by 2011's Sunday Times Rich List.

In December, he vowed to keep all his wealth in Britain and to pay his full tax here when Esure floated.

His comments came after it was reported some months earlier that he was looking at the possibility of moving his domicile to the Channel Islands as a means of easing his tax burden.

But with the increasing disclosures of widespread tax avoidance by businesses operating in Britain, Wood made it clear he and his family want to lead by example by making their full contribution to the Exchequer.

Wood is one of the few British financiers to emerge from the great financial panic with his business empire enhanced.

When his partners Lloyds-HBOS ran into difficulty in the autumn of 2008, he moved quickly to rescue Esure from the wreckage using his personal wealth to buy back his shares in the group.

‘I am a British resident and intend to stay in the UK,’ Wood said in December.

As a father of five daughters, Peter Wood did not need convincing that women are the safer drivers.

Esure broke new ground in the British insurance market in 2005 by reaching out to women through the Sheilas’ Wheels brand, characterised by its three pink sequin-clad Sheilas (above) from Australia.

The company has enjoyed phenomenal success in large due to the lower degree of risk.

And as 95 per cent of policyholders are female, this has also minimised the price disruption caused by the recent introduction of a new gender-neutral pricing regime across the industry.

He was also sharply critical of U.S. 
firms such as eBay and Google that make huge profits in UK and compete 
with his online insurance site GoCompare.com but avoid UK tax.

He urged the Government to create a ‘level playing field for online businesses’ in the UK. Wood is among the most successful figures in the global insurance industry.

In an earlier life at Royal Bank of Scotland, he built Direct Line in 1985, which at its peak earnings power was estimated to be worth £10billion.

He had done much the same in the US, where he has been a key figure at insurer Plymouth Rock.

As someone who spends a considerable part of his business life in the US – in Boston and also has a home in Florida – Wood had no shortage of routes to avoid the net of British taxation.

Following the IPO, Wood intends to remain chairman as well as being the largest shareholder.

He is committing, however, that any chairman’s fees go directly into a charitable trust and he will be paying the full whack of income tax on any dividends that he receives in the future.

Confidence in IPOs has been lifted by
the successful listing of housebuilder Crest Nicholson, which was 
priced at 220p or £550million on February 13 and is now trading at 280p.

The
Esure business, which was made famous by the late Michael Winner's 
'Calm down, dear' television ads, was created out of a joint venture 
with the Halifax before Lloyds Banking Group sold its 70 per cent stake 
in 2010.

Wealthy: Mr Wood (seen here with Bob Dench, managing director of Barclays Insurance) has a estimated fortune of £500m according to 2011's Sunday Times Rich List

There were 
1.25million in-force motor policies and 500,000 home policies at the end
of 2012, helping the Surrey-based company to more than double pre-tax 
profits to £115.5million last year.

The
company's conservative approach to underwriting means 87 per cent of 
its motor policy holders are over 30 years of age, while 98 per cent of 
in-force home policies are located in areas considered to have low risk 
of flooding.

And as 95 
per cent of Sheilas' Wheels policyholders are female, this has minimised
the price disruption caused by the recent introduction of a new 
gender-neutral pricing regime across the industry.

The IPO, which will place between 35 
per cent and 50 per cent of shares in public hands, will raise 
£50million towards paying down debt.
