A handyman who won a $32 million jackpot lottery with his barber is being sued by his sister who says she is entitled to a third of the winnings.

Leila Nahas claims she paid her brother Samir Haddad $1 toward the $3 winning ticket and deserves $10.6 million, plus $500,000 in damages.

But Haddad said he doesn't owe her a dime, because 'they never had an agreement'.

Lottery winner Samir Haddad is being sued by his sister Leila Nahas who claims she deserves one-third of the $32 million jackpot winnings because she contributed $1 to the $3 ticket in 2008

Sun News Network reported Haddad and his longtime friend and barber Mike Dettorre hit the jackpot with a Lotto 6/49 ticket in June 2008 in Canada.

Dettorre had cut Haddad's hair for more than 30 years at the barber's Old Ottawa South shop.

Haddad, a self-employed floor installer and handyman, reckons he's bought 'thousands' of lottery tickets over the years.

The men split the winnings, and 35 of Haddad's family - including his sister - traveled to the Ontario Lottery and Gaming office in Toronto in a limousine to collect the money.

He split some of his winnings with his family and sister.

But now Nahas claims Haddad visited her store before the June 2008 Lotto draw to buy a ticket.

She said they'd agreed to split one and that she’d contribute to another ticket he planned to buy with Dettorre.

Nahas alleges he showed her an old ticket with numbers he’d played with the barber, she wrote them on a slip of paper and they settled up.

According to her statement of claim filed in January 2010, Nahas trusted her brother would tell her if he’d won with the shared ticket, but two months later, the paper fell from her wallet as she shopped and she 'realized that she was owed one-third of the proceeds from the winning ticket.'

She claims her brother admitted it was the ticket he’d bought with her, but said it was unfair for her to share the winnings because she’d only contributed $1 and he’d bought thousands of tickets for years, according to Ottawa Citizen.

However Haddad vigorously denies all of his sister's allegations, including that he told her she was 'dead to him'.

He said he went to the barber shop on the day of the draw, got the old ticket then went to the store around the corner to buy a new one with the same numbers.

He put it on Dettorre’s mirror and learned from him two days later that they’d won.

The siblings haven't spoken in several years.

Dettorre is reportedly not part of the legal fight, but he could lose some of his winnings if the court upholds Nahas' claim.

The bitter battle will land in front of a judge and jury on Tuesday.
