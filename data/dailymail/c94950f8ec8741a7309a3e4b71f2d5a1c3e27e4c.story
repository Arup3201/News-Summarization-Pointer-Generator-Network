For almost a year and a half workers had been constructing a bridge to cross the main Interstate that runs between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, but it took just minutes to bring the entire structure crashing to the ground.

The blaze began after a construction workers' blowtorch was fanned by strong winds and ignited the wooden scaffolding that was being used to build the new flyover, across Interstate 15 in Herperia, California.

Driven by high winds, the fire took hold extremely quickly and began burning the supports surrounding the bridge.

Debris began to fell onto the I-15 minutes after the fire began, the road was eventually closed to traffic at 1:30pm yesterday as the $32 million construction project slowly turned into a pile of ash and twisted metal.

Burn bridges: A fire at a bridge construction site on Interstate 15 in Herperia, California continued to smolder Tuesday morning

Road to hell? The blaze, which burned through the night, reduced the bridge's wooden support structure to ash and caused steel girders to sag into the freeway below

Smouldering remains: A section of the 15 Freeway in Hesperia remained closed in both directions on Tuesday, the day after a fire destroyed an overpass that had been under construction

Firefighters try to contain a fire at a bridge construction site on Interstate 15. The blaze, which burned through the night, reduced the bridge's wooden support structure to ash and caused steel girders to sag into the freeway below

Closed: The construction at Interstate 15 was engulfed in flames on Monday. The bridge at Ranchero Road caught fire at about 1:30 p.m. and Interstate 15 was closed soon after because of falling debris

Crews used heavy equipment to slowly drag collapsed remnants out of lanes

Traffic on the northbound side of Southern California's main connector to Las Vegas could be flowing again by mid-to-late afternoon on Tuesday

It all happened so fast that some 
builders continued to remain on site, completely unaware that flames 
were licking at the structure just feet away from them.

Incredibly, nobody was hurt during the dramatic collapse although one worker was taken to hospital after suffering from the effects of breathing in smoke.

The road is expected to remain closed in both 
directions until this evenings' commute at the earliest however officials are hopeful that all lanes will be open by Wednesday morning.

In the meantime, officials have told drivers to stay away from from the Cajon Pass.

On Monday evening, enormous traffic jams built up including with traffic backing up 6 miles to the south and up to 20 miles to the north.  

Up in smoke: More than a years worth of construction effort went up in flames as the bridge collapsed

Demolished: The fire spread across the bridge which was as big as a football field

Overnight: Firefighters spent much of the night dampening down the flames

Commuters were urged to find alternate routes. Southbound lanes are expected to reopen by Wednesday morning

Dozens of firefighters battled the blaze in windy conditions, with limited access to water, and high danger that the wooden skeleton of the football-field-sized bridge would collapse

Dozens of firefighters battled the blaze in windy conditions, with limited access to water, and high danger that the wooden skeleton of the football-field-sized bridge would collapse on top of them.

By Monday night most flames were out aside from some smoldering, however firefighters remained on the scene throughout the night.

Caltrans crews worked into the evening demolishing remnants of the wooden skeleton of the bridge, which had been under construction since early 2013.

Cause: A construction worker's torch was picked up by the high winds in the area and set the bridge on fire. The daylong firefight was tough because flames were in areas that were hard to get to under the bridge and there was danger of a collapse

Now look what you've done! The blaze was started when a construction worker's blowtorch accidentally ignited the wooden supports of the Ranchero Road overpass bridge

When the fire erupted, Caltrans contractors were still working on top of the bridge and unaware of the blaze until being evacuated by firefighters because the flames were being pushed away by the wind

Traffic on the northbound side of 
Southern California's main connector to Las Vegas could be flowing again
 by mid-to-late afternoon, said Basem Muallem, District 8 Director for 
Caltrans. Southbound lanes are expected to reopen by Wednesday morning, he said.

When the fire erupted, a number of Caltrans contractors were still working on top of the bridge and unaware of the blaze until they were told to evacuate by firefighters as the flames were being pushed away by the wind.

'The Cajon Pass is going to be a nightmare for the next 24 to 48 hours at least,' Wilkins said. 'So if at all possible, avoid it altogether, because there is just no way they're going to open it any time soon.'

It's recommended that drivers use alternate routes including interstates 138 and 18.

Ruined: Debris from the Ranchero Bridge project remains draped over the Interstate 15. This bridge was just one part of a 59 million dollar project to improve transportation in the area

Clearing the clutter: A contractor cuts steel re-bar as the remains of the Ranchero overcrossing bridge is torn down. Southbound lanes are expected to reopen by Wednesday morning

One worker suffered smoke inhalation after not realizing the bridge was alight!

Going nowhere fast: California Highway Patrol diverts traffic off of Interstate 15. A traffic jam up to 20 miles long was created as a result of the incident

Traffic jam: Motorists drive along the emergency lane as traffic on Interstate 15 came to a stop just south the Ranchero Interchange Bridge as it burned on Monday
