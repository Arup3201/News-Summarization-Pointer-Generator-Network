Cancelled: Dapper sport star Wiggins has ended his 'minor' investment in the scheme

Olympic gold medallist and Tour de France cycling hero Bradley Wiggins announced today that he has ended his involvement with a controversial tax-avoidance scheme.

Critics rounded on the 32-year-old after The Mail On Sunday reported last week he was using a scheme named Twofold First Services, owned by a company based in the Cayman Islands.

Wiggins stated 'I had a small investment in Twofold, following guidance from my professional advisers'.

'I had, however, claimed no tax relief of any amount in regard to this investment. Given the concerns raised about it, I have now instructed my advisers to withdraw me from the scheme with immediate effect.'

A spokesman for Wiggins said at the time: ‘The vast majority of Bradley’s income is taxed at the standard and higher rate. The investment in Twofold Services involves only a small percentage of Bradley’s income. Bradley has paid, and will continue to pay, his fair share of tax.’

In an interview with The Guardian Wiggins went on to describe his frustration at the revelations of Lance Armstrong’s organised doping.

He said: 'The anger is more: I’ve got to pick up the pieces. He’s still a multi-millionaire, and he’s not here to answer the questions. I can’t not answer them because I’ve got to go and race next year, and I hate talking about it.'

The cyclist, who is hot favourite for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award, said there was a price to pay for his success.

He said: 'I wouldn’t say I wish I hadn’t won the Tour, but sometimes, especially with recent events, the Lance Armstrong stuff, I find it hard being the winner of the Tour and everything that goes with it.'

'I wanted to be the winner for the 
challenge of what the sporting event is about and how hard you can train
to do that, and I never wanted all the stuff that went with it.'

He also revealed that he finds it difficult to cope with being recognised by fans when he is out with his family.

He said: 'They ask your wife to take the photo, which is a bit rude. And after a while that becomes tiresome, especially when you’re having a pizza with your children, or you have to have a photo with somebody else’s kids while yours stand to the side.'

'There comes a point when I’ve got to start getting on with my life. It would be hard to live my life as it is forever.'

In a Twofold-type scheme, an individual 
could end up paying no tax at all, by investing around £100,000 yet 
claiming tax relief on £1 million.

This is achieved as each £100,000 is supplemented by a £900,000 loan taken out by the partnership. That money, after being paid to the farmer, is swiftly repaid to the bank.

The accountants find a way to artificially ‘write down’ the investment to become a loss on paper, even though there was no cash loss.

The original £100,000 goes to the advisers and banks in fees, but the partnership members claim they have made a loss of £1 million, which they set against their income.
