A 17-year-old gang-rape survivor's insistence on justice has led a blackballing by her community and, it is alleged, her mother's murder.

The girl from Karnal in the Indian state of Haryana, who cannot be named, has been shunned by neighbours since accusing two men of a higher caste of raping her.

Even in a country racked with guilt over violence towards women, she and her father claim they have faced official indifference - and even obstruction - to their efforts to see the suspects sent to jail.

Ostracised for seeking justice: The girl from Karnal in the Indian state of Haryana, who cannot be named, has been shunned by neighbours since accusing two men of a higher caste of raping her

The victim was 16 when she was snatched from the street as she walked to school and raped by two men in a moving car.

She reported the attack to the police but three weeks later, on a date etched on to the wall of her home, her mother disappeared.

Two days later she was found dead in canal. Doctors said she too was raped before she was murdered.

Now the teenager's fight to see the men accused of her rape sent to jail has pitted her and her family against a hostile neighbourhood.

They are Dalits, India's lowest caste who are derided as 'untouchables'; the suspects, who police say also raped and killed her mother, are upper caste.

Haryana is at the front line of India's rape epidemic. At one point last year, two women were raped every single day in the state, which has a population of 25.3million.

But despite a high-profile national political drive for greater safety for women and girls on India's streets, rape convictions remain difficult to secure - a situation worsened by the politics of the country's caste system.

'We didn't compromise, that's why everyone is 
angry with us': The victim's widowed father, a day labourer, said 
neighbours had repeatedly told them to drop the charges against the suspects, who are from the upper caste

The victim's widowed father, a day labourer, said neighbours had repeatedly told them to drop the charges.

'We didn't compromise, that's why everyone is angry with us. We want the culprits to get the life sentence. Only then our struggle will be justified,' he said.

The government gave him four lakh (Â£4,668) compensation for his wife's murder and the rape of his daughter last year. That money has now all been spent on lawyers for the case which still drags on in a 'fast-track' court.

To compound matters, he believes that a police officer related to one of the accused tampered with evidence that is crucial to the prosecution.

The young victim now hopes to find salvation through education - although she struggles to afford school books

For his daughter, her insistence at speaking out has had terrible consequences.

'No one speaks to me,' she told Indian news network NDTV. 'I don't talk to them. Or visit anyone. I just stay at home. What is the point?

'Nobody talks nicely to me. Even my uncle bad-mouths me. It would be better to just leave this village.'

She now hopes to find salvation through education. 'Though I am at home, I can do better than those girls who are attending school. I can still get better marks than my classmates,' she said.

'But I don't have money to buy books.'
