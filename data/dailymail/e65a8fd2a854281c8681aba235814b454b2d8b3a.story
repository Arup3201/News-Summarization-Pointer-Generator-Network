Lovingly stroking and snuggling your cat should be a comforting treat.

But now pet owners have been warned that cuddling their feline can cause them stress.

Research has revealed that more than half of people do not know how to cope with an anxious cat and think that petting them is the answer.

Pet owners have been warned that stroking their pet cats could be causing more stress than relaxing them

Leading cat charity, Cats Protection, asked pet owners what they knew about caring for their moggy but found too many were letting the love of their pets cloud their judgement.

Nicky Trevorrow, Cats Protection’s behaviour manager, said: ‘Being held or stroked for too long can be very stressful for some cats.

‘Space and peace is often what they need - they’re not small furry humans so what would comfort us won’t necessarily comfort them.

‘Owners love their animals and want them to be happy but our research has highlighted a lack of understanding of stress triggers for cats and how to deal with them.’

The charity also found that 55 per cent did not realise that living with another cat or dog can cause stress and 51 per cent failed to recognise wetting and soiling in the house as a sign of stress.

Only a quarter knew that grooming a particular area all the time was an indication that their pet was suffering anxiety.

And half were unaware that strange cats coming into the house also had an effect. 

It carried out the research for a BBC2 Horizon documentary, Cat Watch 2014, which follows the secret lives of 100 cats.

The animals were tracked using GPS and micro-cameras and examined in three different environments.

The series reveals the secret language of cats and why they meow, how they transformed from pampered pet to predator and how they see, hear and smell the world with the sense of their wild ancestors.

It will be aired on Tuesday, October 7. 

1. Try not to overly stroke or cuddle a cat which is showing signs of stress as it can make it worse.

2. Always provide your cats with easily accessible places to hide and let them stay in there for as long as they want to. A hiding place makes them feel safe and secure and can be something as simple as a cardboard box on its side or upside down. Or you could buy an igloo-style cat bed.

3. Cats feel safer if they can view their surroundings from up high, so make sure they can access somewhere like the top of the wardrobe or a high shelf.

4. Make sure there is enough food, water and litter trays for the all of the cats in the household. The ideal number of litter trays is one per cat plus one extra.

5. Install a microchip or magnetic cat flap, which lets your cats into your property and keeps neighbouring cats out.
