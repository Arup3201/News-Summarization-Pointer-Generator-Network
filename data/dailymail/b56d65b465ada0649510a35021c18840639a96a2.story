One father and daughter have found a very unique way of going into business with one another.

Jeffrey and Meika Hollender, the founders of Sustain, are currently marketing and selling the first 'sustainable Fair Trade brand of condoms.'

And to think some girls find it difficult to even talk about the birds and the bees with their father.

Daddy's little girl: Meika Hollender (above) started a line of sustainable condoms with her father, called Sustain

Proud papa: 'The fact that Meika and I work together selling a product that has to do with sex is really a model for the kind of openness we should have in our society,' says Jeffrey

'The fact that Meika and I work together selling a product that has to do with sex is really a model for the kind of openness we should have in our society,' Jeffrey tells the Daily News.

His daughter seems to feel the same, adding, 'When an uncomfortable moment comes up, I laugh it off — it might end up in my next blog post.'

The line uses latex taken from a sustainable rubber plantation in India that bans child labor and is environmentally sound. 

What's more, that plantation provides 180 workers a living wage and gives free medical care and education to workers’ families.

'The amazing thing about this incredibly small product is how many benefits it has for our society and the planet,' explains Jeffrey. 

How it works: The condoms are made from latex farmed at an environmentally sound plantation in India 

Marketing: The two admit they do not however discuss condom specifics, just the sustainability of the latex 

Making the father-daughter work relationship somewhat easier is also the fact that condom specifics, like size and reservoir caps and lubrication, are left to the experts to decide upon, not the Hollenders.

'There are certain things that are off limits for discussion,' says Jeffrey. 

'Which I think is appropriate.'
