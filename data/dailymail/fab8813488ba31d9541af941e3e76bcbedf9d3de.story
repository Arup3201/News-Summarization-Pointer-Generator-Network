The Reserve Bank is working with other regulators to crack down on risky lending to housing investors amid concerns they are intensifying soaring property prices in Sydney and Melbourne.

Australia's central bank is worried that the fast-growing rate at which banks are lending to investors is out of proportion with rental demand.

This could have wider-ranging effects on the economy, the RBA warned in its twice-yearly Financial Stability Review.

Loans to property investors are growing at nearly 10 percent, the fastest pace since 2007, and almost double the rate for owner-occupiers.

And Australian Bureau of Statistics housing finance figures show investors account for more than 40 per cent of new home loans.

'As a result, the composition of housing and mortgage markets is becoming unbalanced, with new lending to investors being out of proportion to rental housing's share of the housing stock,' the RBA wrote.

The RBA questioned whether banks were practicing enough caution in their lending practices considering the current climate of 'low interest rates, strong housing price growth and higher household indebtedness than in past decades.'

House prices rose 16 per cent year-on-year in Sydney in August, and 12 per cent in Melbourne, RP Data figures showed.

To address the risks the RBA said it had been working with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to increase the intensity of its supervision of banks' lending practices.

The Reserve Bank released a draft of new guidelines and said it was considering taking 'further steps' to reinforce responsible lending to investors with APRA and other members of the Council of Financial Regulators.

AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said the decision to regulate lending to investors, known as 'macroprudential policy', hadn't been seen in Australia for about 30 years.

Normally at this point in property cycle the RBA would raise interest rates, but it is reluctant to do so because the economy is 'a bit messy'.

But if the RBA failed to take any action the property market would continue to gather momentum, Mr Oliver said.

'We would end up with full-blown bubble which could burst, which would have devastating effects on the economy,' he said.

'The worry would be that the higher prices grow, the greater the chance you're risking [house price] falls of 20-30 percent, not just 5-10 percent.'

Mr Oliver said high auction clearance rates – particularly in Sydney and Melbourne – were welcomed a year ago but are now causing concern for the RBA.

'They wanted housing to pick up to fill a gap left by mining,' he said.

'The whole point of cutting interest rates was to drive demand to homes, push up house prices and send a signal to home builders to build more homes, because once you get housing going it boosts retail spending as well.'

Mr Oliver said that was achieved a year ago but auction clearance rates were still at record levels.

'Sydney's at record level, Melbourne's pushing up at record levels and that makes them think it's getting too hot and it's become a bit speculative,' he said.

If the RBA failed to take action – either by lifting interest rates or using macroprudential measures – the property market could suffer a 'sharp collapse', Mr Oliver said.

'It's what was happening in the US and Ireland prior to the GFC, and those countries went on to see falls of 30-40 percent,' he said.

'Homeowners see massive losses in wealth, they spend less, people have trouble servicing their mortgages.'

Mr Oliver said macroprudential policy would benefit mortgage holders.

'If the Reserve does go down this path then it takes off some of the pressure to raise interest rates,' he said.

'It could mean a good outcome for those who have a mortgage, because we'll have lower interest rates for even longer.'
