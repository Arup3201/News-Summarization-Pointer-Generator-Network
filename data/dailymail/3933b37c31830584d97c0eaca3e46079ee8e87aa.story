Minnesota police say 19 people have been arrested after crowds filled the streets of the Dinkytown neighborhood following the Gophers' NCAA hockey title game loss.

Union College defeated Minnesota seven to four Saturday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. But crowds spilled into Dinkytown near the University of Minnesota campus after the game.

Police say in a statement that two known incidents of arson were reported, along with an undetermined amount of property damage.

University of Minnesota students were warned Friday that a heavy police presence would be in place during the national hockey championships to prevent a repeat of the riotous behavior that erupted after Minnesota edged out North Dakota in the Frozen Four semifinals.

Thursday night's unrest drew police in riot gear as hundreds of students and other hockey fans took to the streets in Dinkytown near campus to celebrate the Gophers' last-second win. Some fans threw beer bottles and cans at officers, others climbed light poles, and one video showed several young men jumping on top of a squad car. A State Patrol helicopter was called to illuminate the area.

Police arrested several people, and two officers were taken to Hennepin County Medical Center for, Minneapolis police said Friday. An undetermined amount of public and police property was damaged during the two-hour disturbance, police said.

'The actions of a few people in Dinkytown last night unfortunately marred the victory of our Gophers men's hockey team,' University of Minnesota President Eric Kaler wrote in an email sent to students Friday. 'These actions are unacceptable and must not be repeated.'

Kaler said that any similar outbreak of misbehavior Saturday after Minnesota's game against underdog Union in Philadelphia, 'will be met with zero tolerance.'
