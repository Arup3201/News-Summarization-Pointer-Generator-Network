It would appear that Spring has finally sprung with thousands of people across the UK enjoying the sunshine as the Met Office has announced this winter has been the sunniest  in records dating back nearly 90 years.

While Britain has experienced fairly average temperatures and rainfall - unlike last winter which was the wettest on record - 2015 is on track to be the sunniest since 1929.

By February 25, with three days left to go of the meteorological winter, the UK had already seen 189 hours of sunshine, equalling the previous record year in 2001.

The Met Office predicts that with sunshine in the last three days of winter, the UK is likely to beat the record by seven hours.

Unlike last year's wet and stormy winter, the season this year has recorded just 8 per cent more rainfall than the long term average, with 375 mm (14.8in) of rain across the UK, with the southern, eastern and north eastern areas of England drier than usual. 

But in Scotland the winter has been one of the top 10 wettest in records dating back to 1910, the Met Office said.

Despite being so wet and stormy, many areas in winter 2014 also had above average sunshine, the weather experts said, because the storms brought rain in short, sharp bursts, often overnight, leaving plenty of time for sunshine in between.

Three day forecast: The fine weather is not expected to last as cloud is forecast to move in from the West bringing wetter conditions

This year, winter temperatures are expected to be slightly above average, at 3.8C, compared to the long term average of 3.7C.

But it was much less warm than last winter when temperatures averaged 5.2C, beginning what became the UK's hottest year on record.

Early figures for February from the Met Office suggest the month was drier than average and likely to be slightly cooler than average.

But it was notably mild on February 18, with 15.6C, recorded at Fyvie Castle, Aberdeenshire.

In a statement the Met Office said: 'The month showed the variety of winter weather we can get in the UK - the first half of the month being dominated by high pressure, bringing mostly dry and settled and cold weather, while the second half of the month was more unsettled with westerly winds bringing Atlantic frontal systems.'

Crocuses, a traditional harbinger of spring, are blooming on the famous Backs in Cambridge as the UK enjoys a bright and sunny end to February.

Tourists stopped to admire the purple and lilac buds as they made the most of the sunshine to walk along the banks of the River Cam and go punting. 

But the fine weather is not expected to last as cloud is forecast to move in from the West later this afternoon and tomorrow will see a damp and drizzly morning, with patchy rain across the UK.

Saturday will also see more persistent rain move into the West as the day goes on and strong winds.

The Met Office has issued a weather warning for wind in Northern Ireland and central and southern Scotland from 5pm on Saturday to 4am on Sunday, with gusts of up to 70mph expected in exposed areas.

Temperatures will be slightly milder than they have been recently, with highs of 8C in the North and 9C in the South.

The first day of March on Sunday is set to be another windy day across the country, with outbreaks of rain, particularly in the North West. The afternoon is set to be brighter, with slightly cooler temperatures of 6 to 8C.

'Next week will see cold and showery weather on Monday and Tuesday, but should become more settled from Wednesday,' said Helen Roberts, of the Met Office. 'Temperatures may be slightly cooler than average.'
