On trial: Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell smoking a cigarette outside Manchester Crown Court yesterday, which heard he was a drunk and a 'weak man' but not a child rapist

Michael Le Vell might be a weak and stupid alcoholic but he did not rape a girl from the age of six, his lawyers said yesterday.

A trial was told the Coronation Street actor’s drinking problems were being used against him in a ‘prosecution by cliché’.

But Eleanor Laws QC, for the Crown, insisted the soap star had committed the offences  ‘in drink’.

She told the jury to dismiss the idea the 48-year-old was the subject of a witch hunt amid a welter of prosecutions of celebrities. 

And she said the alleged victim had nothing to gain by ‘quite literally destroying the life’ of an innocent man.

‘No one likes to think someone they liked or admired has done anything like this,’ Miss Laws added.

‘These offences are not committed by one obvious type of person. They are committed by individuals who are loved by their friends, who have no idea what is going on.’

Barristers yesterday delivered their final speeches to the jury of eight women and four men at the end of the six-day trial at Manchester Crown Court.

Le Vell, who has played garage mechanic Kevin Webster in the ITV soap for 30 years and is being tried under his real name Michael Turner, denies five counts of rape, three of indecent assault and four relating to sexual activity with a child.

Defence: Barrister Alisdair Williamson told the eight women and four men 'the only right thing to do is not guilty'

Alisdair Williamson, defending, told 
the jury Le Vell should not be found guilty just because he was ‘weak, 
inadequate and a drunk’.

‘This
 has been prosecution by cliché,’ he added. ‘Mr Turner drinks a lot, he 
has his demons. What’s that supposed to mean? He has troubles. What’s 
that supposed to mean? That’s all the Crown can come up with for a 
motive.’

He said the 
evidence put forward by the girl was ‘inconsistent’ and lacked detail 
and was at times ‘incoherent and unbelievable’.

Arguments: Michael Le Vell's legal team admitted he was troubled and had 'demons' but added this did not make him a sex offender

Going home: The actor, 48, was swept away by car yesterday as the jury began its deliberations

He
 said that there was no physical evidence to back up the victim’s 
claims: ‘There’s an agonising lack of detail from this witness. She 
can’t give you details because it did not happen and that’s why her 
story varies according to who she’s talking to.’

He
 dismissed prosecution assertions that, as an actor, Le Vell had been 
putting on a  performance in court: ‘Did you think he was acting?

‘Or
 was his evidence the scared and frightened evidence of a man who faces 
the most unbelievable and terrible thing ever to happen to a man – a 
girl saying he raped her?’

He
 said no child pornography was found on Le Vell’s computer, no adults 
had been uneasy having their children around him and he had no criminal 
convictions.

He told the 
jury that if they found the actor guilty they were ‘going to take a 
man’s life away from him’ and cast him into the ‘outer darkness’.

‘Nothing
 in this case has taken you anywhere near the level of certainty that 
you would need so that you can look in the mirror in the days that come 
and say, “I was sure”,’ he said.

The jury has retired to consider its verdicts.
