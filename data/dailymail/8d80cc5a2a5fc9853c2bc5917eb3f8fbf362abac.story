Kelly Brook’s arrival in Hollywood three months ago was a decidedly low-key affair. Instead of embracing her pin-up image, she let it be known that she was ‘reinventing’ herself as a serious actress.

In true Tinseltown style, she swiftly airbrushed her disastrous British television career from her biography, during which she was dumped as a judge on Britain’s Got Talent after just one appearance and axed from The Big Breakfast amid accusations that she couldn’t read the Autocue.

And in an effort to be seen as more than a lingerie model famous for flaunting her body, she posted a series of snaps on Instagram of herself cycling in the California sunshine and sparring in a gym.

But now it seems she has already ditched her attempts to be ‘taken seriously’ after landing a major role in a new prime-time US comedy TV series – a move she describes as ‘the biggest opportunity of my life’.

Next big thing: Kelly Brook has landed a major role in new prime-time US comedy TV series One Big Happy

To publicise the NBC show, called One Big Happy, a trailer stars a naked Kelly (tastefully pixelated) playing a studio audience for laughs with jokes about her ‘big boobs’. In the racy clip, she says playfully: ‘How would I do on the lesbian market? I don’t think I’ve ever been appraised.’

The role is tipped to promote her into the A-list, with TV producers touting her to the American press as ‘Britain’s Sofia Vergara’ – a reference to the bombshell Colombian actress and star of the hit show Modern Family. Sofia has become the highest-earning actress on US TV, raking in an estimated £22 million a year. And Kelly, 35, is only too happy to comply.

‘Sofia is someone I look up to,’ she says. ‘She has a fantastic, fun accent and she’s a sexy woman but does comedy so well. If I could try to be a little like that, that would be great.

‘I’d love a bit of her success. I’ve always been the brunt of the joke. I’ve always been the stooge.’

HER new role is certainly lucrative, with some reports claiming that she has earned £550,000 for six episodes. In several shots she is seen topless (suitably pixelated).

‘Kelly is back doing what she does best,’ said a friend last night. ‘It was a very conscious decision. She knows it’s something of a cliche for her to be the glamour girl showing off her breasts, but she is convinced that, at 35, this is her last big chance to break into Hollywood.

‘Despite all her past talk of reinvention, of becoming a serious actress or presenter, she knows it was her body that caught the eye of the show’s producers. She finally gets it that it is her body that will bring her to the attention of the public in America.

‘She accepts she has always been a bit of a figure of fun in England. But what people don’t realise is that there’s a ruthless streak in Kelly. She’s tough and she’s a survivor.

Kelly arrived in Hollywood three months ago to reinvent herself as a serious actress

‘The very fact she’s made it on to a prime-time comedy show in the US is something to be applauded when you think about how many girls arrive in Hollywood each year trying to get work.’ And as proof that Kelly is determined to ensure her pin-up statistics get the maximum coverage, she has posted a slow-motion video of herself on social media in a tiny pink and orange bikini emerging sexily from an LA swimming pool.

Informing her fans last week that she has shed 7lb on the Atkins diet, she shows off her leaner shape in a series of provocative poses.

Kelly’s new show, which premieres in the US next month, is the brainchild of talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres, who has become something of a mentor to Kelly. One Big Happy stars up-and-coming Canadian actress Elisha Cuthbert (who played Kim Bauer in 24), and Nick Zano, star of Melrose Place.

Elisha’s character Lizzy is a lesbian who decides she wants to have a baby with her straight childhood friend Luke (Zano). But things become complicated when Luke meets Prudence (Kelly), a ‘free-spirited British girl’, in a bar and falls instantly in love. When Lizzy finally finds out she is pregnant, Luke announces that he and Prudence are married – creating one very different ‘family’.

Kelly’s performance has been a big hit with the show’s writer and executive producer, Liz Feldman.

She says: ‘Our US casting director, Julie Ashton, found Kelly after a long and exhaustive search. She remembered her from her days on the TV series Smallville [in 2001] and sought her out in England.

‘We had seen hundreds of women for the part of Prudence. People were auditioning on three continents. We saw some lovely, talented actresses but no one quite had the right balance between beautiful and funny until Kelly came along.’

Kelly, pictured hosting Channel 4's Big Breakfast with Johnny Vaughan, has airbrushed her disastrous UK television career from her biography 

She adds: ‘Kelly’s tape was sent to me on a Saturday night and I immediately knew she was a star, though I wasn’t at all familiar with her. She flew to LA two days later to do her screen test, blew us all away, and the role was hers by Friday.

‘We were having a hard time finding a bombshell beauty who could really do comedy. I was so relieved when she came in to do her screen test because she made me laugh.

‘It’s obvious to everyone that she’s gorgeous but it’s certainly unexpected that she can really land a joke. It’s extremely rare to find someone that gorgeous and that hilarious.

‘She’s already a star – America just doesn’t know it yet. But they will, because she really does shine on the screen. She’s so likeable and has such great energy and timing, I think audiences are going to be very taken with her.

‘I really hope One Big Happy airs in the UK. The character of Prudence comes from that love and enchantment I have with England. So it would be a dream for it to be shown there. And I would love for everyone in the UK to see just how fantastic Kelly is on the show. I think people will fall in love with her in a new way.’

The actress herself, well-known for her high-profile romances with Hollywood stars Jason Statham and Billy Zane, says the role has transformed her life.

‘I was living in a little cottage in the English countryside when I read the script. I had a lovely life in England. I own a restaurant, I’m very busy. It took a lot for me to leave my family and my life and come here, but when I read the script I don’t think I’d reacted to anything so profoundly in a long time. It was just a case of “I need to get on a plane and try to get that job”.’

‘Initially, I put myself on tape and sent it to Ellen and the producers and they said “Yes, fly out” and I was on a plane the next day, and it’s been a rollercoaster since then.

Kelly has previously had high profile romances Hollywood stars Billy Zane and Jason Statham

‘I think they saw about 400 girls and I came in at the 11th hour.

‘When I flew in, they had a few girls lined up and the girl who came before me said, “You have to kiss in the audition!” And I thought, “Oh well, I just have to go for it.”

‘There are not that many roles for British girls who look like me or sound like me on American television. I’m not going to get a role on Downton Abbey, let’s be honest.

‘So I just went in there and it clicked and that was that.’
