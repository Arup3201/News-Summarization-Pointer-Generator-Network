The lawyer for Rep. Michele Bachmann’s former chief of staff said his client will admit that the Minnesota congresswoman’s 2012 presidential campaign paid an Iowa state senator to work for her, in violation of House ethics rules and federal election law.

Andy Parrish will show an Iowa legislative ethics panel proof, according to his lawyer, that Bachmann fundraiser Guy Short used his private Iowa consulting firm to funnel $7,500 per month to state Sen. Kent Sorenson for working on the failed Bachmann presidential campaign.

Parrish was previously referred to as 'Witness A' in committee documents, acknowledged his lawyer John Hugh Gilmore, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.

Minnesota Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann traveled to London for Baroness Margaret Thatcher's funeral, providing her and her staff with a welcome break from questions about the ethical clouds hanging over her office and her failed 2012 presidential campaign

Bachmann pressed the flesh in 2011 with Iowa campaign manager Kent Sorenson, a state senator who later jumped ship to work for Texas Rep. Ron Paul

Sorenson has called the ethics charges against him 'totally baseless, without evidence, and a waste of Iowans’ time and money.' Bachmann's attorneys have also denied that she did anything wrong.

But there's no love lost between Sorenson and Bachmann: Despite the alleged payments that he added to his state legislative salary, he left the Bachmann campaign in December 2011 to work for rival Rep. Ron Paul.

Election law and legislative ethics rules forbid state representatives in Iowa from accepting money to campaign for other candidates.

Parrish, said Gilmore, will swear out an affidavit and provide supporting documents.

The case against Sorenson and 
Bachmann was launched after another former aide, a Florida pastor named 
Peter Waldron, came forward with the same allegations.

He
told the Star-Tribune that Parrish's decision to say what he knows 
suggests an 'impeccable character and a sense of civic duty that is 
extraordinary.'

This April 9 press event turned into a melee when reporters asked tough questions about alleged Bachmann payments to an Iowa state legislator for campaign work, and staffers quickly rushed her out of the room

Michele Bachmann's book 'Core of Conviction' sold poorly despite a full-court press to market it as a campaign tool before the Iowa Caucuses.

Bachmann 
has come under a separate cloud of suspicion over unrelated charges that
she used campaign staffers to promote and sell her book, Core Of 
Conviction, while on the presidential campaign trail in 2012.

The independent Office of Congressional Ethics is investigating the 
claim, according to two former campaign staffers who spoke to the Star-Tribune on condition of anonymity.

A Bachmann campaign lawyer says the book's publisher paid to promote the book and covered the expenses of a book tour. It's unclear, however, who paid top campaign staffers to accompany Bachmann to book-signing events and gather the small crowds that met her.

Emails seen by the Star-Tribune 
indicate that Bachmann's Iowa campaign manager and fundraiser were 
intimately involved in the book's promotion.

The book did not sell well, with some estimates putting its total performance at fewer than 3,000 copies.

Blogger and attorney John Hugh Gilmore (L) was booked into the Hennepin County Jail for disorderly conduct and failing to cooperate with arresting officers. He represents Andy Parrish (R), a former Bachmann chief of staff who ahs accused her of campaign finance wrongdoing

Meanwhile,
state Rep. Sorenson faces his own separate political headache, with a 
former staffer accusing him of raiding her personal computer to steal a 
private list of Iowa home-schooling families, presumably for fundraising
purposes. A criminal investigation in that case is ongoing.

And Parrish's attorney, a well-known right-wing activist who writes the Minnesota Conservatives blog, has faced credibility problems since he was arrested in 2011 for disorderly conduct in an altercation with two hijab-wearing Muslim women in Minneapolis.

Police in that case reported that he was drunk, according to the Twin Cities-based Citypages. A YouTube video shows him attempting to contact conservative firebrand Andrew Breitbart, who was in town for a conservative online convention. Breitbart died in 2012.

On April 9 a Bachmann press conference about Medicaid payments to doctors turned into a shoving match with reporters when the congresswoman's aides hustled her out of sight after the journalists raised questions about the Federal Election Commission and Office of Congressional Ethics investigations hanging over her head.

Bachmann's press secretary did not respond to an email seeking comment.
