Is this elderly conservative crusader the best radio talkback caller of the year?

2GB's Alan Jones received a call from a blue-rinse listener named 'Barbara' on Thursday morning and she left quite a lasting impression on the veteran broadcaster.

She called to express her dismay at seeing Prime Minister Tony Abbott and former PM John Howard booed by the crowd at Gough Whitlam's memorial service in Sydney on Wednesday.

But what started out like the average host-listener chat quickly turned on its head when Barbara, who may not have been all she said she was, had to pause the live conversation to put her cat out. 

'Did you see those idiots booing our prime minister and John Howard and his wife as they went into the hall,' she told Jones.

'I did. Cheered Julia Gillard,' he replied.

'Absolute disgrace. You see 'em there with their scarves and their soy lattes and their problems that they have with their university funding. Go out and get a job,' she said.

Amused people took to Twitter following the call in a bid to find out if Barbara really was who she said

Barbara's rant had Jones  in a laughing fit from the very second she opened her mouth

But Barbara wasn't finished yet and her rant already had Jones  in a laughing fit.

'All our tax dollars are being munched up by them, they all look well fed too, with their organic cookies and their products they get from the bloody organic home-grown such and such, you know,' she said.

'Places that they have down there in those left wing sides of town, it really upsets me Alan when we're struggling to get a slice of bread.

'Drop a bomb that's what I say. What a perfect place to drop a bomb.'

Jones only managed to get in one word as he told Barbara she was 'brilliant'.

'Who's the little fat fella? The Palmer man... he's okay, I don't mind him but I think he needs to go on a diet,' she continued. 

'Jenny Craig, Jenny Craig could help that man, I think.

'Tony Abbott's just got to stop winking at people! I mean, he's an attractive man. He's been doing the fun runs or whatever they call them.'
