By virtue of the fact he arrived at the club costing the square root of zero, Craig Gordon gains an exemption from the debate over Celtic’s greatest pound-for-pound signing on a technicality.

Were the issue to be widened to simply the best bargain the club has ever landed, however, there is no question the 31-year-old’s name is fast approaching being used in the same breath as the likes of £650,000 Henrik Larsson and £900,000 Victor Wanyama.

There’s a clear distinction to be made between the backdrop to Gordon’s arrival and that of those heroes of yesteryear. Larsson may have been unhappy and under-utilised while at Feyenoord but he had had no serious injuries at that stage. Likewise Beerschot’s emerging Kenyan powerhouse.

By contrast, Gordon hadn’t played a competitive game in two years. The toll of a broken arm and a knee injury sustained while at Sunderland cast a shadow – and many a question mark – over his suitability.

For those critics of a transfer policy that was obviously ushering Fraser Forster to the exit door, the acquisition of a free-agent like Gordon seemed further evidence of downsizing. How wrong they have been.

In the aftermath of a flawless display against Dinamo Zagreb on Thursday, Gordon’s contribution was underscored by the embraces of his grateful team-mates.

The Great Wall, as the Catalan Press called the mighty Forster, may now be stationed on the South Coast but Gordon already appears to be an equally formidable barrier. So much for the old wisdom about getting nothing for free in this life.

‘I just keep trying to improve,’ he reflected. ‘I’ll do that regardless of whether I’m playing well or poorly.

‘I always want to improve my game. There have been a few difficult games especially in Europe where I’ve had to produce a few saves but that’s what I’m there for.

‘I’m feeling more comfortable every week. It’s small things like decision-making – when to come out and when to stay in – that can be more difficult sometimes than making instinctive saves.

‘It’s those small things in the game that people maybe don’t realise. They are the last things to come back when you’ve been out for so long.

‘Judging the flight of cross balls, balls over the top of the defence – when to come out and when to stay, just getting your angles right for shots from different places on the park, and just really knowing where the goal is behind you. They take time.

‘These are just little things that come with playing the position and getting games under my belt.’

As Dinamo found to their cost, Gordon’s shot-stopping powers appear to be returning to the level that persuaded Sunderland to make him Britain’s most expensive goalkeeper at £9million seven years ago.

Time and again the Croats asked questions of the giant figure clad in green but by the end of the night his heroics had demoralised them. Wilson Eduardo, their Portuguese winger, spurned five opportunities and will be seeing Gordon in his nightmares for some time to come.

But if the keeper never doubted that he still had nuts and bolts in his toolbag to do the physical side of the job, he admitted he harboured concerns as to how he’d handle the mental side of returning after such a lengthy hiatus.

‘I honestly never thought it was there. But perhaps subconsciously, without really thinking about it, I had to cross a bridge psychologically,’ he added.

‘I was nervous when I first played again as I was concerned with how things would go. I still get nervous before every match but that’s getting less with every game I play now.

‘I’m just going out there and training as much as I can to try and improve.’

Little wonder Ronny Deila and his players spent the aftermath of the game praising their No 1 to the high heavens. The history books will show that Kris Commons’ sweet early strike was the difference between the teams but even the goal-scorer was anxious that the real accolades went to the man between the sticks.

Coupled with a fine opening draw in Salzburg, Deila’s men now have something tangible to build on. No matter that the season so far has felt stop-start in nature, four-points gained from sides of considerable calibre nods towards progress being made.

‘After the disappointment of going out of the Champions League, this has turned out to be another really difficult group with some real quality teams in it,’ Gordon continued.

‘I don’t think the teams we’ve played so far would be at all out of place in the Champions League.

‘In fact, the boys were saying in there that the past two games we’ve played in this competition were maybe of a higher standard than the games we played to try and qualify for the Champions League.

‘So it’s good teams we are playing against. There are no poor teams at this stage. They’re of a standard where it’s still extremely hard to get points on the board.

‘It’s a great result and one which puts is in a very strong position now.

‘We feel in the games coming up (against Astra) we can get six points to get to the 10 point mark and that would give us a great chance of going through.

‘We’ve made a really good start but we’re taking nothing for granted.

‘We know we’ve got to go on and pick up a few more wins to make sure we get out of the group which would be a fine achievement.’

Having done the hard part, Gordon stressed how imperative it is that a promising start to the group isn’t undone in the double-header against the outsiders from Romania.

‘Something we have to be careful of is being caught on the counter-attack at home. You saw tonight that we let that happen,’ he went on.

‘We can’t take anything for granted from the two games that are coming up.

‘It’s easy to go into a game against a so-called lesser team only to lose the first goal. At this level it’s always hard to get back and then win the game.

‘We have to do what we do best and try to come out on top.

Celtic and Gordon will be looking to make it four wins in a row against Hamilton in the league on Sunday

‘If we were to get through this group it would give us something special to look forward to in the second half of the season but that’s a long way away yet.’

For the first time since Deila arrived at Celtic Park, his side have strung together three successive wins. Look closely enough and there might even be a hint of a feel-good factor emerging.

For the momentum to build and for the many floating voters on the new regime to be won over though, victory against Hamilton on Sunday is mandatory.

‘They’ve been doing brilliant and have been playing some really good stuff,’ Gordon offered. ‘We’re under no illusions that’s it’s going to be a difficult game. They are up there on merit by playing some great football.

‘It’s will be a difficult game for us but it’s one we are desperate to win so we go into the international break in a better position.
