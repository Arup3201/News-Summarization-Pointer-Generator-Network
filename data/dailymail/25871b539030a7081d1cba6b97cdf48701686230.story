A 12-year-old boy is fighting for his life after developing a rare infection caused by an amoeba attacking and eating his brain.

Zachary Reyna fell critically ill after playing on a knee board with friends in a ditch near his LaBelle, Florida home.

If he recovers from the infection caused by the brain-eating amoeba he will be only the four person to have survived.

Risks: Zachary is being treated in hospital, above, for an infection only three people are known to have survived

The single cell Naegleria Fowleri or brain-eating amoeba, lives in warm fresh water and attacks the brain after entering the body through the nose, according to Naples News.

In the past 50 years only 31 have contracted the rare primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (Pam) infection, and only three have survived so far.

'He can be number four. That's what we're hoping for, for him to be number four,' Zachary's brother, Brandon Villarreal, said.

The family first noticed there was something seriously wrong with Zachary after he slept for a whole day after playing with friends on August 3.

At first they thought he had a 24 hour virus, but soon realized there was something seriously wrong with the usually active, baseball loving child.

'I wish I could just touch him and it would transfer over. It don't work like that,' Brandon told ABC7. 'It's just tough to see him like this.'

Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is as rare as it is horrific.

It is caused by an amoeba that implants itself in its victim's brains - usually when infected water shoots up their nose.

The amoeba grows in the sediment at the bottom of pools of warm, stagnant water and is most active at about 85F.

The water must reach a relatively high temperature for the parasites to reach numbers that threaten humans.

Health officials have recorded only 125 instances of the disease in the United States in the past 50 years.

Only two people have survived in the U.S. One other survivor was found in Mexico

Swimmers can reduce their risk by:

The family have been keeping a vigil by his bedside at Miami Children's Hospital, where Zachary has been sedated.

'[It]
will actually eat away at the tissue; it literally eats the tissues,' 
Dr Mark Heulitt told KATV. 'It is a severe form of meningitis where your
brain will be eaten by the amoeba.'

Brandon is positive that his little brother, who loves to play baseball, will pull through.

'He's fighting and he's strong, he's really, really strong,' he said.

Swimmers have been warned to be careful in still water around Florida, as health officials try to prevent further infections.

The amoeba is common in warm, stagnant water in central Florida, especially in the summer.

Health officials have advised swimmers and water skiers to wear nose clips as a safety precaution because it cuts off the only way the amoeba can enter the body and do damage.

A Department of Health spokesman told MailOnline the water must to be forcefully, almost violently, pushed up the nose - as it can be after diving into the water, being dunked or using a water slide.

Three boys, aged between 10 and 14, developed the infection last year after wakeboarding or swimming.

Mark Zeitler, whose nephew of Will Sellers, who died from the infection last year, has warned people to stay away from water in the summer. 

'We're not trying to be alarmists, but 
as that water heats up, find other places to recreate,' Mr Zeitler told 
the Orlando Sentinel.

Warning signs: Zachary's family realized he was sick when the usually active child could not stop sleeping

It can take up to a week for the infection to show symptoms, which include headaches, fever, vomiting and seizures.

A 12-year-old girl who developed the condition in July is still in hospital after managing to fight off the infection.

Kali Hardig came in contact with the amoeba as she swam in a sandy bottom lake at Willow Springs Water Park near Little Rock, Arkansas.
