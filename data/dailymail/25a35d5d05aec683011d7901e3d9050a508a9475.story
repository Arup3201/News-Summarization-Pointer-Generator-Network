A police officer from the force which is overseeing anti-fracking protests has branded activists 'scum' on Twitter.

The unnamed PC from Sussex Police posted the ill advised tweet from a personal account.

The slur has since been deleted from Twitter, but not before a member of the public reported it to the force's official Twitter page.

Responding to the offensive comment, which was directed at protestors in Balcome, West Sussex, tweeter Sussex Owl said:  '#balcombe @sussex-police should your officers really be calling protesters ‘scum’ on twitter? I suggest you issue some guidance ASAP.'

The force responded swiftly on Twitter saying: 'Absolutely not - please point us towards the account you mention.'

Sussex Police responded tweeting: 'Thank you, we will follow this up.'

Soon after the officer was identified and told to remove his Tweet.

A spokesperson for the force described the comments as “unhelpful and not acceptable”.

The officer has since been given 'management advice' about their behaviour.

A force statement said: 'Sussex Police has received a report of a personal Twitter account belonging to a Sussex officer, which is abusive to protesters at Balcombe.

'The officer has been identified and has received management advice about their actions.

'We have worked hard to engage with everyone involved in and affected by the activities surrounding the drilling operation at Balcombe and no matter who authors them, such comments are unhelpful and not acceptable.'

For more than seven weeks, Sussex Police has been overseeing the encampment of dozens of activists outside an exploratory oil drilling site in Balcombe.

Amid sometimes tense scenes, officers have been ensuring deliveries enter the site where energy firm Cuadrilla has been conducting test drilling.

Although no hydraulic fracturing has been taking place, the village has been thrust to the forefront of anti-fracking protests.

More than 100 arrests have been made since the demonstrations sprung up in July.

Among those arrested was Brighton Pavilion Green MP Caroline Lucas, pictured below, during two days of 'direct action'.

The cost of the policing operation in 
Balcombe has hit more than £2.4 million, leading Sussex’s police and 
crime commissioner Katy Bourne to ask the Home Office for financial 
help.

A bid to move on the 
protesters this week hit the buffers after West Sussex County Council 
went to London’s High Court asking for a possession order for the verges
where the camp is set up.

But Mrs Justice Lang adjourned the application after describing it as “flawed”, with the result that if the council does not apply to restore it in a new form by October 8, it will be either withdrawn or dismissed.

A spokesman for the camp said afterwards: “We are so happy that we can now stay to finish our protest and then leave in a peaceful way once Cuadrilla have left.

“This will give us time to clear and clean up, and to rethink and regroup for future action against oil and gas drilling in Balcombe and elsewhere in the country where new drilling sites are in the offing.”

West Sussex County Council accepted the court’s decision but said the camp was unsafe beside a busy rural road with a 60mph speed limit and which is unlit at night.
