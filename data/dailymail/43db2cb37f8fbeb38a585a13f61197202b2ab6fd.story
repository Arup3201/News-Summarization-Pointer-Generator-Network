The Texas mother who gave birth to quintuplets on Tuesday has said that she and her husband will not be having any more children since the newborns already have a big brother to come home to.

'This is it. No more. Half a dozen is plenty for us,' Michelle Seals said on Thursday.

Each of the quintuplets born in Texas on Tuesday are in good health.

There were no unusual complications in the delivery, which was the first quintuplet birth to take place at Baylor University Hospital in Dallas.

Tiny: The four girls weighed under 3 pounds while the only boy weighed 3 pounds and 6 ounces

Proud parents: Michelle and her husband Steven Seals held a press conference on Thursday and they said that they will not be having any more children, especially since they already have a 2-year-old at home

'This has been a long ride for us, and it's definitely been an interesting ride,' father Steven Seals said according to CBS News.

The four girls weighed under 3 pounds while the only boy weighed 3 pounds and 6 ounces.

'They're so precious,' Mrs Seals said during a press conference Thursday.

'They're tiny, and I just love it. I thought I'd be scared because of all of the machines, but I just love it. I can't wait to get my hands on them.'

They are all being monitored in the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit. A mix of 24 doctors and nurses were involved in the delivery.

'I thought I'd be scared because of all of the machines, but I just love it. I can't wait to get my hands on them,' Michelle Seals said

Deceptive: The babies are all said to be in good health but are being monitored in the neonatal unit regardless

Ready to grow: The hospital has not released any predictions about when the children will be released

They have been named Mia, Tessa, Brant, Gracie and Rayleigh and range in weight from 2 lbs 7 oz to 3 lbs 6 oz.

Mrs Seal had been ordered on bedrest as of her 25th week of pregnancy at the end of February, and she told KLTV that feeling her babies move inside her was one of the highlights.

'I love it, it's the best part about being pregnant is feeling them move - except for the one that's in my ribs,' she joked.

Ahead of the birth, her husband added: 'It's happiness, it's fearfulness and I'm scared to death.'

Protective: Steven Seals stayed in their home in Maud, Texas while Michelle was on bedrest for weeks in order to take care of their 2-year-old son and take him to school while he worked

Tense: Steven was allowed to be by his wife's side when they were performing the c-section

By her side: The hospital released this photo of a tender moment between the couple

Without going into specifics, Mrs Seal suggested that the multiple birth was a result of previous fertility work.

'The problems I've had in the past, I had to take medicine and it just worked really, really well and we got five out of it,' she told KTLA in February.

Mother's touch: Michelle previously said that feeling the babies kick inside her was her favorite part of the pregnancy

'But one thing about it is we'll have four girls to help us when we're older.'

Mr Seals works at the Red River Army Depot and graduated from Stephen F. Austin State University in 2004.

Mrs Seals, who works as a first grade teacher, attended the University of North Texas and the couple married in December 2006.
