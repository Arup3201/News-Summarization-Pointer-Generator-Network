Secret recordings have emerged of Australia's Manus Island facility, showing inside the asylum seeker compounds.

A former detention centre guard took photographs of the 'filthy' living conditions before he quit his job in disgust.

Beau Mitchell told the ABC that he wasn't surprised Iranian asylum seeker Hamid Kehazaei died from an infection he caught at the detention centre. 

Hamid Kehazaei, who had been detained on Australia's Manus Island facility, died on Friday after an infection in a cut foot deteriorated to septicaemia

'There's no air conditioning, the beds are extremely close together. The living standards are pretty quite filthy,' Mr Mitchell said

'Often they'd be standing on concrete to have a shower that was literally falling apart underneath them, just completely rotting away.'

Mr Kehazaei, 24, is believed to have spent days seeking treatment for a cut on his foot that had been there for weeks whilst he was detained at Manus Island in Papua New Guinea.

The 24-year-old was initially transferred to a Port Moresby hospital to treat his septicaemia last Wednesday, where he had a heart attack before being sent to Brisbane. 

He was then declared brain dead on Tuesday at Mater Private Hospital on Tuesday. His family made the heartbreaking decision to turn off his life support on Friday.

Mr Mitchell says he used secret cameras to document the conditions inside the detention centre.

He says he was so repulsed that it prompted him to quit his job in June.

However he stresses that medical staff at the facility are doing what they can to best tend to the needs of detainees.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison confirmed Mr Kehazaei's death on Friday evening.

'I am very saddened by this man's passing and on behalf of the Australian government I extend our deepest sympathy to the man's family and friends,' Mr Morrison said in a statement.

'My department has and will continue to provide support to the family and has been in contact with family members during the course of the man's treatment,' he said, adding that the name and age of the man would not be released, subject to agreement from his family.'

Mr Kehazaei's death has caused outrage among many, including the Greens immigration spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young and refugee advocate Ian Rintoul.

But Mr Morrison rejected suggestions the care provided to Mr Kehazaei was inadequate.

'When someone becomes ill they receive outstanding care from the people who work as part of our mainland detention network,' he said.

Mr Morrison has asked the immigration department's chief medical officer to review Mr Kehazaei's treatment.

'I will base my assessment of that treatment on facts and not Facebook,' he said.

Mr Rintoul claimed asylum seekers on Manus Island sometimes had to walk through raw sewage and that Mr Kehazaei's death was 'senseless and inexcusable'.

'Hamid's death speaks for the medical neglect, and to the culture of punishment, and indifference that pervades Manus Island,' he said.

'Infections and skin disease are endemic in the detention centre. It is unhygienic, unsanitary and unsafe.'

Opposition immigration spokesman Richard Marles said Labor continued to be concerned about the lack of transparency surrounding the treatment of asylum seekers. 

Labor has called for the review to be made public as soon as possible.
