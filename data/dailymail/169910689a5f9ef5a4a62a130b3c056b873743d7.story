When the Eagles decided to make a career-spanning documentary, their music was only ever going to be one part of the warts ’n’ all story.

The Eagles redefined West Coast rock after forming in Los Angeles in 1972. They sold 120 million albums and provided the soundtrack for a generation of baby boomers with hits like Take It Easy, One Of These Nights and Hotel California.

But History Of The Eagles, out now on DVD, doesn’t neglect the extra-curricular side of an outfit who lived up to the title of their 1976 song Life In The Fast Lane. As singer and drummer Don Henley admits, ‘drugs, girls and fights’ loomed large.

Take the infamous concert in Long Beach, 
California, in 1980, when tensions between guitarists Don Felder and 
Glenn Frey came to an ugly head.

Felder felt he should be given more opportunity to sing lead vocals. Frey, and the rest of the band, disagreed.

Before the show, Frey broke a beer bottle against the dressing room wall. Afterwards, Felder smashed his guitar before storming off into the night.

The concert - a benefit gig, no less - was played out amid muttered onstage threats (all captured on the DVD). At one point, Frey is caught whispering he is going to kill Felder after ‘three more songs, ass****!’.

The Eagles didn’t play together for another 14 years, Don Henley famously commenting that they would only reunite ‘when hell freezes over’. No prizes for guessing what they called their 1994 comeback tour.

‘We were never really at each other’s throats,’ insists Frey, 64, rather unconvincingly. ‘We specialised in a quiet turbulence. That Long Beach concert was unfortunate. We fought because we were passionate about the band.’

‘Men grow up slowly, especially in the music business,’ adds Henley, 65. ‘We started this band in our 20s, but we were kids, really. We’ve learned how to tolerate one another now. Our differences are not as dramatic.’

The film’s best footage is its early archive material, telling the tale of how Detroit-born Frey (pronounced ‘Fry’) and the Texan Henley met in LA.

They toured as Linda Ronstadt’s backing band before launching the Eagles with guitarist Bernie Leadon and bassist Randy Meisner. ‘We lived for the moment,’ Henley tells me. ‘Our label, Asylum, booked us into a club in Aspen, Colorado, because we needed to play to people. It was a wooden shed, but we had some wild times there. It was a hippy town, and everybody was on drugs.

‘We were never really at each other’s throats,’ insists Frey, 64. ‘We specialised in a quiet turbulence.'

‘We tempered our bad habits, though. We never let bingeing get in the way of work. I’d drink and take drugs all weekend, but I’d go to the gym on Monday morning to clean it all out. We had a survival instinct — every current and former member of the Eagles is still alive.’

Mixing country rock, catchy pop and finely wrought harmonies, the Eagles secured an unexpected hit with their self-titled debut album, but fared poorly, initially at least, with its follow-up, Desperado, dismissed as ‘a cowboy record’ on account of its Western-style sleeve.

‘We didn’t want to be pigeonholed, so there was a lot of variation on the early albums,’ says Henley. ‘We played bluegrass, country, rock, blues and soul. It was an organic way of developing as we searched for a direction.’

If Joe Walsh’s 1976 arrival gave the Eagles a keener rock ’n’ roll edge, the wild-card guitarist’s unpredictable streak brought new problems. With friend Keith Moon, Walsh became known as the king of the hotel room-trash. Soon, the band were barred from all the best establishments.

Now 65, a clean and sober Walsh admits his antics were fuelled by his insecurity around Frey and Henley — superior talents in his eyes — although things took a darker turn after the band’s 1980 split.

‘When we stopped, I was sad and didn’t know what to do,’ he says. ‘So I kept going. I became an alcoholic and dependent on drugs. I hit rock-bottom.’

It took the band’s 1994 reunion to convince Walsh that there was an alternative to oblivion. Schmit, also 65, explains: ‘He looked so bad. I think the offer to rejoin the band saved him.’

Since then, the Eagles have soared, and inspired by the documentary (to be shown on BBC2 in June), they are gearing up for a two-year world tour.

‘As a band, we had so many issues I’m surprised we ever wrote any songs,’ says Henley. ‘But, somehow, we got it done.’

History Of The Eagles is  out on DVD and Blu-ray.
