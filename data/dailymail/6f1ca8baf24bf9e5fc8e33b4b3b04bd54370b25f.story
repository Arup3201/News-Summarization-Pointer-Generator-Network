They're both famous singers who have lent their powerful voices to James Bond films.

And it seems the Oscars' stage wasn't big enough to accommodate larger-and-life divas Adele and Dame Shirley Bassey, at least at the same time.

Instead of the two songstresses dueting or sharing the stage, each performed her theme song separately during Sunday night's ceremony.

Battle of the divas: Adele and Dame Shirley Bassey separately sang James Bond theme songs during Sunday night's Oscar ceremony

Shirley performed first, singing 
Goldfinger nearly 50 years since she first recorded the song for the 
1964 Bond film of the same name.

And the 76-year-old proved she is still every inch the talented diva that she's known for.

The Welsh singer brought the house down when she belted out the iconic tune, receiving a standing ovation at the end.

A true star: Dame Shirley brought down the house with her rendition of James Bond theme son Goldfinger during Sunday night's Oscars ceremony 

She's still got it: The 76-year-old looked far younger than her years in her sparkling gold gown and youthful energy on stage 

The dame from Tiger Bay looked far 
younger than her years in a tight-fitting floor-length glittering gold 
gown. She accessorised with a thick gold necklace and gold earrings.

Her short hair was stylishly coiffed and she further upped the glamorous factor with her deep red lipstick.

The
 Diamonds Are Forever singer was animated and passionate, spreading her 
arms wide and displaying a face full of emotion during her performance.

The diamonds are hers: The Welsh singer said, 'I'll be wearing my own jewels, I'm not borrowing them. I own them'

Adele appeared onstage later in the ceremony to sing Skyfall, the theme to the most recent Bond film of the same name.

The 24-year-old - more than 50 years Shirley's junior- sung the Oscar-nominated song with typical aplomb, accompanied by an orchestra and an all-male choir.

The British star looked gorgeous in a sparkling gold-and-black Burberry dress that fell below the knee, paired with glittering silver heels.

Her blonde hair was full and voluminous as it tumbled in curls over her shoulder.

Later in the ceremony, Adele was awarded the Oscar for Best Original Score for Skyfall, which means she pulled off an amazing hat-trick having won a Golden Globe, a Grammy, and now an Oscar, and she's only 24 years old.

While 007 themes have long been a beloved movie tradition,
they've never before won an Oscar.

Three previous Bond tunes were nominated: For Your Eyes Only, Nobody Does It Better, and Live and Let Die.

The Oscar extends Adele's award show dominance, leaving
only an Emmy eluding her of the major American awards.

She accepted the Oscar
with producer Paul Epworth, with whom she wrote the lyrics and composed the
music.

Later, it was like a summit of divas as Barbra Streisand, Shirley and Adele bonded over shepherds pie at the Oscar Governors Ball.

The three stars  were at one of the prime banquets at the star-studded ball held after the Oscar ceremony.

Streisand and Adele sat opposite each other in a circular banquet divided into a quartet.

Shirley skipped over to huddle with Streisand before hugging Adele and posing with the Oscar she won for best song.

'We Bond girls stick together' said Shirley as Adele placed the golden statuette in her hands.

'Here, hold that', said Adele to Shirley.

'I'm thrilled for her, thrilled she won.She's such a star with such a gorgeous voice,' said Shirley of Adele.

Adele was equally admiring and said she was excited to have been on the same show as Dame Shirley.

The three divas left together and said they were heading for the Vanity Fair Party at the Sunset Marquee on Sunset Boulevard.

Before performing, Adele walked the red carpet in a bespoke Jenny Packham dress.

While walking on the red carpet prior to the ceremony, Shirley said that she would be performing 'my Bond song and Adele will be singing hers'.

The dame said it was 'the thrill of a lifetime' to be performing at her first Oscar show.

She added: 'I'll be wearing my own jewels, I'm not borrowing them. I own them'.

On the carpet she wore a black Isabel Christianson gown
but will change into a gold one for the show.

'It matches the song', she said.

Bassey added that she works out every day in the gym and watches
what she eats.
