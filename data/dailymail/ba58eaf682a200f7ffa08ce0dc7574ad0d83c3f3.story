Military chiefs should resign over defence cuts before British troops become America’s ‘cannon fodder’, politicians and former top brass warned last night.

Tory MP Colonel Bob Stewart, a member of the defence select committee, called for the Joint Chiefs to sacrifice their careers over plans to slash defence spending despite growing threats from Russia and Islamic State.

Speaking at a meeting of the UK National Defence Association (UKNDA), he said the generals should make the people they command their priority and resign on principle, instead of focusing their efforts on ‘getting another star’.

Colonel Bob Stewart, a former British commander in Bosnia, said Britain's military forces were in a 'parlous state' and could not take any further cuts

Later he said he was considering resigning himself, from either his seat or the select committee, adding: ‘I’m thinking about it to be honest – but that won’t make any difference.’

His comments came as it emerged more than 6,000 British troops are preparing to deploy under the command of an American unit as part of a high readiness reaction force.

Fresh details emerged of future military operations after the head of the US army, General Raymond Odierno, said he was ‘very concerned’ about UK defence cuts. He told the Telegraph Britain will be demoted to a more junior role in future campaigns if spending is inadequate.

David Cameron has resisted calls to make a public pledge not to cut military spending below 2 per cent - but had insisted he will not cut the size of the army any further

Former defence secretary Liam Fox has urged the Government not to cut military spending below 2 per cent

And yesterday, Sir Michael Graydon, former head of the RAF, said the idea of a UK brigade working under a 20,000-strong US division was ‘humiliating’. Air Commodore Andrew Lambert added: ‘The trouble with this is you provide the man power but with none of the authority. Why should we provide the man power – some people might call it cannon fodder – when what we would like to do is have a seat at the top table?’

During the meeting, former military top brass put pressure on the Government to commit Britain to meeting the Nato target of spending at least 2 per cent of national income on defence beyond 2016 – a prospect which looks unlikely.

In a blistering attack on UK military spending – which has diminished as Russia’s defence capabilities increase – Sir Michael added: ‘It is token already and if we start cutting it any more it becomes laughable.’

Colonel Stewart, who commanded UN forces in Bosnia, said: ‘If we are really [in] a parlous state in defence, why are the Joint Chiefs of Staff not tendering their resignations?

‘They should actually put their responsibilities to the people who they command as their top priority, rather than getting another star.’

A damning report published by the UKNDA said that if Britain is forced into a conflict with Russia, our force levels are ‘pitifully small’ compared to those at the end of the Cold War.

An MoD spokesman said: ‘We will meet the 2 per cent Nato spending target this year and next and have also committed to spending £163billion on equipment and equipment support to keep Britain safe.’

General Raymond Odierno, the Chief of Staff of the US army, last week warned he was 'very concerned' about the scale of the Coalition's military cuts
