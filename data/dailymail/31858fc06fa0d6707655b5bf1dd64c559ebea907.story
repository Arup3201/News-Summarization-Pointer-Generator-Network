United States military units in Afghanistan are in the midst of the biggest force pullout in American history and it's resulting in the biggest yard sale of military hardware in American history.

An estimated $50billion in military hardware - from armored vehicles to dining room sets, combat uniforms to vending machines - must be removed from the country by the end of 2014.

The cost of bringing equipment home is reach an estimated $6billion.

More than a decade of war is nearly over and the military no longer has use for much of the equipment. As a result, billions worth of hardware is being auctioned off online - much of it even available to civilians in the U.S.

Pulling out: Billions of dollars worth of military equipment must be airlifted out of Afghanistan as U.S. troops prepare to pullout at the end of next year

Billions of dollars more is being scrapped and sold for scrap metal at pennies on the pound.

The military is rushing to clear everything out of Afghanistan, or risk it falling into Taliban hands when American forces leave at the end of 2014.

Fox News reports that the online auction site Government Liquidation is gearing up to handle billions of dollars worth of surplus sales in online auctions.

The site generated more than $500million for the U.S. treasury by 2011 - before the massive draw-down efforts even began.

The operation, called a retrograde, is complicated by the fact that the military must move nearly all of the equipment out of Afghanistan before it can sell it.

Most of potential buyers, even allied militaries, aren't in a position to collect the equipment from war-torn Afghanistan.

The Afghan military, already overburdened with the logistics of training and fielding a security force, cannot handle much influx of American equipment and U.S. commanders fear that just dumping the hardware on the Afghan National Army would result in much of it falling into disuse or, worse, into enemy hands.

As a result, millions of tons of equipment must be shipped out of country, either by air freight or overland through Pakistan - both costly propositions.

'We’re making history doing what we’re doing here,' Major General Kurt Stein, the commander of the 1st Sustainment Command, told the Washington Post.

Down the drain: Some 2,000 MRAP vehicles are being torn down for scrap in Afghanistan because the military doesn't need them anymore and cannot sell them

'This is the largest retrograde mission in history.'

The transport numbers are staggering. The military will move 95,000 cargo containers out of Afghanistan and 35,000 vehicles. 

But, despite the military's claim of efficiency, there are casualties - billions being wasted.

The military own 25,500 Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles across the globe - including 11,000 in Afghanistan.

The vehicles were hastily-developed to cope with the IED threat of fighting an insurgency. In the rush to bring them to the battlefield, the military built too many. A report predicted that the military no longer has use for 12,300 of those vehicles - nearly half of the current inventory.

As a result, 2,000 of the MRAPs - which cost taxpayers $1million each to build - are being torn down and sold for scrap. The metal is worth pennies on the pound in the Afghanistan scrap market, the Post reports.
