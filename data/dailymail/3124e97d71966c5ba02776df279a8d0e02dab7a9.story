Lewis Hamilton, his bling twinkling in the flash bulbs, summoned the Mercedes PR man to hand him his phone. Quick, Jeeves.

Hamilton turned round to take a ‘selfie’ with the pre-Italian Grand Prix press conference throng, adopting the nonchalant air of a man without a care. Nico Rosberg sat on the other side of the front row, his arms firmly folded.

Fernando Alonso was sandwiched between them — just in case.

Trio: Ferrari's Fernando Alonso sat between feuding team-mates Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton

This was the first time we had seen Hamilton and Rosberg in such close proximity since they tangled at the Belgian Grand Prix a fortnight ago, and the body language yesterday was more instructive than their answers, which were often vague, coded or plain evasive.

Hamilton, it seemed, enjoyed holding the psychological edge over his title rival who has apologised for the crash, paid a six-figure fine to his Mercedes team for causing it and been reduced in the estimation of many for his perceived utter ruthlessness.

It was an all the more welcome feeling for Hamilton because he has lost virtually every mind-game of the season to the usually ice-veined Rosberg, who leads him at the top of the standings by 29 points.

Spa break: The two drivers came together in Belgium, Rosberg admitted the crash was his error 

Momentum, mechanical luck and championship points have all drained away from the British driver since he won in Spain in mid-May, when Mercedes chairman Niki Lauda proved himself to be the anti-Nostradamus by hailing Hamilton as ‘unbeatable’.

Since the Spa fracas, there has been a frank meeting of the squabbling protagonists and the Mercedes management at the team’s Brackley factory. But a truce is not a peace.

As if to prove all is not right, a smile played across each of their lips at a point when the other was in a slight fix.

It was Rosberg’s turn when Hamilton was asked if he had been penalised for ignoring a team order to let the German through during the previous race in Hungary.

Rivals: The pair have endured a tense relationship all season, but it has deteriorated in recent months 

He took an age to answer. ‘Um…well, I don’t really know,’ he finally ventured. ‘We always get a big slap on the wrist.’

Mercedes later said Hamilton was not fined, but the matter was discussed.

Hamilton’s moment to smirk came when he was asked if the FIA should have investigated the crash at Spa? ‘I think it’s a really good question,’ he said. ‘I don’t know the full answer to that really.’

Again and again we were left to decipher the code.

Hamilton was asked if trust had been restored. ‘Trust is a big word and it’s not something I would particularly apply to racing,’ he said. ‘Naturally, Nico and I have been racing for a long time and I think we set a good foundation a long, long time ago.’

Drivers' standings: Rosberg is currently leading the championship, while team-mate Hamilton is second

Decoded that reads: ‘I don’t trust him an inch. I have known him and his knavish tricks since we were boys.’

Did Hamilton now see the crash as nothing more than a racing incident? ‘What has happened in the past is in the past.’ Decoded: ‘No, he meant to do it and has had his comeuppance.’

Although some Hamilton fans will be horrified by the suggestion, it was a minor incident brought about by the two men racing hard. Rosberg pushed an inch or two too far. Little more.

He certainly did not deserve boos on the podium in Spa. ‘It was not a nice feeling,’ said the German. ‘I understand because they travelled a long way to watch a big battle between Lewis and me, and they didn’t get that. I accept that.’

Time was called after half an hour. Rosberg, last out of the room, gave Hamilton plenty of space as they left.
