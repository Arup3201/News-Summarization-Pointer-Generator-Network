Smitten to sour: Author Patricia Cornwell had a lesbian affair with a leading British police chief but she broke it off and told police that she was a threat to her

Best-selling author Patricia Cornwell had a lesbian affair with a leading British police chief when the pair became ‘smitten’ with each other.

But the crime writer, 56, broke off the liaison and later told detectives that Caroline Nicholl, a former chief superintendent with Thames Valley Police, was a threat to her.

The American’s relationship with Miss Nicholl was revealed in US court papers alleging that financial managers wasted her multi-million dollar fortune.

The women met through a mutual friend and their affair started when Miss Nicholl invited the writer to do research in Milton Keynes, where she was in charge of policing 17 years ago.

Miss Nicholl, 57, said: ‘Yes, we did have a relationship. It lasted a matter of months. We must have seen each other probably no more than ten times.

‘She was very smart, self-effacing and charming, and clearly was enamoured that I was a police chief. She thought the uniform was amazing.

‘I didn’t know who she was. I’d never read any of her books. So I was expecting an old biddy or something.

‘The next time we met was when she was on a book tour in London. I invited her up to Milton Keynes because she liked to do research. She was smitten with me and I was smitten with her.’

According to the documents filed in Boston, Miss Cornwell said the affair ‘ended badly’.

She listed Miss Nicholl at the top of a list of ‘enemies’ given to US police investigating suspected threats against her five years ago.

Emails from 2008 show that Miss Cornwell allegedly asked detectives to conduct checks on Miss Nicholl. She wrote: ‘I have a few names of people who we should be “aware” of in terms of them being a problem/threat to me.’

On Miss Nicholl, she said: ‘I once had a relationship with her that ended badly. I cut her off and wouldn’t have anything to do with her. She might have animosity. We should know where she is.’

Others on the list included a celebrity psychic, rival crime writer and two female journalists she claimed were jealous of her success.

Last night, Miss Nicholl told the Daily Mail that Miss Cornwell had abruptly ended their relationship but she was mystified by the claims.

‘I have had no contact with Patricia Cornwell since 1995 or 1996 and have no idea why she would have any “allegations” concerning myself,’ she said.

‘There wasn’t any incident or incidents other than Cornwell’s abrupt cessation of the brief transatlantic relationship. I was then living in Buckinghamshire, she in Virginia.’

Miss Nicholl gained a high profile for her alternative methods in Milton Keynes, such as criminals meeting their victims.

She was one of Britain’s youngest chief superintendents and featured in a Channel 4 documentary in 1995.

Three years later, she was head-hunted by police chiefs in Washington DC. She still lives in the US, running her own consultancy and working as a government advisor.

Miss Cornwell has sold 100million books and is best-known for her series of 20 novels featuring forensic pathologist Kay Scarpetta.

She is suing her former financial advisers for damages estimated at £65million for negligence and breach of contract.

The writer, who earns £6million a year, said she has had  to sell her fleet of sports cars and helicopter.

She faces counter-claims that she and her partner, Dr Staci Gruber, a Harvard  neuropsychologist, simply squandered the money.

A court heard how Miss Cornwell spent £3million on private jets and £25,000 a month on a flat in the Trump Tower in New York.
