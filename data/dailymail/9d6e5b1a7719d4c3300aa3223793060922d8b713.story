Though Heineken’s signature colour is green, someone didn’t want any green leaves to get in the way of their massive advert on the side of a New York City building.

The beer company said they would replace the trees after the tops were lopped off to make way for a ‘wallscape’ advertising the Tribeca Film Festival.

The beer company is currently investigating whether the third-party advert installer lopped off the tops of the ten-year-old honey locus trees to make way for the billboard.

Lopped off: The tops of several ten-year-old honey oak trees were hacked off in front of a massive Heineken advert promoting the Tribeca Film Festival

As DNAinfo.com exclusively reported, the New York City Parks Department is now conducting an investigation into the mystery pruners.

It is illegal to damage trees on city property, the Parks Department website reads, and is punishable by fines up to $14,000 and up to one year in prison.

A Heineken spokesperson told DNA Info that the company will replace the honey oaks ‘at our expense.’

They added: ‘In no way was this action sanctioned by us. We had nothing to do with it, and we find it to be reprehensible.’

A publicity representative for the Tribeca Film Festival told MailOnline ‘Those aren’t our ads, so I don’t know anything about that.

'It’s not our ad campaign.’

Billboard company Fuel Outdoor did not respond to MailOnline’s request for comment.

The advert, located on the busy intersection of West Houston and West Broadway, gives a wide nod to the film industry, and reads like a script.

It says: ‘CUT TO: The exterior of a New York City apartment building. From street level, we can barely make out what’s happening inside.’

The beer giant has come under fire of late for yet another reason - for being linked with illegal dog fighting in Asia.

Brutal: Two dogs in a ring are shown tearing at eachother, surrounded by a large crowd and Heineken banners

The beer company launched an 
urgent investigation after an internet photo of a brutal dog fight 
showed the ring was surrounded by their branded banners.

Thousands
have called for a boycott of their drinks because of the image from an 
unknown Asian country, believed to be in Mongolia.

Heineken said last week that it was 'as shocked and disappointed' as anyone who had seen their name linked to the blood sport.

The picture shows people filming a dogfight in a ring with the Heineken logo hanging from pillars above the crowd.

In an official statement on their own
Facebook site Heineken said: 'We are aware of images of dog fighting 
circulating online including our branding. We do not support such 
cruelty and are urgently investigating.'

However
many people called on the firm to speak out publicly against 
dogfighting, accusing them of backtracking after being 'caught out'.

One
Facebook user said: 'I am so not having anything to do with your 
product or events you sponsor - anywhere - until you sort this out. 
Disgraceful!'
