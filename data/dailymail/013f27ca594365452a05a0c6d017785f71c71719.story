An inconsolable mother has told of her heartbreak after an American soldier died before a helicopter could get him to hospital in Afghanistan.

It took a medical evacuation team 59 minutes to get U.S. Army Specialist Chazray Clark to a hospital, after receiving a call that a roadside bombing had severed three of his limbs.

The rescue helicopter was unable to swoop in for the pickup until another armed chopper arrived to provide cover.

Fallen hero: Specialist Chazray Clark was killed by injuries from a roadside bomb in Afghanistan

Clark’s death last September has spurred debate about whether the medevac should have been equipped with firepower and left his mother facing painful questions.

'He was alive, he was conscious and now I have the question of if they have got to him in less time would he be here?', Keyko Davis-Clark said.

‘It has devastated us all that this young man who happens to be my son was alive and conscious. Everybody was solely on he was going to make it.'

The rescue of the 1st Heavy Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division soldier, filmed by an embedded journalist Michael Yon, during which the soldier is writhing in pain, shows war at its most agonising.

After the explosion, Clark's fellow soldiers applied tourniquets to stop his bleeding. They were hopeful that he might survive even though both of his legs and most of his left arm were severed in the blast.

'I need something, please. It hurts,' Clark, a 24-year-old combat engineer from Detroit, can be heard saying on the tape.

The pre-dawn pickup zone in the Zhari
district of Kandahar province was considered 'hot,' meaning the medevac
could not swoop in for the pickup until another chopper with firepower 
arrived to provide cover.

Heartbreak: Wife Christina and her nine-year old son, Clark's stepson have to live with the knowledge that Chazray may have lived if he'd got to hospital faster

There was a delay but after
concluding that no armed escort helicopters already in the air could be
dispatched to the rescue, the Army summoned an armed Apache AH-64 
helicopter, parked at Kandahar Air Field, to the scene along with the 
medevac. The medevac crew loaded Clark aboard in two minutes and whisked
him to the hospital.

The
Army's goal is to get the most critically injured troops, or Category A
patients, to a medical facility within 60 minutes. Clark reached the hospital one minute 
within the goal.

Last year 167 Category A missions took longer than 60 
minutes, nine of them because the medevac was waiting for an air weapons
team, the army said. None of these delays affected the outcome for the patient, 
according to the Army.

Helicopters fly in pairs in 
Afghanistan. If both were armed, critics point out,  wouldn't be needed 
and both could evacuate patients from the battlefield.

Ms. Clark is convinced that her son, who leaves a wife and stepson, would still be alive had he gotten there sooner.

She
said: 'I feel like they should be armed. They're in war. Why aren't 
they armed? These young men and women are risking their lives,'

'He might be an amputee with three prosthetic limbs, but he would be here.'

Saving lives: Medivac helicopters are currently unarmed and need to be escorted when in 'hot' areas

Among her questions: If the landing zone was in such a hot zone, why wasn't there already an armed helicopter providing air support for the soldiers on the ground?

'On the video, it didn't seem like there was fighting going on,' she said.

Pilots, crew and medics who fly Afghanistan in 78 medevacs have a sole mission of recovering the wounded. Add guns to their helicopters and they would become a fighting aircraft too, says the Army, which reviewed the issue in 2008 and decided to keep the medevacs unarmed.

The Army says armed escorts are mandatory for hot pickup zones. The requirement for an armed escort when militants are merely in the area is based on a risk assessment by aviation commanders and troops on the ground.

Army officials say that waiting for 
an escort is rare, and that installing machine guns, ammunition and 
soldiers to man them would add roughly 600 pounds to a medevac chopper. 
That extra weight would limit its ability to fly in some high-altitude 
areas of Afghanistan and reduce the number of patients who could be 
evacuated at a time.

'They
try to lighten the aircraft as much as they can. They take seats out. 
They do all kinds of stuff,' said Maj. Gen. Richard Thomas, surgeon 
general of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. 'Weight is their enemy. They need
to get lift and you need to get speed.'

Unlike
the Army medevacs, which are emblazoned with red crosses, the Air 
Force, Special Operations Command and the British fly search-and-rescue 
and medevac missions with armed aircraft. They do not have red crosses, 
which can be displayed only on unarmed aircraft, according to the Geneva
Conventions.

Action: About 20 U.S. lawmakers have written to military officials inquiring about Clark's death

U.S. military officials also say that door guns can't match the precision firepower unleashed by Apache helicopters, which often escort medevacs. Limiting collateral damage is critical in Afghanistan where the death of civilians and destruction of property has put the U.S.-led coalition force at odds with the Afghan people.

'I just don't see the precision fire capability that this fight really requires, especially when you've got aircraft around that are specifically designed with Hellfire missiles, .30mm cannons with laser range finding,' said Col. T.J. Jamison of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, who commands the 82nd Combat Aviation Brigade based at Bagram. 'You're not going to get that out of any door gun on the side of an aircraft.'

Critics of the policy, including Yon, say the Army's arguments for keeping medevacs unarmed are flawed.

A medevac helicopter pilot flying in Afghanistan, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared repercussions from his superiors, challenged the Army's belief that weighing down medevacs with guns would result in fewer wounded troops being evacuated.

The issue is not how many patients can fit in a helicopter, but how many patients the single medic aboard can treat at a time — and that is one, the pilot said.

He said waiting a long time for an escort is not common — but one time is one too many.

In Clark's case, had the medevac been armed, it could have had Clark airborne and flying to a hospital within 12 minutes of his unit calling for a medevac, Yon said.

Also, armed HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters equipped with door guns that were parked in Kandahar at the time could have picked up Clark and delivered him to a hospital in fewer than 35 minutes, he said. These helicopters often assist with medevac missions, but their primary mission is for personnel rescue and recovery.

About 20 U.S. lawmakers have written to military officials inquiring Clark's death.

In a February 7 letter to a lawmaker, U.S. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. Central Command, which oversees Afghanistan, would be directed to review guidelines on the use of escort aircraft.

The Army boasts that a service member wounded in Afghanistan currently stands a 92 percent chance of surviving — the best rate of any war.Clark was among the 8 percent who didn't.
