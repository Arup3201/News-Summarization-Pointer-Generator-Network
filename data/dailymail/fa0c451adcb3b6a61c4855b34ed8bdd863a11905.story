Juventus’ team doctor has confirmed that Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal will be fit for the World Cup despite undergoing surgery just five weeks before his country’s first match of the tournament.

Vidal underwent surgery on his right knee days after his club Juventus had mathematically secured the Italian league title.

On Saturday, club doctor Fabrizio Tencone said 'He will be available for the World Cup. Arturo left Turin with his knee in the best possible condition after the operation. Now the Chile medical staff will evaluate him.'

Tencone also dismissed reports that Vidal’s World Cup is at risk because Juventus put off the operation.

He added: 'There was no delay: it would have been a medical error to operate before, it was right to try and manage it non-surgically at the beginning.'

Vidal has been instrumental in helping 
Juventus to three successive Serie A titles since arriving from Bayer 
Leverkusen in 2011.

He was struggling with problems in his right knee 
for more than a month, but continued to play for Juventus until his 
injury worsened during the second leg of the Europa League semifinal 
against Benfica last Thursday.

The 26-year-old appeared confident that the surgery would be a success after tweeting from hospital - where he was visited by Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez - 'The surgery went very well. Now, I'll give it my best to join my 
team-mates in Brazil! Go Chile!'
