GP surgeries will be given Ofsted style ratings and the worst will be shut down.

The care watchdog will start inspecting all 8,000 practices this October and grading them 'outstanding', 'good', 'requires improvement' or 'inadequate.'

Those rated inadequate will be placed in special measures if they fail to improve within six months – or in the worst cases, immediately.

This will mean they will be put under close supervision by the Care Quality Commission watchdog and NHS officials and given a series of targets.

If they fail to meet these targets and are deemed to be providing unsafe care, they will be closed down.

This is the first national inspection of GP surgeries and the CQC says it cannot say how many could be put in special measures.

But pilot checks on 900 practices last year by the watchdog found that 1 in 3 were failing to meet basic standards in one area of care.

It included two which were infected with maggots and nine where standards were so poor they could affect thousands of patients.

If the CQC's inspectors uncover concerns about a particular GP they will be referred to the General Medical Council who could decide to strike them off or suspend them.

Professor Steve Field, a senior GP and Chief Inspector of General Practice at the CQC said; 'Most GP practices provide good care.

'We have confirmed this in our pilot inspections so far. But we can't allow those that provide poor care to continue to let their patients have an inadequate service.

'I want to do all I can to drive up standards in those that are not providing the services people deserve.

'We need to have a clear framework and a process to respond to those GP practices that are providing inadequate care to ensure that they can't continue to provide inadequate care indefinitely.

'Special measures will firstly promote improvement, but where practices do not improve, working with NHS England we will call time on poor care.

'Special measures will be viewed as the final chance for a practice to improve.'

In December the CQC published findings of its pilot inspections of 900 practices which showed 300 were failing in at least one standard.

They included patients being given out-of-date medicines or injections, and nurses not trained in basic first aid.

In ten cases the failings were so severe they could potentially affect thousands of patients, the CQC warned at the time.

But the GP's union the British Medical Association warned that the tough new inspections could create a blame culture.

Dr Chaand Nagpaul, Chair of the BMA's GP committee, said: 'GPs care passionately about their patients, and it is only right that they should receive the best standards of care regardless of the GP practice they are registered with.

'However, it is important not to create a counterproductive blame culture based on isolated examples that would wrongly damage patient trust in wider GP services.'

Niall Dickson, chief executive of the General Medical Council, said: 'Whenever CQC's new inspection system raises concerns about the competency of individual GPs, the matter will be referred to the GP's local Responsible Officer and if necessary to the GMC.

'Family doctors are now subject to regular checks, but the inspections in England are bound to expose areas of weakness as well as good practice.

'We will work closely with CQC and local Responsible Officers to help drive up standards.'

Mike Bewick, Deputy Medical Director for NHS England, the body overseeing the running of the NHS said: 'Our vision is to see general practice play an even stronger role in the heart of local communities, offering more joined up, high quality services. As part of this, we want to help GPs to provide ever higher standards of care to patients.'
