The girlfriend of Dean Gaffney, Sarah Burge, had to wait three hours to discover the fate of the former EastEnders actor following his crash on Wednesday evening. 

Sarah was told by hospital staff that the 34-year-old had suffered ‘serious head injuries’ and she was encouraged to get to the hospital as soon she could. 

According to The Sun Sarah then had to travel three hours from Surrey to the hospital in Derby, with no clue what state the father of her two daughters would be in.

Upset: Sarah Burge, who is the mother of Dean's twins had to wait three hours to find out how he was

A source told the newspaper: ‘She had no idea what she would find when she finally arrived.’

On Friday evening Dean was reported as being ‘stable’ and had regained consciousness, however he was still on a drip and receiving morphine for his pain. 

His state meant he was unable to talk to Sarah or his parents, who have remained by his bed since the injury occurred. 

The Sun reports that the couple’s 16-year-old twins Chloe and Charlotte are being looking after at home by Sarah’s parents.

The source continued:  ‘Dean had a serious wound reaching from his eyebrow all the way across the top of his skull. Luckily there was no brain damage. 

‘His surgeons say only time will tell if there has been any long-term damage in the area, but at the moment the signs are good.’

The former soap star underwent 'major surgery' on his skull after being rushed to hospital following the car smash on Wednesday in Derby.

The 34-year-old, best known for playing hapless street cleaner Robbie Jackson in EastEnders for a decade, was driving home after performing in the Agatha Christie thriller A Murder Is Announced at Derby Theatre.

Father-of-two Gaffney crashed into the central reservation while driving along the A38, and was rushed to hospital in a  critical condition before being stabilised.

A spokesperson for Derbyshire
Police said: 'We can confirm that a 34-year-old man was involved in a 
collision on the A38 at around 10.45pm last night.

'There was just one car involved that hit the central reservation. He
was taken to Royal Derby Hospital where he received treatment for head 
injuries but those injuries aren't thought to be life-threatening.'

Twitter and Facebook were awash with prayers for the actor with many users speculating on his condition.

A friend of the actor told The Sun: 'He was driving home from the theatre and the next thing he knows he’s slammed into something.

'The airbags went off but Dean got a serious smash on his head. He passed out and there was a lot of blood. The car was so folded up he had to be cut out by firefighters.'

Manager Dave Read told MailOnline:'He's got some nasty head injuries but the good news is that he's going to be okay.  It was a bad crash and we're grateful it wasn't any worse.'

Mr Read did not reveal where the crash happened or if anyone else was injured.

A source close to the actor told The Mirror: 'He was very lucky to get out of the car alive. It was a really bad crash. He has a nasty head injury and lots of cuts and bruises, but he’s OK.

'He is talking in bed although is still very groggy and we’re not sure how long he will be in hospital for.'

On Thursday night, the actor reportedly underwent major surgery on his skull, although his condition is still not thought to be 'life-threatening'.

Days before the crash, Dean's co-star and former Hollyoaks star Gemma Bissix tweeted a picture of the pair posing in the snow in Buxton, Derbys.

Spokeswoman Heidi McKenzie said: 'We regretfully announce that Dean Gaffney, who is currently appearing in A Murder is Announced at Derby Theatre, has been involved in a serious car accident.

'He is currently being treated in hospital and we are awaiting more news on his condition.

Having spoken with the rest of the cast, the company and theatre have decided to go ahead with the remaining performances.

Dean recently hit headlines when it was revealed he applied for a job at M15 as a spy.

He told The Sun: 'I love spy films and the whole James Bond thing and I've got an inquiring mind, so I thought I'd give it a go.

'MI5 put out an advert looking for people and I thought "How hard can it be?". Most spies spend their lives pretending to be people who they're not. I do that for a living.'

Adam Woodyatt, who plays Ian Beale in the soap, joked that Gaffney would 'get some stick' over his application.
