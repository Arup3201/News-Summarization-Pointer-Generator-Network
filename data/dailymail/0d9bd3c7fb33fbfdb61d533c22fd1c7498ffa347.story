Actress Nicole Kidman has been braving public appearances in the wake of losing her father Dr Anthony Kidman - but has revealed it's her country music star husband Keith Urban who has helped her cope.

'I think as anyone knows, you need a partner who is there for you through the tough times, as well as the good times,' says 47-year-old Kidman.

'I think when it's really, really tough and things get hard - and recently, I lost my father - and my husband was extraordinary through that.

Nicole Kidman has  revealed she has been able to cope with her loss of her father by turning to the person she spent 'a long time looking for' – country music star husband Keith Urban (pictured)

'So I'm very, very fortunate. But I spent a long time looking for him.'

Kidman’s father Dr Antony Kidman passed away aged 75 in Singapore in September but the Oscar-winning actress has kept up her engagements despite the dark moments that have followed, retreating as often as possible to the Nashville home she shares with Urban and their children.

'I have a very quiet life there with my children and my husband and I love to go running, I love swimming. I love sport. I play golf,' said Kidman. 

'I've had a long career now and I know what's important.'

Kidman has this week travelled to the southern Chinese holiday island of Hainan to take part in the Mission Hills Celebrity Pro-Am and she has found comfort here among her own kind, being joined by fellow Hollywood A-listers Morgan Freeman, Jessica Alba and Chris Evans and even turning to fellow Aussie Greg Norman for advice about life on and off the course.

Kidman arrived in China looking refreshed and was spotted out with Norman in the early hours of Friday working on the The Before I Go To Sleep star’s swing and enjoying deep conversations with the man known as The Great White Shark - who gave the actress’ game a 'six out of 10.'

'I gave her a six only because she's just starting to learn how to play the game,” said the 59-year-old Norman.

'We as players know how to play so actually when you see somebody who wants to play and learn the game of golf, we like that. That's why I give her a six because she's going to be very, very good.

'She actually made a statement and said, "I would like to be able to play within 10 years well enough to go out and hold my own with somebody I wanted to play with on a golf course."

'I said: "If you do a few certain things at a regular time each week, within a year, you'll be able to get out there and hold your own against somebody."

'Now that tells you a lot of things about her passion, her skill, right? She's mentally ready to take it on. So it was a pleasure to spend an hour and a half working with her today.'

Kidman has been drawn to partner English Ryder Cup star Ian Poulter for the Mission Hills Celebrity Pro-Am, which starts Saturday.
