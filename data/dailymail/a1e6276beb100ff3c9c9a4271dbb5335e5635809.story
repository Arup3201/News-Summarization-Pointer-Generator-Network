Former Obama administration Pentagon chief Leon Panetta said Sunday that the president overruled nearly his entire national security team and decided not to arm moderate Syrian rebel groups early on, a decision that helped the ISIS terror army gain power.

Panetta also said he favored leaving a residual force of U.S. troops behind in Iraq instead of withdrawing them, another opinion Obama ignored.

Panetta, who was Obama's CIA director for two years before leading the Pentagon for two more, told CBS News that entering the Syria conflict earlier, and ensuring that moderate groups gained power instead of the most extreme jihadi elements, could have prevented ISIS from growing and prospering.

'I think that would've helped,' Panetta said. 'And I think, in part, we pay the price for not doing that in what we see happening with ISIS.'

And a less complete troop pullout in Iraq 'would've given us greater leverage over Iraq's government,' he emphasized.

Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta was also previously the CIA director under Obama, and served as Bill Clinton's White House chief of staff

Nearly Obama's entire national security team recommended arming moderate Syrian rebel groups who opposed dictator Bashar al-Assad

Obama now stands widely accused of standing by while ISIS, the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, established a base of operations in eastern Syria and threatened to overthrow Assad, while simultaneously marching across more than half of Iraq. 

His $500 million 'train and equip' mission there, critics say, is too late to do more than temporarily contain the group.

Panetta writes in his forthcoming memoir 'Worthy Fights' that he urged Obama in a 2012 meeting to arm Assad's less-rabid foes – and that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, then-CIA director David Petraeus and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey all agreed.

Clinton, now a presumptive Democratic presidential front-runner, said in an August interview that it was an Obama 'failure' to leave Syria's rebels to fend for themselves, a decision that 'left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled.'

Speaking to CNN, former President Bill Clinton said Sunday that he also agreed with his wife at the time.

Obama Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said in a statement last month that in 2012 the president 'wanted to make sure that we were providing assistance to people who we knew, so that it wouldn't fall into the wrong hands given how many extremists were operating in that area,'

Bill Clinton disagreed.

The revelations come from Panetta's memoir which is due out on October 7

'Since ISIS has plenty of money – it's one of the great bank robbers in human history, among other things – they were going to get their weapons one way or the other,' he said, 'so I would have risked it.'

'And besides, when we were talking about doing it, there was no ISIS. However, it was an argument she lost within the administration.'

Panetta said Sunday that 'it's going to take a long time' to defeat a defiant and strengthened ISIS, 'and I think the American people need to know it's going to take a long time.'

The group is 'as dangerous, as fanatical as terrorists as al-Qaeda was,' he said. 'And they have a large number of foreign fighters with foreign passports that make them particularly dangerous to the safety of this country.'
