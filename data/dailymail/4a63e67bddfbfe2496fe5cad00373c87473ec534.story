Safaris are famed for offering the chance to get up-close with the world's most amazing wildlife.

But one couple had a closer brush with nature than intended, after they returned to their hotel room to find a giraffe drinking from their pool.

Kali Sakai and her husband had booked a room for two at the Kariega Game Reserve in South Africa and made the discovery after returning from breakfast to find the unannounced guest making use of their facilities.

Caught in the act: The couple returned back to their hotel room after breakfast to find the giraffe happily drinking from the pool

Quick drink: The couple were staying at the Kariega Game Reserve in South Africa when they experienced the 'exhilarating encounter'

Awkward moment: The giraffe seemed a little startled when Kali used her camera to snap some pictures

Kali, 40, said: 'When I looked out the window, my brain tried to makes sense of what I was seeing but it didn't quite compute initially. It just didn't seem real or even possible.'

The giraffe had managed to discover a private plunge pool raised off the ground and protected by foliage and decided it would serve as a good watering hole. 

Kali said: 'It was exhilarating. Even though I crawled to the window and was below the window line, when I stuck the camera up on the windowsill, the giraffe was a little startled. But it held its ground.

'I peeked over and flashed a giant smile in hopes of reassuring it. It kept sticking its tongue out as it studied me. It was hilarious.

'Clearly it thought there was no danger as it bent back down and continued to drink.

Time to go: After drinking all it needed from the room's plunge pool, the giraffe trundled off back into the wildnerness

Final goodbye: The giraffe didn't disappear without a last turn back in which it appears to stick out its tongue

'Our ranger later told us that they have seen this giraffe before in the chalet area.

'For some reason this giraffe is very bold, curious and thirsty. I don't think they chlorinate the water in the winter since it's way too cold to use.

'So by all accounts the water is really clean and the giraffe only has to dip his neck half as far since the pool is embedded in the deck.'
