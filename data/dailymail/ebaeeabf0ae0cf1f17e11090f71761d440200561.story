Hacked: Tony Blair is believed to have been targeted by a 17-year-old heading a group called TeamPoison

A teenage boy is accused of heading a group of hackers who targeted Tony Blair, MI5 and the BNP.

TeamPoison claimed responsibility for hacking Scotland Yard’s anti-terrorist hotline and posted recordings on YouTube.

The 17-year-old was arrested on Friday and police seized all of his computer equipment. He was released on bail over the weekend.

He is also accused of hacking Nato and Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg.

The teenager, from Newcastle, was back at his parents' £150,000 home yesterday. He answered the door to a reporter yesterday and began talking before a woman told him to 'shut the door', the Daily Mirror reported.

The teenager was held under the Computer Misuse Act.

TeamPoison has claimed responsibility for more than 1,400 offences - including 'denial of service' attacks.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'Computer equipment has been seized and is undergoing a detailed forensic examination.'

The arrest comes after TeamPoison claimed it was 'easy' to bypass Scotland Yard's security which they said was 'from the 80s'.

They claim to have accessed a server from Malaysia to record conversations. The force launched an investigation after being made aware that the phone calls may have been hacked.

Scotland
Yard's hotline is understood to have been hit with more than 700 calls 
before an American-sounding caller, using the name Trick, told them they
were being 'pranked'.

Detectives said 'appropriate action would be taken' after a number of recordings were posted on YouTube.

In one of the clips, a man identifying himself as Trick is heard telling an officer: 'Knowledge is power... We embarrass governments and f*** the police.'

'Trick' is later heard laughing when a
woman comes on to the line to tell him that the phone call was being 
passed on to the FBI.

The hackers overwhelmed a computer server used to host sensitive phone calls using a simple computer script to infiltrate the system.

The 'Asterisk' phone server was controlled for 24 hours by the anarchist group, TeamPoison.

Hacking phone networks - known as 'phreaking', a term which was in use before computer hacking even existed - allows malicious hackers to listen in or send messages to phone users on computerised exchanges.

'Phreaking' was a predecessor to today's hacking - Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was a 'phreaker' himself in the early Seventies.

Nowadays, computerised phone systems mean that hackers can use computer-hacking skills to 'get inside' phone systems and eavesdrop on calls.

In another recording, officers appear to be discussing counter-terror operations while TeamPoison listens in.

The group claimed to have then made 
calls to MI6 - but it is understood they were in fact picked up by the 
Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism command.

Trick said the group bypassed outdated technology and used a server from Malaysia to record conversations.

A statement from Trick read: 'The phone denial of service was done via a custom script for Asterisk which was installed on an overseas server.

'The conversation was tapped into via a private phreaking method, their phone system is old and we found a way to get in via basic but private phreaking technique.'

TeamPoison said it deluged counter-terrorism officers with phone calls for 24 hours, ensuring no other calls could get through.

The
group claimed its attacks were prompted by a recent decision made by 
the European Court of Human Rights, which allowed UK-linked terror 
suspects Babar Ahmad and Adel Abdel to be extradited to America.    

By
targeting the phones, the group essentially carried out the telephonic 
equivalent of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack - an approach often used 
by online hackers against Government websites.

Another recording released by the hacktivists allegedly features MI6 staff discussing the group's attack.

Hacked: Scotland Yard launched an investigation after discovering that confidential calls to its anti-terrorist hotline were allegedly recorded by hackers

Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist 
hotline was set up in 1991 to encourage the public to report possible 
terrorist activity, and has been the subject of several costly newspaper
and radio advertising campaigns. 

A section of the Metropolitan Police's website dedicated to the hotline gives the following advice to users:

'We
want you to look out for the unusual – some activity or behaviour which
strikes you as not quite right and out of place in your normal day to 
day lives.

'You may 
feel it’s probably nothing, but unless you trust your instincts and tell
us we won’t be able to judge whether the information you have is 
important or not.

'Remember, no piece of information is considered too small or insignificant.

'Our
specially trained officers would rather take lots of calls which are 
made in good faith, but have innocent explanations – rather than not 
getting any at all.'

Addressing
concerns about secrecy, it goes on, 'We know you may have concerns 
about speaking to the police – possibly because your friends or family 
may find out.

'But all 
information passed to the police is treated in the strictest of 
confidence. It is thoroughly analysed and researched by experienced 
officers before, and if, any police action is taken.'
