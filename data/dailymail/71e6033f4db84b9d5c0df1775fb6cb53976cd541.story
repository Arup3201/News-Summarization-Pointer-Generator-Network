Monisha Kaltenborn has no intention of quitting as team principal of Sauber despite being mired in legal controversy this week.

Kaltenborn's position has been drawn into sharp focus after appearing to have signed three drivers for the new Formula One season, but with naturally only two seats available.

The case with reserve driver Giedo van der Garde is to continue at the Supreme Court of Victoria in Melbourne on Saturday, just a few miles from the Albert Park circuit.

Kaltenborn, a trained lawyer, was naturally unable to shed any light on the case given it remains ongoing.

But asked whether she was still competent to run the team, Kaltenborn replied: 'I don't see it (the case) having any effect.

'We have a very clear view of what we did. We took action after thinking about it for a while.

'For us that was very clear, but the outcome is different, and that's all I can say to you.'

Pressed on whether she had considered resigning, Kaltenborn added: 'I've not considered that.

'This whole matter does not have any effect on the way we work, the way the team works.'

Kaltenborn conceded, however, the past week had affected morale with the team's name dragged through the courts.

'It's had a very negative impact on the team because the situation was, for a while, unclear,' added Kaltenborn.

'We now have certain actions taken against the team, and we are acting accordingly. There's nothing much more really I can say to that.'

The Supreme Court initially upheld a Swiss arbitration panel decision that the team not deny Van der Garde his right to drive given the 29-year-old has a contract for a full-time seat for this season.

Swedish driver Marcus Ericsson was also in action for Sauber under the blazing sun in Melbourne 

Van der Garde is now pursuing enforcement of the order allowing him to drive, otherwise Sauber risk being in contempt of court.

At one stage during the day bailiffs were on stand-by outside the circuit ready to impound Sauber's assets, namely the cars and trackside equipment.

Sauber's problem is they also signed Marcus Ericcson and Felipe Nasr towards the end of last year before cancelling Van der Garde's deal in February, according to Kaltenborn.

With three valid contracts and only two race seats available, Sauber and Kaltenborn have found themselves mired in controversy

Sauber have been forced to detail their assets to the court, whilst the worst-case scenario for Kaltenborn is she faces imprisonment if she fails to comply with the order.

The legal argument resulted in Sauber failing to take to the track for the opening practice session of the year at Melbourne's Albert Park.

Come FP2, with lawyers for both parties back in court at the same time, it was Ericsson and Nasr behind the wheel, with Van der Garde unable to acquire in time a super licence required to drive in F1.

Asked as to why they were unable to take part in FP1 yet did so in FP2, she replied: 'It's a topic which I cannot talk about. That's all I can say.'

In court, Justice Croft ordered a further recess until 9.30am local time Saturday (10.30pm UK), with constructive talks understood to have taken place, leading to the possibility of a conclusion.
