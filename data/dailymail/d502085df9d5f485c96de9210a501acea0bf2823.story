Prime Minister David Cameron is under pressure to deliver on his pledge to claw powers back from Brussels

Britain’s opposition to draconian Brussels’ measures has been over-ruled by the EU on every occasion since records began.

Official figures show that the British government has failed to stop 55 new laws being introduced by the European Council since 1996.

Experts said it was evidence that Britain had little influence in Europe and over other member states.

Matthew Elliott, CEO of the pressure group Business for Britain, said: ‘It is clear that Britain’s influence in Europe is not as high as many would have us believe.

'With the EU regularly acting against the UK’s national interest, the Government must push for proper safeguards in the forthcoming renegotiation.’

EU legislation that Britain has tried to block includes restrictions on car emissions which the UK government warned would cost the UK up to £56 billion and the draft 2013 EU budget which the Treasury said would cost the UK £8.6 bn.

The UK’s voting power in the Council of Ministers has decreased from 17 per cent to 8 per cent since 1973, when it first joined the European community.

In the European Parliament, it has also more than halved from 20 per cent to 9.5 per cent and in the European Commission it plummeted from 15 per cent to 4 per cent.

The figures for how objections have been ignored - obtained under freedom of information requests - came just days after polling by Lord Ashcroft, the former Tory party treasurer, revealed that 72 per cent of Britons had no confidence in the country’s ability to secure a better deal from Brussels.

Britain has voted ‘no’ on 55 separate occasions since 1996 - but on every occasion, that legislation was passed by the Council.

Business for Britain called for a ‘red card system’ - backed by many Conservative MPs - that would allow national parliaments to join together and veto new European laws.

The group also backed Chancellor George Osborne’s push for two separate votes to take place - one for Eurozone members and one of non-Eurozone countries. Both groups would have to vote in favour of a measure for it to be adopted.

Critics pointed out that the EU was increasingly operating on Qualified Majority Voting rather than unanimity.

This removes Britain’s ability to veto laws that are against its national interest.

But a spokesman for the Foreign Secretary disputed the methodology used by Business for Britain, pointing out votes against were usually only recorded when a vote was likely to be pushed through.

He said: ‘This report is not accurate. The Council of Ministers usually only vote when there is a qualified majority in favour so, by definition, if the UK is opposed on an issue that goes to a vote we are going to lose.’

The spokesman added: ‘The report doesn’t look at the countless times we have worked with allies behind the scenes to block proposals that are not in British interests, or to negotiate changes to turn them to our advantage.

‘From the first ever cut to the EU’s budget to getting Britain out of Eurozone bail outs to fundamental reform of the disastrous Fisheries Policy to protections in Banking Union, this Government is succeeding in bringing real change to the EU.’

He added that the UK had successfully blocked the establishment of an operational military HQ for a European military in 2011 but this had not been recorded by the study.
