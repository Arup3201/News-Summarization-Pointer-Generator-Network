This is the horrifying moment a man found a dead mouse inside a sausage he had used to make himself a sandwich.

Anatol Voronkov, 28, had already munched his way through half the 'high quality meat product' when he spotted something dark lurking inside.

He realised it was a mouse or young rat and then showed his wife who was physically sick.

Anatol Voronkov, 28, from Russia found a mouse inside sausage meat he had used to make a sandwich

'I thought it was a pepper, but then I realised it was the foot of a rodent. And worse, I then found the foot was attached to the rest of the animal in the middle of the sausage,' said Mr Voronkov.

'I felt really sick but the only good thing was that I was the only one who ate it, and my wife and kids hadn't touched it. And although I felt sick, when I showed my wife she really was sick.'

He complained to the environmental health officials and said the factory which made the product should be closed down.

'I didn't want compensation, I want an inspection at the factory and I think it should be closed down if it's standards are as poor as I suspect,' said Mr Voronkov.

Mr Voronkov has called for an inspection of the Russian factory which made the product and believes it should be closed down if standards are not being met 

'I bought the sausage from a good store because they promise a high-quality meat product.'

The discovery has put him off sausages for life and his wife is now becoming a vegetarian.

Tatiana Kuzmina, a spokeswoman for the supermarket that sold the sausage in the Russian city of Irkutsk said they had never had a similar problem and instantly refunded the full price of the sausage to the customer.

She said: 'We have also contacted the factory and demanded an explanation.'

The rodent has been sent for tests to see if it is carrying any diseases.
