The parents of a teenager who died in hospital four days after he took a legal high imported from Holland, have described him as 'a normal young man who loved music and football.'

Adam Hunt was discovered collapsed in his bedroom by his mother Bernadette, and he told her that he had taken Alpha Methyltryptamine, or AMT, which he had ordered from the Netherlands.

The 18-year-old is also believed to have taken etizolam, which is also a psychoactive substance.

She immediately called for an ambulance and the Adam, from Southampton, Hampshire, was rushed to hospital.

Doctors treating him said that his condition was 'life-threatening' after he was admitted to Southampton General Hospital on Wednesday last week.

Adam was put in a medically-induced coma and on Sunday - four days after taking the drugs - he died.

He was described as a 'much loved son' whose interests ranged from football and music to clothes and girls.

'He loved football and was a Saints season ticket holder. His musical tastes were eclectic ranging from Oasis to drum 'n' bass,' his mother and father, Darren, said.

'He did well at school and just two years ago he left with 11 GCSE A-C passes and had gone on to study electrical engineering at college in an attempt to follow in his dad's footsteps.

'He loved travel as well and was due to go on holiday in the next few weeks with one of his best friends to New York where he had planned an itinerary of sight seeing and restaurant visiting as he was also very keen on food.

'He was very thoughtful and caring and loved his family and friends dearly. One of the things we will always remember though about him was his fantastic sense of humour. It is very hard to think we will not get to laugh or talk with him anymore.

The 18-year-old was placed in an

legal high he bought online

'His life had such potential and was all in front of him, sadly it has been cut prematurely very short.'

A police spokesman said that the exact cause of Adam's death is yet to be established.

Officers are preparing a report for the Hampshire Coroner on his death.

Originally developed as an anti-depressant, AMT is a psychedelic drug which releases serotonin and can have effects similar to LSD and ecstasy.

However, it can have side effects such as nausea and anxiety. Since June 2012 two deaths in Hampshire have been attributed to AMT, including trainee doctor Doug Ferguson, aged 19 years, from Chandler's Ford and a 33-year-old Andover man.

Detective Constable Jonathan Hyland, of Hampshire police, warned: 'The clear issue is that people who state they have a strong view about not taking controlled drugs are importing and purchasing drugs which they read online are a substitute for controlled drugs.

'People incorrectly believe that these 'legal highs' are then both safe and appropriate alternatives to street drugs.

'Just because something is not illegal does not make it safe.

'It only becomes clear it is not safe when someone becomes severely harmed by taking it and subsequent investigations reveal substances within the compound can be lethal.

'If you are considering taking any type of non personally prescribed drug, I would urge you to consider for a few minutes - before you use the substance - how your family would feel, finding you in need of critical medical attention.'

An MP today called for the Government to spearhead a European bid to prosecute businesses selling deadly 'legal highs' following the deaths of three men in just a year.

Southampton Itchen MP and former Home Office minister John Denham wants a united legal attempt to prosecute anyone selling such drugs across Europe.

Mr Denham said: 'I would suggest to the Government that we need a concerted attempt to use every legal move we can to bring these people down if they can be identified as selling these drugs.

'We need to take the profit out of it and throw the book at people.

'Only part of the answer is regulation and there does need to be more education.

'The very phrase 'legal high' is dangerous because it gives the impression that it must be OK - otherwise it would be banned.'
