A man arrested in Florida has been charged with a 2012 murder that happened in New York.

Boyd Holland, 22, of Copaigue, New York, was picked up in Orlando, Florida, Tuesday and  charged with second-degree murder in the death of Eric Brooks.

A giant tattoo across Holland's neck that says Savage no doubt helped authorities identify him.

Brooks was 35-years-old when he died on May 12, 2012, from a gunshot wound.

CBS New York reports that Suffolk County police were called out around 11:35 p.m. on that night after a caller reported a man had been shot in the torso, finding Brooks lying in the rear of a yard in Wyandanch, New York.

He was pronounced dead at Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center in West Islip.

Authorities have not yet revealed how they connected Holland to Brooks' death.
