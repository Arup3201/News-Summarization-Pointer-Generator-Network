Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will bring back the practice of writing the names of the responsible doctor and nurse above every bed so families know 'where the buck stops'

Eight patients die needlessly every day because of a ‘silent scandal’ of NHS errors, the Health Secretary said today.

Jeremy Hunt will bring back the practice of writing the names of the responsible doctor and nurse above every bed so families know ‘where the buck stops’.

The NHS should also publish better safety information, such as the likelihood of emerging unscathed from each hospital across the country, he said.

In a speech at University College 
Hospital, London, arranged before the scandal of watchdogs hiding baby 
deaths broke, Mr Hunt said nearly 500,000 patients were harmed 
unnecessarily and 3,000 died last year.

In 2011/12, there were 326 so-called ‘never events’ – events so unacceptable they should never happen.

‘The
 ones we know about include 161 people with foreign objects left in 
their bodies, like swabs or surgical tools; 70  people suffering 
wrong-site surgery, where the wrong part of the body or even the wrong 
patient was operated on; and 41 people given incorrect implants or 
prostheses,’ Mr Hunt said.

‘Put another way – every other day we 
leave a foreign object in someone’s body, every week we operate on the 
wrong part of someone’s body, and every fortnight we insert the wrong 
implant. This is the silent scandal of our NHS.’

The NHS sees nearly three million 
people a week. About 0.4 per cent suffer harm and 0.003 per cent die – 
better rates than France, Germany, Sweden, Norway and the US.

But
 pointing to scandals in Mid Staffs and Morecambe Bay, Mr Hunt said a
 ‘grim fatalism’ blunts ‘the anger we should feel about every single 
individual we let down’.

‘We have allowed ourselves to settle for levels of patient harm that are simply unacceptable.’

Mr Hunt today visited University College Hospital HQ and Education Centre, London where Clinton John demonstrated a robotic da Vinci Surgical System

Mr Hunt called on the NHS to improve reporting of errors.

It will become the first healthcare system to publish information on the likelihood of a ‘harm-free’ experience across every hospital in the country.

The Health Secretary added: ‘The NHS fails too many times. But it also holds the keys to becoming the world’s safest health system.’

Professor Norman Williams, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said: ‘Any preventable harm is unacceptable. However rare these incidents are, never should mean never.’

Sir Richard Thompson, president of the Royal College of Physicians, added: ‘Every patient should have a named consultant responsible for their care. We welcome this call from the Health Secretary,  and we believe it will help to improve patient experience.’
