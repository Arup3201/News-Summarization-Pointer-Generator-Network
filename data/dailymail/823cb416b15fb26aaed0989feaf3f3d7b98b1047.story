The families of hostages David Haines and Alan Henning who were murdered by the Islamic extremist Jihadi John have been blessed by the Pope.

Aid worker David Haines, of Yorkshire, was beheaded last September after being captured by Islamic state. Alan Henning, 47, a father-of-two, was killed in the same way a month later. 

Both murders appeared on video and apparently showed Jihadi John, who has recently been unmasked as Mohammed Emwazi, from London, carrying out the killings.

Pope Francis met Barbara Henning right), the wife of murdered British hostage Alan Henning, and Michael Haines (centre), the brother of David Haines, at St Peter's Basilica today 

Today Pope Francis met the families of the two men at a service aimed at uniting religions and ending extremism. 

Widow Barbara Henning was brought up to meet the Pope on the steps of St Peter's Basilica in Rome after his rain-soaked general audience. Usually such access is reserved for visiting prelates.

Michael Haines, brother of David Haines, was also able to meet the Pope at the ceremony. Since the death of his brother he has dedicated himself to promoting tolerance between religions and unity against extremism. 

He said the moment 'took my breath away.' 

Alan Henning (left) was kidnapped on Boxing Day 2013 and murdered in October last year, David Haines (right), who had dedicated his life to helping others across the world was killed in September 2014 

In a telephone interview he said the pope told him he was going to pray for him to 'continue the work that we're doing on unity and tolerance and bringing our communities together.'

In October 2014, Mr Haines signed a joint letter with Mrs Henning calling for all religions to accept each other and for mosques, churches and synagogues to open their doors to all faiths.  

Mr Henning, of Salford in Manchester, kidnapped on Boxing Day 2013 as he delivered aid to Syrian refugees.

The former RAF engineer and taxi driver apparently always believed he would be freed by his captors. 

After news of his death broke his widow described him as a 'decent, caring human being.' 

David Haines travelled with aid agencies through Syria, Libya, the former Yugoslavia and South Sudan for more than two decades. 

Mrs Henning met the Pope today in a meeting aimed at tackling religious extremism and violent conflict 

Mr Haines dedicated his life to promoting peace in places of violent conflict and oversaw projects to save civilians from land mines. 

He had married his wife just three years before he was captured by ISIS gunmen on an isolated road in Syria, while working for the Technical Cooperation and Development (Acted) agency. 

He was captured when he was working for the Atmeh refugee camp, in Syria, for the French aid agency Acted.
