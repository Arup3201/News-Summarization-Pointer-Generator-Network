Hanging up from a butcher's hook, being boiled in a giant pot and bathing in tub of sweets is all in a day's work for these top chefs.

Big names Marcus Wareing, Anna Hansen, Pascal Aussignac and Ian Pengelley all posed for the striking pictures after naming their biggest culinary inspiration - and then acting it out.

The cooking stars have been photographed with their top ingredients to coincide with tickets going on sale for this summer's food festival Taste of London 2015.

Chef Anna Hansen from Modern Pantry, Clerkenwell, was shot hanging from a  hook next to pig carcasses

Masterchef star Marcus Wareing confesses his love of  tomatoes - and finds food inspiration on his travels

Anna Hansen, the chef at Clerkenwell's Modern Pantry, cites well-hung meat as her muse, specifically pork.

She said: 'For me a good piece of meat is something of beauty and a flavour that just can’t be beaten.

'The pig is a fantastic animal; incredibly tasty, versatile and the recipe options are endless.' 

On taking her position next to the meaty carcasses, the chef said, 'I feel honoured to be hanging next to such a handsome beast.' 

While, tough MasterChef judge and chef at Marcus and runs The Gilbert Scott and Tredwell's, goes further for ideas.

He said getting away from it all is key to his culinary success - along with sampling the produce he encounters.

Masterchef star Marcus Waring confesses his love of versatile and flavoursome tomatoes, explaining that he finds inspiration for new dishes while sampling ingredients on his travels

The former protege of Gordon Ramsay said: 'I am a huge fan of travelling. It helps clear my head and gives me a lot of inspiration for my restaurants and dishes.

'Tomatoes are one of my favourite as I love their versatility and flavour.' 

Usually stony-faced, the chef posed for playful pictures of a suitcase falling open and tomatoes tumbling to the floor.

In another shot, he sits on packing cases on a sea of produce, casually tossing one into the air and catching it one hand. 

What prompted Michelin-starred French chef Pascal Aussignac to climb into a bath of pink sweets? 'This year  I will be combining my two passions and creating a dessert using sweets and duck'

Michelin-starred French chef Pascal Aussignac, who was born in Toulouse but now runs Club Gascon in London's Smithfield, went for the most whimsical shoot.

Stripping off to lie in an old fashion claw-foot bath, the culinary star was then submerged in Gallic sweets Fraise Tagada - and rather than playing with a rubber duck, he was given a real, live feathered friend.

He explained: 'I love candy, and especially the French sweet Tagada.

'This year at Taste of London I will be combining my two passions and creating a dessert using sweets and duck, you will need to try it to believe it.' 

Asian chef Ian Pengelley hopped into a steaming oven pot, as he revealed he loves to add theatrical flair and experimental ingredients to all his best dishes

For chef Ian Pengelley, who  was recently named executive chef of Chinese restaurant Chai Wu by Pan Chai in Harrods, Knightsbridge, dining is all about theatre.

He posed in a huge steaming pot for the picture by acclaimed food photographer John Carey. 

With a background working at Thai restaurant Mango Tree Belgravia and consulting on Asian cuisine, he said: 'I am hugely passionate about Asian cooking.

'I love to experiment using Asian flavours and ingredients but with British flare and theatre.'
