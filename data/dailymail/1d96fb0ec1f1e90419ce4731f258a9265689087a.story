Two brothers who left their friend to die when he was electrocuted as they stole copper cable from beside a railway were behind bars tonight.

John and Jason Tusting, 26 and 23, sold the metal for just £340 within hours of father-of-two James Smith suffering a fatal shock inside an electricity substation.

The 28-year-old's body lay undiscovered for more than two hours while the emergency services carried out a search of the area.

Jason Tusting had anonymously called 999 but lied about the exact location of the incident.

The break-in caused £110,000 worth of damage, but the copper was sold for just £342 at scrap dealer GH Metals in Peckham, south-east London, Blackfriars Crown Court heard.

The brothers made the sale shortly after railway staff finally came across Smith's body in the substation near Sydenham station at around 7am on December 4 last year.

Mr Smith had suffered horrific burns and was discovered lying near a pile of bricks, naked from the waist up with his mobile phone and car keys taken from his pockets.

John Tusting had to be taken to hospital by ambulance at around 7.23am suffering from 'severe' burns on his left arm and shoulder sustained in the burglary.

He told paramedics he had been attacked overnight by three men, who had doused him with petrol and set him on fire. But he later told doctors he had been drunk and simply woke up with the injuries.

Jason Tusting, of Honor Oak, south London; and John Tusting, of Lee, also south London, pleaded guilty to burglary and criminal damage recklessly endangering life.

Jason Tusting has also admitted perverting the course of justice.

The brothers were due to be sentenced this afternoon, however, Judge John Hillen adjourned sentenced until August 12, and ordered the Probation Service to produce reports to address whether they represented a 'danger' to the public and should face indefinite jail terms.

Remanding the men in custody, he said: 'Custody is the only option, and it is really a question of what form the custody takes - one may be looking at a longer term for the protection of the public.'

The court heard Jason, giving the false name 'Josh Tusting', rang 999 at 5.32am to say he had been waiting for a train at Sydenham station and seen a 'flash of light' and a man fall to the trackside.

But the location he described was 'some distance' from the substation, the court heard.

The substation's power supply had been tripped two minutes earlier at 5.30am when the cables were cut.

Jason Tusting admitted his real identity after being tracked down by a suspicious officer, who then asked to check his hand for a distinctive scar recorded on Jason's police file.

Simon Taylor, prosecuting, said the brothers had 'tried to conceal their activities and in effect created a false crime scene, thereby delaying the discovery of the body.'

Jason's DNA was later found on Smith's lips - suggesting he had tried mouth-to-mouth resuscitation before fleeing from the scene.

The court heard Network Rail had 'experienced a 300 per cent increase in the theft of copper and other metals' since 2004, at a total cost of £15m.

Mr Taylor said: 'It is quite clear that the damage caused during the course of the commission of these economic crimes has the effect of endangering the lives of others.

'This is a feature of these crimes that was starkly and tragically demonstrated in this particular case, where one of the gang of thieves died as a consequence of being electrocuted.

'The defendants appear on the indictment not because they are directly to blame for the death but because they created a hazard that left the lives of others in danger - a risk that is only too sadly evidenced by the death of their colleague.'

The damage resulted in the closure of the main commuter line between London and Kent coast for almost an hour.

James Rouse, defending, insisted John Tusting had made attempts to save Smith, and had suffered as a result.

'He grabbed him in an effort to pull him away, thereby causing extremely serious injuries to himself,' he said.

'He was in hospital for five days straight after the incident and, when the ambulance technician arrived at his home, when asked how painful his injuries were, he said "10 out of 10".'

The illiterate thief, whose criminal record includes convictions for burgling a primary school, stealing a car and possessing a knife in public, was arrested on December 16 in the burns unit of Lewisham Hospital.

Jason Tusting's record includes criminal damage, affray, theft and drink-driving.

His barrister Nick Robinson said he had also made attempts to seek help after the break-in, calling for an ambulance and trying to administer CPR.

But Judge John Hillen said the 999 call was misleading 'causing operatives looking for the body to put themselves a risk'.
