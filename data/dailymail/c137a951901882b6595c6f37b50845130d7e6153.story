Queens Park Rangers have been given a major fillip after key midfielder Sandro returned to training. The Brazilian has been out since November 22 after sustaining a knee injury in the defeat at Newcastle.

But the former Tottenham midfielder has returned to the club’s Harlington HQ as he steps up his rehab. He plans to resume full training early next month ahead of a first-team comeback towards the end of January.

However, Rangers boss Harry Redknapp has learned that left back Yun Suk-young will miss up to six weeks with an ankle injury.

But Yun Suk-young is on the sidelines for up to six weeks after suffering an ankle injury

The defender damaged ankle ligaments in last Saturday’s 3-2 win over West Bromwich Albion.

Redknapp admits he is in the market for a new left back next month, but says QPR’s finances mean the club must rely on the loan market.

‘The injury to Yun means left back is an area we might look at,’ said the QPR manager. ‘But the club doesn’t want to get into trouble by spending money we don’t have. We have what we have so we’ll try to take a couple of loans.’

Meanwhile, Redknapp has backed Arsenal to qualify for next season’s Champions League, but only because their competitors have not been up to scratch.

Rangers travel to the Emirates Stadium  looking for a second successive victory.

And despite Arsenal’s difficulties this season, Redknapp says they will secure a top-four spot.

‘I think the other sides have not performed to their normal level,’ said the Rangers boss.

‘Tottenham are starting to pick up some points but Everton and Liverpool, who were bang there last year, this year they are not and they need to start getting it together quickly.

‘And I’m not writing West Ham off either, but I still think Arsenal and Manchester United will fill the other two spots.’
