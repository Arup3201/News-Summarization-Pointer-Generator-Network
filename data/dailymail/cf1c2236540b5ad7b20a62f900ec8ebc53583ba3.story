Use of flesh-eating krokodil is spreading across the U.S. and doctors say some victims are injecting it because they think it is heroin. 

The first cases of the drug, which is popular in Russia, were recorded in Arizona last month.

But three cases have now been reported in Chicago and doctors say two of the women did not even know they had been sold the drug.

This Russian man is suffering the side-effects of Krokodil use. Doctors say there are users of the drug in Chicago just weeks after first known cases in U.S. were reported in Arizona

This man's ankle (left) shows symptoms of gangrene and another individual's fingers are rotting away (both cases are from Russia). Doctors fear an epidemic of the cheap heroin substitute in the U.S.

The women are all aged between 18 and 25 and come from middle class backgrounds.

Doctors
have warned of the horrifying side effects of the homemade drug, which 
is said to give a more powerful high than heroin and is much cheaper to 
produce.

It is created using a mixture of codeine and gasoline or oil.

It is then filtered and injected into the user's body.

It
is called Krokodil because it leave addicts with reptilian-like skin 
and prolonged use causes gangrene and user's flesh begins to rot.

Dr
Abhin Singla said he instantly recognized the smell of rotting flesh at
Presence St Joseph Medical Center in Chicago and realized krokodil use 
had arrived in the city.

Dr
Singla, the hospital's director of addiction services, told Joliet.Patch he surprised at how quickly krokodil use had spread from 
Arizona.

He said: 'If you want to kill yourself, this is the way to do it.'

Rabid use in Russia has caused up to 2.5 million people to register and seek treatment as addicts and the average life span for a user is only two to three years.

'When drug users do it repeatedly, the skin sloughs. It causes hardening of their skin. It will cause necrosis,' explained LoVecchio.

The
doctor said two of the patients arrived at hospital asking for help to 
wean themselves off heroin, without realizing they had actually been 
injecting themselves with krokodil.

He
hopes warnings about the drug will spread through word of mouth among 
addicts and called for greater education to halt a feared epidemic.

Dr
Singla told the website: 'The goriness of the pictures of rotting arms 
and legs are hard to look at, but I think parents really need to share 
them with their kids.'

Dr. Frank LoVecchio at Banner's Poison Control Center says he believes the two cases found in Arizona to be the start of a problem in the United States

Last month, Banner's Poison Control Center in Arizona
encountered the drug when two addicts arrived in emergency rooms with 
their flesh hanging off their body, exposing bone or with skin 
resembling that of a crocodile, hence its name.

'We've
had two cases this past week that have occurred in Arizona,' said Dr. 
Frank LoVecchio, the co-medical director at Banner's Poison Control 
Center to KPHO.Com.

Krokodil's, medical name is desomorphine and is created by mixing codeine with  gasoline, paint thinner, hydrochloric acid, iodine and red phosphorous.There are reportedly nearly three million users in Russia and the epidemic began in Siberia and the Russian Far East.The drug causes flesh to rot from the inside out and the addict's skin becomes scaly, like a crocodile's, hence the name. Blood vessels burst and the surrounding tissue dies. Gangrene and amputations are a common result and sometimes bone can be exposed.The high lasts one hour and a half and the drug is three times cheaper to produce than heroin.

'As
far as I know, these are the first cases in the United States that are 
reported. So we're extremely frightened,' he continued.

LoVechhio
says that the two cases he has encountered are most likely linked and 
he declined to comment on the appearance of the two users.

'Where there is smoke there is fire, and we're afraid there are going to be more and more cases,' said LoVechhio.

Some users in Russia develop brain damage and speech impediments in addition to the horrific scars.

Krokodil, whose medical name is desomorphine, has the same mental effect as heroin but is produced with over-the-counter codeine and mixed with gasoline, paint thinner, hydrochloric acid and even the red phosphorous scraped from the tips of matches.

Prevalent in Siberia and the Russian Far East, the explosion of users began in 2002, but over the past five years in Russia, usage has trebled.

In 2011 alone, Russia's Federal Drug Control Service confiscated 65 million doses.

The flesh rotting that is specific to Krokodil occurs directly at the injection site which could be anywhere from the feet to the forehead to the more traditional arms.
