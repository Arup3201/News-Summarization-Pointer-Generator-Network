Daniel Crowley's penalty guided Arsenal into the fourth round of the FA Youth Cup following a hard-fought win over Reading on Friday night.

The 17-year-old midfielder, who signed his first professional contract with the club back in August, fired the spot-kick into the bottom corner to settle the tie on 65 minutes.

It was Crowley's ninth goal of the season and set up a match against non-league Royston Town in the next round - but only after Reading missed a stoppage-time penalty.

The young Gunners, coached by Frans de Kat, have been struggling in the league and were winless in seven games entering this fixture at Meadow Park in Boreham Wood.

But they were motivated after reaching the semi-finals of the competitions last season, only to be knocked out over two legs by eventual winners Chelsea.

Among the other talents named in the Arsenal team were Gedion Zelalem, who made his first-team debut earlier this year, and Stephy Mavididi, who scored two goals in the group stage of the UEFA Youth League.

Reading started the match the brighter, with Tennai Watson and then Noor Husin missing chances inside the opening 10 minutes.

Eventually, Arsenal began to control proceedings and Crowley forced a fine save out of Lewis Ward. Mavididi then jumped highest to head Crowley's cross against the bar.

The pressure only increased as the first-half wore on, with Zelalem sending a low drive just wide of the post and Chris Willock drawing a good stop from Ward just before the break.

The Reading stopper was called upon early in the second period to deny Crowley after the Arsenal playmaker beat two defenders to work a shooting opportunity.

Zelalem and Willock both had another chance apiece before Arsenal's intense pressure finally told. George Dobson located Willock inside the box and he was brought down by Hammed Lawal.

Crowley made no mistake from 12 yards and the hosts had the lead they deserved.

Going behind seemed to spur Reading into life and Ryan Huddart had to make a superb reaction save to keep out Jake Sheppard.

There was more drama to come, however, when Sheppard was fouled in the box during the fourth minute of stoppage time.

Extra time beckoned but Harry Cardwell blazed his penalty over the bar and Arsenal squeezed through.
