Carlo Ancelotti's Real Madrid are in a mini-crisis mode, with world stars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale struggling for form. Real fan Lucas Navarrete of managingmadrid.com writes on the team's current troubles, and why he wouldn't hesitate to drop a big name.

Carlo Ancelotti’s Real Madrid have recorded five losses, two draws and just one win in La Liga’s toughest venues since the Italian took over: Nou Camp (Barcelona), Vicente Calderon (Atletico Madrid), Mestalla (Valencia), Sanchez Pizjuan (Sevilla) and San Mames (Athletic Bilbao).

The fans remember how successful the team was during last season’s run at the Champions League and the Copa del Rey, and they also have in mind why that happened.

In those three games – the Copa del Rey final and the Champions League semi-finals —Real Madrid played with a 4-4-2 formation that allowed them to defend properly and counterattack at the earliest opportunity.

Real employed a 4-4-2  to devastating effect against Bayern Munich in last season's Champions League

The team’s attacking trio of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema did not feature together on two out of those three games, the other one being the return leg against Bayern in the Allianz Arena.

Injuries to Bale (a 1-0 win against Bayern at the Bernabeu) and Ronaldo (Copa del Rey final) forced Ancelotti to use a 4-4-2 system that proved to be so solid that the Italian coach played Gareth Bale as a midfielder on Real’s historic 4-0 win in Germany.

This season, Bale also had to miss last October’s Clasico. Ancelotti knew what he had to do, he used that same 4-4-2 formation with James and Isco on the wings, and Real Madrid were able to come back and earn a convincing 3-1 win against Messi and Co.

Considering how badly the team have struggled against Valencia and Atletico Madrid since 2015 started, it’s not surprising to see that several polls around the Spanish media prove that the fans want to see that 4-4-2 formation again.

If that happens, Ancelotti will either be forced to move one of the BBC to the bench or play Bale in a much more defensive role. That will turn Real Madrid into a less-glamorous side, but they will also be a solid team capable of beating tough opponents once and for all.

The BBC-system works and is good enough to easily dismantle most La Liga and Champions League teams. But whenever you go up against the best clubs in European football, you need to have a good defensive plan that the usual 4-3-3 formation does not provide.

Given that Ronaldo is Real Madrid's best player and that Benzema is the team's only centre forward, it would be reasonable to think that Bale would indeed be the one moving to the bench if Ancelotti decides to use this 4-4-2 formation, and that would be the right call.

The buck stops with manager Carlo Ancelotti when it comes to choosing a big name to lose from his line-up

Benzema is crucial to the team's fluidity upfront, setting up his teammates and helping the midfielders at controlling the tempo of the game, and unless Ronaldo changes his game and becomes a pure striker, the Frenchman is the only player in the roster capable of doing that.

While it would be tempting not to pay attention to the fans' whistles, having the Bernabeu fans against you is always the first step towards a move out of the club, and that's why Ancelotti should try to regain the fans' support.

The Santiago Bernabeu is a very demanding crowd and they have already affected the way Gareth Bale plays. After the whistles, the Welsh player is not attempting nearly as many shots as he was when things were working out well for him, so Ancelotti will surely use Bale's experience as a good example to change Real Madrid's shape and improve the way his team is defending.

If a £86m player needs to sit on the bench, so be it.
