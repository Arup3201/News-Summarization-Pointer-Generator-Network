After the birth of my son, through the fug of exhaustion, gas and air, I was sent off by the midwife to shower while my husband had his turn at cuddling and bonding with our scrumptious, sleepy baby boy.

In a haze of euphoria as the warm water hit, I looked down at my body. For 40 weeks, it had steadily grown around my son, nurturing him while I carried on with my life, but now the firm bump had deflated.

Here to stay: William, baby George, Kate - and her post-baby bump

Almost the same size it had been a day earlier, it was softer, less defined. Like a balloon the day after a party. In an instant, my baby bubble wobbled a little and I resolved to diet.

So, on Tuesday, when a glowing Kate presented her gorgeous son to the world, I sent up a silent cheer.

I had expected her to appear in a billowing frock, perhaps holding her son lower down across her tummy, a long shawl perhaps - anything to hide her figure. But she didn't. Her lovely mummy tummy was on full show in a belted, fitted dress.

As the former editor of Mother&Baby magazine, I spent years trying to reassure women that their babies weren't the enemy of their bodies, despite harbouring the same fears myself.

My heart would break every time I'd read the postbag from readers who were upset and angry at the pressure they felt to be super-skinny at their six-week check-up.

I still remember one reader who was devastated because her 'celebrity pregnancy twin' - the star she was at the same stage as - was model Miranda Kerr. While our reader was wiping baby sick off the man-size T-shirts she was still wearing, Miranda was off on modelling assignments.

Clearly, Miranda started off with a amazing body and has the extra motivation of being employed for her looks, but even the most normal-seeming celebs smile back at us with a washboard stomach, mere weeks after giving birth. And so we ask ourselves: 'If she can do it, why can't I?'

Post-birth, I looked as though I could have popped another one out at any time, and I had been a size 10 before. But knowing I was normal didn't make me feel any less of a lump, and the low mood I had as a result spoiled what should have been a lovely time getting to know my baby.

I was so sick of the dreaded stretch waistbands and empire-line dresses, and wouldn't let anyone go near me with a camera, always making sure I took the pictures of my beautiful boy, but was not in them myself.

The truth is that the post-birth body has become alien to us. Contrary to what some people seem to think, women aren't elastic bands. There is no snapping back - and certainly not in 24 hours!

Bumps are not just babies, neither are they simply fat stores. The womb is an amazing thing that grows with the baby, and it needs time to readjust once its role as infant transport has ended.

Most doctors tell new mums not to expect to get near their pre-baby size until nine months later - any extra pounds took that long to go on, so it makes sense to wait that long for them to come off.

Admittedly, that didn't stop me starving myself in the hope I could get back to a size 10 (six years on, I'm still not there).

Our bodies don't just get bigger in pregnancy, they change shape, too. The ligaments around a woman's pelvis stretch to make it easier to give birth. It takes at least a few weeks for them to go back towards their earlier shape.

Yet we are taunted by images of celebrity mothers who seem to give birth on Tuesday and are back on the red carpet looking whip thin by the weekend.

Actress Kate Hudson says she spent six hours a day working out to get her pre-baby body back. Victoria Beckham exercised six days a week with celebrity trainer Tracy Anderson after the birth of daughter Harper.

While it's important that new mothers in the real world remember the stars have personal trainers, special diets and nannies to allow them to focus on their bodies, the real lesson is that it's far better to spend this time bonding with your baby.

Kate shows every sign of doing this. She's retreated to her parents' home in Berkshire to be cared for while she gets on with the important job of resting and nesting with her new family. Despite the pressure she must feel - she does, after all have the eyes of the world on her - she has already shown her pride in her post-birth bump.

I wish I'd seen more famous mummy tummies like Kate's before I had my son. It would have brought home to me the incredible, indelible changes that my body had gone through. I wouldn't have felt that my softer bump was ugly. I would have stopped bullying my body, respected my shape and embraced the change.

Let's hope that Kate helps the next generation of new mothers to do the same.
