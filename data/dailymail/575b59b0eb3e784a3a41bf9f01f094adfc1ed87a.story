A fatal police shooting was captured on an Oklahoma officer's bodycam and reveals the stark split second decision he made.

Muskogee police officer Chansey McMillin killed Terence D. Walker on Saturday when the 21-year-old ran away after being confronted outside a wedding.

Officer McMillin gave chase after Walker bolted when frisked outside the church and fired five times as Walker turned to face him momentarily - armed with a gun, according to McMillin.

Show me your hands: Officer McMillin approaches Terence Walker outside the Old Agency Baptist Church on Saturday

Flash point: Walker breaks free from Officer McMillin in a flash and begins to flee the parking lot after being frisked

Fatal decision: Walker appears to drop something while running and without really breaking stride bends to pick it up - but faces Officer McMillin while he does so

Gunfire: Officer McMillin shoots at Walker five times and strikes him three times in the neck and the abdomen and kills him. The 21-year-old then falls into the ditch to his right

The shocking incident took only one minute to unfold from the time that McMillin arrived at the Old Agency Baptist Church to its fatal conclusion.

Repeat: Saturday's incident was the second time in six months that Officer McMillin has shot a member of the public while in the line of duty

McMillin had responded to a call that Walker had threatened an ex-girlfriend during the day allegedly telling her he 'had a bullet with her name on it'.

The bodycam shows that McMillin walks towards Walker in the parking lot and asks him to produce both his hands, which Walker does.

Officer McMillin then puts Walker's hands behind his body and begins to frisk him, asking him if there is anything he should be worried about.

McMillin also asks Walker why he is shaking and then suddenly, Walker breaks free and flees.

Giving chase, McMillin is heard to immediately shout, 'Drop the gun, I am running', and then the camera shows Walker lose his balance and appear to drop something.

He stoops while still moving to pick it up and seems to face McMillin for a split second.

At that point the officer fires his weapon five times and Walker falls to the ground.

According to Tulsa World, even in slow motion speed it is unclear if Walker ever really faces the officer, or if he was merely checking to see where he was.

Regardless, Walker was struck three times and fell into a ditch on the side of the road. 

By this point, only one minute and seven seconds have expired on the bodycam after McMillin exited his car to approach Walker.

Pleas: The pastor of the Old Agency Baptist Church rushes to beg Officer McMillin to allow him to check on the body. McMillin refuses

'I was in a bad spot,' McMillin told a backup officer who arrived four minutes and forty seconds into the video.

Since the shooting, Sgt. Mike Mahan has told Tulsa World that McMillin feared for the safety of civilians behind him and traffic if Walker fired on the run.

In the harrowing aftermath of the shooting, it is already clear that Walker has been killed and the church's pastor rushes up to McMillin to ask him if he can check on the 21-year-old.

McMillin refuses to allow him to do this and when his backup arrives, which numbers at least 10 other officers, one of them retrieves what he says is a loaded gun from Walker's awkwardly crumpled body.

In the confused minutes after the shooting, the same pastor arrives to tell McMillan's colleagues the officer had 'followed procedures and he did everything right'.

Fatal: The mangled and crumpled body of Walker is examined by officers for a weapon. They eventually find one

McMillin then approaches the trunk of a squad car and rests his head on it, clearly shaken while a colleague pats him on the back and consoles him.

'Why'd he have to do that?' McMillan is heard to ask.

According to Sgt. Mahan, 'A female witness said that he had tried to hand her a gun, but she wouldn't take it. When officers began to pat Walker down, they felt the gun, and he started to run away.'

McMillan is told that he needs to go back to the station, presumably to complete a debriefing and asks when he can turn the camera off.

An ambulance arrives on the scene almost nine minutes after the incident began and eight minutes after Walker was shot.

Response: As Officer McMillin is driven away from the scene an ambulance arrives - almost eight minutes after Walker was shot

The first officer on the scene other than McMillin arrived one minute and 19 seconds after Walker was shot.

McMillin is one of 60 Muskogee Police officers using bodycams as their use across the country increases following the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in August.

The shooting came two days before Martin Luther King Jr. Day and McMillin is currently on paid administrative leave.

It has emerged that this is the second shooting he has been involved with in the space of six months.

In July, McMillin was cleared when he opened fire on a man who had attacked another with a knife and had begun to stab himself.

When the man moved on McMillin he opened fire. The man survived and Muskogee Police Chief Rex Eskridge said that his officer should be commended for his non-lethal use of force.
