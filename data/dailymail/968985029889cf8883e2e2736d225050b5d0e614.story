Tragedy: Lady Jean Hilda Patricia Bancroft, from Wandsworth, London, died after her legs became tangled in her dog's lead and she fell over

The elderly widow of a top civil servant died after tripping over when her legs became tangled in the lead of the dog she adored.

And such was her devotion to cairn terrier Cassie, that despite needing urgent treatment to a serious head wound, Lady Jean Bancroft refused to go to hospital until she was assured her beloved pet would be cared for.

An inquest heard that passers-by rushed to Lady Bancroft’s aid after the fall outside her home in Wandsworth, South-West London, on August 5.

An ambulance was called, but when paramedics tried to take her to hospital the 87-year-old turned them down, determined to go home with her dog instead.

Westminster Coroner’s Court heard that Lady Bancroft, whose husband Baron Ian Bancroft was head of the Home Civil Service before his death in 1996, was ‘fiercely independent’ and took Cassie out for a walk each day despite health problems and a history of falling over.

However, once she arrived at hospital her condition quickly worsened, and she lost consciousness and slipped into a coma.

She died a week later after several days on a life support machine.

Coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe gave Lady Bancroft’s cause of death as severe traumatic brain injury. 

Lady Bancroft’s daughter Emma Haines, 54, said: ‘Mum loved  animals and had several dogs –  previously they were retrievers. She had had Cassie for seven years and adored her.

‘She had a dog walker in recent years to take Cassie out in the morning, but she would still go out herself in the evenings to take her for a walk locally.’

Lady Bancroft met her husband when he was studying at Oxford in 1948, and the couple married at the city’s register office in 1950.

An inquest heard that Lady Bancroft, whose husband Baron Ian Bancroft was head of the Home Civil Service before his death in 1996, was 'fiercely independent' and took Cassie out for a walk each day despite health problems and a history of falls

Determined: Lady Bancroft, who married Baron Bancroft in 1950 and has two sons and a daughter, refused to accept she had been momentarily knocked unconscious, despite the one inch cut on her head

Baron Bancroft rose to his position 
at the top of the civil service in 1978, but Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher effectively ended his career by  abolishing the Civil Service 
Department in 1981.

The 
couple had three children, Emma and brothers Simon, 60, and Adam, who 
died in 1999 of cancer aged 43. Eight grandchildren followed and, eight 
months ago, Lady Bancroft was ‘thrilled’ when her granddaughter Megan, 
one of Simon’s children, gave birth to great-granddaughter Emily.

Mrs Haines said: ‘Mum loved  life, she adored her family.

Her children, grandchildren and great-grandchild were everything to her. She had lots of friends and was very much loved.

Death: She eventually went to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, pictured, but sadly died a few days later

She donated to the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability because my father was chairman for a while before he died.

‘Mum kept in contact and raised money for them.

‘She
was full of vim and vigour – and she died only just before what would 
have been her 88th birthday. She was very independent for her age – she 
was still driving and we went on holiday with her to Dallas in May.’

Lady
Bancroft’s funeral was held at Putney Vale Crematorium on August 28, 
when Mrs Haines said three rangers from Wimbledon Common formed a guard 
of honour on horseback outside. ‘Mum spent a lot of time on the common 
with her dogs – she was a supporter of the conservators and was great 
friends with the rangers,’ Mrs Haines said.

The inquest heard that Lady Bancroft had medical problems and a history of falls.

Delivering
her verdict, coroner Dr Radcliffe said: ‘Lady Bancroft was a fiercely 
independent 87-year-old who had significant medical problems and a 
fairly consistent history of falls.

‘She was walking her dog when the lead became tangled in her legs. I conclude that she died as a result of an accident.’
