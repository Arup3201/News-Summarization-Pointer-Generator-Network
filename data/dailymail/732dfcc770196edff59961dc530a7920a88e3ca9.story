It is a chilling vision of what could happen if civilisation ended today.

A Japanese artist has created an exhibition showing what everyday gadgets and items could look like in 100 years’ time if left to rot.

Maico Akiba's  exhibition, 100 Years Later, attempts to
 recreate what the archaeologists of the future would find if 
investigating 21st century civilization.

A Japanese artist has created an exhibition showing what everyday gadgets could look like in 100 years' time

She applied a coat of ‘ageing paint’ to objects including an iPhone, a camera, an iPod and a computer keyboard so as to make them look as though they are from a bygone era.

This involved covering them in moss, rust and dirt to create sculptures so realistic they are mind-boggling.

She has also worked her magic on shoes, shirts, a tub of ice cream and a cuckoo clock.

Ms Akiba has previously been associated with sculptures depicting tiny worlds built on the backs of large animals.

The artist did not only work with gadgets, she also showed what other everyday items could look like in the future

The pictures also show the effects of aging on modern fashions such as shoes and boots

When she is not creating sculptures, Ms Akiba is an illustrator of children's books

She did not only work with gadgets, she also showed how the aging process could affect a cuckoo clock

She also worked with larger objects such as vending machines and billboards

Ms Akiba also created sculptures from personal items such as glasses

Jewellery and jewellery cases are also included in the 100 Years Later exhibition

The huge collection of aged objects has attracted global interest

Ms Akiba worked with some of the most up to date gadgets, but also with some slightly less state-of-the-art technology
