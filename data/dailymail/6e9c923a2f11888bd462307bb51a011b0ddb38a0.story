Sucking carbon dioxide out of the air might be used as a last-ditch attempt to stop global warming, UN scientists say.

The technology is proposed as a ‘Plan B’ if Governments fail to cut carbon dioxide emissions by up to 70 per cent before 2050.

Reducing greenhouse gases to manageable levels will cost up to four per cent of global GDP by 2030, according to a draft version of a report to be published in Berlin on Sunday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

The 'sucking CO2' technology would involve growing crops that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere then burning them in a power station to generate energy. A biomass plant is pictured. The resulting emissions would then be captured at the plant and then stored underground, resulting in CO2being removed from the air

Experts could be able to 'suck' carbon dioxide out of the air by using an experimental system called BECCS –Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage.

It would involve growing crops that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere then burn them in a power station to generate energy.

The resulting emissions would then be captured at the plant and then stored underground.

The net effect of that process would result in CO2 being removed from the air.

Britain
 would be an ideal place to try the technology, because there are 
thousands of old coal mines and gas wells which could be used as storage
 facilities for carbon dioxide.

That would involve Britain and other nations increasing spending ten-fold on wind farms and other green projects over the next 15 years.

But if carbon emissions ‘overshoot’ the targets, more extreme solutions are needed which will send the costs spiralling even higher, the IPCC says.

A leaked copy of the report, seen by the Daily Mail, suggests Governments might have to start looking at ‘negative emissions’ technology which effectively suck CO2 out of the air and store it underground.

The leaked draft concludes that ‘essentially any’ emissions target can be achieved ‘regardless of the near‐term path’ of overshoot ‘by shifting emissions reductions to the future’.

But it says doing so ‘involves more rapid and deeper emissions reductions in the long run’.

The system has been tested at small scale in the USA and Canada – but the IPCC admits it would have to happen on a huge scale to be effective.

Joris Koornneef, an expert at sustainable energy consultancy Ecofys, estimates an area the size of India would be needed to produce enough biomass crops for BECCS to suck 10 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide from the air – a third of the emissions reduction needed by 2050.

There are also concerns about how safe the technology is and whether it is even possible to store carbon dioxide underground long-term without it leaking.

The draft IPCC chapter on energy systems says: ‘A combination of bio-energy and carbon capture and storage (BECCS) generally will result in net negative emissions.  BECCS is one of the few technologies that are capable to remove past CO2 emissions remaining the atmosphere.’

But it adds: ‘The risks associated with a large-scale deployment of carbon capture and storage include concerns about the life-cycle toxicity of some capture solvents, the operational safety and long-term integrity of CO2 storage sites, as well as risks associated with CO2 transport via dedicated pipelines.’

The British Government is already exploring options for capturing carbon from coal and gas-fired plants and hopes to get 13 gigawatts of fossil fuel power with carbon capture systems online by 2030. But it is sceptical about the potential of the ‘carbon negative’ technology involved with the BECCS system.

British officials have already asked the IPCC to alter the section on BECCS. In a document obtained by the Daily Mail, which criticises the wording of the draft, British representatives said: ‘It is essential that the limitations of this technology, and the uncertainty and scale, are clearly set out.’

Other nations, including China, Japan and Russia, also said the prospects for a ‘negative emissions’ technology should be toned down.

Sven Teske of Greenpeace said there are many uncertainties associated with storing carbon dioxide.

He said: ‘It might work in countries like the UK and Norway where there are lots of empty oil wells and gas wells.

‘But compared to the problem it can only play a minor role. And we don’t actually know if the CO2 will even remain in the ground.

‘Overall it would be much cheaper to just go to straight to a carbon neutral renewable technology.’

Conclusive? Last September the first part of the IPCC's report summarised the physical science of climate change, concluding that scientists are 95 per cent certain that humans are the 'dominant cause' of global warming

The IPCC report is the first major assessment in seven years of the technological options and economic costs of dealing with climate change.

The document is the final part in a trilogy of reports published by the IPCC on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change.

Last September the first part of the report summarised the physical science of climate change, concluding that scientists are 95 per cent certain that humans are the ‘dominant cause’ of global warming.

The second part, published a fortnight ago, warned that the drastic impacts of climate change are ‘already occurring on all continents and across the oceans’.

The draft of the third report says that reducing global warming to 2C, beyond which the impacts would start to become irreversible, ‘will require large-scale changes of the global energy system as well as cuts in greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades’.

It adds: ‘Delaying mitigation [to] 2030 will increase the challenges of, and reduce the options for, bringing atmospheric concentration levels [to safe levels] by the end of the century.’
