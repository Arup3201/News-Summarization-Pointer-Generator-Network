Controversial: Mario Balotelli with girlfriend Raffaella Fico. Police officers were called to the Manchester City striker's home after neighbours mistook him for a burglar

Police officers who rushed to the home of footballer Mario Balotelli following reports that his luxurious pad was being ransackedwere amazed to discover that the 'burglar' was the star himself.

The 21-year-old Italian had returned to his £3million home with a friend to collect electrical goods following a blaze there last month.

Friends of the striker had set off fireworks in the bathroom of his rented home in Mottram St Andrew, Cheshire, and since then he has been living away.

However, on returning to his luxury property recently neighbours failed to recognise the Manchester City striker and called the police, thinking that the home was being burgled.

A source told The Sun: 'The report was of two men running down a road carrying stuff and loading up a 4x4.'

The blaze wrecked the first floor bathroom and a room directly below at the property in Manchester's stockbroker belt.

The star and his friends escaped 
unhurt after fleeing the fire at 1am, just 36 hours before Balotelli and
his team-mates faced their most important game of the season  - against Manchester United at Old Trafford.

Ten firefighters tackled the blaze at the house, which was described as ‘a substantial fire’.

The property sustained serious fire and smoke damage.

Balotelli was reported to have told club officials that he and four friends had been letting off fireworks through an open window at the house, which had been advertised for rent at £7,500 a month.

Bathroom towels were set on fire and the flames spread but Balotelli has insisted that he did not cause the blaze and that the offending firework was let off by his friends.
