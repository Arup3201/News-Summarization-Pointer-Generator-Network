A toddler has become an unlikely internet sensation after taking part in the Ice Bucket Challenge before promptly blurting out the F-word - much to the horror of her grandmother.

Three-year-old Scarlett-Rose Davis begged her grandparents to let her take part in the craze which is currently taking the world by storm in aid of motor neurone disease.

But grandmother Carla Davis-Ball, said she 'could have died' when the little girl blurted out 'f***ing hell' after tipping an icy bucket of water over her head - and the episode was all caught on camera.

Potty mouth: Three-year-old Scarlett-Rose Davis turned the air blue during an ice bucket challenge - and her doting grandparents have now revealed she intends to try out for Britain's Got Talent as a rapper

Mrs Davis-Ball recorded the footage of Scarlett-Rose being doused with warm water from a cooking pot after nominating a young friend called Marshall to take the challenge last weekend.

After she put
 it on Facebook and her husband Stuart Ball, 33, uploaded it to YouTube,
 it has been viewed more than 40,000 times since Monday, and has been shared several thousand times around the world.

The 40-year-old, from Coalpool in Walsall, West Midlands, said: 'I couldn't believe it when she came out with that language.

Staying warm: Mrs Davie-Brown did not want Scarlett-Rose to be cold, so she was allowed to do the challenge on the condition she used warm water from a cooking pot instead of a bucket of ice

Polite: Mrs Davis-Ball joked the three-year-old would have to watch her language on the television show

'She has picked up a few bad words when we have gone out for meals or into town.

'It did shock me but she's so clever I'm not surprised she's picked it up. We told her it was a naughty word.

'Children have brains like sponges and I can't stop it. But she does know it's wrong.

'I have to say when I heard her swearing I nearly died with laughter. I know it's wrong but it's the same reaction most adults would have after being drenched in ice water.

'We did tell her not to say rude words and she is normally very good and polite.'

She begged her grandparents to let her take part in the ice bucket challenge and they agreed only if they could use warm water.

'She had seen some of the ice bucket videos on my phone and seen one of my friends do it,' said mother-of-three Mrs Davis-Ball.

'She said: "Nanny, can I do that?"

'I wasn't keen on her having ice water poured over her so I said we'd use warm water from the cooking pot.

'It makes me so happy that a three-year-old picked on a good cause and wanted to get involved. She knows it's for poorly people.'

Scarlett-Rose has a baby brother called Shankley-Gary, aged ten months.

The couple care for the children five nights a week and they spend two nights with their mother Demi Davis, 19.

Now say sorry! Mrs Davis-Ball tells her granddaughter to apologise for using the bad language

Family: Scarlett with her grandfather Stuart Bell, who uploaded the clip of the stunt to Youtube

Ms Davis-Ball, from Coalpool in Walsall, West Midlands, said: 'I couldn't believe it when she came out with that language'

'The reaction to the video has blown my mind,' Mrs Davis-Ball said.

'My phone is on charge constantly because of all the comments we have received.'

Miss Davis said she was surprised that so many people had seen the video of her daughter.

'The reaction to the video has blown my mind,' she said.

'My phone is on charge constantly because of all the comments have received.'

But Mr Ball, who filmed the clip, said the little girl has no idea she had become an internet sensation.

'The response has been overwhelming. People in America and China were viewing the video and commenting on it,' he said.

Worldwide: Mr Ball said the response  was 'overwhelming', with people viewing the clip in America and China

Picture of innocence: But the three-year-old's granddaughter said she knows what she wants - fame

'Scarlett-Rose doesn't really understand what the fuss is about which is probably a good thing.

'We're
 very proud she took part in the ice bucket challenge and if her 
swearing raises more money for the charity then it's a positive 
outcome.'

Scarlett-Rose is not the youngest person to take the ice bucket challenge.

A video of a seven-month-old baby having a small plastic cup of water poured over its head was also posted on YouTube earlier this month.

The craze has raised Â£48 million in less than a month in aid of research into motor neurone disease.

The disease affects the brain and the spinal cord, causing motor neurones to degenerate and die, leading to gradual paralysis and eventually death.
