A southern California couple were forced to make urgent changes to their wedding plans after the groom was diagnosed with a brain tumor.

Nicholas Brzuska and Destiny Hernandez had been engaged for two years when just three weeks before their wedding day, doctors discovered a four-ounce tumor inside Nicholas’ brain that required immediate surgery.

The couple had chosen to wed on January 4, 2015, to celebrate the anniversary of the date that Nicholas had first said he loved Destiny, but doctors feared he would not be strong enough by then.

Three weeks before their wedding, Nicholas and Destiny Brzuska discovered that he would require urgent surgery for a brain tumor. Not wanting to wait they decided to get married that night (pictured)

Having rallied friends and family together on the day of his diagnosis, they got married at a 24-hour chapel near where they live, and Nicholas' operation was scheduled for January 6, two days after they were meant to marry

Their original venue, the Garden Room in Garden Grove, California, will not let them reschedule their wedding plans nor give them a refund 

They rallied friends and family, found a 24-hour chapel in Long Beach and got married that same night, December 13, 2014.

Destiny contacted the original wedding venue, The Garden Room in Garden Grove, California, and still wanting their dream wedding, explained the situation and asked if they could push back the date.

Destiny told ABC7 Eyewitness News that there is nothing in the contract that prohibits the couple from pushing the date back, but a manager at the venue denied her request and said that the $3,600 deposit was non-refundable.

The owner of the venue, Lisa Waddell, told Eyewitness News she had no comment on the matter.

‘I was in tears, like how can you do this, and still the owner has not called,’ Destiny said.

Doctors successfully removed the tumor from Nicholas' brain on January 6, 2015, and he is now in recovery.

He is still blown away by the lack of sympathy for their situation: ‘[It's] disconcerting knowing that there's people like that out there. All they are [is] money-hungry,’ he said.

With their dream wedding ceremony planned for December 13, 2015, to mark their one year wedding anniversary, they couple are still looking for a new venue.

On her Facebook page Destiny posted: ‘We want to Thank everyone for all the support! We really appreciate it!’
