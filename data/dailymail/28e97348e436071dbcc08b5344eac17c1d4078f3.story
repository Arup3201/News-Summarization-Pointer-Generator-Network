Belarus are looking for a new coach after Georgi Kondratiev resigned in the wake of his side's Euro 2016 qualifying defeat to Slovakia.

Monday's 3-1 loss in Borisov left Belarus with one point from their opening three Group C games and led the 54-year-old Kondratiev to step down from his post after three years in charge.

The Belarus FA confirmed in a statement on its official website that, following talks between the Kondratiev and BFF head Sergei Rumas, it was mutually agreed to terminate the coach's contract.

Kondratiev said on www.uefa.com: 'The result is fair. We lost to a classier team. You saw today that Slovakia are on a higher level. It's not enough to just have commitment if you want to win - you need to be able to play football and we played worse than them.

'As we did not get a result, the coach has to leave. I promised that and I will resign. But our players will not play differently. That is the result of the last 25 years. We are lagging behind the leading countries. Slovakia are not a super-team, but we are lagging behind them as well.'

Belarus' next qualifier is against two-time reigning European champions Spain in Huelva on November 15.
