A great-grandfather has been reunited with a treasured family heirloom that was lost more than 70 years ago - after it was found by a stranger he met by chance in a snooker club.

Raymond Trump, 82, thought it was already a strange coincidence that the man he bumped into in his local Liberal Club had lived in the same Bristol house he grew up in.

But when the man asked if he could shed any light on a locket he had found, Mr Trump was amazed - inside were pictures of himself and his late sister as children.

Heirloom: Raymond Trump, 82, has been reunited with a locket owned by his mother that was lost more than 70 years ago

The man, identified only as Mike, had found the locket years earlier while digging out an old air raid shelter in the garden.

Mr Trump said he remembered his mother wearing the locket around her neck when he was a small child.

It contained a picture of himself as a young boy and a childhood photograph of his sister Jean, who died aged 48 in 1978.

Mr Trump said he did not remember his mother ever having mentioned that she had lost the locket.

He said: 'I can't really believe all the coincidences that have led to me having possession of the locket again.

'To this day the locket has kept its colour and the photographs inside are perfect.

'During
the war when I was a young boy I remember spending lots of time in the 
air raid shelter with my mother and my brothers and sisters.

'She must have lost the locket down there but I never knew.

'I am so pleased to see the locket again and to remember my mother and sister.'

Mr
Trump, who has four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren, has 
given the locket to his niece Lorraine, 62, who is Jean's daughter.

It had been mislaid while the family lived in a house in Bedminster, Bristol, where the stranger Mike also grew up years later.

Mr Trump left the house at the age of 21 and settled in the Fishponds area of Bristol with his wife and their daughters, Diane and Jane.

Mr Trump said: 'Hearing that he lived at that address - you could have knocked me down with a feather.

'That house was where I grew up and used to live with my mother and siblings.

'We had a good chat about Bedminster and the old times, I couldn't believe what a coincidence it was.'

Mr Trump's daughter Diane, 60, of Emersons Green, Bristol, said: 'This locket was lost for more than 70 years and would have remained that way had my dad not bumped into this man at his snooker club.

'Unfortunately. we are no longer in contact with the man who lives in dad's old house but are so grateful to him for returning this locket to our family.

'It has been perfectly preserved underground where the old air raid shelter was this whole time.

'It was lovely to see dad as a young boy - we think he is about seven years old in the picture - and his sister Jean, who we think is about ten.

'The whole family is just thrilled and we wanted to share this lovely story with everyone.'
