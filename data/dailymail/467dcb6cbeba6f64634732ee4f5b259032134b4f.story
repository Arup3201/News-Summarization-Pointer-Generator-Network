Two drug smugglers who helped import cocaine worth up to £10.4 million into the country have each been ordered to repay just £10.

Michael Ebanks, 33, and Mark West, 37, were told they have just 28 days to pay the sum - which is a mere 0.0005 per cent of what the drugs were worth.

Ebanks, of Bromley, south London, was arrested at Portsmouth International Port on October 18 last year after he was found with 52kg of high-purity cocaine.

 The benefit of the conspiracy was £2,068,140 to Ebanks and £1,946,839 to West, but a confiscation hearing was told the available amount from each man was a nominal sum of only £10.

The drugs, brought over from Spain, had a street value of between £4.8 million and £10.4 million.

Ebanks was initially sentenced to 15 years in jail at Portsmouth Crown Court for conspiracy to fraudulently evade the prohibition on the importation of cocaine between April 2011 and October 2012.

Meanwhile, West, from Purley, south London, received a 14-year jail term for conspiracy to import cocaine.

However, Ebanks had his sentence increased to 20 years, while West had his increased to 19 years at the Court of Appeal in London last month.

The cocaine was being smuggled hidden in crates of recycled rubber, which Ebanks claimed was for resale to tyre companies.

Ebanks had denied taking part in the conspiracy, saying he had been duped by others.

But a jury found him guilty of the charge following a trial.

Portsmouth Crown Court heard Ebanks had made several trips to Malaga to organise the import of the drugs, and had made repeated journeys to a remote farm in West Sussex where the drugs were stored.

Meanwhile, West pleaded guilty to his role in the conspiracy.

Recorder John Trevaskis ordered that Ebanks and West should each serve an extra one day in prison if they do not pay the full £10 within the next 28 days.

After the original sentencing at Portsmouth Crown Court in July, John Locke, Senior Crown Prosecutor for the Complex Casework Unit of the Crown Prosecution Service had said he hoped their 'ill-gotten gains' could be 'confiscated'.

He said: 'Their criminal enterprise ended on 18 October 2012, when UK Border Agency officials intercepted a lorry and trailer arriving at Portsmouth International Port from Caen, France.

'A total of 52 packages of cocaine were retrieved from three of the pallets, weighing in excess of 52 kilograms.

'Of those bags that have been tested, the drugs have been assessed as having a purity of between 67 per cent and 91 per cent.

'If these drugs had been in circulation on the streets, one can imagine the damage it would have created and the numbers of criminal activities it would have generated.

'We will now be looking at confiscating their ill-gotten assets.'
