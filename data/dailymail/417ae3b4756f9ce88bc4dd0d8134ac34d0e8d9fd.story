Chelsea's Under 15 side got a chance to learn from the very best on Monday as Blues captain John Terry took further steps towards a coaching career in the future.

Terry, who made his 648th Chelsea appearance in the 2-0 Premier League win against Newcastle last Saturday, took the youngsters for an indoor training session at the club's Cobham training base.

The 34-year-old took to Instagram to share several images of the session as Terry revealed he was 'putting in the hours' for his coaching badges.

The Chelsea skipper has been in sparkling form for Jose Mourinho's side so far this season as he looks to earn another one-year contract extension to his current deal before the season is out.

Terry also claimed that fans won't be catching him patrolling the touchline in a club tracksuit in the future, revealing he will strictly be a 'shirt and tie manager'.

He wrote: 'Putting in the hours for my coaching badges this morning with the U15s.

Kurt Zouma claims he has 'learned a lot' from playing alongside Chelsea stalwart Terry

'Still a long way to go but enjoying the process. I'm defo a shirt and tie manager'.

Chelsea defender Kurt Zouma was full of praise for Terry's leadership skills following his side's win against Newcastle which saw the 20-year-old Frenchman play alongside the former England captain.

Zouma told Chelsea's official website: 'Terry helps me a lot when the striker goes behind me or when the striker drops back and I have to follow. Cahill is the same. Tactically, technically and physically I have learned a lot.'

As the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and James Rodriguez attended the 2014 Ballon d'Or awards in Zurich, Terry capped off a busy day of coaching by watching the 2015 Dafabet Masters snooker match between Robert Milkins and Neil Robertson at Alexandra Palace....
