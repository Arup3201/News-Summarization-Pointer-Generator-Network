Loss: Liam's mother Deborah Collier, 35, who tragically died on 24 February following a battle with cancer

His mother Deborah Collier, 35, tragically died on 24 February following a battle with cancer.

Friends said the teenager was heartbroken by her loss and told them 'I want to be with my mum'.

A neighbour on Liam’s street said her daughter was friends with the tragic youngster and had heard from another pal that Liam had hanged himself.

She said: 'I’m gobsmacked. His friends tried to pull him down but they didn’t know he was going to do it.'

She said Liam’s death may have stemmed from what happened to his mother.

She said: 'I’ve been told that he said ‘I want to be with my mum’. I can see that being the only possible reason he’s done it.

'His mum had been poorly for about two years. Then they found it had been terminal.'

She said Liam was 'cheeky' and 'mischievous', adding: 'He had a heart of gold.'

Friends are thought to have found his body at woods in Barnsley on Monday evening and tried to pull him down.

A man standing outside Liam's family home
 confirmed his father Alan had already lost his wife and was 
'devastated.' Numerous online tributes were made to the teenager.

Friends of the teen have been leaving tributes on-line. One read: 'You was so young and such a great boy Liam, we was close friends and always had a laugh, don’t know what I’m going to do without you:( guess your where you wanted to be safe in heaven with your mummy:('

Another friend said: 'A heart of gold stopped beating, two shining eyes at rest, God broke our hearts to prove, He only takes the best. Rest in Peace liam you'll be safe with your mum now in heaven.'

In a message to Deborah on a tribute site in her memory, a cousin wrote: 'Not sure what to say today Debs, the bad news again but at least Liam will now be with you and your mum, bless you all xx'

Liam is believed to have died from hanging and a post mortem is due to be carried out shortly

Tributes to Liam lay on the damp and muddy ground and against a downed tree in the wooded area where his body was found.

Around 25 bunches of flowers lay neatly together and one framed photo of Liam. 

One read: 'RIP Liam 30/04/12 sleep tight big boy.'

Another read: 'To Liam. Am really going to miss you al (sic) never forget you, look after your mum and look after Zena, don’t forget me.'

'To Liam RIP. Your with your mum now. Sleep tight,' read another.

A South Yorkshire Police spokeswoman 
said: 'South Yorkshire Police were called at 8.30pm after an incident in
 a wooded area in Barnsley.

'Emergency services arrived at the scene and shortly afterwards a local 15-year-old-boy was pronounced dead.

'Police are not treating the incident as suspicious.'
