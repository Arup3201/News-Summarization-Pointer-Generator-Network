Iran's intelligence chief said on Thursday there are holes in the U.S. allegations that Iranian agents plotted to kill the Saudi ambassador to the United States, and dismissed the American claims as a 'foolish plot' nobody will believe.

Two men, including an alleged member of Iran's special foreign actions unit known as the Quds Force, have been charged in New York federal court with conspiring to kill the Saudi diplomat, Adel Al-Jubeir.

Tehran has strongly denied any link to the alleged plot, and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has accused Washington of using the case to divert attention from its economic woes and the Occupy Wall Street protest movement.

On Thursday, Iran's intelligence 
minister, Heidar Moslehi, dismissed the American allegations, saying no 
professional intelligence agency would issue orders to an agent in a 
foreign country over the phone or transfer money to drug cartels through
a New York bank.

'When you probe the allegations from 
an intelligence perspective, you find major contradictions and 
shortcomings and you can't believe a government like the U.S.... has 
ended up in a situation where it designs a foolish plot,' he said on 
state TV.

The Iranian government has denied any 
connection to Manssor Arbabsiar, the man arrested in the alleged plot, 
and derided the claims, saying U.S. officials have offered no proof.

'Which court of law can accept such absurd claims as evidence?' Moslehi asked.

Arbabsiar is a 56-year-old naturalized
U.S. citizen who also had an Iranian passport. In May 2011, the 
criminal complaint says, he approached someone he believed to be a 
member of the vicious Mexican narco-terror group, Los Zetas, for help 
with an attack on Al-Jubeir. The man he approached turned out to be an 
informant for U.S. drug agents, it says.

The U.S. government charges that 
Arbabsiar had been told by his cousin Abdul Reza Shahlai, a high-ranking
member of the Quds Force, to recruit a drug trafficker because drug 
gangs have a reputation for assassinations.

Moslehi said Arbabsiar, based on the 
U.S. judge's bill, made a telephone call to the alleged Quds force 
member from an FBI office after his arrest and the Americans' claim they
eavesdropped the conversation.

Suspect: Alleged terror plotter Manssor Arbabsiar's home in Round Rock, Texas

Accused: The home of terror plot suspect Manssor Arbabsiar in Round Rock, Texas

'What intelligence agency or officer 
will direct an agent stationed in a rival's territory by telephone? Or 
orders an assassination on the phone? Or assigns the restaurant - the 
venue of the planned assassination - and bargains over the price on the 
phone?' he asked.

Moslehi said even the weakest 
intelligence agencies in the world wouldn't hire a man with Arbabsiar 
background let alone assign him to an operation on U.S. soil.

The intelligence minister alleged 
instead that Arbabsiar, who acquired U.S. citizenship eight months ago, 
likely agreed to cooperate with American intelligence agencies in return
for his residency permit.

Moslehi said Iran doesn't need to resort to such terror plots and that Tehran would not benefit from killing a Saudi diplomat.

Moslehi claimed that Iran's security 
services have notched successes in an ongoing intelligence battle with 
the U.S., and said Washington now wants to tarnish Iran's image by 
attributing a 'clumsy' plot to Tehran.

He cited Iran's success in the arrest 
last year of Abdulmalik Rigi, leader of the Sunni militant group 
Jundallah. Jundallah, which has claimed responsibility for bombings that
have killed dozens in recent years, was behind an insurgency in Iran's 
southeast near the border with Pakistan.

Rigi was arrested alive by Iran's 
intelligence agents when he was flying over the Persian Gulf en route 
from Dubai to Kyrgyzstan. He was later tried and executed.

May 24: Arbabsiar first meets someone posing as an associate of a drug trafficking cartel in Mexico, who was actually a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration informant codenamed CS-1. Arbabsiar asked about the informant's knowledge of explosives and explained he was interested in attacking a Saudi embassy.

June 2: Arbabsiar returned to Mexico and held more meetings with the informant in late June and early July. He allegedly said his associates in Iran had discussed a number of 'violent missions' including the murder of the Saudi ambassador to Washington, Adel Al-Jubeir.

July 14: Arbabsiar meets CS-1 again, they discuss plot details - how four men and a payment of $1.5 million are needed.

July 17: The pair meet again in Mexico. CS-1 says one member of his gang has already carried out surveillance on the ambassador and they allegedly discussed bombing a restaurant in the United States where the ambassador frequently dined.

August 1 and 9: Arbabsiar makes two overseas wire transfers 'totalling approximately $100,000'

September 28: Arbabsiar flies to Mexico, is refused entry and is sent back to JFK

September 29: Arrested at JFK by federal agents

October 4-5: Arbabsiar, who has been in U.S. custody since his arrest, made phone calls which were monitored by U.S. law enforcement agents to Shakuri, described as a member of the Quds Force, a branch of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. He is believed to be based in Iran.

Shakuri allegedly confirmed to Arbabsiar the plot should move forward as quickly as possible, stating: 'Just do it quickly, it's late'
