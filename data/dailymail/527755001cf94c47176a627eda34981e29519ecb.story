Southampton will offer Toby Alderweireld a four-year contract to to secure the defender's long-term future this month.

The Belgium international has been excellent for the Saints this season following his loan move from Atletico Madrid, playing a key role in the club's push for Europe.

Manager Ronald Koeman wants to make the loan switch permanent this month as he looks to avoid a battle for his signature in the summer.

The Saints have opened talks with Atletico regarding a move this month, with the Spanish club keen to recoup as much of the £6.2million they paid Ajax in 2013.

Should the two clubs reach an agreement, Saints will offer Alderweireld a four-year deal, though they will be unable to match his current £75,000-per-week wages.

Alderweireld's loan deal expires at the end of the season.
