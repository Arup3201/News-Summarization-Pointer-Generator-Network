Bury took advantage of Burton's Friday night loss to go top of the League Two table with a 2-0 defeat of Tranmere at Gigg Lane.

Kelvin Etuhu and Daniel Nardiello struck in the second half as they consigned struggling Rovers to a third straight loss.

Wycombe also edged above the Brewers but could not quite reach the summit after a 1-1 home draw with Northampton, who went ahead through Ryan Creswell but had Gregor Robertson sent off late on before Aaron Holloway levelled eight minutes into stoppage time.

At the other end of the table, Keith Curle continued to enjoy a honeymoon period as Carlisle boss as United moved off the bottom by leapfrogging Hartlepool with a 3-0 success at the Victoria Ground.

Steven Rigg, Stephen Elliott and Mark Beck scored for the Cumbrians to give Curle back-to-back victories since taking charge when they had not won all season.

Meanwhile, John Coleman has started his second spell at Accrington with three straight wins after Luke Joyce struck from the penalty spot at Mansfield, who later had Adam Murray sent off.

Morecambe edged out Southend 1-0 at Roots Hall thanks to an early Jack Redshaw strike, while Plymouth beat Shrewsbury by the same scoreline thanks to Reuben Reid's effort. Michael Collins scored the only goal of the game as Oxford shaded Newport despite Tyrone Barnett seeing red.

Alex Wall hit the 83rd-minute winner as Luton secured a 2-1 success at Stevenage after Luke Wilkinson had put the Hatters ahead before Thomas Pett equalised.

AFC Wimbledon came from behind to draw 1-1 at Cheltenham as Adam Barrett replied to Matt Taylor's early strike, while there were no goals in the game between York and Portsmouth.
