Four minutes of crucial dash camera footage that might hold the truth behind a night in which an officer shot a man three times has gone missing.

Shoua Yang, of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, was shot three times by Officer Jason Chadbourne following a ten-person brawl at a Valentine's Day party at a banquet hall in January 2014.

And although there are three hours of footage on the officer's dash camera, the four minutes in which the shooting took place are unaccounted for.

Shoua Yang, of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, was shot three times by police officer Jason Chadbourne following a ten-person brawl at a Valentine's Day party in January 2014. But four minutes of footage from Chadbourne's squad car dash camera have gone missing

The fight that included ten males erupted outside the banquet hall shortly after 11 p.m., according to the Star Tribune.  

A criminal complaint said officers saw three men run into a car, and when they yelled at the men to stop and talk, the driver put the car in reverse directly toward Jason Chadbourne at high speed, according to KMSP.  

Chadbourne, then 23, reportedly fired his gun at the partygoer's car as he drove away from the scene and three bullets hit Yang, then 22

That's when Chadbourne, who was 23 at the time, reportedly fired his gun and three bullets hit Yang, then 22, as he was driving the car.

Yang, faced charges of second degree-felony assault after the brawl.

The partygoer, who now has a massive scar on his stomach, was acquitted on all charges last month and has brought up his side of the story in a new lawsuit. 

He claims he never knew the police were at the scene in the greater-Minneapolis suburb, that it was dark and snowy and that he and the other two in the car were just pulling out to leave.

Chadbourne allegedly shut the squad car's camera and his microphone off only to later turn it on again, according the the lawsuit. 

Attorney Bob Bennett, who filed the suit against the officer, claims Chadbourne fired at the three people in the car 'without being able to see what they're doing, were they are or whether they pose any danger'. 

'We don't let hunters shoot at game they can't identify. The same should be for police officers,' Bennett told KMSP. 

The suit also claimed Brooklyn Park police policy 'mandates officers utilize the devices to record all stops and contacts with the public'. 

The dash camera should be automatically turned on when lights and sirens are triggered, according to KMSP. 

Officer Chadbourne remains an employee at the Brooklyn Park police department.
