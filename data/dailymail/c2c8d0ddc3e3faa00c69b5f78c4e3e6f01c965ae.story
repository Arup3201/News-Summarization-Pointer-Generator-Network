The global chemical weapons
watchdog will investigate allegations chlorine gas has been used to carry out fatal attacks in Syrian villages.

It is understood that a probe will take place to examine reports that several chlorine 'barrel bombs' in the northwestern Idlib region of Syria have been used in attacks that killed six people and wounded dozens.

Ahmet Uzumcu, chief of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said the organisation would continue a current fact-finding mission into the use of 'toxic chemicals for hostile purposes' in Syria.

He added: 'The matter is of serious concern.'

Syrian regime forces have carried out airstrikes in the opposition-controlled district of Jobar in eastern Damascus, as the global weapons watchdog announced it will investigate claims chlorine gas has been used in the conflict

The investigation was announced as airstrikes have continued to be carried out by Syrian regime forces. 

Activists have accused the Syrian regime of using chlorine - a toxic agent that can be considered a chemical weapon - on civilian areas in the past.

'We have been monitoring the recent reports suggesting that toxic chemicals may have been used as weapons in the Idlib province in Syria,' Uzumcu added.

A monitoring group and opposition activists said six people, including three young children, were killed in the alleged regime gas attack in the village of Sarmin, in Idlib province 10 days ago. Amnesty International said the attack was further evidence of 'war crimes.' 

A report by the chemical weapons watchdog in January concluded 'with a high degree of confidence' that chlorine gas had been used in attacks on three villages in Syria last year. At least 13 people died in the attacks that were carried out from April to August, according to the report.

The OPCW's fact-finding mission last year found that the
use of chlorine gas is 'systematic' in the four-year Syrian
civil war, which has killed more than 200,000 people and
displaced millions. 

Both sides have denied using chlorine gas in the attacks, which are believed to be dropped onto villages using helicopters. The Syrian air
force is the only party in the conflict known to have
helicopters.

Syria joined the Chemical Weapons Convention in 2013,
agreeing to allow foreign weapons inspectors into the country
and averting U.S.-threatened air strikes after sarin attacks in
the outskirts of Damascus killed hundreds.

The government of President Bashar al Assad has since handed
over 1,300 tonnes of toxic chemicals and is destroying
production and storage facilities. The process of verifying that
the chemical weapons programme has been eliminated is
continuing.

Syria did not have to declare its stockpile of chlorine - a toxic agent that can be considered a chemical weapon - as part of a disarmament deal agreed in 2013 because it is widely used for commercial and domestic purposes.

The Assad regime and the rebels have accused each other of using chemical agents, including chlorine, in the nearly four-year war that has killed more than 210,000

US Secretary of State John Kerry said he was 'deeply
disturbed' by the reports of renewed use of chlorine gas, last
used widely in World War One.

The use of industrial chemicals as weapons is banned under
the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention.

A group monitoring the Syrian civil war said on Tuesday
government forces had carried out the poison gas attack that
killed six people in the northwestern town of Sarmin, not far
from the Turkish border.

Medics posted videos of children suffering what they said
was suffocation, which could be caused by a number of toxic
agents, including chlorine.

The OPCW team has a rolling mandate from the United Nations
to investigate chemical weapon use in Syria, but will need to
negotiate security arrangements with officials in Damascus if it
plans on site investigations.

The fact-finding mission has issued three reports on the use
of chlorine in Syria, most recently in December.
