Researchers have called for volunteers to help count penguins in the Antarctic from the comfort of their own home using thousands of photographs to identify adults, chicks and eggs.

The call has been placed by the Australian Antarctic Division (ADD), based in Hobart, to assist researchers at Oxford University in the UK to understand behaviour patterns, breeding and the effect predators have on penguins.

Volunteer counters will be studying images captured by 40 cameras spread across three regions of East Antarctica - from Mawson's station to Commonwealth Bay. 

Researchers ultimately hope this process will help develop an algorithm to teach computers how to automatically count penguins, the ABC reports.

Thousands of online photographs have been scanned by researchers for volunteer counters to assist in identifying adults, chickens and eggs 

The 200,000 photographs, many taken by AAD, will be used to explain how human activity and environmental changes impact penguins, so early warning signs can be identified and researchers can help prevent problems from arising.

Colin Southwell from AAD hopes the research will also  explain the impact of fisheries on a mass scale.

'What it's about is trying to use the interest of a large number of people out there through online communications to contribute to scientific research,' Dr Southwell said.

He said researchers are looking for non-scientists who are interested in science and penguins to contribute to the study. 

'Most people are interested in Antarctica. Most people are interested in penguins, and it's fun.' 

Volunteer Jenni Klaus told the ABC she came across the study on Twitter. She said although she never studied science she has always been interested.

'There are adorable chicks in some of the photos and you can never get too tired of looking at penguins,' she said. 

If the study proves successful researchers hope to count other seabirds in the Antarctic and Arctic.
