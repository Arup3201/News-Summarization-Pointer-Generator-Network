'I am taking this opportunity to announce that unfortunately Saturday was my last game for the New York Red Bulls,' Henry said on Monday.

'The decision has always been that I would leave after the duration of my contract and although that was never going to change, I didn't want it to distract from the progress of the team.

'You guys have really meant a lot to me and thank you for all your wonderful support. 

'I will now take the next few weeks to reflect and decide on the next chapter of my career. Thank you all.' 

Henry told L'Equipe on Friday that he will remain in football following his retirement as a player, telling the French newspaper he will become 'a coach, a consultant or executive'.

The 1998 World Cup winner admitted he regrets not helping Arsenal win the Champions League, and that he would like to play a part in their potential European success at the Emirates.

'Whether that is from near or far does not depend on me but it is sure I'd like to help,' Henry continued. 

'This is my club and, as a player, I was not able to give them the Champions League.' 

Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher wrote on Kicca following the announcement: 'Thierry Henry has played his last game for New York Red Bulls if it is his last game in football what a player! The best I faced without a doubt and yes I still have nightmares about him running past me at Anfield!!'

Henry joined the MLS side  in 2010 following stints with Monaco, Juventus, Arsenal and Barcelona.

His final game for the Red Bulls ended in a 4-3 aggregate defeat against rivals New England Revolution in the Eastern Conference Championship play-off. 

He  won the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000 with France, and was part of Arsenal's 'Invincibles' side that went unbeaten in the Premier League a decade ago.

I am taking this opportunity to announce that unfortunately Saturday was my last game for the New York Red Bulls. 

The decision has always been that I would leave after the duration of my contract and although that was never going to change, I didn't want it to distract from the progress of the team.

I have immensely enjoyed my four-and-a-half years here and would like to thank everyone involved with this club who has made my time here so enjoyable.

Thanks must go particularly to Erik Soler, Hans Backe, Gerard Houllier, Andy Roxburgh, Mike Petke, all my team-mates, the technical staff, medical staff, all the personnel who work for the Red Bull organisation, the MLS and of course the owner Mr Mateschitz whose vision and passion brought me to this wonderful city.

A special mention must go to the Red Bull fans who have supported this team through the good, the bad and the ugly times in the sun, rain and snow. 

You guys have really meant a lot to me and thank you for all your wonderful support.

I will now take the next few weeks to reflect and decide on the next chapter of my career.

Thank you all

Thierry Henry
