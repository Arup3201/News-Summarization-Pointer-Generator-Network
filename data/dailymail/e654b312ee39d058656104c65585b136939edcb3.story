A man has been captured clinging to the roof of a car as it sped around suburban streets on Australia Day on Monday.

The footage, shot in Melbourne, was uploaded to the Dash Cam Owners Australia Facebook page shows the unidentified male car surfing while other passengers hang out the windows.

Filmed by a passenger in the car driving behind the foolish man, the video shows him hanging on for dear life as the car winds through the streets.

A man was caught on camera car surfing on top of a vehicle through the streets of Melbourne on Australia Day

At various points in the footage the daredevil looks as though he could be flung from the car as it hits turns in the road and drivers over numerous speed humps.

The driver of the car travelling behind the packed-out one can be heard saying: 'If he falls off I'm going to run him over!', sounding worried.

'Just keep a safe distance', one of her passengers urged.

'I think they may have stolen that car,' another said.

The black car with the man hanging from the roof appears to be crammed full of passengers, who can be seen later flailing their arms from the windows.

At some stages the car surfer can be seen readjusting his grip, appearing to be holding on to the sides of the vehicle through open windows. 

The onlookers who filmed the outrageous incident continually expressed their disbelief at the man's ridiculous actions and the great speed at which the car was travelling. 

'They're going 70ks (kilometres)', one passenger in the car exclaimed.

Eventually the car turned off into what looked to be a residential area, and the video has already been viewed more than 85,000 times on Facebook.

Commenters were outraged at the 'stupid' actions of the young man, some suggesting he deserved to fall off and injure himself.

Many social media users were outraged by the video calling the car surfer an 'idiot'

This woman suggested he should take a walk through the spinal injury ward of a hospital to see what damage he could have done to himself or others

One man suggested he had seen many injuries from people's 'stupid' actions in his days as a paramedic

'Obviously the message is not getting through to some people, not only are they risking their own lives, but what if someone had fallen off and been run over! Bunch of idiots, let's hope this makes it to the police, we certainly don't need these tossers on our roads!!' one woman wrote.

'Is that supposed to be funny???? as a former Paramedic I find that behaviour more than stupid!!,' one man posted.

'Can we start cancelling people's Medicare at the same time they're fined for doing stupid things like this? Kind of tired of paying for other people's stupidity,' another commenter suggested.

Others hoped he had fallen and learnt his lesson, and some people even thought the stunt was funny, writing 'if they want to ride a car they do it at their own risk who are you to judge.' 

Some thought he deserved to fall off the car for his dangerous behaviour

Others said that he should have his Medicare card cancelled if he's going to take part in such 'stupid things'

This commenter was quite vindictive in his hopes for the car surfer

Others had less popular opinions saying the man should be left alone as he did it as his own risk 

Victorian Police have condemned the actions of not only the car surfer but the driver of the black vehicle, calling it 'stupid dangerous behaviour'.  

'There is no excuse for this sort of behavior on our roads. The driver of this car has not only put the life of the man clinging onto the roof of his vehicle at risk, he is also risking the lives of other road users,' Creina O’Grady, Victoria Police Media Officer told Daily Mail Australia.

'From the number of people who have reported these types of incidents recently we know the majority realise this is dangerous and stupid behaviour.

'However we also don't want people putting themselves at risk to take photographs of other drivers doing the wrong thing. Take details where you can and report it to police, and contact triple zero if you believe there is immediate danger,' Ms O'Grady continued.

'The driver in this incident could face serious charges including conduct endangering life and dangerous driving,' she added.
