A football player for the University of Kentucky has pleaded not guilty to first-degree rape.

Defensive lineman Lloyd Tubman pleaded not guilty Wednesday and is scheduled for a preliminary hearing later this month.

Tubman was arrested Tuesday for the Oct. 2 incident involving his alleged ex-girlfriend in a campus dormitory. His preliminary hearing will be Oct. 23. 

First-degree rape is a felony in Kentucky and Tubman faces up 20 years in prison.

Charged: University of Kentucky football player Lloyd Tubman was charged with first-degree rape

Alleged rape: The university has said that Tubman was arrested by campus police following an incident last week at a residence hall on campus

As Tubman appeared on video from Lexington-Fayette Jail, located several miles from Fayette District Court, Lexington attorney Jim Lowry, who has handled numerous cases involving Kentucky athletes, entered his plea.

Dressed in a standard-issue prison jumpsuit, Tubman said little and frequently hung his head during the brief proceeding. The Louisville native was released to his mother's custody after Judge Julie Goodman allowed 10% of his $10,000 bond, or $1,000 to be paid. He was ordered to have no contact with the woman.

Lowry and family members declined comment as they left the courthouse.

However, The Courier-Journal reported Tubman's mother Warnetta Smith Cooper wrote on Facebook 'Please don't pass judgment without the facts. My son (would) never hurt a female fly. Lloyd is not perfect but he's a good young gentleman.' 

Tubman, who hasn't played this season, has been suspended indefinitely by coach Mark Stoops. The university said in a release that the 6-foot-5, 225-pound Tubman is also subject to discipline under its code of conduct.

According to the arrest warrant obtained by The AP, the woman called campus police Thursday following the incident involving Tubman, who she described as her ex-boyfriend. The AP does not identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault.

Tubman called the woman around midday Thursday and asked to talk with her in her room. She initially refused, but signed him in as a guest after he told her he was in the lobby, the warrant said.

Multiple incidents: Tubman's arrest and suspension comes less than a week after four Wildcats players were charged with second degree disorderly conduct for their involvement in air pistol shots being fired near a campus residence hall

The warrant states that the woman began typing a paper on a bed opposite Tubman, who kept knocking a shoe off her foot with a water bottle. When she went to pick it up, Tubman pressed against her from behind.

The woman told Tubman they weren't going to have sex and returned to a roommate's bed. She later looked up to find Tubman naked. As she picked up his clothes and repeated that they weren't going to have sex, Tubman threw her on her bed and tried to undress her, the warrant said.

After resisting and threatening to scream if he didn't stop, Tubman tried to cover the woman's mouth with his hand and she bit him between the thumb and index finger. Tubman responded by biting her on the right shoulder blade, leaving a mark, the warrant said.

Tubman then forced the woman face-down on her bed and the rape occurred, the warrant said. She freed herself and ran to a closet but Tubman said he wasn't done; scared, she ran to the other side of the room, and fell, the warrant stated.

The warrant states that Tubman laughed, and then said, 'I'm done playin wit you.'

The woman told Tubman she had a class as an excuse to get him to leave. She signed Tubman out and security cameras show no interaction between the two, the warrant said.

The woman then called campus police, who collected physical evidence including clothing and towels. The woman was treated at UK Hospital's emergency room. 

Coach Mark Stoops appeared shaken when discussing the situation after Tuesday's practice, saying, 'Anytime somebody in our program has an issue like this, it's obviously a major concern. We just feel for all parties involved and we'll let the legal process go through its course.' 

The 19-year-old football player formerly played for Louisville Seneca High School. 

Stoops learned about the incident last Thursday and said 'It was a tough time as you could imagine. ... I'm not so much concerned for myself in that situation. But really, it was very difficult to meet with Lloyd and meet with his mother and to see somebody in your program hurting. I feel for all parties.

'It's obviously not a situation that anybody wants to be in.' 

Stoops also said Tuesday 'We constantly talk to [the football team] about things,' according to The Courier-Journal. 'Last week when we had the other issue, I addressed all issues, including this -- including sexual assault and any kind of assault and all those things. I addressed it at that time again. And we'll continue to do the best we can and educate these guys and help these guys and, again, coach them and teach them and mentor them, and we'll be there for them when they need us to.' 

On Monday, MailOnline reported that a quarterback for the University of Florida was suspended from the Florida Gators because of a sexual assault allegation.
