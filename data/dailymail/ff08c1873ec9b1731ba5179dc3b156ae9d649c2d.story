But there's no stopping fashion's most famous face.

And as well as posing like a pro for teh Italian feashion house the

Kate Moss is already back at work designing a new collection of smartphone cases for Carphone Warehouse.

Back to the day job: Kate Moss was hard at work this week designing her new smartphone cases for Carphone Warehouse

The 39-year-old met with the team to discuss her upcoming designs, which are geared towards 'fashion conscious smartphone users'.

Kate Moss’s latest career move is a bit more down to earth than her usual high fashion jobs.

Miss Moss, who has posed for exclusive designers including Chanel and Burberry, is working on the range for an undisclosed fee.

The collection, due to launch later in the summer, will ‘apply Kate’s sensibility to the latest handsets’, the retailer said.

The company recruited the 39-year-old 
model in a bid to cash in on what it calls ‘fashion tech’ – or phone 
accessories aimed at customers who ‘are crying out’ for something more 
stylish than cheap plastic cases.

For
Moss, it may lack the glamour of strutting the catwalks in Paris or 
Milan, but Carphone believes adding her touch to the humble phone case 
will tempt female customers who see her as a style icon.

Moss and husband Jamie Hince both sported gold Annina Vogel charm necklaces at Glastonbury this weekend, along with his-and-hers black jeans and wellies.

Julian Diment, marketing director, said Moss’s designs are inspired by her ‘favourite things’, adding: ‘She has been integral to the design process, raiding her jewellery box for inspiration on the charms.’

The company declined to disclose any details on how much the cases will cost, or on Moss’s fee.

New venture: Kate Moss will be designing smartphone cases for high street dealers Carphone Warehouse

A lucrative four year partnership with Sir Philip Green at Topshop, reported to have earned her more than £3million, ended in 2010.

She no longer acts as the face of Mango, the Spanish clothing chain, with Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr, a decade younger, starring in its latest campaign.

Although still a very high earner, Moss’s income appears to have been falling. According to an estimate of her wealth in American business magazine in Forbes last summer, she earned £6.3million in the previous 12 months, compared with £8.9m in 2010/11.

Moss said: ‘My phone’s as much a part of my look as my bag or shoes, and yet there’s so little choice out there.’
