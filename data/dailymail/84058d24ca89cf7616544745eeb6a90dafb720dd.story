Animal cruelty charges have been dropped in the case of a pig smuggled into the Gabba sports ground during the last Ashes series.

David John Gunn, 33, was charged with animal cruelty after a domestic brown pig was found with its snout taped shut and dressed as a baby in the Gabba stands in Brisbane last November.

The case was set to go to trial on Thursday but a prosecutor for the Crown told the Brisbane Magistrates Court no evidence would be offered against Gunn.

David John Gunn was cleared of all animal cruelty charges at Brisbane Magistrates Court on Thursday

The 33-year-old had been charged after a pig was found with its snout taped at the Gabba sports ground during the last Ashes series 

The case was struck out.

Outside court, defence lawyer Kate Clark said her client had always maintained his innocence in the face of 'significant public vilification'.

Mr Gunn has always argued that the pig was brought into the sports ground by someone else.

The pig named Ash was found dehydrated and stressed after being smuggled into the ground in a baby harness

This was later confirmed by police via CCTV footage according to the Courier Mail.

The pig named Ash was found dehydrated and stressed after being smuggled into the ground in a baby harness on day one of the first Ashes test.

Ash has since made a full recovery and has been adopted by a Brisbane couple.
