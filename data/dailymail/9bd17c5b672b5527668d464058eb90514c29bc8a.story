A holidaymaker staying at a Chinese hotel couldn't help but take a picture when he spotted posters telling guests how to use a Western-style toilet.

The signs, which illustrate the right and wrong ways for guests to go about their business, were posted in the loos of a hotel in Changde in the Hunan Province.

The instructions tell users to sit on the toilet, rather than squat on the edge of the rim, or spread their legs out wide or, in what must the the strangest instruction, not to carry out handstands.

How to: According to this sign, toilet users should sit rather than squat, do handstands or spread their legs

According to the Rocket News 24, which featured the sign after the unnamed guest posted them on a Chinese networking site, the man found it so funny that he started 'cracking up' and had to 'hold in his tummy for three minutes'.

The unnamed hotel responded to the guest's comment, saying: 'There are certainly people that would use the toilet by putting their feet on the toilet seat.  

'So, while laughing to your heart's content, be sure to follow the rules on how to use the toilet.' 

Toilets in the Far East are usually suitable for squatting, so it's not surprising that instructions were required to show users the right way to use a seated loo.

Other signs placed in toilets tell guests not to fish, perch on or stand up whilst using the loo.

Dos and don'ts: Whilst some instructions are obvious, there are others which are hard to understand
