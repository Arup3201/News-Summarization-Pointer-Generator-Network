A mother-of-three facing a mastectomy has had a plaster cast made of her chest - so she can remember how her breasts looked.

Tracey Stephenson, 50, was diagnosed with non-invasive breast cancer in September.

This is cancer which remains within the milk ducts or lobules in the breast and does not invade normal tissues within or beyond the breast.

Tracey Stephenson, 50, decided to have a plaster cast made of her chest before having a mastectomy

She had surgery to try and remove the cancerous tissue but it was unsuccessful, so she agreed to have a single 
mastectomy and reconstruction surgery.

Mrs Stephenson, a former business manager, knows she will never look or feel the same - but hopes the plaster cast of her breasts will be a comforting reminder of how she looked.

She also plans to have a second cast done once her surgery is completed to show other women how they can look after reconstructive surgery.

She said: ‘I'd quite like to keep the cast, not as a showpiece for my house, but something for just me to remind me that I'm still myself despite all the treatment.

‘They will look different after the reconstruction. I'll have to have surgery to try and make them look the same so it will be an on-going thing.

‘But it's important to deal with 
this. I won't let it beat me. I've got to get through this. I'm not 
going to leave my kids without a parent.

‘I found it hard to find out what they might look like after treatment and it was a worry.

‘I'm not looking forward to seeing what it looks like. That's the part that scares me the most.’

Mrs Stephenson, from Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, lost her husband Mike six years ago when he died at the age of 49 from a pulmonary embolism – a blockage in the artery that transports blood to the lungs.

She is a full-time carer for her father George, aged 88, and added: ‘I don't mind the surgery.

‘I'm not looking forward to the recovery as it will making being a carer quite difficult and I won't be able to drive for eight weeks.’

Keri Bird, 26, a plaster cast specialist and owner of Birds Body Casting, has made the cast.

She is doing the casts for women affected by breast cancer for free as part of a campaign to raise awareness.

Mrs Stephenson says she is not scared about having the surgery but that she is worried about what she will look like after she has had it

They will be decorated by artists and then put up in the windows of businesses in Bury St Edmunds before being put up for auction to raise money for breast cancer research and care.

Mrs Stephenson is planning on asking her family to bid on the cast of her breasts as a 50th birthday present to contribute to the fundraising for Suffolk Breakthrough Breast Cancer Group.

Ms Bird, also from Bury St Edmunds, said: ‘I have not personally been affected by breast cancer but doing this job I come across amazing people who have been directly affected.

‘The idea is to raise awareness and to say “this is my body and it's beautiful” and to encourage people to keep checking their breasts.’
