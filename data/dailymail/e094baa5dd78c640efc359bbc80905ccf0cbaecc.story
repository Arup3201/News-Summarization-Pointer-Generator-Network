At first glance you might think Vince Cable has adjusted pretty well to Mars' hostile environment.

Despite the chilly −63 °C temperatures and lack of oxygen, the MP appears relaxed, wearing just a suit and tie.

But the Secretary of State for Business is in fact visiting a test yard in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, designed to replicate Mars.

The new Airbus Defence Space ‘Mars Yard’ measures 98ft (30 metres) by 43ft (13 metres) and contains more than 300 tonnes of sand meaning engineers can test the next generation of vehicles destined to explore the red planet.

Europe's first Mars rover will be able to autonomously navigate up to 230 ft (70 metres) a day with no outside guidance from ground control.

The next generation ExoMars rover will be tested in the Mars Yard to give the Guidance, Navigation and Control team a chance to finalise its sophisticated autonomous navigation system.

Vince Cable said: 'The ExoMars rover represents the best of British high-value manufacturing.

'The technologies developed as part of the programme, such as autonomous navigation systems, new welding materials and techniques, will also have real impacts on other sectors, helping them stay on the cutting edge.

'Not only is it hugely exciting that Europe's next mission to Mars will be British built, but it is incredibly rewarding to see the benefits of our investment in the European Space Agency (ESA) creating jobs here in the UK.'

The facility was opened by Vince Cable as well as Chief Executive of the UK Space Agency, Dr David Parker and Director of Science and Robotic Exploration at ESA, Alvaro Giménez.

Dr Giménez said: 'A facility like this enables us to develop sophisticated navigation systems to “teach” Mars rovers how to drive autonomously across the Red Planet. This will be a fantastic resource for the ExoMars rover team and for future missions to come.'

The walls, doors and all interior surfaces are painted a reddish-brown colour mimicking the background colour on Mars, and the yard also includes a large mural of the Martian landscape.

These features ensure the rover navigation cameras see as realistic a Martian landscape as possible.

The Mars Yard will be used up until launch and will also be kept available after the rover has landed on the surface of Mars in 2019 in case engineers need to address any problem by simulating the situation on Earth.

Manufacture of the rover will begin early in 2015 after construction of an advanced clean room at Airbus’ Stevenage site and mission launch is planned for 2018.

Colin Paynter, Head of Airbus Defence and Space in the UK said: 'ExoMars is a hugely fascinating programme and the new yard brings us one step closer to launch.'
