The river of flames that has been making its way downslope on Hawaii's big island since June 27 is speeding up as it heads straight for a town of 1000 residents.

The continued lava flow from the summer crater eruption at Puu Oo was last clocked at a steady 705 feet per day.Now the progress has been measured at a far brisker 890 feet per day.

While the flow has now bypassed Kahoe homestead, directly in its currently path is the town of Pahoa.

The Hawaii County Civil Defense posted to its website: 'Currently the flow does not pose an immediate threat to area communities and area residents will be given adequate notice to safely evacuate should that be necessary.'

Speeding up: Moving at its current speed, scientists said the 300-foot-wide flow could reach Kaohe in close to two weeks

That could, however, change at any moment. Thankfully, due no doubt to the wet and dense vegetation 'there is no brushfire threat at this time and all burning is limited to the vegetation that is in direct contact with the flow.'

As of Tuesday, experts estimated that the flow was 19 days away from the main drag of Pahoa. 

However, that was at the previously measured speed. Now the lava could hit the town in closer to 15 days.

Residents and lawmakers fear that, beyond the main town road, the thick molten rock could reach Highway 705, which could cut off virtually all access to and from Hawaii's Puna District, notes the Star Advertiser.

Workers continue to prepare unpaved roads to be used as alternate routes in case lava crosses the highway. 

Path of destruction: The lava was moving at 890 feet per day as of Wednesday, leaving a path of destruction behind it. But scientists said surround forest was not burning

Unpredictability is a problem: The flow emerged June 27, but went underground for quite a while before returning to the surface in late August, with several disappearances and re-emergences since then

The direction and speed of the flow have also shifted slightly — though not for the better — since scientists began monitoring it.

Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Darryl Oliveira said lava has covered other major Big Island roads in the past, like a state highway in Kalapana and Chain of Craters Road which is partially in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.

The part of Highway 130 that could be cut off is used by 7,000 to 11,000 vehicles per day, he said.

Ghost town: Downtown Pahoa, Hawaii. Surf shop co-owner Tiffany Edwards Hunt said there ís a threat Pahoa could become a ghost town if lava from Kilauea volcano crosses roads connecting the village with the rest of the Big Island
