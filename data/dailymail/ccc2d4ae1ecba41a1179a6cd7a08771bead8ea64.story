Online shopping comes with a wealth of benefits – but its biggest flaw still remains the fact you can’t try items before you buy.

And with shop sizes ranging so drastically, you can be left with expensive or time-consuming returns.

Now a free Swedish shopping app called Virtusize is hoping to solve this problem by letting you directly compare clothes in your wardrobe that you know fit, with similar items online.

Swedish-based shopping app Virtusize directly compares clothes in your wardrobe that you know fit, with similar items online, pictured. Shoppers have to measure clothes first, but these measurements are stored in the cloud and can be accessed via any compatible website

When shopping on websites that have 
the Virtusize web app enabled customers can select an item of clothing and click the Virtusize button.

This opens the virtual wardrobe, 
and lets users lay the chosen item of clothing on top of 
existing items to see a direct comparison.

It shows how the length of the arms compare, where the waistline is measured, and the bust size, for example.

To
 add existing items to the app, take a tape
 measure and measure the garments at as many points 
as possible.

These 
measurements are then stored online. For example, the measurements 
for a favourite pair of jeans, dress, jacket or suit can all be uploaded
 and are kept in the cloud.

Each
 time a similar item is selected in an online store, shoppers can pull 
their existing items - and measurements - straight from the virtual 
wardrobe.

Once an comparison has been made, shoppers can also flip through the different sizes for that item without leaving the app.

When shopping on websites that have the Virtusize web app enabled – including Asos, Monsoon and Oasis – customers can select an item of clothing and click the Virtusize button.

By comparing items, pictured, customers can reduce the 23% of online purchases that are returned due to a poor fit

Virtusize said: ‘With sizes varying so much between retailers - a size 8 in Marks and Spencer may be equivalent to a size 12 in Topshop - it's vital that online shoppers having a way of being confident in clothing size as they do not have the luxury of using a fitting room.

‘Virtusize helps to solve the problem as it enables shoppers to visually compare the fit of clothing they already own and love with clothing they wish to buy.

'By comparing garment to garment directly, shoppers can be confident in how a new, untried garment will fit.’

The app is available on international versions of the retailers websites, and the measurements can be switched between centimetres or inches.

In a recent survey, 40 per cent of shoppers said they were still apprehensive about shopping online as they are worried about clothes fitting when ordered without trying them on first.

Additionally, the inability to ask a shop assistant questions when browsing online concerned 23 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds, but only 9 per cent of those 55 or over.

Almost a fifth of online purchases are returned due to a poor fit.
