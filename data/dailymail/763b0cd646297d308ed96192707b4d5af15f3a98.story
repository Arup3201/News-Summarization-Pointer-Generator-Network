The parents of a six-year-old girl with a growth disorder have pleaded with people to stop teasing their dwarf daughter - who at just 88cm is smaller than her two year old brother.

Jessica Ward rarely goes anywhere unnoticed and is often reduced to tears by commenting strangers.

The primary school pupil has achondroplasia, a bone growth disorder and a form of dwarfism, but her family say she is just like any other young child and have pledged to raise awareness about her condition.

Teased: Jessica Ward, 6, has achondroplasia, a bone growth disorder and a form of dwarfism and is often on the receiving end of jibes about her height which make her cry and (right) her seven year old brother Nathan towers over her

In
America, October brings a month-long campaign to raise awareness of the
condition her parents  Laura, 27, and Carl, 37, and brothers Nathan, 7, 
and two-year-old Ashley, are hoping to do the same in the UK.

Mrs Ward said the family would much rather people ask them about Jessica's condition and treat her like any other human being.

Plea for awareness: In America, October brings a month-long campaign to raise awareness of the condition. Her parents Laura 27, and Carl, 37, and brothers Nathan, 7, and two-year-old Ashley, are hoping to do the same in the UK.

She said: 'We have been to places like car boot sales where we'll be walking and you can hear people saying 'isn't she diddy'.

'When
you say that she is a dwarf, they apologise. We do not want them to 
apologise, we're not sorry. We just want people to think before they 
open their mouths.

'People should respect her for that, she just wants to be treated normally. 

'She is Jessica, she is six and can do everything anyone else can but she just may need a stool to stand on.

'She
does notice that she is different, she is wondering why her little 
brother is taller than her as well as all her classmates.

'It's
hard for her to understand, but we treat her the same as the other 
kids. She's a little person with a typical big six-year-old attitude.

'You
can still ask her to do something and she'll have a little strop and 
say 'no!'. But we discipline her just the same as the boys.'

Modifications have been made to the 
family home in Donington, Lincolnshire, to make day-to-day tasks easier for the youngster.

The
lights are controlled by sensors because Jessica can not reach the 
light switches, door handles have been lowered, the bathroom modified 
and she has a stair lift.

Mr Ward, a HGV driver, added: 'It's 
ignorance. All we want to do is make people aware of her condition. 
She's not a farce, she is a human being and she is our daughter.'

Despite
her family preparing for the worst after they were told Jessica would 
not live past one - she has bravely outlived those predictions and 
should now have a long life ahead of her.

Mrs
Ward said: 'For that first year, every time she got a cold or fell ill,
we thought is this it? But she's been a little battler and is just like
any normal six-year-old girl,

'She goes to Rainbows, after school art club and loves High School Musical.

'We take her swimming once a week and she enjoys that. She wants to be the next Rebecca Adlington.' 

Jessica
does have other health problems, including having a bladder a quarter 
of the size it should be, fluid on the brain, sleep apnea and bowed 
legs, but she manages these with regular check-ups.

Mrs
Ward said: 'When I was pregnant we didn't know anything about it. It 
wasn't until we went for a check-up and her head was measured that we 
found it was enlarged.

'When
she was 12 or 13 weeks old she was diagnosed with achondroplasia. The 
doctor told us she would not live past the age of one.'

As well as spreading the message of Dwarfism Awareness Month, the Ward family also hope to find other families affected by dwarfism.

Mrs Ward joked: 'Who knows, we might be able to find her a little boyfriend,'
