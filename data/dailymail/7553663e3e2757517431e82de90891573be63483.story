How do you make a newborn baby even more adorable? Dress him/her as an angel, cupid or a superbaby of course.

Photographer Neil Prahova has created a stunning range of portraits of infants in elaborate fancy dress. 

The 34-year-old places her tiny subjects in the middle of fantastical scenes depicting Mexican deserts, starry skies and sparkling seas.

Neil originally came to live in London after moving from Moscow in 1998 when she took up photography.

Each of the photographs require the babies to lie incredibly still in order for them to blend into their backgrounds.

To avoid any unwanted wriggling Neil photographs the tots when they are three to ten days old which is the time when they tend to sleep the most and therefore move the least. 

It also means that their limbs can be easily be positioned in the complicated poses while maintaining the comfort of the sleeping baby. 

When Neil originally started taking her photographs she says the scale was a lot smaller with less ambitious props.

Petite Prince: By photographing them at such a young age Neil is able to pose the baby's limbs more easily

Creative crab: It was after having her own children that Neil decided to get more inventive with her photographs

'I commissioned a lady who does professional knitting to knit a lot of baby hats, blankets and I also bought various other accessories, so now I have a whole collection for newborn and baby photography shoots.'

Neil, who describes herself as a mumtrepreneaur and is a mother herself meaning that she is incredibly engaged in her work 

'Babies are so unbelievably cute especially in those first days after being born' says Neil.

She says it was when she finally had her own children that she began attempted far more inventive photographs.  

'When I became a mother myself three years ago, I could feel my creative desires changing, urging me to use my new skills as a parent to create wonderful images that other new parents would treasure forever. 

Hanging around: Despite the serene appearance of her images Neil says that babies can be very uncooperative

Little angel: Many of Neil's photographs picture babies who have nodded off to sleep

Super baby! Neil first began photographing babies when she moved to London in 1998

'There is something magical about capturing an image, a small piece of reality, and turning it into an artifact of that moment in time.'

Despite the serene look of the images the photographer says that creating the images isn't always a peaceful process. 

'In order to make the photo good enough to honour that moment in time, some knowledge and practice is needed, and a lot of patience.

'The more you learn, the more you practice, the more natural it becomes. There's always something more to learn.

Sweet dreams: The sets for the images are created using fabrics and often a fleece background

Little cherub: Neil combines her experience as a photographer with her experience as a mother to create the perfect photograph

Flying high: Neil says that her photographs are a great way of capturing a baby's first days on the earth

'Kids never do what you want them to do – ask them to stand still and smile nicely and you'll invariably get scowls, creepy grins, and silly faces.

'I quickly discovered the best way to really capture your child is to photograph them in action.' 

Neil is not unaware of the fact that many people are capable of photographing their own babies however, she says that the service she provides is far more sentimental. 

'Many people have access to specialist cameras and photography equipment nowadays, but my shoots are as much about the experience as the end product.

Out of this world: In this inventive image Neil has used a paper plate to recreate a space helmet

Having a whale of a time: When she first started out Neil's photographs were far more humble with babies posing in knitted hats they have since got far more elaborate

'For many parents the shoots are the first time they've shown off their newborn to the world, and they want to capture such a special moment with a professional photo, captured by someone with a trained eye and plenty of experience.'

Neil says that it is her combination of personal experience and professionalism makes her photos so special.  

'Luckily, my lifetime spent as a photographer and my role as a loving mother puts me in a unique position to offer an unforgettable experience for parents – with a beautiful collection of photos they can take away.'

Out and about: Neil says that the babies are completely comfortable in her photographs
