A powerful nor'easter storm is battering the North East with torrential rains and up to two feet of snow - causing coastal flooding and travel delays from Delaware to Maine through Thursday. 

The storm has caused a massive tidal surge - more than three and a half feet in some places - that is flooding the Jersey Shore and parts of Long Island. A coastal flood warning remains in effect through this evening.

Intense, driving rain soaked residents along the Interstate 95 corridor all day. The rain isn't going to let up, either. More of the same is expected for Wednesday.

Commuters faced a difficult trek home as heavy rains and tidal storm surge flooded roadways in New York and other major cities. Elsewhere, snow and sleet turned roadways slick and treacherous.

The storm will dump up to five inches of rain on Boston, up to three inches on New York City and up to two inches on Philadelphia and Washington, DC. 

The rain turns to snow farther inland, with up to two feet falling on parts of Upstate New York. Buffalo could see up to 18 inches and Albany could get more than a foot. Most areas will see less than six inches, however. 

Most of the Interstate 95 corridor - including New York City and Boston - will not see snow.  

'There is a threat of sleet and freezing rain that could make for hazardous driving conditions for the morning commute,' Benjamin Sipprell, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Taunton, Massachusetts, said. 

'But it's that 1pm time frame that we are most concerned about with heavy rain and winds, and also the heaviest snow.'

High tide: The storm surge caused moderate flooding Tuesday in Stone Harbor on the southern end of the Jersey Shore

Streets in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, were flooded by the high tide - though the storm surge is expected to recede later this week

Slushy mess: In Liberty, New York, the nor'easter dumped wet, messy snow

The storm brought high water and flooding to the Outer Banks in North Carolina earlier this week. That storm surge is moving up the coast to the Jersey Shore and Long Island Sound Tuesday

The storm made for a sloppy, slippery Tuesday morning commute in parts of Massachusetts, where state police responded to numerous crashes and spinouts caused by icy roads, some involving their own cruisers. Authorities in Rhode Island reported 90 accidents.

With heavy rain falling, parts of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island were under flood watches.  

The wintry mix could turn to treacherous freezing rain in parts of eastern Pennsylvania. 

New Hampshire awoke Tuesday morning to light snow, freezing rain and sleet. To the south, New Jersey dealt with a soaking rain and the threat of coastal flooding from morning and midday high tides. Worsening conditions were expected as the storm winds up later Tuesday, and into Wednesday in northern areas. 

The nor'easter will also bring high winds, with gusts up to 55mph possible across the northeast.  

The weather is expected to delay flights at airports from Washington, DC, to Boston.    

More rain: Rain will continue to fall on the northeast throughout the day Tuesday into Tuesday night

The nor'easter continues on Wednesday - dropping more rain on New York and Boston and up to two feet of snow in mountainous areas of Upstate New York 

Clearing Thursday: The storm moves north and loses steam on Thursday - bringing clearer weather on Thursday - though no sunshine for New York

In Massachusetts, the storm is expected to bring mostly rain and strong winds to the eastern part of the state, but some parts of western Massachusetts could see 6 or more inches of snow on Tuesday.

Other areas, including New York's Catskills and Adirondacks, could get up to 2 feet of snow through Thursday before the plodding storm takes its leave.

The heavy, wet snow and gusty winds could combine to bring down tree limbs and power lines, causing outages.

In New Hampshire, which is expecting a mix of rain, snow and sleet, power companies were making preparations for the storm, which comes less than two weeks after nasty Thanksgiving weather knocked out electricity to more than 200,000 people.
