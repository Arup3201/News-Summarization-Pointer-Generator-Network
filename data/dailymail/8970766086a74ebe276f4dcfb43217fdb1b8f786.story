She has one of the most admired bodies in showbusiness and, at 43, is still showing off her toned physique in skintight outfits that women 20 years younger would struggle to pull off.

But fitness fanatic Jennifer Lopez has revealed that there was one moment in her life when she was delighted not to have a taut figure.

'When I got pregnant I remember watching my back, belly and butt grow and thinking, "I will never be the same again,"' she said.

'Then I remember right after the twins were born having that weird jiggly belly  - and kind of loving that. Because I earned that jiggly belly.'

The Dance Again singer, who turns 44 next month, gained around 50lbs when she was pregnant with twins Max and Emme, now five.

She told The Sunday Telegraph's Stella magazine it took her 'a whole year' to regain her famous figure.

The singer, a devotee of celebrity
trainer Tracy Anderson, came up with novel ways of  shifting the 
post-pregnancy pounds - including taking part in a triathlon six months 
after giving birth.

Jennifer was spotted looking in great shape on Friday while out promoting her new mobile phone company Viva Móvil, which caters specifically for Latinos.

Making sure all eyes were on her, the confident former American Idol judge chose an outfit which perfectly highlighted her feminine figure.

Bronx native Jennifer chose a white 
pencil skirt which clung to her shape in all the right places as she 
shot the advert in Brooklyn, New York.

She teamed the skirt with a hot pink blouse and towering nude heels which added to the glamour of her ensemble.

She also looked stunning at the amfAR gala wearing a skintight dress which showed off her toned figure on Thursday night.

J-Lo, who was at the the fourth annual amfAR Inspiration Gala at The Plaza Hotel in
New York, looked immaculate in the metallic blue gown - which has also 
been seen on British models Lily Cole and Liberty Ross.

To complement the outfit, Jennifer 
wore black mesh, open-toe heels and carried a black box clutch bag, 
keeping her jewellery to a minimum with just a few Harry Winston rings 
and small earrings to match.

Her
nude make-up design allowed the dress to speak volumes for her style, 
with her caramel blonde hair scraped back into a sophisticated 
pony-tail.

The former 
American Idol judge tweeted before the event: 'Change can happen when we
come together. Looking forward to tonight’s #amfARInspiration NY Gala 
to benefit #HIV #AIDS research!!!'

After the event, Jennifer tweeted: 'Beautiful evening #amfARInspiration! So humbled to be honored by these agents of change.'

Bringing
together famous faces from the world of fashion, music, cinema and 
more, amfAR hope to build AIDS awareness throughout the world.
