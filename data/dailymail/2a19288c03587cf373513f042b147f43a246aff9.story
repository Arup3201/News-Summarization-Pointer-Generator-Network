Shocking: 30-year-old mother of three Ashley Tull was arrested on drug charges after her daughter brought a pack-pack filled with 249 bags of heroin to her daycare

A 4-year-old Delaware girl brought a backpack filled with 249 baggies of heroin to her day care on Monday then passed it out to other children in the belief it was candy.

The girl took a different bag than usual to Hickory Tree Child Care Center after a household pet ruined her bag the night before. 

Day care workers immediately contacted police and even rushed some of the kids to a hospital as a precaution, but no injuries were reported.

According to WPVI, police were contacted just before noon Monday. They found the bag contained 3.735 grams of a white powdery substance.

Police say the substance, which was still enclosed in the bags, was removed by the teachers and immediately taken to the Selbyville Police Department where it was determined to be heroin.

It is not known how pure or how much heroin was in each of the 249 bags 

Police believe the bag belonged to the girl's mother, 30-year-old Ashley Tull. 

Tull was charged with maintaining a drug property and endangering the welfare of a child. 

Along with her 4-year-old daughter, Tull's two other children--a 9-year-old boy and an 11-year-old girl were left in the custody of a family member.

Tull was released on $6,000 bond.

Police continue to investigate the incident and said more charges could be filed.
