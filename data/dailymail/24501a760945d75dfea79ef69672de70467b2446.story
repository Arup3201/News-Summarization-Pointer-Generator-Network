Sunderland owner Ellis Short has upped the stakes in the North East rivalry by nominating three prominent personnel at Newcastle United to take part in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.

Short posted a video of his own challenge on Sunderland's youtube channel as centre-back pairing West Brown and John O'Shea douse him in water beside the Stadium of Light pitch.

However the real entertainment in the short video comes not from the suited Short screaming as he is drenched, but from his choice of nominations.

To the obvious delight and amusement of those filming the clip, Short targets his club's great rivals, calling on controversial Newcastle owner Mike Ashley to take the challenge.

Short then moves on to call out Newcastle manager Alan Pardew, before turning his attention to midfielder Jack Colback.

Colback, a Sunderland player from the age of eight until his move to Newcastle this summer, became a figure of some controversy when he decided to move across to St James Park. 

All three will now be expected to complete the challenge or donate to charity within the next 24 hours.
