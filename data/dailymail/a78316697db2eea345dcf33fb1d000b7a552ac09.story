Caroline Bailey, 46 (pictured with her husband Neal Connor), worked at Broad Oak High School in Bury, Greater Manchester, for 23 years but was found dead at a quarry after being bullied, an inquest heard

A senior RE teacher was found hanged at a quarry after claiming she was being bullied by other staff members at her secondary school, an inquest heard.

Caroline Bailey, 46, worked at Broad Oak High School in Bury, Greater Manchester, for 23 years but became stressed at work and began suffering panic attacks and insomnia.

The mother-of-two ended up taking sick leave and made several attempts to self-harm during the school's summer holidays, the inquest in Oldham heard.

She was later admitted to a psychiatric unit at Fairfield General Hospital, Greater Manchester. 

On the day of her death in September 2012, she told staff at the unit that she was going out to buy a newspaper but instead went to Castle Hill Quarry near Rochdale, where she was later found dead.

The inquest heard how the tragedy occurred after Ms Bailey was appointed head of humanities at the school, where she was described by the headteacher as an 'outstanding classroom practitioner' who 'always put children first.'

The hearing was told how she started talking about self-harm over undisclosed issues she had with a fellow teacher and was eventually prescribed anti-depressants.

She became so stressed that she began locking herself in her own classroom to eat lunch at the school instead of joining her colleagues in the staff room.

Her husband Neal Connor, 36, said she also began calling herself 'stupid' after a fellow teacher was promoted above her and said: 'I have nothing.'

Mr Connor, a recovery operator from Prestwich, said: 'She had been suffering from panic attacks while she was at work. She had felt them a couple of times while she was teaching.

'She had also felt the same sort of feeling when she had been in the presence of a couple of other members of staff as well, to the point that since December I noticed she had not been eating properly at home.

'She avoided going to the staff room on multiple occasions because she wanted her own time. She did not want to be in the presence of certain staff. She locked herself in her own class room for dinner.

'She had problems with members of staff at work and in my opinion it was a form of strategic bullying.

'There were ongoing issues from school and they were on her mind. She was made aware that a person was promoted above her position and she came out with comments like 'I have nothing,' and called herself 'stupid.'

In the months before her death, Ms Bailey was advised by her GP to seek counselling and also paid for her own hypnotherapy sessions.

However, she ended up going on sick leave and began self-harming during the school's summer holidays.

Neal Connor told the inquest in Oldham that he believed his wife Caroline (together above) was being subjected to 'strategic bullying' at the school. He said she called herself 'stupid' after a colleague was promoted over her

Following one instance of self-harm, her husband took her to A&E and doctors suggested that she be treated in a psychiatric unit at Fairfield Hospital. However, she begged not to be admitted as it was so close to the school where she worked.

Mr Connor said: 'When she got to Fairfield that night she looked like a frightened child. She said she wanted to be anywhere except there. When she walked from the ambulance she was frightened of seeing someone she knew - she looked through every single window to see who was there.

'There were some boys from the school sat at the entrance to Fairfield and her biggest fear was the fact that she had taught there for that long that some of the kids she taught at 15 would be 25.

'The biggest fear would be that they recognised her but she would not recognise them and that it would go out into the community that she was at that sort of ward.'

Following the treatment at hospital, Ms Bailey was allowed to return home for the weekend and appeared to improve.

However, three days before her death, her condition worsened when she began receiving text messages from a work colleague, the inquest heard.

Mr Connor added: 'There had been a lot of interaction that day with work colleagues who had been texting her. She struggled to reply to these texts.

'She had had several texts regarding work issues from a history teacher who was quite a close friend of hers. She was aware that Caroline had been pretty bad but not aware she was on a ward.

'They were lengthy messages and she struggled to reply to the messages and read through to make sure what she was writing made sense.

'She was fixated on work. There had been a promotion of a person she had problems with.

'When she first went off on leave, she was still scheduling work and work were contacting her. There were other teachers covering the lessons and she would see what they were doing but it was not sufficient for what she was happy with. She felt she was letting the kids down.

'At all times, whether it would be a female, man or child, or anyone around her at school, others would come first.

'She had a gift as a teacher and she was very much well-known for being able to take the most stubborn pupil and near enough turn them around her little finger. That was the way that she was. She was very much a loving, thoughtful person.'

After the weekend break, Ms Bailey returned to the psychiatric unit at Fairfield Hospital.

However, staff allowed out her to go out on September 2, 2012, to visit a nearby newsagents. 

When she failed to return to the ward, doctors rang her husband and he tried to call her mobile but  got no response.

She was found dead at the quarry a short time later.

At the inquest, coroner Simon Nelson said: 'It is clear Caroline had many qualities.

'She adored her children, she was a dedicated mother, a dedicated wife and dedicated teacher who cared about all of her pupils.

'She remained concerned about the work and welfare and success of her children. She also put others before herself. '

The inquest continues.
