Plea: Alistair Darling has made a last-ditch appeal to Scottish voters to oppose independence in tomorrow's referendum

This is it. Here we are. After two years of campaigning, criss-crossing the length and breadth of Scotland, only 24 hours remain before we make the biggest political decision of our lives.

The only question to ask yourself before you go to the polling booth is do you know what will happen if Scotland decides to break away from the UK. I certainly don’t.

Day in, day out, I have asked Alex Salmond questions. I have asked him what currency Scotland will use, who will pay Scotland’s pensions, if there will be a new border, if Scotland will be a member of the European Union. And if Scotland will be a member of Nato.

He has no answers. The campaign trail is littered with unanswered questions. Mr Salmond bluffs and blusters, he make assertions. And now, for the third time in this campaign, this week we find he has been deceiving us on, of all things, our National Health Service. It has been some saga.

First of all, he told us David Cameron could privatise the health service in Scotland. That is not true. Responsibility for health care in Scotland is completely devolved to the Scottish parliament. Mr Salmond is, in fact, the only person in Scotland who could privatise the health service.

Then we find the Scottish parliament is spending less than its budget allocation on health, so as health spending goes up in the rest of the UK, in Scotland it goes down.

Scotland’s spending priorities are decided at Holyrood, nowhere else. They could improve the NHS; they could invest more in the NHS; but they don’t. Instead, they have spent less on health in Government than their counterparts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

And as if that wasn’t bad enough, we now find health boards throughout Scotland are facing draconian cuts of around £450million. We were not meant to know until Friday, the day after Scotland went to the polls, but thanks to a leaked report we know now.

It is not a report drawn up by politicians, but by finance directors and Scottish Government officials.

How dare Mr Salmond try to deceive us, to let us vote on a false prospectus. But we should not be surprised. He has a track record.

When asked if he sought legal advice on Scotland joining the EU, he said he had. He spent taxpayers’ money going to court to stop the publication of that advice and then we found it didn’t exist in the first place.

And then, only last month, the Bank of England took the unprecedented step of publicly denying SNP claims that they had discussed plans for a currency union. The Bank said there had been no such talks.

I have been accused of scaremongering. It is not scaremongering to tell the truth. I don’t think it is scaremongering to ask questions. I think it is my patriotic duty.

Every pensioner in Scotland deserves to know how their pension will be paid. They need to know it will be safe.

At the moment, the UK guarantees the pensions throughout the UK. The costs are spread across 60million people. If Scotland breaks away, Scottish pensioners will be dependent on five million people in Scotland.

In the next few years, Scotland will have a bigger proportion of retirement age inhabitants and fewer people working than in other parts of the UK.

No matter how you look at it, the circle is hard to square. Where will the money come from?

Alex Salmond has said the SNP would be willing to pay pensions to people earlier if the UK breaks up. The independent experts at the Institute of Fiscal Studies have said a separate Scotland would face extra cuts of £6billion. That’s equivalent to nearly the entire pensions budget at present – far less unfunded promises in the future.

Whatever decision is made tomorrow, there is no going back. It is irreversible. Whatever the outcome, we can’t change our minds.

I hear people say this referendum is a battle between head and heart. Well, believe me, my head says No. But my heart says No too. For Scotland’s sake, for the sake of my children and their children.

Voting No does not mean there will be No change. All three main parties have pledged to deliver more powers for Scotland. It makes sense to give Scottish people control over our own daily lives while relying on the UK to secure the defence, prosperity and welfare of every citizen.

Scots have made a tremendous contribution to the UK’s success. We faced down fascism in the Second World War, standing alone for many months; we founded and built the most socially just health service in the world; and the UK had the strength to withstand the financial crash that crippled other countries.

If we stay together, the NHS will be safer, our pensions will be more secure, our schools, further education colleges and universities will be protected and there will be greater employment opportunities for our children and our grandchildren.

These are the issues I care about, and I believe the majority of Scots do too.

Most serious businessmen and women in Scotland want to stay in the UK. That is simply because they know what is best for business and what is best for jobs in Scotland.

Scotland sells twice as much to the rest of the UK as it does to the rest of the world. Around one million jobs in Scotland are linked directly to trade with the rest of the UK.

Our shipbuilders want to stay within the UK because they know the UK Government will not commission ships in a foreign land. Our farmers want to stay within the UK because they know their biggest market is in England.

Our manufacturers want to stay in the UK because anything getting in the way of trade, such as borders and different tax regimes, is bad for them.

Everyone’s vote tomorrow is crucial. It’s not like a normal election, where it only counts in your constituency. Scotland is one big constituency, so every vote counts the same.

Don’t let the Nationalists tell you otherwise. And don’t let them intimidate you either. They’ll try and make out that somehow a No vote is a vote against Scotland.

Over the last few weeks, some of their extremists have been too eager to throw around words such as ‘traitor’, ‘quisling’ and ‘slave’. Well, they won’t bully me. Don’t let them bully you either.

I don’t want anyone who wants us to stay in the UK to wake up on Friday morning, to turn on the TV or the radio and realise they’ve forgotten to act.

By then, it will be too late. A single vote could decide this referendum. One more for Yes than No and that’s it – the 307-year-old Union will end.

There is no second chance, no rewind button, no point complaining we didn’t know. This is our only chance.

So please act. I’m not exaggerating when I say Thursday is probably the most important day of our democratic lives.

From 7am until 10pm, Scotland and the UK will be in limbo, and everything which we have built over these past three centuries will hang in the balance.

For the sake of future generations, we should vote No tomorrow.
