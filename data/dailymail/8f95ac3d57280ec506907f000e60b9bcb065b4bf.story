It has no i-deer!

Post-Christmas shoppers at this Pennsylvania sporting goods store got more than they bargained for yesterday after a wandering deer walked through the front door.

The curious deer drifted into Dick's Sporting Goods in Reading about 2.30pm, weaving through the aisles before tripping over.

Oh deer! A shopper tackled this deer who wandered into Dick's Sporting Goods store in Reading, Pennsylvania yesterday afternoon

Store manager Brad Meyer said the deer slipped on the floor and a customer tackled it to the ground, preventing any injuries to shoppers or damage to outlet.

But it appears the disoriented creature didn't escape injury, with blood seen pouring from its nose.

The shop called the Pennsylvania Game Commission, which arrived and removed the deer.

There's no word on where the deer was released.
