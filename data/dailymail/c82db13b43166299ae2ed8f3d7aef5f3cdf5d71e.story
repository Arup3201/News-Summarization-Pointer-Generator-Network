A wheelchair padded with £370,000 of cocaine, endangered iguanas hidden inside sock and ill-fitting waistcoats with 30,000 cigarettes sewn into the lining.

These are some of the most bizarre - and idiotic - attempts to smuggle drugs, contraband and even reptiles into the UK as pictures released by border officials today show.

Other items stuffed with drugs included chocolate bars, children’s lollipops, carpets, a chapatti oven and ornamental monkey statues.
