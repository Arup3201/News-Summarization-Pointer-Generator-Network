A serial bride who had already married four times before she was 24 and even made a vow never to marry again tied the knot yesterday to her new partner, making it her fifth marriage at just 31.

Alison Smith had told her latest husband Matthew Hume, 48, that she was not proud of her previous marriages and would never marry again.

However, the mother-of-two from Arbroath arrived at the town's registrars in a knee length black and white frock for her close, family only, wedding ceremony in an apparent change of heart.

And it is likely she will be hoping her latest marriage fares better than her previous four.

The unusual wedding party contained Alison's mother Pat and her husband George Greenhowe. George was actually Alison's first husband in a marriage that only lasted 10 days.

The two families were torn apart when George ran off with Alison's mother.

However time healed the rift and they made up and reportedly even all lived in the same caravan together at one point.

Marriage One: She married George Greenhowe but their union only lasted 10 days after George ran off with Alison's mother Pat.

(George and Pat have since married in a humanist wedding- making George Alison's stepfather)  

Marriage Two: Alison was meant to marry Peter Knight but he got cold feet the day before the wedding and ran off.

His best friend Daniel Innes,18, 'stepped in' and married Alison instead.

Marriage Three: Having divorced Daniel due to 'family pressures', Alison married Willie McKellican.

She soon discovered he was already married. 

He was investigated by the police for bigamy but no charges were brought. Alison left him.

Marriage Four: Alison married Alex Shepherd, a friend of her first husband George.

He divorced her after discovering she was having an affair with Matthew Hume, 48.

Marriage Five: Alison and Matthew married yesterday at Arbroath town hall. The service was attended by family including her mother and stepfather and ex-husband George.  

George and Pat themselves tried to get married at a registrars office but were told because of the close family connections the law would not allow it. They were eventually married in a humanist ceremony with Alison as bridesmaid. She is now said to call her first husband 'dad'.

Alison's next try for wedded bliss was also to end in disaster.

In 2004, she was all set to marry fiancé Peter Knight, but Peter got cold feet on the eve of the wedding and called it off. Alison, who was eight months pregnant with her daughter, was despondent but, didn't let the grass grow under her feet.

She turned to friend, 18-year-old Daniel Innes, who agreed to step in as the groom. They were married four days later.

At the time she married Daniel, Alison said, 'I feel certain I've done the right thing by marrying Daniel.

'He makes me feel so secure. 

'When he heard Peter wouldn't marry me, Daniel said he would instead.'

However, family pressures resulted in that relationship falling apart and Alison was back in the divorce court and on the lookout for a new man.

Before long, the next potential husband arrived in Alison's life. She thought she had a bright future with Willie McKellican.

Marriage number 3: Alison at her third marriage with to husband William McKellican, who she later discovered was already married

Unfortunately for Alison, McKellican had a past that he had not revealed to her. He never told her that he was still married to his wife. He was investigated by the police for bigamy but no charges were brought.

Alison left McKellican after this revelation and she was on the hunt for a man again.

Marriage number 4: Alison Smith, seen here arriving for her last marriage to Alexander Shepherd in 2008, yesterday married for the fifth time

She married husband number four Alex Shepherd, a friend of her first husband George, but again that marriage was short lived.

He dumped her after finding out she had cheated on him with new love Matthew.

Alison said when she met her latest love, 'Matthew knows how many times I have been married in the past and he knows how I feel.'

As Alison woke up this morning from her wedding night, no doubt she will be hoping that new husband Mathew Hume will be around for longer than the rest.

When asked outside the wedding about their plans for the future the couple declined to comment.

Her first husband and now stepfather George Greenhowe said, 'She is happy and just wants to be left alone.'

Alison has now made peace with her mother Pat, pictured, and was even a bridesmaid at her wedding to George- Alison's first husband
