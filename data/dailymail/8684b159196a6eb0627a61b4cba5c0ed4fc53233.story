The owners of a Colorado cantaloupe farm behind one of the deadliest foodborne illness outbreaks in U.S. history have been arrested by federal authorities.

Jensen Farms, owned by Eric and Ryan Jensen, was revealed to be the source of contaminated melons that killed 33 people and sickened at least 140 across 28 states in 2011.

The Jensens, who went bankrupt in the wake of the contamination scandal, are charged with introducing adulterated food into interstate commerce.

'As this case so tragically reminds us, food processors play a critical role in ensuring that our food is safe,' U.S. Attorney John Walsh said.

'They bear a special responsibility to ensure that the food they produce and sell is not dangerous to the public. Where they fail to live up to that responsibility, and as these charges demonstrate, this office and the Food and Drug Administration have a responsibility to act forcefully to enforce the law.'

The Denver Post reports that federal investigators rarely pursue criminal charges against owners involved foodborne illness cases - and only if there is evidence that they knew of or ignored evidence of possible contamination.

There has been no public indication that there was such a lapse that led to the cantilope disaster as Jensen Farms two years ago, according to the Post.

It is unknown whether federal investigators have evidence of the Jensens ignoring information about possible contamination.Â

Instead, investigators have questioned the methods that the Granada, Colorado, farm used to cleaning the how fruit that was picked from fields.

At the time, federal guidelines were not clear on whether melons should be washing in a bath of sanitizing solution or simply sprayed off with fresh water.

The Jensens had upgraded their facilities prior to the outbreak to use the fresh water method.

However, investigators found that the process was originally meant to be used with potatoes and allowed dirty water to collect and re-contaminate the melons.
