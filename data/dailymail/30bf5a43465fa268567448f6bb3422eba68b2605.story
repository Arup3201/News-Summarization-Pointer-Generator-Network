With Luis Suarez the player in World Cup shame, Luis Suarez the manager took his cue to leave.

Honduras’s
 coach had only a remote chance of progression going into last night’s 
final Group E fixture and saw those prospects chewed up within six 
minutes by a man who might soon play for Liverpool.

Xherdan 
Shaqiri did the damage, producing the kind of wonderful attacking 
performance that is becoming rather common at this extraordinary World 
Cup.

Liverpool are understood to have opened preliminary talks with Bayern Munich over a £16million move for the midfielder and he illustrated the hype with two excellent first-half goals and a third after the break. With Switzerland through to the second round, that value might yet rise.

Shaqiri’s first goal, after six minutes, was quite brilliant. Juan Carlos Garcia had given Shaqiri too much time and space to turn on the edge of the Honduras area, but only so much blame can be apportioned to defenders when a ball is curled into the top corner from 20 yards.

Shaqiri's second perhaps relied more on Honduras’s deficiencies, but the finish was only marginally less impressive.

Victor 
Bernardez made a hash of cutting out a throughball, enabling Josip Drmic
 to take possession on the left before squaring for Shaqiri, who took 
two touches and sent Noel Valladares the wrong way. Great composure, 
lovely finish.

Honduras had chances of their own, most notably in the second half when Switzerland became complacent.

VIDEO Team Profile: Switzerland

After 51 minutes Jerry Bengston beat goalkeeper Diego Benaglio and had his shot cleared off the line by Ricardo Rodriguez. They were then denied what looked like a solid shout for a penalty 10 minutes later when Jerry Palacios was bundled over by Johan Djourou.

Just as Honduras appeared to have a foothold, Shaqiri finished from close range for his third.
