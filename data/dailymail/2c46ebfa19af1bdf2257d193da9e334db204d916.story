It might not be quite as well-known as its famous namesake in Surrey - but this Hampton Court is certainly no less impressive.

The stunning 26-bedroom manor house in Hope under Dinmore, Herefordshire, is not only set across 935 acres of land, but also has a fascinating history dating back to the 15th Century.

And now anyone who fancies saying they live in Hampton Court is in with a chance - as long as they have £12million to hand over.

Not that one! Hampton Court, in Hope under Dinmore, Herefordshire, which shares a name with the royal palace in Surrey, has been put on the market for £12million

The stunning 15th Century Medieval Castle is set on sprawling estate which covers
 935 acres of land, including farms, cottages, an orangery and landscaped gardens

The Grade I listed manor house was built after being ordered 
by Henry Bolingbroke, Earl of Hereford, who was crowned Henry IV in 1399 - not the same King Henry which built Hampton Court Palace

The whole estate is split into five lots, meaning the house could be 
bought along with a smaller portion of land - 74 acres - for a slightly more modest £4.5million

Unlike Hampton Court Palace in Surrey, the Grade I listed manor house and its sprawling estate of farms, cottages and woodland is up for grabs and could soon be lived in - albeit by a rather large family. 

And those with a more modest budget could still buy the castle - complete with a comparatively smaller 74-acre portion of land - for about £4.5million.

But, just like Hampton Court Palace, whoever it is that buys the property will be following a long line of historic owners.

The property was ordered to be built as a house by Henry Bolingbroke, Earl of Hereford, who was crowned Henry IV in 1399.

It was 
then granted by Henry IV to Sir Rowland Lenthall when he married Margaret Fitzalan, daughter of the Earl of Arundel and a cousin of 
the king.

Lenthall, who
 built the original quadrangular manor house in 1427, was then granted a 
licence to crenellate the property - which means he was allowed to fortify the house  - by Henry VI.

The house became a castle in 1434 and the interior has been revamped and redesigned by its different owners. It now has a heraldic theme throughout the property

When the castle was renovated by former owner Robert Van Kampen in the 1990s, the rooms were filled with an abundance of armoury, including a chandelier set with stag heads

The plush dining room boats a stunning chandelier, ornate curtains and 
thick wood-panelled walls which are in touch with the property's 
historic roots

Sir
 Rowland was succeeded by his daughter, who married the Baron of Burford. Their grandson then sold Hampton Court to Sir Humphrey 
Coningsby in 1510.

After that, Hampton
 Court remained in the Coningsby family, a prominent noble Herefordshire
 family, until the early 19th Century when the estate was purchased by 
Richard Arkwright.

He was the son of the famous inventor Sir Richard 
Arkwright, who rose from poverty to invent the spinning frame, which came to the fore during the Industrial Revolution.

Richard's son John then comissioned the remodelling 
of the house in the 1830s and 40s. The Arkwrights lived 
at Hampton Court until 1912.

The castle, which includes its own quaint chapel, pictured, was looked 
after by a line of aristocrats before remaining in the Coningsby family -
 a prominent noble Herefordshire family - until the 19th Century

It was then taken over by the son of the famous inventor Sir Richard 
Arkwright, who invented the spinning frame, which was used in the Industrial Revolution

In
 the 1990s, the house was revamped again by American owner Robert Van Kampen.

He spent millions restoring the crumbling building and introducing a heraldic theme - including a chandelier set with stag heads - to the castle.

Now the castle also boasts an ambitious garden, which is encased by Victorian walls. The gardens include stunning
 flower displays divided by canals, island pavilions and 
pleached avenues.

The grounds include a waterfall in a sunken garden, pictured left, among the vast lawns and beautiful trees, which look out over woodland and fields

The landscaped gardens include a maze, a flower garden divided by canals 
and an ornamental kitchen garden of fruit and vegetables, used to supply
 produce to the orangery, which is housed in the conservatory built in 1836

The sunken garden, left, is accessed through a 150-year-old wisteria tunnel, which is covered with draping trees and leads to the castle's stunning gardens

Today, the
 kitchen garden is full of organic fruit and vegetables used by the orangery restaurant, which is housed in a conservatory attached to the property in 1836.

Just like Hampton Court Palace, there is also a maze with a gothic tower at its centre, from where there is a panoramic view over the estate.

There
 is also a 150-year-old wisteria tunnel that leads to a waterfall in the
 sunken garden, as well as vast lawns and ancient trees.

The house also featured in the BBC TV Series Survivors, a post-apocalyptic series about people who had survived a plague, which aired in the 1970s.

Many parts of the first series were filmed in and around the house, which was empty at the time.

Arguably the country's most famous Hampton Court is the royal palace based in East Molesey, Surrey.

Hampton Court Palace has not been lived in by the British Royal Family since the 18th Century but, along with St. James's Palace, it is one of only two surviving palaces out of the many owned by King Henry VIII.

It was originally built for Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, a favourite of King Henry VIII, in 1514. But fifteen years later, when Wolsey fell from favour, the palace was passed to the king, who enlarged it.

The next century, King William III's rebuilt and expanded the castle, in an attempt to rival the revered Palace de Versailles.

But work was stopped in 1694, before the project was completed. It left the palace with two distinct styles - Tudor and Baroque - which still remains to this day.

Today, the palace is open to the public and is a major tourist attraction. The palace is cared for by an independent charity, Historic Royal Palaces.

The palace's Home Park is the site of the annual Hampton Court Palace Festival and Hampton Court Palace Flower Show, which is renowned around the world.
