The Air Force's former chief prosecutor has claimed he was 'put out to pasture' after he criticized top commanders for overturning a high-profile sexual assault conviction.

Colonel Don Christensen says he was transferred to a less meaningful role and given a 'downgraded' personnel report after he spoke out against the military's handling of a 2012 case.

Christensen, who served as the top prosecutor for four years, decided to step down and join a victim advocacy group, Protect Our Defenders, last month - explaining that the military criminal justice system was 'fundamentally broken' and could not be fixed from the inside.

Now the retired colonel has spoken to Yahoo! News about the case that ended his military career.

Battle: Colonel Don Christensen stepped down as the Air Force's chief prosecutor last month after claiming he was downgraded for criticizing commanders who overturned a sex assault conviction

In November 2012, Christensen, who worked on 300 sexual assault cases in the Air Force, successfully convicted Lieutenant Colonel James Wilkerson of aggravated sexual assault.

Wilkerson, a F-16 pilot and the inspector general of Aviano Air Base, Italy, had been accused of sexual assault by civilian physician Kim Hanks five months earlier.

Hanks and other workers had gone to Wilkerson's house for a small party after a concert at the base, and when Hanks was stranded without a ride, Wilkerson and his wife, Beth, suggested she stay in their guest room.

She was awoken at 3am by pain between her legs and realized Wilkerson was touching her. As she attempted to get him away, his wife appeared at the door and shouted: 'Get the hell out of my house.' She left immediately.

After Wilkerson was convicted, he was sentenced to a year in jail, dismissal and pay forfeiture.

He protested his innocence and just three months later, Lieutenant General Craig Franklin, a base commander, quietly concluded that the evidence was insufficient and threw out the verdict.

Denial: Wilkerson, a married father, denied that he had assaulted Hanks and three months after his conviction, it was quietly overturned by a commander. Christensen called it 'the final straw'

Christensen, who said that Hanks was one of the most credible witnesses he had ever worked with, said that neither he nor Hanks were not notified about the decision.

'My reaction was that this was the final straw, that we were going to lose military justice, that Congress would be outraged, I was outraged, and that this was the death knell to the justice system as we knew it,' Christensen told Yahoo! News.

Decision: Lt. General Craig Franklin, pictured, decided to throw out the pilot's conviction

After his complaints, he received a 'downgraded' personnel report before he was removed from his position, he said.

He was given a role as a judge on an Air Force appellate court. He said this was a less meaningful position and he had never applied for it, Yahoo! reported.

'When I got my performance report, I knew they were sending me a message that - they didn't want me in the Air Force anymore,' he said. 

His bosses at the Air Force have denied this is the case, insisting that the change in positions was part of the normal rotation.

Wilkerson's lawyer has also accused his alleged victim of lying about aspects of the case. Franklin had called the pilot a 'doting father and husband' when he threw out the conviction. 

Christensen counters that the victim's account was '100 per cent consistent'.

'I felt like I was going to pay a hell of a price' for speaking out, he said - which he just doesn't understand. 'I feel like I'm being loyal to the Air Force by helping us solve a huge problem,' he said.

When he stepped down last month, he released a statement detailing his decision, the Air Force Times reported.

'I watched at least 30 commanders come to the defense of Wilkerson ... and blatantly attack the prosecution, judge, investigators, and the jury,' he said. 'I realized that in order to see substantial change, I would need to leave the Air Force, breaking a military tradition that has been a part of my family for over 150 years.' 

Support: Senator Kirsten Gillibrand speaks in support of the passage of the Military Justice Improvement Act last year. Christensen is now supporting her bill for an independent prosecution office in military cases

Wilkerson was later reduced to the rank of major and he was then kicked out of the service when officials learned he had fathered a child with another woman while he was married.

Franklin, the commander who overturned the conviction, retired in January.

In the aftermath of the case, the law changed and now convening authorities like Franklin cannot overturn sexual assault convictions. But commanders still make the decision as to whether sex crimes should be prosecuted.

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has now proposed legislation to create an independent prosecution office in the military and remove commanders from taking part in prosecution decisions.

Christensen will appear at a Capitol Hill press conference on Tuesday to support Gillibrand's bill.
