Sexual deviance, regardless of its truth, has already brought down Herman Cain. But Newt Gingrich is so far holding up stronger than his fallen rival.

However now an ‘ex-mistress’ has told the National Enquirer that the GOP presidential candidate, who cheated on two previous wives, is a ‘hypocrite'.

Anne Manning claims she performed a sex act on him in his Washington D.C. hotel room while he was still married to his first wife Jackie in 1977.

‘He always talks about being big on family values but he doesn’t practice what he preaches,’ Ms Manning told the National Enquirer.

‘I wasn’t planning to say a word about him, but voters need to know what sort of man they’re being asked to support,’ the businesswoman added.

Ms Manning, who was on his congressional campaign, claimed they did not have intercourse because then 'he could say he had not slept with me'.

‘If Newt acted in the way Anne alleged, his behaviour is consistent with sex addicts,’ sex addiction expert George Collins told the National Enquirer.

Number three: In the mid-1990s, he began an affair with House of Representatives staffer Callista Bisek, who is 23 years his junior. They married in 2000

New York psychologist Judy Kuriansky said sex addiction is usually treated by separating the patient from harmful sexual behaviour.

Many critics of the former House Speaker say he still has to convince doubters who say his personal past makes him unfit to become President.

These details may been brought back to 
light as part of a smear campaign from opponents of the man who could 
take on Barack Obama for the presidency next year.

He has said voters should look to the 'strong marriage' he has with his current wife Callista and consider the 'forgiveness' he sought from God.

Mr Gingrich married his first wife Jackie Battley, his former high school geometry teacher, in 1962 when he was 19 years old and she was 26.

Second wife: Mr Gingrich married Marianne Ginther in 1981, six months after his divorce with his previous spouse was finalised

They had two daughters, Kathy and Jackie. But in the spring of 1980, they split after he had an affair with Marianne Ginther.

He is said to have demanded a divorce from Ms Battley while she was in hospital for cancer treatment, but has always disputed this.

Ms Ginther went on to become his second wife in 1981, six months after his divorce with Ms Battley was finalised.

In the mid-1990s, he began an affair with House of Representatives staffer Callista Bisek, who is 23 years his junior. They married in 2000.

Mr Gingrich was first elected to Congress from Georgia in 1978 and rose to the second spot in the House Republican leadership.

He was instrumental in helping to craft the 1994 Contract with America - a conservative blueprint that helped the GOP take control of the House.

He then became House speaker, but after a disappointing GOP showing in the 1998 congressional elections, Mr Gingrich retired in 1999.

Mr Gingrich has performed very well in the polls of late, opening up a huge 15-point lead against his biggest rival Mitt Romney earlier this week.
