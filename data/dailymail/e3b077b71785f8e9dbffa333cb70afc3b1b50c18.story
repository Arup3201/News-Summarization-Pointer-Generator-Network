Former German international goalkeeper Tim Wiese make his WWE debut on Saturday night, in one of the most sensational career changes by a professional sportsman.

Wiese, who only retired from professional football this year, when Bundesliga club Hoffenheim decided not to renew his contract in January, stepped into the ring for the first time just 10 months later.

But he is not the first ex-footballer to leave the game for slightly strange second career. Sportsmail brings you the top 10...

Eric Cantona - Actor

Footballers going into acting isn't exactly unheard of - who can forget Vinnie Jones' performance in Mean Machine?

But no-one can quite compare to 'The King'. A tortured genius on the pitch, as famous for his kung-fu kick on a fan as his sublime goals for Manchester United, Cantona is the master of French suave.

Since retiring from football the Manchester United legend has had a reasonably successful film career

Cantona is famous not only for his sublime skills, but also for the occasion when he kicked a fan

Since appearing alongside Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush in Elizabeth in 1998, Cantona has gone on to star in English and French films, as well as some wonderful adverts for Nike and Kronenbourg.

He also captained France's beach football team on the side. A true polymath.

David Icke - Writer

Despite retiring from football in 1973 at the age of 21, when a knee injury cut his career short, Icke continued in sport until 1990 as cohost of the BBC's Grandstand.

However, after his broadcast career was cut short following his public objections to Margaret Thatcher's poll tax, the former goalkeeper changed direction, getting in touch with his spirituality and becoming a writer.

Icke had a long career as a sports broadcaster before moving on to more controversial jobs

A conspiracy theorist who is never one to shy away from speaking his mind in a controversial manner, his website claims he is a 'British author [who] exposes the reptilian bloodline that rules the world.'

Ray Wilson - Undertaker

The oldest member of England's 1966 World Cup winning squad, Wilson is often regarded as one of the greatest full backs the country has ever produced.

He played in all six games during England's World Cup winning campaign and the semi-final against Portugal marked Wilson's 50th international cap.

His career continued until the early 1970s, but despite a brief spell in management, Wilson decided to leave the game completely, building a successful undertaker's business in Huddersfield. 

He retired from this career in 1997, and five years later sold his World Cup winners medal for £80,000.

Jose Manuel Pinto - Musician

Plenty of footballers love their music - Petr Cech and Wayne Rooney have shown off their talent in the last few weeks alone.

But former Barcelona keeper Pinto does more than the odd open-mic night that gets uploaded to youtube - Barca's long-term No 2, who goes by the stage name Wahin, is now a professional music producer, and the founder of a charity.

Jose Manuel Pinto was never a first-team regular at Barca, but he was an important squad member

Pinto (back, centre) won two Champions League titles as Barcelona's back-up goalkeeper

Ve A Por Tus Suenos, or Go for your dreams, seeks to 'inspire, motivate, teach values and spread optimisim to the world through music'. 

With four La Liga titles, two Champions League winners medals, and two World Club Cup successes to his name, you wouldn't bet against him succeeding in music as well.

Gaizka Mendieta - DJ

A decade at Valencia, where he was twice a Champions League runner up - and both times voted the competitions best midfielder - a season at Barcelona, 40 caps for Spain. And of course four seasons with Middlesbrough.

Gaizka Mendieta was a genuine star of the late 1990s and early 2000s, but off the pitch he also had a secret life as a DJ.

Sportsmail met Gaizka Mendieta last month. Read what he has to say on football, music, and life after retirement. 

'If I played on Saturday I would then sneak into the club, but it was always off the record, I would wear a hat and go in disguise,' Mendieta told Sportsmail earlier this year.

'I would then DJ and no-one would know it was me. I loved it. It was an escape.’ 

Andriy Shevchenko - Politician

In England, Shevchenko is mostly remembered as the expensive flop who failed to live up to his reputation on the continent. 

But in Ukraine, the striker is a national hero. After leading Dynamo Kiev to the Champions League semi-final in 1999, Shevchenko departed for Milan where he scored 127 goals in 208 Serie A games. 

On the international stage he is Ukraine's leading ever goalscorer, and was offered the chance to coach the national team, but turned it down.

Instead, the striker decided to turn his hand to politics, standing in the 2012 Parliamentary elections for the Ukraine - Forward! party. 

However, his political career, thus far at least, is more like his time at Chelsea than Milan - Shevchenko's party secured just 1.58% of the votes, and he was not elected. 

Thomas Gravesen - Poker player

There are countless stories of professional footballers who lose all their money after their careers, and end up have to work just to get by.

Gravesen is not one of those players. The former Everton hard-man, who was a cult figure even before his surprise move to Real Madrid, has does remarkably well since retiring from football.

Gravesen was known for his tough-tackling - now he has a rather more gentle lifestyle

The Danish ex-midfielder invested his career earnings in a number of businesses, and cashed out at just the right time. 

Now living in Las Vegas, with a personal fortune of over £80m, Gravesen is in a relationship with a Czech model and plays poker in his spare time.

It's a hard life. 

Kevin Kyle - Storeman on a ship

Once a Premier League striker and a Scotland international, Kevin Kyle now works on a 'floating hotel' for workers in the oil industry in the Shetland Islands.

Kyle has not officially retired but has been without a club since leaving Ayr United, and now works 12-hour shifts on the ship where he cleans floors, makes beds and replenishes stocks.

The Stranraer-born Scot is a reformed gambler who once admitted to spending £7,000-a-week on betting. He has since given up time to warn young footballers about the dangers of gambling.

At the peak of his career Kyle was earning £10,000-a-week - equating to more money per day than he is now earning each fortnight. 

Tomas Brolin - Ecclectic businessman and Poker player

Best remembered in this country for a stunning goal against England, and a dire three years at Leeds United, Tomas Brolin was an exceptional talent.

A genuine star for Parma and Sweden in the early and mid-1990s, his career fizzled out somewhat after his move to Elland Road.

After moving to England Brolin's career took a turn for the worse, and he retired at the age of 29

But Brolin was to have renewed success after retiring at just 29 years old. After returning to Sweden, he ran several businesses, in various fields: catering, shoes, vacuum cleaner nozzles and skin care, to name a few. He owned four race horses, and even opened a restaurant.

Then, in 2006, the Swede turned his attention to professional poker, and though he has never reached the same heights at the table as he did on the pitch, he has placed highly at a few big tournaments.

Bixente Lizarazu - Brazilian Jiujitsu fighter

Very few men can say they have completed the World and European championship doubles. Even fewer can say they've done it across two sports.

Lizarazu is one of those men. A World Cup winner with France in 1998, and European Champion two years later, the full-back was part of one of international football's most successful teams ever.

Then, after retiring in 2006, the defender turned to Brazilian Jiujitsu, where he showed an incredible natural aptitude.

Just eighteen months after taking up the sport, the Frenchman became blue belt European Champion in the senior lightweight division - the first competition he had entered.

'It's a beautiful experience,' says Lizarazu. 'It's one against one. You haven't got your friends behind your back to support you like in soccer.'
