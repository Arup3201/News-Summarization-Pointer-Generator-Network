The story of Lady Godiva’s naked ride through the streets of Coventry has been a cornerstone of British folklore for 1,000 years.

But now a Belgian chocolate manufacturer has sparked outrage by claiming it has exclusive rights to both her name and the famous image of her on top of a horse.

The situation was exposed when lawyers acting for the confectionery giant fired a warning letter to a pub called The Lady Godiva last week, warning that it was infringing on its ‘intellectual property’.

Owner Glen Simons was given a 90-day ultimatum to change his bar’s name and remove all references to the 11th Century noblewoman, whose daring protest at oppressive taxes has become the stuff of legend.

Historians reacted with shock that her name had been allowed to fall into the hands of a foreign firm without anyone apparently noticing.

Colin Walker, vice-chairman of the Coventry Society, said: ‘This is an absolute travesty. No one should be allowed to hijack the identity of historical figures for their own commercial interests.

‘When I was in Belgium recently I thought it was a bit of a cheek that they were selling chocolates with Lady Godiva on the box, but I never thought it would come to this.

‘If the Belgians try to enforce this in Coventry, there will be angry protests. We are very proud of Lady Godiva, and she is known and loved around the world.’

The Mail on Sunday has discovered that Godiva Chocolatier successfully filed a patent on Lady Godiva’s identity in 2007. It appears on the register of the Intellectual Property Office in London, the official body for trademark applications, alongside several versions of the woman-on-a-horse image.

Legal experts said it would have been relatively easy for the company to stake its claim for a fee of about £1,000. It would have no obligation to consult interested parties before going ahead.

Mr Simons, who set up his British-themed pub in Geneva seven years ago, was warned that its name might cause ‘confusion’ with the confectioner. 

But he said: ‘My pub has nothing to do with chocolates so I don’t see how anyone could be confused.’ The 55-year-old, who was born in Britain but moved to Switzerland for family reasons, said he would fight the legal threat in a David-and-Goliath battle.

‘I wanted to name the pub after a woman who was part of England’s heritage and I could think of no one better or more famous than Lady Godiva,’ he added.

‘As well as the sign outside, we’ve got her name engraved on the windows and front door. It would cost a fortune to remove them. My regulars are absolutely furious. I am not going to back down. This has been the Lady Godiva pub for seven years and that’s how it’s going to stay.’

Godiva was the wife of Leofric, Earl of Mercia, and the story goes that she went naked to protest against her husband’s taxes on his tenants. The term Peeping Tom originates from a tailor who was reputedly struck blind after ignoring a decree that no townsfolk should watch her feat.

The Belgian brand is actually owned by Turkey’s Ulker Group, which paid more than £500 million for the company in 2007. Managers at its Brussels headquarters refused to disclose how many other Godiva-named businesses had been sent warning letters.

In a statement last night, marketing director Adele Santarelli said: ‘Godiva is one of the world’s most well-known brands with a unique reputation, heritage and name. 

In addition to our chocolates and the shops that sell them, we also have a growing line of Godiva cafes. Clearly, it is important for us to ensure that consumers are not confused by a place serving food and drink using the Godiva name and imagery when that place has nothing to do with us.’

But this explanation cut no ice with Pru Porretta, who has taken the role of Lady Godiva in annual processions commemorating Coventry’s most celebrated daughter.

‘The Draps family, who founded the Godiva company, came over here to see the parade years ago and fell in love with Lady Godiva,’ she said. 

‘They sell their chocolates with a leaflet in the box which is supposed to tell the story but it’s full of mistakes. It’s so sad to hear they are trying to keep the name to themselves. It doesn’t leave a sweet taste in the mouth, does it?’
