Her famously quirky dress sense and luscious blonde locks have garnered her as many admirers as her acting abilities.

Now Kirsten Dunst has become the first ever international spokesperson for salon haircare brand, L'Oréal Professionnel and appears with artfully rumpled hair in the first promotional shot for the French beauty giant.

And more are set to follow with the actress due to front three beauty campaigns for the French haircare brand in 2014 and will star in a series of ads for their styling ranges: Tecni-Art, Beach Waves and Absolut Repair Limpidium.

Speaking about the new signing, Anne-Laure Lecrerf, L'Oréal Professionnel's international managing director, explained:

'Kirsten Dunst has a timeless beauty and
 is a modern woman, closely connected to fashion. She has a strong 
personality and makes her own choices.

'Her great professionalism and 
commitment to excellence make Kirsten one of the talented actresses I 
have ever met.

'She has the perfect attributes to embody the new values 
of L’Oréal Professionnel.'

The move marks a welcome return to fashion for the blonde, who landed her first modelling job at the tender age of three and later and later signed with Ford Models and Elite before making a name for herself in Hollywood.

Kirsten, 31, commented: 'I feel very close to L'Oréal Professionnel. The brand is strongly connected to fashion, and I admire its commitment to innovation, constantly creating new professional services and products to achieve the most on-trend styles.'

The 'Melancholia' star, who previously fronted ads for Bulgari's fragrances, has experimented with a host of different hair colours and cuts in the past, making her the perfect fit for the haircare brand.
