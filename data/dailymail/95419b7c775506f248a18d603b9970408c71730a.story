Motorola officially unveiled its ‘budget’ Moto G handset in Brazil yesterday, with hopes of capturing the emerging markets.

The £135 Moto G is a 4.5-inch handset running the latest version of Android and will launch across Latin America, Europe, Canada and parts of Asia in the coming weeks.

A notable omission in the rollout plans, however, is China - a region that Apple recently considered important enough to include in its iPhone and iPad release, but one that has a chequered past with Motorola's parent company, Google.

The budget Moto G handset, pictured, was unveiled during an event in Sao Paulo, Brazil. It has a 4.5-inch screen, 1GB RAM, runs on a 1.2GHz quad-core processor and comes with 8GB built-in storage. It also has a 5MP camera

Screen size: 4.5-inch

Pixels-per-inch: 329 PPI

Camera: 5MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing

Basic storage: 8GB and 16GB

UK Price: £134.95 for 8GB and £159 for 16GB

U.S Price: $179 for 8GB and $199 for 16GB

Speaking at the event, Motorola's CEO Woodside said: 'Most people in the world can't afford a $500 or $600 phone.

'The average price is close to $200 and the experience of these devices is really, really bad.

'We
think the industry should deliver more value, we think people deserve 
better. So that's why today, we're introducing Moto G.'

The firm chose Brazil as the first country on its rollout schedule because the South American region is seen as an important emerging market for smartphone makers.

It is seen by many to be as significant as the emerging markets of China.

Apple certainly believes China is a lucrative country after the tech giant made its new iPhone 5S and 5C phones, as well as its new iPad Air, available in the region from launch for the first time ever. 

Yet Google, which bought Motorola last year, has had previous run-ins with the Chinese government over censorship concerns.

China heavily censors the web, across the country, and up until March 2010 Google adhered to some of these laws.

However, since then it has spoken out
against the restrictions, and after talks with the Chinese 
government broke down, Google began redirecting people who visited its 
Chinese site to its Hong Kong service.

A move that was criticised by the 
Chinese government. The country and the company continue to disagree on 
the matter and its thought this rift may have been the reason why China
was not included in the Moto G plans.

The Moto G is set to be a cut-price 
alternative to the firm's Moto X handset, released in August, yet 
reports claim the firm has sold just half a million of these high-end 
phones meaning there's a lot resting on the success of the Moto G.

Success that could be hindered further by the fact Motorola won't be selling in China. 

By comparison, rival Samsung shipped more 10 million Galaxy S4s in the same period.

This may be due to the fact Motorola’s 
Moto X is only available in the U.S., while Samsung’s model is available
worldwide, yet the Moto X is $100 cheaper than the $699.99 S4.

When
compared to these Moto X prices, the £135 Moto G is ‘cheap’, yet there 
are other similarly priced smartphones on the market, including the 
Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini, the HTC Desire X and Nokia’s Lumia 520 with 
similar features.

The
Moto X's poor sales follow reports in the summer in which Motorola 
announced losses of $342 million in just one quarter - a 34 per cent 
drop compared to same period in 2012.

It has 1GB RAM, runs on a 1.2GHz quad-core processor and comes with either 8GB or 16GB of storage built in. 

The Moto G has a curved back, designed to fit comfortably in the user's hands, and the edge-to-edge display as seen on the Moto X.

In what seems to be becoming a trend,
the majority of the Moto G's details were leaked before the 
announcement, including a post appearing on Amazon earlier this week.

The leaks revealed the size and price of the device, as well as hinted at the different coloured cases.

The customisable colourful design of the Moto G was originally seen on the Moto X due to the Moto Maker.

When customers in the U.S. order the phone they can fully customise by choosing from a list of tones and colours. 

Motorola initially said customers would be able to engrave their new Moto X handsets, but this option was removed at launch.

Moto
G goes on sale this week in Brazil and parts of Europe and will be 
available within the next few weeks throughout Latin America, Canada and
parts of Asia.

It will be available in the U.S., India, the Middle East and more of Asia in early January.

Google-owned Motorola has also taken its lead from Apple by offering the Moto G in a variety of colours, with interchangeable cases - or Motorola shells, pictured. The customisable colourful design of the Moto G was originally seen on the Moto X due to the Moto Maker

The phone costs £134.95 for 8GB and £159 for 16GB in the UK. In the U.S., Moto G will be sold for $179 with 8GB of storage and $199 for 16GB.

David Phelan, Mobile Technology Advisor at Carphone Warehouse, told MailOnline: 'The Moto G offers plenty of bang for not many bucks - in fact, it’s the cheapest quad-core device on the market.

'It’s ideal for someone looking for all the latest functionality without the wallet busting price tag associated with many smartphones and is likely to be a very popular gift this Christmas.'

The Moto G will be available from Carphone Warehouse from 11 December for £149 on Pay As You Go.

While Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com added: ''Rather than having to wait for 
hand-me-downs, a starting price of less than £135 could see the Moto G 
become a great choice as a stocking filler as well as a great option for
those wanting a device that wows and yet doesn't break the bank.

'The customisation aspect is another string to its bow for the emerging and modern markets alike, with a selection of appealing changeable covers available to lend a sense of style.'
