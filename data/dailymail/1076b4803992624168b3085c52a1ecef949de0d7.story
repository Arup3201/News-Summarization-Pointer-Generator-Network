A Champions League tie played in England is one of 380 football matches across Europe suspected of being fixed by an Asian based crime syndicate.

Europol - the European Union's law enforcement agency - said an 18 month investigation uncovered corruption 'on a scale that threatens the very fabric of the game.'

It also claimed to have evidence of up to 425 players, officials and criminals thought to have been involved in the corruption.

Elite: The Champions League, Europe's top club football competition, has apparently been targeted as part of the match-fixing ring

Investigation: Britain's Rob Wainwright, second from left, announced the probe at a press conference in The Hague today

Suspect: A Champions League matched played in England in the past three or four years is one of the 380 matches investigators say was fixed. The competition's final will be held at Wembley this year

Rob Wainwright, director of Europol, 
yesterday refused to identify the allegedly corrupt match played in 
England due to 'ongoing judicial proceedings'.

But he confirmed it had taken place 
in the last three to four years meaning ties involving Manchester 
United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspurs and Manchester City could 
be involved.

World Cup and European qualifiers and
'several top football matches in European leagues' are among those 
under suspicion with a further 300 outside the continent.

Mr Wainwright said: 'This is a sad day for European football.

'This is the work of a suspected organised crime syndicate based in Asia and operated with criminal networks around Europe.

'It is clear to us this is the biggest-ever investigation into suspected match-fixing in Europe.

'It has yielded major results which we think have uncovered a big problem for the integrity of football in Europe.

'We have uncovered an extensive criminal network.'

Europol believes a crime syndicate 
based in Singapore was liaising with criminal networks throughout 
Europe, including some Russian speaking gangs.

A single fixed match can involve up 
to 50 suspects in 10 different countries making it extremely hard to 
track down and prosecute those involved.

Mr Wainwright added: 'The focus has 
been on other countries, not the United Kingdom. However we were 
surprised by the scale generally of the criminal enterprise and just how
widespread it was.

'It would be naive and complacent of 
those in the UK to think such a criminal conspiracy does not involve the
English game and all the football in Europe.'

Corruption: Europol says the match-fixing has taken place in 15 counties and 50 people have been arrested to date

In Germany where £13.8 million was 
wagered on matches in the country with payments of £1.73m believed to 
have paid to those involved.

Financial details were not given for 
other countries said to be involved, except that the biggest payment to 
an individual was in Austria for a total of £121,000.

Friedhelm Althans, a German investigator, said: 'This is the tip of the iceberg'.

German police yesterday described a 
global network involving couriers ferrying bribes of up to £86,000 per 
match around the world to pay off players and referees.

In Germany 14 people have already 
been jailed in relation to match fixing and convictions have also been 
secured in Finland, Hungary, Slovenia and Austria.

A UEFA spokesman confirmed they would co-operate with the investigation.

He said: 'We will be liaising with Europol in relation to any reports of match fixing in European competition.'
