Pieces of debris from the Virgin Galactic spaceship that broke apart  mid-flight have been found 35 miles from the main crash site.

Acting National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) chairman Christopher Hart said investigators had recovered parts small enough to have been blown that distance by the wind.

The main wreckage from Friday's crash that killed one pilot and injured another is spread over a five-mile area in the Mojave Desert in California.

Federal accident investigators have an early sense of what went wrong on SpaceShipTwo, but they still do not know why the craft prematurely shifted its shape prior to the deadly crash. 

Mr Hart said cockpit video and data showed the co-pilot unlocked SpaceShipTwo's unique 'feathering' system earlier than planned.

The system works somewhat like the wing flaps airplanes use to slow for landing — except that SpaceShipTwo's entire twin tails rotate up at a far more extreme angle, to a position that creates strong resistance and slows the descent.

Authorities say the co-pilot unlocked the system before planned, but this was one of two steps necessary to change the craft's configuration and was not enough on its own to do so.

Activating the feathering system requires the pulling of a lever, not unlike a gun that fires only when the trigger is pulled, not just because the safety has been disengaged. 

But unlocking the system may have set off a chain of events that led to disintegration of the craft.

NTSB spokesman Peter Knudson said Monday investigators believe once the feathers were unlocked, 'aerodynamic forces' buffeting the craft as it hurtled along about 760 mph caused the feathers to start rotating. Within a few seconds, the craft began to disintegrate, NTSB investigators determined.

SpaceShipTwo is carried aloft on the underside of a jet-powered mother ship. It then drops from that ship and fires its own rocket to head higher.

The feathers are not supposed to engage until the craft reaches a speed of Mach 1.4, or more than 1,000 mph, Mr Hart told reporters.

Mr Knudson stressed that a final cause will take months to determine, and that investigators were looking into other factors, including pilot training, mechanical failure and design flaws.

Passenger jets typically fly about seven miles high. Virgin Galactic envisions flights with six passengers climbing to more than 62 miles above Earth. 

Seats sell for $250,000 and the company says it has booked passengers including Justin Bieber, Ashton Kutcher and Russell Brand.

The ultimate goal of Virgin Galactic co-owner Richard Branson is to create an industry that can move people around the globe in a fraction of the current time it takes passenger jets, by rocketing them into space and back down.

But the company now lacks not only a craft to fly, but also an understanding of what caused the crash.

Though rival companies also are pushing ahead, the dawn of space tourism seems to have been pushed beyond the horizon yet again.

SpaceShipTwo has been under development for years, and Branson originally predicted passengers would be enjoying the wonders of flight by now. In the weeks before the crash, he said he hoped to fly in 2015.

Branson still plans to be on the maiden voyage, with his family. He said that day will not come before a new round of crew-only flights.

'We need to be absolutely certain our spaceship has been thoroughly tested — and that it will be,' he said. 'And once it's thoroughly tested, and we can go to space, we will go to space.'

Friday's crash could trigger increased government regulation.

To give the fledgling commercial space industry space to innovate, the Federal Aviation Administration has not overregulated test flights during the past decade, according to Diane Howard, an assistant professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University who specializes in space law.

But the crash could allow the FAA to propose new rules that would affect future Virgin Galactic flights, and 'it will be very interesting to see how Congress and the FAA and industry respond,' Howard said.

The FAA did not immediately comment Monday. The agency is able to initiate a rule-making process that would affect the design or operation of a spacecraft involved in a fatal accident, but is unlikely to do so before the end of the NTSB's investigation.
