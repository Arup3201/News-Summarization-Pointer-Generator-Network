Nine-year-old Keat Rhodes looks just like any other little girl - but she was actually born male.

The schoolgirl was only seven years old when she was diagnosed with gender identity disorder and began her transition from boy to girl.

Since then she has undergone an incredible transformation with the support of her adoptive parents Emily and Clint LeVan, from Ohio.

Keat Rhodes, 9, was born male and was only seven years old when she was diagnosed with gender identity disorder and began her transition from boy to girl

And over the next few years, Keat, who has a younger brother, Blaine, seven, will undergo treatment to complete her transition from male to female.

Today Keat is the picture of happiness but it hasn't been easy and the family has endured a huge backlash from parents in their community.

Made the subject of a Facebook hate campaign, they were accused of child abuse. Some even suggested Emily was turning Keat in to a Barbie doll.

But they have fought the bullies and are striving to give their daughter a normal life.

Full-time mother Emily, 36, said: 'When Keat came into our lives, he was a four-year-old boy called Keaton.

'But we noticed very early on that he was different to his brother.

'While Blaine preferred playing with trucks and cars, Keat liked dolls. At school he liked playing dress up with the princess dresses.'

She added: 'Clint and I weren't bothered by the toys either of the boys played with, as long as they were happy.'

At a young age, Keat began drawing himself as a female and also confided in his parents, as well as school teachers, that he was a girl.'Â

Emily said: 'At first we thought she was messing around. We thought it was a phase and we sort of laughed it off.

'But when she began talking about it with people outside the house we realised it was serious.

'At the time I was a little scared for him because I didn't really know a lot about transgender people and I didn't know what would happen to him or us if he became a girl.

'We live in a very small town in one of the poorest counties in Ohio - no-one in our community had probably ever heard of transgender people either.

'And a lot of people aren't that accepting of people who are different.'

Clint and Emily took Keat to see their family doctor and were then referred to a therapist as well as a psychiatrist, who both diagnosed gender identity disorder

Grocery store manager Clint, 41, and Emily took Keat to see their family doctor and were then referred to a therapist as well as a psychiatrist, who both diagnosed gender identity disorder.

Emily said: 'It seemed strange that a child so young would be so sure about something like this but all the experts said Keat was "unwavering, consistent and persistent".

'And after doing a lot of research we decided it was right to let him live socially as a girl.'

Keat's transition began during a break for the summer holiday at school. During the two-month period, Clint and Emily changed their son's name by deed poll and they took her shopping for more feminine clothes to wear.

Emily said: 'Keat was so happy in her skin but I dreaded that first day back at school where she would be going back to class with pigtails and a pink backpack.

'She was the first in the school district to have transitioned so I knew there would be some confusion.

'But the teachers were supportive - they explained everything to the pupils and, incredibly, they were very accepting.

'The backlash actually came from some family and friends - Clint's dad couldn't accept Keat and my mum struggled before she eventually came to terms with it.

'We lost friends and we also started getting a lot of abuse on Facebook from parents in the community.

'People were saying it was child abuse. One dad even said he was going to "beat the boy back in to Keat".

'Some mums said I had a doll complex and I was trying to create a real life Barbie. I just sat in front of my computer and cried because I couldn't believe that these people were saying these hateful things.'

Despite all the negative comments, Clint and Emily say they had support from their local church and an online community of parents with transgender children.

They were also inundated with messages from others telling them to fight on. Today they are focusing on Keat's future.

In November this year she will have her first appointment with an endocrinologist to discuss testosterone blockers, which she will begin when she starts puberty.

At 15, she will have counselling to determine if she is ready to start hormone therapy, which will allow her to develop breast tissue but will make her infertile.

By the age of 18, she will be eligible for full gender reassignment surgery.

Emily said: 'Thinking of what lies ahead, I do have my fears. I am worried she will be bullied and face prejudice. I also know there is a high suicide risk among transgender people.

'But I hope that with our love she will grow up to have a normal life.

'It just comes down to love and if you love your child then you should do anything in the world for them. It's a simple and pure as that.'

Gender identity disorder (GID) or transsexualism is defined by strong, persistent feelings of identification with the opposite gender and discomfort with one's own assigned sex.

People with GID desire to live as members of the opposite sex and often dress and use mannerisms associated with the other gender.

For instance, a person identified as a boy may feel and act like a girl. This is distinct from homosexuality in that homosexuals nearly always identify with their apparent sex or gender.
