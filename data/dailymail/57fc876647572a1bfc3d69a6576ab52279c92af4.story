Google Streetview has already captured couples in flagrante, prostitutes plying their trade and, apparently, a murder being being committed.

But pranksters have now come up with one of the most bizarre internet hoaxes yet - a 'half cat' apparently pictured strolling down the road in Ottawa, Canada.

The image of the ghoulish creature, with only two legs, a tail and now ears, quickly went viral as tens of thousands speculated on its background.

Today the original picture of the so-called 'half-cat' was posted online to website photo sharing site Imgur.

The white cat's name is actually Thumbelina and her freakish alter ego was created by someone on Imgur by using two different photos merged together.

This was then dubbed the 'Bipedal 
Half-Cat, a strange and beautiful feline creature with only two limbs 
and a tail'.

The mystery of the half-cat has been solved after it was revealed it is in fact Thumbelina, a perfectly normal cat from Ottowa, Canada

As spoof news story of its discovery 
hails the photograph as proof of the existence of 'the only mammal not 
to possess any forelimbs at all'.

Later, a YouTube video surfaced of a real-life half-cat.

The clip shows a black and white cat called Anakin who seems perfectly healthy, despite having only its two front legs.

According
 to his owners, he was born without a pelvis or two back legs and 
manages to get around without any trouble thanks to his tail.
