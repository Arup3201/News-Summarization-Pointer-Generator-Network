Former Casualty star Clive Mantle has admitted he is ‘utterly shellshocked’ after two men he called Rab C Nesbitt-type Scots were cleared of an attack in which a chunk of his ear was gnawed off.

Philip McGilvray, 33, admitted biting the 6ft 5in actor’s ear after they clashed in a Newcastle hotel corridor in a late night row over noise last March, but claimed self-defence.

He and his friend Alan French, 32, were cleared of grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent and the lesser charge of GBH after a jury at Newcastle Crown Court deliberated for almost five hours.

Trial: Former Casualty actor Clive Mantle said he is 'utterly shellshocked' after Philip McGilvray, right, and his friend Alan French were cleared of GBH despite one biting part of his ear off

The court heard how Mr French and Mr 
McGilvray, both of Hamilton, Lanarkshire, had been in the city for a 
weekend with friends and had been drinking heavily since earlier in the 
morning.

Mr McGilvray, his 
friends and Mr Mantle were all staying in the same Travelodge on 
Newcastle’s Quayside where the incident happened.

Relief: Mr French smiled as he left Newcastle Crown Court following the verdict yesterday

The
 court heard how Mr French and Mr McGilvray had been in the corridor 
making a lot of noise when Mr Mantle, 56, came out to ask them to 
quieten down on March 24 last year.

There
 was then a scuffle in which Mr Mantle – who has starred in the hit TV 
show Game of Thrones – allegedly ran at the pair and they ended up 
locked in a fight.

The court heard Mr Mantle was on top of Mr McGilvray, who called him a 'big monster' and feared 'he was trying to kill me'

So he admitted biting a part of Mr Mantle's ear off. It was put in a glass of water to preserve it, but that compromised the tissue and it could not be re-attached.

Neither of the acquitted men wanted to comment as they walked out of court with family members yesterday.

But
 Mr Mantle issued a statement  in which he said: ‘I am utterly 
shellshocked by the verdict of the court, and have lost a great deal of 
faith in a process which can deliver such an injustice.

‘As
 much as I am hurt and baffled by the decision, I am more worried at the
 message it gives out to law-abiding people who dare to point out the 
terrible behaviour of  others. Are we all just meant to sit back and not
 say anything?

‘The fact that violent acts go unpunished is equally worrying.

‘I
 would like to thank my friends, family and hundreds of well-wishers for
 their support and I look forward to getting back to work.’

Room for the night: Mr Mantle was staying at the £91-a-night Newcastle Quayside Travelodge while working in the area. But the jury did not accept he suffered GBH that night

Mr
 Mantle was appearing in a touring production of The Ladykillers and was
 woken in his room by repeated shouting in the corridor outside. The 
actor went to summon security when there was a clash in which the three 
men ended on the floor and Mr Mantle’s ear was severed.

Mr McGilvray claimed he was  acting in self-defence after the actor charged at him and knocked him to the floor.

He
 told the jury: ‘I turned around and the next thing I was taken out by 
this big guy. It was like being hit by a car. I was on my back and Mr 
Mantle was straight on top of me.’

He believed he had no alternative but to bite Mr Mantle’s ear to stop the attack.

Mr
 McGilvray told the court he had previously been in trouble for fighting
 and had been convicted of assault. He also said his brother had been 
stabbed to death.

Mr French 
said he saw the two wrestling on the floor and tried to intervene. He 
told the court: ‘I started shouting, telling him to walk away, please 
walk away, you don’t need to do this.’
