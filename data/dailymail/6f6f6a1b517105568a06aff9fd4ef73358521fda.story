They made her Britain's most-hated scrounger - and Josie Cunningham's latest publicity-hungry stunt involved celebrating the anniversary of her NHS boob job.

The mother-of-three sported a blonde wig and a tiny orange crop top on a wild night out in London's Soho to celebrate the second birthday of her taxpayer-funded breasts.

Ahead of her night out, she took to Twitter to say: '2 years today I got my pair of double D's David and dwight. Cameron's a right t** - just like mine xxx'.

Dubbed the most hated woman in Britain, Josie Cunningham hit London's Soho on Friday night to celebrate the two-year anniversary of her NHS boob op

After playing up to the cameras on her night out, she was pictured falling over and looking worse for wear 

Playing up to the cameras, she blew on party horns and pinned a large badge reading 'It's my birthday' on the back of the skintight grey leggings.  

And true to form, pictures showed her stumbling around the streets, flashing the birthday boobs and eventually end up on the floor.  

Earlier this month, the wannabe glamour model shamelessly invited Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to her celebrations, adding she wanted to show him she was 'grateful' for the operation. 

She tweeted the MP: 'Having a birthday party for my boobies at the end of the month.

'To show how grateful I am… Wanna come?'

Miss Cunningham first hit the headlines two years ago when she sparked fury after receiving a £4,800 boob job on the NHS, taking her from a 32A to a 36DD. 

The tale, about how the single mother on benefits, was given a free breast enlargement, sparked instant outrage in a Britain just emerging from recession.

She followed that appearance with another, this time on Page 3, which showed off the results of the operation and left little to the imagination.

Revelling in the furore, she then made appearances in which she played on her new-found infamy, most notoriously when she stepped out topless with her nipples covered with NHS-branded tape. 

Miss Cunningham's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting her unborn child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother.

The mother of three later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school.
