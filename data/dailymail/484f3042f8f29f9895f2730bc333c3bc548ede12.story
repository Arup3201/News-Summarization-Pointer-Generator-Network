Andre Schurrle rewarded himself with a visit to the cinema with girlfriend Montana Yorke after returning to Chelsea training following an illness.Â 

The 23-year-old missed Chelsea's 6-0 win over Maribor in the Champions League on Tuesday, but took to Twitter to show himself on an exercise bike before heading to see a film.

With the snap, the German forward wrote: 'Cinema with @montsxo and #lauren.'

Schurrle may be relied upon by manager Jose Mourinho as a central striker when Chelsea visit Louis van Gaal's Manchester United on Sunday.

Diego Costa and  deputy goalscorer Loic Remy are both expected to be absent for Chelsea's trip to Old Trafford through groin injuries.

Mourinho is unlikely to be able to play Didier Drobga for the full 90 minutes either, with the veteran striker struggling for full fitness.
