Sex is set to be the subject of a new exhibition opening later this year.

Featuring more than 200 objects, The Institute Of Sexology will run for a year at the Â£17.5 million expansion of the Wellcome Collection in London.

Sex toys, paintings, medical artefacts, films, carvings, prints and photographs of sex will go on display in the show, the first UK exhibition to bring together the pioneers of the study of sex.

It will look at key sexologists including Sigmund Freud, Marie Stopes and Alfred Kinsey and trace the experiments and studies carried out about sex over the decades.

From 'Alfred Kinsey's complex coded questionnaires to Samoan jewellery to sex machines', the show will 'investigate how ... sexologists have shaped our ever-evolving attitudes towards sexual behaviour and identity'.

Curators said that The Institute Of Sexology will include commissions, live events, discussions and performance art and 'form part of a sexology season of activity across the country.'

Curator Kate Forde said: 'The Institute Of Sexology offers a complex, often contradictory story of the study of sex, and highlights the profound effect that the gathering and analysis of information can have in changing attitudes about the human condition.

'The exhibition presents typed diagnoses alongside handmade campaign material, scientific charts next to handwritten testimonies.

'But all are caught up in attempts to free us from the tyranny of preconceived ideas about sex, and suggest that our understanding about our sexual identities is a story of constant evolution.'
