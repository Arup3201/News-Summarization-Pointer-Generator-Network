The formation that Louis van Gaal started with against Swansea — three central defenders and two wing backs — is a hard enough system for seasoned professionals to get right, let alone a group of youngsters, including a few making their debuts at Old Trafford.

I’ve always felt it demands too much of the wing backs, who have to cover so much ground. If their positioning is not spot on, then the central defenders have to react and cover the danger, but this can result in your team shape being dragged from side to side. And that’s exactly what happened to United on Saturday.

Mishaps: The build-up to Swansea's opener highlighted how United were dragged from side to side

There were 29 passes in the Swansea move for the first goal, but it should have been stopped sooner. Ashley Young, playing as a wing back, dropped to full back, which meant he was marking Nathan Dyer (1). 

Tyler Blackett should have moved across to act as the full back, leaving Young to deal with Swansea right back Angel Rangel. Instead, Darren Fletcher and Ander Herrera were forced to press Rangel (2). Blackett got too tight to Gylfi Sigurdsson but Chris Smalling and Phil Jones needed to move across to cover. They didn’t and they left Swansea acres of room to run into (3).

By the time the ball reached Sigurdsson, the United midfield, who should have been protecting the defence, were nowhere to be seen. With the defenders also out of position, Ki Sung-yueng was left free to fire home from the edge of the area.

Out of position: Manchester United were all over the place for Swansea's second goal on Saturday

Give Van Gaal credit: he saw there were problems and changed to four at the back at half-time. But they were still all over the place for the second goal.

Blackett was naive in the extreme to give the ball away with his team-mates out of position.

Montero sprang down the left and Smalling went to cover, with Jones moving inside. The United pair should be adept at switching positions but they made a mess of it. Smalling did not do enough to stop the cross (1) while Jones over-covered and got too close to him (2). He should be worrying about what’s coming into the box. When the cross beat Young at the back post (3), and was passed to Sigurdsson, he was free to score with Jones out of position.
