If you want to use your phone in London stay out of St Pancras, while people who want to talk on the phone on the train are best off with Three.

That’s according to new research that looked at popular commuting routes in the capital.

And they found one in three internet tasks were dropped and one in seven calls failed during testing.

Engineers have tested voice and data connections in London (shown in map). They travelled back and forth on the ten most popular lines. All were found to be plagued by poor voice and data connections. One in three internet tasks were dropped during testing

The research was carried out by Global Wireless Solutions (GWS).

They carried out high-level tests while travelling back and forth on the ten most popular commuting routes in and our of London.

And they found that the lines were plagued by reliability issues for both voice calls and data transfers. 

When attempting to send data ‘packets’ while on the routes, one in four 3G packets and one in three 4G packets didn’t send properly.

EE, O2 and Vodafone were all found to rely heavily on their older 2G networks.

Vodafone customers got the best 3G data service, while EE offered the best 4G service.

But GWS’ testing suggests that it’s not just the mobile internet that Londoners struggle to use while commuting: one in seven voice calls (14 per cent) made from trains fail too.

Three was a clear winner for call quality and reliability here.

The poor service from the other operators was blamed on their continued use of 2G and half-rate codecs.

One in seven calls were also found to fail due to networks still using 2G, although Three was found to be the best. Meanwhile the worst station to get a connection was found to be St Pancras

Meanwhile, one in four of the data task failures (24.18 per cent to be exact) GWS’ engineers experienced occurred while they were on trains in stations, while one in five occurred when they were on trains on open stretches of track.

However, voice calls are more likely to fail on open track than in a station; one in four of the voice ‘failures’ GWS’ engineers experienced occurred when they were in a station, compared to 1 in 3 when they were on open track.

GWS found that voice and data failures are more likely to occur when a train is travelling from zero to five miles (eight kilometres) per hour than when it is travelling between speeds of five and 50 (eight and 80 kilometres) per hour.

Failures are most likely to occur when a train is travelling above 50mph (80km/h).

For stations, St Pancras has by far and away the worst connectivity of all of those tested by GWS.

The engineers experienced an average of 99 voice and packet data failures (across the four operators) while testing in the famous station.

Paul Carter, CEO of GWS, commented: 'Leaves on the track, the wrong kind of snow, having to stand up all the way to work and back - commuters have enough to contend with without the kind of mobile connectivity problems we’re revealing today.

'It’s hard to believe we’re in 2014 and in a situation whereby a trained wizard would have a tough time getting a signal on the Hogwarts Express while it’s sitting in St Pancras.

'Pressure from commuters makes it inevitable that trains won’t keep their status as mobile dead zones for much longer.

'It’d be great to see networks, rail operators and station-masters taking the lead on improving connectivity for commuters - rather than having to be dragged into the 21st Century kicking and screaming.'

However a spokesman for the station tells MailOnline it was 'only an issue for people using Thameslink trains from two platforms that are essentially below the surface'
