Energy firm Npower has been accused of issuing demands to customers through an invented firm of debt collectors.

The German-owned company, which has seen complaints against it double from December 2013 to March 2014, has reportedly sent customers in arrears threatening letters from a debt-collection agency called Collections Direct.

The letters which have the name Collections Direct at the top, threaten recipients with court action and bailiffs.

But at the bottom of the letter it states that Collections Direct is a trading name of npower.

Bottom of the league: Npower has suffered the double whammy of falling to the bottom of a customer complaints league while also being accused of sending out letters from a made-up debt collection agency

The Daily Mirror reports that one example begins 'Final Demand' before stating 'It's a legal requirement to send you notice of an intended court summons before it's issued'.

Npower insists that the firm does exist in its own right, and that it is used as a last resort.

A spokesman said:'We use these letters after we have made 4 attempts to communicate with the customer, three of them using the npower logo and letterhead - the other by phone.

'The purpose of this letter, with a different name, is to make sure the customer knows that the process has reached an escalated stage, when we or an external agency will be pursuing the matter through legal action.

'However, we are still clear about npower being the sender of the letter and continue to offer help and further time for payment. While our letters are already fully compliant, we are looking at their content.'

But the controversy will be damaging for the supplier, especially given that it comes as Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice Scotland revealed that almost twice as many complaints were made about npower in January to March this year, compared to the last three months of 2013.

The latest complaints league table released by the consumer charity sees npower firmly at rock bottom in sixth place, with 592.4 per every 100,000 customers in January to March 2014, or one complaint for every 168.8.

The firm said that a system switchover has precipitated a host of issues for consumers, and claim that other power suppliers will encounter a similar issue when changing their systems.

Scottish Power sits just above them in fifth, but, worryingly, Citizens Advice also said that complaints about all suppliers have increased.

Changeover: Npower say switchover to a new system has led to the large increase in customer complaints

Citizens Advice Chief Executive Gillian Guy said: 'The knock-on effect of poor billing systems can turn household budgets upside down. Many people do not have the spare cash to cover the cost of a large bill that suddenly lands on their doorstep.

'A rise in complaints about all suppliers is concerning. Suppliers won’t win the trust of customers back unless they show they understand what consumers need, recognise the financial pressures many people are under and are able to sort out problems quickly.

'This is something that all suppliers can act on now.'

Notorious payday lender Wonga was ordered to pay £2.6million in 
compensation after sending letters threatening legal action from made-up
 law firms to customers in arrears.

After conducting an investigation into the practice, the Financial Conduct Authority reported that the firm wrote to 45,000 customers 
who had fallen into arrears posing as 'Chainey, D’Amato & Shannon' 
and 'Barker and Lowe Legal Recoveries'.

Subsequent investigations found that the names were taken from staff working at Wonga.

Claims
 then emerged accusing the official Student Loans Company of using 
similar tactics, with warnings being sent to graduates by firm ‘Smith 
Lawson and Company’.

High-street banks have also been implicated, with Royal Bank of 
Scotland and its NatWest arm, along with HSBC, Lloyds and Nat West all 
allegedly sending out letters from what appeared to be independent 
solicitors when actually they are from the firms themselves.
