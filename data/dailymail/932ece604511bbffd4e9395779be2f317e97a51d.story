Pop star James Blunt has attacked Labour shadow minister Chris Bryant after he criticised the number of posh actors and musicians

Singer James Blunt has fired off another shot in his war of words with outspoken MP Chris Bryant – after the Labour shadow minister criticised the number of posh actors and musicians in Britain.

Labour MP Chris Bryant claimed British culture was 'dominated' by stars like Blunt and Eddie Redmayne who went to expensive boarding schools.

The remarks, which come in the wake of Redmayne's best actor Oscar nomination last week, sparked a furious response from Harrow-educated Blunt. 

The You're Beautiful star accused Mr Bryant of being a 'prejudiced wazzock' who was using the 'politics of jealousy' to win votes.

Mr Bryant hit back at the pop star's online attack - criticising him for being 'so blooming precious'.

But 40-year-old Blunt reignited the row this morning - taking to Twitter to accuse the Labour MP of failing to help people from ordinary backgrounds achieve success.

In a message posted this morning on Blunt’s official Twitter page, he wrote: ‘To help people at the bottom of the tree join those near the top, give them a ladder, not a bow and arrow.’

The message was more restrained than his online rant yesterday, in which he accused the Labour MP of being a 'prejudiced wazzock'.

In his letter to Mr Bryant, Labour's  shadow culture minister, Blunt claimed that the £30,000 a year boarding school he attended did nothing to help him break into the music industry.

The  Brit award-winner also claims that people in the music industry tried to get him to change his accent so he sounded less posh.

Blunt opened his letter to Mr Bryant by accusing him of being a 'classist gimp', despite the fact that the Labour MP himself was privately educated at £20,000 a year Cheltenham College before attending Oxford.

In Blunt's letter, he wrote: 'I happened to go to a boarding school. No one helped me at boarding school to get into the music business.'

He added: 'I bought my first guitar with money I saved from holiday jobs (sandwich packing!). I was taught the only four chords I know by a friend.

'No one at school had ANY knowledge or contacts in the music business, and I was expected to become a soldier or a lawyer or perhaps a stockbroker. So alien was it, that people laughed at the idea of me going into the music business, and certainly no one was of any use.'

Blunt said even in the army, which he joined after university, he was told that trying to become a pop star was a 'mad idea'.

He wrote: 'And when I left the army, going against everyone's advice, EVERYONE I met in the British music industry told me there was no way it would work for me because I was too posh. One record company even asked if I could speak in a different accent. (I told them I could try Russian).

'Every step of the way, my background has been AGAINST me succeeding in the music business. And when I have managed to break through, I was STILL scoffed at for being too posh for the industry.'

He added: 'You come along, looking for votes, telling working class people that posh people like me don't deserve it, and that we must redress the balance.

'But it is your populist, envy-based, vote-hunting ideas which make our country crap, far more than me and my s*** songs, and my plummy accent.

'I got signed in America, where they don't give a stuff about, or even understand what you mean by me and 'my ilk', you prejudiced wazzock, and I worked my a*** off.

'What you teach is the politics of jealousy. Rather than celebrating success and figuring out how we can all exploit it further as the Americans do, you instead talk about how we can hobble that success and 'level the playing field'.

'Perhaps what you've failed to realise is that the only head-start my school gave me in the music business, where the VAST majority of people are NOT from boarding school, is to tell me that I should aim high. Perhaps it protected me from your kind of narrow-minded, self-defeating, lead-us-to-a-dead-end, remove-the-'G'-from-'GB' thinking, which is to look at others' success and say, 'it's not fair'.'

Blunt signed off his letter: 'Up yours.'

But Mr Bryant accused the pop star of being 'blooming precious'.

In a letter in response, the MP wrote: 'I'm not knocking your success. I even contributed to it by buying one of your albums. I'm not knocking Eddie Redmayne, either. He was the best Richard II I have ever seen.

'If you'd read the whole of my interview, you'd have seen that I make the point that the people who subsidise the arts the most are artists themselves. Of course that includes you.

'But it is a statement of the blindingly obvious that that is far tougher if you come from a poor family where you have to hand over your holiday earnings to help pay the family bills.'
