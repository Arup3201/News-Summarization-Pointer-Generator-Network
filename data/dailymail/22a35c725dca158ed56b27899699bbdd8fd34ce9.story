Accused: Andrei Lugovoi takes the polygraph test

A former KGB agent suspected of murdering Alexander Litvinenko has told a press conference that he will no longer assist the UK-based inquest into the spy's death.

Andrei Lugovoy, who is now a Russian politician, told a conference in Moscow hosted by Russian news agency Interfax that he could not receive 'justice' in Britain.

According to Interfax, Lugovoy told the 
press conference: 'I have no hope to get justice in the UK. I finally 
lost faith in the possibility of an impartial investigation of the case 
in England. I have to say that I'm out of the coroner's investigation 
and I will not participate in it.'

Mr Litvinenko, 43, died in November 2006 after he was poisoned with polonium-210 while drinking tea at a London meeting - allegedly with Lugovoy, who denies all involvement.

Poisoned: Alexander Litvinenko at London's University College Hospital shortly before his death in 2006

While attempts to extradite Lugovoy 
to the UK have been rejected by the Russians, it was thought he might 
have provided video-link evidence to the inquest in London.The prime 
suspect in the murder of Alexander Litvinenko will ask a British judge 
to allow lie-detector evidence to be admitted at the inquest into the 
death of the Russian dissident.

Andrei Lugovoi, who is accused of
poisoning Mr Litvinenko with radioactive polonium-210  at a London 
hotel in 2006, says the results of  the polygraph test he took in Russia
earlier this year prove he was not involved.

The Crown Prosecution Service has 
named Mr Lugovoi as the prime suspect in the case and is seeking his 
extradition to the UK to face trial. 

But the former Russian intelligence 
officer has refused to surrender himself to British justice and has 
agreed only to provide video evidence to the inquest next year.

He has asked his lawyers to challenge 
rules which prevent  lie-detector evidence being admitted in court 
because it is considered unreliable.

It has been claimed that Lugovoy and another former KGB agent, Dmitry Kovtun, poisoned Mr Litvinenko at the Millennium Hotel in London's Grosvenor Square.

Lugovoi said charges against him were part of a smear campaign by Kremlin foes and British secret services aimed at discrediting Russia

A previous hearing was told that Mr Litvinenko had been hired by MI6 for a number of years and was working with the Spanish secret service investigating the Russian mafia shortly before his death.

He was said to regularly meet with an MI6 handler, named only as Martin, in central London and was paid by both the British and Spanish secret services into a joint bank account he held with his wife.

Last month, coroner Sir Robert Owen ruled that sensitive evidence alleged to expose Mr Litvinenko's ties to MI6 will be examined in secret.

His family have urged the Government to reveal the documents but Foreign Secretary William Hague has argued that the disclosure could pose a risk to national security.

The nature of the evidence contained within the files remains unclear but lawyers for the Litvinenko family claim the documents could point towards Russian state involvement.

The inquest is due to formally open on May 1, more than six years after Mr Litvinenko was killed.

A spokesman for the inquest said: "It is too early to say whether Mr Lugovoy will be called to give evidence and, if he is, how it would be given."
