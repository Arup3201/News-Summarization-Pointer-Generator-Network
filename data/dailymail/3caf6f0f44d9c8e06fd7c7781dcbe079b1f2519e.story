A new biography of Vladimir Putin paints a picture of the Russian president as a 'traumatised' man and speculates that he might be homosexual.

Moscow political scientist Stanislav Belkovsky's book 'Putin' claim the rumoured affair between the president and an Olympic gymnast was an invention by his PR team and that he might be 'latently gay'

The book also claims that the 61-year-old president finds sex 'alien' and that he prefers animals over humans.

Belkovsky has outraged the Kremlin with his book in which he portrays the ruler of the largest country on earth as the weak son of an alcoholic.

Belkovsky says the key to understanding Vladimir Putin lies in his childhood.

He writes: ‘The small Vladimir, who grew up practically without a father and without the love and care of his parents, was a withdrawn and grim child.

'Putin was born the son of an alcoholic two years before his official birth date. His mother had moved to Georgia with Vladimir, only for the child to be shunted off to Leningrad a short time later to the couple who would become the official parents of the future president.’

According to Belkovsky, Putin has spent his life in search of a ‘surrogate family.’ He names Boris Yeltsin as Putin's surrogate father and in Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, an orphan, he found a brother.

He calls Putin a ‘deeply lonely politician’ who prefers animals to people, and adds that the macho photos of him with topless tigers and bears are not staged. 

’Therein lies the real Putin,’ argues Belkovsky. ‘He flees from people and his obligations to nature.

'Here we have Vladimir's best friends; the Labrador Conny and the Bulgarian shepherd dog Buffy, his only roommates in the presidential residence.’

Belkovsky says that Kremlin image-polishers continually pump out stories about his sexual prowess and claims his alleged affair with beautiful former gymnast and Olympic champion Alina Kabaeva was an invention of his PR team. 

He says: ‘Sex and a sex life to him are alien,’ and he speculates that he may be ‘latently gay.’

The lives of Putin's two daughters, Mariya, 28, and 27-year-old Ekaterina, are scrutinised too in the book.

Spiegel magazine in Germany, which reviewed it this week, said: ‘Mariya was romantically involved with a Dutch architect. When he was forced into a ditch by the armoured motorcade of a Moscow banker, it took only 15 minutes for the culprits to be arrested. 

‘The commander of this lightning-speed operation was later appointed interior minister by Putin, while the banker, who was immediately sentenced to seven years in prison, now 'has adequate opportunity to reflect on the quiet Dutch architect,' Belkovsky wrote.’

Yekaterina lives with the son of Nikolai Shamalov, a longtime Putin pal who mediates between Russian bureaucrats and western businessmen in lucrative deals in the medical industry. 

Belkovsky claims that the daughters and their partners benefit enormously thanks to the power of their father.

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov thundered: ‘Belkovsky's remarks are lacking any basis, or as we say it in Russia: They are total rubbish.’
