More than 100 BBC executives are earning six-figure salaries, despite pledges to curb top pay and offer viewers better value for money,

New figures have revealed that more than 100 of the corporation's top earners make at least £100,000 a year, and 80 of them are on salaries of £150,000 or more.

According to an official BBC register of elite staff, 13 executives were also given a pay rise of up to 10 per cent, at a time when the broadcaster is facing cuts to its spending.

Value for money: Since Lord Tony Hall took over the post of BBC director general in April last year he has been trying to cut the percentage of executives from 2.5 per cent of the workforce to one per cent

It also follows last year's severance pay scandal in which the National Audit Office found that the BBC handed over £1.4million more in pay-offs to senior managers than it needed to.

Since Lord Hall took over the post of director general in April last year he has been trying to cut the percentage of executives from 2.5 per cent of the workforce to one per cent.

And although more than 25 senior managers have left the broadcaster since his tenure began, the number of serving managers required to declare their income as more than £100,000 has risen from 100 to 102, according to the Sunday Times.

The BBC said that the loss of these 25 senior figures had led to savings to the pay bill of more than £2million between March 31, 2013, and January 1 of this year, and that the number of senior management earners had also fallen by two per cent.

Since taking over as director general, Lord Hall has been keen to argue that the BBC provides value for money and in a speech to the Oxford Media Convention last week he said  a BBC survey had shown that some viewers would happily pay between £15 and £20 a month, compared to the £12 currently paid.

Cost: Lord Hall has suggested that viewers who watch BBC programmes through the iPlayer catch-up service should be forced to pay the £145.50 annual licence fee

He also accepted
 the BBC needs to cut the amount it spends and refused to rule 
out making cuts to some channels such as BBC Three or BBC Four, as well 
as suggesting that viewers who watch BBC programmes through the iPlayer 
catch-up service should be forced to pay the £145.50 annual licence fee,
 which currently only applies to those who watch shows as they are 
broadcast.

And in the wake of the severance pay scandal last year, he called
 for the Corporation to be run like an employee-owned organisation such 
as John Lewis rather than a bank seeking to maximise shareholder 
profits.

He said: ‘The BBC is not a standard public service. In 
ethos we’re less like the City and more like John Lewis...we are the 
BBC, not a PLC.’

Director General Tony Hall £450,000-a-year (a decrease of £221,000 compared with Mark Thomas but the same as George Entwistle)

Managing director, finance and operations Anne Bulford  £395,000 (£43,000 more than former chief financial officer Zarin Patel)

Director of news and current affairs James Harding £340,000 (the same as his predacessor Helen Boaden)

Director, television Danny Cohen £320,000 (£50,000 more than George Entwistle's basic salary as director of vision in 2011/12. Mr Cohen did not receive a pay increase on his promotion from controller of BBC One)

In March 2013 the number of managers required to declare their pay stood at 103, which has now risen to 111, plus four non-executive directors.

Once recently departed staff and non-executive directors are removed from the tally, the figure has risen from 100 to 102, according to the Sunday Times - although the BBC refute this.

Staff remain on the list for one quarter after their departure.

Some
 87 of them have a salary higher than that of Prime Minister David 
Cameron's £142,500-a-year pay, and 82 are on more than £150,000-a-year. 

'The website referenced still contains profiles of a number of individuals who have left the organisation and simply counting them doesn't deliver up to date numbers - the latest figures show senior manager numbers have reduced under Tony Hall by more than 25 people, reducing the pay bill by more than £2m,' a BBC spokesman told MailOnline.

'It is also factually inaccurate to suggest 100k senior management earners are up under Tony Hall - they are also down (by two per cent).'

Some senior figures have also received pay rises, despite many in the public sector being subject to a pay freeze.

Chief adviser Claire Dresser, who is 
responsible for running the Director of Television's executive office 
currently is recorded as having a salary of  £109,433 and a total remuneration of £114,233 - although that figure from November 2013 has risen nearly £10,000 from her June listing.

And controller of entertainment commissioning Mark Linsey also declared a pay rise of 10 per cent, giving him a total remuneration of £230,000 after taking on some new responsibilities.

The corporation reportedly needs to reduce this figure to 65 people by the end of 2015, and the BBC Trust has recommended that the senior management salary bill should be reduced by recruiting new figures who are paid less than their predecessors.

Lord Hall himself commands a £450,000-a-year salary, the same as his predecessor George Entwistle, who resigned after just 54 days in the job, but less than Mark Thompson who earned £671,000 a year.
