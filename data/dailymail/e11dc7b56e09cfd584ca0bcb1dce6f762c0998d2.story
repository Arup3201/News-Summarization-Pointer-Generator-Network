The competition watchdog is looking at making it cheaper for Australians to call and text from their mobile phones.

On Friday, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission released a discussion paper that outlined the options it was considering to drive down the costs of the service.

These included determining prices based on those seen overseas or a uniform price for both landline-to-mobile calls and mobile-to-mobile calls.

The paper also uncovered huge discrepancies in prices between Australia's mobile call rates and those overseas.

It costs 3.6 cents per minute to make a call in Australia.

But in the United Kingdom it is more than half that price at 1.455 cents, while in China it costs 0.681 cents and 0.176 cents in India.

This discussion paper has come out of an investigation launched in May after it was found mobile operators were charging each other too much to receive calls and texts on mobile phones.

The discussion paper was done to help the watchdog determine a new regulated price for mobile phone costs

ACCC Commissioner Cristina Cifuentes said this meant consumers were paying higher bills or experiencing reduced product offerings.

'The ACCC is now looking to determine how these services should be priced to promote competition in retail markets and benefit consumers,' she said in a statement.

'Competition has led to lower prices and greater choice for consumers for voice calls, and the ACCC expects that greater competition will similarly lower SMS prices.'

Since the ACCC started regulating the cost of mobile calls in 2004, prices have fallen from 21 cents per minute to 3.6 cents per minute.

It was also noted that the 4G network roll-out would impact on pricing as it would provide a less expensive and more efficient way of sending out data compared to older networks.
