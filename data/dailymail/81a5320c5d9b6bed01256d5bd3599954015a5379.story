It is renowned for its expensive house prices, with properties in some areas selling for an average of more than £1million.

But now, a 'loft space' has been put up for rent in central London for just £40 a week.

The only downsides are the tenant criteria: you have to be under 5ft 4in, willing to climb up a 10-foot ladder and can't suffer from claustrophobia.

Meanwhile, the average rent for a one-bed flat in Paddington is around £500 a week, with some flats going for more than £3,000 a week.

Local Spencer Thon, 26, who pays £400 a week to live in the area, said: 'Someone will definitely snap the loft conversion up.

'Rents are crazy around here and you pay for being in central London. Forty pounds a week is amazing - especially if you are at work most of the day.'
