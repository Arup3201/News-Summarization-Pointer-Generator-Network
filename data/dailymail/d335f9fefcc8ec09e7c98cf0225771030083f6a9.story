An Iraq veteran has been reunited with a bomb-sniffing army dog who saved his life after battling more than five years to adopt him.

Logan Black, 34,  served on nearly 40 missions with Diego the Labrador retriever in Iraq between 2006 and 2007, searching for hidden weapons and homemade bombs.

But he feared Diego would be transferred to another law enforcement agency or go to a stranger's home after he retired and set up a Facebook campaign to adopt him.

After thousands supported his cause to help convince the Air Force to hand over Diego, Black, from Kansas City, Missouri, has now adopted the eight-year-old dog, who he calls 'my best friend'.

Reunion: Iraq veteran Logan Black has been reunited with his bomb-sniffing army dog Diego after five years

They were reunited last Tuesday, when Black travelled to Texas to collect Diego from Lackland Air Force Base, where he was stationed to train other bomb-sniffing dogs.

'This feels fantastic,' Black told KCTV5. 'I've been waiting for this for a really long time.'

Black trained Diego and they were deployed to Fallujah, Iraq in 2006. Black, who worked as a specialised dog handler, credits Diego with saving his life.

'He comes up and starts sniffing right next to where I'm standing and gives a full indication that, "Hey dad, something's here",' Black told KCTV.

'And it turned out there were two roadside bombs that had been buried too deep for metal detectors to find.'

After Black returned to the United States in May 2007, he often feared for the dog's safety, and sought to be reunited with him as soon as he retired.

'He was my best friend and my partner in
Iraq,' he said. 'No matter how bad things go in Iraq, I had something 
that loved me unconditionally.

'No doubt Diego would have found a home somewhere, but a home with me is different than with a totally new stranger.'

The veteran launched a Facebook and 
Twitter campaign to find the dog, and located him at Lackland 
Air Force Base in San Antonia, Texas. He learned Diego had been sent back from Iraq in 2008.

He also hoped the dog would be able 
help treat his post traumatic stress disorder, a condition Diego shares 
after years in a war zone.

Black believes Diego developed 
PTSD after an explosive struck the back of a vehicle the pair was riding
in in April 2006. The dog jumped into his handler's lap and shook 
uncontrollably.

'After that attack, any kind of loud noises would send him into a similar state,' Black told Msnbc.

Those
noises included base artillery, gun fire and helicopters but the 
soldier would calm Diego down by giving him his favorite toy, a hard 
rubber cone.

'We were always able to work through it so it never really slowed him down,' he told the station.

Technical 
Sergeant Joseph Null, who runs the adoption program for the 341st 
Training Squadron at Lackland, had previously told Msnbc that Diego performed a vital role right up to his retirement.

'Without dogs like Diego, there would
be no military working dog program,' he told Msnbc. 'Heâ€™s a critical 
asset to developing future dog handlers.'

Last 
year 319 military dogs were adopted, the vast majority by their former handlers.
