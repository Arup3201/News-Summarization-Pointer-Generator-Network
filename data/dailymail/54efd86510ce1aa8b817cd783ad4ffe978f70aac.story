It appears that yesterday's headlines revealing Adrian Chiles and Christine Bleakley's sudden axeing from Daybreak came as just as much a surprise to the hosts as it did to everybody else.

First Bleakley, 32, wrote a sarcastic tweet, posting: 'What a lovely headline to wake up to.'

And now her co-host Chiles, 44, has angrily lashed out at their ITV bosses saying he is 'angry, upset and acutely embarrassed'.

Speaking to the Sunday People newspaper, the presenter reveals that he and Bleakley were informed that their run on the breakfast show would end in the New Year but that 'we were assured we could go with our dignity intact.'

'That’s obviously not happened,' he told the paper. 'We were enjoying the show and we thought things were going well. We didn’t want to go.'

Chiles was pictured looking grim as he watched the Bromwich Albion and Bolton Wanderers game yesterday at The Hawthorns in West Bromwich.

'It was a bolt out of the blue and has come as a big blow to our careers that we’ve been dumped at this time,' Chiles added. 'Dark forces have leaked it for their own ends and I am mightily unhappy about it.'

His equally miffed co-host Christine wrote on her Twitter page this morning: 'Morning, what a lovely headline to wake up to. My sarcasm comes across in this tweet I hope.'

But the Northern Irish presenter, who is engaged to Chelsea footballer Frank Lampard, at least knows where her next pay cheque is coming from.

She was confirmed to be replacing Holly Willoughby as co-host of Dancing on Ice.

Bleakley followed her tweet up with: 'Aside from that, thank you so much for all your Dancing On Ice good luck messages.

'Holly is a legend and she's a tough act to try and follow so feeling really nervous but incredibly excited.'

Bleakley and Chiles, who were heralded as the stars of morning TV when they defected from the BBC last year on £1million-a-year deals, are set to leave ‘within weeks’, it is understood.

Their appearance on Daybreak has failed to capture the public’s imagination.

The programme has struggled to get ratings beyond 700,000 viewers – fewer than its predecessor GMTV.

The move comes after the show recently appointed a new editor and as channel bosses plan for a major revamp in the new year.

It is understood that both Bleakley and Chiles have been told of the decision. Last night ITV refused to deny the claims that the pair would be leaving the show, which had a £15million launch last September.

A senior source at the commercial broadcaster said: 'Do we want to be running a show where we are happy being No 2? No, we don’t.'

Daybreak gets about half the number of viewers as its rival, BBC Breakfast.

Another source said: 'They ran out of time. The advertising numbers had fallen off a cliff because Adrian and Christine were such a turn-off. In today’s climate, that was unacceptable.'

It is not known whether ITV will opt for big names or unknowns as replacement presenters.

According to the report, Chiles, who is 
also the broadcaster’s main presenter for its football coverage, had 
accepted that he had been dropped from the show.

But co-host Miss Bleakley, whose WAG lifestyle was said to have been a turn-off for viewers, is reportedly asking for it to be presented as if she is leaving for new projects.

It is hoped a new role for Miss 
Bleakley will give her a chance to reinvent herself and prove she is a 
valuable member of ITV’s stable of talent.

ITV
bosses have hired former BBC Breakfast editor David Kermode to be the 
show’s new editor, and it is expected other staff will lose their jobs.
