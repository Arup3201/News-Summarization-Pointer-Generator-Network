The end of the summer holidays may be a cause for celebration for some beleaguered parents while for stressed out teachers it may be a reason to turn to the bottle.

But either way, the rows of bottles of alcohol on display at a Tesco store in Swansea certainly weren't meant for school children.

Shoppers at the store in Fforestfach were shocked to see vodka, whisky and gin for sale on shelves underneath a giant sign saying 'Back To School'.

Wrong display: Shoppers at the Fforestfach Tesco in Swansea who were shocked to see rows of bottles of alcohol being sold underneath a Back To School sign

Susan Lloyd, 56, said: 'Maybe they think parents need a stiff one to help them cope with all the stress of a new term.

'Or maybe it's for full-time mums who want to celebrate having a bit more time on their hands.

'It's not the sort of thing you expect to see being sold underneath a display aimed at children.'

Tesco's Back To School range claims to have 'everything you need to get back into the term-time routine'.

Changeover: The supermarket giant explained that the sign would have only been above the alcohol for a few minutes while seasonal displays were changed around

The supermarket's website says: 'We'll
have everything you need from school uniforms to schools bags and shoes
and other back to school essentials.'

But no mention is made of the strong spirits and luxury liquors shown in the photograph.

The picture was posted online by Twitter user James Davies who wrote: 'Think Tesco in Fforestfach need to have a look again.'

A
Tesco spokesman said that bottles of gin were on the shelves instead of
pencil cases and rulers because staff were swapping over their seasonal
displays.

He said: 'This photo was taken whilst our displays were being changed over.

'While we understand that it may have raised a few eyebrows, it would only have looked like this for a few minutes.'

The supermarket giant faced criticism on social networking sites for launching its Christmas range with more than 100 days to go until the big day.

The shelves which just days before were stacked with uniforms and stationary for school children going back to school, have been swapped for festive goodies.

Early bird: Tesco has also faced criticism on Twitter for stocking Christmas goods already. Mince pies and Christmas puddings are pictured at the store in Camberley, Surrey
