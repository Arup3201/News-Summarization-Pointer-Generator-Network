For Germany fans it was the greatest show on earth on Thomas Muller's hat-trick led their team to an emphatic 4-0 win over Portugal in their World Cup opener in Salvador.

Thousands of their supporters, including the nation's Chancellor Angela Merkel who was as animated as anyone, packed the Arena Fonte Nova to witness the victory.

Star striker Lukas Podolski posed for a selfie with his nation's political leader while Merkel visited her delighted players - in various stages of undress - in their dressing room after the match. 

The next best thing to being there was the sitting back in the comfort of the Alte Foersterei FC Union stadium in Berlin.

The
 home of FC Union Berlin has provided an alternative to your soulless 
sofa or a packed pub when it comes to watching the biggest sporting 
event on the globe by allowing punters to bring their own comfy seating 
from home to watch matches.

With more than 700 sofas piled onto their turf the club added wallpaper, lamps and tables to complete the living room feel of the venue for the duration of the tournament.

The venue naturally came into its own when Germany lined up against Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal for their first group G clash on Monday.

After settling in for the evening, the fans weren't disappointed as Joachim Low's side dismantled their hapless opponents who lost stars Hugo Hugo Almeida and Fabio Coentrao to injury, and saw defender Pepe sent off for headbutting Muller with the score at 2-0.

Reigning Golden Boot winner Muller opened the scoring from the spot before finding the net from open play in the first and second halves to nail the first triple of the tournament. The other goals came from defender Mats Hummels.
