Captain Edwin Tritschler (pictured) has been convicted of forging the signature of Lieutenant Commander Christopher Bovill

A captain in the Royal Navy 'deceitfully' forged the signature of an officer who accused him of harassment and bullying in order to 'protect himself' from future complaints.

Captain Edwin Tritschler, 48, of Yeovilton, Somerset, forged the signature of Lieutenant Commander Christopher Bovill on documents to bring an end to the 'never-ending' list of complaints against him.

He has now been convicted of two counts of forgery and cleared of a further count by a board of five male captains at at Portsmouth Military Court Centre.

Tritschler was given a severe reprimand, a full forfeiture of seniority and was fined £5,000 for his 'deliberate' and 'deceitful' actions.

The court heard he used a scanner and a computer to help forge LC Bovill's signature on three separate documents.

The forged appraisal forms were created by Tritschler to show the complaint department he had given clear management advice to Bovill.

The court heard how the pair had a 'difficult' relationship when they were both working on HMS Illustrious from July 4, 2007, when it was based in New York.

Captain Tritschler thought Bovill's performance was 'substandard' while on board the Invincible-class aircraft carrier, Portsmouth Military Court Centre in Hampshire heard.

Meanwhile, Lt Commander Bovill believed Captain Tritschler to be 'abrupt', 'blunt' and accused him of being a 'bully'.

Their feud resulted in Lt Cdr Bovill - who left his Major rank in the Army in 2006 to transfer to the Navy - pursuing the complaint service in the Royal Navy.

Lt Cdr Bovill joined the Navy as senior air engineering officer and was working under Captain Tritschler - who was then a Commander.

Captain Tritschler denied three counts of forgery, but has now been convicted on two counts and cleared of the last charge.

David Richards, prosecuting, said: 'It was clear the two men had a very difficult relationship.

'Captain Tritschler thought Bovill's performance was substandard. Bovill found Tritschler to be officious, abrupt and bullying.

'The disagreement between the two men resulted in Lt Cdr Bovill pursuing the complaint service.'

The court then heard Captain Tritschler - who was head of engineering on board HMS Illustrious - forged Lt Cdr Bovill's signature on three separate documents.

Mr Richards added: 'What the documents appear to show is regular manager advice from Captain Tritschler to Bovill.

'And the documents bear signatures of both men.

'However, the signatures of Bovill were not put there by Bovill. Rather they are copied and forged, possibly using a scanner.

'It was deliberate and deceitful and was quite out of character for a man who has the rank Captain Tritschler does.'

The court heard that when Bovill joined the navy he 'struggled' to cope and noticed Captain Tritschler had an 'abrupt management style'.

Lt Cdr Bovill, who is based at RNAS Culdrose, Cornwall, told the board of five male captains he thought Tritschler was 'blunt'. 

When he realised the signatures on the documents were forged, he reported it and Captain Tritschler was subsequently interviewed.

Mr Richards said: 'Tritschler denied forging the documents and said that Bovill signed them in his presence and that when he signed there were no other witnesses.

'He kept a copy (of the documents) and said it was a 'gypsy warning' to protect himself from other complaints.

'Captain Tritschler generated these false documents in an attempt to bring an end what seemed like a never-ending complaint process.'
