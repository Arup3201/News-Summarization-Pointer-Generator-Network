The total wipeout of English clubs from European competition this week has led to another feverish debate about where our game stands in relation to our continental counterparts.

But before we get too down about things, there is still one Englishman standing in Europe this season.

Manchester City may have crashed out to Barcelona but their on-loan defender Micah Richards is still eyeing European glory with Italian side Fiorentina.

Richards is the only remaining English player in the squads of the 16 teams remaining in the Champions League and the Europa League.

His team produced a stunning performance to beat Serie A rivals Roma 3-0 in the Stadio Olimpico and complete a 4-1 aggregate triumph.

Although Richards was not involved, he has featured in the Europa League this season and helped them knock out another Premier League club, Tottenham, in the round of 32.

Richards, 26, had fallen out of favour under Manuel Pellegrini at City, making just 18 appearances in two seasons and decided to seek greater first-team opportunities in Florence.

And while he has not been a mainstay of Vincenzo Montella's team, he has made 15 appearances across all competitions, almost certainly more than he would have made at City.

England international Richards has admitted he is uncertain where he will be playing his football next season 

Richards could feature in the latter stages of the competition as La Viola bid to win their second European trophy in Warsaw on May 27.

He has been linked with a move to Inter Milan at the end of the season, who are managed by his former City boss Roberto Mancini.

But Richards told talkSPORT on Wednesday: 'It's difficult to say [where I will play] at the moment. Every footballer can go to a bigger club on a free contract but for me, I'm still only 26 and I just want to play every game, that's what's important.'

For now, however, Richards is flying the flag solo for England in European competition.
