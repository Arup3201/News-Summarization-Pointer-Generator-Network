AC Milan bounced back from their disappointing defeat to Genoa with a 2-0  win against Napoli at the San Siro.

But there was no place in the squad for Fernando Torres - who could be heading for a January exit despite being just six months into a two-year loan deal - after the club revealed he was suffering from flu-like symptoms.

Jeremy Menez opened the scoring after just six minutes, some quick thinking and quicker feet took him past Kalidou Koulibaly before calmly finishing his one-on-one with Rafael Cabral.

AC MILAN (4-5-1): Lopez; Bonera, Mexes, Rami (Zapata 66), Armero; Montolivo (Essien 86), De Jong, Poli (Muntari 77), Bonaventura, Honda; Menez.

Subs not used: Abbiati, Agazzi, Albertazzi, El Shaarawy, Pazzini, Saponara, Zaccardo.

Booked: Montolivo, Bonera, Poli. 

Scorers: Menez (6), Bonaventura (52). 

NAPOLI (4-5-1): Cabral; Mesto, Albiol, Koulibaly, Ghoulam; Lopez, Jorginho (Hamsik 61), Callejon, Mertens (Zapata 72), De Guzman (Gargano 77); Higuain. 

Subs not used: Andujar, Britos, Colombo, Henrique, Inler.

Italian international midfielder Giacomo Bonaventura then doubled the hosts' lead seven minutes after the break.

Former France Under 20 international Koulibaly again looked flat-footed as Bonaventura out-jumped the Napoli defender to head in full back Pablo Armero's perfectly-weighted cross at the near post. 

It was a first defeat for Rafael Benitez's side in 11 games, who have now not won a league match since early November when they beat Fiorentina 1-0.

But for the hosts, it was a much needed result after the frustration of their defeat to Genoa, who currently occupy a Europa League spot, last weekend. 

The result means Pippo Inzaghi's side leapfrog the Neapolitans as they move up to sixth in the table.
