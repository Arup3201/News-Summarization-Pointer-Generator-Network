When millionaire property developer Nick Candy popped the question to actress Holly Valance three years ago, little did he know he was helping to unleash a side unheard of in the British male: the hopeless romantic.

His proposal - on a beach in the Maldives with the words, 'Will you marry me' written in fire - suddenly became the benchmark against which all proposals would be judged.

It was also the proposal that changed the lives of two friends - Tiffany Wright and Daisy Amodio.

Walking through Hyde Park one day, they spotted a chap who, hoping to pull off a Candy-style proposal yet lacking the funds, had armed himself with dozens of tea lights with which he spelt out,

'Make me the happiest man in the world' for his girlfriend. 'It was lovely,' says Tiffany, 'except it was so windy the lights kept blowing out and he'd misspelled “happiest”. So we helped him out. When he said, "I don't know what I'd have done without you," a light bulb went off in our heads.'

That moment two years ago led to Tiffany, 33, and Daisy, 32, setting up The Proposers - Britain's first bespoke marriage proposal company. Their exploits are captured in a new series which follows men as they try to come up with the most poignant proposal to spring on their girlfriend.

The chaps, largely, look terrified, the women shell-shocked, and it all makes for highly entertaining TV. 'Before it was fine for men to go down on one knee,' says Daisy, a former advertising executive, 'but people want more of a story now. They want to tell their mates about how they did something a bit crazy.'

That's one way to describe 35-year-old property investor Peter Agate's proposal to girlfriend Cloe.

Having been given a blank cheque, the Proposers organise a Chanel dress and Mulberry bag to be delivered, before a trip by Ferrari, speedboat and helicopter to a chapel where Peter waits with a gospel choir to sing the Keira Knightley wedding scene from Cloe's favourite film, Love Actually.

Noah proposes to Naomi with a flash mob on London's Hungerford Bridge

'He said Cloe wanted to know what it felt like to be a celebrity,' says Tiffany. Other proposals are more simple. Noah, a 23-year-old actor-director, pops the question to his girlfriend Naomi on London's Hungerford Bridge with a flash mob of singers performing Bruno Mars's Just The Way You Are.

Some men simply need saving from themselves. 'One guy wanted to take his girlfriend to a restaurant, excuse himself and then return dressed as the Beast from Beauty And The Beast and sing her a song from the movie,' says Tiffany.

'We asked him if his girlfriend would like it and he said, "No, she's really shy." Then we asked if she liked Beauty And The Beast and he said no, but it was his favourite film, and when we asked him if he could even sing, he said, “Not really, I'm terrible.” Luckily, we managed to persuade him to propose over a picnic in Hyde Park instead.'
