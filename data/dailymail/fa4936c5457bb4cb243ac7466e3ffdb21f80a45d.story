Police arrested a 40-year-old man in a dawn raid today as part of an investigation into overseas terror offences.

Officers from the South East Counter Terrorism Unit, along with colleagues from Sussex Police, held the suspect in Crawley, West Sussex, as part of an investigation into 'conflicts overseas.' 

The arrest is not linked to any immediate threat in the UK, police have said.

Police in patrol cars stood guard outside a semi-detached home in the town this afternoon.

Terror raid: Police have arrested a 40-year-old man at this home in Crawley at dawn this morning over alleged overseas terror offences

A neighbour, who asked not to be named, said the 40-year-old, who was detained in a dawn raid, was a 'really nice family guy who goes about his business.'

He was said to have lived at the home for 'quite a few years.'

A police spokesman said the man was detained under section 11 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and remained in custody while an address was searched.

They added: 'SECTU and Sussex Police would like to reassure residents that the police activity today is part of a normal investigation in relation to conflicts overseas and is not linked to any immediate threat to local communities or anywhere else in the UK.

'We are committed to intervening in activities such as this which cause concern to local communities and we will continue to work with our partners and local communities in order to protect them from individuals and organisations which may seek to exploit them for extremist purposes.'

Reassurance: Police have urged anyone with information about extremism in the area to contact them but said the arrest was not about an immediate threat to the UK

Chief Inspector Justina Beeken, Crawley District commander, urged locals with information about anyone engaging in extremism or the radicalisation of others to contact police.

Anti-terror squads previously swooped on a home in Crawley last February, investigating a suicide bombing thought to have been carried out by a British man in Syria.

The attack on a prison in the city of Aleppo allowed inmates to escape, and its purveyor was named as 41-year-old Abdul Waheed Majeed, who had joined Al Qaeda-inspired militants after travelling from his home town.
