A post-mortem examination found shop worker Miss Pollock, 41, died as a result of strangulation and severe stab wounds to the neck

A 52-year-old builder has been charged with murder following the discovery of a woman's body at a flat. 

Officers found the body of Sarah Pollock, 41, in her flat in the Springbourne area of Bournemouth, Dorset, at 3.26pm on March 25.

Her colleagues raised the alarm when she failed to open the shop she was working for at the Dolphin Centre in Poole.

A post-mortem examination found Miss Pollock died as a result of strangulation and severe stab wounds to the neck.  

Builder Colin Dymond, 52, from Bournemouth, who was known to Miss Pollock, was today charged with her murder.

He will appear before Bournemouth Magistrates' Court tomorrow.

Detective Inspector Mark Samuel, of Dorset Police, said: 'Family liaison officers have updated Sarah's family with this development and the thoughts of the investigation team are with her loved ones.

'Clearly this is a very difficult time for the whole family and they have requested privacy.

'I would also like to thank local people who have been patient and assisted police, particularly some of the residents of Avon Close who have been temporarily relocated.

'Their understanding and co-operation has helped us conduct a thorough investigation into this tragic matter as swiftly as possible.'

At 3.26pm on Wednesday, March 25, Dorset police found the body of the 41-year-old in her flat in Avon Close in the Springbourne area after concerns were raised that she had not arrived at work as expected

Miss Pollock's body was formally identified by family members, who are being supported by police family liaison officers.

Mr Samuel appealed for the public's help to trace the movements of a Peugeot 308 estate hire care with the registration HN14 HWC.

'Although we have charged a man with murder we still want to hear from members of the public if they have any information that could help with the investigation into Sarah's death,' he said.

'We have now recovered the Peugeot hire car from the London area and I am interested if anyone saw it being driven or parked in Dorset or Hampshire between 4pm on Tuesday 24 March and 10pm on Wednesday 25 March 2015. If so, please call Dorset Police urgently.

'We are still building a picture of exactly what happened to Sarah. If anyone saw or heard anything suspicious in the Avon Close area of Bournemouth or has any other information that could be useful, I would urge them to please get in touch.' 

In a statement, Miss Pollock's family said: 'We have lost an important part of our lives; a kind, caring, honest, outgoing and ultimately indescribable daughter, sister and auntie from our close-knit family.

'She was unforgettable and she will always remain in our hearts and minds, although she should not be gone.

'We respectfully ask that we are left to grieve without intrusion and want to thank Dorset Police for their hard work so far in helping our distraught family.'

Anyone with information should contact Dorset Police on 101 quoting Operation Inlet.
