World-renowned musician Duncan McTier (pictured) pleaded guilty to three sexual offences

A world-renowned musician told a teenage pupil 'my wife doesn't understand me', before trying to sexually assault her, a court heard.

Duncan McTier, 59, admitted trying to entice the young woman into a sexual liaison as he pleaded guilty to three sexual offences dating back to the mid 1980s and 1990s.

McTier, who has resigned as Professor of Double Bass at the Royal Academy of Music in London, escaped jail after admitting the attempted indecent assault and two further counts of indecent assault as he was about to go on trial at Liverpool Crown Court.

Each of the victims were highly gifted musicians and pupils of McTier who taught at various prestigious music schools across the UK.

He touched two of his victims' breasts over their clothing and on the other occasion put his arm around another pupil.

Divorced father-of-two McTier, of Isleworth, west London, was given a three-month jail term on each count, suspended for two years and ordered to do 240 hours community service.

McTier is recognised as one of the world's foremost double bass soloists and teachers.

Passing sentence Mr Justice MacDuff said: 'You will never be able to hold your head as high in society again and that is to your shame but also your punishment.

'It's a long time ago, but that behaviour as you know was shameful and horrid for somebody who had the trust of students and took advantage of your position, or tried to, because you could influence their potential careers and that's what makes this the more serious.

'You took steps to try to begin sexual liaisons with three of your students.

'At the time it must have been an awful experience for them, how to deal with you.'

Peter Cadwallader, prosecuting, told the court the first offence in 1985 involved a young music student.

After a music lesson McTier, then aged 30 or 31 and married, began drinking wine and invited the 17-year-old to sit with him on a sofa.

Mr Cadwallader said: 'By that stage he was drunk and was using lines which can perhaps be summarised as, "my wife doesn't understand me".'

McTier then put his arm around her and she 'froze' and this continued for 20 minutes.

He later made a 'drunken grab' for her breasts which she knocked away.

Two months later she warned her attacker: 'Don't ever do that to me again.'

Later he smirked and told her she would not be successful in getting a prestigious musical position.

The victim said: 'Is it because I won't sleep with every male member?'

To which McTier replied: 'That's about right,' the court heard.

His second victim was a student aged in her early 20s

During a lesson in the summer of 1988 after drinking wine he again put his arm around the young woman and this time touched her breast over her clothing.

The 'shocked' victim 'did not want to make a fuss', Mr Cadwallader said - but left immediately.

His final victim was also aged in her early 20s and having a lesson from McTier in March 1994 while he was teaching.

Both were sat on a sofa when 'out of the blue' he lunged at her, again touching the young woman's breast over her clothing.

Again the victim got up and left.

David Toal, mitigating, said the prosecution has had a 'significant impact' on McTier, having resigned from the Royal Academy, he has also lost other teaching work due to the publicity.

Mr Toal added: 'He's a different individual from the one who has acted in the way described.

'His life is a world away from the dock of a criminal crown court, in every other respect he's a decent, law abiding citizen.'

A formal not guilty verdict was recorded on a fourth charge of attempted indecent assault against McTier.

McTier was arrested by Greater Manchester Police (GMP) in an investigation triggered by the conviction last year of Michael Brewer, former director of music at Chetham's School of Music in Manchester.

Brewer was found guilty of sexually assaulting Frances Andrade, a pupil at the school, from the age of 14. She killed herself after giving evidence against him.

A spokesman for the Royal Academy of Music said: 'In May 2014 Duncan McTier was charged by police regarding historic cases of sexual abuse in Manchester before his employment at the Royal Academy of Music.

'During his bail Duncan McTier was placed on a precautionary suspension from duty at the academy. 

'He has now resigned from the academy with immediate effect.'
