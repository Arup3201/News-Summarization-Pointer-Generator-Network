On 1 March, Samsung and HTC are separately hosting events in Barcelona, to kick off this year’s Mobile World Congress (MWC). HTC is expected to unveil its HTC One M9, while Samsung will likely use its event to announce the Samsung Galaxy S6. Samsung's invite hints at a curved device (pictured)

HTC’s event begins at 4pm CET (3pm GMT and 10am ET) and its green and blue invitation says: ‘Utopia in progress. Join us to see what’s next.’

Samsung’s invitation is black and features a white line with a curve at the end, with the words ‘what’s next.’

Its event starts at 6.30pm CET (5.30pm GMT and 12.30 ET) and will be streamed live on YouTube.

In terms of what will be announced. Rumours suggest HTC will use the event to unveil its next flagship phone, dubbed HTC One M9.

It will be the follow up to the One M8, released at last year’s MWC, and leaked specifications suggest it will include the 64-bit octa-core Snapdragon 810 processor and a 5-inch screen.

The leaks also claim the next-generation device will include 3GB of RAM, run the latest version of Android, and feature a 20.7MP rear-facing camera.

Meanwhile, Samsung's next generation Galaxy handset could have a curved screen that covers both its sides.

The handset, which is expected to have a 5.5-inch screen to rival Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus, will come in a 'special edition' version with the curved technology, according to Sammobile.

The Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over Apple, and the curved screen has already been used in Samsung's Note Edge.

However, S6 Edge will have the ability to work in a left or right handed mode.

Previous leaks from BGR said the SM-G925F, the codename believed to be assigned to the Galaxy S6, will feature a Quad HD, 2560 x 1440 resolution, display.

It will also have an octa-core processor, Mali-T768 graphics processing unit, and a 16MP rear-facing camera. 

Samsung surprised audiences at the Berlin-based trade show IFA in September when it unveiled its curved device. 

The screen was described by Samsung's David Park at the event as working like a 'ticker', with notifications and news scrolling along it

The Galaxy Note Edge's unique curved touchscreen provides quick access to frequently used apps and alerts.

The curved screen displays notifications at the top and bottom, while viewing a video without disruption, for example.

Because the curved edge remains visible even if a flip-book style protective cover is used, it is easier to keep up-to-date with incoming calls and messages. 

Previous leaks from BGR said the SM-G925F - the codename used for the Galaxy S6 - will feature a 2560 x 1440 resolution display, octa-core processor, Mali-T768 graphics processing unit, and a 16MP rear-facing camera.

In December, in the face of stiff competition, and following a consecutive drop in profits, Samsung announced plans to curb the number of phones it makes each year.

Earlier this week, HTC America posted this video on YouTube. It's a rap parody poking fun at Samsung and Apple. Lyrics include: 'More than a few clowns stole what we originated. We own the universe, your Galaxy is overrated', and 'It took you copycats six times to get it right/My One M8 is great, you’ll never touch this light'

Meanwhile, Samsung's next generation Galaxy handset could have a curved screen that covers both its sides. The handset is also expected to have a 5.5-inch screen to rival Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus. Samsung's Galaxy Note Edge (pictured) was the first to use a curved screen when it was unveiled in Berlin last year

Instead of releasing handset after handset and saturating the market with Samsung devices, the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets, better. 

The South Korean manufacturer is also expected to ramp up production of its remaining models so they can be sold more cheaply. 

The strategy was unveiled during a presentation in New York by Samsung's head of investor relations, Robert Yi.

He said the company would reduce the number of smartphone models in 2015 by between a quarter and a third.  

In a rare acknowledgement, Mr Yi added that Samsung had lagged behind changing market conditions.

The company moved the launch of the Galaxy Note 4, a large smartphone with a stylus, to late September from October after Apple unveiled the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. 

It also began sales of the Galaxy Note 4 in China last month, getting an early start in the world's most populous country before Apple.

Apple released it first phablet-style devices in September, and it appears the gamble paid off. 

During the first quarter of 2015, Apple announced it sold a staggering 74.5 million iPhones in the same quarter - up from 51 million during the same period a year ago. 

These was the first quarter that the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were on sale. 

However, sales of iPads dropped by 18 per cent, which knocked Apple's revenue in that sector by 22 per cent. 

This was the largest year-on-year decrease released by Apple.

The decline has been blamed on a dip in tablet popularity in general, as well as the rising popularity of phablets. 

As phones increase in size, and close the gap between the size of tablet displays, analysts predict fewer people will buy, or need, the two gadgets. 

The company's response 'was not quick enough,' said Mr Yi.
