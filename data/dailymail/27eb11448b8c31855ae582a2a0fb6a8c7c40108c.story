Cambridge graduate Svetlana Lokhova is expected to claim up to £5million in compensation after claiming sexual harassment at an employment tribunal

A high-flying banker nicknamed ‘Crazy Miss Cokehead’ during a smear campaign by male colleagues has won an employment tribunal after claiming she faced sexual harassment.

Cambridge graduate Svetlana Lokhova worked in the London office of Russian firm Sberbank and said she had been subjected to victimisation before being unfairly dismissed.

Last night it was unclear how much the 32-year-old can expect in compensation, but it was believed she was planning to claim as much as £5million.

The tribunal heard that colleagues referred to her as ‘mad Svetlana’ and told her to visit Nigeria for sex with tribesmen to ‘calm her down’.

Other phrases male co-workers used to describe her included ‘crazy’, ‘mental’, ‘totally unstable’, ‘quite likely clinically bonkers’ and a ‘MAJOR car crash’.

Miss Lokhova claimed she had been targeted because she had previously reported a senior trader for insider dealing. He was later dismissed.

The tribunal also ruled that her main tormentor should have been fired from the bank for gross misconduct.

David Longmuir, Miss Lokhova’s former manager at Sberbank CIB (UK) Ltd, not only sent a host of emails but also made remarks behind her back that were ‘offensive and derogatory and often personal in nature’.

He referred to Miss Lokhova as ‘Miss Bonkers’, said she had ‘unfortunate natural brain chemistry’ and described the daughter of a Russian shipping broker as ‘living in a flat that Daddy bought’.

Mr Longmuir told the tribunal he regretted making some comments but claimed Miss Lokhova had insulted him. He has since reportedly left the bank by ‘mutual consent’.

The tribunal rejected 19 of the 22 complaints made by Miss Lokhova but found in her favour on the substantive areas of harassment and intimidation on the grounds of her gender.

Judges said there was no evidence over claims that she was put under surveillance by the bank, that she had not been paid the relevant sick pay while off work and that she had been put on a list of ‘underperformers’ because of her poor relationship with Mr Longmuir.

Miss Lokhova worked in Sberbank's Fleet Street office where she claimed she was victimised before being unfairly dismissed

Miss Lokhova made her allegations 
after a second term of working at Sberbank’s London office in 2011, when
she was earning a six-figure salary alongside a guaranteed annual bonus
of £200,000.

However, in 
January 2012 she went on leave because of stress, claiming there was a 
‘hostile environment’ on the male-dominated equity sales desk.

On the day she resigned senior analyst Mikhail Stiskin said in an email to a colleague that Miss Lokhova should visit Nigeria.

He
wrote that he ‘knew a few tribe leaders in Nigeria … proper alpha 
male … she needs to relax after the stressful period of the past months.
These guys would help’.

Miss
Lokhova’s barrister, Andrew Stafford, QC, said many comments showed a 
‘demeaning and offensive attitude towards women in general and to Miss 
Lokhova in particular’.

Mr Longmuir said he now accepted that describing Miss Lokhova as ‘Crazy Miss Cokehead’ was both untrue and defamatory of a woman who had never taken drugs.

The Central London Employment Tribunal heard that prior to leaving the bank, Miss Lokhova had generated £20million in profits during two stints with the company and on one occasion had even been awarded a £600,000 cash bonus.

Paolo Zaniboni, who was in charge of the London office, 'failed to manage properly the severity of the situation as it developed'

Sberbank, the former Soviet savings bank, has been transformed under Herman Gref, a former economy minister for Russian president Vladimir Putin.

The bank is Russia’s largest lender, held almost half of the nation’s deposits last year and has diversified into investment banking and asset management.

The resources of Sberbank and its subsidiary Troika Dialog UK, where Miss Lokhova worked, have  now been integrated under  Sberbank CIB (UK) Ltd.

The tribunal ruled that Paolo Zaniboni, who was in charge of the London office, also ‘failed to manage properly the situation as it developed with Mr Longmuir’.

It added: ‘His lamentable  inaction caused detriment to the claimant and amounts in our view to victimisation .

‘What he should have done was to suspend Mr Longmuir and ensure that a proper disciplinary process was taken against him.’

Damages awarded by the tribunal are normally capped at £70,000 but they are unlimited in discrimination cases.

Miss Lokhova is the second woman to win a sexual discrimination lawsuit in London this year. Isabel Sitz, a former stock broker at Oppenheimer Europe, won her claim for unfair treatment after managers discussed cutting her £95,000 a year salary to the UK legal minimum wage before she was then fired.

The 32-year-old was called a 'car crash' and 'mentally unstable' by male colleagues, the tribunal heard. Nineteen of the 22 complaints made by Miss Lokhova were rejected by the Central London Employment Tribunal

Last night Sberbank’s spokesman Paul Marriott said in a statement: ‘Sberbank CIB and the management team in London are committed to equal opportunities and promoting diversity in its workplace, and did not expect this decision.

‘Although pleased that the tribunal found no wrongdoing on the part of the firm or its employees in relation to 19 complaints made by the claimant, we are disappointed that the tribunal upheld a small number of allegations.

Miss Lokhova claimed she was unfairly dismissed from the Russian firm Sberbank, the largest bank in Eastern Europe

‘We cannot comment further on the specifics of the judgment, which we are reviewing closely with our legal team, but we are committed to take on board any lessons to be learned.’

Miss Lokhova was unavailable for comment yesterday.
