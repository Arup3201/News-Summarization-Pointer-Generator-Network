NFL player Desmond Bryant may have a lucrative new contract, but his legal troubles are far from over as he's been sued over an incident that spawned one the world's most bizarre mugshots.

A lawsuit seeking unspecified damages was filed yesterday in Miami-Dade circuit court against Bryant, 27, who inked a five-year, $34million deal with the Cleveland Browns last week.

Bryant told police that he thought he was at his home when a taxi dropped him off after a night of drinking in Miami in the early morning hours of February 24.

But it wasn't his house. It was the home of Isaac Bakar, a 43-year-old contractor who thought the massive athlete was there to rob the place.

At 5'11" and 173 pounds, Mr Bakar struggled to hold the door to keep the 6'6" and 311-pound defensive lineman from entering while his wife called 911.

The Bakars charge that Bryant tried to break down the door, and even ripped off a door handle.

The family's attorney, Robert Fiore, told the Miami Herald: 'They were scared. My client was holding on for dear life.

The paper reported that Bryant was still furiously punching at the door when cops arrived.

He was arrested and charged with misdemeanor criminal mischief, and later released after posting $1,000 bail.

The lineman's peculiar booking photo from the February incident, which shows him shirtless and with his mouth gaping open, has since become an internet phenomenon.

The defensive lineman has apologized for his arrest last month, saying the incident was a 'mistake' and that 'it's really not the kind of person that I am.'

But the Bakars' attorney says it's a mistake he'll have to pay for, telling the Herald: 'We allege that Mr Bryant made more than a simple, inconsequential mistake, and that Mr Bryantâ€™s conduct has significant legal consequences.'

Bryant said he's moved on from the incident, and Browns CEO Joe Banner said the team has no concerns about Bryant's character.

Representatives for Bryant could not immediately be reached for comment.
