A Boston gang member who posted photos of himself on Twitter holding guns after being banned from having weapons is set to be sentenced to prison today.

Convicted felon Kwmaine Davis, 23, posted two photos of himself holding the guns at a firing range in Salisbury in March.

A Boston police officer who had been secretly following Davis on Twitter saw the photos.

Davis pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. 

His lawyers and prosecutors have agreed to recommend 18 months in prison as part of a plea agreement.

Davis had been convicted of illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition in 2009. That felony conviction made it illegal for him to possess a gun, even at a firing range.

He was originally convicted of being associated with H-Bloc, a gang that operates in Roxbury. 

The H-Block gang, so called because it operates in an area just north of Franklin Park where most of the street names begin with H, is well-known to police.

The Smoking Gun reports that its members wear silver and black clothing emblazoned with the Raiders logo.

Police say Davis's target practice was 'intended to increase his firearm proficiency for illegal purposes rather than for any sporting or recreational reason.'
