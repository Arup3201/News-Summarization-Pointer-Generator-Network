Scott Peterson horrified the nation when he was convicted 10 years ago for murdering his 8-months-pregnant wife Laci and their unborn son Conner. 

While he was sentenced to death for the crime, the likelihood that the 42-year-old will actually be executed is unlikely in California where the last death row inmate was killed in 2006.

Perhaps most shocking though is the fact that Peterson lives a relatively 'cushy' life at the Bay Area's 163-year-old San Quentin prison - which houses the largest death row population in the nation.

Fox News spoke with Nancy Mulane, author of 'Life After Murder: Five Men in Search of Redemption', who is one of the few outsiders who have been able to witness Peterson's life behind bars. 

Mulane says Peterson is living in an 'exclusive' part of the historic prison, in a single cell with the ability to socialize with other prisoners on a roof deck with a half basketball court.

'I saw this quite, I would have to say, buff-looking young man with his shirt off,' Mulane said. 'And he was playing basketball. He looked like you were watching some college athletes out on a neighborhood court play basketball.' 

'You've been around a lot of prisons,' Fox News' Geraldo Rivera remarked. 'It sounds to me like what you describe is the cushiest environment that you've seen.'

Mulane went on to add that there are many death row prisoners in California who spend 23 of the 24 hours in a day locked in their cells.  

'They are not having the life Scott Peterson is having. Scott Peterson has an exclusive life inside San Quentin,' Mulane said.

Life in prison? Peterson was sentenced to death for the murder, but his execution looks unlikely in California where a death row inmate hasn't been killed since 2006

Peterson's comfortable accommodations add insult to Laci and Conner's deaths, since he has also shown no remorse for the crime. 

Laci Peterson was reported missing on December 24, 2002. In the early days of the search, family and friends supported her husband Scott, believing he had nothing to do with her disappearance.

But that changed when it was revealed less than a month later that Scott had been having extramarital affairs, and had even struck up a relationship with a massage therapist who didn't even know he was married.

The fetus of the Peterson's unborn child was found in April 2003, after washing up on the shoreline of San Francisco Bay north of the Berkeley Marina.

The next day, a woman's torso belonging to Laci was also recovered. Prosecutors argued that the state the bodies were in indicated that Laci was suffocated or strangled to death.

Peterson was sentenced to death on March 16, 2005 for the crime, with the judge calling the murder of Laci 'cruel, heartless and callous'.
