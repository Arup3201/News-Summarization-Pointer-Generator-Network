This year saw football fans treated to a plethora of enthralling competitions and memorable matches typified by an enthralling World Cup in Brazil.

With each calender year that passes, a handful of truly memorable goals are scored by some of the biggest names in sport as well as some of the lesser known talents across the globe. 

From Robin van Persie's gravity-defying header against Spain to Rogelio Chavez's 60-yard strike for Mexican side Cruz Azul, there were some beauties. Here, Sportsmail picks 10 of the best goals from 2014.

JAMES RODRIGUEZ – COLOMBIA 2-0 Uruguay (World Cup, 28/06/14)

One of the most iconic moments of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil produced by the star of the tournament. A neat, cushioned header was played to Rodriguez who was facing away from goal. 

The Colombian set himself, positioned his body to chest-control the ball, before turning and unleashing an unstoppable left-footed volley into the top corner of the net from 25 yards. Utterly incredible.

ROBIN VAN PERSIE – Spain 1-5 HOLLAND (World Cup, 13/06/14)

This goal gets a place in the list because it really was quite extraordinary. In terms of the context of the match, Van Persie’s header totally changed it in the favour of the Dutch – who roared back to demolish the defending champions 5-1. 

But the technique itself was also exquisite. A long, diagonal ball was played in behind the Spain defence and Van Persie, after just arriving in the box, arched his back and completely threw himself off the ground to lob a header over the top of Iker Casillas and into the net from 16 yards. A quite unique finish.

AARON RAMSEY – Galatasaray 1-4 ARSENAL (Champions League, 09/12/14)

This goal produced a one of those ‘Oh my goodness – did that actually just happen?’ moments. Joel Campbell’s corner was extremely poor and was headed towards what appeared like relative safety by the Galatasaray defence. 

However, Ramsey caught the ball on the half-volley  and arrowed an unstoppable effort from 30 yards into the very top left-hand corner of the net. The accuracy and precision of the shot was masterful. An absolute bullet.

ANGEL DI MARIA – Leicester City 5-3 MANCHESTER UNITED (Premier League, 21/09/14)

Many people questioned the logic in Manchester United paying £60million for another attacking midfielder last summer when it was their defence they needed to focus on, but Di Maria proved his class in this one goal alone.

Picking the ball up in his own half, he advanced 25 yards before passing to Wayne Rooney. After continuing his run to the edge of the box, Di Maria received a return ball from Rooney and, with two Leicester defenders closing him down, dug his foot under the ball from just inside the area and deliciously chipped Kasper Schmeichel, who was three yards off his line. Quite audacious.

JONJO SHELVEY – SWANSEA CITY 4-1 Aston Villa (Premier League, 26/04/14)

Brad Guzan will not remember this one fondly, but Shelvey certainly will. Aston Villa keeper Guzan had thrown the ball out to his defence and certainly did not expect it to be in the back of his net just moments later.

Despite Villa’s deficiencies leading to this goal, nothing can be taken away from Shelvey’s strike though. After controlling the failed clearance on his chest a fully 50-yards out, the midfielder waited for the ball to bounce back up before belting a shot with the outside of his right foot that swerved and dipped into the top right-hand corner of the net. Brilliant for Shelvey, embarrassing for Villa.

MOTAZ SALHANI – Al-Ramtha 0-1 AL-WEHDAT (Jordan Premier League, 15/03/14)

This goal is so unique that it is actually quite hard to describe. Salhani was running forward and was halfway into the Al-Ramtha half before a chipped through-ball was seemingly played too far behind him. 

The Al-Wehdat forward was not put off, however, and stuck his right leg behind his body, flicking the ball into the air and it flew over the top of the Al-Ramtha keeper and into the net from 25 yards. Was it intentional? Possibly not, but it was still exceptional.

FABIAN KWOK – Albirez Niigata 4-2 GEYLANG INTERNATONAL (S.League, 08/05/14)

Kwok will never, ever hit a ball more sweetly than this. There seemed to be little danger as the Albirex Niigata goalkeeper cleared the ball to Geylang International’s Kwok during this match in Singapore, but suddenly the ball was in the back of the net. 

With the ball still travelling at some speed in the air after the goalkeeper’s clearance, Kwok smashed a right-footed volley from inside the centre circle. It went high into the air and then dipped into the left-hand corner of the Niigata net, with the goalkeeper sent sprawling.

It seems to have been just a one of those ‘swing it and see what happens' shots, but credit where it is due.

AITOR ASPAS – Celta Vigo B 3-1 CORUXO FC (Segunda B, 18/01/14)

All Liverpool fans will be thinking after seeing this is, if Iago Aspas’ cousin can score wondergoals like this, have the Reds bought the wrong family member? After picking the ball up in his own half, Aspas suddenly decided he was going to have a go against Celta Vigo B. 

He advanced past two players, then another couple, weaving in and out exquisitely, before breaking through the defence and gently chipping a shot over the advancing goalkeeper. 

In total, Aspas beat seven players and travelled more than 60 yards with the ball before scoring. How Liverpool fans long to see that from Iago...

BLAISE MATUIDI – FRANCE 2-0 Holland (International Friendly, 05/03/14)

Sometimes goals are special because they look bizarre, and this is one of those occasions. Mathieu Valbuena had attacked down the right-hand side for France against Holland before playing a chipped cross into the box. 

The ball was slightly behind Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Matuidi, but the Frenchman arched his body and then jumped into the air, both feet off the ground, before meeting the cross with the inside of his right foot as he feel backwards the other way.

It flew into the back of the net and was a very unusual example of a bicycle kick. Certainly not your orthodox, everyday goal anyway.

ROGELIO CHAVEZ – Queretaro 1-3 CRUZ AZUL (Liga MX, 22/02/14)

This is surely the finest goal scored in Mexico in 2014. Chavez was five yards into his own half taking and throw-in and, after a Queretaro midfielder managed to win the header, it flew back towards the Cruz Azul right back.

Despite being practically on the halfway line and just two yards from the side of the pitch, Chavez had spotted the Queretaro goalkeeper off his line and decided to launch both feet off the ground and smash a left-footed effort which looped high into the air, before fooling the Queretaro goalkeeper – who could not tip it over – and bouncing in via the post. Audacious, ambitious and utterly brilliant.
