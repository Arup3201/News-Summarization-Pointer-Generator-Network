A mother has made an emotional appeal to her husband's family to return her young daughter, who was taken to Libya in a 'tug-of-love' battle between the parents.

Mal Szymanowicz's daughter Talia was snatched by Maher Belaid - Ms Szymanowicz's estranged husband - in 2012 and taken to his home country in North Africa.

Belaid was jailed for Talia's kidnap last year after returning to Britain without his little daughter, who remains in Libya with his family and now calls her paternal grandmother 'mum'.

Belaid has refused to comply with a court order to bring the little girl back to the UK to see Ms Szymanowicz, who has now been separated from the youngster for more than two years.

Ms Szymanowicz has now made a desperate plea for help in having her daughter returned to her home in Barry, south Wales.

She said: 'My heart is broken, I can't even put my pain into words. I wonder if I will ever see my beautiful daughter again.

'I cry every single day for her. She was only-15-weeks old when she was stolen, now she is two. Its so long since I held her in my arms, they feel so empty.

'What Belaid has done is beyond cruel. He has deprived Talia of a mother and me of my only child. It's a physical pain that never goes away.'

'It's like being in a never-ending nightmare - there must be someone out there who can help me get my baby girl back.'

Ms Szymanowicz came to Britain from Poland in 2002 and met Libyan national Belaid, who working in a pizza takeaway, and they got married and had a child together.

Their marriage - the only thing which allowed Belaid to stay in the UK - broke down soon after Talia was born when Belaid spent three weeks in Libya with his family.

Ms Szymanowicz was  shopping in Mothercare when her then-15-week-old daughter  was taken by Belaid.

Nearly two children a day are taken out of the UK against a court order or without the consent of one parent, figures show.

Foreign Office data reveals the number of parental child abduction cases has  doubled in the last decade, from 272 in 2004 to 580 in 2013.

The most common destination countries for parental abductions from the UK in 2013 were Pakistan, where 35 were taken, the US, where 32 children went, and Poland, which saw 29 abductions.

Foreign Office minister Mark Simmonds said at the time a report into the issue: 'Once children are taken overseas it can be extremely difficult to secure their return.'

She said: 'It was an ordinary day and we went shopping as a family into town.

'While I was buying new clothes for Talia my husband said he would go for a coffee with Talia but instead he kidnapped her and took her to Libya.'

In a phone call made from Tunisia shortly after the kidnapping, Belaid told Ms Szymanowicz he was 'teaching her a lesson'.

Ms Szymanowicz has been apart from her daughter since November 2012 - and has only seen her during brief Skype calls.

She attempted to visit the chaotic country soon after the abduction but was advised against it a because, as a western woman travelling alone, she would not be safe.

Little Talia, now two, is being looked after by Belaid's Libyan family and calls her grandmother 'mum'.

Ms Szymanowicz says the family often hang up when she calls or refuse to let her speak to or see her daughter. 

She added: 'I've been allowed to see her on Skye for a few minutes but she now calls my husband's mother "mum". She doesn't even really know who I am.'

Belaid returned to the UK earlier this year, but didn't bring Talia with him, he was arrested at Gatwick airport for abuction.

Cardiff Crown Court heard how his baby snatch was inspired by his uncle Mohammed who also stayed in Libya with his young daughter and not allowed her to return to Britain.

Judge Patrick Harrington QC told Belaid to return Talia to the UK but he refused to co-operate.

He said: 'You put into effect a cruel deception and the torment you have inflicted on a very nice girl is simply beyond measure. Rarely have I seen a case of such unspeakable cruelty.'

The judge took the rare step of apologising for not being able to jail Belaid for longer, saying he would have given him a 'far, far longer' jail term if not for legal restrictions on his sentencing powers.

There is currently no prospect of Talia being returned home, although Ms Szymanowicz has written to the Prime Minister and the British Embassy in Libya begging for help.
