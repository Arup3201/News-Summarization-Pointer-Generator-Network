A British runner has won the North Korean half marathon after getting a Kim Jong-Un-style haircut to pass the rigid pre-race inspection.

Will Marks, 30, from Stafford, sported the sleek short back and sides, which every North Korean man must now wear by law, after the event was opened to foreigners for the first time.

Mr Marks collected his winners medal in front of 70,000 cheering supporters in the capital Pyongyang on Sunday after completing the course in one hour and 23 minutes.

Winner: British runner Will Marks has triumphed in the North Korean half marathon after the event was opened to foreigners for the first time

He told the BBC: 'You had to run 500 metres around the track to the 
finish. The stadium was packed and the crowds were all 
chanting and clapping.

'It was as surreal an experience as you 
can imagine. It was like standing in the middle of Wembley. It was like 
you had just won an Olympic gold.'

Around 150 foreign runners are believed to have taken part. After arriving in the deeply secretive nation they were ordered to change into their race gear and present themselves for an inspection.

Mr Marks, who lives in China,decided to enter the event after hearing about it through his running club in Shanghai.

He spent three days in Pyongyang during which time he was not allowed to travel around the city unaccompanied.

HeÂ  added: 'I have just turned 30 and I'm keen to try as many new experiences as I 
can.

'It was very expensive to go there but I thought it was 
totally worth it.'

'Some people had to get changed out of their running gear because it had
 logos which the officials thought were too big.

'One 
guy had to do the race in his jeans.'

On Monday around 200 foreign competitors took part in a full marathon around the same Pyongyang streets.

In March this year the North Korean regime issued a strict diktat that all young men should have short back and sides haircuts like their dear leader Kim Jong-Un.

It followed a five-part mini series broadcast on North Koprean State Television entitled 'Let us trim our hair in accordance with Socialist lifestyle' with the aim of promoting short back and sides for its male population.

Earlier this week British hairdresser sparked a diplomatic incident when he placed a cheeky poster in his window with a picture of Kim Jong-Un to publicise special discounts for people having a 'bad hair day'.
