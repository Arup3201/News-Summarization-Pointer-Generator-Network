When Carmen Waters took her dog for a walk with her boyfriend on Sunday, she thought it was just like any other weekend.

She didn't even think twice when her boyfriend Kane Thomas pointed out a plane flying past with a banner saying 'CARMEN WILL YOU MARRY ME?'

'I looked up and saw and thought "Oh look there's banner, maybe someone's proposing," not even thinking,' Ms Waters told the Daily Mail Australia.

Kane Thomas and Carmen Waters got engaged in Mona Vale in Sydney's northern suburbs on Sunday

Mr Thomas, 25, proposed to Ms Waters, 21, with a plane and sky banner

'I even saw the name Carmen and thought "That's a coincidence" but didn't think it was for me.

'Then I turned around and he was down on one knee.'

Ms Waters, a 21-year-old childcare worker from Mona Vale in Sydney's northern beaches, said she was in complete shock – especially when she realised their friends and family were in on the surprise and were waiting nearby.

'I said yes – obviously – then he made a phone call, and my family and his family were waiting around the corner and they all came over,' she said.

'Everyone was really excited and emotional.

Mr Thomas had been trying to propose for weeks but kept having to cancel his grand gesture because of rainy weather

The couple met at a party and have been together for four years

'Then as we were standing there like 100 dolphins swam past - it couldn't have been more perfect.'

Mr Thomas, a 25-year-old concrete pumper, had been trying to propose at the Mona Vale Headland Reserve for weeks but had to cancel three times because of rainy weather.

Last month Sydney experienced its wettest August in 16 years.

'It was the first sunny day in ages so apparently he rang everyone and was like "It's on, it's today!"' she said.

Their family and friends were waiting around the corner, and ran out to surprise Ms Waters after she said yes

'I can't believe everyone can keep secrets from me this well, that makes me worried!'

Ms Waters said she was so surprised because she thought she would be able to tell when Mr Thomas was planning to propose.

'I honestly thought I would have some sort of sign, I know him so well I thought he wouldn't be able to keep it from me,' she said.

'I didn't think we'd be doing a day-to-day thing, but we were just doing something we always do.'

Later in the day the couple (pictured centre and second from right) celebrated their engagement with friends

Ms Waters described Mr Thomas as 'the perfect boyfriend'

After the proposal the couple, who met at a party almost four years ago, took plenty of photos with their friends and family before going out to lunch in Manly.

There was also a second surprise in store – Mr Thomas had organised for all their friends to celebrate the engagement at a nearby pub that afternoon.

'He is the perfect boyfriend and I've been living with him for three years and I can still say that,' she said.

'He's amazing, my parents absolutely adore him, he just treats me like I'm a princess.'

The couple are planning to get married on October 31 next year - their five-year anniversary - somewhere on Sydney's northern beaches.
