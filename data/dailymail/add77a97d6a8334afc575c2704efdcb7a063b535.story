A man has surrendered to police in connection with
the hit-and-run death of a grandmother who pushed her grandson to safety before
she was mowed down by an SUV.

Brian McGurk, 40, was charged with fleeing the scene of Thursday's accident in New York and held on a $50,000 bond.

The expectant father was wearing a hoodie and sported an overgrown goatee and while he was in court his black Ford Escape SUV was sat in his driveway with its hood badly dented from the accident which killed 57-year-old Clara Almazo.

'I
thought it was two cars hitting each other — it was that loud,' said Janet
Romero to the New York Post of the tragic crash that she heard while inside her home around 10pm
in West Brighton on Staten Island.

Rushing
outside, Romero said she was confronted with the heart-breaking scene of Almazo’s
daughter, Berta, and Berta’s eight-year old son Brian in floods of tears.

Witnesses
to the crash reported that Almazo pushed little Brian out of the way just
seconds before McGurk’s SUV ran into their path outside Almazo’s home.

The three
family members had been returning from Holy Thursday’s Catholic mass and were
just feet away from their home.

Immediately
following the horror smash Berta laid her son down on the floor and was screaming
‘My mother, my mother!’ said Romero.

‘I asked
her where her mom was, and she said, "Over there, over there!"'

Rushing
150 feet from where the SUV hit the heroic grandmother, Romero found Almazo
lying motionless on the ground.

‘She was
face up. Her leg was broken at the knee,’ said a tearful Romero to the New York Post.

‘I
recognised who she was, and I told her, "Wake up, wake up, please wake up!"

‘When I
looked into her eyes, I knew she was gone.’

Rushing
away from the scene, McGurk did not choose to stay and face the consequences.

Upon the
police arriving, Romero let them see a video of the crash that had been caught
on surveillance cameras at her home.

‘The cops
were shocked when they watched the video in my house,’ said Romero.

‘They
gasped at the impact. It was terrible.’

However,
some hours later McGurk turned himself in to police and there was no indication
that he had been drinking.

Furious
family members have rounded on McGurk for his actions.

‘He’s a
criminal. He has taken the heart out of our family,’ said Emilio Herrera,
Almazo’s son.

‘She
loved all of us with her whole heart.’

Scene of the crime: The accident occurred on Staten Island on Thursday

The
family have hired a lawyer who will now likely seek legal action against
McGurk.

The
brother of Almazo was equally distraught at losing his sister.

‘He needs
to pay for what he did,’ said Odilon Almazo.

In a past
court appearance in 2009, McGurk exposed his wife’s secret life as a belly
dancer during a trial in which she claimed she could not work because of injuries sustained from a car accident.

His wife,
Dorothy, was seeking a lifetime of alimony payments to the tune of $850 a month
from her estranged husband.

A judge
sided with McGurk and he was ordered to pay $400 a month for two years instead.

He also
received 60 percent from the sale of their house and thousands of dollars in
legal fees because of his ex-wife’s ‘dilatory tactics.’

Almazo’s
grandson Brian was still in Richmond University Hospital yesterday with a broken foot according to his mother, Berta.
