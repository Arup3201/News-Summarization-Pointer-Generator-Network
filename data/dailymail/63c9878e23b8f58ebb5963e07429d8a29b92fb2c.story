On trial: Neville Neville, the father of England footballers Gary and Phil, stands accused of sexual assault which his alleged victims claims happened when she dropped him home

The father of former Manchester United and England footballers Gary and Phil Neville sexually assaulted a woman after having 'far too much to drink' and told her 'I like the chase', a jury heard today.

Neville Neville, 63, is on trial at Bolton Crown Court accused of a single count of assault by penetration after the woman gave him a lift home on a snowy evening.

The alleged victim - who said she feared she was going to be raped - told police: 'The thought he could do that without my consent and to think he "likes the chase" made me feel dirty', the court heard.

On the first day of his trial today his famous sons, Gary and Phil, were in the public gallery to support him.

The incident is said to have taken place in Bury, Greater Manchester, in the early hours of March 23, but Neville denies the offence.

The jury of eight women and four men was told that the accused knew his alleged victim.

The incident happened following a night out in which the alleged victim offered the defendant a lift home in her car in the cold, snowy conditions at the time.

Peter Cadwallader, prosecuting, said when she was about to drop him off near his home, he suddenly 'lunged' at her and forced his tongue in her mouth.

She said she told him to stop but he persisted and grabbed her breast before he pushed his hand down her trousers and inside her underwear, the prosecutor said.

When she later reported the matter to the police, married Neville did not deny the incident took place but told detectives it was consensual.

Mr Cadwallader told the jury: 'The Crown 
say it was not consensual and he knew full well it was not consensual 
because she told him so.'

The prosecution said she was effectively pinned to her seat as she told him to stop when he began kissing her.

Mr Cadwallader continued: 'The Crown would say he had far too much to drink.

'The defendant did not stop with kissing her. He pushed his hand up her top and grabbed her breast.

'By that stage she was feeling more and more distraught and frightened by the persistence.

'She did not know what it would end with.'

He then pushed his hand down her trousers as he attempted unsuccessfully to undo the buttons, the court heard.

Forcing her thighs apart he then sexually assaulted her in a 'rough' manner, the court was told.

She continued to tell him to stop and eventually the defendant got out of the car and she drove off, said Mr Cadwallader.

The prosecutor added: 'She was in a distraught condition. She did not know at that stage what to do.'

The alleged victim entered the witness box to give evidence without screens.

The jury was played a video of her police interview.

She told the interviewing female officer: 'I feel cheap. I have never been made to feel like that in my life.

'I felt I was doing him a favour on dropping him off because it was snowing... he abused that kindness really.

'I did not want him to fall in the snow and slip. And he is a big guy so I said 'I will drop you off'. I had no reason not to give him a lift.'

Describing the moments before the alleged sexual assault, she said Neville told her to pull over.

'He said 'Turn the engine off' and I just did it.

'He took his seatbelt off. I didn't take mine off.'

'He forced his head on me,' she said. 'It was a really forceful kiss. His tongue, like, forced down my throat.

'I had never been in a situation like that, especially with someone I knew.'

She said she initially thought she would be blamed for what had happened for not pushing him off.

'I just froze,' she said, 'My whole body froze. I could not speak. I just panicked.

'He forced himself on me totally. His hand up the side of my shirt, inside my bra. He grabbed hold of me but at the same time forcing me down with his face. He is a very, very big man. That was stopping me moving.

'He went down my trousers... he forced my legs apart and he was trying to rip my trousers off.

'I said 'Stop what you are doing'. I didn't say 'No'.

'I said 'You are a married man, are you not happy?' and he said 'I'm very happy'.

'I said 'What are you doing?' and he said 'I like the chase'.'

The trial continues.
