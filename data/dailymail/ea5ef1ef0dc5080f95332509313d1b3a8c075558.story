Sordid new details about the night when Maryville teenager Daisy Coleman claims she was raped by high school senior, Matthew Barnett have been released by police in the Missouri town.

In a taped interview with police, recorded just hours after the alleged assault, Barnett told police that he and the then 14-year-old did have sex in his house, but it was consensual and crucially, Coleman began drinking heavily afterwards.

The newly released material from the police also reveals that Daisy admitted texting Barnett 'once a month' and indicated to the star-football player that she would provide him with sexual favors if he gave her alcohol.

New revelations: Daisy Coleman told police that she traded suggestive text messages with Matthew Barnett before she was allegedly raped by the teen in Maryville in January 2012

The case files from the police include the July 2012 criminal depositions of Daisy and her mother, Melinda Coleman.

Daisy claims that before the allged incident, Barnett, who was 17 at the time, said, 'sometimes me and my friends would see if he would bring us alcohol.'

Barnett tells police that he picked Daisy up from her house on January 8, 2012 and that she was not intoxicated but appeared 'buzzed'.

Police also shared Daisy's text messages the night of the alleged assault, which show they did agree beforehand to meet.

'U wanna come drink wit me and chill,' wrote Barnett according to the files and tapes from ABC News.

'OMFG. Sweeet,' replied Coleman, who later wrote, 'do you want me to bring alchol [sic]?'

While it is not disputed that Daisy drank at least five shots of vodka at Barnett's house on January 8, what is important is when she drank them.

Missouri law states that a 14-year-old girl cannot consent to sex if she is incapacitated.

Barnett has never disputed that he and Daisy had sex, but has insisted it was consensual and she was not drunk at the time.

Another witness, a boy, at the house, said that Daisy drank heavily after her sexual encounter with Barnett.

Daisy has always said that she sneaked out of her house with her friend after drinking and was picked up by Barnett who fed her shots in a tall glass causing her to blackout.

She claims that Barnett then raped her and dropped her off in her own front yard in the freezing cold.

The identities of alleged sex assault victims are generally not published, but Coleman's family decided to go public with her identity and accusations

The case divided the small town and Barnett has never been convicted of rape charges - which were dropped.

Daisy was suspended from the cheerleading team because she admitted to drinking and the family were forced to move, but that didn't stop the slew of online attacks.

'The stuff on Facebook and Twitter was just unbelievable, so horrible ... saying stuff like, 'Why don't you slit your wrists,' Daisy' mother, Melinda Coleman told 20/20 in a January interview.

Then almost exactly two years after the initial incident, Daisy attempted to commit suicide for the third time after ingesting a mix of cough medicine and prescription drugs.

The case was reignited in October 2013, when he Kansas City Star reported on the allegations and Robert Rice's decision to drop charges against Barnett, who was initially charged with felony sex and child endangerment.

The state appointed a special prosecutor to re-investigate the case, which ended in Barnett pleading guilty to the misdemeanor charge on Jan. 9, 2014 - two years almost to the date of the alleged incident.

Barnett and his attorney maintain that the fact that two independent investigations have cleared him proves that he didn't do anything wrong.

Indeed, last month, depositions in the sexual assault case show contradictions in statements between Daisy and her mother.

Bullied: Daisy and her family have reportedly been followed by private investigators and had to leave the Maryville after reporting the alleged rape

In more than 100 pages of testimony, the Colemans described the night in January 2012 when Daisy, who was 14 at the time, claims she was raped.

Jackson County prosecuting attorney Jean Peters Baker served as special prosecutor after Nodaway County Prosecutor Robert Rice asked for someone else to review the evidence amid questions about why he dropped charges against the alleged attacker.

The testimony describes how Daisy and a female friend had been drinking before asking Matt Barnett, then 17, to pick them up after they sneaked out of Daisy's home.

Daisy claimed Barnett took her to his house, plied her with alcohol and raped her when she blacked out.

Mrs Coleman found her daughter shivering on the front porch at about 5am the next day.

According to the depositions released on Friday, Mrs Coleman told Rice that Daisy had been less than truthful on some things in her deposition and attributed that to the girl's embarrassment over the ordeal.

Age difference: Daisy was a 14-year-old freshman at the time of the alleged assault while Matthew Barnett was a 17-year-old senior

For example, Rice at one point had asked Daisy about an incident in which she burned the name of a boy into her skin.

Mrs Coleman said that it was Barnett's name; Daisy said in her deposition that it was another boy's name.

At one point, the mother suggested that the contradictions would likely keep the case out of a courtroom.

'I don't think that you probably can try this case now. I think there's been too many lies,' she said, according to the newly released documents.

The Colemans and their supporters later claimed Rice dropped a felony assault charge against Barnett because of insensitivity, prosecutorial ambivalence and political pressure from the boy's grandfather, a retired state trooper and four-term state legislator.

Claims: Daisy alleged that Barnett took her to his house and gave her alcohol before assaulting her

Mrs Coleman told The Associated Press that she hadn't seen the depositions, which she claimed Rice had denied even existed, and she didn't believe some of what was purported to be in them.

Quite frankly, Robert Rice is a liar and I wouldn't be surprised if he put that in there himself,' Mrs Coleman said.

Daisy's story made headlines nationwide after The Kansas City Star published a 4,000-word article in October detailing the girl's claims against Barnett.

The AP generally doesn't name the victims of sexual assault but it is naming Daisy because she and her mother granted public interviews.

In January, Barnett pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child endangerment after Baker concluded there wasn't enough evidence for a felony conviction.

Barnett has not denied the two had sex, but has insisted that it was consensual.

Robert Sundell, an attorney who initially represented Barnett after he was charged, said on Friday he was glad the documents were released.

'If all of the records and all of the evidence were made public, I think it would be pretty easy for anyone to recognize why the case didn't go forward,' he said.
