Oscar Garcia declared his interest in replacing Neil Lennon at Celtic on Friday night and insisted he would achieve Champions League progress with a dash of Barcelona style.

The former Barca player, whose sterling work within the famed La Masia youth system was followed by a title triumph for Maccabi Tel Aviv and a Premiership near miss with Brighton, has been added to the short-list drawn up in the wake of Lennon’s resignation.

The 41-year-old, known at Celtic for the way his Barcelona Under-19s performed in home-and-away wins over their Scottish counterparts in the 2011 Next Generation Series, told Sportsmail: ‘For me it’s an honour to be linked to a club like Celtic.

Up for the job: Oscar Garcia, who left Brighton after narrowly missing out on promotion, has put his name forward

‘They are one of the best and biggest clubs in Europe, so it’s great to have interest. Nobody from the club has spoken directly to me and you would have to ask them why they might be interested.

‘But I know what I can do, what I can achieve, how I want to play, what philosophy I would bring to them. I grew up with the Barcelona philosophy and I would try to play attractive football.

‘I would be confident of taking them into the Champions League. The big objective of a club like Celtic must be to get into the group stages – and then to find the right way to be better, to improve and to see where Celtic can go.’

As the runners and riders jostle for position in the race to takeover from Lennon, the sporting director of Henrik Larsson’s club Falkenbergs insisted the Parkhead legend was not in the running.

Larsson is currently head coach at the Swedish Allsvanskan club and is the bookmakers’ favourite to succeed Lennon.

But Hakan Nilsson insists Larsson has promised to honour his contract despite admitting he has been told of interest from an unnamed club.

‘Henrik told me there has been a club that wanted to talk to him,’ Nilsson told Sportsmail.

Club legend: Former striker Henrik Larsson is favourite for the job, but his current club say he is not available

‘He is honest, we talk all the time and after that he said to me he is staying at Falkenbergs.

‘He has a contract for one year.  If the question of moving to Celtic is coming up then we have to look at it. We have to deal with it.

‘But it hasn’t come up. So for me it is nothing to worry about.

‘I would expect Celtic to do things professionally, of course. I believe Celtic is a very professional club and I have no concerns on that score. But we have a game tomorrow and that is all we are concerned about at the moment. I am not worried.’

Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell said: ‘There is nothing yet. It’s very, very early.

‘It’s very early to make any further comment, I’m sure you will understand.

‘We will take as much time as it needs to get the right candidate and we have got a wee bit of time so hopefully we will get it right.’

Lennon left yesterday for a trip to the Champions League final in Lisbon and was asked if Larsson was the man to succeed him.

‘You would need to ask Henrik that,’ Lennoin said. ‘If he does, then I am sure he will be a huge success – why not?

‘He had a great career as a player and is a very intelligent guy. He knows the game very, very well.’

Potential targets: Celtic are interested in Malky Mackay (left) but Roy Keane (right) has ruled himself out

Sportsmail has learned Celtic are also interested in Malky Mackay and the former Cardiff City manager will discuss the job with his ex-club if invited for talks.

Owen Coyle, Jackie McNamara and Steve Clarke have also been heavily quoted, but Roy Keane has distanced himself from the job.

The Republic of Ireland assistant manager is also an ITV pundit and quizzed on the matter yesterday said: ‘I’ve got a job - I’ve got two jobs - I can’t have another one.

‘Celtic are a brilliant club, an absolutely fantastic football club, one of the best in the world. But I have got a job.’

He added with a smile: ‘I’m not taking a pay cut for anybody.’

In with a shout: Both Owen Coyle (left) and Steve Clarke (right) have both been backed for the job

Currently preparing for a friendly with Turkey, Keane will fly to Lisbon on ITV duty for tonight’s Champions League final, but remains friendly with Dermot Desmond.

‘There’s always speculation when you are out of work or whatever. People might see this role as part-time or whatever, but it keeps me busy, I enjoy it.

‘I’m happy with what I’m doing and if somebody calls me, I will speak to Martin and the FAI and we will have a look at it.

‘But it’s all speculation, and obviously that speculation comes from yourselves. I don’t think you have heard it from any club sources.’
