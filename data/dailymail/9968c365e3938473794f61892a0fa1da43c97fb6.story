Such is the clamor for tickets for Coventry City's return to the Ricoh Arena that one supporter was prepared to camp outside the box office on Wednesday night.

The Sky Blues will return to the city when they face Gillingham this weekend after more than a year playing their games in Northampton.

But the club's loyal follower - known simply as 'Andy' - was saved from a night in the cold when a fellow City fan arrived at the ground to offer his spare ticket after hearing the story on Twitter.

Heading home: Coventry are to return to the Ricoh Arena after playing in Northampton for more than a year

Remaining tickets have been limited to two per person to deal with the demand from excited supporters. 

Steve Waggott, chief executive of Coventry City Football Club, said: 'You can feel the positivity around the city about our return to the Ricoh and long may that continue.

'Everyone is looking forward to Friday night and what should be a great occasion for the club and the city.'

The League One side have ended their dispute with the stadium's owners, Arena Coventry Limited (ACL), and have reached an agreement to head back to the stadium they played in between 2005 and 2013.

The two-year deal, with an option for an extra two years, should see the Sky Blues play at the Ricoh in their next home fixture, which is against Gillingham on 6 September.

The deal was struck after Coventry owners Sisu paid ACL £471,192 via the Football League last week, with the money going towards compensation and unpaid rent.

ACL had previously said it would not discuss a return until it received money owed by the club after they went into administration last year.

Sisu and ACL first came into conflict in April 2012 when Coventry started to withhold what they felt was unreasonable rent from the stadium operators.

The Sky Blues then agreed a three-year groundshare deal with Northampton - 35 miles away - with an option of a further two years, and the Cobblers will be due compensation after the early end of the deal.

 'We are delighted to get this deal done and I am sure every supporter of Coventry City will be thrilled with this news.

'We are under no illusion what a difficult 12 months it has been for the supporters and that was uppermost in our thinking as we worked to get this deal done.

'There has had to be compromise on both sides and the commercial details of the deal will remain confidential.

'Now it is all about looking forward to a really exciting season back in the community and with a real chance of success. I am sure every supporter will want to give Steven Pressley, his staff and players their full backing for the season at the Ricoh.

'Logistically, it's going to mean a huge amount of work between now and the first game back and we would ask supporters to bear with us as all of our efforts up to now have been in getting this deal over the line to get us back to Coventry as soon as possible.

'We will announce details around tickets, Season Tickets and other information as soon as we can next week but we hope to be back at the Ricoh for the clash with Gillingham. We will keep supporters fully informed of progress to that aim.

'Can I also take this opportunity of thanking Chris Robinson, Chair of ACL, for the professional manner he has conducted our lengthy discussions to reach this agreement.'
