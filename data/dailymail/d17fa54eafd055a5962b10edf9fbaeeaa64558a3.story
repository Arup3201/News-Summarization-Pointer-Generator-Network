Paul Nixon kept wicket in 882 games during a 22-year career with Kent, Leicestershire and England.

Before Jos Buttler’s Test debut in Southampton today, he runs the rule over the keeper’s strengths and weaknesses.

‘He’s a young boy still and we’ve got to accept he is nowhere near the finished article,’ says Nixon. ‘We’ve thrown him in at the deep end, he’s going to make mistakes but we cannot crucify him.’

Debutant: He is set to make his Test bow for England against India on Sunday

CATCHING

The area everyone will notice and an area he definitely needs to work on. He needs to relax, he’s looking a little tense at the moment, which is understandable as there’s a lot of pressure on him because he’s not served his apprenticeship.

Verdict: The biggest concern. Patience is a must.

Catching practice: Jos Buttler in an England nets session on Saturday

MOVEMENT Needs to get his feet moving a little bit earlier and — it sounds crazy — keep his head just on the inside of his ‘outside’ leg. So if there’s a right-handed batsman, he’s got to get his head going towards the outside edge, which will be towards his big toe on his right leg.

His chin needs to be there to follow the ball, not straight down central because otherwise he is losing time in the catching area.

Verdict: A fair bit of work to do.

Pedigree: He is already established in limited overs cricket for England

STANCEFor me he’s fractionally too upright. He needs a flatter back with his chin closer to his knees so his head’s out in front to keep his weight on the balls of his feet.

That will help him access the ball that’s lower — catches at shin and ankle height. If there’s an area Matt Prior struggled with it was those lower catches.

Verdict: Work to be done but it’s something Jos can fix very easily.

Backup: In training with captain Alastair Cook (centre) and Chris Jordan (right)

GLOVEWORK

He’s got to keep making sure his fingers are pointing down as much as he can rather than pointing forward at the ball as he does now. So much is linked in with the stance, as if you’re in the right position it’s easier to take catches and make stumpings.

He needs to try to catch the ball with knees slightly bent rather than having his legs straight and his back upright so he can get forward and take the ball early with long arms out in front.

Verdict: One of his stronger areas. Not a concern.

Batsman: According to a school friend, he was a reluctant wicketkeeper growing up

ON-FIELD LEADERSHIPI think the more confident he gets with his keeping, the more instinctive he’ll be with it and then we’ll see more of the real character of Jos Buttler the keeper.Verdict: A work in progress.

Safe hands: But he has been working hard with Somerset to prepare for his chance when it comes

BATTING

We’d rather see Jos playing more of his natural game than anything else.

He’ll have a challenge similar to Eoin Morgan’s — does he play in ultrapositive one-day mode or rein it in. Jos will play the situation but in terms of ability he’s more like Kevin Pieteresen and we’d rathersee him play his natural game just as KP did.
