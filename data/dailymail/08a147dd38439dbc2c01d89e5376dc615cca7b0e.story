Guilty: Elementary school teacher Paul Chapel molested 13 students over a five-year period. He faces 25 years to life in prison

An elementary school teacher who molested 13 students over a five-year period faces 25 years to life in prison.

Paul Chapel III pleaded no contest to the charges yesterday just as his preliminary hearing was about to begin in San Fernando Superior Court in Los Angeles.

The 51-year-old admitted 13 counts of lewd acts upon a child.

Some of his victims were in court preparing to testify against their former teacher.

Deputy
District Attorney Elena Abramson said Chapel will be sentenced to 25 
years in state prison when he returns to court on September 20.

The
Telfair Elementary School teacher was initially charged last year with 
molesting four children. Prosecutors added nine more children to the 
case in May.

The molestations occurred between September 2006 and April 2011 and involved children between the ages of eight and nine.

Although
Chapel was charged with molesting four children last year, Los Angeles 
Unified school officials waited until February to tell parents of his 
third-grade students about his arrest.

Even
then, they only did so because two teachers at nearby Miramonte 
Elementary School were arrested on suspicion of molestation and 
reporters investigated if any other teachers in the area had been 
removed on similar grounds.

Chapel was fired from his job in March.

According to court documents seen by the Daily News Los Angeles, the district ignored repeated complaints about Chapel's conduct around children.

Not
only that, but he had previously left a private school after allegedly 
making inappropriate comments during a sex education class.

And
he was tried but not convicted of another alleged molestation in 1997 
in which he was accused of abusing an eight-year-old neighbour and 
friend of his son who was sleeping at his house.

That case went to trial but Chapel wasn't convicted due to a lack of physical evidence - it was his word against the child's.

But
Los Angeles Unified said it has no record of this incident, and claims 
that because he was not convicted the district does not automatically 
investigate matters that take place off school grounds.

The
day after he was arrested in 1997, Chapel was suspended without pay 
from Andasol Avenue Elementary in Northridge, where he had worked for 
ten years.

The charges were dismissed in August 1998 and Chapel was reemployed, with back pay, at Telfair Elementary.

He will be sentenced next month.
