David De Gea has been a rock in Manchester United's shaky defence during a difficult first five months for Louis van Gaal's new-look side, says former Old Trafford legend Peter Schmeichel.

De Gea, who signed from Altetico Madrid for £18.9million in 2011, had a difficult start to life with United with many criticising the Spaniard for some shaky early displays between the posts.

De Gea, however, has excelled for United in recent seasons and has been consistently excellent behind a questionable defence hit by injuries to key players such as Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Luke Shaw and without the experienced trio of Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra who all moved on during the summer.

And Schmeichel, who played eight seasons for United, believes De Gea has proven himself to be Van Gaal's most reliable player during the current campaign.

'He's doing really well,' Schmeichel told goal.com. I think he's the only player in the squad who performs consistently every time. Last season he was the only player who consistently brought any kind of quality to Manchester United.

'Last season was good for him. He won the championship in the year before but there was still this doubt about him and I think he washed that away with his performances.'

After a disastrous start to the season, including a 5-3 humiliation at Leicester City in September, Van Gaal's has steadied the ship in recent weeks with United winning their last five Premier League games on the trot.

Recent wins over Crystal Palace, Arsenal, Hull, Stoke City and Southampton have propelled United up to third in the table.

'That's how you win championships. That's how you qualify for the Champions League,' the Dane added.

'Last season, as soon as they came under pressure and went behind, they would lose the game which is very unlike Manchester United.

'To get results and play the way they played against Southampton and win that game, it was hugely important.

'At no point in that game were they impressive but that was the kind of game they would lose last season so that's a very big positive.'

United will hoping De Gea's superb form continues as they target a sixth win in a row when they host arch-rivals Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.
