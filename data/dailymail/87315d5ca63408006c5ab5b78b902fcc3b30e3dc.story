A woman who called an Asian passenger a 'gook'  and mocked her language and facial features has been arrested after her racist outburst was filmed on a Sydney train.

Sue Wilkins, 55, was being questioned over the racial tirade at a Central Coast police station on Thursday night.

The video - filmed by another passenger who was also a target of Wilkins' abuse - shows her hurling offensive remarks at the Asian woman, mocking her accent and pulling her eyes back.

The video footage, filmed on a Sydney train, showed a woman hurling racist abuse at an Asian woman by mocking her accent and pulling her eyes back

The racist woman then turned her attention to the man filming the scene, who was next to the Asian woman, saying he 'can't even get a regular girlfriend, it's so sad, he's got to get a gook'

Ms Wilkins apologised to the victim after the video went public and acknowledged there were no excuse for such offensive behaviour.

'It's awful and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy, regardless of any race,' she said in an exclusive interview with Ninemsn.

'It's not nice what I did to that lady.'

Wilkins, who had recently returned from Holland to live with family in the Central Coast in Sydney's north, said she was having a 'rotten day'.

'I've been chasing work for quite some time now. It's awful what I said to that woman, I do agree,' she said.

'It wasn't nice to say that to her because it's not nice when people say that to me ... call me white trash and fatso. I know how it hurts and I shouldn't be saying it to other people.'

Wilkins said she has been the victim of a $100,000 scam by a mystery Dutchman, whom she met on dating website RSVP.

After she caused a scene inside the carriage, police first spoke to Ms Wilkins on Wednesday when she alighted at Strathfield in Sydney's west.

They decided to let her 'go about her journey', NSW Police Transport Command Assistant Commissioner Max Mitchell told reporters.

Mr Mitchell didn't know why she was allowed to walk free but stressed she would be charged for her 'abhorrent and unacceptable behaviour'.

A charge of offensive behaviour carries a $500 fine but any penalty could be greater because the incident was racially motivated.

Sydney Trains chief executive Howard Collins - the former boss of London Underground - added that he had not seen anything like it in 37 years as a transport executive.

The incident occured at about 4pm on Wednesday on a northbound train heading from Sydney's Central station to the NSW central coast.

The train was traveling from Newcastle and Central Coast Line as some commuters warned the woman that she would be charged with assault when they arrived at Strathfield station, Sydney's inner west

In the footage, Wilkins also targets the man filming the scene, who was next to the Asian woman, saying he 'can't even get a regular girlfriend, it's so sad, he's got to get a gook'.

'He's too lazy to jerk off, he can only get a gook,' the rant continued.

'Gook' is a derogatory term for people of Asian descent which started in the Vietnam War.

The man filming the scene described the woman as 'f*cking scum' but she seemed unfazed and called him a 'bogan'.

'Oh look at it (alluding to the Asian woman), isn't it sad that he can't get a regular girlfriend, he's got to get an Asian? And she probably thinks he's rich,' Ms Wilkins said.

'What's wrong with Hong Kong? Why did you come to this country? This is our country.'

However the man had no association with the Asian passenger next to him, saying in the footage that he is married to another woman.

'(The Asian woman) is not even the cameraman's wife, she was just a random passenger sitting next to him,' a witness said.

'My mate who took the vid saw her getting questioned by the cops, but didn't stick around cause (sic) he wanted to get home to his real wife.'

Kareem Abdulm, who uploaded the original video on YouTube, said the woman first became aggressive toward some children who refused to vacate their seats when she had demanded.

'This video begins just after she had started screaming expletives into the face of the upset kids and the mother of the children got up to stand in between the lady and her kids,' he wrote.

'The lady then assaulted the mother and a young dude who gave up his seat for her.'

The man filmed the woman complaining to police on the phone about the children who would not offer her their seats.

Ms Wilkins says she argued with the children's mother, who told her they did not have to comply to her request.

'I thought it was just a disgrace,' Ms Wilkins said.

'What sort of an example is that setting for your children? It's just appalling.'

This isn't the first incident of its kind in Australia, where two young women kicked and spat on a vision-impaired elderly man on a Gold Coast bus, Brisbane's south, in September.

A Melbourne man was also jailed for 21 days in March after racially abusing a French tourist on a bus in 2012.

Another racist attack on public transport involved an ABC newsreader Jeremy Fernandez, where he was subject to a 15-minute rant on a Sydney bus in April last year, was told go back to his country and called a 'black c***'.

Fernandez declined to comment on this week's abuse when contacted by Daily Mail Australia.

Vic Alhadeff, Chairman of NSW Community Relations Commission, described the recent abuse as a 'despicable act'.

'(It) violates everything that we stand for as a proudly multicultural state which embraces diversity and celebrates difference, he said.

'Such outbursts of racism demean us as a society, and we encourage all who witness such offensive behaviour in future to condemn it immediately and unreservedly.'

NSW Minister for Transport Gladys Berejiklian said she is 'disgusted by any kind of racism or threatening behaviour towards customers using public transport'.

A Sydney Trains and NSW TrainLink spokeswoman said they condemn any form of abuse on their services.

'The safety of our customer is our priority and we will continue to work with the Police Transport Command to respond to these incidents,' she said.

Witnesses should contact police on Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
