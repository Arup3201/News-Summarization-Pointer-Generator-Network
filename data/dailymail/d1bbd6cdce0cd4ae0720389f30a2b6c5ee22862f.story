The clocks will go back in the early hours of tomorrow morning, officially marking the end of British summertime

It's that time of year again when the cold, winter nights draw in and we say goodbye to British summertime.

The UK will return to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) when the clocks turn back an hour at 2am tomorrow morning - giving us an extra hour in bed. 

It means tomorrow will be a 25-hour day with the sun rising and setting an hour earlier than today, meaning the mornings will be lighter.

During British Summer Time (BST) the time advances an hour to allow for extra daylight in the evenings.

The idea was first proposed by George Vernon Hudson, an English-born insect specialist and astronomer, in 1895.

As a shift worker he valued the daylight after-hours for collecting insects and proposed a two-hour daylight saving shift, presenting it in a paper to the Wellington Philosophical society.

But his ideas were never carried through and it was builder William Willett who put forward another proposal and in 1907 published a pamphlet called The Waste of Daylight.

It outlined how during the summer, the mornings were being 'wasted' by people who were still asleep for most of it and how moving the clocks would encourage people out of bed.

The notion was picked up by MPs who introduced it as a bill in the House of Commons, but it did not become a law - and Willett fought for the scheme until he died in 1915. 

A year after his death Germany introduced the system as a way to conserve coal during war time -and Britain quickly followed suit in May 1916.

However the decision was not without controversy - farmers and those working in the entertainment industry opposed it.

While it caused problems for those with clocks which did not have the facility to go backwards without breaking the  mechanism, instead owners had to set their watches 11 hours forward.

Despite that, the system has remained in place ever since, apart from an experimental three years between 1968 and 1971 and during the Second World War.

Now it has been claimed that the clocks going back over winter adds £24 to the typical household's yearly energy bill as people switch their lights on sooner.

Throughout the winter months it increases the nation's winter electricity bills to £630million, a study by B&Q claims.

The calculation is based on the assumption that the average household uses 30 light bulbs with a mixture of traditional incandescent bulbs, energy-efficient fluorescent bulbs, halogen lights and a few LED lights. 

The retailer says that switching entirely to LED light's would see winter lighting bills drop to just £2.47.

Matt Sexton, from B&Q, told the Daily Telegraph: 'We can't change the fact that the clocks go back, we can't change the fact that we'll be leaving our lights on for longer, but we can change a light bulb.

'Switching to LED light bulbs is an easy way of cutting down our energy bills with minimal effort.'

Meanwhile Scotland could have its own time zone under plans to move the UK to Central European Time.

Builder William Willett put forward the idea of moving the clocks in 1907 after becoming frustrated that people were sleeping through the daylight in the mornings 

The campaign to shift the UK forward an hour, aligning the nation with most of Europe, is supported by a wide range of MPs, who claim the change would save lives on the road thanks to extra sunlight.

Scotland has been opposed to the change in the past, but campaigners say Westminster could devolve powers allowing Scots to set their own time.

The clocks are due to go forward again on the last Sunday in March 2015.
