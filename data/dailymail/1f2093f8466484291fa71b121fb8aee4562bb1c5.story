Horrifying footage has emerged showing a Malaysian mother repeatedly hitting, kicking and her defenceless ten-month-old daughter.

The distressing clip which is just over four minutes in duration has caused fury on the internet, with many users who watched the video labelling the mother as 'sadistic' and 'not fit to be near children.'

A friend of the mother, who was 18 at the time of the incident, had become concerned after witnessing her beating the child previously, so filmed the abuse and took the video evidence to the police.

First blow: The mother, seen raising her hand before hitting the child, sits on a bed, while the baby girl is on the corner of the mattress, crying hysterically as she lies face down

Disturbing viewing: The woman hits the child over the head repeatedly with a cushion and at one point throws her mobile phone at the screaming baby

Thought to be filmed on a 
mobile phone, the mother, who is unmarried, is seen sitting on a bed, while the baby is 
on the corner of the mattress, crying hysterically as she lies face down. 

The woman hits the child over the head repeatedly with a cushion and at one point throws her mobile phone at the screaming baby.

As the wailing intensifies the woman pinches her arms and thighs and kicks her - the helpless baby just lays on the mattress, unable to fend off the blows.

When the distraught baby lifts her head up, she flops forward again, dazed from being repeatedly hit on the head.

Abusive: At one point the mother grabs the baby's head and slams it back down onto the mattress

Looking for help: In a heartbreaking move, the baby still crawls over to her mother and tries to rest on her knee for comfort,  but she is promptly shoved so hard that she falls on to her back

At one point the mother roughly grabs the baby's head, pinches her face and slams her back down onto the mattress as a young child, nibbling food, wanders into shot and watches the abuse.

In a heartbreaking move, the baby still crawls over to her mother and tries to rest on her knee for comfort, but she is promptly shoved so hard that she falls on to her back screaming out.

It is unclear what the woman is saying, but the voice of another woman, assumed to be the person recording the incident, can also be be heard in the video.

According to Arjunaidi Mohamed, the chief of police in Petaling Jaya, the mother was 18-years-old when she inflicted the beating on her 10-month-old child in May last year, reported CNN.

He refused to disclose the mother's name, but said she was convicted of child abuse and sentenced to 18 months in prison.

The baby was put into the care of a foster family after her mother's arrest and is now doing 'very well,' said Fatimah Zuraidah Salleh, deputy director of the children division of the Social Welfare Department to CNN.

After watching the distributing video, many users felt compelled to voice their disgust in the comment section.

One user wrote 'I literally cried after watching this video.. Cant even imagine beating up any kid like she did.'

'How can those other people in the 
room just stand by and watch this happen? That poor little baby just 
wants to be picked up and all she can do it continually beat it,' wrote 
another user.

The court will decide whether the mother, who is due to be released in late November, will be allowed to regain custody of the child.
