Floyd Mayweather Jnr has praised fellow welterweight world champion Kell Brook for the way he ended the reign of Shawn Porter in Los Angeles earlier this month.

Sheffield's Brook won the IBF title after recovering from a slow start to dominate Porter down the home stretch and win a majority decision.

And Mayweather did not rule out a unification clash with the Brit in the future as he prepares to defend his own titles against Marcos Maidana.

'You know, the fight was very, very hard to watch,' he told Fight Hype. 'The guy Kell Brook came to my boxing gym I think five days before the fight and watched me spar a little bit. [He was a] cool guy and a true gentleman. He earned it the hard way.

'After that many fights, whether it's against tomato cans or against top opposition, you're going to have some type of experience to be able to go 12 rounds, and you have to be able to fight just a little bit if you beat everybody that they put in front of you. 

'So congratulations to him and I wish him nothing but the best.'

Mayweather is currently preparing for his rematch with Maidana next month but admitted his future opponents are yet to be decided.

'Well, I already know who I'm fighting September 13,' he added. 'As of right now, I don't know who I'm fighting in May and I don't know who I'm fighting next September, but you know I gotta take just one fight at a time and my focus is Maidana.'

Brook's first defence of his title will be on December 6 in Sheffield ahead of a possible date with bitter rival Amir Khan next year.
