Images of 12 of London's most wanted individuals have been released by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) as it intensifies its crackdown on the capital's most evasive suspects this Christmas.

The photos, which show six people being sought for burglary and six people sought for violence with injury offences such as grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm, have been uploaded to the Crimestoppers website in a public appeal for help.

The dozen include Alan Goodin, 64, wanted by Ealing, who has 27 aliases and is accused of fleeing a series of bed and breakfast guesthouses without paying his bills; and another man, Jay Wheeler, 26, who allegedly attacked a neighbour with a metal bar after an argument over loud music and is wanted by Greenwich Police.

Dedicated fugitive teams made up of officers from the Met's Territorial Support Group (TSG) as well as officers from boroughs, are in action across all parts of the capital tracking down wanted suspects in support of ongoing Operations Bumblebee and Equinox.

The London-wide hunt for wanted offenders is part of a range of tactics being used to crack down on burglary and violence, as part of the Met's ongoing commitment to drive down these type of crimes, arrest offenders and support victims.

The TSG teams - which specialise in intelligence-led operations - have successfully arrested hundreds of hard-to-find wanted offenders including 30 burglars since November and dozens of individuals who have committed violent offences such as grievous bodily harm, actual bodily harm and attempted murder. 

They have also apprehended individuals wanted for domestic violence, child sexual exploitation offences and rape.

Latest figures show that between October 17 and December 8, 368 wanted offenders were arrested for burglary and a total of 657 wanted offenders were arrested for violence with injury offences (grievous bodily harm, actual bodily harm, manslaughter, attempted murder and murder) across the Met.

Commander Simon Letchford, of Territorial Policing at the MPS, said: 'We are stepping up our activity to locate and arrest outstanding wanted suspects as part of our ongoing response to tackling burglary and violence in the capital.

'We will not give up in the search to find people who flout the law and cause people misery and we will use every means available to catch them.

'The use of fugitive teams and other daily operations will continue to ensure those wanted are caught, so they can face justice.'

 

Operation Bumblebee launched on October 20 to target the 25 per cent rise in residential burglary offences traditionally seen during autumn and winter.

A range of pro-active measures, including traditional tactics and the use of science and technology are being put to use, including high visibility patrols in burglary hot spots, driven by the use of predictive crime mapping.

The MPS is making good use of predictive crime mapping, which takes historic crime data and models the likely locations of future criminal acts. 

This allows them to direct officers and other resources to key areas. 

The police now produce automated crime maps for every ward in London covering 14 different crime types.

Officers are using super cocooning to support victims and prevent offences in the surrounding neighbourhood, as following a burglary it is not uncommon that burglars will target a number of houses in the same street.

Super cocooning works by encouraging residents to be extra vigilant and security conscious. 

Safer Neighbourhood Teams pay a home visit to victims and their neighbours as soon as possible after an offence is reported to give crime prevention advice and gather local intelligence, while patrols are stepped up in the area.

The police are constantly introducing new initiatives to help the public protect their property such as the free traceable liquid marking systems that mark property with a unique code identifiable to any police officer or second-hand goods buyer.

Treatment of 5,000 London homes across ten hot spots saw 767 fewer burglaries and an average drop in crime of 54 per cent in the last ten months of 2013.

Under Operation Neptune, the MPS maps second-hand markets, negotiates a voluntary Code of Conduct for premises to record sellers' personal details, checks property with the National Mobile Phone Crime Unit and informs local police when stolen property comes into their possession. 

There are regular visits and audit checks by local officers.

Latest figures (rolling 12 months figures up to December 15, 2014) show burglary offences have fallen by 12.8 per cent across the Met compared to the previous rolling 12 months (11,247 fewer offences) with the biggest reduction seen in residential burglary at 13.3 per cent (7,563 fewer offences).

In mid-October, the Met launched Operation Equinox to reduce the number of violence-related offences across London. 

It has seen boroughs across the capital join forces in a coordinated crackdown to target activity against a number of licensed venues, geographic areas and fast food outlets where violent offending disproportionately occurs.

MPS latest figures show there were 67,855 violence with injury (this category mainly comprises grievous bodily harm, actual bodily harm and assault with injury) offences in London (rolling 12 months up to December 15 compared to same period last year). 

This shows a 19.8 per cent rise from 56,651 the same period last year.

Research carried out on the figures indicates that the rise is likely to be attributable to improved recording practices rather than a rise in violence per se. 

A high proportion of these crimes typically occurs between the times of 6pm and 6am, and is often focused around licensed venues such as pubs, nightclubs and fast food outlets.

In November and December, there is also traditionally a spike in such crimes as robbery, burglary and anti-social behaviour, the latter often fuelled by alcohol, which can be linked to violence.

Operation Equinox is deploying resources across a wide range of activities - from problem-solving and crime prevention initiatives within wards/boroughs to an intensified focus on forensic retrieval and partnership work with licensed venue operators. 

It includes licensing inspections, enforcement of no-drinking zones and rigorous spot checks carried out in high-profile venues in collaboration with local authority licensing officers.
