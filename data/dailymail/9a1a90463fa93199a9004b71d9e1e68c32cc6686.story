This is the heartwarming moment a chivalrous frog helped to shield its partner from the rain by using a leaf as an umbrella.

The kind gesture between the animals was caught on camera by amateur photographer Kutub Uddin, 27, and was taken in his back garden in Bognor Regis, West Sussex.

The red-eyed tree frogs have been Mr Uddin's pets for four months and he often lets them out to roam around his garden.

Mr Uddin was cleaning out their tank one evening and he watched as they climbed up a plant.

He said: 'When it started to rain I looked to bring the frogs back in and I caught them in these very human poses, holding onto the leaf.

'I just couldn't resist getting my camera and taking a few quick snaps of them before I brought them inside.

'It was really funny to see them acting so human by holding onto the leaf- it looked as if the frogs were using the leaf as an umbrella.

'I thought they liked water so it was funny to see them acting in this way.'

Gentlemanly: Mr Uddin was surprised to see the frogs pulling human-like poses to shield from the rain
