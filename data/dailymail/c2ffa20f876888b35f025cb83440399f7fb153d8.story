In one sense, Gabriel Muniz is just like most other boys his age - desperate to go outside and play football.

But, unlike his teammates, the 11-year-old from Campos dos Goytacazes, Brazil, does not have any feet.

He was born with a limb deficiency called apodia, which meant his feet did not develop. However, Gabriel was determined to walk.

His mother Sandra said: 'He started to walk before he could talk at 10 months. It was incredible.'

Soon
 he was kicking a ball around, joining the local football team at his 
school and even winning medals. Gabriel wears prosthetic limbs most 
days, but when it comes to a match, his boots are off.

After
 impressing family and friends with his ball skills, Gabriel also 
caught the eye of FC Barcelona - and was invited by the Spanish giants 
to a training camp to play against abled-bodied footballers.

That came following a trial at the football club's training academy in Saquarema, Rio de Janeiro.

Last
 year, his best friend Lucas Santos spoke about his abilities to The 
Sun: 'He is skilful, he goes after it [the ball], he is fearless and he 
knows how to organise plays. He also makes good passes.'

'The only thing I can't do is fly'

Gabriel Muniz

In a previous interview, his mother said: 'He started walking before he was one. We would go after him, expecting him to keep falling, but he never fell.'

Gabriel's gym teacher Jose Lopes added: 'He is challenging the social norms. When he arrived there [at the Barcelona academy], no-one believed in him.

'But he proved to everyone there he can go head to head with any other boy. So much so that he was invited to go to Spain to showcase his talent.'

Gabriel is now determined to pursue his dream of becoming a professional player. He said: ‘The only thing I can't do is fly.’
