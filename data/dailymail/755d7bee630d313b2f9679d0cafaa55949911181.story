While some schools are increasingly draconian in their approach to playground supervision, this one has removed supervision altogether.

Every day, during recess and lunchtime, school principal Bruce McLachlan lets his students at Swanson school in Auckland do as they please.

This entails riding scooters down stairs, climbing upside down on trees and building their own three story huts.

Students playing on a makeshift hut: The children do as they please during recess and lunchtime

Swanson principal Bruce McLachlan says 'We were asked to take part in the study three years ago with seven other schools, and we haven't looked back'

It's part of a University study on alternative methods to combat obesity and bullying in the school yard, and Mr McLachlan is adamant that it's combating both.

'We were asked to take part in the study three years ago with seven other schools, and we haven't looked back,' Mr McLachlan says. 

'We've seen a marked reduction in schoolyard injuries and instances of bullying. We're seeing less kids with grazed knees and less kids going to the time out room. And with this in mind, we've gone from six teachers on the schoolyard to one or two.' 

'It's very simple really: rather than telling kids what we can and can't do, we turn a blind eye. We remove adults from the equation.'

Swanson students ride scooters and skateboards and play on makeshift huts in the schoolyard. And yet they are have less injuries than before he introduced the system. 

'The kids are  learning to manage their risks. The child riding his bike around the playground is actively making sure he doesn't run into anyone,' he says.

'The kids using the mudslide are bringing a change of clothes to school, because they know they are going to need that when lunchtime is over.'

Mr McLachlan says: 'We have an underlying assumption that kid left unsupervised will hurt themselves, but I believe that's underestimating what kids are capable of'

Mr McLachlan  says the system of letting his students do as they please in the playground is resulting in greater focus in the classroom

'We have an underlying assumption that kid left unsupervised will hurt themselves, but I believe that's underestimating what kids are capable of.'

Mr McLachlan says the approach is more effective in the long-term. 

'It's better for them to learn at that age than behind the wheel at 18, when there are suddenly no adults around.'

He also claims says the system is helping in the classroom.

'We're seeing kids returning to class with more focus, which is fantastic. In the end of the day, the kids are a lot happier, and that makes for a much better teaching environment.'

'What we're seeing these days in bubble wrap parenting, and it means kids aren't learning as much as they could be. Learning is much for effective when the kids are involved.'

The results of the study, which is a joint venture from the University of Otaggo and the Aucklund University of Technology will be released later this year. 

Bruce McLachlan and the Swanson School will feature on SBS Dateline tonight at 9:30pm
