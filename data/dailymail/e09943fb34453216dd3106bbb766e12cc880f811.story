Sarah Palin has taken aim at 'Hollywood leftists' who have criticized American Sniper, the new Clint Eastwood-directed movie

Sarah Palin has taken aim at ‘Hollywood leftists’ who have criticized American Sniper, the new Clint Eastwood-directed movie about the life of deceased Navy SEAL Chris Kyle.

The movie, which stars Bradley Cooper as Kyle, has triggered a heated  debate about patriotism, with documentary filmmaker Michael Moore and Seth Rogan both taking heat  for criticizing it.

Palin took to Facebook on Monday night to accuse critics of the movie - which raked in a massive $107 million on its debut weekend at the North American box office - of ‘spitting on the graves’ of military heroes.

‘God bless our troops, especially our snipers,’ she wrote.

‘Hollywood leftists: while caressing shiny plastic trophies you exchange among one another while spitting on the graves of freedom fighters who allow you to do what you do, just realize the rest of America knows you're not fit to shine Chris Kyle's combat boots.

Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore caused uproar when he tweeted that he was raised to believe snipers were 'cowards' because his uncle was killed by a Japanese sniper shot during World War II.

Taking to Twitter in rage, the Fahrenheit 9/11 director seethed: 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse.'

Moore later backtracked his comments on Facebook, writing that he thought the film was well made but could have done a better job at contextualizing the Iraq War.

Both Michael Moore, left, and Seth Rogen, have taken heat after posting tweets critical of American Sniper, the Clint Eastwood-directed movie based on the life of deceased Navy SEAL Chris Kyle

Rogen caused a stir after he likened the movie to a Nazi propaganda film.

'American Sniper kind of reminds me of the movie that's showing in the third act of Inglorious Basterds,' he tweeted on Sunday.

Quentin Tarantino's Inglorius Basterds culminates with an assassination attempt on Adolph Hitler at the premiere of a fictional propaganda film called Stolz der Nation which translates to Nation's Pride.

One of the characters of the film is a haughty German soldier who plays himself in Nation's Pride, a movie about how he killed 200 Allied soldiers from a clock tower in one battle.

The comedian later attempted to backtrack his comments, tweeting that there is a big difference between a ‘comparison’ and ‘kinda reminded me.’ 

Palin wasn’t the only Republican unhappy about Rogen and Moore’s criticisms.

American Sniper has racked up six Oscar nominations, including best picture and best actor for star Bradley Cooper

Arizona Congressman Paul Gosar also took to Facebook and published a reaction to Moore’s comments from Sean Johnson, a former Marine who works in his office as a veterans liaison.

'I personally know what our snipers do. I have worked with these guys. Calling them cowards wouldn't faze them one bit but it would amuse them, coming from a soft, Hollywood leftist like Michael Moore. 

'If anyone knows cowards it might be him … pray for Michael Moore to one day understand that his liberty to attack snipers like Chris Kyle is only possible because of these brave patriots,' wrote Johnson. 

Kyle, who served four tours in Iraq, is credited with being the military's most lethal sniper saving hundreds of American lives with at least 160 kills. 

The 38-year-old was killed in 2013 at a shooting range in Texas, allegedly at the hands of a fellow soldier with PTSD that he was trying to help.

Palin took to Facebook on Monday night to accuse critics of the movie - which raked in a massive $107 million on its debut weekend at the North American box office - of ‘spitting on the graves’ of military heroes

American Sniper, based on Kyle’s memoir, blasted into first place with a massive $107 million on its debut weekend at the North American box office, a record for a January opening, industry figures showed on Tuesday.

The war drama has also racked up six Oscar nominations, including best picture and best actor for star Bradley Cooper.
