A weekend fight involving nearly every member of the Palin family was actually started by the infamous politician and her brood, this according to numerous eyewitnesses.

The Palin pack apparently had a run-in with Connor Cleary, an ex-boyfriend of Willow, 20, at a birthday party on Saturday evening, and that was when all hell broke loose.

According to multiple witnesses at the party, oldest Palin son Track, 25, traded blows with his sister's ex on the front lawn of the party, and when Cleary's father Steve tried to break the boys up, Todd Palin began to choke him.

Todd ended up walking away with a bloody nose.

Then, Sarah, 50, tried to get involved.

A source said  the failed vice-presidential candidate was 'nearly crawling on top of people' to get involved in the fight.

The party, meanwhile, was not for Todd, who did turn 50 on Saturday, but rather for twins Matt and Marc McKenna, who are close friends of the Palin family.

Once the fight finally broke up, Willow and big sister Bristol, 23, who apparently spent the entire evening wearing sunglasses as they strolled around the party, tried to start things up all over again, by going after Conner's mother, Melissa.

'They were on a b-line, coming straight at Melissa,' said partygoer Eric Thompson.

They were stopped by the host of the party however, Korey Klingenmeyer, who politely asked them to leave.

So Bristol started punching him in the face. Repeatedly.

Thompson told political blogger Amanda Coyne Bristol 'stood straight up, brought her arm back and cold-cocked [Klingenmeyer] right in the face.'

She did this six more times before Klingenmeyer was able to push her off him. 

'I was thoroughly amazed at the restraint Korey showed. He’s a total gentlemen,' Thompson said.

Then, Sarah got involved all over again and began to scream profanities at everyone. 

This morning, Thompson told Good Morning America, 'I heard Sarah Palin scream out, "You know who we are, don’t you?"'

Finally, to cap it all off, Track stood out in front of the house with his shirt off and his middle finger raised at those who were  leaving

Shortly after this the fighting stopped, and the Palins got in their car for the evening, a stretch Hummer, and left. 

No sooner had the Palins left then the police showed up to take statements from some of the remaining guests.

Thompson believes it was the Palins who called the police. 

Scene of the crime: The home of Klingenmeyer in Anchorage, Alaska

'It was a really nice, mellow party,' he said.

'Then it turned into the Jerry Springer show.' 

Thompson, an employee at McKenna Bros. Paving, the company owned by birthday boys Marc and Matt, has apparently been fired from his job for speaking to the press.

He has hired legal counsel according to the Alaska Dispatch News. 

Police spokesperson Jennifer Castro said of the events, ‘At the time of the incident, none of the involved parties wanted to press charges and no arrests were made.

She then added, ‘Alcohol was believed to have been a factor in the incident. Some of the Palin family members were in attendance at the party.’ 

Oddly enough, it seems Sarah may be trying to distance herself from this story, despite numerous eyewitness reports, as she implied on her Facebook she did not see her family Saturday. 

'I was traveling yesterday, so I'm posting Todd's 50th birthday greeting a day late, which is fine because the handsome guy barely looks a day over 50,' she wrote on Sunday evening. 

The police are still investigating, and the Palin family is not commenting.
