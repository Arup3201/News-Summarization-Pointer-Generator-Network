Saturday Night Live pushed the envelope this week with a parody of a car commercial that had a young girl joining ISIS, and not the US Army, at the end.

The segment was laid out the same as the recent My Bold Dad spot in which a father tearfully drops off his daughter to join the military in his Toyota Camry. 

The spot that first aired during the 2015 Super Bowl and was seen as a touching look at what it is like to say goodbye for those that have family members in the service.

In this version however, the father, played by Taran Killam, dropped off his daughter, played by Dakota Johnson, and as he tearfully said goodbye she says to him; 'Dad, it's just ISIS.'

Dakota Johnson (above) played a young girl joining ISIS in a skit on Saturday Night Live 

The skit ended with the tagline; 'ISIS, We'll take it from here, Dad'

There was even a vehicle with the ISIS flag in the skit

This is the first time that Johnson, the star of Fifty Shades of Grey, has hosted Saturday Night Live

From there, Johnson jumped on a truck with actors playing members of the Islamic State and with a mock flag, which actually appears to read; 'I would like a cat.'

When the father then says to take care of his girl, one of the men yells; 'Death to America.'

Then, as the commercial ended, a message appeared on screen; 'ISIS, We'll take it from here, Dad.' 

Johnson winked at her father to assure him everything was all right in the parody 

Some on twitter found the parody 'depraved'

Others on twitter found the bit 'hysterical'

This all comes on the same week three men were arrested in the United States with ties to the terrorist organization and three female British teenagers left to join the group. 

The skit was met with outrage by many on Twitter, who took the program to task for being insensitive.

'Can't be serious. Isis skit? Like going to college? When so many people are being kidnapped and killed?Depraved,' wrote Raine LaChance.

'Apparently NBC and SNL thought it was funny to have a skit showing ISIS driving to an airport to pick up an American girl. Tasteless Scum!,' said Jim Ematrudo.

Others however found the skit 'hilarious.'

This also comes the same week that the identity of ISIS member Jihadi John was revealed and the group destroyed a collection of priceless statues and sculptures in Iraq dating back thousands of years in Mosul. 

John is British citizen Mohammed Emwazi, the man who is responsible for the high-profile beheadings of Americans James Foley, Peter Kassig and Steven Sotliff as well as British citizens David Haines and Alan Henning in the name of the terrorist organization.

His identity was previously unknown as he always wears a mask. 

Canada this week also said that they believe four missing teenagers may have traveled to be in ISIS.
