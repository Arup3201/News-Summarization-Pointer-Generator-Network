She's suddenly been thrust into the limelight after accusing a talent show contestant of stealing someone else's style - but according to users on Twitter, Natalia Kills's own look is far from original.

The Bradford-born singer, 28, was fired from the judging panel of New Zealand's X Factor, along with her husband Willy Moon, after accusing hopeful Joe Irvine of copying her spouse on Sunday's show.

However, viewers have taken to social media to point out that Natalia  appears to have turned  to a range of different artists including Jessie J, Lady Gaga and even Johnny Depp for fashion tips of her own.

Natalia launched an angry tirade at X Factor New Zealand contestant Joe Irvine, she said that she was 'disgusted,' at the fact that she thought he looked like her husband, Willy Moon 

Natalia launched into a tirade at Joe on the first of the live shows, saying: 'Ladies and gentlemen, I'm just going to state the obvious, we have a doppelgänger in our midst.

'As an artist who respects creative integrity and intellectual property, I am disgusted at how much you've copied my husband.'

Natalia's comments seemed to be based around the fact that Joe had his hair slicked back and was wearing a suit, a look favoured by her fellow judge - and husband of ten months - Willy.

Yet users on Twitter soon posted pictures that showed how Natalia's own  hair and make-up bears a striking resemblance to styles worn by Lily Allen and Elizabeth Taylor.

Some of the the funnier comparisons include Johnny Depp in Charlie and The Chocolate Factory and Lord Farquaad from Shrek.

She's even been compared to astrologer Mystic Meg and Lady Gaga.

Twitter users were quick to comment on the fact that many of Natalia's looks seem to have been influenced by other people, this hilarious example compares her to Johnny Depp in Charlie And The Chocolate Factory

Natalia has also been accused of stealing looks from Lady Gaga, these two images show the two women rocking remarkably similar styles 

In one picture comparison on Twitter, Natalia's bun, blunt fringe and cat eye make-up looks similar to a look worn by Lady Gaga.

While other shots showed pictures of Natalia posing with her hand over one eye which echoed one of Lady Gaga's own photo poses. 

Another black and white shot of Natalia sees her posing with fingers pointing at her temples, miming having a gun pointing to her head.

Singer MIA also posed the same way in a black and white photograph. 

But when asked about Natalia's look being similar to other celebrities' style, a spokesperson for her said: 'I have known and worked with Natalia for over 15 years - she speaks from her heart and says what's she's feeling.

'She's a very talented and passionate young lady. Natalia has always had her own style and many leading international designers are always sending her outfits.'

But in her X Factor attack last night, Natalia, who was born Natalia Noemi Keery-Fisher, lambasted Irvine further,  saying: 'From the hair to the suit, do you not have any value for respect for originality?'

She added: ‘You're a laughing stock. It's cheesy, it's disgusting, I personally found it artistically atrocious.

'I am embarrassed to be sitting here in your presence having to even dignify you with an answer of my opinion.' 

Irvine, who was appearing on the first live episode looked visibly upset by her comments and at one point seemed to be fighting back the tears. 

Her husband Willy Moon, from Wellington, who she married last May,added:  'To me it feels just a little bit cheap and absurd. 

'It's like Norman Bates dressing up in his mother's clothing, it feels a little creepy and I feel like you are going to stitch someone's skin to your face and then kill everybody in the audience.'

This user joked that the cartoon character Dore The Explorer would be mad that Natalia had stolen her hairstyle 

There has been several posts which compare Natalia to Lady Gaga, here the pair shares a similar hair style and sunglasses to the singer 

And Natalia's outburst wasn't the first time she had raised eyebrows while filming the X Factor.

When she first joined the show she was criticised after one round of auditions in Auckland where she apparently swore and screamed at audience members, which included children.

At the time a representative for the show confirmed the incident saying: 'During a long day of filming, The X Factor NZ judge Natalia Kills expressed frustration at the behaviour of some sections of the audience.

'Her words were not well chosen, and both Natalia and TV3 apologise for any offence caused.' 

Since being dropped from the talent show, Natalia  tweeted saying: 'I love you guys, thanks for your support & understanding my passionate opinions! You know what they say about me...' 

She added a link to her video for her song Problem which includes the chorus, 'That girl is a problem.'

This Twitter user joked that Madonna had called and wanted her hair back

But who is this controversial singer and songwriter who, despite working with Madonna and the DJ David Guetta, until last night was barely known in her home country?

Born in West Yorkshire, the grammar school girl travelled extensively with her parents between Jamaica, the UK and Spain.

She became a child actress aged nine and appeared in the BBC's All About Me, voiced Amy Franks in the Radio 4 soap The Archers and made appearances in Casualty, Doctors and Coronation Street. 

Her father experienced a spell in prison and at the age of 14 she left home and began pursuing a music career in earnest in 2003.

Natalia said: 'I moved out when I was almost 15 and spent my whole teenage years with no money, fighting with my boyfriend, joining a cult and getting in trouble with the police.'

She has spoken about having suffered with depression and having been suicidal in her younger years.

And, when in 2013 she released her album Trouble she told Life and Times that she wanted to use it to confess all the bad things she had ever done.

According to Kills these included: 'Stalking my ex-boyfriend, trying to set fire to the house with us both in it, getting taken away by the police, leaving home at 15, making out with strangers and running away to Paris.'

During the X Factor Natalia sat next her to her husband Willy Moon who also had some choice words for X Factor contestant Joe Irvine

She told Digital Spy: 'I remember when I was 19, I loved my boyfriend who didn't love me back so much - disturbingly much - that every time he hurt me I just desperately wanted to jump off the highest bridge I could find, or walk into the fastest truck. 

'I was just completely out of control of my erratic feelings of love and passionate desperation.'

Yet Natalia has admitted in the past that she feels remorse over her actions, telling Electrocutie Music that her album Trouble was inspired by her rocky life: 'You know what? I do have regrets. 

'The album is actually full of regret. There was a point where I left home and was trying to be a grown-up. I had an awful boyfriend who treated me badly. 

'I wound up in a religious cult that I was in for a few years. It kind of shaped my mind to be good and do the right thing. I felt like “doing good” went against my inner nature.'

She is yet to comment on whether she regrets the comments she made on last night's X Factor.
