Arsenal's latest series of Christmas jumper selfies, which were uploaded on to the club's official Twitter account before their home match against Newcastle, comes just days after players posed for pictures while donning festive garments.

Players including Alexis Sanchez, Santi Cazorla, Laurent Koscielny and Kieran Gibbs were pictured wearing Arsenal's snowman-themed jumper, while Arsenal Ladies players Kelly Smith, Rachel Yankey and Danielle Carter were also involved.
