A husband whose young wife died next to him in bed thought she had been dreaming because of the strange gargling noises she had been making.

Mother-of-two Gemma Sinclair suffered a heart attack and suddenly died as she lay in bed next to husband Jamie - her childhood sweetheart.

But Mr Sinclair, from Wolverhampton, was woken by his wife making a rasping noise, and laughed, thinking she was deeply asleep.

But just moments later, she was dead.

Her 12-year-old daughter desperately tried to perform CPR on her mother while her husband called for an ambulance.

Her heartbroken husband and their two children, Lauren, now 13, and Josh, 11, bid their final farewells to her a to the day after they had celebrated their wedding. 

This week, an inquest in Dudley was told that Mrs Sinclair had died from Sudden Adult Death Syndrome.

Mr Sinclair said: 'I remember the vows we said at our wedding, til death to us part was the last one we said- and it’s been the first one to come true.

'It was time to get up for work and Gemma was making weird gurgling noises.

'She had her back to me and I was laughing at her, and saying "Why are you making that noise?"

'I was tapping her shoulder, and I wasn’t sure if she was joking or dreaming, until I turned to see her face and realised something was terribly wrong.

'She slipped away from me so quickly - one minute everything was perfect and the next she was gone.'

The couple met as teenagers and had spent twelve years saving for their dream wedding before finally tying the knot at St Bartholomew’s Church

Mrs Sinclair, a chef, had woken her husband with strange gurgling noises just before 6.30am when they were both in bed at their home.

Later, Mr Sinclair said: 'I didn’t get to say hello to her that day let alone say goodbye.

'I’ll always remember the vows we said at our wedding. ‘Till death do us part’ was the last one, and the first one to come true.

'Nobody could have predicted that this was going to happen.

'Christmas
 was the worst because Gemma wasn’t there and it was Lauren’s birthday 
just five days later, the first without her mum.

'All the adverts on TV were about families hugging and it was very hard.

'She was so precious and her smile was infectious.

'She worked so hard in the cafe and was a great mother to our two children.

'Lauren is only 13 and Josh is 11 but they have both been my rock.

'They must have got their strength from Gemma because they have really supported me.

'I am heartbroken. I’ve lost my best friend and my soulmate.'

Coroner Robin Balmain said her death was 'desperately sad', and recorded a verdict of natural causes.
