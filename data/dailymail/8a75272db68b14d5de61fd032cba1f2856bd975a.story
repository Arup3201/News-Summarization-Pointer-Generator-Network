Ellar Coltrane is the movie critics' new darling. Acclaimed for his breakthrough starring role in the Golden Globe-winning Boyhood, the 20-year-old with his pouty lips, occasional nose ring and diffident air heats up red carpets wherever he goes.

Already he has been named Best Young Actor at the Critics' Choice Awards and is nominated by the Screen Actors Guild along with his onscreen parents Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette and sister Lorelei Linklater for best ensemble cast. 'Boyhood' is considered one of the leading contenders for Best Movie at next month's Oscars.

But Coltrane's Hollywood high life is all a world away from the rusting 50-year-old school bus that his maternal grandmother calls home.

Hippie grandma: The grandmother of Boyhood star Ellar Coltrane,  Kathy Horton,  lives a world away from Hollywood in a decades old school bus with her five dogs, two cats and 17 chickens 

The reel deal: Ellar Coltrane in a scene from Boyhood with 'reel' mom Oscar nominated Patricia Arquette

Real mom: One-year-old Ellar with his mother Genevieve Kinney in Austin, Texas in 2003. Genevieve, 49, has been married and divorced three times - just as  Patricia Arquette was in Boyhood

Real dad: Bruce Salmon - his mother's second husband - is a musician like Ethan Hawke in the film

Kathy Horton lives in the bus alone, except for her five dogs, two cats and 17 chickens all of which have free rein over the living quarters and the two mattresses slung in the back.

The aging hippie pays $125 a month to park it on a small plot at the end of a dead-end road in Elgin, 20 miles east of Austin, Texas.

Horton, 69, rarely speaks to members of her family, and admits she hasn't had contact with Ellar in three years. But, in an exclusive interview with Daily Mail Online she says she has heard he is 'happy, happy, happy' with his new-found fame.

Ellar's much-heralded performance spans 12 years

She remembers the early years of the movie, which took 12 years to make. 'Ellar would go away for a couple of weeks and come back with a lot of money — I think it was around $1,500 each time. That doesn't sound much now but for a young boy it was a lot and his mother let him buy whatever he wanted.'

Four years ago the budding star moved in with her. 'I had a house on Jessie Street in Austin. I was looking after my uncle before he had to go into a rest home. We had a garage down below and Ellar wanted to make it his apartment. He was only 16 at the time.

'But it rained and he got flooded out.'

When asked if she misses her family, Horton launches into a rambling explanation involving Adam and Eve and the people on their perimeter, which carries a basic message that once a man is grown he should leave his family behind.

Horton has seen Boyhood, but unlike her favorite movie Titanic with Leonardo DiCaprio which she says she watched for 14 days straight, she only saw it once. 'I can't get the DVD to work now,' she said.

Simple life: A vegetarian, Kathy mainly lives on eggs from her chickens and what she can grow. 'I eat sprouts,' she explains. 'I've got radish and alfalfa and, and…that other kind.' She says the only thing she misses about her old life is kissing

Tragedy: Breaking into tears, Kathy explains that her beloved black Labrador Abigail crawled into her SUV unknown to her. She shut the door and didn't realize until too late that the two-year-old dog was inside. Abigail died of heat exhaustion

She said there are parts of her grandson's life woven into the story. Just like Arquette's character, Ellar's mother Genevieve Kinney, 49, Kathy's daughter, has been married and divorced three times. In the movie, two of those marriages break down when the husband turns to drink.

'That didn't happen in Genevieve's life,' says Horton. 'There was no heavy drinking there.'

Genevieve's first husband Patrick McGarrigle was several years older than her. She met him because he had initially been seeing Kathy. 'We didn't date, we were hippies. Hippies don't date,' said Horton.

'My problem was I never told Patrick I loved him. Perhaps he'll read this and realize I did.'

Her second husband, Bruce Salmon is Ellar's father. Like Ethan Hawke in the movie, he is a musician. Ellar — born Ellar Coltrane Kinney Salmon — decided against using his family names professionally as, he said, it was 'too personal.'

Genevieve's third marriage to landscaper Russell Womack ended two years ago. The family has been told by moviemakers IFC Films not to speak to the media without permission, Womack told DailyMail.com.

But that message apparently didn't get to Kathy Horton in her isolated school bus in Elgin. She hasn't left her patch of land in 14 months, despite owning a decade-old Isuzu Trooper.

Breaking into tears, she explains that her beloved black Labrador Abigail crawled into the SUV unknown to her. She shut the door and didn't realize until too late that the 2-year-old dog was inside. Abigail died of heat exhaustion.

Ellar and his mother's first husband, Patrick McGarrigle,  taken at the wedding of the actor's uncle's in 2010. The young actor currently lives in Austin with Patrick, according to Kathy, who was in a relationship with McGarrigle before her daughter and regrets not telling him she loved him

'How could I go back inside that car now?' she asks.

'I do need to go to the dentist for some work on my teeth,' said Horton. 'But I can't get there.'

Now she has a new black Lab, which she also calls Abigail. That dog had three puppies on New Year's Eve which are now beginning to crawl over her bed. A tan Chihuahua called Pookie also shares the bus.

Horton was wearing a frayed and ripped blue dress which ended a good six inches above the knee. She walked through her garden barefoot with her long 'golden ochre' hair cascading over her shoulders.

'Please report that my hair is golden ochre,' she urged. She got the term from 'Angelsea,' a song by her favorite artist, Cat Stevens. 'Don't you agree that I have golden ochre hair?'

A neighbor who works at Walmart brings back groceries, she said. Others who live nearby aren't so accepting of her eccentric life.

'One guy is trying to get me to leave. He shoots up in the air with his 20-gauge about eight times a day. I hear the pellets landing on the roof of the bus.' Almost on cue we hear a boom and seconds later shotgun pellets rain down around us.

'I called the cops on him first time he did it, but they said there's nothing they could do. But it's real pesky.'

Horton wants to have her old bus towed to land she says she once owned four miles away on Texas Route 973. 'I think I'll get it back in four years time,' she said. 'I bought it in 1973 and it's on Route 973, so getting it back when I'm 73 makes sense.

'There's no water here. My land had a beautiful pond with trees and water plants. You could hear the fairies. But I'm one-sixteenth American Indian and a hippy and I thought I didn't need property — another bad decision!'

Grandpa: Kathy quit her job as secretary to the Dean of Arts and Sciences at the University of Texas when she was in her mid-20s, she said. Then she walked out on her husband, Girard Kinney, a successful architect whose work is dotted throughout Austin, taking Ellar's mom, then aged six, with her

Still, Horton has no regrets about the life she chose. She threw up her job as secretary to the Dean of Arts and Sciences at the University of Texas when she was in her mid-20s, she said. 

Then she walked out on her husband, Girard Kinney, a successful architect whose work is dotted throughout Austin, taking Genevieve, then aged six, with her.

She and Kinney left the Texas capital to work in Crystal City, Texas, a border town that was roiled when it elected an all-Mexican-American city council in the early 1960s.

'That's where I became a hippie,' she said. 'My husband took me there, but he also lost me there.' She remarried and had two more children, but that marriage ended too.

Horton bought the bus for $500. She fell in love with the solid cedar roof a previous owner had installed. Now, more than 40 years later the cedar's aroma still fills the vehicle.

Her yard is littered with empty gallon milk containers and corn kernels pecked bare by the hens. She has a washer-dryer combination in a lean-to shed and a large refrigerator stands outside the bus.

Pride of place is an old horse trough, in which, Horton says, she gave birth to the youngest of her three children, Leamarie in 1985. 'It was a water birth. We heated the water up to 105 degrees and put a lot of salt in it.'

A vegetarian, she mainly lives on eggs from her chickens and what she can grow. 'I eat sprouts,' she explains. 'I've got radish and alfalfa and, and…that other kind.'

She says the only thing she misses about her old life is kissing. 'Why can't men kiss anymore? Not the open mouth, tongue in throat kind, but with the lips. My husband had the most wonderful lips, just like Ellar's.

'Oh, and bathtubs. I really miss soaking in a bathtub. I have a shower here, but it's not the same.'
