A 46-year-old man says he is 'outraged' after allegedly being kicked out of a Nottingham nightclub for being 'too old'.

Chris Pettifor says he was trying to get into heavy-metal night Phlebas at Bar Eleven in Nottingham city centre on Tuesday when the incident happened.

The casino cashier says he was with a group of friends when two doormen approached and told him he couldn't come inside. 

Chris Pettifor, 46, a casino cashier, was trying to get into heavy-metal night Phlebas at Bar Eleven in Nottingham (pictured), when he says two doormen told him he was 'too old' to come in

He said: 'When I got home I thought, 'how dare they?' It is embarrassing. I was flabbergasted.

'I didn't bother arguing because if you've been refused, there's no point. I just left.

'I know the place is very young and you don't tend to see anyone over the age of 21 in there, but that shouldn't make a difference.'

Mr Pettifor, from West Bridgford, Nottingham, was heading to the alternative night which features indie, rock, house, punk, drum'n'bass and hip hop music with  group of friends.

His companions say they are also outraged over the way he was treated.

Melody O'Keefe, 32, said she is disgusted in the way her friend of two years has been treated.

She said: 'There's a big group of us and we're proud that we're all of different ages.

'The situation is absolutely terrible. I've checked to see whether there was an age limit to the club night but I couldn't find anything.'

Rob Symes, who runs Phlebas which is described as plaiying a mix of indie, rock, house, punk, drum'n'bass and hip hop music, said Mr Pettifor could have been turned away 'for any number of reasons'

Rob Symes, who runs the Phlebas club night, said: 'The only two people who could have spoken to Chris were the doorman and it is their job to make sure everyone is safe.

'He could have been turned away for a number of reasons. I don't know anything about the man.' 

Manager Michael Freeborn added : 'As I have no experience of Chris Pettifor, having never met him, I simply cannot offer a reason as to why he was rejected but I can state with utter confidence it would not have been due to his age.'
