Tim Sherwood is the leading contender to replace sacked Alan Irvine with West Bromwich Albion keen to make an appointment by the weekend.

The former Tottenham Hotspur head coach came close to landing the Hawthorns job last summer but talks collapsed over wages and Sherwood’s desire to bring in assistants Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey.

Those hurdles could be overcome on this occasion with the futures of current assistants Keith Downing and Rob Kelly uncertain. 

Alan Irvine has been sacked as manager of West Brom after a difficult start to the season

'The individual progress of our players such as Craig Dawson and Saido Berahino are testament to that.

'But sadly that simply has not translated into results and they remain the ultimate currency of Alan's position.

'Securing a sixth season in the Premier League is the over-riding target and sometimes unpleasant decisions have to be taken to serve that imperative.

Irvine's team have been on a bad run and they were beaten 2-0 by Stoke in the Premier League on Sunday 

The pair will take charge of West Brom for the clash with West Ham United on New Year’ s Day but a club statement announcing Irvine’s sacking failed to guarantee their futures.

Tony Pulis is also in the frame but it is unclear how he would work within West Brom’s continental structure where head coach leaves transfers to the technical director, in this case Terry Burton. 

The club announced Irvine's departure with immediate effect on Monday night with the Scot being placed on gardening leave.

'We appointed Alan in the summer convinced that we had taken on one of the foremost coaches in the UK and nothing that has happened since then has altered our view,' technical director Terry Burton said.

'Alan has impressed everyone with his manner, dedication and diligence but he knows that results have simply not been good enough.

'We place on record our gratitude for his efforts and hold nothing but good wishes for his future endeavours. This was a decision taken with regret but sadly driven by necessity.'

Chairman Jeremy Peace, who fired both Steve Clarke and Pepe Mel last season, had been keen to make the summer appointment of Irvine work and knows the players have been fully behind his methods. 

But after travelling fans subjected Irvine to a barrage of abuse at the end of Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Stoke City, the 56-year-old's time at the Hawthorns has come to an end. 

Irvine has overseen a dismal run of results that have seen West Brom win just once in the last nine Premier League games, leaving the club one point above the relegation zone.
