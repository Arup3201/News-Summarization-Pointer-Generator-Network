John Bercow's chief spin doctor resigned today after launching an astonishing political attack on the Conservatives, Labour and UKIP.

Justine McGuinness dramatically quit barely 24 hours after describing the three parties as a ‘collection of clowns’.

In an extraordinary rant at the Liberal Democrat conference in Glasgow, she accused the Conservatives of trying to ‘buy the election’, and blasted Ukip’s ‘utterly perverted notion of patriotism’.

Commons Speaker John Bercow is supposed to be politically neutral, but his spokesman Justine McGuinness (right) used a speech to the Lib Dem party conference to launch an attack on other rival parties

She also attacked Labour for trying to ‘steal the election’ by supporting a ‘biased’ electoral system.

Miss McGuinness, a longtime Lib Dem activist, was speaking in a personal capacity. But her comments appeared to breach the longstanding convention that the Speaker’s office must remain neutral on party political matters.

Last night Tory MP Michael Fabricant  said the tirade called into question Mr Bercow’s judgment in hiring Miss McGuinness – and called on him to sack her.

Today it was announced Miss McGuinness had resigned. In a statement, Mr Bercow's office said: 'After a year in post Justine McGuinness has offered her resignation to the Speaker, which has been accepted. 

'The Speaker thanks Ms McGuinness for her hard work and commitment over the last 12 months.

'She has contributed considerably to the running of the Speaker's Office but now wishes to pursue other interests.' 

Miss McGuinness, a former media adviser to Kate and Gerry McCann, has been involved in Lib Dem politics for years.

She previously stood for Parliament against Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin. She is employed by the Commons on a freelance basis for an undisclosed sum, and is not a civil servant.

But the highly political nature of her comments is likely to raise concerns at Westminster.

Tory MP Michael Fabricant said Mr Bercow could not employ someone who was so overtly political

Addressing activists from the main podium, she said: ‘The next general election campaign will be a really ugly business.

‘The Tories will aim to buy the election with the millions of pounds donated to them by their hot money, hedge fund friends.

‘Labour will seek to steal the election, relying on an electoral system so biased in their favour that 35 per cent of the vote could deliver them 55 per cent of the seats.

‘Ukip will try and hijack the election, turning the whole event into an argument about Europe and immigration as Nigel Farage swans around suburbia selling himself as some sort of suburban, saloon bar Socrates.

‘And the one thing that will connect this collection of clowns will be a desperate determination to marginalise the Liberal Democrats, for what they all fear above all else is that once again the British people will put the balance of power into our hands.

‘The Lib Dems will offer this country a fair deal. Labour have their warped sense of the term equality, the Tories are welcome to their twisted notion of freedom, and Ukip are welcome to their utterly perverted notion of patriotism. Fairness is what we will stand for.’

Speaking last night, Mr Fabricant said the remarks meant Mis McGuinness could not remain in post.  

He said: ‘The Speaker has to be politically neutral and has to be seen to be so. How then can he employ someone as his official spokesman who has nailed her colours to the mast in a political rant against the Conservatives and Labour?

‘This calls into question yet again the judgment of John Bercow. If she is still employed by him this evening after this then she should no longer be so. It is essential for the integrity of Parliament that the neutrality of the Speaker’s office is maintained.'

The row is an unwelcome development for Mr Bercow, who is already embroiled in controversy over his bid to appoint Australian Carol Mills as the new Commons Clerk despite widespread concerns she is not qualified for the job.
