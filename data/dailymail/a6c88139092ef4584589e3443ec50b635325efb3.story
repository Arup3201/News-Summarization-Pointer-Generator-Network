One of London's main railway stations was evacuated this morning when a fire broke out on a train.

Passengers were ordered to leave Charing Cross after a 'screech and a bang' around the front carriage of the 10.55am departure to Robertsbridge, East Sussex, after it pulled into platform six.

Five fire engines were sent to the scene as passengers screamed and ran for the exit amid false reports of a bomb. No one was hurt, despite the driver being in the cab at the time.

Fire: London's Charing Cross station was evacuated today after a blaze broke out on the platform

Witnesses: Passengers were on the platform when the fire took hold, and were swiftly evacuated

Officers were able to deal with the fire quickly, but it also caused smoke damage to a live wire and the hotel next door.

Marketing worker Jacob Lovie, 22, was waiting for a train to London Bridge when he heard what sounded like an explosion.

Mr Lovie said it appeared the train may have hit the buffers - though this claim was flatly denied by rail operator Southeastern, which said the cause was an electrical fault.

He told MailOnline: 'I was sitting on the platform and there was this loud screech and a big bang. Smoke went everywhere and a few people were screaming.

'It looked like a train hadn't braked properly and had gone into the big buffer at the end of the track.

'People were jogging quite calmly to the exit and the alarms were going off. I was outside when the first police car came and told everyone to move away.

One witness told MailOnline: 'I was sitting on the platform and there was this loud screech and a big bang'

Another witness said: 'There were quite a lot of flames and flashing lights as well. People were just all running out of there... They tried to stay calm but there were definitely people running'

'I didn't see anyone hurt but there was a big bang and it was still on fire afterwards. It looked as though the fire was more on the platform and the building around it than the actual locomotive.

'The staff were clearing everyone out very quickly so it hit people more when they got outside the station and everyone was like "woah". There was one woman who looked really shaken up.'

Eileen Harris, 60, and her son Daniel, 26, were on the train to travel to Tunbridge Wells in Kent when the fire started.

Ms Harris said: 'Suddenly the doors burst open and a woman ran through shouting "there's a bomb on the train, everybody get off".

'We ran away towards the opposite end of the station because I thought that if there was a bomb, they'd probably take out the concourse.

'But the staff kept saying to us come back in and we really didn't want to come back through the station, because by then there was thick smoke.

'We were marshalled out here and told that it'd be closed for a very long time, and then the emergency services turned up.

'Where the fire was there were big bangs and pops and flashes. And the smoke, the smoke was the worst thing.'

Mr Harris added: 'There was fire and lots of thick smoke, so we assumed that there was a bomb ripping through the train.

'People were running through the train, and my first thought was the reason they're running down the train is because they can't get off.

'No-one really knew what was going on.'

They left their possessions and Ms Harris' coat on the train, and the police retrieved them for her.

The six-platform station between Trafalgar Square and the River Thames is a main terminal for trains from Kent, Sussex and south east London and handles almost 40 million passengers a year.

Rail operator Southeastern said there were delays of more than two hours on some services as they were diverted to other stations, including London Bridge and Victoria.

Charing Cross London Underground station was closed for 15 minutes but swiftly reopened. The mainline station remained closed until after 1pm.

A Southeastern spokesman said: 'It definitely didn't hit the buffer - it was an electrical problem that's being investigated now but we suspect it may have been where the train shoes come into contact with the conductor rail to power the train.

'There may have been something that went wrong with that part of the train. That's being investigated right now by engineers on site.' 

A London Fire Brigade spokesman told MailOnline: 'There was a fire reported on a train at 10.52. Five fire engines were in attendance and the fire is now out on the train but we are dealing with the smoke damage to the hotel next door.

Response: More than 20 firefighters were called to the scene next to London's Trafalgar Square

The station remained closed for more than two hours as firefighters cleared up the aftermath of the blaze

'It was a six carriage train and it was on platform six and the front carriage was five percent damaged by fire.

'The adjacent live rail was also damaged and there is smoke damage to the front carriage.'

The spokesman said there had been no reports of an explosion at the station, and the cause of the 'small fire' was being investigated.

Vincenzo Minore, a cosmetics firm chief executive, published several photos and a video titled simply: 'Run, run run'.

Annika Anwary, who works in the station and saw the fire, said: 'I was in the staffroom. I heard the alarm so I came upstairs and I saw the train was burning on the platform.

'There were quite a lot of flames and flashing lights as well. People were just all running out of there. Most of them had already left by the time I came up.

'They tried to stay calm but there were definitely people running.'

A London Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We were called at 10.55am to reports of a fire on a train at Charing Cross.

'We sent a duty manager to the scene and two patients were checked over, but nobody was taken to hospital.

'Our involvement in the incident has now concluded.'

A statement posted on National Rail's website said: 'A fire at London Charing Cross is causing disruption to journeys between London Charing Cross / London Blackfriars and London Bridge.

'Because of congestion caused by trains being diverted, Thameslink trains will not call at stations between London Blackfriars and East Croydon.

Emergency response: The station was cordoned off as paramedics, police and firefighters attended

Central: Charing Cross is between Trafalgar Square and the River Thames and is used by 40 million a year

'Trains are currently unable to run to and from London Charing Cross. Some services will be diverted to start / terminate at London Victoria or London Bridge.

'There is no firm estimate yet of how long disruption will last but it is likely to continue until at least 1.30pm.

'Passengers travelling further south than Orpington please travel from London Victoria.

'Passengers travelling towards Dartford and Hayes please travel from London Bridge.'

A British Transport Police (BTP) spokesman said: 'Officers from BTP attended platform 6 at Charing Cross railway station after a report at 10.50am on Sunday, 23 November, of a fire.

'At this stage, the fire is believed to have been the result of an electrical fault and there are no suspicious circumstances.

'The station was evacuated as precaution and no one was injured.'
