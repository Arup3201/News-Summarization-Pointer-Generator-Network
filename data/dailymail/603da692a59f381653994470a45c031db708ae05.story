A sculpture exhibition showcasing the best of Victorian craftsmanship will soon be unveiled at Tate Britain. 

Among the collection is a 7ft ceramic elephant and range of jewellery from Chatsworth House as well as bronze and marble sculptures.  

The exhibition, titled Sculpture Victorious, will be shown at Tate Britain from February 25 for three months.

Among pieces included in Sculpture Victorious is a 7ft ceramic elephant by Thomas Longmore and John Henk dating back to 1889. The exhibition is being shown at Tate Britain until the end of May

Intricate metalwork and jewellery is also featured in the collection. Above, The Eglington Trophy, created in 1843 by Edumund Cotterill and R&S Garrard

Among its sculptures is the well-known Athlete Wrestling with a Python by Frederic Leighton and Hiram Powers' Greek Slave. 

A Royal Game, a bronze statue by Sir William Reynolds-Stephens depicting Queen Elizabeth I and Philip of Spain is also part of the collection. 

Perhaps the most noticeable piece is Thomas Longmore and John Henk's 1889 Elephant, a towering 7ft tall. 

The Victorian era brought about a flurry of productivity among British sculptors with artists able to access a wider range of materials. 

The sculpture imagines the political and religious struggle between Elizabeth I and Philip of Spain, with the latter's chess pieces the ships of the Armada and the British queen's the fleet that destroyed them

Constant building and development created more places for their works to be displayed while monuments erected across the country inspired more art. 

Queen Victoria was reportedly a great fan of the art form which had already seen wide success across Europe. 

It was under her reign that pieces were commissioned for the first time to decorate the Houses of Parliament. 

In addition to a surge in the number of large sculptures and statues, artists began to consult manufacturers about their production of intricate materials. 

This brought about an increase in detailed jewellery and smaller ornaments, both of which are showcased in the Tate Britain collection.
