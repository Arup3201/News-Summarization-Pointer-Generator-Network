A jobless man died after a vibrator became lodged in his body and was too embarrassed to see a doctor, an inquest has heard.

Nigel Willis, 50, could not remove the sex toy and spent five days lying on the sofa, unable to get up because of the agonising pain, at a house he shared with his elderly mother in Forest Hill, south-east London.

A friend begged him to get help, and he eventually went to University Hospital Lewisham suffering from septic shock.

Treatment: Nigel Willis, 50, was taken to University Hospital Lewisham in south east London after the sex toy became stuck inside him. The pain meant he couldn't move from his sofa for five days

Southwark Coroner's Court heard he was admitted to intensive care on New Year’s Eve 2013 as a result.

Surgeons managed to remove the vibrator, but he died two months later after failing to recover from his injuries.

A consultant at the hospital, Dr Adebowale Adesina, told the hearing: ‘The history was that his friend or carer called an ambulance because he complained of dizziness, weakness and was unable to move from the sofa for five days.’

It was discovered Mr Willis had a ‘foreign body’ in his anus and he underwent emergency surgery.

Doctor Bernd Rose, a consultant with the intensive care unit, said: ‘Mr Willis was a 50-year-old gentleman with a history of diabetes. Together with his neighbour he looked after his very elderly mother who he lived with.’

Hearing: Southwark Coroner's Court was told that the 'foreign object' caused Mr Willis to suffer septic shock

In a statement read at the inquest he said Mr Willis had been unable to remove the vibrator which he had inserted into his rectum days before his admission to hospital.

‘He was admitted to the ITU on December 31, he had a very prolonged ITU stay,’ he added. Mr Willis’s condition deteriorated and he became less responsive, dying at 7am on February 7 this year.

Assistant Coroner to inner-south London Sarah Ormand-Walshe said: ‘This is a sad case of a man who died at 50 years of age.

‘He appears to have had a foreign object which has become stuck in the lower part of his bowel and had been there for a number of days when he was encouraged to go to hospital by his friends on 30 December 2013.' 

Ms Ormand-Walshe said Mr Willis was left ‘fighting for his life’ over the ensuing days. ‘The main cause of death clearly is just the abdomen injury,’ she said.

The coroner ruled Mr Willis died as a result of an accident.
