Loss: Edward Harris, 3, died after climbing into a pool behind his daycare center on Thursday

A three-year-old boy has drowned in a swimming pool at the New York daycare where his mother works.

Edward Harris had wandered past a gate and into the garden while his mom, Maria Johnson, 22, was inside the Mother Byrd Family Day Care Center on Staten Island on Thursday.

At around 5.40pm, she realized her son was not with his grandfather, who had just taken them on an errand, and saw the boy floating in the water and pulled him out, the New York Times reported.

His grandfather, Robert Battipaglia, a former lifeguard, rushed to the boy and attempted to give him CPR and the youngster vomited over him as he did so - but still he could not be revived.

Battipaglia,
 who thought that Johnson was watching her son through a window 
overlooking the yard, said he was struggling with the knowledge he had 
not reached his step-grandson quick enough.

'I
 was the first person to respond, but I got there too late,' he said. 
'I'll never be able to live this down 'til the day I die.'

When paramedics arrived, Edward was in cardiac arrest and responders tried to revive him.Â

He was rushed to Richmond University Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.

'He was a good, happy boy, his mother told the New York Daily News. 'He was my only son.'

Edward had taken off all of his clothes before jumping in the pool, Johnson's cousin Anjie Johnson said.

Sources told the New York Post the boy had stacked up boxes, climbed them and jumped in.

Danger: There is only a fence (seen top) to separate the daycare from the swimming pool. The boy was found floating in the water about 10 minutes after he was last seen and could not be saved

'He was a very fast-moving kid,' she said. 'In a second, if you look away he won't be where you told him to be... She's trying hard to deal with it, but it's hard.'

The daycare center, owned by Sherris Byrd, is licensed to take of 12 children, according to records of the Office of Children and Family Services.

A police spokesman said investigators believed the boy's death was an accident. The medical examiner has yet to release the cause of death.
