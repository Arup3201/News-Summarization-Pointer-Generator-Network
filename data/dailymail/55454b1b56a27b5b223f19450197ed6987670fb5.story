A 22-year-old college student whose disappearance had police scouring Southern California for weeks said she was overwhelmed with personal problems when she decided to walk away.

Sahray Barber, whose March 9 disappearance triggered a huge land and air search across Southern California's Inland Empire, resurfaced on March 19.

She had spent the ten days living in two Los Angeles-area hospitals under assumed names.

After leaving the second hospital, she met a woman who treated her kindly and finally got her to open up and to reach out to her father, Barber said.

Barber called her father from a shelter after seeing news reports about her case and asked to come home.

While she was gone, a huge search involving aircraft, dogs and horseback riders was being carried out by police. 

Barber released a statement to the Riverside Press-Enterprise Enterprise on Thursday trying to explain what happened to her. 

She said she had lost her job, her car had been wrecked and computer problems were causing her to fall behind in her studies at the Art Institute of California-Inland Empire.

She wrote: 'Things got so bad that I didn't know what to say or who to ask for help, 

'I had dug a hole so deep, that I felt entirely hopeless.'

Barber indicated that she paid little attention to media reports of the search while she was in the hospital, but was stunned when she found out all it involved. 

The young woman called what she did 'incredibly dumb'.

She wrote: 'I ask for everyone's forgiveness, most especially my wonderful family for all the worry and long nights I caused you, and all the amazing men, women, dogs and horses that searched for me.'

On the day she vanished, Barber walked out of her apartment, threw her computer and a few other belongings over a wall and left with just a few dollars in her pocket.

Her disappearance was even more concerning because two women had recently been assaulted on the campus of California State University, San Bernardino, near Barber's home.

San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said the department will seek criminal charges against Barber's roommates.

They gave statements to police that indicated Barber had been killed, according to Burguan.

It's possible that Barber will face charges as well due to the scope and cost of the investigation.
