Rickie Lambert has arrived in Liverpool for his medical ahead of a £4million move to Merseyside.

The Southampton striker, who was an unused substitute during England's 3-0 win against Peru on Friday night, was released by the Reds when he was just 15.

Now Lambert looks set to link-up with Brendan Rodgers' side, should he complete routine tests without hiccup.

The initial £4m fee will rise according to the appearances he makes, while the club were keen to keep his whereabouts under wraps.

He arrived at Liverpool Spire Hospital at around nine o'clock on Saturday morning; after the medical, a club car reversed right up to the entrance before bundling the striker into the back.

Lambert was then taken to the club's training ground at Melwood ahead of a flight back down to Southampton later in the afternoon.

The 32-year-old, who began his career at Liverpool’s academy, will be the first major arrival in what is expected to be a busy summer for the club.

He could even be followed by two of his team-mates from Southampton, as Liverpool are still negotiating for £25m-rated Adam Lallana and have also targeted Dejan Lovren to bolster their defence.

A boyhood Liverpool fan, Lambert finally looks set to earn his big move after a career largely spent in the lower leagues. He wasn't deemed strong enough by Steve McMahon at Blackpool as a youngster before moves to Macclesfield, Stockport, Rochdale and Bristol Rovers. Alan Pardew then spent £1million to take the target man to St Mary's in 2009.

Rodgers wanted the deal done before Roy Hodgson takes his side away to Brazil for the start of the World Cup.

Lambert scored 16 goals for club and country last season and will provide the Premier League title chasers with a different option up front to supplement Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge.

Odds on: A flurry of bets had been placed on Rickie Lambert joining Liverpool on Thursday

Ambition: Lambert will be the first major arrival in what is expected to be a busy period for Liverpool
