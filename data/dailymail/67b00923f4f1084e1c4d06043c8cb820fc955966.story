This is the dramatic moment French soldiers parachuted into Mali to recapture the city of Timbuktu from the hands of Islamic militants.

Pictures released by the French Army Communications Audiovisual office show dozens of paratroopers falling from the sky above Timbuktu airport on Tuesday before joining soldiers from the Malian army to advance into the historical city.

A total of 250 French paratroopers were dropped in as part as part of Operation Serval to recapture Timbuktu. They were greeted as liberating heroes by the townspeople with the extremists melting away into the desert without firing a shot.

Dropping in: French paratroopers fal;l from the sky above Timbuktu airport in Mali as part of Operation Serval to recapture the historical city

Supplies are dropped into Timbuktu airport. French military intervention in Mali has now entered the fourth week, after rapidly forcing Islamist militants retreat from major towns

Today ecstatic children gathered at a schools across Timbuktu which re-opened
for the first time in the ten months since Islamists seized 
control of the city denying them an education.

Women who had been forced to wear veils and stay indoors under the strict Islamic law that had been in force were seen dancing in the streets to celebrate the militants' departure.

It comes as Malian soldiers were accused of 
using torture tactics similar to waterboarding on three al-Qaeda-linked 
terrorists captured during the liberation of Timbuktu.

The three men are being held in an earthen cell in what remains of the military camp in Timbuktu, which was captured by French and Malian soldiers after nearly 10 months under the rule of radical Islamists.

The men, who were tied together with a turban and one handcuff, admitted to reporters to being members of the al-Qaeda-linked group known as Ansar Dine, or Defenders of the Faith.

One of the men, who gave his name as 
Ali Guindo and said he was from a village near the central Malian town 
of Niono, described the tactics used by his captors.

He
said: 'To force me to talk they poured 40 liters of water in my mouth 
and over my nostrils which made it so that I could not breathe anymore.

'For a moment I thought I was even going to die. I sleep in the cold and every night they come pour freezing water over me.'

All three prisoners described similar treatment. Their account could not be independently verified.

Soldiers holding the three men asked reporters to leave after initially allowing journalists to speak with them.

Colonel
Mamary Camara of the Malaian army told reporters that the three were 
arrested by Malian forces in the town of Lere, and he said that one of 
the men was from Libya and was caught wearing a foreign military 
uniform.

The Libyan jihadist was visibly frightened, crouching in a corner of his cell. He gave reporters contradictory information about his background, first saying he was born in a Malian village but of Libyan descent.

Later, he said he was from Tripoli but has lived for years in Mali. He initially denied being part of Ansar Dine but later confirmed that he belonged to the movement though he denied having an important role.

The Malian military said that when he was arrested he was wearing a watch with a memory card inside that they said was used to communicate with other foreign jihadists.

The allegations of torture made public Friday in Timbuktu come as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International released reports Friday outlining other allegations of misconduct by the Malian military over the last month.

According to Amnesty International witnesses claim the Malian army had arrested more than 24 civilians on the eve of the French-led intervention some of whom are feared to have been killed

Amnesty International cited witnesses saying the Malian army had arrested more than 24 civilians on the eve of the French-led intervention on Jan. 11.

Amnesty says it is feared that many were later killed by soldiers and some bodies were thrown down a well in Sevare.

The Associated Press had earlier reported killings of civilians by the Malian army in Sevare, with bodies dumped in a well.

The Malian government has promised to investigate allegations of human rights abuses by its soldiers.

France has said that it eventually wants to hand over responsibility for the mission to the Malian army and other African counterparts.
