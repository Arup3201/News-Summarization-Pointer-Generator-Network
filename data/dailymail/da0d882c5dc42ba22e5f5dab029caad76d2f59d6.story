Philip Goodeve-Docker, pictured training for the trip, died in Greenland during a -70C snowstorm

The friends of a novice Arctic explorer who died during a fundraising trek across Greenland said they huddled together for warmth as they battled 'minute by minute' to survive a -70C snowstorm. 

Philip Goodeve-Docker, 31, died as he 
and his friends Roan Hackney and Andy Norman endured a 155mph blizzard that battered their camp for more than 40 hours.

Speaking at Mr Goodeve-Docker's inquest today, Mr Hackney, who suffered severe frostbite, said: 'We were just trying to stay alive, minute by minute.

'It was not a game. It was not human versus human. It was human versus the elements.'

Mr Goodeve-Docker succumbed to the extreme cold and was 
found frozen to death by a rescue team who had battled for 24 hours to 
find the men, and airlift them to safety in a helicopter.

Mr
Hackney and Mr Norman, who both narrowly escaped death, made their way 
into court today still bearing their frostbite injuries as they gave 
evidence to a coroner about the tragedy.

The
month-long charity mission was only in its second day when the huge 
blizzard hit, blowing gusts of 155mph at temperatures as cold as minus 70 degrees Celsius, the coroner heard.

Mr
Goodeve-Docker, a novice explorer, was inspired to go on the on once in
a lifetime expedition by his late grandfather, a former vice- president
of the Royal Geographical Society who had funded the 400-mile polar 
across Greenland’s barren ice sheet.

The
31-year-old from Ealing, London, had written on Facebook that he had 
been 'training furiously' for the mission, which was set to raise tens 
of thousands of pounds of charitable funds for the Queen’s Nursing 
Institute.

He added: 'Part 
of my reasons for this frankly nutty adventure is my grandfather, 
Patrick Pirie-Gordon, who passed away two years ago.'

Mr
Hackney, an experienced polar explorer, told the inquest how the men 
were airlifted to Greenland on April 25 after the start of the adventure
was delayed by five days due to bad weather.

'We had a clear window of opportunity and we were advised to take it by the Greenland authorities,' he said.

'We
had all the necessary kit for the expedition, everything that’s 
required to survive in a polar environment for a month, or two months if
necessary, on a sledge which we dragged behind us.'

The men walked with skis for four 
hours on the first day and set up camp for the night in a specialised 
polar tent designed with three separate compartments each with an escape
route if the weather closed in.

The following day, Mr Hackney said they awoke at 8am to a 'total whiteout' which cleared later that morning.

'We proceeded to cover as much ground as possible,' he said, explaining that they managed to ski for another four hours.

'At 7.30pm, my experience suggested to me it was time to set up camp because there was a storm coming,' he added.

However, nothing could have prepared the men for the 'relentless' snow storm which battered them for the next 40 hours.

Mr
Hackney said they planned to 'sit out the storm' but became concerned 
when tent poles were swept away by the huge blizzard, which brought a 
heavy snow drifted that started to crush the tent.

He
told how Mr Norman, an IT professional from Ascot, Berks., and Mr 
Goodeve- Docker kicked the sides of the tent from the inside to try and 
clear the build-up of snow that was turning their accommodation into a 
frozen prison.

Several times, Mr Hackney said he tried to clear snow by venturing outside but was forced back inside each time.

The final time he tried, the shovel was ripped out of his hand and blown away into the distance.

He
said: 'I was now becoming aware all sides of the tent were becoming 
covered in snow, sleet and ice. There was no sign of abatement.

'The tent was literally crushed within seconds.'

Mr
Norman used a satellite phone to alert Mr Goodeve-Docker’s family in 
Chilbolton, Hants., to the emergency as the men lay on top of each other
in the porch of the tent with the snow engulfing them from all angles.

Mr Hackney said he thought all three of them were going to die in the storm.

He said: 'It was not a game. It was not human versus human. It was human versus the elements.

'We were just trying to stay alive, minute by minute.

He
said snow started entering the porch, burying and choking them. Despite
this, he said he tried to keep spirits up by making his partners repeat
their names back to him and indulging them in a sing-song.

'It was excruciating but we had a sense of purpose and we were determined to stay alive,' he said.

'It was horrible to be able to do nothing about it. I was desperate my team should make it. We had no intention of dying.'

After
many hours battling to cling on, Mr Goodeve-Docker became submerged in 
the snow and died a few hours before rescuers arrived.

The
inquest heard that the surviving pair then slipped into unconsciousness
and were minutes away from death themselves when a break in the storm 
meant a rescue team could land in a helicopter in 60mph winds and get 
them out to a hospital at noon on April 28.

The
inquest held in Basingstoke, Hampshire, heard that Mr Goodeve-Docker’s 
body was found in a frozen state in a sitting position covered in a 
layer of ice.

Coroner Andrew Bradley said a post-mortem examination was carried out 'many hours later' when the ice had melted.

A pathologist found he had died from respiratory and circulatory failure as a result of hypothermia.Giving
evidence, Mr Norman said: 'The start was pretty idyllic really in terms
of the weather. Everything had been going to plan and it carried on 
that way with a few challenges until the storm hit us when we were in 
the tent.

'From then on, it changed quite dramatically.'

Coroner Andrew Bradley expressed his 'great sadness' as he recorded a verdict of misadventure.

He appeared choked and emotional as he revealed he knew Mr Goodeve-Docker personally.

He said: 'It’s a matter of great sadness. This family is known to me and has been known to me for many years.'

He added that the storm had been 'all consuming', and said: 'The appalling events which led up to the death are recalled very graphically by Andy and Roan.

'The best preparation was taken to stand up to the velocity of the storm.

'We have heard about the destruction of the environment, the destruction of the tent and everything that lay in its way, and eventually the destruction of Philip.

'The rescue did not arrive in time for Philip. Fortunately the other two have survived and thank God for that.

'Never was a verdict of misadventure so appropriate.'

Family members of the deceased and the two explorers declined to comment to reporters after the hearing.
