A group of 75 Florida elementary school kids accompanied by teachers and parents arrived at the Pembroke Pines Walmart on Tuesday to perform ‘God Bless America’ in tribute to the September 11 victims, only to be turned away at the door.

Officials at Coconut Palm Elementary School in Miramar said they had arranged in advance for the young chorus members, ages seven to 10, to stage the patriotic tribute, but a representative of the big-box store refused to honor the agreement, forcing the children to sing in the parking lot.

But it was not the end of their troubles. After the group performed the song under a nearby flag that was at half-staff, police arrived on the scene in response to a report about a 'flash mob situation.'

Mean-spirited: School officials said managers at the Pembroke Pines Walmart refused to let the kids sing at the store despite an earlier agreement

On Wednesday evening, a Walmart spokesperson issued an apology on behalf of the store at the center of the controversy, according to News Channel 5.

'We regret this happened and apologize to the students, parents and the school for this experience,' said the spokeswoman Kayla Whaling. 'Unfortunately, this was a situation of miscommunication, and it should have been handled differently.

'We're also inviting the kids back to the store to help honor the victims and fallen heroes.'

The musical homage had been arranged with the Walmart management as part of the elementary school's 'I Will' campaign which encourages people to perform public service on the anniversary of the terrorist attacks.

Principal Terri Thelmas said the patriotic routine was designed as a flash mob that was meant not only to honor the fallen, but also to raise the spirits of Walmart shoppers on this somber occasion.

Thelmas explained that she contacted the store last week and was referred to a manager named Frank, who signed off on the performance at the store. However, when the children and staff arrived on Tuesday night, Frank was not there, and another manager turned them away after calling the chorus 'a liability.'

Disappointed: Fourth-grader Adrianna DiSciascio, nine, said she and other children were crying after being ejected from the store without explanation

Being ousted from the store brought many children to tears as they had practiced hard for the big night.

'The wind was taken out of everybody's sails — from the parents to the teachers to the kids,' said Michael DiSciascio, whose nine-year-old daughter, Adrianna, was part of the chorus.

'We just wanted to honor the people who lost their lives and lost their families, but they just didn't know what was going on, so they just told us to leave,' Adrianna DiSciascio told NBC6.

Despite their disappointment, the children regrouped in the Walmart parking lot and performed the song, which lasted a little over a minute.

As the kids and parents were heading back to their cars, an officer arrived on the scene after receiving a complaint, but in the end, no action was taken as it was decided that the 'flash mob' was not a police matter.

Some outraged parents took to social media sites, posting recordings of the musical tribute and taking the store to task for turning away young children who wanted to do something special to mark the tragic anniversary.  

The Walmart spokeswoman said the store plans to contact the school and arrange for the chorus to come back.
