A 25-year-old Maine mother accused of drugging and smothering her young daughter to death is going on trial today after changing her plea to not guilty by reason of insanity in September.

Leanna Norris was arrested last year after the body her 2-year-old daughter, Loh Grenda, was found in the front seat of her car in Stetson, Maine, on June 23, 2013.

Norris initially pleaded not guilty to murder, but two documents released by Penobscot County Superior Court shortly after her arrest stated that she confessed to the killing.

Late last month, Norris changed her plea to not guilty by reason of insanity and waived her right to a jury trial, meaning that a judge will decide her fate, Bangor Daily News reported. 

According to her affidavit by 
Detective Thomas Pickering of the Maine State Police, on June 27, 2013, the 
Auburn woman said she gave her daughter Loh Grenda two or three doses of
 Benadryl, before putting black duct tape over her mouth and covering her with
 a blanket so she 'would not have to look at Loh's eyes'.

'Leanna Norris said that she killed 
Loh Grenda; that Leanna Norris put her hand over Loh Grenda’s face and 
suffocated her,' the affidavit said.

Benadryl is an antihistamine, which can also cause drowsiness.

Norris, who had been on her way to 
visit her parents in Stetson, said she killed her daughter by covering 
the child's face with her hand, then removed the tape 'so it would not 
look so horrible', according to Portland Press Herald.

Cowardly act: Norris allegedly gave her daughter Benadryl, duct-taped her mouth and covered her with a blanket so she 'would not have to look at Loh's eyes'

Failed suicide: The mother attempted to take her own life by overdosing on Advil, but she survived 

After allegedly killing her child, Norris told police she drove to a cemetery in Stetson, where she overdosed on Advil in an attempt to take her own life.

But, after vomiting, the 24-year-old allegedly called her father, Steven Norris, and then drove to his house.

Mr Norris told detectives his daughter had called at 2.47am telling him 'she killed her baby and wanted to die', according to the document.

He told detectives that when she arrived
 at his home, he found his granddaughter dead under a blanket, and said 
his daughter begged him for a gun so she could kill herself.

Tragic: Loh Grenada's small lifeless body was discovered inside her mother's car 

When police arrived they found the 
body of the child in a car and a note on the dashboard, but police have 
not said what it contained, BDN Maine reported.

Norris' trial is expected to last five days. Superior Court Justice Ann Murray will issue a verdict at a later date.

If convicted of murder, the 25-year-old mother faces 25 years to life. 

If the judge chooses to acquit Norris by reason of insanity, she will be sent to a psychiatric hospital for treatment.
