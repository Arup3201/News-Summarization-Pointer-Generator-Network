Luis Suarez is a better player than Chelsea hitman Diego Costa, according to former Arsenal defender and Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown.

Costa has taken the Premier League by storm since making the move to Chelsea from La Liga champions Atletico Madrid in the summer for £32million.

The Brazilian-born Spain international is leading the way in the goalscoring charts having netted 17 league goals during his debut season in England.

By contrast, Suarez has struggled to recapture the form he showed for Liverpool last season following his £70m switch to Barcelona, having only scored just five goals in 17 appearances for the Catalan giants.

But Keown, who knows better than anyone what it takes to play against a top striker, has revealed he would rather have Suarez lining up for his team than Costa.

'As for who I’d have in my team, that’s a tough one,' the former England international said during his latest edition of Tackle Keown.

'I think Suarez is a better player, though. When Costa played for Spain at the World Cup he was non-existent almost, because he wasn’t emotionally fired up.

'He needs an edge to get himself playing whereas Suarez came back from a serious knee operation and still showed how much quality he had.

'I think Suarez is ahead of Costa and if he was playing for Chelsea you would probably see more goals. But I rate Costa so highly now after his start in the Premier League. 

'But as pure footballers, I think Suarez is better than him.'
