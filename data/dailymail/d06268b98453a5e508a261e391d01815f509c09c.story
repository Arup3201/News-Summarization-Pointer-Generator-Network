He then latches himself onto the roof by grabbing onto the taxi's blue sign and holds on as it continues to make its way across the bridge.

After about 20 seconds, the man climbs down back into the taxi and is commended for his efforts by his friends.

Waitemata Police's Inspector Mark Fergus confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that the 'idiotic and reckless act' was under investigation.

'This sort of road use not only puts the "pranksters" at risk of serious harm or death, but it also puts the safety of innocent road users in jeopardy, and the law-abiding public should not have to share the roads with people who choose to behave in this way,' he said in a statement.

'We warn anyone else who may be thinking of repeating this or performing a similar type of incident that these matters are taken seriously and will be investigated.'
