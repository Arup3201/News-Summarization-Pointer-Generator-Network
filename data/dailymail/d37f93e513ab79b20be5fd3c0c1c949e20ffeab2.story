A new mother killed herself in a hospital room after staff ignored her husband's plea that she should be put on a 24-hour watch, it was claimed last night.

Diana Mager, 33, was being treated at Green Parks House psychiatric unit in Orpington, Kent, after suffering a severe form of post-natal depression after giving birth to Sofia in November 2011.

The HSBC risk manager, who was self-harming and battling chronic anxiety, was admitted in June 2012 but committed suicide in August, at a time when she was being checked every 15 minutes.

She killed herself when she was alone. Earlier on in her stay she had been allowed out on occasions for an hour at a time - but had once tried to jump off the Tate Modern building in central London.

Her husband, IT consultant Adam, 39, is now planning legal action against Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, reported the London Evening Standard.

Mr Mager, who also claimed that his wife once smuggled a kitchen knife into the hospital unit, told the newspaper: ‘Diana was overjoyed at becoming a mother - it was all she ever wanted.

‘I believe she would be alive today if she had received the proper care she desperately needed.  Instead, I have to explain to our daughter why her mother is no longer with us.’

The death of Mrs Mager, who had a history of depression, is being outlined in an inquest which was opened yesterday. It will also highlight a lack of specialist care for post-natal depression.

Mr Mager’s lawyer, Mark Bowman of Field Fisher Waterhouse, based in Aldgate, east London, said his client was ‘concerned that more could and should have been done to help her’.

Trust chief executive Stephen Firn said in a statement to MailOnline: ‘I was deeply saddened by Mrs Mager’s death and would like to express my sincere condolences to her husband and family.

‘We carried out a full and thorough investigation which concluded that it could not have been predicted or prevented.'

The trust said it could not comment further while the inquest is ongoing at South London Coroner's Court in Croydon. It is being held by Coroner Dr Roy Palmer and is expected to finish next Monday.

Post-natal depression usually 
develops in the first four to six weeks after childbirth, although in 
some cases it may not develop for several months.

There
 are many symptoms, such as low mood, feeling unable to cope and 
difficulty sleeping, but many women are not aware they have the 
condition.

It is 
common for women to experience mood changes and episodes of tearfulness 
after giving birth which is sometimes known as the 'baby blues' but 
these normally clear up within a few weeks.

If a woman experiences persistent symptoms, it could be the result of post-natal depression.

The
 cause is not completely clear and experts think it is the result of a 
combination of things including lack of support, money worries or a 
difficult delivery.

But even if someone's life is free of these kind of problems, a woman can still develop post-natal depression.

People
 often assume they will naturally adapt to parenthood but it can take 
months before people begin to cope with the pressures of being a parent.

Factors that increase
 your risk of having postnatal depression include a family history of 
depression or post-natal depression or experiencing other mood disorders
 such as bipolar disorder.

Huge changes in hormone levels during and after pregnancy were once believed to be the sole cause of post-natal depression.

This is no longer thought to be the case, although hormonal changes may still play a part.
