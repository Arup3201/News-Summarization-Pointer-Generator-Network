It was the controversial singlet pulled from the shelves of two Woolworths stores after accusations it was emblazoned with a 'racist' message.

But Palmer United Party Senator Jacqui Lambie has said the singlet's 'if you don't love it, leave' message did not go far enough.

'In my view, the message on the singlet didn't go far enough,' Ms Lambie told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday.  

'It should have read, "If you don't love it - leave - before we deport you."'

The singlet featured an image of the Australian flag and the text: 'If you don't love it, leave'

Outraged: Palmer United Party Senator Jacqui Lambie said 'What sort of weak-minded fool would think that a singlet, which shows a sign that reads, “If you don’t love it – leave” on an Australian flag background is racist?'

Fiery debate: 2GB talkback hosts Ray Hadley and Ben Fordham were critical of Woolworths' decision to pull the singlet

The outspoken senator is the latest conservative-leaning identity to criticise the supermarket's decision to withdraw the singlet from two of its stores this week - first revealed by Daily Mail Australia - after they were delivered 'in error'. 

Sydney talkback radio host Ray Hadley blasted the supermarket's move on Tuesday morning, telling his listeners: 'It (the singlet) is not racist, it's simply a fact of life.'

His colleague, 2GB afternoon host Ben Fordham, offered to give away 50 T-shirts bearing the slogan.

Senator Lambie, who drew fire earlier this week for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, referenced Islamic extremists in justifying her position.

'And if the Greens or any other weak-minded idiots think that’s politically incorrect or racist – at least my message isn’t as “racist” as the message which is being spread world-wide by the Islamic extremists and their mates in Australia - on blood soaked black flags which essentially reads: “If you don’t love it – you’re dead – because we’ll cut off your head",' she said in a statement. 

Ms Lambie also described people who believed the singlet was racist as 'weak minded fool(s)'. 

The controversy over the apparel began on Monday after a shopper noticed the singlet on sale at Woolworths' Cairns supermarket.  

'@woolworths, Cairns, selling racist singlets for everyday low prices!' the user tweeted.  

The post was shared by staff of Greens MP Adam Bandt on his Facebook page, who described the singlet as 'divisive and ridiculous'. 

Woolworths removed the items from stock immediately after the supermarket was made aware, a spokesman said.

'The singlet was not one we ordered,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was delivered to us in error and should never been allowed on our shelves.' 

Controversial: Senator Jacqui Lambie has waded into the debate surrounding the controversial singlet

Led the backlash: Adam Bandt and his staff criticised the 'if you don't like it, leave' singlet - and Woolworths withdrew the item from stock at two of its stores

The tweet that started it all: This social media post sparked a fierce backlash against Woolworths. Many customers pledged to boycott the company

The company's Facebook page was bombarded with comments critical of the supermarket stocking the singlet, with some shoppers even declaring they would boycott the store. 

One comment said: 'There's no way on earth I'm spending my weekly shopping budget at a supermarket who thinks it's fine to sell racism themed apparel.'

Another said: 'Get rid of the racist shirts and sack whoever thought it was a good idea.' 

Mr Bandt praised Woolworths' move in an interview with the Today Show.

'I think if you put yourself in the shoes of someone who is walking down the street and they see this T-shirt, it's not exactly sending a message of inclusion and welcome, is it?' he said.

Senator Lambie said a justification for her argument could be found in the nation's most important legal document.

'The constitution of Australia reflects the simple and powerful message contained in that singlet'. 

'Section 44 strictly prohibits anyone with divided loyalties to another country or any allegiances to a foreign power, from standing for Parliament.' 

'And that’s the underlying issue and important political question that our nation must have a mature discussion about i.e. Divided loyalties and foreign allegiances – Should Australia accept them?'

Neil Booth, the Sydney businessman whose company sold the singlets to Woolworths, told Daily Mail Australia only 'six to eight' of the singlets would have been distributed to the stores.

'What sort of weak-minded fool would think that a singlet, which shows a sign that reads, “If you don’t love it – leave” on an Australian flag background is racist?

The constitution of Australia reflects the simple and powerful message contained in that singlet. Section 44 strictly prohibits anyone with divided loyalties to another country or any allegiances to a foreign power, from standing for parliament.

And that’s the underlying issue and important political question that our nation must have a mature discussion about i.e. Divided loyalties and foreign allegiances – Should Australia accept them?

When anyone makes the decision to live in Australia – they must swear undying, undivided love, loyalty and allegiance to our democratic system of government, constitution and laws.

There are no exceptions. If Australia were allowed to follow the example of every other country in history where divided loyalties and foreign allegiances were allowed to exist, our Nation would split apart and be at war with itself.

And perhaps that’s what we’re experiencing now. If not overt, but certainly a covert war between people in Australia who love the free democratic country they live in without any reservations, divided loyalties or foreign allegiances -and those who want to impose their culture, beliefs and laws on the rest of us.

The only place for divided loyalties in Australia is in sport – maybe. But when it comes to the deadly serious issue of law, democratic system of government, flag and constitution – divided loyalties and allegiances to foreign powers should be strictly prohibited.

Anyone who displays or admits to a divided loyalty or an allegiance to a foreign power should be denied the right to vote and any right to taxpayer assistance.

In my view, the message on the singlet didn’t go far enough. It should have read, “If you don’t love it – leave – before we deport you.”

And if the Greens or any other weak-minded idiots think that’s politically incorrect or racist – at least my message isn’t as “racist” as the message which is being spread world-wide by the Islamic extremists and their mates in Australia - on blood soaked black flags which essentially reads:

“If you don’t love it – you’re dead – because we’ll cut off your head.”'
