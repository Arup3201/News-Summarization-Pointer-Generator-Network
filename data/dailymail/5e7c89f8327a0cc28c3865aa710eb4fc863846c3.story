Scotland Yard said today viewing the film showing James Foley's murder by an Islamic State (IS) extremist may be illegal - but experts believe any prosecutions for watching it would be 'absurd'.

The Met also urged people not to spread the gruesome video over social networks like Twitter and Facebook, warning they could be arrested.

The film shows Mr Foley, 40,  kneeling in a desert-like environment at an unknown location as an IS fighter stands by his side dressed in black and with his face covered. 

The killer, who is believed to be British, accused America of 'aggression towards the Islamic state' for its attacks on IS, before murdering Mr Foley.

Warning: Scotland Yard has said that viewing, downloading or spreading the IS video of James Foley's murder could be an offence, experts have said that this would be very difficult to prove

Scotland Yard, which leads counter-terror policing in the UK, confirmed that it is investigating the video and reminded social media users that spreading extremist material is a crime.

The force said: 'The Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command is investigating the contents of the video that was posted online in relation to the alleged murder of James Foley.

'We would like to remind the public that viewing, downloading or disseminating extremist material within the UK may constitute an offence under terrorism legislation.' 

Government sources today confirmed that David Cameron has seen a full version of the video following his return to Downing Street.  

The film has spread across the internet and has potentially already been seen in some form by millions but the police and CPS would find it difficult to prove an offence had taken place, an expert told MailOnline.

Human rights barrister Adam Wagner said: 'For disseminating a terrorist video to be an offence you would have to very clearly encourage the activity shown, for example to say that you think what the terrorists have done is excellent and encourage others to do the same. 

'But even then there is a defence if you can prove that the message did not represent your views, or was in fact sarcastic.

‘In theory if you had downloaded the video to your computer you could be in trouble, because possessing terrorist material is an offence regardless of your intent, similar to possessing child pornography. But streaming the film is unlikely to be an offence. You would have to be streaming it for the purposes of encouraging or committing terrorism.

‘But merely viewing it - it is difficult to see how that could engage even the very wide terrorism laws. There would also be no public interest in prosecuting a someone for viewing if they didn't intend to promote IS. It would be absurd. So for the Met to say that viewing a video in and of itself could constitute an offence seems to me to be far from reality’.

Appalling: The killing of James Foley has shocked the world but police and Twitter have taken steps to stop it spreading  

The footage appears to then show another captured journalist, Steven Sotloff, who went missing near the border of Syria and Turkey last year. His life depends on the US president's 'next decision', the IS fighter warns.

The film has not been verified but the journalist's family have accepted that it shows his death and Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the footage appears to be genuine.

Mr Foley's mother Diane released a statement saying: 'We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.

'We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages.'

Mr Cameron returned to No 10 just two days into his family holiday in Cornwall to lead the response, posting on Twitter: 'If true, the murder of James Foley is shocking and depraved. I will today chair meetings on the situation in Iraq/Syria.'
