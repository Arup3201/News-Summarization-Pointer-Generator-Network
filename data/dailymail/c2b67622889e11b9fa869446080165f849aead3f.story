A rare two-faced kitten, also known as a 'Janus' kitten, has been born in Oregon.

The birth of tiny Duecy made her owner Stephanie Durkee, from Amity, do a double-take when she was delivered.

Shortly afterwards, the newborn was rejected by its mother so Ms Durkee is feeding her by hand.

The kitten was examined by a vet and everything appears to be in good working order.

Ms Durkee said: 'The kids actually found 
them and came in and said, "mom there's a kitty with two heads," and I 
said, "I think you guys are just tired, you're crazy, that doesn't 
happen."'Â 

In February last year, a kitten born with two faces died after barely living to the age of just two days.

Nash
 Hand and Amelia Forsythe, of Port Charlotte, Florida, named him Harvey 
Dent after the character's Two-Face alter-ego in Batman.

But the little 
boy died from complications.
