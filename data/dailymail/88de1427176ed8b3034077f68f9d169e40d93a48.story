Cold comfort: Turning your washing down to 30c could allow germs to thrive

You may think you are doing your bit for the environment. But if you’re following the current trend of turning down the temperature on your washing machine to 30c, you could be doing yourself harm.

New research has shown that potentially dangerous bacteria in our laundry are not killed off in low-temperature washes. They breed in the machine, and are passed on to future loads.

Hygiene expert Dr Lisa Ackerley says: ‘Studies show that a build-up of bacteria in the interior of a washing machine transfers to the wash water of subsequent cycles — with as many as one million bacteria in just two tablespoons of water.

‘Low-temperature washing provides optimal conditions for germs to multiply.’

But manufacturers of washing machines and detergents are pestering us to lower temperatures to 30c, claiming it will save us money — and the planet.

So, is the cool wash just another eco-con? Is it putting your health at risk? And what temperature should you be washing your clothes at? We investigate . . .

WHY DOES HOT MEAN CLEAN? 

‘Higher temperatures clean clothes more hygienically because when the water is hot, the cotton yarns swell up and forcibly release the soiling,’ says laundry expert Dr Richard Neale. As for the current craze for a cool wash, he is emphatic: 30c cycles simply won’t clean your clothes properly.

‘In fact, 30c is actually the temperature in which we incubate bugs to grow them for our experiments,’ he explains. ‘Oily skin sebum — the yellow mark you see on shirt collars and underarms — is a protein and breeds bugs that most detergents won’t kill at such cool temperatures.

‘In order to clean polyester cottons thoroughly, they need to be washed at a minimum of 65c for ten minutes. For pure cottons it is 71c for three minutes, which kills pretty well all viable micro-organisms.

‘If you’re doing a normal family wash and no one has any infectious diseases, this doesn’t really matter. Your family all share germs anyway, and it’s unlikely you’ll get ill. But if one of the household works in, say, healthcare or the catering industry, it’s vital their work clothes are thoroughly cleaned.’

Germs that are passed on through 
minuscule spores — from the hospital superbug Clostridium difficile 
(C.diff) and the food-poisoning bug Bacillus cereus, which is found in 
products that have been left to sit around for too long, like rice, 
right up to the lethal anthrax bacterium — have a good survival rate in 
anything other than the hottest temperatures, says Dr Neale.

In a spin: Will the eco-friendly cool cycle come out clean in the wash?

‘Only autoclaving (high-pressurised cleaning with steam) at 150c for about ten minutes will kill these, which is why anthrax is such a feared bioterrorist weapon,’ he adds.

Meanwhile, Dr Ackerley points out the problem of cross-contamination if the wash-setting is not hot enough. ‘I am very concerned about bacteria from underwear transferring on to items such as tea towels which are then used to wipe dishes,’ she says.

So, does this mean that no washing powder will kill these germs?

‘Some products do incorporate a chemical disinfectant which can reduce the amount of bugs in the wash,’ says Dr Neale, ‘but they are rarely available domestically.

Ariel is among the very few brands that does one (Ariel Antibacterial+, £22.50, broschdirect.com). Otherwise you have to go to commercial laundry suppliers to get anything similar. If you have someone ill, elderly or with a low immune system at home, it might be wise to invest in an anti-bacterial detergent.’

If you’re not using an anti-bacterial detergent or a hot temperature, you are relying on simple dilution with water to disperse bugs, says Dr Neale. And this is ineffective.

‘With proper dilution, you can reduce the number of bugs from one million per square inch to around 10-20 per square inch, but in a normal washing process you don’t use nearly enough water. The only way to really kill germs is to wash at a higher temperature.’

JUST HOW MANY GERMS ARE IN YOUR MACHINE?

While a 30c cycle won’t technically damage your washing machine, it can lead to a build-up of grease or black mould on your machine door or inside the detergent drawer. And some estimates say the average washing machine contains 100 million E.coli bugs at any one time.

Dr Neale says: ‘Germs may be lurking in your machine if you only ever do cool washes. If you smell a rotting smell coming from your machine, you may want to think about doing a very hot wash — say, 90c — to sterilise it.’

Nature fresh? Biological washing powders are much better at killing germs in cooler washes

Consumer experts at Which? suggest doing at least one hot wash a month (60c minimum) and leaving the machine door ajar after every load to allow it, and the rubber seal around it, to dry out.

Removing and cleaning the detergent drawer, and wiping around the rubber seal with light bleach cleaners will also reduce the ability of germs to breed.

CAN YOU TRUST THE 60c SETTING?

By now, you’re probably reaching for the 60c button on your washing machine. Indeed, studies show that washing at 30c or even 40c kills just six per cent of house-dust mites, compared with 100 per cent at 60c.

But be warned: even the 60c setting may not kill germs properly. Why? Because some 60c settings simply don’t get that hot.

Yesterday, Which? found that eight out of 12 popular washing machines failed to reach the correct temperature on a 60c wash. And none of the machines — which included Hoover, Miele, Hotpoint and Zanussi models — kept the water hot enough for long enough to kill bugs such as MRSA or the housemites that cause allergic reactions.

In fact, one Hoover machine (the DYN8163D8P-80) only heated the water to 43c on its so-called 60c cycle. And most of the machines kept the water cooler than 50c for most of the wash programme.

So you may have to go even higher than the 60° programme to make sure your wash is properly hot.

WHICH DETERGENTS ARE BEST AT KILLING GERMS?

While hot washes are undoubtedly better than cool ones, there’s one thing they’re not good at: cleaning delicate fabrics.

Indeed, hot washes will destroy some fabrics such as silk, in which case an antibacterial additive needs to be put in the cooler wash.

Dr Ackerley says: ‘Dettol Disinfectant Liquid claims to kill 99.9 per cent of bacteria at low-temperature washes. And there’s Napisan, a treatment powder for cloth nappies, which I use with other items of clothing, not just nappies.’

Other products that claim to sanitise clothes include Eradicil, Milton Antibacterial Fabric Solution and Halo.

According to fabric technologist Mairwen Jones, biological powders work best at killing germs in  cooler washes.

Out to dry: The Energy Saving Trust says 'economical' cool washes will save you a total of just £13 per year

‘They contain enzymes not present in 
non-biological detergents that break down stain particles, making them 
easier to wash off. At temperatures above 60°, the enzymes are killed 
off and the detergent is  less effective.’

Mairwen
says it’s a myth that  sensitive skins should avoid biological 
detergents. ‘If your machine rinses clothes properly, all traces of 
detergent should be removed, and they should be safe to wear against all
skin-types.’

IS A QUICK RINSE ANY USE?

Many
modern machines have ‘quick wash’ cycles that clean clothes in as 
little as 15 minutes, and the temperature never rises above 30c.

Dr
Neale says: ‘A quick rinse is fine if the clothes are only very lightly
soiled with fresh perspiration. But this length of time and temperature
setting won’t swell the yarns of the cotton, so any significant soiling
will not be released.’

If you have a hot quick-wash cycle — 60c or above — it should kill most germs. So you can save time and be really clean.

DOES WASHING AT 30c SAVE YOU MONEY?

According to the Energy Saving Trust, the average washing machine is used for 274 cycles a year, using up to £63-worth of electricity, depending on the model.

Machine and detergent manufacturers are keen to claim that consumers can use around 40 per cent less energy if they choose cool washes. But are the savings worth it? Andy Trigg, an engineer who runs consumer website whitegoodshelp.co.uk, doesn’t think so.

‘Using 41 per cent less electricity by washing at 30c sounds impressive but, as always with percentage figures, you need some perspective to judge how useful they are. For example, 2p is 100 per cent more than 1p, but 1p is hardly astounding.’

He cites an example on a detergent advert that states: ‘At 30c, the average energy consumed per wash was 0.284 KWh, while at people’s normal wash temperatures, this was 0.482 KWh.’

Andy says: ‘This means the saving in electricity by washing at 30c was on average 0.198 KWh. The average cost of electricity is 10p for using 1,000 watts in an hour (KWh). This means you will have saved just under half — 5p. The 41   per cent saving is only on this 5p, which works out at about 2p per wash.’

According to the Energy Saving Trust, the annual saving of cool washes is just £13 a year per household. Andy admits: ‘Any saving is good, and small savings add up. But it is not going to save a fortune.’

And it’s certainly not going to kill off germs, either.
