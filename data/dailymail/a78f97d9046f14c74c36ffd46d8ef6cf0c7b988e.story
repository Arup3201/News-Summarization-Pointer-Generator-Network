The shockingly 
disfigured man, whose full-body tumours were lovingly kissed by the 
Pope, has been revealed as a 53-year-old Italian suffering from a rare 
genetic disease.

Vinicio Riva’s entire body has been ravaged by the growths, a symptom of neorofibramatosis, which is not contagious. He is pictured here.

Earlier
 this month his picture shot round the world, when he was emotionally 
embraced by Pope Francis, at one of the pontiff’s weekly audiences in 
Rome.

Act of kindness: Pope Francis (left) comforted Vinicio Riva, a 52-year-old Italian who had travelled to Rome for a audience in Saint Peter's Square in November

The severely disabled 
man, who is shunned in the street, and has induced horror even in his 
doctors, has for the first time described the encounter, saying that 
being caressed by Francis was like ‘being in Paradise’.

He told Italian news magazine Panorama he was left speechless when Pope did not hesitate to touch him.

He
 said: ‘His hands were so soft. And his smile was so clear and open. But
 the thing that struck me most is that there has not been thinking about
 whether or not to hug me. I'm not contagious, but he did not know. But 
he just did it: he caressed me all over my face, and as he did I felt 
only love.

He recollected 
the meeting of a fortnight ago: 'First I kissed his hand while he, with 
the other hand, caressed my head and wounds. Then he drew me to him in a
 strong embrace, kissing my face.

'My
 head was against his chest his arms were wrapped around me. It lasted 
just over a minute, but to me it seemed like an eternity.'

Mr
 Riva was accompanied to the Vatican's St Peter's square by his aunt, 
Caterina and his younger sister Morena, who also suffers from a lesser 
form of the disease.

The 
meeting with Francis marked a new beginning for him he said: ‘Later I 
turned to my aunt and told her: "Here I leave my pain"'.

Touching moment: The pontiff kissed Mr Riva, who suffers from a rare disease called neurofibromatosis, which is genetic and not contagious 

Mr Riva first
 needed medical attention at the age of two for the genetic condition, 
and has since endured numerous operations on his heart, throat and eyes.

But it was the growths, that first appeared at the age of 15, that destroyed his appearance.

Now
 his entire face and head are covered in growths, Panorama reported. 
Only his left cheek, warped as if burnt in a fire is free of the painful
 growths. His feet are deformed and devastated by the sores, which makes
 walking difficult.

He lives with his sister in the 
council house they share in a suburb of Vicenza, working part-time as 
handyman in a retirement home.

Their
 mother was afflicted by the same condition and eventually died of it. 
Mr Riva himself was only expected to live until the age of 30.

The
 severely sick man has been reviled in the street as an ‘Elephant Man’, 
with mothers crossing the street to avoid him, but those in his 
community have now come to love him.

He said: 'Those who I have known for a long time are kind; the others are horrible.’

He
 is taken to Lourdes, a popular place of pilgrimage in France, every 
year by Catholic group Unitalsi, but it was the first time they had 
thought to take him to St Peter’s.

Neurofibromatosis has long been associated with the 'Elephant Man,' the name given to Joseph Carey Merrick, who was severely disfigured. But evidence now suggests he was suffering from another rare syndrome

The man who met Pope Francis is believed to be suffering from a condition called neurofibromatosis – the name for a number of genetic conditions that cause swellings or lumps.

Although many people who have the condition inherit it from one of 
their parents, up to 50 per cent develop it randomly from a 
gene mutation before they are born.

There are two types of neurofibromatosis and this man is suffering from type one, Dr Anand Saggar, a London-based genetics expert, told MailOnline. 

Despite their alarming appearance, the growths and swellings - called neurofibromas and caused by a growth of cells - are not cancerous or contagious.

The condition has long been associated with the ‘Elephant Man,’ the name given to Joseph Carey Merrick, who was severely disfigured.

However, in 1986, a new theory emerged that Mr Merrick may actually have had Proteus syndrome, a condition which involves symptoms 
such as abnormal growth of the bones, skin and head.

The confusion was again compounded in 2001 when it was proposed that he had suffered from a combination of neurofibromatosis type one (NF1) and Proteus syndrome.

However, DNA tests on his hair and bones have proven inconclusive.

Other symptoms of neurofibromatosis type one include flat, light brown spots on the skin.

These harmless marks, also called cafe au lait spots, are common in many people. People who have more than six spots that are bigger than half a centimetre wide should get investigated for NF1. 

NF1 is a condition someone is born with, although some symptoms develop gradually over many years. The severity of the condition can vary considerably from person to person.

People with NH1 are more likely to suffer from learning difficulties and behavioural problems, a type of cancer known as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, which affect around 10 per cent of people with NF1 over their lifetime, vision problems, high blood pressure and a curved spine.
