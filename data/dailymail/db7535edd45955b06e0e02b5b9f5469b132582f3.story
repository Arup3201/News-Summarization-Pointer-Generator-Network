Team news

Newcastle

Summer signing Siem de Jong will be denied a competitive debut for Newcastle against Manchester City on Sunday by injury.

The Dutchman has failed to recover from the foot problem he picked up during pre-season, and will be joined on the sidelines by fellow midfielder Cheick Tiote, who is nursing a hamstring strain.

Striker Papiss Cisse is back in training after the knee injury he suffered towards the end of last season, but is still some way away from a return, while full-back Davide Santon (also knee) remains on the sidelines.

Provisional squad: Krul, Elliot, Janmaat, Haidara, Dummett, Coloccini, Williamson, S. Taylor, Yanga-Mbiwa, Anita, Colback, Cabella, Vuckic, Obertan, Riviere, Gouffran, Ferreyra, Perez, Armstrong.

Manchester City

Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero (groin) has not been ruled of Sunday's Barclays Premier League opener at Newcastle but new signing Eliaquim Mangala will not feature.

Defender Mangala only arrived at the club on Monday following his protracted £32million move from Porto.

This is the reverse of last season’s opening Premier League fixture when Newcastle United lost 0-4 at the Etihad Stadium.

The Citizens have won four and lost none of their last five opening weekend league fixtures, keeping four clean sheets in the process.

Newcastle have won just once in the last five seasons in their opening match (D2 L2).

The Magpies have failed to score in their last three Barclays Premier League clashes with Manchester City.

Man City full backs Aleksandar Kolarov (7) and Pablo Zabaleta (6) assisted more goals than any other defenders in the 2013-14 Premier League.

Fast starters: David Silva (centre) nodded Manchester City ahead in the sixth minute as they went on to crush Newcastle 4-0 in last season's opening game at the Etihad Stadium

Frank Lampard is the top scoring midfielder in Premier League history with 171 goals, as many as Aguero, Dzeko, Yaya Toure, David Silva and Vincent Kompany combined.

Despite winning only two of their opening eight away games last season, City still ended the campaign with 34 road points. Only Liverpool and Arsenal (35) gained more (Man Utd & Chelsea also collected 34).

Sergio Aguero scored 17 and assisted six goals in 23 appearances last season.

Newcastle lost 11 of their last 15 games in the 2013-14 Premier League yet still finished in the top half of the table.

City’s total of 102 goals last season in the Premier League is the second highest in the competition’s history (behind Chelsea with 103 in 2009-10).
