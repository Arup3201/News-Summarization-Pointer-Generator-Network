A chemistry lecturer has been jailed after plotting a Breaking Bad-style operation to produce £4million of amphetamine every two days. 

Ryszard Jakubczyk, 61, dubbed 'the Professor', planned to make the stimulant drug in a secret laboratory in Grantham, Lincolnshire.

He hoped to produce a staggering 88lbs of almost pure amphetamine every 48 hours - before supplying it to drug dealers across the country.

The drug - which induces effects of euphoria, alertness and increased energy - was among the highest grades of purity uncovered in the UK, according to investigators.

Jakubczyk, from Poland, was planning carry out the operation with the help of accomplices Piotr Turek, 35, Ernest Skorupa, 36, and Ewa Lyzwa-Cias, 60, Leeds Crown Court heard.

But the gang was caught after the National Crime Agency (NCA) put them under surveillance following a tip-off in August 2012.

Today, Dave Archer, of the NCA, described the plot as 'a real-life version of Breaking Bad'.

Scene: The amphetamine - which induces effects of euphoria and energy - was among the highest grades of purity uncovered in the UK, said investigators. Above, the Grantham house where the laboratory was uncovered

'This chemistry lecturer was going to use all of his skills to produce amphetamine on an industrial scale,' he said. 'We were able to shut down their operation and deny them access to huge profits.'

Breaking
 Bad tells the story of struggling chemistry teacher Walter 
White - also known as Heisenberg - who is diagnosed with inoperable lung
 cancer.

He uses his expertise to produce and sell
 the purest form of methamphetamine, or 'crystal meth', in a secret 
laboratory to secure his 
family's financial future before he dies.

Methamphetamine, a form of amphetamine sold in 'crystal' form, can be snorted, swallowed or injected by users. It is a Class A drug that is known for being extremely powerful and addictive.

Police swooped on Jakubczyk and his colleagues as they produced a test batch of amphetamine in the laboratory, which was hidden in the garden of the house in Grantham, the court heard.

They later discovered an underground bunker which had been used by the gang to store an array of dangerous chemicals.

Storage: Jakubczyk and his associates used these metal containers to store test batches of the powerful drug

Keeping it hidden: They also used these containers, pictured following the discovery, to store amphetamine

Jakubczyk, who trained in 
narcotics before becoming a university lecturer in Warsaw, was sentenced
 to nine years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracies to 
produce and supply amphetamine.

Meanwhile,
 Piotr Turek, 35, from Kilkenny in Ireland, who planned to distribute 
the drug across the UK, Ireland and Poland, was jailed for eight years.

And
 Ernest Skorupa, 36, and Ewa Lyzwa-Cias, 60, both from Grantham in 
Lincolnshire, were sentenced to seven and five years in prison 
respectively for their parts in the plot.

Meticulously planned: 'The Professor' was also helped by 36-year-old Ernest Skorupa (left). Right, a piece of equipment recovered from the laboratory by police
