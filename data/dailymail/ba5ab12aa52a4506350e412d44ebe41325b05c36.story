It is sometimes easy to forget that the Duchess of Cambridge wasn't born into royal life, such is the composure with which she fulfils her new role.

Her coolness yesterday, despite the turmoil going on around her, was truly remarkable.

It was around 8pm British time on Thursday that news broke of French magazine Closer's decision to publish topless pictures of Kate on holiday in Provence.

In Kuala Lumpur, where the Duke and Duchess were sleeping after a glittering royal banquet thrown in their honour, it was 3am.

The initial reaction from royal aides at St James's Palace was cautious. Could the magazine be bluffing to beef up its readership? Were the pictures even real?

When William and Kate rose around 6am in their suite at the High Commissioner's residence, it was up to their private secretary, former SAS officer Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton (backed up by Kate's Girl Friday, Rebecca Deacon, and their press secretary Miguel Head) to break the distressing news over breakfast of coffee and fresh fruit.

The couple were shocked, horrified even, but remarkably calm. They agreed with their private office's suggestion to wait and see what the magazine had actually done.

Even at this early stage, however, the similarities to the life of his late mother were almost too much to bear for William. 'This incident turns the clock back 15 years,' said a source close to the future king.

Following the initial discussions there was little time for the royal party to dwell on the pictures.

This was one of the busiest days of their nine-day tour on behalf of the Queen, with a visit to the As Syakirin Mosque in the centre of the Malaysian capital. They had obligations to fulfil.

Looking eerily reminiscent of her husband's late mother, whom she has always spoken regretfully of never having had a chance to meet, the Duchess stepped out of her official car dressed in a pale grey dress and matching scarf by ethical label Belulah, run by the couple's great friend Lady Natasha Rufus Issacs.

There was time for a giggle together as the royal couple sat down on chairs to remove their shoes

There was even time for a laugh and giggle together as the royal couple sat down on chairs to remove their shoes, William struggling with his hand-made brogues as Kate kicked off her favourite LK Bennett nude heels and sat waiting in her stockinged feet.

It was the first time that either of them had visited a mosque and they appeared genuinely interested in what they were being shown. Kate even let slip that her father-in-law, Prince Charles, who takes a particular interest in the Islamic faith, had given then something of a crash course.

Behind the scenes, however, talks were already beginning between London and Paris as to how to tackle the scandal best.

By the time the couple made their way to their next appointment, viewing a colourful cultural display at a nearby park to the cheers and screams of thousands of well-wishers, it was becoming clear the pictures did indeed appear to be genuine.

Yet still Kate remained calm. Having by now shed her veil – displaying an intricate bun dotted with pearl-headed pins – she threw her head back and plunged into the crowds, shaking hands, exchanging pleasantries and accepting flowers.

And she failed to bat even an eyelid when, as they left, an overenthusiastic fan lunged in through the open door of their car to take a picture before being dragged off and handcuffed by police.

Even when the pair went on to a business lunch, where William gave a speech, they appeared to be a couple without a care in the world.

It was only in the privacy of their suite, as they changed afterwards in preparation for their fourth engagement of the day, that Kate's composure momentarily crumbled as she was shown the pictures that had by now hit the streets of Paris.

William was said to be equally shaken. The intrusion quickly brought home the worst excesses of the paparazzi when his mother was alive. The Prince has done everything in his power to protect Kate from the same form of scrutiny and he quickly instructed his spokesman to make clear that their initial sadness had turned to anger and disbelief.

'We believe a red line has been crossed and we are consulting with French lawyers to see what, if any, action can be taken,' the aide said.

With the support of his wife, father and the Queen William issued a statement condemning the photographer and magazine's 'grotesque and totally unjustifiable' invasion of their privacy

Keen not to disappoint their hosts, the couple went on to their next engagement, a tea party at the British High Commission where among the celebrated guests were Malaysian-born shoe designer Jimmy Choo, who waxed lyrical about the Duchess's beauty 'both inside and out'.

Dressed in an ice blue lace dress by Alice Temperley, Kate's performance was as engaging as ever. In fact it was William – glowering every time he saw a photographer and constantly chewing his lip – who appeared to be feeling the strain.

Within minutes of their departure he instructed his press team – with the support of his wife, father and the Queen – to issue a statement condemning the photographer and magazine's 'grotesque and totally unjustifiable' invasion of their privacy and indicating they would leave no stone unturned in seeking redress.

Yet again, however, Kate's composure still shone through.

She offered a small smile to waiting newsmen and, as the couple boarded their Boeing 737-800 jet, she reassuringly placed her hand on the small of her husband's back.
