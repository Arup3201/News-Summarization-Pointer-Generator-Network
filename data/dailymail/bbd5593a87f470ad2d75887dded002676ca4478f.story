Jo Pavey, a 40-year-old mother-of-two, won Commonwealth bronze in the 5,000m, 17 years after competing in her first major championships.

It was a gutsy piece of distance running from an Englishwoman who simply refused to bow down to the might of Kenyan distance running, or to be limited by the supposed barriers of age.

‘Best race of the Games for me,’ was former 10,000m world champion Liz McColgan’s verdict - and she should know, after all.

Delighted: Jo Pavey took Commonwealth Games bronze in the 5,000 metres at Hampden Park on Saturday

Put your hands up! Kenyan Mercy Cherono clinched the gold as Pavey strode home for third

Mercy Cherono, 23, maintained Kenya’s record of winning every women’s distance event in Glasgow with her time of 15mins 7.21secs, but it was Pavey who produced the most remarkable display to win bronze, just 10 months after giving birth to her second child, Emily.

Pavey said: ‘It feels a bit surreal real, to be honest. I tried to think: “Just don’t regret this.”

‘It’s so easy to think: “Oh, they are Kenyans, they are so good.” I thought no, keep focusing and just tried to beat them.

‘It’s really special to think my little boy is watching me. We debated whether to bring my little girl but I really worried she’d be terrified as she is only 10 months old.

‘It’s really special to think that I am 40, a mum with two children.’

Hard yards! The 40-year-old showed a breathtaking turn of pace on the home straight 

Pavey was one of two 40-year-old English athletes in the field alongside Helen Clitheroe, competing in her fifth consecutive Commonwealth Games, who finished 11th.

The third English competitor, European junior cross-country champion Emelia Gorecka, who finished eighth, would only have been three years old when Pavey reached the 1500m semi-finals at the 1997 World Championships - the same age as Pavey’s son Jacob, who was watching at Hampden Park last night.

His mother spoiled the anticipated Kenyan 1-2-3 by sprinting past Margaret Muriuki in the home straight and nearly catching Janet Kisa, who finished second.

It was the least Pavey deserved for pushed on with 1200m remaining as she attempted to run the sting out of the Kenyan trio, and going again at the bell.

It had looked like a brave fourth place was beckoning when she was passed with 200m to go, but Pavey gritted her teeth and produced another spurt coming off the final bend to win Commonwealth bronze.
