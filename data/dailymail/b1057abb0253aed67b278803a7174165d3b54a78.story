The bushfires that tore across the Adelaide Hills over the last six days have been declared 95 per cent contained as satellite images of the heavy destruction emerge.

NASA released a photo captured by a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on their Terra satellite on only the second day of the ongoing disaster, which shows thick smoke billowing out across the fire's path.

Meanwhile, Geoscience Australia also shared a satellite image, captured on January 4, which showed both the active fire front at the time and what they dubbed as the 'fire scar' that the inferno left across the Adelaide Hills.

Up to 600 firefighters worked to battle 40 degree temperatures and 30 kilometre per hour winds on Wednesday, in an effort to take control of the raging bushfires.

Country Fire Service chief officer Greg Nettleton confirmed that 95 per cent of the fire has been contained by Wednesday afternoon, with only two ‘hotspot’ areas of concern remaining.

He also announced that interstate firefighters were heading home as the declaration of major emergency for the area had been rescinded.

It comes as thunderstorms roll into the area, bringing in winds of up to 120 km/h. 

However Mr Nettleton said that the rain was likely to aid firefighters, adding that the only concern was that strong wind gusts could cause new fires, initiated by lightning, to spread.

Kevin Knight, the Mayor of Tea Tree Gully which was hit by the raging bushfires, praised the efforts of volunteers and firefighters amidst the unpredictable conditions.

'The fires could have been so much worse. 38 houses lost sounds bad but it could have been 238 if the blaze had gone south,' Mr Knight told Daily Mail Australia.

'The firefighters have been unbelievable, but the weather conditions today are already very oppressive. Who can predict what will happen, anything could go wrong in this hot dry weather,' he said earlier on Wednesday.

'We have white collar, blue collar people, housewives, all fighting. They put on that CFS uniform and become superheroes.'

Mr Knight, who has also been heading up the Golden Grove Recreation Centre's relief centre, said he believed the last week of bushfires to be worse than those that devastated the state on Ash Wednesday in 1983.

'I'm old enough to remember the bad bushfires in the 1980's, but I've been on council for 17 years and this is the worse one I've seen,' he said.

'The sheer area of the fire, 230 kilometers is so hard to control… It's just total devastation at the moment.' 

Wednesday saw the biggest firefighting effort since the fire began on Friday afternoon, with a total of 31 aircraft and 110 trucks on the ground.

Over 12,500 hectares of land has been destroyed or damaged in the blaze so far, including 32 homes, 125 other buildings and four businesses. The results of another damage assessment is expected to be carried out before 5pm.

As of Wednesday morning, over $13 million worth of insurance claims had been lodged by vicitms. 

In a press conference on Tuesday, South Australian premiere Jay Weatherill confirmed that 134 people had been injured in the bushfires, including one person being treated for exhaustion and another individual who was hospitalised after being hit by a fallen tree.

The majority of those injured suffered smoke inhalation and dehydration, the Guardian reports.

Police on Monday said the cause of the bushfire was still unclear but that an incinerator near Sampson Flat in the Mount Lofty Ranges was one line of inquiry that was being investigated.

As the fires continue to rage, police arrested two male teenagers for allegedly starting a fire at Modbury on Friday night - 30 kilometres from where fire crews are battling blazes.

No damage was caused in the incident, but both boys have been bailed to appear in the Adelaide Youth Court on February 6.
