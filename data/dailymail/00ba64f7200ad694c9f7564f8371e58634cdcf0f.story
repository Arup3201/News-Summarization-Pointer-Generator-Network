Salvage experts believe that the AirAsia jet which crashed into the sea with 162 people on board exploded on impact.  

Suryadi Supriyadi, a director with the Indonesian national search and rescue agency, suggested initial analysis of the wreckage showed that the aircraft shattered because the cabin had not depressurised when it slammed into the water, Sky reported.

Mr Supriyadi said: 'The cabin was pressurised and before the pressure of the cabin could be adjusted, it went down - boom. That explosion was heard in the area.'

A team of navy divers earlier on Monday retrieved the flight data recorder from the wreckage. Divers have also found the second black box, but they have not yet been able to free it from debris on the floor of the Java Sea.

Associated Press reported that Mr Supriyadi confirmed the cockpit voice recorder was located on Monday just hours after officials announced that the other black box - the data flight recorder - had been brought to the surface.

He said the second black box was stuck under heavy wreckage, and divers are now working to lift it. 

The flight recorder monitors data such as airspeed and the aircraft's heading, while the cockpit voice recorder stores radio transmissions and sounds from within the cockpit.

Sky's Beijing Correspondent Mark Stone said: 'Experts will be looking at data which recorded the performance of the engines or other instrument in the cockpit. All of that will be taken to Jakarta and analysed in great detail.

'The conversations the crew had with ground control units in Singapore and Indonesia are already known, but they do not know what conversations took place on the flight deck.

'They know there was no Mayday issued and the cockpit recorder, when it is found, could reveal why.'

Searchers began zeroing in on the sites a day earlier after three Indonesian ships picked up intense pings from the area. The flight data recorder was brought to the surface by four divers early on Monday morning. 

The cockpit voice and flight data recorders are vital to understanding what brought Flight 8501 down on December 28, killing all 162 people on board. 

Officials said last week when the recorders were found they would be taken to Jakarta for analysis. 

It could take up to two weeks to download data, investigators said, although the information could be accessed in as little as two days if the devices are not badly damaged. 

The news comes after the tail section of the AirAsia aircraft was pulled from the sea off the coast of central Borneo on Saturday.

A photograph emerged on Sunday of an AirAsia search team member appearing to be pose in front of the downed jet's tail.

Indonesia AirAsia Flight QZ8501 lost contact with air traffic control in bad weather on December 28, less than halfway into a two-hour flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore. 

None of the 162 people on the aircraft survived. So far 48 bodies have been recovered from the site, including at least two still strapped into their seats.  

Many of the other passengers are believed to be inside the wreckage of the plane's main cabin, which has not been located, due to strong currents moving debris around.

At two weeks, most corpses will sink, said Anton Castilani, head of Indonesia's disaster identification victim unit, and there are already signs of serious decomposition.

'Divers have reached the tail part but ... the visibility was below one metre so they only managed to retrieve various debris,' said Bambang Soelistyo, chief of Indonesia's search and rescue agency.

'Now we are waiting for the speed of the current to ease. If it gets calmer later, they will go back to do another dive to determine whether the black boxes remained in the tail or were detached,' Mr Soelistyo said.

Mr Marsma Supriyadi, operations coordinator for the National Search and Rescue Agency said earlier on Sunday a sonar scan had revealed an object measuring 10 metres by four metres by 2.5 metres on the sea floor.

'They suspect it is the body of the plane. There is a big possibility that the black box is near the body of the plane,' Mr Supriyadi said in the town of Pangkalan Bun, the base for the search effort on Borneo.

'If it is the body of the plane then we will first evacuate the victims. Secondly we will search for the black box.' 

Families of the victims whose bodies have been recovered held funeral ceremonies to lay their loved ones to rest.

Family members and friends buried their bodies and lay flowers over the graves, bringing photos of the victims to lay at memorial sites.  

The recovery operation comes as news that the families of the victims of the flight will be offered $US100,000 in compensation by the airline.

An offer of $US24,000 was presented to family members, who were given a draft letter from AirAsia, which detailed its initial compensation deal, CNN reported.

Family members have been left confused about the letter's wording and raising issue with the airline approaching families separately in relation to compensation, the Wall Street Journal reported.

But Indonesia AirAsia's director of safety and security defended the isolated discussions to The Strait Times on Tuesday, saying: 'We respect that [some] families are still hoping to see that their relatives survived, so we offered [compensation first] to those whose family members have been identified'.

Captain Raden Achmad Sadikin added the airlines would be compensating families in line with Indonesian policy.

According to the regulatory body that is responsible for Indonesia's finance sector, agencies that insure airlines were liable to give 1.25 billion rupiah for every one of the 155 passengers including 315 million rupiah to 750 million rupiah for the 25 passengers who bought flight insurance.

Just before losing contact, the pilot told air traffic control he was approaching threatening clouds, but was denied permission to climb to a higher altitude because of heavy air traffic. No distress signal was issued. 

Indonesian aviation authorities have denied officials took bribes to allow airlines to alter their flight schedules amid allegations some were paid to approve unscheduled take-offs, including that of crashed AirAsia flight QZ8501.

AirNav Indonesia, the country's navigation operator, says its employees are clean and there is 'no big money' involved in relation to airlines altering unapproved flight schedules, The Straits Times reports.

Seven officials, including three from AirNav Indonesia, have now been suspended over suspected links to unapproved schedules, including AirAsia's fatal flight from Surabaya, Indonesia to Singapore on Sunday, December 28. 

AirAsia Flight QZ8501 only has approval to fly the Surabaya-Singapore route on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. 

It did not have approval to fly the route on Sundays, which is when the flight crashed after losing contact with traffic controllers over the Java Sea.

The seven people suspended in the wake of the plane crash include two from the transport ministry, two from Surabaya's international airport operator PT Angkasa Pura I, and three from AirNav Indonesia. 

Separately on Sunday, a DHC-6 Twin Otter operated by Indonesia's Trigana Air crashed on landing at Enarotali Airport in Paniai, Papua.

Strong winds caused the aircraft to roll over, domestic news website Detik.com reported, with no injuries to the three crew members on board. 

The plane was not carrying any passengers.

An Indonesian transport safety investigator told Reuters on Monday that there was no evidence to support the theory that the AirAsia airliner exploded before hitting water two weeks ago.

'There is no data to support that kind of theory,' said Santoso Sayogo, an investigator at the National Transportation Safety Committee.

Suryadi Supriyadi, operations coordinator at the National Search and Rescue Agency, earlier told reporters that the wreckage indicated the jet 'experienced an explosion' before impact due to a significant change in air pressure.
