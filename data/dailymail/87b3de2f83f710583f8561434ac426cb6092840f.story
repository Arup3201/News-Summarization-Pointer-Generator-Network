Millionaire hotel owner Andrew Davies 
who claimed his wife Debra was 'no more than a receptionist' today lost 
his Appeal Court bid to cut her £2.7million divorce settlement.

The 49-year-old owner of the £6million 
Cardiff Hotel, which overlooks exclusive Norfolk Square, in Bayswater, west London, claimed he was the driving force behind the business.

After love turned to hate in their 
relationship he described his 39-year-old wife as merely a paid employee
and only 'the second best receptionist he had had.'

Lord Justice Thorpe sitting with Lord 
Justices Elias and Rimer, said the hotel, described as the 'third party'
in the marriage, had been started by the husband's grandfather back 
in 1958 and passed into his sole control in 1997.

Australian-born Mrs Davies claimed: 
'The status of the hotel had risen almost dramatically as a result of 
her energy, enterprise and marketing skills.'

She claimed she worked up to 17 hours a
day transforming the 60 bed hotel and was entitled to a 'fair share' of
the family assets.

In the High Court in September last 
year, Judge Martin O'Dwyer agreed and gave her a £2.2million lump sum and the 
keys to the the £550,000 former matrimonial home in Acton, west London.

Lord Justice Thorpe said payouts in 'big money' divorces should be consigned to history

Mr Davies, said to be 'in love' with 
the hotel claimed it should have been taken out of the family assets, 
which also included gold bullion worth almost £1.8million, because she was in 
effect a member of staff who 'simply did her duties'.

But Judge O'Dwyer ruled that the two 
of them had worked 'ceaselessly' together to transform a 'dowdy and 
unwelcoming' hotel for working men into the tourist trade magnet it was 
today.

He said Mr Davies was 'overcome with 
bitterness' and 'much of his evidence was designed to belittle his ex 
wife and their relationship'.

He added : 'There is a third party in 
the relationship - the Cardiff Hotel. Mr Davies was burning to make the 
hotel work. He was in love with the hotel.

'His characterisation of his wife was as a good employee. He said she had been the second best receptionist he had had.'

The couple married in 2005 and had two children before finally splitting in 2009.

Judge O'Dwyer said the businessman had
been 'head over heels' in love with his wife. But no longer had any 
real acknowledgment of her commitment to him.

Lord Justice Thorpe said there were no
grounds for interfering with the judge's reasoning and anything less to
the wife would be 'plainly unfair.'
