A baby almost died after he was scalded by a drop of hot tea.

Alexander Caven-Atack, was just 10-months-old when he developed a bacterial infection from the injury, which was no bigger than a 10p coin.

He had to have 80 per cent of his top layer of skin removed with a scalpel and spent almost a fortnight in hospital.

Recovered: Alexander Caven-Atack after his ordeal with his father Andrew, 60

The scald was treated by doctors at Colchester General Hospital’s accident and emergency department but the infection was missed. Five days later his skin was blistering and peeling off on his back, arms and face.

He was rushed to the burns unit at Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford, where surgeons removed the infected skin during six operations. His parents were told their baby may not survive the procedure. 

Alexander has now made a full recovery and his father Andrew, 60, and mother Sarah, 40, are warning that even minor burns can lead to the potentially fatal Scalded Skin Syndrome.

Andrew, from Colchester, Essex, said: 'A consultant at Broomfield told me after how lucky Alexander had been to survive.

'If it had have been identified earlier it could have been treated with a course of antibiotics and creams. '

At it was, doctors wrapped Alexander in an anti-septic suit to recover.

'He was bandaged and we were presented with this little mummy with just his thumbs and one big toe showing,' Mr Caven-Atack, a music publisher, said. 

'He spent two weeks in intensive care and had antibiotics administered intravenously.

'He was fed by tube. Our normally smiley baby did not smile once in two weeks.'

Alexander received the 10p piece-sized burn when he grabbed his father's cup of tea as they sat in the garden on September 3 last year.

'It tipped over him and over his bare legs,' Mr Caven-Atack said.

'I ran with him to the kitchen and took his clothes off straight away.'

The burn triggered the extremely rare Scalded Skin Syndrome, an infection caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus Aureus, and the youngster needed 13 days of hospital treatment.

Mr Caven-Atack said: 'We want to use his ordeal to enure the next child doesn't go through what he went through. He really could have died.'

Ross Carroll, whose charity 
Prevention Town heads up a hot drink awareness campaign said: 'The child
would have died if he had not got to the burns unit.

'It is really alarming it wasn’t diagnosed before.'

A spokesman for Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust said: 'If Mr Caven-Atack has concerns about any aspects of his son’s care at our A&E department, we would encourage him to contact us as soon as possible so that we can investigate.

'Our dermatology department has no knowledge of any protocol that has been developed by the family’s GP but we would be interested to hear from this particular doctor.'

Creffield Road surgery in Colchester, 
which initially treated Alexander promised to make extra checks on scalded 
infants under the age of five.

According to the NHS 180 children are scalded by hot drinks every day.

Mrs Faye Holdsworth from Colchester is leading an awareness campaign of the dangers after her six-month old daughter Georgia-May was left scarred when a tray of drinks toppled on to her.

'I would urge parents to think all the time about the dangers of hot 
drinks,' she said.

'Be aware and keep toys out of the kitchen. Now when I see mums 
handling coffees and their babies, I feel physically sick.'
