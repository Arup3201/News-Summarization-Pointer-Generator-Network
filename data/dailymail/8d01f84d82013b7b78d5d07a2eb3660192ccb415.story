Tourists are being blamed for the rise in dingo attacks on a Queensland island with photos of people taking selfies with the wild dogs rife on social media.

Residents of Fraser Island, north of the Sunshine Coast, have called for tougher penalties for people who interact and try to feed dingoes following an attack on a man this week.

Dane Allan, 25, suffered injuries to his head, legs and buttocks when he was attacked by three dingoes while on the beach at 10.30pm on Monday.

Tourists are being blamed for the rise in dingo attacks on a Queensland island with photos of people taking selfies with the wild dogs rife on social media

Since 2001 there have been 986 reports about problems with dingoes, with 149 incidents considered 'high risk', which includes biting

The recent attack on the World Heritage sand island has residents accusing tourists and fisherman of encouraging the dingoes to act aggressively.

A number of tourists have posted their selfies with dingoes in the background on social media and some are dangerously close to the wild dogs despite warnings around the island.

Sailfish on Fraser hotel manager Julie Dunn, who was one of the first to respond when Mr Allan was attacked on Monday, has called for increased fines for those who interact with the animals.

A staff member from Fraser Island Retreat, Larry Ray, said the island would have dingo problems as long as people fed them

'I think $300 is not enough. I think it should be increased to $5000,' she told the Courier Mail.

'The thing is people donâ€™t understand the dingoes they come here to see. They are wild animals.

'Do people go to Africa to see the wild animals and try to feed them?'

A staff member from Fraser Island Retreat, Larry Ray, said the island would have dingo problems as long as people fed them.

'The dogs that are causing the problems are caused by people interacting with them,' he said.

'I love the dogs and I get annoyed when this (attacks) happens because somewhere along the line it was humans causing the stupidity.'

Tourists continue to pose with dingoes and feed them despite several warning posted around the island
