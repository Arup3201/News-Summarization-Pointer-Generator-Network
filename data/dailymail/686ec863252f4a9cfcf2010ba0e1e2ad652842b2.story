Two Honolulu city councilmen have dropped their proposal to rename a beach after Barack Obama – marking the second time officials in the president's home state have balked on honoring him with his name on a stretch of sand and surf.

It was a series of complaints from the public that drove Councilman Stanley Chang and Council Chairman Ernie Martin to withdraw their plan, which would have changed the name of Sandy Beach Park to President Barack Obama Sandy Beach Park.

'We've heard a number of concerns from members of the community,' a diplomatic Chang told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. 

'Given the facts we received, we don't think it's necessary to move forward,' he said.

Paradise: Sandy Beach near Honolulu will not be renamed after Obama, following 'concerns' leveled byHawan

He left his pen and phone on the beach: Obama sampled the waves at Sandy Beach in 2008

The beach is a popular bodysurfing spot on Oahu's east side. The Associated Press reports that it was a favorite for the president as he grew up.

Cameras caught the future Oval Office occupant riding waves there while he vacationed during his first presidential campaign in 2008.

In remembrance of that event, the city council approved funding this year for a 'plaque dedicated to President Barack Obama's love of bodysurfing at Sandy Beach Park.'

But on the issue of renaming the entire site, Martin said in a statement that he heard concerns from the community about the historic nature of the beach and cultural sensitivities associated with renaming age-old locations that date back centuries. 

But he added that there may be other public facilities more appropriate to honor the president.

It's not clear whether substituting one of them would kill the $500,000 in renovation and beautification funding slated to accompany a beach name-change.

Hawaiians were split this week in interviews with KHON-TV2. 

'I don’t think it’s fair because, personally, he’s done nothing for our beach over here,' Waimanalo resident Kanaloa Kane told the TV station.

'Maybe he did grow up here, but as a local, I've been surfing here for 10 years easy and I don’t think it’s fair.'

But Beth Amann, another frequent Sandy Beach visitor, thought the money would help keep the beach spiffy.

'I think it’s definitely going to help for sure,' she said. 'That way, they’re going to keep things more picked up probably, more improvements' 

So far Obama's name hasn't been applied to any public buildings, sites or facilities in the state of Hawaii. Current law prohibits renaming such places for anyone who is still alive. 

In 2009 the council debated a bill that would have added a loophole for 'a president of the United States born in Hawaii.'

Councilmen and women who wanted to honor other famous Hawaiians shot it down, however, complaining that it was too narrow.

The idea back then was to rename Aina Moana Beach Park, which locals refer to as Magic Island. The new name would have been President Barack Obama Beach Park at Magic Island. 

Swamped, but not by Republicans in Congress: Obama won't see his name on the beach's main sign, but a plaque already commemorates his love of bodysurfing there

Todd Apo, who was chairman of the Honolulu City Council in 2009, told Travel Weekly then that his constituents would rather have named the park after then-Sen. Daniel Inouye.

'I think everyone appreciates the important connection between our current president and our state,' Apo said. 'But people have raised the point that someone like Senator Inouye has done a huge amount for our state over his extensive term in office, yet there's no exception for him. So where do you draw the line?'

Some politicians on the panel complained that no one who spoke for the Native Hawaiian community had been consulted.

The name Aina Moana means 'land of the sea' in Hawaii's native language. Activists often object to measures that dilute the presence of native names, artwork and customs in the state, which joined the U.S. only 55 years ago.

None of the beach name-wrangling in Hawaii is related, however, to a momentary renaming of a famous French beach for the U.S. president in 2009 by then-UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

During a remembrance ceremony marking the 65th anniversary of the D-Day invasion at Normandy, Brown referred to Omaha Beach as 'Obama Beach.'
