The Conservatives were today accused by Labour of 'getting excuses in early' by issuing warnings about the global economy to explain grim news about the levels of government borrowing.

Chancellor George Osborne said Britain is not 'immune' to a global economic slowdown while David Cameron said red warning lights' were 'flashing on the dashboard of the global economy'.

But Labour leader Ed Miliband said the government needed to stop 'blaming everybody else' for failures in cutting the deficit.

With two weeks until Mr Osborne delivers his Autumn Statement, there are fears low tax revenues and higher borrowing will make it difficult for him to offer any respite for hard-pressed families ahead of the election.

Tory MPs hoped Mr Osborne would use his statement on December 3 to offer upbeat news on the economy, and promise tax cuts after the election.

But today the Chancellor told reporters: 'You have to make a realistic assessment of the global economy today.

'We've discovered that Japan has gone into recession, Europe remains vey weak, and although the British economy is perfoming well we're not immune to these things happening in the world. 

'It's all the more reason why we've got to go on working through our long term economic plan and why it would be a complete disaster to divert from that plan, to borrow and spend more. That would put Britain in a place where many other countries find themselves today.' 

It came after Mr Cameron said that six years on from the financial crisis of 2008, it was more important than ever to maintain a firm hand on the country's finances.

He wrote: 'Six years on from the financial crash that brought the world to its knees, red warning lights are once again flashing on the dashboard of the global economy.

'The eurozone is teetering on the brink of a possible third recession. Emerging markets, which were the driver of growth in the early stages of the recovery, are now slowing down.'

In the Commons, Mr Miliband claimed the government had switched from the previous view that problems in the British economy were all to do with the government and not international factors.

He told the PM: 'Today you tell us there are red lights flashing in the global economy. I think that is what is known as getting your excuses in early.

'You used to tell us that the problems in the British economy were all to do with the British government and nothing to do with international factors.

'Now, you want to tell us that on your watch they're all to do with international factors and nothing to do with the British government.

'You have gone from saying everything is fixed thanks to you, to everything is not fixed but is nothing to do with you.

'All along you should have been listening to the British people who see deep problems in an economy not working for them. Isn't it time you stopped blaming everybody else for an economy that's great for a few people at the top but isn't delivering for most working people?'

At next May's election, voters would have a choice between the Conservatives, who would ensure the recovery continued by taking tough action, and Labour, who could see it stall by offering 'easy answers'.

Mr Cameron's warning follows a claim by Bank of England governor Mark Carney that a 'spectre' of economic stagnation was haunting Europe. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has also expressed fears that a diet of high debt, low growth and unemployment may yet become 'the new normal in Europe'.

In an article in the Guardian, Mr Cameron said global instability such as the continued eurozone problems and the ebola outbreak threatened Britain's recovery. 

He wrote: 'In six months' time, Britain will face a choice: the long-term plan that has seen it prosper, or the easy answers that would surely have seen it fail.

'By sticking to our long-term plan at home and standing up for Britain's interests abroad, we will do everything possible to protect our economy and give hardworking families a secure future in a Britain they are proud to call home.'

Vladimir Putin stormed out of the G20 summit in Australia yesterday after being branded a liar by a fellow leader.

The Russian president was taken to task over his country's support for rebels in Ukraine by Canada's prime minister, Stephen Harper, when the pair met for the traditional summit photo.

'I guess I'll shake your hand, but I have only one thing to say to you: you need to get out of Ukraine,' Mr Harper told Mr Putin, according to a source in the Canadian's office. 'I'm not in Ukraine,' Mr Putin replied. To which Mr Harper countered: 'That's why I don't want a meeting with you. You'll just lie to me.'

Mr Putin flew home before the summit's closing lunch.

Mr Cameron's article comes as he flew back from the G20 summit in Brisbane at which the state of the international economy was the main topic.  

He said ebola, conflict in the Middle East and Russia's 'illegal actions' in Ukraine all added a 'dangerous backdrop of instability and uncertainty'.

Despite this, the British economy was growing. 'But in our interconnected world, wider problems in the global economy pose a real risk to our recovery at home. We cannot insulate ourselves completely, but we must do all we can to protect ourselves from a global downturn.'

Mr Cameron said that when the credit crunch happened Labour offered easy answers, 'thinking we could spend, borrow and tax our way to prosperity'.

He warned: 'Those were the wrong answers then; they are the wrong answers now.'

But Labour highlighted comments by former prime minister Sir John Major, who told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show that people were 'concerned and worried' that 'none of the growth in the economy has yet reached wage packets or salary slips'. 

Shadow Treasury chief secretary Chris Leslie said: 'David Cameron claims his policies are working, but as even Sir John Major admits, most people still aren't feeling the recovery.

'Working people are £1,600 a year worse off under his Government, borrowing is going up so far this year and exports have fallen behind our competitors.

'David Cameron should be trying to strengthen growth and make sure working people finally benefit from it, not making excuses for slower growth.

'Only Labour's economic plan will deliver a recovery for the many, not just a few at the top. And we'll balance the books, but do so in a fairer way by reversing David Cameron's tax cut for millionaires.'
