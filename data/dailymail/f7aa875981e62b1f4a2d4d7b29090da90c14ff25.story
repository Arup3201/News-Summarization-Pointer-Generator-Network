With its beautiful parks, enviable healthcare and location next to one of the world's best coastal drives, it's little wonder people want to live in Melbourne.

While it may not necessarily have the glamorous appeal of Sydney, Australia's second city has been ranked the world's most liveable city for the third year running.

Home to almost 4.25million people, it beat Austrian capital Vienna into second place, with Vancouver in Canada ranking third.

Top spot: Melbourne was lauded in every category from healthcare to education in the rankings which saw it crowned number one place to live in the world for the third year running

Australia dominates the ranking with four cities - Melbourne, Adelaide, Sydney and Perth - in the top ten, with Canadian cities accounting for three of the others.

Despite its popularity with tourists however, London is nowhere to be seen.

The rankings were compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit which explains that the destinations that score highest are 'mid-sized cities in wealthier countries with a relatively low population density.'

The ratings take into account: stability, worked out by looking at crime rates and civil unrest; quality of healthcare; culture and environment; education and infrastructure.

Each city was given an overall score out of 100 based on its ranking in each catergory.

As well as the best places to live, the EIU also ranked the worst - with 28 cities seeing their score drop because of civil unrest from the Arab Spring.

Unsurprisingly, war-town Syrian capital Damascus finished bottom of the list.

Tripoli in Libya and Tehran in Iran also ranked close to the bottom.

Winner: Australia's second city was lauded in all categories, scoring the maximum 100 out of 100 for its healthcare, education and infrastructure and being awarded 95 and 95.1 in the stability and culture and environment categories respectively. The city, home to 4.2million, has topped the rankings for the past three years, scoring 97.5 overall. Melbourne is famed for its vibrant multi-culturalism, burgeoning arts scene, excellent food and wine and is the sporting capital of Australia.

Runner up: Vienna was one of only two European cities to make the top ten. Like Melbourne, it scored maximum marks in terms of healthcare, education and infrastructure, and matched the city in terms of stability. But surprisingly, given that the Austrian capital is steeped in history, it fell short in the culture and environment category with a score of 94.4. As well as its history Vienna has a colourful contemporary arts and culture scene, a bustling nightlife, picturesque vineyards on the outskirts and an innovative performing arts scene.

Third place: Vancouver in Canada Scored top marks for health, education, and culture and environment. It gained third spot thanks to its 95 out of 100 ranking in terms of stability and a 92.9 mark for infrastructure. The city is known for its majestic natural beauty located between the Coast Mountains and the Pacific ocean. The city is relatively small compared to some of the other top ten destinations with a little over 600,000 living there.

Fourth: Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario and the most populated city in Canada. It scored top marks in terms of stability, healthcare and education, but fell short of the winners as it scored 97.2 in terms of culture and environment and a relatively low 89.3 in terms of infrastructure. The city's most famous landmark is the CN Tower, which at 1,815 ft tall is one of the world's tallest buildings. The city's surrounds are home to some stunning wineries.

Fifth: Calgary is the largest city in Alberta, with a population of almost 1.1million. It scored 100 out of 100 in the stability. healthcare and education categories as well as an impressive 96.4 in terms of infrastructure. But it didn't hit top spot because of its 89.1 rating for culture. It was once ranked the world's cleanest place to live by Forbes magazine. It's a relatively young city but still claims to have a rich history and was the first ever venue for the Winter Olympics.

Sixth: Known as Australia's wine capital, Adelaide scored top marks for healthcare and education. But it could only muster 95 in terms of stability, 94.2 in terms of culture and environment and 96.4 in terms of infrastructure. The city's tourism website describes it as the '20 minute city' with all amenities including the airport and beauty spots such as Adelaide Hills within a short distance of the city centre. Adelaide has a diverse cultural mix.

Seventh heaven: Sydney is the third of Australia's four cities in the top ten. It scored top marks for healthcare, education and infrastructure, but 90 for stability and 94.4 for culture. Famed for its outdoor lifestyle, the city's iconic landmarks include the Harbour Bridge, the Opera house and some of the world's most beautiful beaches. Sydney is a great place to live if you like watersports, surfing, seafood and wine.

Eighth: The Finnish capital scored top marks for stability and healthcare and impressive scores of 96.4 for infrastructure, 91.7 for education and 90 for culture and environment. It is the most populous city in Finland and located on a picturesque arm of the Baltic Sea coastline. It is famed for its art nouveau architecture and maintains its small-town feel despite being an international municipality and a hub for Finnish commerce.

Nine: The final Australian entry in the top ten. Perth hit top marks in healthcare, education, and infrastructure and scored 95 in the stability category. But its overall marked was dragged down by an 88.7 score for culture and environment. It is the largest city in Western Australia and home to almost 1.9million people. Australia's 'sunniest capital city', Perth mixes vibrant city culture with stunning nature and is home to some gorgeous beaches.

Top ten: Auckland in New Zealand scored top marks for its education. It scored 95 and above in all other categories bar infrastructure, which saw it score 92.9. Like many others in the top ten, Auckland, known as Tamaki Makaurau to the indigenous Maori people, combines nature and a vibrant city life. The city claims that everyone lives within half hour of a beautiful beach, a hiking trail and 'a dozen enchanted holiday islands'.
