Frances O'Grady, TUC general secretary, said workers will strike if they do not benefit from improving economy

Britain could be hit by a wave of strikes if workers are not given bumper pay rises after five years of pain since the recession began, the boss of the TUC warns today.  

Frances O’Grady said people are feeling ‘frustrated’ and that they will demand ‘their fair share of the rewards’ over the next 12 months if the anticipated economic recovery gathers pace.

Ms O’Grady said: ‘For most people, well for everybody that I’ve ever met, strike action is always the last resort. But people are feeling frustrated.

‘And I think what we will see perhaps if the economy is on the road to recovery people will want their fair share of the rewards. They’ve been told to tighten their belts for years now. They are looking to have a fair share of that recovery.’

There is growing evidence that Britain’s economy is recovering with the strongest growth spurt for more than 15 years.

And the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development predicts Britain will be the best-performing major economy for the rest of the year.

Tory MP Charlie Elphicke criticised Miss O’Grady. He said: ‘The Government has been working tirelessly to build the recovery and get people back into work. No sooner do things start looking up and the TUC want to take them out on strike again. They are completely out of touch.’

Ms O'Grady said the public was against the Royal Mail sell-off and was not in favour of firefighters working later in life.

She said she had met with unions who have held or are planning ballots, and despite the 'hurdles' surrounding industrial action, there were ways the TUC could help spread messages to the public.

Last year's TUC Congress called for a study into the practicalities of a general strike, but Ms O'Grady said it was more appropriate to focus on the disputes which were breaking out in a number of industries and sectors.

The TUC leader said she wanted to shine a spotlight next week on what was happening to ordinary families across the country, often struggling to make ends meet.

'Signs of economic recovery are obviously welcome, but they are not based on wage growth, they are based on household debt.

Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said the TUC 'are completely out of touch'

'There has been a 6 per cent cut in real pay since the crash, and people are still finding things very tough.

'We have big problems with youth unemployment and the new phenomenon of under-employment. Four out of five jobs created since the crash are in low paid industries, and nearly half are temporary.'

Ms O'Grady said full employment, decent and affordable homes and fair pay were issues the TUC will be campaigning on, amid complaints of growing pay inequality.

'A smaller share of the national cake goes into wage packets, yet one of the best ways to boost demand is to improve workers' bargaining power.

'We must aspire to create more decent jobs rather than a new servant class on rubbish pay and precarious conditions.'

Ms O'Grady said she believed Labour leader Ed Miliband will get a good reception when he addresses the conference next Tuesday, despite tensions over his planned affiliation reforms.

The GMB has announced it will cut its affiliation funding from £1.2million to £150,000 from January following Mr Miliband's call for union members to opt in to joining Labour rather than being automatically affiliated, a decision which could cost the party millions of pounds.

She said the payout of one year’s pay was ‘custom and practice’ for TUC leaders, which must be agreed by its executive committee. She added: ‘Who knows where we will be when I get to retire?’
