As the government shutdown enters a third week, a group of veterans and tea party groups protested their anger by storming the World War II memorial in Washington, DC.

The protest Sunday started at the World War II memorial before moving to the National Mall and eventually winding up outside the White House.

'Tear down these walls,' the crowd chanted. Protesters also sang 'God bless America' and other patriotic songs as they entered the memorial plaza.

The memorial has become a political symbol in the bitter fight between Democrats and Republicans over who is at fault since the shutdown began. Earlier rallies have focused on allowing access for World War II veterans visiting from across the country with the Honor Flight Network.

A protest by truckers converged with a rally by a group called the Million Vet March at the World War II Memorial. Participants cut the links between metal barriers at the National Park Service site and pushed them aside.

Jeff Thompkins of New York told WRC-TV he was there because people fight and died for the freedom to visit public spaces and to protest.

'Our constitutional rights are being taken away,' Thompkins said. 'People made the ultimate sacrifice, and they should be open to the public, open to everyone to come down here and see this.

This is ridiculous. This is not just and not fair. Itâ€™s just not fair.'

Jim Weller of Allentown, Pennsylvania came to the protest to 'stand up for me rights'.

'My father was a World War II veteran, shot down in the Philippines in 1945, and for them to shut down this memorial is absurd,' Mr Weller said.

Fellow-protester Cindy Good wanted this to be a message to lawmakers in Congress.

'They need to listen to the American People,' she said. 'And try to work together in Congress to get this whole thing worked out.'

The rally then made its way towards the White House, according to NBC Washington.

Protesters carried barricades, likely from the monument, to the front gates of the White House, as shown on security footage.

The demonstration was soon broken up by police, and most protesters boarded buses out of the area.

Almost 60 per cent of Utahans responding to a Brigham Young University poll this past week said they want Sen. Lee to compromise, even if it means funding Obamacare. His approval rating has dropped from 71 per cent in June to only 57 per cent, the poll added.

Protester Melissa Mather called the memorial's closure 'a slap in the face to all Americans' and she believes that President Obama and all the lawmakers should resign.

'I just want to take them all and shake them,' the Havre de Grade, Maryland-resident said.

Don Armstrong, a veteran who served in Somalia, KOsovo, Iraq and Afghanistan drove to the rally from West Virginia. He attended the protest because he relies on veterans benefits and is afraid disability payments will soon stop.

'I'm not a Democrat or Republic or anything like that,' he said. 'I blame them all.'

Last week, Veteran Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki told Congress that benefits would end on November 1 if the shutdown was still going on.

Republican leaders attended the event Sunday and turned it into a platform to speak their position.

Republican Utah Senator Mike Lee and Governor Sarah Palin attended the event. Mr Cruz said President Barack Obama is using veterans as pawns in the shutdown.

One of the most outspoken tea party-backed politicians in the beltway, Sen. Lee led the charge to defund or delay funding to Obamacare that is widely credited with causing the shutdown.

With only four days left until the federal government runs out of money, Washington has been brought to its knees. Running the risk of defaulting on massive debt, and unable to pay federal employees, Congress has an all-time low single-digit approval rating.

'This is the people's memorial,' Ms Palin said. 'Our veterans should be above politics.'
