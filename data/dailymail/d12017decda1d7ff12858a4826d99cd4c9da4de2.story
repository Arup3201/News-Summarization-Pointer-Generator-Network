Actress Katherine Heigl has filed a $6 million civil lawsuit against New
 York pharmacy Duane Reade for using her name and an unauthorized 
paparazzi photograph of her in its commercial advertising.

The actress is said to be livid that photographs of her leaving the New York store last month carrying several shopping bags were used by the company, who tweeted the snap along with the caption: 'Love a quick #DuaneReade run? Even @KatieHeigl can't resist shopping #NYC's favorite drugstore.'

The complaint said she was photographed in March near a Duane Reade 
store in New York while filming a new television series.

Duane Reade 
posted the photo on its Twitter and Facebook account with captions 
advertising the store without her approval, the complaint said.

A picture's worth $6 million apparently! Katherine Heigl is suing drug store chain Duane Reade for using this photo of her leaving one of their New York stores last month to promote the company without her consent

Duane Reade did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

'We
 expect Duane Reade to pay for its willful misuse of Katherine Heigl's 
name and likeness,' said her lawyer Peter Haviland, adding that any 
money recovered would go to a charity she has supported for many years.

The
 complaint said Heigl intends to donate all proceeds from the lawsuit to
 The Jason Debus Heigl Foundation, which was established in 2008 after 
her brother was killed in a car accident.

The lawsuit reads like a virtual résumé, though it greatly exaggerates the mom-of-two's career success, having failed to have a hit TV show or film since she left Grey's Anatomy in 2010 due to her conflict with creator Shonda Rhimes.

'Plaintiff is a highly successful television and motion picture actress, producer and celebrity,' the documents read, listing her various credits. 'Plaintiff continues to be in high demand in the entertainment industry.'

It continues: 'A recent search for "Katherine Heigl" on the Google search engine returned over 3.2 million results.'

'Plaintiff continues to be in high demand in the entertainment industry': The actress - snapped picking up supplies on March 16 with her mother, Nancy - states in her lawsuit that she is a 'highly successful television and motion picture actress, producer and celebrity'

It also cites as many as 754,000 Twitter followers - which is in stark contrast to big-name stars such as her Killers co-star Ashton Kutcher, who has 15.9 million.

The lawsuit said the tweet featured a paparazzi photograph of Heigl which was also posted on Facebook. 

It included a logo in the lower right corner that said, 'Just Jared,' 
referring to a celebrity news website specializing in paparazzi 
photographs.

It added that the 
actress 'is highly selective and well compensated' when she chooses to 
endorse a product or service. But she did not authorize the store to use
 her name, picture or image.

'Duane Reade is liable for not less than $6 million in compensatory and punitive or treble damages,' according to the lawsuit.

On Thursday a source told UsWeekly that the former child star had contacted the company before filing.

'Her attorneys reached out to Duane Reade after [the tweet] was posted,; the insider told the site.

'They called and asked for it to be taken down, and Duane Reade ignored them. She tried repeatedly to have this settled without a lawsuit.'

All for a good cause: While the damages she's seeking are undoubtedly inflated, the lawsuit at least specifies that all proceeds will go to animal welfare league The Jason Debus Heigl Foundation - founded by Katherine and Nancy in memory of her late brother
