Never seen before pictures of a two-headed shark have been revealed by an American fisherman.

Christopher Johnston was working as a longline fisherman in the Indian Ocean when a pregnant blue shark was hauled aboard  somewhere between 200 and 900 
miles off West Australia in September, 2008.

When he cut open the creature, the freak foetus was discovered inside. He decided to share the photographs after scientists confirmed the discovery of a different two-headed bull shark foetus, off the coast of Mexico.

Never seen before pictures of a two headed shark have been revealed by an American fisherman

Christopher Johnston, a former longline fisherman, discovered the shark foetus inside a pregnant blue shark was hauled in on September 27, 2008

It was the first time the condition had ever been recorded in a bull shark.

The former commercial fisherman, currently a fishing guide for royals in Dubai,  contacted National Geographic News to share the photos. 

Unlike the two-headed bull shark, the two heads on the blue shark foetus are separated completely in a freak of nature.

He told National Geographic News that fishermen often cut open pregnant sharks because they are only allowed to keep 20 blue sharks on a boat at a 
time, including foetal ones.

He said that normally when they cut open a pregnant blue shark there could be almost a hundred pups in there.

He said: 'We toss them in the water 
and they usually swim off fine. I cut open quite a few and that was the 
only strange one I ever saw.'

While there have been only about a half dozen reported cases of two-headed sharks, the condition has been seen in a number of animals, including human beings.

It occurs when the embryo does not finish splitting into twins, in the same process which produces conjoined twins.

Experts said had the two-headed shark
been born, it would not have survived since it wouldn’t be able to swim
away from predators.

It comes after scientists confirmed the discovery of a two-headed bull shark foetus - which at the time was believed to be the world's first ever. It was found in the Gulf of Mexico, by a fisherman when he opened the uterus of an adult shark

MRI scans of the shark revealed two distinct heads, hearts and stomachs. The rest of the body then rejoined to form a single tail

The condition of having more than one head is known as polycephaly, with two-headedness described specifically by the terms bicephaly or dicephaly.

But the creatures rarely live beyond a few months.

Each head of a polycephalic animal has its own brain, and they share control of the organs and limbs, though the specific structure of the connections varies.

Such animals often move in a disoriented and dizzy fashion, with the brains 'arguing' with each other leading some specimens to simply zig-zag without getting anywhere.

In snakes, each head may attack and even attempt to swallow the other.

He said: 'I didn’t think it was that 
special but apparently it is. It looked like it had one dorsal fin and 
one umbilical cord. It had teeth like normal pups.'

The single bullshark - with two heads
- was found in the Gulf of Mexico, according to a study by Michigan 
State University and reported in the Journal of Fish Biology.

It was discovered by a fisherman when
he opened the uterus of an adult shark in 2011, around a year after the
Deepwater horizon oil spill, in the Gulf of Mexico.

While other species of sharks have 
been born with two heads - including blue sharks and tope sharks - this 
is the first record of it in a bull shark.

Bull
sharks are one of only a few species of shark that attacks humans, and 
are also popular with fisherman, as they put up a 'good fight'.

Michael Wagner, MSU assistant professor of fisheries and wildlife, told the Register: 'They're hardy little critters.

'But
despite this, the two-headed specimen probably would have died after 
birth. It was near-to-term, but should have been a lot larger – the body
looks to have invested so much energy in growing a separate head that 
the rest of the body was foreshortened.'

Most of the two-headed creatures shortly after birth, and in this case the creature died shortly after it was discovered,

Mr Wagner said there were many  more cases of two-headed lizards and snakes, because they are often bred in captivity where breeders can observe and monitor the oddities.

After it was discovered, the shark was taken to the marine science department at Florida Keys Community College and then to Michigan State’s campu where Mr Wagner and his team used magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) to study it.

They revealed two distinct heads, hearts and stomachs.

The rest of the body then rejoined to form a single tail.

While the professor noted in his research that some may link the deformed shark to exposure to pollutants, to link it to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill would be 'unwarranted'.

He added: 'We simply have no evidence to support that cause or any other.'

According to the International Shark 
Attack File, there were 80 instances of unprovoked shark attack against 
humans in 2012, with seven deaths.
