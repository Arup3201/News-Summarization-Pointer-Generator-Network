The family of a 13-year-old Virginia girl who committed suicide last weekend say she was bullied to death.

Faith Crusenberry of Berryville, Virginia hung herself last Sunday 'as the result of bullying', according to a blog post by a pastor who is a friend of the family.

'My stepdaughter took her own life on Sunday afternoon, due to bullying,' Faith's stepfather Mike Mantz told News4. 'I want awareness increased. I do not want my daughter to die in vain.'

Victim: 13-year-old Faith Crusenberry committed suicide last weekend after allegedly being bullied

Gone: Faith was a seventh-grade honor student at Johnson-Williams Middle School and enjoyed singing, dancing, music, cooking, fashion and hair styling

According to Faith's obituary, she was an honor student at Johnson-Williams Middle School and enjoyed singing, dancing, music, cooking, fashion and hair styling.

'Faith was considered a great friend by many and was normally the first to speak her mind and crack a joke,' her obituary read. 'She would routinely attend church with her step-dad and could be found helping out in some manner during set up or in the children's ministry. She will be sorely missed by her family and classmates.'

It isn't certain who bullied Faith, or what specifically drove her to suicide, but she was certainly loved by many of her peers.

Too young: Friends of Faith mourned her passing on Twitter

Many young people mourned her loss online.

Family friend David Mikolajczak said Faith's death has really impacted the community.

'We all care about our children, Faith and our own, and many of the children in Berryville are, "saddened" isn't the right word,' Mr Mikolajzak said at Faith's memorial Friday.

Grief counselors were brought into Faith's school for students that needed help processing her death.

Faith is survived by her mother, father, step-father, brother, four half-siblings and all four of her grandparents.
