The Sweet Chariot thunders on. England recovered from a false start at Twickenham and the early loss of full-back Mike Brown to maintain their RBS Six Nations title quest with a resounding win.

Stuart Lancaster’s national team were behind for the first quarter of this match, as they struggled to generate the level of intensity shown during their seismic triumph in Cardiff eight days earlier. But when they needed inspiration, it was delivered in stunning fashion by Jonathan Joseph.

Following his try-scoring heroics at the Millennium Stadium, the on-song Bath centre illuminated proceedings on his first start in a home Test. The 23-year-old scored twice – either side of half-time – as England made light of their initial problems to cut loose. Both his tries were acts of attacking genius, showcasing the pace and footwork which have drawn increasing comparisons with Jeremy Guscott, who was watching on from a TV studio.

Once they had taken charge in the second half, England ruthlessly went for the jugular and claimed four tries in the space of 14 productive minutes. While a late Italian try would have been a source of frustration for the coaches, they will have be satisfied with a 30-point winning margin, after falling short of the title on points-difference in the last two years.

The head injury sustained by Brown is a concern, but there were several performances to savour. Ben Youngs was an astute livewire at scrum-half, Joe Marler maintained his recent high standards, rookie lock George Kruis excelled again and Chris Robshaw led with now familiar distinction. Billy Vunipola was a rampaging force at No 8 and Joseph provided the show-stopping highlights.

The anticipated script would not have featured an Italian try within the first four minutes, but that was the reality as the visitors surged ahead in fine style. Having contrived to lose the first two lineouts on their own throw, Marco Bortolami managed to steal a throw intended for Chris Robshaw and the ball was rapidly transferred across to the opposite flank.

Sergio Parisse, Italy’s talismanic captain, made good ground down the left and after a strong drive by Leonardo Ghiraldini, Kelly Haimona and Leonardo Sarto combined to release Parisse again. The No 8 dummied outside and charged on through Dan Cole’s tackle to score.

Haimona missed the conversion but the Azzurri’s Kiwi fly-half continued to pose a threat to the hosts in open play. In the 13th minute, he picked a low pass neatly off the ground and chipped into England’s 22, where Andrea Masi claimed the ball and collided with Mike Brown. The attack fizzled out and there was a prolonged delay as the stricken Brown was placed on a stretcher and carried off.

While the home side were forced into a back-line reshuffle – after electing to bring on Billy Twelvetrees rather than Danny Cipriani, who has previously operated at full-back – the break in proceedings allowed them to re-group and they began to impose themselves. There was another scare when George Fabio Biagi’s interception led to a defensive scramble, but the tide was slowly turning.

A 21st-minute George Ford penalty belatedly put England on the scoreboard and three minutes later, they had their first try, although it was a marginal decision to award it. From an attacking lineout on the left, Dave Attwood sent Billy Vunipola storming into the corner, but he appeared to be held up by Edoardo Gori. Replays were inconclusive, but the TMO ruled that a try could be awarded.

Italy were still coming to terms with that setback when they conceded another try which was a masterpiece of individual running class. It stemmed from a turn-over as Robshaw stole the ball at a ruck near halfway and it was sent out to Joseph on the right.

The No 13 – now operating on the wing – left Haimona flailing with a nimble side-step and accelerated into space. He then shaped to pass outside, raced on past Sarto’s desperate attempted ankle-tap and away to score and bring the house down.

Ford added the conversion and England maintained their 10-point advantage as Haimona missed two penalty shots at goal. Lancaster’s men then had a chance for a third try before the break, but Jonny May slipped and failed to make use of a two-man overlap outside.

After half-time, Ford struck another penalty but then – out of the blue – Italy hit back with a second try of their own. It was a gem, too. Sarto chipped out of defence, regathered the ball and ran on, before being tackled deep in English territory. When the ball was sent in-field, Luca Morisi ran a forceful line straight past Attwood and clear. He was half-tackled by Watson but leapt back up and went over the line.

But the Azzurri revival was short-lived. In the 55th minute, England won a penalty from a scrum in front of the Italian posts and as the visitors switched off, Ben Youngs took a quick tap and dived over to score. Ford duly converted and landed another penalty just before the hour mark.

Shortly afterwards, Joseph struck again. The ball came to Ford from a scrum near halfway and his canny, delayed pass put his Bath team-mate straight through a gap and his pace took him away from the cover defenders to touch down his second try and Ford converted before going off.

His replacement, Danny Cipriani, took just seconds to make his mark. Jonny May scorched past tiring opponents on the left and cut inside, then picked out the supporting run by Sale’s fly-half, who claimed a try on his first Six Nations appearance for seven years. He converted it too, but was unable to claim the extras after Nick Easter marked his own Twickenham comeback by scoring from a lineout drive 11 minutes from time. Morisi added a late consolation try at the other end, but it did little to tarnish the English feel-good mood.
