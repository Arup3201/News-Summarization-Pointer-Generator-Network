Tragedy: Student Archie Wellbelove, 18, (pictured) was killed when a taxi hit him on a stretch of road where the street lights were switched off to save money

A cost-cutting council ‘contributed’ to the death of a university student by switching off its street lights, a coroner has said.

Archie Wellbelove was hit by a taxi five days after Warwickshire Council switched off selected lights across the county in a bid to save £500,000 a year.

Road safety campaigners have long warned of the dangers of unlit streets – as councils across Britain continue to dim or turn off their lights completely to save money and meet climate change targets.

Warwickshire Council has even admitted that by doing this, safety will inevitably be compromised.

Mr Wellbelove, who was in his first year at Warwick University, was killed on the A452 near Leamington in the early hours of December 7, 2012, on his way home from a night out.

The taxi driver said he was unable to see the 18-year-old because the road was too dark, adding that it was the first time he noticed the street lights were switched off.

Coroner Dr Richard Brittain recorded a narrative conclusion following the inquest at Warwickshire Justice Centre on Friday, but forced the county council into an early review of its street lighting policy on that stretch of road.

A county-wide review was due next July, and a review of that stretch was taken following Mr Wellbelove’s death, but Dr Brittain said: ‘I do not believe the specifics of this case have been reviewed by those who have the power to do so sufficiently and I feel a delay until July is unacceptable.

'I think a review will be helpful and I will be issuing a report to prevent future deaths.’

Graham Fitton, head of transport and highways at the county council, confirmed that lights on that stretch of road are left on later on Friday and Saturday nights following the death, but insisted the lights policy and the speed limit on the street were appropriate.

Asked about the lights switch-off in general, he said: ‘If I have to save £500,000 then whatever I do will always have an impact on safety in some way.’

Tribute: The 18-year-old (pictured) was in his first year at Warwick University studying English and French and his family spoke of a much-loved and talented young man at his inquest

Mr Wellbelove, who was studying English and French and played rugby 
at county level, was described by his family as ‘beautiful, intelligent 
and very witty’.

Experts: Police said today that the taxi driver who hit Archie would have had less than two seconds to react because of the darkness

Taxi driver Mour Ali, who cried in court, 
recalled how he didn’t see the student or know what he’d hit after 
hearing a loud bang.

Mr Ali, who has driven a taxi in the area for 13 
years, said: ‘I was used to the road being lit, that was the first time I
 noticed they switched the lights off. It was very dark.

‘I wasn’t
 speeding, I was just going along and suddenly – bang. I think about it 
every morning, all the time. I have my own kid – he was just a kid.’

It
 took more than 45 minutes for emergency services to find Mr 
Wellbelove’s body which was discovered only after the street lights were
 switched back on.

Investigators from Warwickshire Police concluded that
 he was walking in the road with his back to traffic before he was hit.

They also found that in the poor lighting conditions, Mr Ali wouldn’t 
have been able to react in time even if he had seen Mr Wellbelove.

PC
 Dean Male said it would have been a ‘benefit’ if the streets lights had
 been left on.

He said: ‘At 40mph, the driver would have literally had 
two seconds to have seen the pedestrian and reacted.’

The court 
heard how Mr Wellbelove was three and half times over the drink-drive 
limit when he decided to walk nine miles home from Evolve nightclub in 
Leamington towards his hall of residence on the campus in Coventry.Dr
 Brittain concluded: ‘Archie died from injuries which resulted from a 
road traffic collision.

'Multiple factors taken together contributed to 
the collision including the lack of street lighting, Archie’s dark 
clothing, his direction of travel and his position in the road.

'On the 
balance of evidence it’s not possible to isolate anything specific.’

After
 the inquest Mr Wellbelove’s mother Katie, from Biggleswade in 
Bedfordshire, said: ‘We are very happy with the verdict and that the 
light situation will be looked at. It was certainly a contributing 
factor.’
