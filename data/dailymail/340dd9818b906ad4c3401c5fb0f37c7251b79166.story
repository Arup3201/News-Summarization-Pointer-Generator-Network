The agent of Dinamo Zagreb midfielder Marcelo Brozovic claims he will hold talks with Arsenal in November over a possible move.

The 21-year-old, who plays as a box to box style midfielder, featured for Croatia at the World Cup this summer and has attracted interest from a number of clubs.

His representative, Miroslav Bicanic, intends to discuss possible moves when Croatia play USA for an international friendly.
