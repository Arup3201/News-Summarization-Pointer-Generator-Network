With their near-death experiences and tumultuous love lives - plus the odd major disaster - soap characters seem to have nine lives.

But even when they are killed off, it’s rarely the last we’ll see of the actors who play them.

When soap stars announce they’re quitting the show for bigger things, it’s not Hollywood that’s beckoning, but Holby City or EastEnders.

As ex-Emmerdale actress Claire King joins Coronation Street, we chart the fortunes of those stars who can’t make a clean break from soap...

Claire King joined Emmerdale in 1989 as super bitch Kim Tate (right). She quit after ten years, and from 2005 she was in Hollyoaks, in which she played no less than three roles. This month Claire, 51, will become a Corrie regular as barmaid Erika

Ross Kemp was famed as EastEnders hard man Grant Mitchell (left with Martine McCutcheon). He quit in 1999 and returned twice before making documentaries about real gangs. Kemp played an Army deserter in Emmerdale in 1986 (right)

Back in 1983, Beverley Callard briefly played Angie Richards, a chip shop cashier in Emmerdale with a big mouth and bigger hair (right). Since 1989 she’s been in and out of Corrie as landlady Liz McDonald, famous for her plunging necklines (left)

From 1992-96, Denise Black played Corrie’s siren hairdresser Denise Osbourne (pictured right), with a comeback in 2007. Last year, she crossed the Pennines and arrived in Emmerdale as Joanie Wright (left), the adoptive gran of Adam Wyatt’s son, Kyle

It’s hard to imagine June Brown as anyone other than Dot Cotton (pictured left), the chain-smoking launderette lady in EastEnders — a part she has played for 30 years. But in 1970, she was briefly in Coronation Street (right) with Ena Sharples

In EastEnders, Michelle Collins was Cindy, Ian Beale’s cheating wife (right) from 1998 until she was killed off in jail ten years later. In 2011, she joined Corrie as Stella Price (pictured left with screen husband John Michie), quitting this year

As put-upon housewife Sheila Grant, Sue Johnston made her name in gritty Liverpudlian soap Brookside between 1982 and 1989 (centre). In September 2012 she joined the Street, playing randy granny Gloria Price for 18 months (left), although she’d already appeared in the soap three times in 1982 (right)

Long before she started cutting hair in Weatherfield, Sue Nicholls played Marilyn Gates, a waitress in Crossroads, in the mid-Sixties (left). Since 1985 she’s been Corrie regular Audrey Roberts (pictured right with Bryan Mosley as Alf Roberts)

After 25 years as the Street’s brassy barmaid Bet Lynch (pictured right), Julie Goodyear’s departure in 1995 was big news, though she revisited the role several times. She later appeared in Hollyoaks as Mrs Temple — a brassy B&B owner (left)

For 15 years, Gillian Taylforth was Kathy Beale in EastEnders (pictured right with Steve McFadden) before quitting in 2000. In 2013, Gillian joined Hollyoaks as Sandy Roscoe (left), mum to six ne’er-do-well, murdering sons. She left this year

In 1993, Sherrie Hewson became Maureen Naylor, the scatty shop assistant in Corrie — axed four years later, only to return in 2006 (pictured right). In 2001, she was Virginia Raven, a receptionist in the revival of Crossroads (centre). She went to Emmerdale in 2004 (left), playing Lesley Meredith for two years
