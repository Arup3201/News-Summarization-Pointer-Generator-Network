A multimillionaire CEO has been caught on newly-released surveillance video repeatedly kicking a puppy.

Des Hague was seen in an elevator in a Vancouver apartment building repeatedly booting the doberman pup in the stomach as it flinches against the wall. 

He is the head of Centerplate, a $6 billion-dollar company which provides snacks at sports and entertainment arenas across the U.S., with more than 30,000 employees and clients including the Superdome in New Orleans, the Javits Center in New York City and college sports arenas like Notre Dame.

A multimillionaire CEO was caught on this elevator surveillance tape in Vancouver, Canada, repeated kicking a friend's doberman puppy 

Des Hague, CEO of multibillion-dollar company Centerplate, apologized on Monday for kicking a friend's puppy saying it was 'utterly out of character' 

Centerplate released a statement on Tuesday which read: 'In no way do we condone the mistreatment of animals. This is a personal matter involving our CEO that we are currently investigating.'

The company said Mr Hague had agreed to attend counselling for anger management. 

No criminal charges have been filed against him.  

In a statement, reported by WTSP, Mr Hague said that his despicable actions were 'utterly out of character'. 

He added: 'I am ashamed and deeply embarrassed a minor frustration with a friend's pet caused me to lose control of my emotional response. 

'I would like to extend my apology to my family, company and clients, as I understand that this has also reflected negatively on them.'

The CEO has since taken down his social media accounts. 

Des Hague has been at the top for Centerplate since 2009. He is a veteran of the food-service industry having held senior positions at IHOP, Safeway and Taco Bell, according to Fortune.
