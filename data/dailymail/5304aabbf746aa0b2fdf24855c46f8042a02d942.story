Officer Larry Tuttle, 40, was identified by police as the victim of a murder-suicide along with an unidentified woman at a Dallas apartment complex

An six-year veteran Dallas cop was pronounced dead along with an unidentified woman in a murder-suicide Saturday night. 

Officer Larry Tuttle, 40, was identified by police arriving to a report of gunfire at Lake Highlands Landing apartments. 

'Preliminary investigation indicates that the female shot and killed Officer Tuttle prior to taking her own life,' Officer Juan Fernandez told press in a written statement.

'It's a difficult time for the department and family,' he added. 

A six-year old child reportedly spotted exiting the apartment was later found unharmed. 

'I heard probably four or five gunshots altogether,' said neighbor Trui Mitchell. 'There was a few, and then you could hear a girl crying out, 'Oh God, oh God!' and then I heard a couple more shots.'

The relationship between Tuttle and the woman has yet to be explained, or what if any connection he may have had to the child.  

'Honestly, I had some tears I did shed, it's very sad,' neighbor Aaron Cano told WFAA. 'My heart goes out to her; she's too little to witness that.'

Police are keeping the name of the woman out of the media until her next of kin has been notified. 

A six-year old child seen fleeing the scene at the apartment was reportedly unharmed

At least one neighbor told reporters Tuttle had an elementary school-aged son.  

'[They were] playing with different things, playing with his toys, cleaning up his house sometimes, things like that,' Jared Ingram said of spotting the pair. 

He called the police officer a 'good neighbor.'

Residents were only allowed back into the apartment complex several hours after the shooting and undergoing questioning from police.
