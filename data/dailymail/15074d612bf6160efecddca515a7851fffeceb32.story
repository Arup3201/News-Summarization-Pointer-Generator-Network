Tragic: Levi Brailsford, aged, 2, who died after falling out of his grandmothers car

A conwoman has been going door-to-door pretending she is collecting 'donations' for a two-year-old's gravestone after he fell to his death from a moving car.

Levi Brailsford's grieving family claimed the woman has been calling at houses across Bristol using the ruse to trick people into handing over cash.

The boy died in Stockwood, Bristol, on May 11 after unbuckling his harness and apparently opening the door of the moving vehicle.

The family, who recently held the boy's funeral, said they have not asked anyone to collect money on their behalf.

Residents living in Redland, Bristol, said they had been called by a woman claiming to be fundraising for Levi's funeral and headstone.

The boy's family have been contacted by friends with similar stories about a mystery woman asking for donations.

Levi's father Kevin said: 'If it was legitimate and the proceeds were coming to us for our son, there would be no problem with it.

'But we haven't asked anyone to do it and for anyone to make any money in my poor boy's name is very upsetting for us all. People shouldn't give this woman any money because we don't know who she is.

'I've had a lot of phone calls about it and I was so worried I told our family liaison officer at the police.'

Fresh agony: Levi's parents Kevin and Andrea were hit by the news that a conwoman has been falsely claiming she is collecting money for their dead son's headstone

Tribute: One of the bears that was left at the scene of Levi's death holds a message to the tragic two-year-old

Among the messages was a note from Levi's parents, Kevin and Andrea, who have been left devastated by the accident

Grief: The dead boy's family have been rocked by fresh claims that a conwoman has been going door-to-door claiming she is collecting money for them

The 33-year-old from Stockwood, 
Bristol, said: 'We will be raising money for the air ambulance with a 
sponsored walk in June, but that is still being organised.'

Jo
Broome, who lives in Redland, said: 'A female, reporting to be a 
"family friend" of the Brailsford family is scouring the Redland area 
asking for donations to help pay for the funeral and headstone.

'She
was very thin, had blondish hair tied back in a very tight ponytail and
a very gruff voice. Her complexion was very white looking and she was 
about 5ft 4ins.

Wellwishers: Friends of the boy's family leave flowers at the spot where he tragically fell to his death

'She had a 
paper cutting of the story in a clear plastic envelope and was taking 
the name of anyone who had donated some money for the funeral on a scrap
piece of paper.'

South Bristol Cemetery was packed last Friday as the two-year-old was laid to rest.

His father Kevin and mother Andrea, 29, released balloons into the sky, followed by scores more from family and friends.

Avon and Somerset Police spokeswoman 
Claire Stanley said: 'Both police and the family of Levi are aware of a 
woman who claims to be collecting on behalf of them for a headstone.

'None of these collections has been sanctioned by the family.'
