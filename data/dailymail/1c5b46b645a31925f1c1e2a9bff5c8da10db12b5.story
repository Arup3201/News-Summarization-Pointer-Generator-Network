The 29-year-old scored 50 goals in 57 matches over the last two seasons at Feyenoord and if his early-season form is anything to go by Saints fans could enjoy quite a season.

Many expected Ronald Koeman's side to struggle after the departure of so many stars but they currently sit just three points behind Chelsea in second place.

Next up for Southampton is trip to White Hart Lane where they will face old boss Mauricio Pochettino and his Tottenham side.
