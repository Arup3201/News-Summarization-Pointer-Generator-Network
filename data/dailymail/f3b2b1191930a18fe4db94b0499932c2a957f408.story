He says he liked her for her great spirit, her feisty rebellious side and the fact that she's 'kind of wild'.

But although shamed director Rupert Sanders was talking about the acting qualities of his partner in extra-marital relations Kristen Stewart, he could surely have been referring to his betrayed wife, Liberty Ross.

The stunning model and actress has revealed her own feisty, rebellious side in a short film for luxury lingerie brand Damaris.

The sultry online video - directed by acclaimed commercial director Johnny Green for Damaris in association with mywardrobe.com - is called Packing Heat.

It features mother-of-two Ross, 32, as a gun-brandishing femme fatale who engages in a firearm battle with a second woman wearing pink Damaris lingerie.

In heavy, smudged, glittery make-up, Ross parades around a dark house wearing provocative black lacy Damaris lingerie, a short black dress and black stilettos.

Quoting Jean-Luc Godard, Green said: 'All you need for a movie is a gun and a girl.'

Damaris founder and creative director Damaris Evans said: 'When one of the world's most acclaimed commercial directors calls you to make a knicker film for your brand... you say yes!

'Knickers, a gun, explosions… clearly a man's idea, and fantasy… and then Liberty Ross...that tops it off!'

Though the video was originally banned by YouTube for, according to Ross, 'its hot model/lingerie/gun content', it is now available to watch on the streaming site.

For Liberty herself, a wider range of
roles may soon be on offer thanks to the training she underwent for filming.

She said: 'I went to a training centre where they teach actors to shoot for movies.They'd just trained Christian Bale for his Batman role. And I can now shoot pistols, rifles and AK47s.'

The video premiered at London's Somerset House during London Fashion Week last September, but interest in it has piqued over the past few days in light of revelations that Ross' director husband Sanders had an affair with Twilight star Kristen Stewart, the star of his new film Snow White And The Huntsman.

In the film, Stewart played Snow White and Ross played Snow White's late mother.
