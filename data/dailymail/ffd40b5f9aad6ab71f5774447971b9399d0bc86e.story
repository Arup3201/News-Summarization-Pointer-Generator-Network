A rugby league star played through the pain barrier after being kneed in the groin and suffering a ruptured testicle in a cup final match before calmly heading off to hospital to have it surgically removed.

Warrington Wolves prop forward Paul Wood lost more than the match when his team went down 26-18 to Leeds in the Super League Grand Final.

Mr Wood, who celebrates his 31st birthday on Wednesday, was hurt early in the second half of the match at Old Trafford, but finished the game and even appeared in a post match interview where he made no mention of his injury.

Joker: The dedictaed prop forward made light of the unfortunate incident on Twitter after his surgery

He is 
now out of hospital after undergoing surgery overnight and even managed to joke 
about the incident on Sunday morning.

One of his tweets read: 'Ruptured my right testicle, got a knee 1 minute into the second half, had to have it removed.'

In the afternoon he added: 'Just coming out the hospital to go home... Seriously feel like I've left something?'

Referring to the team talk given by the Warrington Wolves head
coach he said: 'Tony Smith did say in his pre match team 
talk last night "your balls are on the line here guys!" I didn't think
he meant literally'.

The father-of-two has not yet announced whether he intends to carry on playing. Other rugby players who have lost testicles have chosen to retire over fears they may lose the other.

Scottish rugby Union international Anthony 'Budge' Poutney decided to throw in the towel at the age of 29 after enduring a similar injury during match in 2003.

Mr Wood could have expected a little sympathy from his team mates but he was mercilessly ribbed online about the missing appendage which he suffered with unbelievable good grace.

He said: 'All the jokes have come out today about my 'nuts' 'balls' 'bo***ks' Good job I can take a laugh! I could of easily got a complex haha.'
