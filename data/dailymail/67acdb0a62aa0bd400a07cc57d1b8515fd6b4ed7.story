If you thought chocolate body paint was all naff Secret Santa presents and tacky sex shops, think again.

A luxury erotic emporium, which gained notoriety for their BDSM boxes worth up to £1,000, have now brought out another extravagant product for the bedroom.

BXG's Body Paint contains all the ingredients found in a premium box of chocolates to suit chocolate fetishists with finer taste.

Developed with master chocolatiers
Cocomaya, the sensual liquid 
chocolate contains the highest quality Valrhona hazelnut praline 
(60 per cent), Valrhona cocoa powder and organic rapeseed oil.

BXG Body Paint: It's chocolate body paint, but not as you know it

They launched their paint at London Ink star and A-list tattoo artist Dan Gold's new 
art exhibition 'Head' at London's The Sanctum hotel on Thursday.

There, a pretty blonde model named Jen Goodall had the 
pleasure of acting as a human canvas for him as he painted her back into an illustrated design using the contents of the sweet-tasting jars.

Jen, who also 
features in model images on the BXG Collection website, wore Lascivious Lingerie and 
specially created Chrome Leather Mask and Cuffs by Tamzin Lillywhite to the launch, 
which may feature in future collaborations with Sanctum Hotel.

'It was a sensual experience,' said Jen.

'Dan
was continuously asking if I was okay. I felt like asking him the same 
question. His masterpiece on my back was a success and the only 
frustration was not being able to eat the gorgeous tasting chocolate 
afterwards,' she said.

'The
launch at the Sanctum offered an amazing mix of sensuality and artistry
which is what BXG is all about. The new BXG Body Paint is all that in a
jar.

'BXG Body Paint, 
which was formulated in Cocomaya's chocolate studio in London's Connaught 
Street, has been months in preparation to get the flavour and 
consistency just right. 

'The taste is incredible: bitter and sweet at the same time with a real kick because of the high cocoa content,' said Lara.

'The premium French praline was chosen for its quality and high hazelnut content.

'The ingredients carefully combined with Valrhona cocoa powder create the perfect harmony between the cocoa flavour and nutty tones,' said Lara.

The first batch of Body Paint to be released will be limited edition jars by Dan Gold - each a one off piece available at bxgcollection.com and at the MOAS Gallery in London.

BXG 'offers a blank canvas for every fantasy' and their new delicious product will be part of a Curate Your Own experience and the soon-to-be-launched new box collection.

'BXG is about creating your own sexual picnic 
from an array of luxury goods and liquid chocolate in a jar has to be 
the perfect condiment,' said Lara.

'Body paint is traditionally made with sickly sweet syrupy ingredients - not much cocoa. 

'I love the concept of sex, chocolate 
and art and by collaborating with Cocomaya and Dan Gold, who painted
the limited edition jars, we’ve got it all.'

One 228ml jar costs £42.50 or £92.50 with the luxury leather cuffs, from bxgcollection.com.
