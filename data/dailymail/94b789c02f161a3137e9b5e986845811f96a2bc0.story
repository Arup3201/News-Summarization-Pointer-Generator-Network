The famously loud mouthed model, Janice Dickinson is hardly a shrinking violet but has the shameless American gone too far this time?

The world's first supermodel had her 'sagging' 30-year-old boob job updated as part of E!'s new surgery programme Botched.

The 59-year-old star decided that her breasts needed more surgery after they 'rippled' and were beginning to show their age with signs of sagging.

Too much information? Janice Dickinson had her 30-year-old implants updated on Botched, a new TV show starting on E!

Many doctors would have deemed Janice's botched boob job 'unfixable' but in the IN new series doctors tackle surgery mishaps and mistakes that other medical experts have dismissed.

Janice is no stranger to surgery having had a facelift, browlift, breast augmentation, tummy tuck and fillers however, the ex-model said that her botched boob job had not put her off more surgery.

Of her previous breast surgery she said: 'Sylvester Stallone paid for those, so I figured why not?'

Demanding: Dr Terry Dubrow says that Janice was one of the most difficult patients he had ever had

Recovered addict, Janice, really struggled with her sobriety during the procedure

Janice consulted plastic surgeons Dr Paul Nassif and Dr Terry Dubrow (Dubrow is a fixture on The Real Housewives of Beverely Hills) of Botched when fixing her sagging breasts.

Shortly after her first procedure Janice had noticed some 'rippling' occuring around the edge of her implants. Janice's breast implants were over 30-years-old well exceeding doctor's recomendations to have implants replaced every 10-15 years.

According to Pagesix.com Dr Terry Dubrow was in shock with Janice's behaviour on the show.

Dr Terry Dubrow was extremely concerned about Janice's demands for drugs whilst she was in the hospital

Shameless? The entirety of Janice's procedure was filmed for the new programme

'In my 25 years of being a board-certified plastic surgeon, Janice is by far the most difficult patient I have ever had,' Dubrow confesses. 'She is her breasts’ worst enemy.'

During the programme Dubrow shows concerns for Janice's insisting on more pain killers, pointing out that after three days in the hospital most people would be on aspirin.

'I don’t give a s*** about most people' is Janice's response which prompts Dubrow to question Janice's sobriety referring to her drug-fueled past.

'The ex-addict is coming out,' the doctor explains 'We've got post-operative pain management problems … This is classic drug-seeking behavior.'

Janice returns for another check-up, where she reveals she has no recollection of the previous week and is unaware as to whether she broke her sobreity or not.

Six weeks following the operation Janice shows off her newly healed breasts in her photo shoot for her skincare line.
