Hammer attack: Police have released this e-fit of a man who attacked a 26-year-old with a hammer

Police have issued an e-fit of a man they want to speak to after a pedestrian was hit repeatedly with a hammer by an attacker who jumped out of a bush.

The 26-year-old man was left with severe injuries in the unprovoked attack in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex on March 24.

The attacker was white, about 40 and over six foot tall with untidy brown hair.

He was slim with hunched over shoulders and had very drawn cheeks. Police said he walked with a distinctive stagger.

The victim was taken to hospital after the attack, though his injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.

Police initially believed the attack was part of an attempted theft. 

Detective Constable Nick O'Shaughnessy said: 'This appears to be totally unprovoked.

'We need to find anyone who recognises the description of the attacker or the face from the e-fit so that we can trace this man.'

'If you have any idea who the man is or where he could be, please contact us.

'Anyone who recognises him or has any information is asked to contact detectives on 101 or email 101@sussex.pnn.police.uk quoting serial 1049 24/3. They can also call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.'
