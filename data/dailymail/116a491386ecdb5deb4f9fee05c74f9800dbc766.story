North Korean leader Kim Jong-un must face international justice for human rights abuses committed by the state that are comparable to atrocities committed in the Nazi era, a UN investigator said today.

Marzuki Darusman, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea, said there was enough evidence of systematic torture, starvation and killings, to hold the isolated country's leader accountable.

A UN inquiry concluded in a February 17 report that North Korean security chiefs and possibly even Kim himself should face international justice for ordering 'massive' human rights atrocities - including torture and starvation.

Mr Darusman told a forum in Seoul that the report 'was able to point unequivocally to the responsibility and the culpability (for) these massive human rights violations to a single source of policy decision-making in the country.

'And therefore it's only now that we are in the position to in fact directly put culpability on the supreme leader for these massive human rights violations.'

A resolution drafted by the European Union and Japan has urged North Korea's referral to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity - but it does not single Kim out by name.

North Korea has dismissed the UN inquiry as part of an American plot aimed at destroying the country's political system. 

In recent months, the country's diplomats have also been on a vigorous campaign to counter the moves to drag North Korea to the ICC.

Mr Darusman added: 'That, perhaps, has somewhat agitated the North Korean delegation.'

The draft resolution could go to a UN General Assembly committee that deals with human rights as early as next week.

If approved, it will be put to a vote at the General Assembly in December.

Only the 15-member Security Council can refer the situation in North Korea to the ICC, but diplomats say China, North Korea's main benefactor, would likely veto such a move.

Recently, it was reported that Kim had ordered one of his top military officials be shot by firing squad for changing the words of a socialist anthem when singing karaoke.

He was said to be furious after learning the man had changed the lines 'thanks to our party' to 'thanks to your party' and 'Hate your enemies, love your country,' to 'Hate your wife, love your mistress'.

The move was considered a sign of a rebellious spirit and the man was dragged out of his home and put to death by firing squad the next day. 

It was also revealed that other former military leaders had suffered death by firing squad after they were caught watching Western soap operas.
