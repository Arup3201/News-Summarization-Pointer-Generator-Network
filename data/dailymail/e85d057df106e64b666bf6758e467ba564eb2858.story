A former-Philadelphia man received a $490,000 settlement after he claims cops took him on an abusive ride in a police van and left him with a broken neck.

James McKenna, 36, said that off-duty police officers told their colleagues to 'f*** this guy up' after calling those on-duty to arrest McKenna for 'belligerent' conduct outside a Center City bar in June 2011. 

James McKenna, 36, said that after being dangerously tossed around four times in the back of the police van, he could't 'muster up the strength' to get up

McKenna underwent surgery and was hospitalized for 11 days after the incident left him with hree broken neck vertebrae and two ruptured neck disks

McKenna told the Philadelphia Inquirer that the officers tossed him into a police van that sped along then came to abrupt stops knocking McKenna to the floor until his neck was broken.

McKenna was handcuffed but unrestrained in the vehicle. 

'I went down two or three times,' McKenna told the Inquirer. After the fourth fall, McKenna said, he couldn't get up.

'I couldn't muster the strength.' 

Hospital records obtained by the Inquirer appear to partially confirm McKenna's claims stating: 'While being transported, [patient] hit his own head against divider as reported by arriving officers' and 'hit head on police car door.'

Police involved reportedly said that McKenna was drunk and belligerent and he injured himself by banging his head against cell bars.

However, the Inquirer reports that McKenna's lawyer, Thomas J. Gibbons, presented a doctor's expert opinion as part of the lawsuit in which the doctor said that McKenna's injuries were far too serious to have been self-inflicted.

McKenna has since moved to Quincy, Mass. telling the Inquirer that he no longer feels safe in Philadelphia 

The  officers involved consistently denied being at fault for McKennas injuries and claim McKenna was drunk and caused harm to himself.

Police say they arrested McKenna after he drunkenly punched a bartender. McKenna denies that saying the officer attacked him from behind because he didn't like how McKenna spoke to a woman at the bar. 

Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey repeatedly denied to comment on the issue, according to the Inquirer.

The police vans have seat belts that prisoners are expected to hold on to during the ride. McKenna was handcuffed but unrestrained in the vehicle and was tossed to the ground multiple times.

McKenna's suit lists three broken neck vertebrae and two ruptured neck disks as McKenna's injuries. 

He reportedly spent 11 days in the hospital and underwent surgery, but still suffers from limited mobility in his left arm and hand, according to the Inquirer.

'This settlement is a vindication for him,' Gibbons told the Inquirer Tuesday. The city agreed to pay the settlement in order to resolve a suit brought by McKenna more than two years ago.

McKenna has since moved to Quincy, Massachusetts, telling the Inquirer that he no longer feels safe in Philadelphia. 

The vehicle's restraining belts are a recent change to the wagon, the Inquirer reports. The change came following a 2001 investigation of abusive rides in the wagons as a witness-free way for police officers to punish suspects.
