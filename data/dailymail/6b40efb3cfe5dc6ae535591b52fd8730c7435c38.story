Clashes have escalated in eastern Ukraine after dozens of rebel fighters surrounded and stormed the separatist headquarters in Donetsk, in the most serious case of insurgent infighting seen so far. 

Pro-Russian forces from the Vostok Battalion broke through the regional government building and demanded activists from the so-called People's Republic of Donetsk - which was set up in April - leave the premises.

The insurgents then arrested members of the rival group, before removing their flags from check-points in the area.

Members of the Vostok Battalion, a pro-Russia militia, today surrounded separatist headquarters in the eastern Ukrainian 
city of Donetsk,  in what is believed to be the most serious case of insurgent infighting to date

The standoff was allegedly started amid reports of looting from a supermarket near the airport, which the Vostok Battalion allege was carried out by their allies.

The supermarket was near to the site where dozens of militiamen - mainly from the Vostok Battalion - were killed on Monday.

Today's confrontation ended with the militiamen seizing the looted goods and 
bulldozing the barricades that have lined the building since the People's Republic was created.

The latest clashes come after a Ukrainian military helicopter was shot 
down by rebels over Slovyansk earlier today, killing 14 troops on board,
 including a general.

Pro-Russian forces removed flags of other separatist groups from the 
barricades outside the Donetsk regional administration building, where the so-called People's Republic of Donetsk has been based since April

The forces moved the flags after surrounding and storming the building, in a bid to eject the group from the premises, amid rumours of looting at a supermarket near the airport on Monday

Acting President Oleksandr Turchynov told
 the parliament in Kiev that insurgents used a portable air defense 
missile to down the helicopter.

He said: 'I have just received 
information that terrorists using Russian anti-aircraft missiles shot 
down our helicopter near Slovyansk. It had been ferrying servicemen for a change of duty.'

Turchynov said army General Serhiy Kulchytskiy was among the dead.

The Interfax news agency said 
Kulchytskiy had once served in the Soviet army and was in charge of 
combat training for Ukraine's National Guards.

The standoff was said to be the result of alleged looting from a supermarket near the airport, which the Vostok Battalion say was carried out by their allies

Gunshots
 were heard in Slovyansk near the crash site and a Ukrainian air force 
jet was seen circling above. It was too dangerous to visit the site 
itself.

Turchynov said 
the helicopter was flying troops in for a rotation to a hill outside 
Slovyansk where Ukrainian forces have set up positions.

The confrontation ended with the militiamen seizing the allegedly looted
 goods and bulldozing the barricades that have lined the building since 
early April, when the People's Republic announced its formation

A separatist spokesman had earlier 
told Russian news agencies that the militants had downed the helicopter 
in a fierce battle that was still raging on the southern outskirts of 
the rebel-controlled city.

The unnamed spokesman said that 'as a result of active military activities, several houses belonging to civilians caught fire'.

The
 death toll is one of the highest suffered by Ukrainian forces since the
 separatist insurgency first erupted in eastern Ukraine in early April.

The downing of the Mi-8 helicopter is a major blow for Kiev whose new president Petro Poroshenko is to be inaugurated within days.

He plans a first meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the D-Day commemorations in Normandy on June 6.

But he is also to demand military protection from the U.S. and major European states, in a move that - if accepted - risks pulling the West into conflict with Russia.

Poroshenko said he could no longer trust Russia, adding: 'We need a new defence alliance with the United States and Europe to protect Ukraine militarily'.

It also emerged that 33 men killed in bloody battles in Donetsk were Russian citizens, giving backing to Ukraine's claims that Moscow's blatant interference is fuelling the conflict.

Ukraine premier Arseniy Yatsenyuk said the 'escalating' unrest would stop immediately if Russia stopped supporting the rebels.

'If Russia stays out, we will resolve the east Ukraine situation within a week or two,' he said.

'So far, tensions are escalating in the Ukrainian east,' Yatsenyuk stressed.

Russia called on the West  'to stop Ukraine from descending into a national disaster' with one report saying the flare-up in trouble had delayed Russian troop redeployment from border areas, with intelligence-gathering units remaining in place.

'The international community awaits from Kiev an immediate ceasing of military activities in the east of the country and the withdrawal of troops. Without that, achieving peace in Ukraine is impossible.'

Moscow claimed the Ukraine onslaught counted children and the elderly among its victims.

Russia expressed 'deep concern over the further escalation of the situation in eastern Ukraine'.

Slovyansk has become the epicentre of fighting between pro-Russia insurgents and government forces in recent weeks.

The
 city, located 100 miles west of the Russian border, has seen constant 
clashes and its residential areas have regularly come under mortar 
shelling from government forces, prompting some residents to flee.

The Kiev government condemns the 
insurgency roiling the east as the work of 'terrorists' bent on 
destroying the country and blames Russia for fomenting it.

Russia
 denies the accusations, saying it has no influence over rebels, who 
insist they are only protecting the interests of the Russian-speaking 
population of the east.

Still,
 fighters from Russia, including the battled-hardened region of 
Chechnya, have been appearing recently in the ranks of the separatists.

In Donetsk, another embattled city in the east, pro-Russian rebels have reportedly executed two people for looting after declaring martial law.

Separatist
 gunmen from the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic have imposed a
 strict curfew in the city as both the insurgents and civilians braced 
themselves for a full-scale government assault.

Reports last night suggested Kiev had sent armoured vehicles to the city, a move which came hours after Ukraine's 
president-elect promised a tough crackdown to flush out the separatists.

With the city
 in lockdown, a street commander who called himself 'Dollar' defied 
anyone to break the curfew, which runs from 8pm to 6am each day.

'We
 will probably simply detain you,' he told The Times after pulling up in
 a black Skoda accompanied by a car with gunmen carrying automatic 
weapons.

'We aren't Germans, we won’t kill you immediately.'

The
 Times reported that a dozen rebel fighters nervously manned a 
checkpoint on the outskirts of the city, on several occasions running 
for cover and training their weapons at vehicles.

Meanwhile,
 a pro-Russian rebel leader today said his fighters are holding four 
international monitors in Ukraine - but said they might be set free 
soon.

Vyacheslav 
Ponomarev, the self-proclaimed 'people's mayor' of Slovyansk, a city in 
the Donetsk region, insisted the observers from the Organisation for 
Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) were safe.

He did not set any conditions for their release, according to the Interfax news agency.

'They were most zealous': Vyacheslav Ponomarev, the self-proclaimed 'people's mayor' of Slovyansk, said his fighters are holding four international monitors but said they might be set free soon

The OSCE said it had lost contact with one of its four-man monitoring teams in Donetsk on Monday evening.

Rebels have previously kidnapped OSCE monitors in Ukraine.

Ponomarev
 said that his men had advised OSCE monitors not to travel across the 
region, but 'there were those four most-zealous ones, and they were 
detained.'

The OSCE 
monitors have been deployed to Ukraine to monitor the security situation
 following Russia's annexation of Crimea and a pro-Russia separatist 
insurgency that has engulfed regions in eastern Ukraine.

They also observed Sunday's presidential vote, won by billionaire candy magnate Poroshenko.

Poroshenko has promised to negotiate with people in the east, where insurgents have seized government buildings and fought government troops for a month-and-half.

But he also vowed to continue a military operation to uproot the armed rebels and bring it to a quick end.

In the most furious battle yet, rebels in Donetsk tried to take control of its airport Monday, but were repelled by Ukrainian forces using combat jets and helicopter gunships. Dozens of men were killed and some morgues were overflowing Tuesday.

Some insurgent leaders said up to 100 fighters may have been killed.
