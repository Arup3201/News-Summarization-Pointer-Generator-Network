With his mother's trademark pout on his face, Brooklyn Beckham makes his modelling debut aged 15.

The teenager appears on the cover of Man About Town magazine and while he poses just like his mum Victoria - he looks the spitting image of his handsome soccer star dad David in the black and white photo shoot which evokes the old Hollywood images of a young James Dean.

The pictures were taken by photographer Alasdair McLellan, who shot Victoria for UK Vogue and David for Fantastic Man, and is a 'friend of the family'.

Man About Town magazine, a biannual publication, says it is 'targeted at high-end business-engaged and culturally-orientated male urbanities... giving a guide to the seasonal men must haves.'

Brooklyn follows in the footsteps of his younger brother Romeo, 11, who had a starring role in a Burberry campaign in December 2012.

And just like his famous parents, it seems that Brooklyn's also a dedicated follower of fashion as he's pictured wearing labels including Ralph Lauren, Saint Laurent and Supreme.

The dashing teen appears on the cover wearing a quiff and a navy blue bomber jacket and tie - while the word 'Quiche' is emblazoned on the front of the magazine, referring to the new term for 'hot' coined by Australian comic Chris Lilley in his hit HBO series, Ja'mie: Private School Girl.

A source told MailOnline: 'David and Victoria are immensely proud of all their children, and they never push them into anything even though the boys get lots of offers.

'Brooklyn is focused on school and soccer, but of course he was so excited to get his first magazine cover shoot as he's interested in photography like his dad.

'The photo shoot was shot over a weekend and all the family went along to support Brooklyn.'

Man About Town Editor-in-Chief Ben Reardon said: 'We are thrilled to feature Brooklyn Beckham in a world exclusive on the cover of the Spring/Summer 2014 issue of Man About Town.

'Brooklyn's first published editorial is a 20-page fashion story celebrating teenage style, which shows a warm and honest insight into the moment men begin to express themselves through clothes.

'We could not have wished for a stronger
 subject than Brooklyn to bring this story to life. He was a diligent, 
relaxed cover star for his first ever fashion shoot.

'The story was a genuine pleasure for 
all involved. Brooklyn was a true professional and had a keen eye in the
 styling process, collaborating on selections from designers including 
Ralph Lauren, Saint Laurent and Supreme.

'It is clear that he is becoming
 a credit to the family name, not only possibly the most famous in the 
world but one with a wealth of heavyweight fashion influence behind it.'

Brooklyn is believed to have his inherited his dad's talent for soccer - and his passion for the game.

Last October, he was seen training at his father's old club, Manchester United - where David made his career after signing up for the youth team aged 16 - but was NOT trying out for a contract with the club, according to sources.

Brooklyn has also had trials at Chelsea in January 2013 and has been training with Queens Park Rangers' academy.

He is now at school in London, where the Beckhams moved after David retired from professional soccer.

The teenager was seen jetting into Los Angeles with his mum and brother Cruz, eight, toting sister Harper, two, in his arms on Friday night.

Speaking about her children, fashion designer Victoria said: 'They lead a very privileged life but they don’t get everything they ask for. We always tell them how lucky they are.'
