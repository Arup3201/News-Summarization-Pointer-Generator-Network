A pensioner left on her own while her daughter was away on holiday died after contracting food poisoning from an undercooked chicken kiev.

Dorothy Flannagan cooked herself a meal after she had food delivered to her home by a Tesco van.

But the 86-year-old grandmother started to suffer from sickness and diarrhoea the following day.

Doctors believed Mrs Flannagan's organs started to fail after she contracted campylobacter – the most common cause of food poisoning.

Tragically the retired club secretary died at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire on July 30.

Mrs Flannagan, who lived with her daughter Karen Kelly in Lightwood, Stoke-on-Trent, ordered a food delivery after her daughter went on holiday to Egypt in July last year.

Her other daughter Beverley Turner told an inquest in Stoke the delivery included two packets of pre-packed chicken kiev.

Mrs Turner, of Caverswall, Staffs, said: 'She had lived with my sister for 18 years. She was self-caring. She didn't need caring for but she had people staying with her while Karen was away.

'Nobody was with mum when she cooked her tea that night. She had previously cooked one in the microwave but I don't know how she cooked it that night. She had already had the chicken kiev when we got there that night.

In the UK, it is the most common bacterial cause of food poisoning.

Campylobacter bacteria are usually found on raw or undercooked meat (particularly poultry), unpasteurised milk, untreated water, chicken liver and liver pâté.

The time between eating contaminated food and the onset of symptoms for food poisoning caused by campylobacter is two to five days.

'The following day she became unwell. She had no energy and she wasn't making any sense.'

Medics initially put Mrs Flannagan's symptoms down to her diabetes and discharged her later that day.

But she was re-admitted to hospital the next day after her condition deteriorated.

Mrs Turner added: 'She was moved to a different ward where doctors told us that mum had campylobacter, which is highly associated with food poisoning, especially with chicken.'

A post mortem revealed the cause of death was acute kidney injury following campylobacter infection.

North Staffordshire's assistant coroner Margaret Jones recorded a conclusion of misadventure.

She said: 'She was living with her daughter but was able to cook for herself. While her daughter was away Mrs Flannagan cooked some chicken kiev.

Mrs Flannagan suffered from sickness, diarrhoea and her organs started to fail after contracting campylobacter, the most common cause of food poisoning. The retired club secretary died at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire (above) on July 30

'We know she had previously cooked this in a microwave and we know she had two lots of chicken in the house, but she had consumed only one.

'She was very much under the watchful eye of all of her family and in a short space of time she became very unwell indeed. She was admitted to hospital and her illness was diagnosed. It was a particular bacteria associated with food poisoning.'

The assistant coroner added: 'Mrs Flannagan cooked the chicken and she had probably not cooked it as well as she could have, but she cooked it herself and it's highly likely that these two things are very much related.'
