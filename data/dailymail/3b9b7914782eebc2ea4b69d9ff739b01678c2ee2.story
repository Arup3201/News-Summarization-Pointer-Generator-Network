A senior surgeon has been banned from operating at a children’s heart unit facing closure after it was condemned for excessive death rates.

The consultant surgeon at Leeds Children’s Hospital last week agreed not to conduct any more procedures until concerns raised about ‘aspects of his practice’ were investigated.

The hospital, already earmarked to lose its cardiac surgery department under an NHS review, last night refused to name the surgeon – one of only four in the cardiac department – and had released no public information about his agreement to cease surgery until contacted by The Mail on Sunday. A spokesman said it had a ‘duty as an employer’ not to name the surgeon.

Crisis: Leeds hospital is already earmarked to lose its cardiac surgery unit

Last year, the Children’s Heart Federation said it had ‘major concerns’ about standards of care at Leeds, claiming some babies had been sent home to die and called for an investigation following feedback from parents.

The safety of children’s heart surgery at Leeds was also raised two years ago with the Care Quality Commission health watchdog when a report found there had been 20 ‘excess’ or unexpected deaths over eight years to 2008.

Hospital bosses stressed the new concerns were not related to mortality or morbidity figures or the row over transferring patients. But they admitted the consultant was already under an earlier restriction from carrying out certain procedures.

In a statement, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said: ‘A surgeon in our paediatric cardiac team has agreed not to carry out operations until we have completed an assessment of aspects of his surgical practice. He has been subject to a specific restriction on his practice over a period of time and we review the position on a regular basis.

‘This professional review is being carried out within the trust. It is viewed as best practice and is part of running a safe service.’

Leeds is one of three children’s heart units to be closed after a review in the wake of the Bristol heart scandal in the Nineties in which 35 babies died and dozens more were left brain-damaged. It sparked a sea change in the way mortality rates in hospitals are monitored, especially in cardiac care.

In recent months, a huge legal campaign, backed by publicity, has been mounted to keep heart surgery at Leeds following last year’s Safe and Sustainable NHS review, which recommended all surgery be transferred to better-equipped Newcastle.

The campaign won the first round of a High Court judicial review, which found parts of the NHS consultation had been ‘flawed’. The NHS vowed to continue the closure plans, though another court hearing is due this week.

Last night there were calls for operations at Leeds to be suspended to protect children from sub-standard surgery. One leading paediatric cardiologist said: ‘We don’t want another Bristol where all those children lost their lives. There should be decisive action as there was when there similar problems at Oxford in 2010. Then they just stopped doing surgery and it never resumed.’

A senior expert on children’s heart surgery last night said Leeds General Infirmary ‘ought to put the safety of children first’.

He said: ‘When we were looking at the reorganisation of children’s heart surgery nationally, Leeds was bottom of the table. If there have been two incidents where surgeons have had stop performing certain operations, it would suggest there are serious issues that need addressing.

'Our number one priority has to be the children needing heart surgery. And they should be getting the best care possible, however far they have to travel to get it.’

The adviser, who worked for former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, said: ‘We have been trying to reorganise children’s heart surgery for four years and are still unable to implement our plans because of campaigns like the one in Leeds. Based on the inspection reports of the various centres, Leeds did not do very well. The case for keeping paediatric surgery at Leeds is an emotional one.

‘One can understand support for a local centre, where some children have done well, but overall, looking at the interests of all patients, Leeds does not meet the standard.

‘On clinical outcomes, they are misguided. What the campaigners have to think about is all results, not individual personal experiences.’

The reorganisation of paediatric heart surgery has been delayed for many years following publication of the Kennedy Report into the Bristol Heart Babies scandal.

Although that report led to the raising of standards, the spread of services over 14 centres is thought to have resulted in children being at risk from surgeons inexperienced in certain types of surgery. Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS Medical Director, said five years ago it would be a ‘stain on the profession’ if paediatric heart surgery wasn’t reorganised.
