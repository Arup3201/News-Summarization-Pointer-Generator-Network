A couple only a year from their 50th wedding anniversary were killed while driving home from church after a U.S. Army private traveling the wrong way down a one-way street plowed into their car earlier this month.

Teddy and Mary Ann Allison, 67 and 71 respectively, had just left Friendship Assembly of God Church on August 12 when their white Saturn was rammed by a Chevy Malibu driven by Pvt. 1st Class Khalil Sanders.

The couple were taken to hospital in Colorado Springs, Denver in critical condition. Mr Allison, a retired Hewlette 
Packard electronics technician died on August 15. His 
wife passed away three days later.

A long life together: Teddy and Mary Ann Allison had visited 49 states and every province in Canada. Mary Ann was an avid speed walker and Teddy a runner and biker. They met in Kansas and settled in Colorado Springs

Deadly Crossroads: Pvt. 1st Class Khalil Sanders of Fort Carson was driving the wrong way on Sawyer Way while the Allisons headed south on Murray Boulevard when their cars impacted

Pvt Sanders, 18, is reportedly a member of the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 4th Infantry Division at nearby Fort Carson.

He joined the Army in November 2011 and was assigned to Fort Carson in May, according to the Gazette of Colorado Springs.

Sanders has not yet been charged as the Colorado Springs Police Department continues to investigate the incident, a U.S. Army spokesman told MailOnline on Tuesday night.

The spokesman added that Sanders is from Detroit, and was yet to be be deployed overseas.

'No one ever thinks it will happen in their family,' Stan Allison, the couple's son reportedly said.

'Being 67 and 71, they were so healthy that, for them, it seems pretty young.

'It’s hard to say, but we think it’s better for them that they died together.

'They had been together for so long that it would have been hard for one to live without the other.”

The Allisons had met in Tribune, Kansas and later moved to Colorado Springs, where they lived for the rest of their lives.

The pair, Stan Allison told The Gazette, were avid travelers who had visited 49 U.S. states and all the provinces in Canada.

Teddy Allison was reportedly an avid runner and biker and Mary Ann Allison was a speed walker.

“She could walk anyone into the ground,” Stan Allison told The Gazette with a chuckle.

Along with their son, they are survived by a daughter Stacy Schaut who lives in Loveland.

A Fateful Meeting: Sanders was assigned to 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 4th Infantry Division. The Allisons, meanwhile, died three days apart from each other in mid-August
