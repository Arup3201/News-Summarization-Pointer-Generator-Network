UK Vogue editor: Alexandra Shulman said readers can look in the mirror and get the real thing 'for free'

The UK Vogue editor has argued against putting ‘real people’ on the cover of her magazine - because readers can look in the mirror and get the real thing ‘for free’.

Alexandra Shulman, who has edited the publication since 1992, also said she was ‘fed up’ of questions about thin models and the fashion industry.

She said: ‘People always say “why do you have thin models? That’s not what real people look like.” But nobody really wants to see a real person looking like a real person on the cover of Vogue.

‘I think Vogue is a magazine that’s all about fantasy to some extent and dreams, and an escape from real life.

‘People don’t want to buy a magazine like Vogue to see what they see when they look in the mirror. They can do that for free.’

The editor was interviewed on BBC Radio 2 by singer Lily Allen, who has previously spoken out against the media and fashion industries causing negative body image among women.

On Vogue and the fashion industry, Ms Shulman said: ‘I guess a certain amount of defending comes with the job. The magazine does really well, so obviously some people like it and it’s not a real problem.

‘I get fed up with having to deal with the question of why are models thin, that sort of bores me, but that’s the only thing really.

‘I do think designers should cut bigger and use bigger models on the catwalk. I’ve said it again and again. But there is much more diversity than there used to be, it is changing.’

She also described the Vogue cover images that sell the most copies, adding that the most popular ones were ‘broadly speaking…quite a middle view of what beauty is.

'Quite conventional, probably smiling, in a pretty dress; somebody looking very “lovely”. The most perfect girl next door.’

Next month’s cover star is Nigella Lawson, whose photographs were praised for their natural look. The popular TV chef appears on the front of April Vogue virtually make-up free.
