Blackburn Rovers manager Gary Bowyer has emerged as a surprise contender for the QPR job.

Caretaker boss Chris Ramsey remains favourite to land the post after No 1 target Michael Laudrup made clear his intention to remain in Qatar with Lekhwiya.

But Sportsmail understands QPR owner Tony Fernandes has been impressed by what Bowyer has done on limited budget in the wake of Steve Kean's disastrous tenure at Ewood Park.

Blackburn finished eighth in the Championship last season and currently sit ninth in the table.

The Blackburn job is Bowyer's first full-time managerial post having twice been caretaker at Ewood Park before his appointment in May 2013.

Fernandes is due in London next week in an attempt to finalise the appointment of Harry Redknapp's successor as the Rs bid to avoid relegation.

Ramsey's did his chances of landing the full-time job no harm with victory over Sunderland on Tuesday night. The three points were QPR's first away from home this season.
