Will Real Madrid retain the Champions League?

Carlo Ancelotti probably thought a crazy Saturday was just about over when he entered the room for his post-match press conference.

But with the Italian boss blissfully unaware, a host of Real Madrid players ran into the room to chant songs and dance after their Champions League victory.

Madrid beat City rivals Atletico in Lisbon on Saturday night, courtesy of goals from Sergio Ramos, Gareth Bale, Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo.

And while Ancelotti usually doesn't give anything away, he reverted away from his calm demeanor to egg on his jubilant players.

Goalscorers Ramos and Marcelo lead the invasion, with other schemers Luka Modric, Sami Khedira, Pepe and Isco also heavily involved.

The celebrations carried way into the night around Lisbon, with fans finally able to conquer La Decima, their tenth Champions League.

Real won't be forgetting their evening at the Estadio da Luz in a hurry.
