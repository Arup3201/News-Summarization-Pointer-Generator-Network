From bunnies to fluffy baby chicks, Easter is synonymous with all things cute. But while chocolate Easter eggs are a relatively modern phenomenon, as these stunning vintage cards reveal, an appreciation for all things adorable is not.

The Easter cards, which date from the early years of the 20th century, are festooned with delicately drawn rabbits, multicoloured chickens and rosy-cheeked cherubs galore.

Others feature traditional Spring motifs such as daffodils and chicks, while more still include vividly coloured Easter eggs - not all of which are of the chocolate variety.

Cracking: An rosy-faced cherub crawls out of an Easter Egg in this eye-catching card. Sadly, little angels such as this one are rarely spotted on modern cards

They blight the land and have caused chaos on farms, so it's no wonder Australians have chosen to swap bunnies for bilbies.

First introduced in 1968, the Easter Bilby comes in chocolate form and decorates festive packaging.

Originally intended to raise awareness of the endangered marsupial, bilbies are a firm favourte of Australian children come Easter.

Although the origins of Easter are firmly rooted in Christianity, not every creature to appear on the cards can say the same. The Easter Bunny, for example, was associated with the Saxon goddess Ēostre and has its roots in pre-Christian festivities laid on to welcome the Spring Equinox.

The exchange of Easter eggs also pre-dates Christianity, with elaborately decorated ostrich eggs discovered in 60,000-year-old African burial sites while 5000-year-old eggs made from gold and silver unearthed in the graves of ancient Sumerians and Egyptians.

In Greece, the only eggs available are red-painted chicken eggs, some of which also bear a gold cross, and commemorate the early Christians of Mesopotamia who dyed eggs blood red to mark Jesus' sacrifice.

But eggs and rabbits aren't the only way to celebrate Easter. Around the world, a variety of different customs have been adopted to mark the big day, with everything from whipping to iguana suppers included.

In Colombia, the traditional Easter lunch includes roasted iguana and turtles, while women in Hungary risk being splashed with lucky water as they celebrate the big day.

Traditional: The image of three angels holding an Easter Greetings banner is a much more traditional card that reflects the religious roots of the festival

Other unusual traditions include a fertility ritual unique to the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which sees women submit to being whipped with willow switches in the belief it makes them more beautiful and promotes fertility.

An altogether more British tradition is that of the hot cross bun; a part of national life for more than two millennia and which, according to Anglo-Saxon chronicler, Bede, is linked to the goddess, Ēostre - the deity who also gave Easter its name.

Once a year-round treat, in 1592 the London Clerk of Markets proclaimed that the buns could only be eaten on Good Friday, at Christmas and at funerals and their consumption was restricted further by James I.

Despite his best efforts, the bun remains popular today. Thought to bring good luck, according to traditional superstition, the bun should be kissed before being eaten and if shared with a friend, will cement the relationship for the year to come.
