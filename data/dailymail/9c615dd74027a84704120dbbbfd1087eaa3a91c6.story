Giant pandas are hogging the attention in the fight to protect species from extinction because they are cute and cuddly, even though they don't do much and show few signs of wanting to have babies.

That's according to the Ugly Animal Preservation Society, which is devoting itself to: 'raising the profile of some of Mother Nature’s more aesthetically challenged children'.

'We care so much about mammals — cute, furry, cuddly things,' Simon Watt, the society's president told The Times Cheltenham Science Festival.

The proboscis monkey is one of the endangered species ignored by conservationists because it is not as cute as the likes of giant pandas, says the Ugly Animals Preservation Society

The Myers' Surinam toad is under threat from the loss of its habit but its 'on the point of death looks' doesn't attract conservation support

'Pandas are all right. However, if we're
 only interested in those charismatic megafauna, we're going to leave 
our lives a lot more dull.'

The giant panda has been the logo of the World Wide Fund for Nature since the organisation was founded in 1961. Zoos around the world have breeding programs to encourage the creatures to get amorous, but often with little success.

Mr Watt highlighted the Myers' Surinam toad, which looks like it's been squashed in a road accident, in remarks at the festival, reported by the Times.

Even though the creature, found in a single province in Panama, is perfectly healthy, it looks 'on the point of death', he said.

Its population is under the same threat as the tiger, but the toad is not held in the same affections.

He pointed out that conservation was not a 'fun' task, with about 200 to 250 species becoming extinct every day.

The probiscis monkey, recognisable by
 its long nose, is suffering from a lack of attention because of its 
large hooter, despite being critically endangered.

Its home in Borneo, where it holds 
protected status, is gradually being destroyed - leading to a 50 per 
cent decrease in population in the last 40 years.

The Chinese giant salamander, the world's largest amphibian, was championed by scientist Jamie Gallagher at the festival.

'It has been ignored for a long time as people gradually eat the animal into extinction,' he said.

'South China has managed to eat its way through 75 per cent of the population.'

The Ugly Animal Preservation Society says the world would be a lot duller if only the cute animals were protected, instead of the likes of the Spanish Dancer sea slug

In January, the plight of the pubic 
louse was publicised when a Sydney's main sexual health clinic said it 
had not treated a case of crabs since 2008, and blame it on bikini waxing.

'It used to be extremely common; it’s 
now rarely seen,' said Basil Donovan, head of sexual health at the 
University of New South Wales’s Kirby Institute and a physician at the 
Sydney Sexual Health Centre.

'Without doubt, it’s better grooming.'

The Ugly Animals Preservation Society holds stand-up comedy events, with performers stating the case for an ugly and neglected species before the audience votes for their favourite.
