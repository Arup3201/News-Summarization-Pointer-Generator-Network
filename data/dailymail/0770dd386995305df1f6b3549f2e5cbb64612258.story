As part of the performance, two of the women marched towards the J-10 Fighter planes in unison with their five male counterparts, clad in matching green jumpsuits and aviation glasses. The ensemble matches those worn by the cast of the box-office smash hit  Top Gun, from 1986, which features Tom Cruise and Meg Ryan.

According to Chinese media reports, these are the first women to have joined the Bayi Aerobatic Team of the air force of the PLA, and they have trained meticulously in preparation for the event.

The women each have more than 750 hours of flying training under their belt, across the use of four different types of aircraft. The Chinese military have said that these are the only four women pilots in China capable of navigating the third generation of jet fighters now being used.

Tuesday marked the 65th anniversary of the inception of the Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. 

Also on display at the show are China's J-31 stealth aircraft, developed by the countries leader aircraft producer Aviation Industry Corp of China. The dual-engine jet, which conducted a demonstration but was not displayed afterwards, is pivotal to China's ability to advance into an offensively capable military.

The Chinese army, which is over 2.3 million-strong in size, has been increasing its defense budget for years, with an expected 12 per cent rise in budgeting to $132 billion in 2014. 

America has also accused China of under-reporting it's military expenditure by as much as 20 per cent in the past.
