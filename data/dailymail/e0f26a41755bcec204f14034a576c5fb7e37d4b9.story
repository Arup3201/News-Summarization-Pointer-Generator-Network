Two Marine generals have been fired over the security lapses that allowed 15 Taliban insurgents to infiltrate the NATO base in Afghanistan where Prince Harry was housed last September.

The attack claimed the lives of two U.S. Marines, including a Lieutenant Colonel, and destroyed six $24million Harrier jets and a C-130 transport plane - the largest single loss of American air power since the Vietnam War.

Major General Charles 'Mark' Gurganus, the commander of Regional Command Southwest in Afghanistan, and Major General Gregg Sturdevant, the commander of the Marines' aviation wing, have both been asked to retire, it was revealed today.

Target: The Taliban said that Prince Harry, who was stationed at Camp Bastion, was a target of the attackers

Marine Corps Commandant General James Amos demanded the resignation of the two commanders because they failed to ensure security at the base.

On September 14, 2012, 15 Taliban insurgents, dressed in U.S. military uniforms, slipped under a fence at the military outpost in Helmand Province.

Taliban propagandists said the Camp Bastion attackers intended to find and assassinate Prince Harry, who was living at the compound.

There have been conflicting reports as to whether Captain Wales, the fourth in line to the throne, was sent to a safe room or whether he was treated like any other soldier during the four-hour gun battle.

Prince Harry is the pilot of an Apache helicopter gunship.  

However, the team targeted numerous NATO aircraft, destroying or heavily damaging more than a dozen and causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.

Reliving the day: Details of the September 2012 raid were state secrets until now

USA Today reports that General Amos said : 'In their duty to protect their forces these two generals did not meet that standard.'

Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Raible, 40, was killed when he mustered a counter attack against the invaders and charged armed only with his sidearm.

Marine Sergeant Bradley Atwell, 27, was killed, as well. 

American Marines and members of the British Royal Air Force killed 14 of the attackers and captured one. 

General Gurganus was in charge of ensuring that the American aircraft were secure from assault. He requested more Marines for base security, but was denied.

Still, commanders say the general left base guard towers unoccupied and other defenses under-manned.

General Sturdevant was faulted for assuming other units would protect his aircraft wing and not setting up security measures of his own.
