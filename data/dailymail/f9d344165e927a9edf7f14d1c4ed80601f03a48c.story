Abby Huntsman has become the latest footnote in the long history of children of high-profile politicians becoming television news contributors.

The daughter of 2012 Republican presidential also-ran Jon Huntsman has inked a deal to become co-host of MSNBC’s ‘The Cycle.’

As Huntsman adds ‘a dose of moderate rational conservatism’ to the afternoon political talk show, she’ll join long list of politic kids turned media personalities that includes Chelsea Clinton, Jenna Bush, Meghan McCain, and more.

New gig: The daughter of Utah governor and presidential hopeful Jon Huntsman will now be seen on MSNBC's The Cycle

The Utah native, whose father ran the Beehive State prior to his presidential bid, announced her new gig on HuffPost Live, her most recent job.

The 27-year-old University of Pennsylvania grad was an original host and producer on the web-based show.

‘It’s this next chapter of my life, I’m very much looking forward to,’ she said on the live streaming show Wednesday. ‘It’s very bittersweet.’

Huntsman has also worked with ABC News and Good Morning America and appeared as a commentator on MSNBC and CNN since the 2012 elections.

Experienced: Abby Huntsman, 27, has worked with MSNBC before and will leave a job hosting Huff Post's live streaming web show to join The Cycle July 29

Since she comes complete with a history of working in the media, Huntsman will actually be among the more experienced of the elite group of political offspring turned media hosts.

At their start on television, names like Chelsea Clinton and Jenna Bush were familiar to viewers. But as subjects of the media, not producers of it.

Clinton notably faced scrutiny when it was announced in 2011 she’d be joining the NBC News team.

Though her job as a ‘special correspondent’ entailed little on-air time and no hard hitting subject matter, hardened media professionals were unimpressed.

Good company? Huntsman will join the ranks of Chelsea Clinton, who hosts the occasional segment for NBC News

Fellow journalist: Huntsman will also have a colleague in Meghan McCain, the daughter of Arizona Senator John McCain and contributor for MSNBC and the Daily Beast

‘Just another spoiled, aimless child of rich, successful parents,’ the New York Post’s Andrea Peyser wrote at the time, saying Clinton was ‘chauffeured through adulthood by Mommy and Daddy’s connections.’

Meanwhile, Jenna Bush was far more experienced as the butt of media jokes about her underage college drinking when she became a member of the media.

Meghan McCain might be a better parallel for Huntsman. The daughter of John McCain has contributed to MSNBC, as well, and written for the Daily Beast.

Someone to look up to? Liz Cheney is among the list, too. The daughter of former vice president Dick Cheney has been a common face seen on Fox News for years. Cheney recently announced a U.S. Senate bid

McCain’s reputation has largely been made on her ability to stir the press, albeit from the inside, than for her work.

Liz Cheney might be a comparison more to Huntsman’s liking.

The daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney has been a popular fixture on Fox News for years and recently announced her bid to run for U.S. Senate in Wyoming.

So, while we wait for her to come full circle and run for political office, viewers can catch Huntsman's time with MSNBC’s The Cycle starting July 29.
