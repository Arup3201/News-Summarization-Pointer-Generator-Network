Murdered: Mr Arun Kumar was stabbed inside his shop in Henderson, New Zealand, on Tuesday

Police have charged two boys, aged 12 and 13, over the fatal stabbing of a New Zealand grocery store owner.

Arun Kumar, 57, was murdered on Tuesday morning in a 'shocking' attack while working inside his shop with his wife.  

Police are describing the incident as an aggravated robbery, but say nothing was actually taken from the Railside Dairy and Grocery in Henderson, a major suburb of Auckland, New Zealand.

A boy, 13, was today charged with murder and his 12-year-old alleged accomplice charged with aggravated robbery.

'It is shocking to us that kids so young would be possibly involved,' Detective Inspector Bruce Scott said.

Mr Kumar died at the scene after reportedly being stabbed in the neck, despite paramedics performing first aid.

A local lawyer, Bernie Allen, told the New Zealand Herald that the shop owner and his wife were well known and much loved in the community.

'They were the most beautiful couple you could ever meet,' he said.

Detective Scott said: 'At about 7.30am this morning police were called to the Railside Dairy on Great North Road where it was reported that an aggravated robbery had taken place.'

'We don't know what they were targeting but we do know that nothing was actually taken from the shop. The wife, Mrs kumar, was also in the shop.

'All things considered obviously it's a terrible tragedy the family are completly shocked they are being supported by our victim support and by our ethnic liason officers,' he added.

Mystery: Police are unsure why Mr Kumar or his Railside Dairy shop (pictured) was targeted

Investigating: Police say they have gathered CCTV footage from the shop and are also looking at cameras from around Henderson's CBD

Mr Kumar's body will be taken for a post-mortem tomorrow.

However, they are also 'desperate' to speak to other people who were in the viccinity of Great North Road and the store at around 7.30am on Tuesday.
