A BBC newsreader was left red-faced last night after her bulletin began with an empty chair.

Martine Croxall was standing on the wrong side of the BBC News Channel studio for the start of her 9pm broadcast, with the cameras zooming into the seat after the titles at the top of the programme.

The 45-year-old presenter then told viewers that she was ‘just going to move back to the main set’ as she spent an awkward few seconds walking around the studio, before sitting down in her chair.

Oops: Newsreader Martine Croxall was standing on the wrong side of the BBC News Channel studio for the start of her 9pm broadcast last night

There's no-one there: The cameras zoomed into the empty seat after the titles at the top of the programme

Ahead of her introducing the top story about Lewis Hamilton winning his second Formula One world championship, she said: ‘Good evening and welcome to BBC News, I'm Martine Croxall.

‘It's nine o'clock. I'm just going to move back to the main set. I know this has happened before. Oh. But here we are. If I sidle in you can pretend that you haven't noticed. Here we are.’

Miss Croxall was referencing at least two previous cases of the BBC news beginning with an empty chair - the most recent of which happened last month when Joanna Gosling was presenting.

Miss Gosling was not seated as the camera cut to the office chair where she should have been on October 9, and soon the sound of footsteps and rustling paper could be heard out of shot.

Joking: Miss Croxall told viewers of the programme, 'if I sidle in you can pretend that you haven't noticed'

But as Miss Gosling sat down, around 30 seconds into the broadcast, she was cool personified - calmly apologising for a 'technical blip' and continuing as usual. 

And in July, the empty chair was seen again when presenter Nicholas Owen was seen standing by the studio's news wall as the cameras panned around the set, before sliding into shot and sitting down.

Miss Croxall, who lives in a £450,000 house in St Albans, Hertfordshire, with her husband Stephen, 43, is a mother and has worked for BBC News since 2001. She is originally from Leicestershire.

She once told in an interview of another embarrassing moment that saw her cause ear-splitting feedback by forgetting to switch off the speakers while trying to report live for BBC Radio Leicester.
