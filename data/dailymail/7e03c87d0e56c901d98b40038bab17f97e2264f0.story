He is perhaps best known for patrolling the beaches of Los Angeles and dishing out advice to Britain's Got Talent contestants.

But now David Hasselhoff is putting his unique talents to a completely different project - namely preserving the Berlin Wall.

The actor and singer has put his name behind a campaign to preserve one of the few remaining sections of the wall, calling it a 'sacred' monument.

Yesterday, the actor, best known for starring in 'Knight Rider' and 'Baywatch', joined ordinary Berliners in protesting a real estate developer's plans to move part of the wall to make way for an access path for a luxury housing development.

'It's like tearing down an Indian burial ground. It's a no-brainer,' said Hasselhoff.

The American won the hearts of many Germans for his schmaltzy hit 'Looking for Freedom', which was one of the soundtracks to their peaceful 1989 revolution.

He belted out the song to a million people on both sides of the wall during a New Year's Eve concert that year.

Plans to move part of the East Side 
Gallery - a three-quarter-of-a mile stretch of wall painted by artists 
after the fall of communism and popular with tourists - sparked angry 
protests earlier this month.

Activists have denounced it as part of a wider trend of steamrolling Berlin's tumultuous history to make way for gleaming but soulless developments in the heart of the city.

At least 136 people died between 1961 and 1989 trying to cross the wall that divided the communist-run East Berlin from West Berlin. Most of the wall has since been destroyed, with only two large sections remaining as memorials.

'This last piece of the wall is really sacred,' Hasselhoff said. 'It's about people and it's about hearts that were broken, hearts that were torn apart and lives that were lost. That's what we're talking about today, not a piece of real estate.' 

The Berlin Wall struck fear in the hearts of many Germans over almost three decades.

Construction of the wall by the German Democratic Republic began in August 1961.

Once completed, it completely cut off West Berlin from the surrounding East Germany and East Berlin.

Guard towers were located along concrete walls and it also contained anti-vehicle trenches.

According to the the Eastern Bloc the wall was built to protect the population from fascist elements who wanted to prevent the 'will of the people'.

However, in truth, the wall's purpose was to prevent the massive emigration and defection which marked Germany and the communist Eastern Bloc followed the Second World War.

Following a series of political changes in the Eastern Bloc in 1989 the East German government announced on November 9 that all its citizens could visit West Germany and West Berlin.

Huge crowds of people crossed and climbed on the wall in scenes which were previously unthinkable and were broadcast by television crews around the world.

By 1990, the wall itself was mainly destroyed. However, parts of it still remain in the city today.

Between 1961 and 1989, around 5,000 people attempted to escape over the wall, with an estimated death toll of over 600.

Asked if he thought his song had 
played any role in bringing down the most visible section of the Iron 
Curtain, Hasselhoff said: 'Whether it had anything to do with anything, 
it's a song about freedom and it stuck in their head because it had a 
good hook.'

Berliners can 
prepare for a reprise if talks involving the developers, authorities and
 campaigners fail to reach a compromise next week. 

'If it goes to the next step, we'll come back with a huge concert and really rock Berlin,' said `The Hoff.'

Roland Junge, one of thousands of 
locals who accompanied Hasselhoff on an impromptu walk along the wall 
yesterday, said: 'It's a stupid idea to rip parts of the 
wall out for luxury apartments.'
