From the tiger to the orangutan, Indonesia is home to some of the world’s most threatened animals.

And now the country’s highest Islamic body has issued a fatwa declaring that the hunting and trading of endangered species is immoral.

While many people might associate fatwas with death threats, after the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a threat against Salman Rushdie for his novel The Satanic Verses, a fatwa is simply a call to action – in this case, to save animals from extinction.

Java rhinoceros' are critically endangered and are already extinct in other countries including China and India after being hunted in the 19th and 20th centuries.

The Sumatran tiger is another animal threatened with extinction in the country. 93 per cent of all tigers have disappeared over the past 100 years.

Lar Gibbons face a bleak future as a result of deforestation and people's taste for their meat. They are also captured to be kept as pets.

There are big efforts to protect remaining orangutans but in the past they have been kept as pets and traded when they were young, which often involved the killing of their mothers. Habitat loss for pall oil plantations has also led to their decline in numbers.

Hayu Susilo Prabowo, a member of the Indonesian Council of Clerics, said the edict was developed in consultation with environmental activists and academics affiliated with the National University in Jakarta.

While council edicts have no legal weight, the announcement shows the impact of conservation efforts in the country.

The fatwa is aimed at encouraging people to protect the environment, including endangered animals such as rhinos and elephants that also live in the country, said Mr Prabowo, head of the council's environment and natural resources committee.

The Indonesian Council of Clerics is not the first religious body to get involved in the protection of animals.

In 2005 the Dalai Lama called upon his followers to end trafficking.

South Africa's Nazareth Baptist (Shembe) Church, a traditional Zulu church, has recently begun to use fake leopard skins in its ceremonies to protect the real creatures living nearby.

The trip to Sumatra for Muslim leaders in September last year, organised by Indonesia's Universitas Nasional (UNAS), WWF-Indonesia and the U.K.-based Alliance of Religions and Conservation, is thought to have inspired the fatwa.

It is thought to be the first of its kind in the world.

Leaders talked with villagers about how they live side-by-side with elephants and tigers, after some locals asked about the status in Islam of the endangered animals.

‘They are creations of Allah, as we are. It is haram to kill them, and keeping them alive is part of the worship of God,’ the leaders reportedly said.

‘We want to make people aware that 
damaging the environment is immoral and killing endangered species 
violates Islamic teachings. Animals have to be protected, either at zoos
 or in the wild,’ he said.

The edict means that the moving or killing of endangered animals is 'haram' or forbidden and there is a chance that the message could resonate strongly with people living in Indonesia, which has the world’s largest Muslim population.

'People can escape government regulation, but they cannot escape the word of God,' Mr Prabowo told National Geographic.

The fatwa also urges the government to review the licenses of palm oil plantations, which damage natural habitats and make life even harder for many endangered species.

WWF Indonesia and other conservation groups worked with forestry ministry officials and the council on the edict, which will be officially announced on March 12 at Jakarta's Ragunan Zoo.

The move comes at a time when trading of endangered animals across borders has reached record levels.

Governments
 are struggling to come up with effective laws to quash poaching and 
criminal trafficking networks, which are growing increasingly 
sophisticated.
