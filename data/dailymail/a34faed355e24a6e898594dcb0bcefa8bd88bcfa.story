The majority of Americans do not think President Barack Obama has been aggressive enough with the Islamic State, a poll released on Wednesday revealed.

A resounding 74 percent described Obama's actions toward Islamic extremists as 'not tough enough.' And another 52 percent said they'd be in favor of allowing the president to use U.S. ground troops to take out ISIS if airstrikes in Iraq and Syria are not enough.

Likely voters went a step further and told pollsters for Fox News that they're skeptical the president's plans to degrade and destroy the terrorist group will work at all without boots on the ground.

Obama has categorically rejected the notion that he could ask American forces  to engage in combat in Iraq, but 58 percent of likely voters said they don't see a path to success if he doesn't.

If President Obama changed course in Iraq and sent in U.S. ground troops, the majority of Americans would support him. In fact, most likely voters think he's going to have to if he wants to defeat ISIS

That's more than double the percentage of likely voters who said bombs alone would send ISIS packing, 23 percent, and three times the percentage who couldn't say one way or the other, 19 percent.

Overall all respondents to Fox's survey, which was commissioned by Democratic polling firm Anderson Robbins Research and Republican firm Shaw & Company Research and conducted Sunday through Tuesday, were unhappy with nearly every single angle of President Obama's strategy to combat the terrorist group.

Worse, nearly two-thirds of respondents - 64 percent - said they don't even think Obama has a 'clear strategy' for taking out the Islamic State, even though the President has repeatedly clarified that he does after inadvertently stating last summer that he didn't. 

Obama has since shared his plans with the American people.In a prime-time address last month, the president said his long-term strategy will rely on airstrikes against militants in Iraq and Syria, military aid to Iraqi and Kurdish forces, a training and weapons program to arm moderate Syrian rebels and a broad international coalition working together on a number of fronts.

Yet 53 percent of respondents still say Obama's doing a bad job handling terrorist threats. The same percentage gave him poor marks on Iraq.

Likewise, 54 percent of people polled said it was 'crazy' for the president to announce to the enemy that he wouldn't authorize U.S. ground forces under any circumstances. Just 34 percent said it was 'smart' to clue Americans in on planned military engagement.

An alarming 80 percent of Americans said they are either very or somewhat concerned that ISIS is going to attack the United States i n the 'near future,' despite assurances from the Department of Homeland Security and other Obama administration officials that they've found no evidence to support that assessment.

The only terrorist plot uncovered by the U.S. in recent months that it's shared with the public is one being plotted in Syria by the unrelated Khorason Group. 

Like ISIS it is an an off-shoot of al Qaeda but the two do not appear to be working together. The Pentagon announced late last month that it had preemptively struck the group in Syria as a preventative measure.
