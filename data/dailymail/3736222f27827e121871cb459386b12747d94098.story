Napoli players made the most of the awful conditions at their training session on Thursday by sliding through a huge puddle.

The Serie A side played 6 vs 6 in the pouring Naples rain ahead of their home clash against Empoli, but at the end of the session the six winners linked hands to do a Jurgen Klinsmann-esque dive.

Napoli posted the image on their Instagram, saying:  'Dip in the water for 6 winners!'

The club posted on their Instagram: 'Tuffo nell'acqua per i 6 vincitori!' translated as 'Dip in the water for 6 winners!'

Napoli boss Rafael Benitez kept himself dry from the puddle at least, as the former Liverpool boss prepares his side for an onslaught on the top two in Italy; Roma and Juventus.

Napoli currently sit in third place, eight points behind Roma and 11 behind Juventus. They have drawn their last two games in the league but are unbeaten in eight games in all competitions.
