 Ever had a cheeky dream about
Boris Johnson? Wished you could have a romantic date with Alan Carr or Ricky Gervais? Then you’re
not alone. 

A recent survey asked women around the country to reveal their
secret ‘funny man’ crushes and This Morning’s hit presenter, Phillip Schofield,
came out on top with nearly a quarter (22 per cent) of the vote.

Fo Scho: Almost a quarter of women have a 'secret' crush on Philip Schofield (left), with David Walliams (right) coming in a close second

The survey was commissioned as research revealed that men who can make us
laugh are actually more attractive to women in the UK.

The results show that silver-haired fox Schofe has a firm grasp on our hearts but it seems other dads are topping the list with new
father and comedian David Walliams coming in second with 20 per cent of
the vote, followed by London Mayor Boris Johnson with 12 percent. Jack Black, Johnny Vegas and Bill Bailey also made
the cut.

 With 12 per cent of the vote, Boris Johnson (left) doesn't exactly have an olympic-size following, but he got three times more votes than Ricky Gervais (right)

Total hotties? Comedians Bill Bailey (left) and Jack Black (right) got 9 and 7 per cent of the vote, respectively

Cadbury Crispello launched the
survey as part of an on-going campaign to encourage Brits
to submit their cheeky stories in a competition fronted by comedian
Vikki Stone.

Brits have been revealing their moments to the Cadbury UK Facebook
page to be in with a chance of having their tale re-created by Vikki, either on
film or as part of a series of stand-up gigs. 

Five stories are picked each week
to go to the public vote. The three most popular stories will have their
moment made famous by Vikki with a personalised gig live in their hometown.

Vikki Stone said, 'Who doesn’t
have a thing for Phillip Schofield? I even dedicated an entire song to him!
It’s great to see so many comedians in the list and definitely shows that
cheeky comedy goes a long way to bagging yourself a partner!'
