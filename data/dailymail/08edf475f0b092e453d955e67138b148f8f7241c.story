Britain could agree to accept hundreds of refugees from camps in and around Syria, following pressure from the Liberal Democrats.

David Cameron is facing calls from Nick Clegg to drop his opposition to the idea of giving sanctuary to some of the 2.3 million people displaced in the bloody conflict.

The Lib Dems want Britain to sign up to the United Nations appeal for Western countries to accept 30,000 of those trapped in the region.

Help: Britain has so far refused to sign up to the United Nations refugee programme to provide sanctuary to 30,000 people trapped in Syria although Cameron said he was ready to take in some of the most vulnerable

In a sign that Mr Cameron’s position was shifting, he told the Commons yesterday that he was ready to take in some of the most vulnerable refugees from camps in and around Syria.

But he stopped short of agreeing to take part in the UN scheme. France has agreed to take 500 refugees and Germany has accepted 1,000 with a promise of admitting another 9,000.

The move comes as fears grow that peace talks are close to collapse after a furious clash over President Assad’s future.

Amid hostile exchanges in Switzerland, Syria’s government ridiculed demands by opposition leaders and their Western backers including Britain for Assad to stand down, saying it would never happen.

With renewed fighting in large parts of Syria, the opposition insisted the country’s leader lost his legitimacy when he crushed a once-peaceful protest movement.

But foreign minister Walid al-Moallem said it was terrorists and foreign meddling that had ripped his country apart.

Now Mr Clegg and his senior Cabinet colleagues are pushing for Britain to do more to help the millions of people caught up in the conflict.

It comes after Ukip leader Nigel Farage called for Britain to start admitting Syrian refugees, arguing ‘there is a responsibility on all of us in the free west’, although he later rowed back after am outcry from Ukip members.

A Lib Dem minister told MailOnline: ‘Nigel Farage was absolutely right. Britain should be doing the right thing and providing help to these people who are just desperate.’

Mr Cameron insists Britain is leading the world in delivering aid and was meeting its obligations to asylum seekers, but he has rebuffed calls from Mr Clegg to sign up the United Nations refugee quota scheme.

Opinions: David Cameron has set himself against signing up to the UN scheme but Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is urging him to do more to help people in the region

A Lib Dem source told The Times: ‘We 
are one of the most open-hearted countries in the world and Nick 
believes we have a moral responsibility to help.

‘The
 coalition Government has been the most generous in the world when it 
comes to helping with the humanitarian crisis in Syria and it would be 
self-defeating to allow ourselves to be painted as the least generous.

‘The
 Liberal Democrats will continue to make the case around the Cabinet 
table. We have yet to gain the agreement of our Conservative colleagues,
 but we remain hopeful that we will.’

Mr
 Cameron warned that countries which had signed up to the UNHCR scheme -
 such as Finland, France and Sweden - should not feel that by taking a 
few hundred people they had fulfilled their obligations.

A
 senior Downing Street source suggested that the kind of ‘hardship 
cases’ where the UK could consider taking in refugees might include 
children who had been orphaned by the war or who had medical needs or 
mental health problems which could not be dealt with in the camps.

Britain
 is the second largest bilateral donor of aid to help those affected by 
the crisis and has taken in more than 1,000 Syrian asylum seekers.

Labour leader Ed Miliband is to force a vote in the House of Commons next week on allowing Syrian refugees into Britain

Mr Cameron's official spokesman today declined to give any timetable or estimate of numbers of Syrian refugees facing extreme hardship who might be admitted.

The spokesman said: 'What the Government is doing is looking at how we can help the most vulnerable cases of extreme hardship.'

But Labour insists that this was not enough to respond to the scale of MPs' concerns, and announced it would stage an opposition day vote next Wednesday calling for Britain to sign up to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees appeal for Western countries to accept 30,000 of those trapped in the region.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: 'Britain cannot be seen to turn its back on the most vulnerable Syrian refugees who will struggle to survive or cope in the camps, and must support the UN urgently.

'The Government response on the UN programme for vulnerable Syrian refugees is completely inadequate - as Tory and Liberal backbenchers and even the Deputy Prime Minister have now accepted.'

Anna Musgrave from the Refugee Council said: 'The UNHCR has long been calling on the UK to offer safe haven to those who will struggle to survive in the region.

'For every person rescued from the region, a resettlement place would be life changing.'
