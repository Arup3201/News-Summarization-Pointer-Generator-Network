'Suicide': Gary Engel, pictured in a mug shot from the 1980s, was found hanged in his jail cell on Monday

A former police officer accused of plotting to torture, dismember and bleed a businessman to death as part of a plan to extort millions from him has died in jail in an apparent suicide.

Gary Engel, 61, was found hanged in his cell by a bedsheet on Monday morning, McHenry County Deputy Coroner Robert Locke told the Chicago Sun-Times.

He was due to be arraigned for his alleged crimes in federal court in Chicago, Illinois on Tuesday and was being held alone in a cell. Coroners are now waiting for his toxicology results before they rule the death as suicide.

It comes less than two weeks after Engel was arrested with a fellow former police officer, Steven Mandell, and accused of plotting to kill a man who owned real estate.

The duo intended to pose as police officers and, using a fake arrest document, kidnap the man and take him to a custom-built murder chamber to torture him, according to conversations secretly recorded by a witness co-operating with police.

They planned to take the man to an office with a giant sink to drain his blood and torture him until he gave them money and millions of dollars worth of real estate, according to the criminal complaint.

'My guy knows what he's doing, he knows 
how to waterboard, do interrogation, psy-ops,' Mandell, also 61, allegedly said of
Engel.

On recordings, Mandell allegedly guessed
the victim made as much as $100,000 a month in cash from 25 rental 
properties. The men also discussed demanding at least $500,000 from the 
man.

They then allegedly intended to dismember him with saws and a butcher's knife and Engel allegedly said he 
wanted the victim's dead body to 'bleed out... you want to let him 
drain'.

But before they could carry out the grisly murder, they were caught by the FBI in an undercover operation and arrested at the makeshift torture chamber in the northwest side of Chicago.

Officers said the men both had fake firearms and bogus law enforcement credentials. Mandell also possessed a fake arrest document naming the victim as a criminal defendant.

The FBI also found saws, a butcher 
knife, numerous zip-ties for restraints and a loaded .22 caliber 
semi-automatic pistol at the site.

Both
men had previously been convicted - and cleared - of a similarly gruesome plot in Missouri in 1984; they allegedly intended to kidnap a Kansas 
City nightclub owner and extort money from him.

Partner in crime: He allegedly planned to pose as a police officer with fellow former cop Steven Mandell, pictured, to nab the victim. Both men were convicted - and later released - for a similar crime in the 80s

Engel was sentenced to 90 years in prison in 1991, while Mandell was sentenced to death in a separate murder case - making him the first police officer ever to go on death row.

Yet both men were eventually cleared and released after arguing that evidence had been improperly withheld at his trial. Engel was freed in 2010.

In this most recent case, both men were charged with attempted extortion and conspiracy to commit extortion.

Mandell was a Chicago police officer for 10 years until 1983 while Engel worked in Willow Springs.
