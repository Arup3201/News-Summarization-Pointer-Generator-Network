A severed deer's head was left at a Tesco supermarket checkout and entrails strewn across one of the aisles.

The body parts are believed to have been left by a man in the early hours of the morning last Tuesday.

Police are now investigating the incident, which is being treated as criminal damage as the check-out surfaces had to be professionally cleaned at a cost of £300.

A spokesman for Essex Police said: ‘Officers were called to a Tesco on Radwinter Road, Saffron Walden, just before 1.20am on Tuesday June 4.

'This was after reports that a deer head had been left at one of the self-scan checkouts and offal deposited in one of the aisles.

‘Officers are investigating the incident.’

Tesco refused to comment on the incident. A spokesman said: 'We apologise to our customers for this incident. It is a matter for the police and we are helping them with their enquiries.'

The severed deer's head was left at a Tesco self-service checkout, like the one pictured left. Right is a file picture of a red deer stag, although it's unclear exactly what type of decapitated deer was left at Tesco
