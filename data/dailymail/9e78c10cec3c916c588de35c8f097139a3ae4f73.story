It is the news that no one trying to sell their home ever wants to hear.

The estate agent sighs, fiddles with his tie, and finally suggests: ‘We may have to think about dropping the asking price a bit.’

Spare a thought then, for the owner of the spectacular 14-bedroom Heath Hall, which has been on the market since 2011.

Bargain? The asking price for Heath Hall in North London has been cut from £100million to £65million

Hall: The home was thoroughly restored by its current owner, property tycoon Andreas Panayiotou

Luxury: The home is believed to be the most expensive property currently on the market in Britain

He has just had to slash the asking price by a staggering £35million.

Now the stunning Edwardian mansion, which had a price tag in the region 
of £100million, and boasts a library, cinema, gym and wine cellar, is 
available for what the estate agent calls a ‘more realistic’ 
£65million. 

It’s still fantasy money to most of us. After all, the price-drop figure
 alone is of lottery-winning proportions, enough to buy a portfolio of 
more than 200 average-priced British properties.

But in the world of the mega-rich, Heath Hall is now apparently 
something of a bargain. So, what do you get for your money? Firstly, the
 benefit of £40million in renovations, completed by owner Andreas 
Panayiotou, the property magnate who bought Heath Hall in 2006.

Accessories: As well as an indoor swimming pool, Heath Hall boasts a sauna and a snooker room

Cinema: The pricey house is perfect for cinephiles, as it boasts its own private screening room

Grounds: The home is set in 2.5 acres of land and is near the wilderness of Hampstead Heath

Imported: The exquisite marble used in the bathrooms of Heath Hall came from Italy

It
 may be hard for most of us to imagine how a house could be worth 
£65million, but Heath Hall combines giant scale with the most opulent 
luxury.

The mansion has
 14 bedrooms, each with its own bathroom, while the master bedroom has a
 steel-lined panic room attached in case the super-rich owner is 
targeted by burglars or kidnappers.

Its
 six reception rooms are decorated in Italian marble and seven different
 types of wood, while the hall and library are lined with oak.

When
 it comes to relaxation, Heath Hall boasts a 'leisure complex' featuring
 a swimming pool, gymnasium, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi.

For the sporty-minded resident, the house has a snooker room and outdoor tennis courts.

And
 the more sedentary variety of billionaire would doubtless appreciate 
the private cinema and climate-controlled cellar with space for more 
than 600 bottles of vintage wine.

Although
 the home was built in 1910, it features some distinctively modern 
touches - instead of light switches rooms are equipped with 
touchscreens, and it is possible to control the building's electrical 
systems using an iPad.

The grounds of Heath Hall occupy 2.5 acres, which apparently makes the garden one of the largest in North London.

The makeover has left the house, on The Bishops Avenue in Hampstead, 
North London, as one of the capital’s finest homes.

As well as 14 
bedroom suites, and 12 bathrooms, the house has six reception rooms, a 
drawing room, dining room, family room, sun room and snooker room. 

The cellar can hold 600 bottles of wine and has its own climate-control 
temperature system and the gym comes with a steam room, sauna and 
swimming pool.

Twelve types of Italian marble and seven types of wood were used for the
 bathrooms while the snooker room, office, bar, library and grand 
staircase are all made of the finest oak.

The master-bedroom has a 
steel-walled dressing room that doubles as a panic room for the 
occupants to retreat to in an emergency. The house’s entire electrical 
system can be controlled by iPad.

If you ever tire of the interior, you could always step outside and 
wander through the 2.5acres of gardens. Heath Hall was originally built 
for sugar magnate William Park Lyle in 1910.

The Bank of China took over the property in the 1950s and housed its 
staff on bunk beds. When Mr Panayiotou bought it seven years ago, he 
decided the first thing the 19,000sq/ft property needed was a little 
extra room.

His £40million renovations added an extra 8,000 sq/ft and 
employed 120 tradesmen.

Heath Hall is currently the most expensive property for sale on the open
 market. It’s the least you could expect for a house in The Bishops 
Avenue, also known as Billionaires’ Row.

Grant Alexson, from Knight 
Frank, which is marketing the property, said: ‘The £65million price is 
more realistic. It is not a bargain, but there is no house like it. It 
is beyond ambassadorial, it is the sort of home which is perfect for 
kings or princes.’

Exclusive: The Bishops Avenue is known as 'Billionaires Row' because of its super-wealthy residents

Bedroom: This is just one of the 14 luxurious suites in the £65million house built in 1910

Relaxing? The restoration of the extraordinary house required 120 workmen

Heath Hall may be the most valuable home on the market, but Central London is full of houses worth £1million or more.

And while some of warned that London house prices have formed a bubble, they are still continuing to rise, with prices in the most exclusive areas up by six per cent in just one month.

The average home in Kensington & Chelsea now costs £2.32million, up 6.2 per cent on a month ago, with Westminster properties up 5.8 per cent to £1.58million.

The soaring prices have been blamed on the collapse in the value of the pound, which makes British real estate much more attractive to foreign buyers whose wealth is denominated in dollars, euros, rubles or yuan.

Across London as a whole, the average house price is £496,298 - up 1.9 per cent in a month and nine per cent more than a year ago.
