'Revenge of the Nerds' actor Robert Carradine has been cited with careless driving after crossing into oncoming traffic and slamming into a tractor-trailer.

Carradine, 60, and his wife, Edie Mani, were both injured in the afternoon crash on March 5 near Dolores, in the state's southwestern corner, but the injuries are not life-threatening.

According to the Colorado State Patrol, the actor's 2003 Mercury Marauder crossed into the oncoming lane on Colorado Highway 145 and collided with the tractor-trailer.

The couple, who had been wearing seatbelts, were removed from the car and taken to Southwest Memorial Hospital and then transferred to Mercy Regional Medical Center in Durango.

It's unclear how long they were there. But neither was listed as being at the hospital Thursday, Mercy Regional spokesman David Bruzzese said.  

The truck driver, 59-year-old Richard Clayton of Wisconsin, wasn't injured, Trooper Josh Lewis said. 

James Saunders of the state patrol told The Durango Herald that neither alcohol nor speeding was a factor in the crash. Images of the scene also show that it was not snowing or raining at the time.

'The fact that they were wearing seat belts is why they are with us today,' he said.

The area of the highway was shut for more than two hours following the crash. 

A publicist for Carradine has yet to respond to a request for comment on the actor's condition, but Carradine was back using his Twitter account earlier this week.

The youngest of a prolific acting family, Robert Carradine worked steadily in film and television for more than 40 years.

He and half-brother David Carradine often could be seen in the same projects, including the TV series 'Kung Fu,' Walter Hill's 'The Long Riders,' and Paul Bartel's 'Cannonball.'

Robert Carradine's biggest hit came in 1984 with the off-color comedy 'Revenge of the Nerds,' in which he played head nerd Lewis Skolnick.

He reprised the role in the big screen sequel and two small-screen follow-ups.

More recently, Quentin Tarantino cast Robert Carradine as a tracker in the 2012 film 'Django Unchained.'

Tarantino is filming his latest movie, 'The Hateful Eight,' in nearby Telluride, Colorado, but the Weinstein Co. said Carradine is not involved with that project.

He has three children; a daughter from a previous relationship and a daughter and a son with Mani.
