Brazil has admitted all six of its World Cup stadiums under construction will not be ready in time to meet FIFA’s December 31 deadline.

But the Brazilian government brushed aside the importance of more delays in completing 2014 World Cup stadiums, saying that missing the deadline will not affect the country's ability to successfully host next year's tournament.

Yesterday FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke said three stadiums would not be ready in time for the December 31 deadline, but today Brazilian officials said they actually plan to deliver all six remaining venues after that date.

They claim only three are delayed, 
with the other three being handed over after the expected date only 
because of problems accommodating the schedule of Brazilian President 
Dilma Rousseff, who wants to be present for the ceremonies.

Brazil's
 Sports Minister Aldo Rebelo said Brazil is like a bride who gets to the
 wedding late, but the event still goes on as expected.

'In
 every wedding that I attended the bride was late. I've never seen a 
bride arrive on time. But I've never seen a wedding not happen because 
of that,' Rebelo said.

'It's probable that there will be a delay here or there, but nothing too significant. What is important is that all of the stadiums will be ready (in the end).'

FIFA has already said it will have to change plans at the venues because of the delivery delays. FIFA Marketing Director Thierry Weil said the schedule for the release of tickets has already been slightly altered because the seating plans have not been finalized, and football's governing body said other areas will also be affected.

'Due to the reduced timeline, FIFA, the LOC, government and stadium authorities are adjusting the stadium operational program to ensure that the stadiums are delivered and host events prior to the FIFA World Cup without compromising on safety or quality,' FIFA said in a statement.

Brazilian officials reiterated there was no reason for concern.

'We are in a much more advanced stage at this point in time than we were before the Confederations Cup,' Brazil's deputy sports minister Luis Fernandes said. 'In March, there were still doubts whether the Maracana would be ready for the final. We are in a much better position now. The only doubt we have is related to the Sao Paulo stadium.'

But there is still confusion about the delivery date of the other five stadiums that aren't ready, with the government, local World Cup organizers and FIFA saying different things. The other six World Cup stadiums were ready for the Confederations Cup.

Valcke had said that in addition to Sao Paulo, the southern city of Curitiba and the wetlands city of Cuiaba also would not be ready to deliver their stadiums by the end of the year as expected.

He said they would likely be ready in January or February.

Rebelo, the government official in charge of Brazil's preparations for the World Cup and the 2016 Rio Olympics, said Wednesday that the stadium in Porto Alegre was also delayed, and that the remaining stadiums will only be delivered in January.

The local World Cup organizing committee had said that only Sao Paulo and Curitiba were facing delays, and that Curitiba might not be ready until March.

'They will all be delivered with enough time for the test events that are needed before the World Cup,' Rebelo said.

Last week two people were killed after a crane collapsed at the Brazilian football stadium due to host the opening match at next year's World Cup.

The final part of the structure, which was due to be one of the centerpieces of the 2014 tournament,  was being installed at the Corinthians stadium when the 500-ton crane cut through the roof of the east side stand, causing extensive damage.

One of the dead workers, 42-year-old Fabio Luis Pereira, was inside a truck when it was hit by the falling metal structure.

The other, 44-year-old Ronaldo Oliveira dos Santos, was said to be 'napping' during a break in an area that was supposed to have been cleared.

It was not the first time Brazil has suffered setbacks and experienced accidents at stadium construction sites.

One worker died during construction of a stadium in the capital Brasilia last year and another in the Manaus venue in March.

Also in March, heavy rains flooded the construction site of the Maracana Stadium, forcing the cancellation of a FIFA inspection visit at the time. In May, a small part of the roof at the Salvador stadium fell in after it wasn't able to sustain the large amount of water that settled on top of it.

In April, another worker died at the construction site of the new Palmeiras stadium, which may be used for teams training for the World Cup in Sao Paulo.

The construction site was stopped for 10 days after the incident, but the damage was not as significant as at the Corinthians venue.

In Rio, the stadium which will host athletics in the 2016 Olympics has been closed for several months because of fears that its roof could collapse. Renovation work is underway at the venue.
