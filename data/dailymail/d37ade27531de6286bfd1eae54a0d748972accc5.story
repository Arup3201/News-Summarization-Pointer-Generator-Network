NHS executives facing the axe are in line for bumper redundancy payoffs – and could walk back into Health Service jobs within a month, it has emerged.

Sir David Nicholson wrote to staff whose posts will go as part of the health reforms explaining that they can be rehired by the NHS after four weeks.

Many managers are set for six-figure payoffs when they are made redundant next month. Some are expected to receive more than £450,000.

However, Sir David has urged them to wait at least six months before returning to work to avoid ‘reputational damage’ to the NHS.

Yesterday it also emerged that 400 managers currently employed by the NHS earn more than the Prime Minister, who is on £142,500.

Tory MP Nigel Ellis, who obtained the figures, said: ‘I accept that a person in a position of responsibility will need to be properly remunerated.

‘But for 400 managers to be paid more than the Prime Minister who has responsibility for running the country is ludicrous.’ 

But the revelation that those being made redundant could walk straight into new jobs – at a time when the NHS is under unprecedented financial pressure – is sure to fuel anger among patients.

The letter is also further evidence that Sir David is presiding over a culture of secrecy within the NHS.

It states: ‘I would ask these individuals to be mindful of this and of the possible reputational damage to themselves and to the NHS should they seek to gain paid employment or consultancy work in the NHS soon after they receive their redundancy payments.’ 

Already Sir David is suspected of presiding over a regime whereby hospitals routinely fiddle their figures and whistleblowers – such as Gary Walker, who said he was sacked as chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust because of a row over an 18-week non-emergency waiting list target – are discouraged from speaking out.

Last night Tory MP Charlotte Leslie said: ‘The tone of this letter does very little to persuade anyone who has concerns that Sir David is encouraging a culture of cover-ups.

‘It confirms exactly what has been behind all the problems we have seen with the Mid Staffordshire scandal. The reaction is always to try and bury bad news.’

On April 1, thousands of managers and staff employed at Primary Care Trusts and Strategic Health Authorities will be made redundant when these bodies are axed as part of the NHS reforms.

Yet many will be re-employed by new, GP-led groups or recently-formed organisations such as the NHS Commissioning Board or Public Health England.

Even so, the NHS is expected to spend more than a £1billion on their redundancy packages, with thousands of staff in line for six-figure sums. This is despite the fact the Health Service is trying to save money, with hospitals rationing non-urgent treatments and slashing nursing posts.

Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘It speaks volumes of the culture embodied by Sir David Nicholson that senior staff at the NHS are handed such huge pay-offs even if they may return only months later.

‘The NHS is overly bureaucratic with too many pen-pushers handed jobs for life. Cutting this bloated bureaucracy is vital but unnecessarily generous pay-offs will undermine efforts to trim the fat.

‘Ministers have forced the NHS to spend millions on managers’ pay-offs at the same time as thousands of nursing jobs are being axed. It’s a shameful waste of resources.’ 

Under NHS rules, managers will be given one month’s redundancy pay for every year they have worked.

One, Sir Neil McKay, the chief executive of Midlands and East Strategic Health Authority, is reportedly set for a package worth £465,000.
