Party-loving: Prince Harry was spotted at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas enjoying a short break with friends

Prince Harry has returned to Sin City to enjoy a vacation sitting by the pool, sipping cocktails and enjoying the company of bikini-clad ladies.

The young Royal was accompanied by a small group of male friends this weekend at the MGM Grand hotel on the Vegas strip.

Dressed in flowery red swimming trunks, he went mostly unnoticed at the 'ultra pool' - where an elite crowd mingles around the water's edge listening to DJs.

Prince Harry has been staying in a private bungalow at the hotel and kept close to it during most of the day.

Attention was drawn from him by the presence of Jennifer Lopez who was hosting a party at the hotel.

A hotel guest told People: 'A few groups of women approached him 
throughout the day and he talked to them briefly, but he didn't really 
center his attention on anyone.

'He definitely loved the attention, but he looked to be a gentleman with all the women.'

It was a change of pace for the prince who took a leading role in the Royal Family and was selected as figurehead for the spectacular farewell to the Olympic Games in London last week. 

The high-profile task fell to the 27-year-old prince who sat alongside his sister-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge at the event.

The prince visited Las Vegas last year with his fellow pilots during a tough 12-week helicopter course in the U.S.

He checked into the Wynn Hotel last 
November and spent an evening at its Tryst nightclub where he appeared 
particularly taken with a blonde in a cream blouse and black leather 
skirt, chatting to her on a couch and dancing with her.

A reveller said: ‘Harry looked very 
close to one girl who looked to be in her early 20s. He was dancing with
her and they had their arms around each other.

'They were hugging and at one point 
he had his hands around her waist as they danced. They all left together
at about 3am, Harry still looking very close to the girl.’
