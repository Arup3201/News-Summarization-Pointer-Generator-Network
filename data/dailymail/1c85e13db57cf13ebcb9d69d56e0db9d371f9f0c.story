A father-of-17 ignored a fire extinguisher in the kitchen and failed to attempt to tackle the fire with water as a house fire that trapped his six children took hold, a court heard today.

Michael Philpott, 56, was accused of planting a wrench outside his house which he used to smash the upstairs bedroom window where the children were sleeping.

But he was 'consumed with guilt' when he was unable to reach the children as thick black smoke poured out of the window.

The court heard after dialling 999, instead of tackling the fire he handed the phone to his wife, Mairead, 31, and went straight outside in his boxer shorts, tracksuit bottoms and socks to a ladder, 'fortunately' left in the back yard.

Accused: On his third day in the dock Philpott was accused by the prosecution of having a 'plan' to be a 'hero' but it turned into a 'nightmare'

In the dock: Philpott told the court today 'I did not light the fire. I did not endanger my children'

In a series of combative exchanges during a second day of cross-examination, prosecutor Richard Latham QC outlined for the first time how the prosecution allege the defendant planned the blaze and ill-fated rescue attempt.

During a second day of cross-examination, Mr Latham told the defendant: 'It was a plan, wasn't it? 'Your plan was to rescue your children and be a hero.

'The ladder was there because that was part of the plan, wasn't it? 'The plan was light the fire, make the 999 call, rescue them out of the back window....You were going to open the window and get the children out and be a hero and a victim at the same time.'

During a series of repeated denials about there being a plan, Philpott at one point addressed the 'ladies and gentlemen of the jury' directly, telling them: 'I did not light the fire. I did not endanger my children.'

When the prosecutor accused him of pretending to fate as six of his children lay dead, he responded with the question: 'Do you know what it is like to smell your children decomposing?'

At which point a court onlooker in his 20s shouted out: 'Shut up, you d**khead - f***ing d**khead', to which Philpott responded 'You shut up'.

The court was also played part of the 999 call made by Philpott and his wife Mairead, 31 - who is also charged with six counts of manslaughter.

The couple told police Mrs Philpott had searched their conservatory for something to give to her husband to smash the window while he was up the ladder.

But the court heard there was no evidence on the call of Mrs Philpott either searching for the implement, which has previously been described in court as a metal electrical socket, or passing it to her husband.

Asked by Mr Latham why Philpott could be heard to say 'God, please help me', during the call, the defendant claimed he was simply distressed at the thought of losing his children.

But the prosecutor suggested it to Philpott it was because he was responsible for the 'nightmare...that was unfolding in front of you'.

The trial at Nottingham Crown Court has also heard how Philpott, by then aware petrol was the accelerant used to start the blaze, had warned police they may find petrol on his clothing or inside the house when they were seized for examination, because he had carried a petrol-powered strimmer from his back garden through the property a few days before the blaze last May.

But Mr Latham told him: 'The one thing you did not appreciate is that not only could scientists detect petrol (on clothing or surfaces), but the type of petrol as well. You didn't know that, did you?' Philpott said he was aware of the fact, through watching television programmes such as NCIS, the American crime show about a naval intelligence unit.

The court heard tests on the strimmer 
showed Texaco fuel had been used to power it, while Shell petrol was 
discovered at the seat of the fire. Total fuel deposits, meanwhile were 
found in the U-bend of the kitchen sink.

Tragic: Six children, aged between five and 13, died in the blaze at the house in Allenton, Derby, last May

Philpott could not explain how the fuel had got into the kitchen pipe, but admitted water and washing up liquid was routinely washed down the sink.

Mr Latham said that meant the fuel 'can't have been there very long' and suggested Philpott had washed petrol from his hands in the sink that night - a claim denied by Philpott.

He told Philpott: 'You used petrol to start this fire didn't you? You put it there.

Philpott replied: 'You can try and blame me as much as you like for this fire Mr Latham, but you have got the wrong two people.' Philpott's best friend, fork-lift truck driver Paul Mosley, 46, also denies the manslaughter of their children, Duwayne, 13, Jade, 10, John, nine, Jack, seven, Jesse, six, and five-year-old Jayden.

The prosecution have alleged Philpott set the fire to frame his former mistress Lisa Willis after she walked out of the family home in February taking her five children with her, four of which he fathered.

The court has heard Philpott was set to face Miss Willis in court on the day of the fatal blaze in May over residency of the five children.

Previously in his evidence, Philpott has claimed that he and his wife had received silent calls from a withheld number in the weeks leading up to the fire.

But today Mr Latham accused him of 'cooking up' the calls as part of the plan.

The prosecutor claimed Philpott was 'upping his plan' in the weeks before the fire and telling parents at the school gates he was confident he would get the children back from Miss Willis.

Mr Latham said: 'You told them you had a plan up your sleeve didn't you? She wasn't going to get away with it - that's Lisa isn't it?'

Philpott has also told the court that he received death threats from Miss Willis's family in the lead up to the fire.

Today Mr Latham claimed Philpott hoped to link the fire to the threats.

'The whole purpose of this fire was to link it to the threat,' he said.

Philpott denied the claims and said he would not endanger the lives of his six children.

Jade Philpott, 10, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, and Jayden, five, all died in the fire at their home.

Their brother Duwayne, 13, died two days later at Birmingham Children's Hospital.

The trial was adjourned for the day and will resume on Monday.
