Pampered poultry, step this way - to the new hen hotel. 

Sam Jones, 18, is charging £1 a night to look after pet chickens while their owners are on holiday.  

He is currently laying the foundations for his 'Chickens on Holiday' venture at Greenlands Farm Village, in Carnforth, Lancashire, where he works as an operations supervisor.

The enterprising teenager offers the pampered poultry everything they could want for their all-inclusive break, including family hutch accommodation, an abundance of fresh food, water and straw and even leftover cakes and scones.

He has only just started small-scale advertising but has been shocked by the number of people getting in touch, desperate to pack their chickens off, so they can enjoy a week in the sun.

He said: 'There are more and more people keeping chickens as pets.

'When they go on holiday, maybe they can't rely on family members or neighbours.

'There
 is a market for somebody to board chickens and, after just putting a 
few posters on lamp posts and Facebook, I can't believe how much 
interest there has already been.'

An estimated 500,000 households now keep chickens in Britain, sparked by celebrity poultry devotees such as chef Jamie Oliver model Liz Hurley and presenter Amanda Holden, as well as a trend for organic produce.

Mr Jones, who charges £1 per chicken per night with discounts for long stays, is now competing with a growing number of animal boarding businesses across the country, which are cashing in on the craze.

But he intends to stay ahead of the game with plans to host larger flocks and even branching out into families' waterborne pets.

He added: 'I am also looking at trying to do holidays for waterfowl, ducks and geese.

'I have been surprised that I've been getting quite a few people saying they have around 35 birds. I was expecting four to six.

'I think if people have kids, it is a way of learning how and where food comes from.

'There are a lot more families who are starting to get a few chickens in the back garden.

'If you are out at work all day, it's not like a dog where you are having to let them out every hour.'

Chicken owner Sam Cook, 33, of Mearnskirk, East Renfrewshire, keeps a small peep of chickens in her garden near a golf course.

The IT worker said: 'I think it's a great idea.

'When I go away, I have people I can call on to feed the chickens, but it's a bind for them to have to get up early.

'Knowing there are places you can safely drop them off when you go away on holiday is a bit of a godsend to be honest.'
