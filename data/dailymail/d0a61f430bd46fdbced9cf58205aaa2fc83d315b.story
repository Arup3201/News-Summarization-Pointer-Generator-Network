Oscar-nominated Hollywood director David O. Russell is being investigated by police over claims he inappropriately touched the breasts of his 19-year-old transsexual nephew.

Russell, the director behind The Fighter, is accused of grabbing the breasts of preoperative Nicholas Peloquin at a south Florida gym on December 30.

Peloquin, Russell's transsexual nephew and the son of the director's adoptive sister, told police the 53-year-old groped him during a workout session at the Embassy Suites hotel in Deerfield Beach last Friday.

Claim: Director David O. Russell, pictured at the Oscars last February, has been interviewed by police over the groping of 19-year-old transsexual Nicholas Peloquin, right.

It was reported that, according to 
Peloquin's testimony, the pair had been doing abdominal exercises and 
began talking about the 19-year-old's breasts when Russell's hand 
hovered above Peloquin's 'private parts'.

Peloquin,
a non-blood relative of Russell who has yet to undergo male-to-female 
gender reassignment surgery, had described 'the hormones to increase his
breasts' to Russell.

It was then the director put his hands under Peloquin's shirt 'and felt both breasts,' according to a police report.

Peloquin is said to have told police he felt 'uncomfortable' about the exchange, but at the same time did not tell Russell to stop.

The alleged groping took place at the Embassy Suites hotel in Deerfield Beach, Florida on December 30

Russell confirmed the exchange to police during an interview with officers, and said that Peloquin was acting 'very provocative toward him' during their workout before inviting him to feel his breasts.

The director is said to have told police that he was 'curious about the breast enhancement'.

Police told TMZ the case is still under investigation, and that they plan to re-interview both parties.

Russell's spokesperson, Cynthia Swartz, told TheWrap.com in a statement, 'David O. Russell emphatically denies any wrongdoing and has cooperated fully with the authorities.'

The case will eventually be submitted to the Florida State's Attorney's Office, which will decide if criminal battery charges will be filed.

Russell's agent, lawyer and publicist have yet to comment on the alleged incident.
