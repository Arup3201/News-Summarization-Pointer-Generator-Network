A man was today being quizzed on suspicion of murder after his wife was found dead at the home they shared.

Detectives made the grim discovery of the woman's body after her husband was believed to have dialled 999 to report an incident.

Officer's arrested the 60-year-old at the scene on suspicion of murder and he was taken to the police cells where he was awaiting questioning by senior detectives.

The drama unfolded after officers called to reports of a 'domestic incident' discovered the body of the 62-year-old at the home in Carnarvon Place in Newbury, Berkshire.

A spokesman for South Central Ambulance Service said: 'We were called at 7.30am this morning to an incident at an address in Carnarvon Place in Newbury.

'We sent one ambulance and an ambulance officer, but sadly a female casualty was deceased at the scene.'

A post mortem examination was expected to take place in due course to determine how the woman died.

Neighbours told how in January she was in hospital and when she returned home she was visited daily by a nurse.

'In March this year they enjoyed a holiday together in Belgium and then in April she threw him a surprise birthday party at a golf club,' said one woman, who asked not to be named.

'I don't think they had been married that long, maybe only a couple of years.'

Today uniformed officers stood guard outside the sheltered housing flat, which had been cordoned off.

Detective Chief Inspector Gill Wootton, who is leading the investigation, said: 'At this stage we are treating this as a murder inquiry and as such there will be a significant amount of work being undertaken at the property today.

'I would urge any of the local residents who may have seen or heard anything, either last night or this morning, to come forward and speak to our officers.

'There will be officers going door-to-door in the area to speak to local residents and offering them reassurance, and I would urge anyone with any concerns to speak with these officers.

'A post mortem examination will now take place to establish the cause of death.'
