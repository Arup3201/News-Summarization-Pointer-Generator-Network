Former herding dog Abayed nearly died when he was shot two years ago, but he is back up on his paws again now that he has a custom-made wheeled harness to get him about.

A stranger mistook six-year-old Abayed as a stray dog when he was running outside and tried to kill him as part of a programme to cut down on stray dogs in Jordan.

His distraught owners, who were shepherds, found him howling in pain and unable to move.

On his new wheels: Abayed can still walk in the country with his special walking aid that supports his injured hind legs

Missing his old job: The six-year-old former herding dog looks longingly at the sheep he would usually be chasing

His user-friendly home: Abayed now lives at an animal centre because his owners who were shepherds could not look after him after his injury

His owners rushed him to the Humane Center for Animal Welfare near the capital Amman to see if anything could be done for him.

The shelter did think about putting 
Abayed down, but the director of the centre said 'It was clear that this 
animal wanted to live' so they set about finding him a way to walk again.

Eventually they managed to import a special wheeled harness for him, giving him a new lease of life.

The shepherds could not look after him 
after he lost the use of his legs, so they gave him over to the animal 
centre, where he can get up the ramps with no trouble.

Taking a little break from walking: Abayed was nearly put down but the centre said they could tell that he really wanted to live when he was brought in

In his herding days, Abayed used to 
look after over a hundred sheep.

He still cannot resist following sheep and goats about when he sees them out on walks in the Jordanian countryside around the animal shelter.

Although his working life is over, Abayed can now live out his days as a pet as Jordan's first wheel-cart assisted dog.

Happy ending for Abayed: Margaret Ledger, head of the Humane Center for Animal Welfare, giving him water

Taking the weight off his hind legs: Abayed can now live out his life as a pet though he will never herd sheep like he used to
