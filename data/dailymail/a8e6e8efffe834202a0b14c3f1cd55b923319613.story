Break in the case: Steven Zelich, 52, was arrested Wednesday in connection to two female corpses found stuffed in suitcases found in Wisconsin earlier this month

A 52-year-old security officer from Milwaukee has been arrested in connection a pair of suitcases found stuffed with the decomposing remains of two women earlier this month.

Detectives wearing hazmat suits removed bags of evidence and a refrigerator from the suburban Milwaukee apartment of Steven Zelich, who was taken into custody Wednesday but not charged in the deaths.

The Town of Geneva Police Chief Steven Hurley said in a news release that Zelich, a former police officer, is accused of hiding the corpses of two women, one of whom has been identified as Laura Simonson, 37, of Farmington, Minnesota.

Simonson's body was discovered June 5 in a suitcase discarded along a rural road in Town of Geneva.

Authorities have not identified the remains of the second female but say she was a white female with long dark hair, a pronounced overbite and a small heart tattoo on her lower left abdomen.

Investigators searched the suspect's West Allis apartment Wednesday and carried out objects in large, brown paper bags. They also removed a refrigerator.

Chief Hurley issued a statement to assure 'the citizens of West Allis that there is no danger.'

The suspect is a licensed private 
security officer who has worked for Securitas Security Services USA 
2007, according to the Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional 
Services. He also worked on the side as a contractor for a website that offers users legal advice starting at $20 a month. 

Mr Zelich was forced to resign from the police force in West Allis in 2001 after allegedly getting
 into an off-duty fight with a prostitute whom he had accused of stealing from 
him.

Victims: Laura Simonson, 37, from Farmington, Minnesota, was one of two women whose bodies were discovered June 5 in two suitcases discarded along a rural road in Town of Geneva

Mr  Zelich, a security officer and former cop, has been charged with two counts of hiding corpses

Laura Simonson's father, Richard Wierson, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that his daughter had placed escort ads on Craigslist.

Wierson said she had struggled with mental illness since adolescence, and that her seven children were placed in foster care with him in 2010. One of her daughters, Alyssa, passed away last year.

A missing persons investigation initiated by the Farmington Police Department determined Simonson was last seen November 2 in Rochester.

Missing person: Simonson, a Craigslist escort, went missing in November 2013; a short time later, someone took out an ad online claiming that she had been enslaved and tortured by Steven Zelich

The 37-year-old was reported missing by her mother November 22, 2013 - about three weeks after she parked her van outside her family's home in Farmington.

On Thursday, police in Rochester announced  they have evidence suggesting that Simonson was killed at the Microtel Inn and Suites in town where the victim and Zelich allegedly stayed together on the night of November 2.

The next day, Zelich checked out of the motel but Simonson was no longer with him, police said. 

Following Ms Simonson's disappearance,
 an ad was placed on the site SecondCityClassifieds.com claiming that 
the divorced mother of seven was mentally disabled and had been enslaved
 and tortured by Steven Zelich.

The ad titled 'Steven Zelich is a predator' described the former law enforcement officer as a 'sadist' who had enslaved Simonson, keeping her 'naked, handcuffed, shackled, and caged.'

'He has no intention of ever releasing this poor woman who suffers from various mental disabilities. She has been whipped and tortured by Steven Mark Zelich since November 2, 2013,' the ad read.

The writer provided Zelich's cell phone number and email address, urging online users to harass the man and flood his inbox with messages.

The ad also revealed Zelich as an avid practitioner of sadomasochism who had been active on the site Collarme.com under the user name 'mrhandcuffs.'

That profile has since been deleted, but on the website Collarspace.com dedicated to the S&M lifestyle, a user by the nickname 'Mrhandcuffs' described himself as dominant and touted the virtues of having a long-term slave.

The profile was accompanied by a photo of a middle-aged man strongly resembling Zelich seated on a white couch.

'There is nothing better than a slave, tied tight, gagged, blindfolded, hooded, chained, caged...' he wrote.

'The slave I seek understands the incredible connection between owner and owned.'

According to Chicago Tribune,
 the 52-year-old licensed security officer also had been active on an online 
discussion board titled MasterB Slave Club, where he posted a similar message 
about 'seeking perm enslavement... ideally in a farm/caged situation.'

The second victim in the suitcase case was likely killed in Wisconsin, according to investigators.

Authorities have released an eerie sketch of what the mystery woman may have looked like. The computer-generated image depicts a woman with dark hair parted on the side, small eyes, a narrow nose and prominent teeth.

Police said the victim appears to be between the ages of 15 and 35, was 5 feet 2 inches to 5 feet 4 inches tall, weighed 120 to 140lbs, and had long straight black or dark brown hair. She had a quarter-sized heart tattoo on her lower left abdomen and two piercings in each ear.

A highway worker first came across the suitcases containing the female corpses June 5 as he mowed the grass in Geneva, about 50 miles southwest of Milwaukee.

At around 3pm that day, another person saw the dumped bags by the road and called the police department.

Those suitcases contained decomposing human remains. Passersby say they saw flies when they got out to investigate the suitcases.
