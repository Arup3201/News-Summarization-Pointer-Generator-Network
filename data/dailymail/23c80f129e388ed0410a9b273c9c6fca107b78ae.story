A man who attacked a cashpoint machine with a meat cleaver before smashing it to pieces told police he was only trying to get his bank card back.

Heartbroken Zhu Xiao was drowning his sorrows after being dumped by his girlfriend when the machine swallowed his card as he tried to withdraw money.

In a rage at not being able to continue drinking, he then dismantled the machine in a desperate attempt to reclaim his card.

Frustrated: Heartbroken Zhu Xiao was drowning his sorrows after being dumped by his girlfriend when the machine swallowed his card as he tried to withdraw money

Attack: In a desperate bid to get his card back, he attacked the machine with a screwdriver, pliers and a meat cleaver as he tried to take it apart

Dismantled: Almost one hour after starting his bizarre attack, Zhu removed the top of the machine thanks to his professional expertise as an electrician

The astonishing video shows Zhu, 38, approach the machine at 1.42am and place paper over what he believes to be the machine's built-in security camera.

But in his drunken stupor, he does not realise that another camera - located just above the machine - is recording his every move in the city of Wenling in Eastern China's Zhejiang Province.

He first takes a screwdriver out of his pocket and tries to dismantle the machine, before producing a meat cleaver from the inside of his jacket and tries to pry the machine open.  

After removing the top of the machine, he then uses a pair of pliers to crack it open even further - before then using the meat cleaver to violently hack at the ATM.

Almost one hour after he started, he is then seen using his bare hands and knowledge of electrical wiring to rip away the casing until he could get at his card.

He was spotted by a passer-by who called the police - but by the time they arrived, he had already fled the scene.

A police spokesman said: 'We managed to track him down using CCTV footage and the next day confronted him at a cyber cafe.

'He said he hadn't being trying to rob the machine but that he had wanted to retrieve his card.

'When we told him he could have gone to the bank the following day and they would have opened the machine for him, he said he wasn't aware of that.

'We checked out the story and it turned out to be true. He was very apologetic but was arrested for causing damage to property.' 

According to reports, Zhu now faces a  faces a repair fee of approximately £6,000, as well as further legal punishment for his late-night antics.
