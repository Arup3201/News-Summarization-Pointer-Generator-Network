Beyonce is set to take the coveted leading role in the latest version of A Star Is Born

It's the leading role that has crowned the career of some of Hollywood's finest actresses.

And now Beyoncé is set to follow in the footsteps of Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand by taking the coveted part in the latest version of A Star Is Born.

The film would provide Beyoncé, 33, with her biggest role yet, playing an unknown who rises to stardom as her famous husband's career spirals downwards. The movie will be directed by American Sniper actor Bradley Cooper, who is also expected to play the leading man.

The female lead was first created by Janet Gaynor in the original 1937 version, appearing with Fredric March. The movie was remade in 1954 with James Mason and Garland – who, like Gaynor, was rewarded with a Best Actress Oscar nomination – and again in 1976 with Streisand and Kris Kristofferson.

'Beyoncé feels this could be her big Hollywood breakthrough,' says a movie insider.

'It's a role she has wanted for years. She's shown that she can act in Austin Powers: Goldmember, and held her own singing in Dreamgirls, but this is her chance to prove her dramatic range and maybe even win an Academy Award.'

Hollywood studio Warner Bros has been trying to remake the film for years, negotiating with potential leading men including Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Cruise, Will Smith and Christian Bale.

But now Cooper, 40, fresh from his Oscar-nominated success in American Sniper, has come to the fore. He will first be appearing in the West End in May with his hit Broadway production of The Elephant Man. When that run ends, he will make his directorial debut with A Star Is Born, and he has named Beyoncé as his first choice for his leading lady. Negotiations are under way to finalise the deal.

Beyoncé was previously signed to star in a remake of the movie in 2011 when Clint Eastwood planned to direct the action, but the project fell apart a year later when the singer became pregnant with her daughter Blue Ivy. 'I was looking forward to the production and the opportunity to work with Clint Eastwood,' she said after dropping out.

'For months we tried to co-ordinate our schedules to bring this remake to life, but it was just not possible.' A source close to the singer added: 'Beyoncé wants this role, and she's going to do everything she can to make it happen, but right now it's down to her agents and managers to hammer out a deal that works for her and the studio.'

The singer's spokesman said: 'Beyoncé is looking to get back into films and thinks she can not only take on this role but bring something special to the part.'

It has been six years since she appeared on the big screen. However, that film, Obsessed, was a disappointment at the box office.
