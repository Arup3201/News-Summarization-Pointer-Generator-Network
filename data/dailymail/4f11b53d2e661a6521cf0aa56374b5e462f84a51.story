Captured on CCTV, this is the moment that turf war erupted in a quiet suburban street – as a couple had their front garden stolen by two middle-aged lawn thieves.

The women were filmed methodically rolling up the newly-laid turf, before scurrying off down the road.

The shameless pair had to make seven return trips to strip the garden bare – and even stopped half-way through for a cigarette break.

The 
victims’ neighbour Bobby Stacey caught the whole thing on CCTV, having 
installed a camera after thieves stole tools and a mountain bike from 
his own property.

Mr
 Stacey, 51, who owns a beauty salon, said his neighbour had spent all 
day carefully levelling his front garden before neatly laying the strips
 of turf.

‘He’d done a fantastic job. I went in to work and I had a 
phone call asking to check my CCTV because the turf had been stolen. I 
couldn’t believe it.’

Mr
 Stacey, of Skelmersdale, Lancashire, said he was stunned by the 
footage. ‘It was shamefully funny. I couldn’t stop laughing,’ he 
admitted.

‘It
 was about 5am in the morning ... it was dark when they started, but 
when they finished it had got light. It took about 40 minutes to an hour
 – half-way through they stopped and had a smoke and a sit down on my 
wall.’

Mr Stacey said he had heard rumours that the perpetrators were a mother-and-daughter team.

‘It
 was cheeky, but the turf must have cost at most £30 – it doesn’t even 
seem worth it,’ he said. ‘I couldn’t stop laughing. I was annoyed at the
 same time though. I don’t know where they took the turf, because that’s
 off-camera, but they must have been loading it up somewhere.

‘We
 live in a quiet neighbourhood and we have older people living behind 
these houses, and I worry for them if this goes any further.’

The
 owners of the stolen turf were too upset to talk about the raid 
yesterday. They fear they may fall victim to similar ‘pranks’ unless the
 pair are caught.

A
 spokesman for Lancashire Police confirmed that the incident had been 
reported, and that officers were investigating.

She said: ‘We’re at the 
stage that there are no further lines of inquiry, but would appeal to 
anyone with information to come forward.’
