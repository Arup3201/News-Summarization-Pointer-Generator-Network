While it enjoys a rise in earnings and customers, Irish budget airline Ryanair has been ordered to repay nearly £400,000 in illegal subsidies that it received from a German airport.

EU regulators ruled this week that marketing and airport service deals provided by Zweibrucken Airport to the Dublin-based carrier and other discount airlines were in breach of state aid rules.

The European Commission found that the deal between Ryanair and the airport near German's border with France was illegal because it provided Europe’s largest budget carrier with an unfair advantage over its competitors. 

Legal battle: Ryanair insists its agreements are not illegal and it will appeal the Zweibrucken Airport ruling

Ryanair stopped flying to and from Zweibrucken in 2009 after carrying 50,000 passengers.

While it was dealt a blow with the Zweibrucken Airport ruling, Ryanair scored a victory with the commission’s ruling that its agreements with Charleroi Airport in Belgium, Frankfurt Hahn in Germany, Alghero in Italy and Vasteras in Sweden did not violate state aid rules. 

The Charleroi ruling dates back to a complaint that was filed by competitor Brussels Airport in 2001 and upheld by the commission in 2004. Ryanair won its appeal in the European Court of Justice in 2008.

Ryanair said in a statement that it welcomes the rulings that were in its favour and will appeal the Zweibrucken decision, insisting that all of its airport arrangements comply with EU state aid rules.

Ryanair was cleared after investigations into its deals with four other European airports

The controversial carrier is currently in the middle of a charm offensive to win over customers and improve its public image. 

Regulators ruled on a number of complaints involving deals granted by regional authorities to attract budget airlines to secondary European airports.

The deals have fuelled the explosive growth of low-cost carriers and their success in competing with larger airlines.

Budget airline Germanwings has been ordered to repay almost £1m in subsidies from Zweibrucken Airport

Zweibrucken Airport, which is in insolvency proceedings and searching for an investor, has been ordered to repay around £36m in investment and operating aid to German authorities.

In other rulings, regulators ordered Zweibrucken Airport to recover £940,000 from Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings and £156,000 from fellow German budget carrier TUIfly.

The European Commission also warned Belgium that it may be giving unauthorised subsidies to Brussels Airlines.
