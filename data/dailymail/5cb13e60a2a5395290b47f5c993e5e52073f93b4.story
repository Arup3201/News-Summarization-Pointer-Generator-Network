How come men have all the fun letting their upper lips get super-hairy in November to raise money and awareness for prostate cancer charities?

When's our turn to embrace our hirsute side? Er, now.

Armpits4August is the female equivalent of Movember, a month during which women all over the UK (and further afield, too) are asked to celebrate their underarm hair and let it all hang - or rather, grow - out in order to raise money and awareness for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) charity Verity.

PCOS affects up to 10 per cent of women and a common symptom is excessive hair 
growth.

Now in its second year, the event was launched to celebrate feminine hairiness rather than shame it.

As well as raising money and awareness for the PCOS charity the group hope that the action, if picked up by enough women, will be successful in changing attitudes about body hair and femininity.

So did you let your armpit hair flourish this month? And how did you get on? And would you be brave enough to send us your photos?

Email us your hairiest photos - along with your name, age, location and how much you raised for charity - to femail@mailonline.co.uk

Did you manage to grow your underarm hair out as much as these women did?

Did you do as well as this growing out your underarm hair?

Razors? What razors? Armpits 4 August helps support women with PCOS, a condition which causes excessive hair growth
