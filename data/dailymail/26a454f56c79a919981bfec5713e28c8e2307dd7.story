The fireworks will also be aired to a billion people around the world through the use of drones, a world first arrangement.

The foreshore is expected to attract up to 1.6 million people, along with some 3000 police.

The dramatic 16 hours siege ended when police stormed the cafe in a burst of gunfire in a bid to free the hostages.

Mr Johnson, the cafe's 34-year-old manager, and 38-year-old lawyer Ms Dawson were killed in the gunfire, along with Monis.

Johnson was applauded for his bravery, after reports that he attempted tpo wrestle the gun away from Monis, allowing several captives to escape and ultimately sacrificing his life.

Last Tuesday, the two victims were remembered in private memorial services. Mr Johnson’s ceremony was held at a church, while Ms Dawson’s memorial was held at University of Sydney.
