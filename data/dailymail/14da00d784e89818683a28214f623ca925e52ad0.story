Americans paused on Friday to remember the lives lost at Sandy Hook Elementary School one week ago, when a 20-year-old gunman shot dead 20 children and 6 adults in a tragedy that has overwhelmed the nation.

As the quiet community of Newtown, Connecticut has laid to rest the innocent victims this week, the nation has struggled to know how best to support the town during this numbing time of grief. The families who lost their precious children and family members don't need shelter or clothing like victims in natural disasters but are instead grappling with the darkness of sorrow and loss after the unthinkable acts on December 14.

In response, a movement called 26 Acts of Kindness has been launched by NBC correspondent Ann Curry to overcome evil with kindness and young and old have jumped on the bandwagon to do good deeds in honor of the victims who died last week.

After the events of December 14, Ann Curry was among those who wondered what they could do to help.

She posed the question on her Facebook and Twitter accounts last weekend and proposed that if an act of kindness could be conducted for each life lost - then good could soon eclipse the wrong don.

She was inspired by the example of New York Giants player Victor Cruz, who reached out to the family of Jake Pinto, the 6-year-old Sandy Hook victim who was a big fan of the NFL player. Touched by Cruz's generosity, Curry challenged her fans to follow suit and reach out to someone in their community.

At first, the newscaster issued the 
challenge to honor the 20 children who were killed in the tragedy, 
starting the hashtag #20Acts, but it soon grew to honor all 26 victims 
who were killed at the school and has since turned into #26Acts.

Challenge: Wearing green, the school color of Sandy Hook Elementary School, Ann Curry made a YouTube video to challenge her fans to take action for good in remembrance of the lives lost on Dec. 14

What started as a gentle suggestion has turned into a movement that has convicted people across the country and across the globe to turn the tragedy into an occasion to offer kindness to others.

One mother of a first grader, Elizabeth Glass, from Annapolis Maryland, decided to offer free coffee to Newtown residents.

She called Newtown General Store and spoke to the store owner Pete Leone to make the offer, citing Curry's movement as her inspiration.

Leone told NBC News that he even had a call from someone in Afghanistan, offering to do what they could to comfort the grieving community.

'What's really remarkable to me is how many people responded. They are the ones who carried the ball. They are the ones who chose what to do,' Curry wrote in a heartfelt blog posting about the effort, that was also inspired by a trip she took to Darfur a few years ago.

'I know the truth: if you do good, you feel good,' she wrote, adding, 'Right now, this country wants to heal. I think the only thing comforting in the face of a tragedy like this is to do something good with it if you can. Be a part of that wave.'

Others have decided to make their mark in their own neighborhoods, offices, schools and communities.

Two employees at the Corona Cafe in Austin, Texas wrote the name of the Sandy Hook victims on 26 coffee cups - offering 26 free drinks for customers with each drink honoring one named victim.

In Indiana, local NBC newscasters decided to buy a stack of pizzas for their local United Way chapter to offer some encouragement to the employees at the non-profit.

And little children have also been inspired to offer a helping hand. One mother in San Francisco, Denise Maduli-Williams proudly tweeted a photo of her two children taking muffins to their neighbors as part of the 26 Acts cause.

Scores of others are purchasing toys, markers and books for needy children, bringing mittens to the homeless and taking time to volunteer to help others. 

The tragedy continues to overwhelm the country and the wave of kind acts has brought comfort to many who are just unsure of how to cope.

Officials accustomed to responding to natural disasters and other tragedies have said that the scene in Newtown is unlike anything they have experienced before. 

Since the families of the victims lost their loves ones at the hand of a gunman, there has been a feeling of despair at the inability to understand what could have possibly caused such evil.

Salvation Army national spokesperson Major Ron Busroe told the MailOnline that they had volunteers in the area on December 14 offering food to first responders but now they are focused on offering emotional and spiritual support.

Uniformed personnel from the organization have attended every funeral that has been held for the Newtown victims and officers have been on hand to offer a listening ear to those who want to talk about what they have experienced and are feeling.

'The Salvation Army uniform is recognized and in times of terrible hurt, people are looking for a way to be comforted. When they see and recognize the uniform, they know that there are people who are there to comfort,' he said.

Groups of churches across the country decided to make prayer shawls and those have been distributed to churches in the town, 'as a tangible reminder that there are people standing and praying' for the community, Major Busroe said.
