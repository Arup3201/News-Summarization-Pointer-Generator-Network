Last orders have been called on Ladies' Nights in Australia as bars are banned from giving free drinks to women.

The new law comes into force on January 18 in South Australia in an attempt by the the state government to tackle binge drinking.

It is one of a raft of 2013 laws being introduced in the country that critics say are unnecessary 'nannyism'.

Banned: Bars in South Australia will not be able to offer free drinks to women from January 18

In New South Wales new guidelines are being brought in to tell parents what to wear when they drop and collect their children from some schools.

Parents have been told not to wear revealing clothes such as bikinis or racist T-shirts.

One Sydney school said visitors should wear 'neat, casual clothing and footwear', according to The Telegraph.

In Victoria, smokers will be fined Â£89 ($140) if they light up within 164 feet of the beach and in New South Wales a smoke-free radius will be installed around parks.

A ban on tanning salons will also come into force in the state from today.

Critics of the new measures say they are unnecessary and excessive.

Terry O'Gormon, president of The Australian Council for Civil Liberties, told The Australian that laws are already in place to prevent drunk people being served more alcohol in bars.

He said: 'If there is a problem, it lies with the enforcement.'

Under the new alcohol laws, bars must offer free water to customers.

However many bars are expected to include men in their promotions to sidestep the ban.

The manager of PJ O'Briens bar in Adelaide told The Telegraph: 'As long as you offer the special deals to everyone, it is OK.

'We will still look after everyone. Everything we're doing is by the book.'
