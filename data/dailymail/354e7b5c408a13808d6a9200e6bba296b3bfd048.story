We're told to eat less if we want to reduce our waistlines.

And when it comes to Mars and Snickers treats we’ll be doing just that from now on whether we like it or not… but the manufacturer claims it’s all for our own good.

Mars UK is shrinking the size of its two most popular bars again and it says it is doing so to help quell the obesity crisis.

However, the move will actually make our purses lighter as the price is staying the same.

Shrinking bars: Both Mars and Snickers bars have been reduced in size by more than 10 per cent but the recommended selling price has remained the same

The company said the decision to reduce 
Mars from 58g to 51g and Snickers from 58g to 48g is part of a pledge to
 cut the calorie count of its products to a maximum of 250. A spokesman 
added: ‘To meet our commitment, having taken product reformulation as 
far as we can for now without compromising the great taste, we have 
reduced the portion size of Mars and Snickers to bring down the 
calories.’

Mars will now have 229 calories and Snickers will have 245.

In 2008, the company also reduced the bars’ size, from 62.5g to 58g.

The chocolate giant committed early in 2012 to cut the calorie content of its single-serve products to a maximum of 250 calories by the end of 2013 as part of its calorie reduction Responsibility Deal pledge.

As a result of the size changes, the number of calories in a Mars bar has dropped from 260 to 229 and in a Snickers bar from 280 to 245.

Mars said it had little choice but to reduce the size of the products because there was a limit to what could now be achieved through reformulation. In 2010, it cut the saturated fat content of a Mars bar by 15 per cent and removed all transfats.

A Mars spokesman told The Grocer: 'As part of our global commitment to promote responsible consumption, and as a signatory of the Responsibility Deal's calorie reduction pledge, we said we would ensure that all our single-serve chocolate products would contain no more than 250 calories per portion.

'To meet our commitment, having taken product reformulation as far as we can for now without compromising the great taste, we have reduced the portion size of Mars and Snickers to bring down the calorie content.'

The Grocer magazine says that it is not the first time that Mars has reduced the size of Mars and Snickers. In 2008, it cut the size of both products from 62.5g to 58g while leaving the price the same.

Mars has reduced the size of the bars in the wake of big hikes in the cost of chocolate-making over the past decade and cost inflation was particularly severe this year.

Mars bars have been reduced from 58g to 51g to ensure they contain less than 250 calories

In analysis for The Grocer in October, commodity pricing specialists Mintec said that cost of producing an average milk chocolate bar had soared by 25 per cent year-on-year, adding 6p to the cost of making a 100g bar of plain milk chocolate.

The main culprit for soaring costs was the rocketing price of cocoa butter which has been hit by adverse weather in the Ivory Coast - one of the most important growing countries.

In March this year, researchers from consumer watchdog Which? discovered that big name food producers have reduced pack sizes by as much as a quarter without reducing the price.

They found that 'underhand' and 'hidden price hikes' were on many items including frozen foods, bags of sweets and crisps and dishwasher tablets.

Which? said many everyday products now offer poorer value for money because of the 'hidden price hikes'.

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'Shrinking products can be an underhand way of raising prices because pack sizes shrink but the prices don't.

'We want simpler pricing so people can easily compare products to see which is the cheapest, and for special offers to be genuine.'

When the magazine asked the makers of these products why they had shrunk them, they were generally told that, in the face of rising costs they chose to shrink products rather than increase prices.

But a survey of 1,257 Which? members found that well over half - 58 per cent - said they would rather prices rose than packs got smaller. A further 37 per cent would rather the pack shrank, but only if they were told.

Earlier this year, former public health minister Anna Soubry described Mars' calorie reduction pledge as ' absolutely brilliant.' She told The Grocer: 'They don't have to do it but are doing it for all the right reasons.'
