A teenager who was smashed over the head with a bottle of champagne after she spurned the advances of a thug in a nightclub has revealed the facial injuries she suffered in the attack.

Monique Henville, 19, was approached by the man while she was drinking with her friends in a nightclub.

He poured champagne over head after she refused to speak to him and then lost his temper when she continued to ignore him.

Monique said she was unable to speak or eat for six weeks following the attack

He then smashed the bottle of champagne he was drinking across her face.

Monique was left needing five hours of reconstructive surgery after the force of the blow shattered her teeth and jaw.

She said: 'There was a big chunk out of one side of my jaw and the other side was shattered.

'I had two operations and they had to put a plate in and bolts and a wire for my teeth.

'I couldn’t speak and I couldn’t eat for six weeks and I am not being funny but I love my food.

'I was lucky there are no permanent scars but I have to have a plate in for the rest of my life. I just want the police to catch him before he does it again. It was so scary.

Police have released a picture of a man they would like to speak to (left) in connection with the attack on Monique (right)

'I don’t go out anymore because of what happened. It is too scary.'

Police have now released an image of a man they would like to speak to in connection with the assault at 1.45am on Saturday, July 20, in the Ballare club in Cambridge.

PC Fergus Cowley said: 'This was an unprovoked attack that left the victim needing surgery to her face.

'I would urge anyone with information to come forward.'
