Holidaymakers were forced to rush for cover after a runaway horse and carriage careered through a packed seaside town and smashed into a car.

The horse-drawn cart was being driven through the busy streets of Swanage, Dorset, when crowds spooked the horse and it bolted.

The 20-year-old at the reins of the out-of-control cart was thrown 30ft after the carriage crashed intoÂ  a car.

Panic: Holiday makers were forced to rush for cover after a runaway horse and carriage careered through Swanage High Street and crashed into a car

Accident: The horse-drawn cart was being driven through the packed streets when crowds spooked the horse and it bolted

Both the horse and the four-wheeled cart were thrown onto their sides, narrowly missing passing bystanders.

Incredibly the cart driver, the female car driver and the horse all escaped unscathed.

Emergency services rushed to the scene at Swanage High Street where they treated both drivers for shock.

It took eight firefighters to right the 110-year-old carriage, which had only just been restored by its owner.

The shaken horse was recovered by members of the public.

Onlooker Archie Wright, who was working at nearby fish and chip shop The Fish Plaice, said: 'The first thing we knew about it was when we heard a huge crash.

Fortunate: Incredibly the cart driver, the female car driver and the horse all escaped unscathed

Concern: This CCTV footage from the Ship Inn shows the shock on drinkers' faces as the runaway carriage careers down the high street

'We all looked round and saw the cart fly up in the air.

'It seems like something spooked the horse and it bolted. The driver of the cart lost control and careered into two cars.

'As soon as it happened there were about 200 people out on the street.

'Thankfully no-one was hurt.'

Swanage resident Brian Erksine added: 'The town is packed with tourists at this time of year so it's a wonder more people weren't hurt.

'It was quite a shocking sight.'

Phil Burridge, Swanage Fire Station 
commander, said: 'The horse had been pulling the cart down through the 
High Street when it got scared and bolted.

Accident: Firefighters attempt to push the carriage back up following the collision

Lucky: With the streets packed with holidaymakers - including many small children - it was extremely fortunate that nobody was hurt

'It smashed straight into the side of a car severely damaging it.

'The cart flipped over and sent its driver flying about 30ft.

'Luckily there were no passengers in the cart at the time.

'Ambulance crews treated the female car driver for shock and the cart driver was treated for cuts and bruises.

'The cart itself is 110 years old and its owner had only just finished restoring it.

'It took eight firefighters to get it upright again.

'The most important thing is no-one was hurt. Cars and carts can be replaced but human lives can't.'
