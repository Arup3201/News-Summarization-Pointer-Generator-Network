As well as proving that we will wear pretty much anything in the name of fashion - including what can only described as an adult baby-gro  - the onesie kickstarted a trend for ironic, playful fashion.

Celebrities such as Cara Delevingne and Harry Styles couldn't get enough of them and fuelled huge demand from the public.

However, according to the high street, the comic all-in-one has had its day.

Stores like M&S are set to offer a wide range of Christmas knitwear this season to supply the growing demand

Yes, it's time to shrug off that one-piece, this year is all about the continuing comeback of novelty knitwear - the weirder and wackier the better.

From outlandish frosty the snowman designs to a Rudolph with a battery-powered flashing nose, it's no longer unusual to see grown men and women walking around in eye-catching festive fare, spurred on in part by charity drives such as sponsored ‘Christmas Jumper at work’ days.

And the trend looks set to continue to rise, with Sainsbury’s, who sold a Christmas jumper every 22 seconds last year ordering five times more stock this year in preparation.

Speaking to MailOnline Marie Jones, Head of Design M&S Collection comments: 'Christmas jumpers sold out last year as soon as they hit stores and with the fantastic breath of offer for this festive season no doubt they will be best sellers.'

Model Cara Delevingne was a well known onesie lover, favouring the more outlandish designs 

Worn by the likes of Justin Bieber, the onesie looks to be usurped from the top spot by novelty knitwear 

But if you thought that however garish a knitted hat or jumper, it can't be as bad as elephant, tiger and bunny onesies, think again.

Novelty twosies - or matching top and bottom tracksuits - are also predicted to be a hit.

Speaking to the Guardian, James Brown of Sainsbury's says: 'We don't really see a growth this year in onesies. It will more about the two-piece and outfits that match head-to-toe.'

Creating the same effect as the onesie but with the added advantage of making it a bit easier to go to the toilet, it seems we may soon see entire families kitted out in matching knitwear.

Speaking to the Guardian, a spokesperson from Asda, who have increased their ordering of festive knits by 62 per cent from last year says: 'We are going after the whole family: mum, dad, the kids and the dog.'
