Following a University of Tennessee student’s near death after undergoing a so-called alcohol enema the school has suspended the campus fraternity until at least 2015.

The Pi Kappa Alpha house on Knoxville's campus will close on Oct. 7 with the national fraternity notified by the university on Friday that it is voluntarily surrendering its charter.

Knoxville Police said that one fraternity member was admitted to the hospital earlier this week with a dangerously high level of intoxication after undergoing what students call 'butt chugging.' A dozen people were later cited for underage drinking.

Brink of death: Alexander Broughton, 20, was given an 'alcohol enema' during a frat party at the University of Tennessee according to police

Twenty-year-old Alexander P. Broughton has denied that that he received an alcohol enema, though police records dispute that claim. Broughton's father has said his son has recovered and returned to classes.

Thanks to the fraternity's drunken exploits, the bizarre way of getting drunk is giving parents, administrators and health care workers a new fear.

When Broughton was delivered to the hospital after midnight on Sept. 22, his blood alcohol level was measured at 0.448 per cent — nearly six times the intoxication that defines drunken driving in the state. Injuries to his rectum led hospital officials to fear he had been sodomized.

Police documents show that when an officer interviewed a fellow fraternity member about what happened, the student said the injuries had been caused by an alcohol enema, known among students as 'butt chugging.'

'It is believed that members of the fraternity were utilizing rubber tubing inserted into their rectums as a conduit for alcohol,' according to a police report.

While Broughton told police he remembered participating in a drinking game with fellow members of the Pi Kappa Alpha chapter, he denied having an alcohol enema. Police concluded otherwise from evidence they found at the frat house, including boxes of Franzia Sunset Blush wine.

Investigators also found three other students passed out in their rooms from drinking.

'He also had no recollection of 
losing control of his bowels and defecating on himself,' according to a 
university police report that includes photos of the mess left behind in
the fraternity house after the party.

Broughton did not respond to a cellphone message seeking comment on Friday.

The university responded with swift 
investigation and a decision on Friday to shutter the fraternity. The 
national Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity organization also accepted the 
withdrawal of the campus charter.

Alcohol enemas have been the punch lines
of YouTube videos, a stunt in a 'Jackass' movie and a song by the punk 
band NOFX called 'Party Enema.' But Corey Slovis, chairman of department
of emergency medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said 
actually going through with the deed can have severe consequences.

'It's something that offers no advantages, while at the same time risking someone's life,' he said.

The procedure bypasses the stomach, accelerating the absorption rate, Slovis said. Pouring the alcohol through a funnel can increase the amount of alcohol consumed because it's hard to gauge how much is going in.

'When you're dumping it into your rectum, often via a funnel, one or two ounces seems like such a minuscule amount,' he said. Ingesting more can create unconsciousness quite quickly, he explained.

The effects have been fatal in at least one case.

An autopsy performed after the death of a 58-year-old Texas man in 2004 showed he had been given an enema with enough sherry to have a blood alcohol level of 0.47 per cent. Negligent homicide charges were later dropped against his wife, who said she gave him the enema.

Students walking across campus this week generally responded with sighs and eye rolls when asked about the allegations.

'It's like a big joke,' said Erica Davis, a freshman from Hendersonville. 'Because who does that?'

Gordon Ray, a senior from Morristown, said the details of the case caught him off guard, but not the fact that fraternity members would be overdoing it with alcohol.

'It is definitely over the top,' said Ray. 'But it doesn't surprise me, I don't guess.'

The harm the news has done to the university's national reputation was on the mind of several students.

'If someone wants to be stupid, then they should do it where it won't affect anyone else,' said Marlon Alessandra, freshman from Independence, Va.

James E. Lange, who coordinates alcohol and drug abuse prevention strategies at San Diego State University, said alcohol enemas aren't a common occurrence on campuses, though normal consumption still contributes to hundreds of student deaths annually. And many of those can be attributed to reckless attitudes about the consequences of heavy drinking, he said.

'It's not unusual to hear that students are drinking to get drunk,' he said.

Lange said he hopes students don't draw the wrong lessons from the University of Tennessee incident.

'Students and people in general are pretty good at denying that they are at risk for whatever happened to someone else,' he said. 'So they can look at something like this and say 'I'm OK because I would never do that.'

'However, they may be drinking heavily, or doing things like mixing alcohol with prescription meds that is putting them at serious risk,' he said.

To Tennessee freshman Cody Privett of Sevierville, there's nothing appealing about the incident on his campus.

'It's stupid, it's an unfortunate situation,' said Privett, of Sevierville. 'I mean there's partying, and then there's other things.'

It is not the first time the PIKE chapter has been involved in trouble at the university.

In
2008, the chapter was placed on administrative suspension after a 
hazing incident where pledges were allegedly asked to do push-ups on 
broken glass.

Three 
students were later hospitalized with staph infections. A member of the 
fraternity said pledges were asked perform a 'lateral ab movement' known
as 'bows and toes' on the bathroom floor.

The university's Office of Student Judicial Affairs charged the chapter with hazing and it pleaded guilty.

After
completing its suspension, the chapter served several months of 
probation. The international PIKE organization investigated and kicked 
out 25 of the chapter's active members.
