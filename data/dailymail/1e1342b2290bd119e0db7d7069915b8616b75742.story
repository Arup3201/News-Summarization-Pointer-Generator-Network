Police were sent on a wild goose chase around the streets of Sheffield in a bid to capture a giant emu which was spotted marauding through the city's streets.

Eddie the bird was seen brazenly wandering around a residential area after escaping from a nearby farm, just before the early-morning commuter rush.

Officers managed to contain the inquisitive bird in a garden and began contacting nearby farms and animal attractions to try and track down the emu's owner.

They then tried contacting local smallholdings and eventually found the emu's home.

The couple looking after the bird - who live on a 30-acre farm - had only recently started caring for the emu after a friend was no longer able to look after the pet.

Dawn Critchlow, 46, said: 'He'd only been with us a day when he took off. He didn't get very far.

'I'm looking after him for a friend who is not very well. We found him in someone's garden eating carrots.'

Dawn said 18-month-old Eddie's owner also had geese, chickens and a skunk.

She added: 'He is back with us now - and he's locked up.'

Inspector Jason Booth, from South Yorkshire Police, said: 'You couldn't make it up. Who would have thought we would have been dealing with a mystery emu when we turned up?

'We started ringing local farms and people with smallholdings in the area and eventually found the owner.

'They had only recently taken possession of it from a friend who could no longer look after it.

'It was quite early when it was reported to us so I don't think they had realised it was missing but they came with a horse box and took it back.

'It certainly demonstrates the variety of police work and we are just pleased that there was a happy ending.

'The emu was kept safe, it didn't get loose on to the roads and it has been reunited with its owner.'
