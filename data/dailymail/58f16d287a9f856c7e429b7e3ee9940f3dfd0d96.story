An ink sketch by Beatle John Lennon - drawn in a 'light-bulb moment' - is expected to sell for thousands of pounds in an online auction next month.

The drawing has officially been valued at between £6,000 and £10,000, but an expert has said previous artistic works by Lennon have sold for £100,000 and that this offering could 'go through the roof'.

The double-sided doodle, which features surreal characters in red ink on both sides of a piece of paper, measuring five inches by ten, was hand-drawn by the late musician in 1964.

The double-sided doodle, on a piece of paper measuring fives inches by ten, was drawn by Lennon in 1964

Music memorabilia expert Ted Owen said: ‘What’s lovely about it is he’s obviously been sitting down at the dinner table or out to dinner somewhere, picked up a piece of paper and had an idea.

‘It’s the lightbulb moment. This took him into a whole different genre of being an artist.’

The front of the paper features three characters, including one smoking a cigarette. The reverse side has varying forms of head and face shapes.

Similar characters appeared in Lennon’s book, In His Own Right, which was produced in 1964.

The doodles will be sold in a frame with a copy of the book and a promotional photograph, showing all four Beatles, at its press launch.

It will be auctioned on Cashintheattic.com on December 4.

Mr Owen said: ‘What’s nice about this is that it’s early. It’s before he started marketing his artwork.

The sketch was drawn by Lennon in 1964, the year that The Beatles conquered America

'What a lot of people don’t recognise is that John Lennon was a brilliant artist in his own right. Some of his work fetches up to £100,000.

'I
would reckon that it’s got to be somewhere in excess of six, seven, 
eight, nine or ten thousand – it’s a wide estimate but it’s rare. It 
could go through the roof.’

Lennon's sketches are not the first of the band's doodles to go up for auction.

A
rudimentary doodle drawn by Paul McCartney when he was a teenager in 
the late 1950s fetched £3,764 when it was sold in March this year.

In May 2011 John Lennon's handwritten lyrics for the song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, including a rough sketch by Lennon of four people in a room with windows draped in curtains, sold for £145,644 in a US auction.

And in June 2010 Lennon's handwritten lyrics for Beatles hit A Day In The Life sold for £810,273.78 when they went under the hammer.

A scrapbook autographed by The Beatles recently sold at auction for £3,200.

The book was owned by a young fan who met the fab four backstage during a recording of 'Thank Your Lucky Stars.'

It was snapped by an American at the sale in Wareham, Dorset.

The winning bidder, who did not want to be named, said: 'I have never bid in an auction before, but have loved the Beatles since I was three.

'I will never sell them and intend to leave them to my niece if anything happens to me.'

The Beatles perform on the Ed Sullivan Show in New York

In 1964, the year that John Lennon drew his prized sketch, The Beatles had become international stars and were embarking on their first ever world tour playing to thousands of hysterical fans in Europe, Australia and Hong Kong. 

As Beatlemania hit its peak, the group took the US by storm, leading the 'British Invasion' of the US pop market.

On February 7, the group  left Heathrow airport to the sound of four thousand fans waving and screaming as their plane took off for New York.

Shortly after their arrival, the band famously performed on The Ed Sullivan Show, watched by approximately 73 million viewers, and managed to achieve six simultaneous songs in the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks in April of that year - a record no other act has managed to equal.

It was in 1964 that The Beatles played themselves in mock-documentary A Hard Day's Night, which premiered in London in July.

They had already released the accompanying album of the same name, which featured hits including its eponynmous title track and And I Love Her, followed in December with Beatles For Sale, their fourth album in just 21 months which included the track Eight Days A Week.

In August the group were introduced to Bob Dylan, a meeting which would go on to have an influence the future musical output of both acts.

Lennon was still married to his first wife Cynthia during this period, and the couple had their son Julian the year earlier. Lennon had been encouraged to keep both the marriage and child a secret from fans as manager Brian Epstein feared it could threaten the ban's commercial success.
