Founded in 1823, the world’s most famous debating society has proved a valuable training ground for many future politicians.

But the brightest young minds in the country packed out the Oxford Union last week to discuss whether Yorkshire puddings should be served with roast chicken.

The union - which has hosted former prime ministers, top sportsmen and actors among other high-profile names - argued whether it is wrong to serve the puddings with just roast beef.

The long-held tradition was talked about being ‘outdated and out of touch’ with modern British life, the room of more than 300 members and future politicians claimed.

Passions ran high as the debate heard that Yorkshire puddings now also have a ‘rightful place’ on a plate with roast chicken.

Meanwhile others argued British traditions need to be ‘treasured, upheld and preserved’ during the hour-long discussion.

 The Oxford Union has a reputation for bringing international guests and speakers to debate in its halls.

Previous guests include the Dalai Lama, Mother Teresa, former US presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, and ex-prime ministers Sir John Major and Winston Churchill.

Formula One racing legend Sir Jackie Stewart, actress Dame Judi Dench, theoretical physicist Albert Einstein and author and presenter Stephen Fry have also spoken at the debating society.

The Yorkshire pudding discussion made a change from the usual cut and thrust debate of world politics.

Last month, new research by Aunt Bessie’s found that more Yorkshire puddings are now being eaten with roast chicken than with roast beef on British dinner tables.

As a result, the Oxford Union decided to deem whether this was now a ‘socially acceptable’ thing to do.

Oxford Union spokesman Mayank Banerjee said: ‘Whilst the majority of our debates focus on world affairs, we do have a lighter side, and debates about popular culture can become quite fierce.

‘This is our first foodie debate and might well pave the way for more in the future.’

To help spark the debate, the students first tucked into a roast chicken dinner with Aunt Bessie’s Yorkshire puddings.

‘Mums see a role for Yorkshire puddings irrespective of whether it’s beef or chicken and often face complaints from family members if they are left off the menu.

‘We’re pleased that some of Oxford Union’s greatest minds are in agreement.’

The union’s membership is drawn primarily but not exclusively from the University of Oxford.
