Motorists could pay almost £200 a year more for petrol when a new green fuel is introduced in line with EU rules, experts have warned.

Their tests show the new blend of unleaded petrol can make cars up to 11.3 per cent less efficient, increase CO2 exhaust emissions and even ruin the engines of some older vehicles.

It is set to be introduced because of an EU directive saying that major suppliers must add environmentally friendly alternatives to petrol.

Many oil companies have decided to use bio-ethanol, made from corn, sugar cane and rapeseed.

The new eco-fuel, E10, contains 10 per cent bio-ethanol, compared with up to 5 per cent in the E5 unleaded blend currently on sale.

The Renewable Energy Directive requires 5 per cent of road transport energy to be from renewable sources this year, and 10 per cent by 2020, in an attempt to cut greenhouse gas emissions linked to global warming.

But while ethanol burns more cleanly than petrol, it supplies around 30 per cent less energy. This means cars will use more of the new fuel, costing drivers more.

Tests by motoring magazine What Car? found that big, powerful cars coped better, while the small-engined models often bought by families on a budget were the worst affected.

Its tests showed cars’ fuel economy fell by as much as 11.3 per cent, and by 8.4 per cent on average, with E10 compared to pure unleaded petrol.

That is the equivalent of two extra full tanks a year, or £170 assuming both fuels cost the same, it said.

The report added: ‘Apply this to all compatible cars and you’re looking at a national annual fuel bill hike of £3.4billion.’

When the new fuel was compared with E5, it said, ‘the effect would be smaller but still significant’.

Tests in the US – where car engines tend to be far bigger – showed falls in fuel economy of only 3 to 4 per cent.

Not every car can use E10, which can melt, corrode and wreck some components in older engines.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and 
Traders said 92 per cent of UK cars are compatible with E10, but that 
leaves around 1.5million vehicles, mostly those built before 2002, 
potentially at risk.

What Car? said ethanol acts as a solvent and can cause fuel pump, hose filter and injector blockages.

It is also corrosive to some seals, plastics and metals ‘and can lead to fuel leaks and even engine failure’.

The fuel leads to increased CO2 emissions from car exhaust pipes. However, green groups such as the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership say this would be offset since crops used to make it absorb CO2 as they grow.

What Car? editor Chas Hallett called on the Government to carry out its own tests.

He said: ‘To lead consumers into E10 without fully communicating the significant impact on fuel economy, particularly for drivers least able to absorb extra costs, is irresponsible.’

Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said it was up to fuel sellers to decide how to meet EU targets.

She said: ‘Any decision to supply E10 is very much a commercial decision for fuel suppliers and current regulations certainly do not require them to do this.’

Petrol Retailers’ Association spokesman Philip Monger said: ‘I’d prefer to see it delayed.’

Forecourts selling three million litres of fuel or more a year will have to offer both E5 and E10 until 2017, though many smaller sites will have to choose which to provide.

Pumps dispensing fuel with more than 5 per cent ethanol, such as E10, must be clearly labelled that it is not suitable for all vehicles.
