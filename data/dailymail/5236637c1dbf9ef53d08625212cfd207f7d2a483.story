Luis Felipe Scolari looked troubled as he held talks with the head of the Brazilian Football Federation on Thursday before injured star Neymar paid a visit to the training ground.

The 65-year-old is under increasing pressure after his side were thrashed 7-1 by Germany in the World Cup semi-finals on Tuesday night, but was given a warm embrace by the Selecao favourite.

Scolari, who is preparing the host nation for the third place play-off against Holland, was spotted deep in conversation with Jose Maria Marin at the training ground.

At one point he was seen gesturing with his hand before he placed it across his face in an act of apparent despair.

The former Chelsea boss refused to quit on Wednesday, saying he will wait until after the tournament to decide his future.

'We have a deal with the CBF until the game on Saturday and after that, probably, we will have a conversation to sort some things out,' he said.

'The tournament was not all bad. We had a bad defeat. With all the difficulties we reached the semi-finals. We are a hard-working team, we win together and lose together.

'The crash was also the coaching staff, the fans, it was overall, no one understood, and the team from Germany, which is good, took the opportunity.

'I cannot explain, I will not justify. An error occurred and this error was fatal.

'If I could explain what happened in those six minutes, I would answer. But I do not know.

'We can lose by one or two but we lost in a way that we had never done before in the history of Brazilian football.'

Earlier on Thursday, Scolari was called 'an old jerk' and 'repulsive' by injured star Neymar's agent.

Ribeiro produced a list of 'six requirements to be Brazilian coach' and proceeded to belittle many achievements in Scolari's managerial career.

He wrote on his Twitter account: 'One - being Portugal Coach and winning nothing.'

'Two - going to Chelsea and being sacked the following day.'

'Three - going to coach in Uzbekistan.'

'Four - returning to Brazil, taking over a big team [Palmeiras] and getting them relegated to the second division.'

'Five - leaving the club 56 days before the end of the Brasileirao [season] to 'escape' the relegation.

'Six - being an old jerk, arrogant, repulsive, conceited and ridiculous.'

Ribeiro's outburst seemed to echo public opinion after Brazil's heavy defeat to Germany.

The final whistle had barely sounded when the media turned on the Selecao.

Some newspapers said they 'learned what real shame is', others told Scolari to 'go to hell', and another told their readers to write their own front page.

And their damning analysis of Brazil's performance reached the people, too, after every copy of every newspaper sold out at Belo Horizonte airport.
