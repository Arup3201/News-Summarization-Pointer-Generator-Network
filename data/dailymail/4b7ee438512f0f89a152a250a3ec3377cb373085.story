Camels, goats, cows and donkeys carrying explosives  could be used in deadly attacks by Nigerian terror group Boko Haram.

Intelligence reports gathered by Nigerian's security agencies reveal the group is planning to use the livestock in busy public places, the country's government has warned.

Youngsters disguised as cobblers hiding explosives in their tool boxes are also set to be used in the terror attacks.

Brutal: Boko Haram is believed to have killed more than 10,000 people in 2014 alone and now plans to use livestock carrying explosives to murder more innocent people have emerged

Mike Omeri, coordinator of Nigeria's National Information Center, said: 'Available intelligence reports indicate a plan by Boko Haram to use young male suicide bombers disguised as cobblers to hide explosives in their tool boxes and detonate them in soft target areas such as markets, restaurants, ATM locations, political rallies, worship centres, as well as other public places.

'Also there is indication of a plan by this group to use livestock, such as goats, cows, donkeys and camels, laden with explosives to attack chosen targets. 

'In view of these, the general public, including all persons operating within and around the aforementioned places, is advised to be vigilant and mindful of suspicious activities within their environment.'

The warning came yesterday as Chad sent a warplane dropping bombs and ground troops to drive Islamic extremists from Malumfatori village in Nigeria's Borno state, leaving it strewn with the bodies of the Islamic extremists.

Thursday's bombing marked the first such action by foreign troops on Nigerian soil to fight Boko Haram.

To further help Nigeria battle its extremists, the African Union (AU) moved to send ground forces and the U.S. said it would assist. 

The union chair, at an AU summit in Ethiopia, called for deployment of 7,500 West African troops to fight the spreading uprising by Nigeria's home-grown extremists.   

Boko Haram's uprising has killed about 10,000 people in the last year and displaced 1 million people. 

Human Rights Watch has previously warned that boys and girls kidnapped by the terrorist group were being used during their attacks

This week it was revealed the terrorists are training child soldiers how to use semi-automatic weapons.

The group released pictures showing more than a dozen children posing with, and learning how to aim, AK-47's.

The images appear to have been taken in northern Nigeria where Boko Haram has committed most of its attacks. 

They were published online by Al Urwa al Wuthaqa, a media group that has been associated with the insurgents, and come months after Human Rights Watch warned that boys and girls kidnapped by the terrorist group were being used during their attacks.
