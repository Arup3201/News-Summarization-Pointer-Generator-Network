It might not be the most stunning image to come out of space, but this picture has got astronomers very excited.

This misshapen circle and accompanying dot are the first ever image to be taken of a planet orbiting a star over 63 light years from Earth.

If light travels 5.88 trillion miles in a single year, then this is an image of a planet 370.44 trillion miles away.

Gemini Planet Imager's first light image of Beta Pictoris b, a planet orbiting the star Beta Pictoris. The star, Beta Pictoris, is blocked in this image by a mask so its light doesn't interfere with the light of the planet. Beta Pictoris b is a giant planet - several times larger than Jupiter - and is approximately ten million years old

The image was taken by the world's most powerful planet-hunting instrument, the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI), and is of a 10-million-year-old planet named Beta Pictorus b.

Gemini has been under development for nearly a decade, but this is only the first image to be released by the instrument.

Scientists claim it is the most advanced such instrument to be deployed on one of the world’s biggest telescopes – the eight-meter Gemini South telescope in Chile.

‘Even these early first-light images are almost a factor of 10 better than the previous generation of instruments,’ said Bruce Macintosh of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who led the team that built the instrument.

The Gemini Planet Imager is the world's most advanced planet hunting instrument built for the Gemini Telescope in Chile.

It is designed to image extrasolar planets orbiting nearby stars. In 2011, the GPI Exoplanet Survey team was selected to carry out an 890-hour survey campaign from 2014 to 2016 to search and characterise exoplanets around 600 stars.

GPI, which is the size of a small car, 
detects infrared radiation from young Jupiter-like planets in wide 
orbits around other stars, equivalent to the giant planets in our own solar system not long after their formation.

It does this using silicon microchip deformable mirrors to remove atmospheric turbulence, and something known as coronagraphic masks - a telescopic attachment designed to block out the direct light from a star so that nearby objects.

‘In one minute, we are seeing planets that used to take us an hour to detect.’

GPI, which is the size of a small car, detects infrared radiation from young Jupiter-like planets in wide orbits around other stars, equivalent to the giant planets in our own Solar System not long after their formation.

‘Most planets that we know about to date are only known because of indirect methods that tell us a planet is there, a bit about its orbit and mass, but not much else,’ said Professor Macintosh.

‘With GPI we directly image planets around stars – it’s a bit like being able to dissect the system and really dive into the planet’s atmospheric makeup and characteristics.’

For GPI’s first observations, the team targeted previously known planetary systems, including the well-known Beta Pictoris system.

They were also able to detect starlight scattered by tiny particles to study a faint ring of dust orbiting the very young star HR4796A 200 lights years from Earth.

This dust ring which may be the debris remaining from planet formation and with previous instruments, only the edges of it could be seen.

Although GPI was designed to look at distant planets, it can also observe objects in our solar system.

This image of Jupiter’s moon Europa, for instance, can allow scientists to map changes in the satellite’s surface composition.

‘Seeing a planet close to a star after just one minute, was a thrill, and we saw this on only the first week after the instrument was put on the telescope,’ said Fredrik Rantakyro a Gemini staff scientist working on the instrument.

‘Imagine what it will be able to do once we tweak and completely tune its performance.’

This year, the GPI team will begin a large-scale survey, looking at 600 young stars to see what giant planets orbit them.

Looking through Earth’s turbulent atmosphere, even with advanced adaptive optics, GPI will only be able to see Jupiter-sized planets. But similar technology is being proposed for future space telescopes.

Professor Macintosh predicts that ‘someday, there will be an instrument that will look a lot like GPI, on a telescope in space.

‘And the images and spectra that will come out of that instrument will show a little blue dot that is another Earth.’
