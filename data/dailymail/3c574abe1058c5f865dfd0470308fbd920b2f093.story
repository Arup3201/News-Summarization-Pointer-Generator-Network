A 12-year-old girl gave the store Dick's Sporting Goods a dose of girl power after receiving their catalog and noticing there were no female basketball players featured.

McKenna Peterson, the daughter of reporter Chris Paterson of AZCentral Sports and NBC12 wrote a fiery letter to Dick's about the lack of women players in their Basketball 2014 catalog.

Peterson tweeted a photo of his daughter's well-written letter and hundreds flocked to social media to give the young girl their support, reports Business Insider. 

Girl power: McKenna Paterson, 12, wrote a letter to Dick's Sporting Goods about them not featuring female basketball players in their catalog and says she herself is a basketball player 

'I think that girls should be treated as equally as boys are treated,' she writes.

Peterson details in her letter how she is a fan of women’s [professional basketball teams such as the Phoenix Mercury.

I don't know if you are keeping track of the ladies sports world but they are the Western Conference Champions AND the League Champions of 2014. They have at least two of the best players in the WORLD,' she writes.

The team has talented players such as Diana Taurasi and Brittney Griner.

'So, back to the point,There are NO girls in the catalog! Oh, wait, sorry. There IS a girl in the catalog. SITTING in the STANDS, ‘she boldly points out.

With pictures of girls sitting on the stands, Peterson says it makes it difficult for girls to break into sports generally associated with men.

The letter: 'So, back to the point,There are NO girls in the catalog! Oh, wait, sorry. There IS a girl in the catalog. SITTING in the STANDS,' she says in this letter to Dick's Sporting Goods 

Girls are also only mentioned two times in the catalog on a page talking about shoes and once on a page with cheerleaders.

'It's hard enough for girls to break through in this sport as it is, without you guys excluding us from your catalog,' she writes.

She then reminds the store that she loves shopping there but may be tempted to visit a store with greater respect towards gender equality.

'Maybe my dad will take me to some other store that supports girls to actually PLAY basketball and follow their dreams and not sit on the side-lines and watch the game,' she writes in a warning tone.

Peterson says, however, that she hopes she doesn't have to resort to going to another establishment because she truly likes shopping at Dick's.

'If you actually read this far,' she adds, 'thank you for your time and I look forward to seeing girls in the next basketball catalog you send out. I really DO enjoy going to your store and getting new shoes. The staff are very friendly and kind.'

She then ends her letter both politely and does so while asserting confidence.

'Sincerely, McKenna Peterson, The Fabulous Basketball Player.'

Not only is McKenna a fabulous basketball player she’s an inspiration for teenagers to speak up and say what's on their minds.
