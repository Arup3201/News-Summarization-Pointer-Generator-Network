A cruel thief stooped to a new low when he stole a brand new pink teddy bear from a four-year-old girl.

Tilly Donaghey, was left heartbroken after a criminal snatched her ballet-shoe wearing bear in a city centre street in Leiceser.

The little girl had barely enough time to rename her cuddly friend Princess Tilly before the opportunist criminal grabbed it from the pushchair next to her.

Painful: Tilly Donaghey, was left heartbroken after a criminal snatched her ballet-shoe wearing bear in a city centre street in Leiceser

Tilly had pleaded in the weeks leading up to her birthday for a 'pink princess bear' and when she was given £40 on the big day she begged her mum Correen to take her on a shopping trip.

On Tuesday, the family visited the Build-a-Bear store in Highcross, Leicester, and the youngster spent her money on her perfect teddy.

However, just seconds after the excited child and her mum had left the store, the bear was taken.

Mum Correen, 25, said: 'I’d stopped to look in a shop window and Tilly had put the bear in the pushchair.

'The next thing I knew, she was looking round for it and saying she couldn’t find it.

'I didn’t see anyone take it. They must have done it really quickly because one minute it was there and the next it was gone.'

After searching for the teddy without success, Correen took her distraught daughter home and called the police.

Correen said: 'She was devastated, she kept saying ‘a naughty man has taken my bear’ and she was crying all night.

'I don’t know how anyone could steal a teddy from a four-year-old girl - some people must have no morals at all.'

Tilly said: 'I was sad when the naughty man took it. It made me cry.'

Leicestershire
Police are appealing for anyone with information about the theft, which
happened in Highcross Street, to come forward.

Friend Jody Branston, 49, heard about the theft and contacted the shop on Tilly’s behalf to ask if it could help.

She said: 'I just thought how can someone do something so horrible to a little girl?

'They nicked a pink teddy bear right off the buggy and they knew exactly what they were doing.

'It’s not like it could have belonged to anyone other than a small child.

'No child should be that upset, so I called the store and asked if staff could do anything and they said ‘yes’ straight away.'

Staff at the shop presented Tilly with a new, identical bear on Thursday.

Supervisor Oliver Ellison remembered serving Tilly and her mum on Tuesday.

He said: 'You could tell she loved it. I was gutted for her when I found out it had been taken. How can someone do that to a little girl?'
