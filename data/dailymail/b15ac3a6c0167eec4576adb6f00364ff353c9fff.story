Male culture: Cressida Dick, Britain's most senior female officer, says women are put off armed units because they do not want to carry 'big guns'

Fewer women  want to be armed police officers because they do not want to carry 'great big guns', Scotland Yard's most senior policewoman has said.

Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick says that there is an overwhelming male 'culture' in armed units despite more women 'flooding in' to other departments.

Women had in the past been forced to adopt 'manly' traits to get ahead, including dressing like men, not using make-up and having to 'swear more', 'drink more' and 'drive faster', she said.

But the senior officer says that has 'completely gone' at the Met, but a macho-culture remains in firearms. 

'I have to say, and it hurts me to say it as an old-school feminist, I do believe in our society and our culture, fewer women who join the police actually want to be armed,' she told a City of London meeting.

'I wouldn’t put it down to genes necessarily – I’d put it down to culture. In my lifetime it will always be more men using police firearms than women.

'We find it easier to have women in some of the areas like personal protection — where you happen to carry a firearm but it's all about other skills, surveillance, you happen to carry a gun in certain departments but it's all about other skills — than we do to get women interested in standing outside the embassy with a great big gun'.

Mrs Dick, who joined the force in 1983, said the Met has changed for the better. 

There are more women but the figure still stands at eight to 10 per cent of the total number of officers, she said.

'A lot of the pioneers had to force themselves to be very manly,' she said according to the Telegraph. 

'They even dressed all like men, they wore grey charcoal suits and nobody would wear a lot of make-up or clothes that were feminine.  

'Some of them took on quite excessive traits, they would swear more, drink more, and drive a heavy car faster. And all that’s just completely gone'.

Scotland Yard is currently being sued by its 'poster girl' firearms officer who claimed her career was held back because of her race and sex. 

Carol Howard, 34, says  she was intimidated by an 'aggressive' inspector who gad once 'scolded' her in front of other senior officers while he was armed with a Taser and a handgun, reducing her to tears. 

Row: Carol Howard, was the poster girl for the Met at London 2012, but is suing the Met for racial and sexual discrimination, right at the tribunal

The elite Diplomatic Protection Group officer, who helped safeguard London from terror attacks during the 2012 Games, claims she was picked on by a supervisor who monitored her Facebook account where she had posted images of herself in a bikini.   

Only authorised armed units are allowed to carry guns. The main British forces usually have one, but larger forces like the Met will have substantially more.Specialist officers at the Ministry of Defence Police, British Transport Police, and Civil Nuclear Constabulary also have permission.

Here are the list of weapons they might carry:

Glock 26 pistol

Walther P99 pistol

SIG Sauer P226 pistol

Heckler & Koch MP5SF

LMT Defender AR-15

Heckler & Koch G3

Remington 870 shotgun

HK417 Marksmen Rifle

Meanwhile in February two ‘petite’ firearms officers were told to expect a pay-out of £70,000 after winning a sex discrimination case over the size of their big guns. 

The weapons were too large for their small hands and as a result they could not reach the trigger, their employment tribunal against the Civil Nuclear Constabulary heard. 

Victoria Wheatley and Rachael Giles also struggled with the grip of the pistols they were using – a Glock 17 – and they also claimed their heads and legs were too small for their protective gear. 

A female marksman was involved in disarming the murderers of Lee Rigby last year.

The officer involved in the Woolwich shooting is one of only a handful of women in Scotland Yard’s elite CO19 unit.

In London, although women fill about one in five police roles, they represent only a tiny proportion of firearms officers.

The markswomen are highly trained and treated as equals in their units – if it falls to them to shoot at a suspect, so be it.

Their skills are prized by police commanders, who desperately want to increase their number.

They believe the presence of female officers at highly charged confrontations can often help defuse violence.

In recent years the Met has held women-only recruitment days for its firearms units and appointed existing female officers  as mentors.Senior officers even considered running training sessions for women with childcare responsibilities – and investing in lighter firearms.In a recent interview, one woman firearms officer said: ‘Men and women have a different viewpoint. Women have a defusing effect, calming things down.’
