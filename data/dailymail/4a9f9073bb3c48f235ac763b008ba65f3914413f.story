U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents shot a Canadian man in the inspection lanes for a bridge linking Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, the agency said Sunday.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) spokesperson Ken Hammond Sr. said in a statement to The Detroit Free Press that two of its agents 'fired their service issued weapons in response to an individual on foot, rapidly approaching the CBP officers, wielding in his hand what appeared to be a black handgun.'

Hammond also said that 'One officer fired three rounds, the other fired one round. One round hit the subject in the arm. Investigators determined that the individual was holding a replica of a handgun.'

The Canadian man exited his vehicle at approximately 3am, went through the inspection lanes and brandished the supposed gun, according to the newspaper.

Citing an earlier U.S. Customs and Border Protection statement, The Detroit Free Press reported that the CBP agents told the Canadian man to let go of the item, but the man refused before he aimed at the agents. Authorities said in the statement cited that the Canadian man was hospitalized and later released into custody.

Multiple agencies were investigating the shooting on the bridge, Hammond's statement to The Detroit Free Press said. Hammond also said that five witnesses spoke with authorities and video was examined.

The newspaper noted the man was involved in an incident with Windsor, Ontario, police officers less than an hour before he was shot by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents. 

In a release posted on Facebook, Windsor police spokesman Sgt. Matthew D'Asti said that officers went to a Windsor McDonald's  after a caller reported at about 2:40am an armed man at the restaurant's parking lot.

'Officers observed the suspect vehicle in the McDonald's parking lot,' D'Asti said. 'As officers arrived, a male exited the vehicle holding a firearm in his hand. The suspect began to walk in the direction of the McDonald's and was ordered at gunpoint to drop his weapon. The suspect then turned in the direction of the officers and pointed the firearm in their direction.'

D'Asti also said that 'The suspect stated to our officers; "Why haven't you shot me yet?" Officers continued to attempt to deescalate the situation using tactical communication.' 

D'Asti said the driver sped off and other law enforcement agencies were contacted.

'Police later learned that the suspect was involved in an incident in the United States with U.S. Customs and Border Protection Officers,' D'Asti said.
