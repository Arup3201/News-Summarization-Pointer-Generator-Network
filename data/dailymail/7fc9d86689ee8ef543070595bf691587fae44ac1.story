A woman stabbed her uncle to death during a family gathering after he confessed to molesting her late sister 12 years earlier.

Bernadette Watt, 29, went berserk and knifed 48-year old Peter Watt in the heart with a kitchen knife after he admitted touching Michelle when she was 16.

Initially Watt tried to claim a friend was behind the attack but confessed to the stabbing in a sudden outburst to police saying: 'He deserved it. He's a paedo. I stabbed him, I stabbed him.'

Knifed to death: Peter Watt, 48, who was murdered by Bernadette, 29, right, after apparently confessing to molesting her sister when she was 16

Today she was found guilty of murder at Manchester Crown Court and was jailed for a minimum term of 22 years.

Mr Watt was stabbed to death when a violent row broke out at his brother Michael's house in Sholver, near Oldham, last November.

Shortly afterwards a 999 call was made
to police and the operator gave instructions to the caller about giving
CPR to the victim.

The call handler could hear a voice in 
the background shouting: 'He's dead, he's dead. I've killed him, I've 
killed him, he's dead.'

Scene: Police start their investigation in Sholver, Oldham, after Peter Watt was stabbed to death last November

Probe: Police were called after a row broke out at the family gathering last November

Officers arrived and found Mr Watt 
lying on the floor, being cradled by his brother. Bernadette Watt was 
sitting on the settee screaming and shouting.

The victim had been stabbed repeatedly 
with a kitchen knife and had bruising to his face neck and body 
indicating a sustained attack.

Killer: Bernadette Watt who was today jailed for a minimum of 22 years after being found guilty of murder

The court heard in the immediate 
aftermath of the killing family friend John Connolly, 39, who was at the
gathering, agreed he would 'take the blame', and Watt was taken to 
Oldham police station as a witness.

When police arrived Connolly said: 'Arrest me I did it.'

Neighbour Doreen Barnes-Roberts said: 'I heard a female voice and I heard something about not phoning the police. The female said that she would get the blame but he said "don't worry I'll take the blame".'

In interview with police Watt said 'it was my mate John who stabbed him' but she later confessed and said her uncle had slept with Michelle who died last year at the age of 28.

While on remand ahead of the murder trial she again admitted the stabbing and said that Connolly was not involved.

Theresa Fletcher, who met Watt while at Styal prison said: 'I was told he was present but he did nothing. If anything he was trying to get her to stop.'

Ms Fletcher claimed she had been told by Bernadette Watt that the victim had admitted to 'touching' her sister Michelle and added: 'Once he actually admitted it she went berserk. I couldn't believe the extremes she went to.'

She said that Bernadette Watt had dismissed Mr Connolly as 'daft' for admitting to the stabbing.

Tests showed Peter sustained three stab wounds in total, two to the chest and one to the heart which first penetrated the left upper arm.

Connolly, of Oldham, stood trial for murder alongside Watt but he was cleared on the directions of the judge after defence lawyers argued there was no case to answer.

Senior Investigator Andrew Tattersall of Greater Manchester Police said today: 'Our thoughts remain with the family of Peter Watt.

'While I hope that Watt being brought to justice provides Peter's family some consolation, there are clearly no winners in this tragic case.

'Only Watt knows why she did what she did, and it is clear that she will have to live with that for the rest of her life.'
