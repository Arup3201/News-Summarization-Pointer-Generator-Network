An England fan sat behind the goal dropped his pants in a desperate attempt to put off the Italians as they stepped forward to take their match-winning penalty during last night's shootout.

The supporter stood with his trousers down and arms crossed in an attempt to catch the eye of Alessandro Diamanti at the crucial moment.

But the former West Ham striker held his nerve and calmly dispatched the penalty - sending England goalkeeper Joe Hart the wrong way.

Cheeky: An England fan drops his trousers as he tries to put Alessandro Diamanti as he takes the final penalty during last night's shootout. Do you know who the England fan is? Email websiteeditorial@dailymail.co.uk

He gave Italy a 4-2 shootout win in the Olympic Stadium, Kiev, sending them through to the semi-finals of Euro 2012.

The cheeky fan, whose identity is not known, was wearing a bright green England goalkeeper's kit and a red and white wig.

The supporter next to him appeared to also be dropping his trousers.

The England team flew home today after their dramatic penalties defeat. But they were given a somewhat low-key homecoming after no England fans turned up at Luton Airport to welcome them back. 

Heartbroken supporters were nowhere to be seen as the players arrived 
back in England in a private jet at around 4.30pm this afternoon.

Six policemen who had been drafted in to deal with crowds were not needed and simply watched the squad arrive at the airport.

But the team seemed in surprisingly 
good spirits despite their loss. The poor welcome home party was in 
marked contrast to the squad’s 
departure to Euro 2012 nearly three weeks ago when fans waved and 
cheered as they left.

Before the tournament, expectations for the England team had been low, 
but after wins in the initial stages fans had started to imagine a win 
may be possible.

About 6,000 England fans jetted out to watch the defeat in Kiev and 
despite initial fears of racism and violence there were no major 
problems.

David Cameron said the players had made 'the country proud' with their performances at the tournament.

The Prime Minister said he watched the game but joked that as it wore on there was a feeling that it would probably end on penalties.

Ashley Young and Ashley Cole missed the crucial spotkicks as England bowed out of the competition. Italy will play Germany in the semi-finals.

Mr Cameron said Roy Hodgson’s men had put on a 'great display' by going through the group stages.

He said: 'I watched the match and I thought England showed a lot of heart, and a lot of spirit and a lot of dogged determination, as you’d expect.

'There were some brilliant individual performances and a real team effort but sadly, as has happened before, you sort of felt as you were watching that it will probably end on penalties and you knew how penalties may probably end.'

Mr Cameron said he was not convinced by Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon’s claim that he prepared for the game by watching movies instead of studying England’s penalty-takers.

'I think he was concentrating a bit harder than that,' he said.

'But I would like to congratulate the team and the manager and all who worked so hard with them and for them to put on a great display.

'They made the country proud to go through the group stage in the way that they did.'

England captain Steven Gerrard last night vowed to lead the country to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil after the penalty shootout heartbreak.

'We have given a good account of ourselves,' he said.

'We haven't blown people away but we stuck together, fought hard and gave every inch of effort.

'However, at times we have found it difficult to keep the ball. The possession stats speak for themselves.

'It tells you that moving forward as a nation, we do need to try and improve with the ball.'

The shootout last night was watched by more than 23 million people - the highest peak TV audience for eight years.

Overnight viewing figures showed the BBC1 coverage of the Euro 2012 quarter-final hit its height at 10.20pm with 23.2 million watching the deciding shoot-out.

An average audience of 17.4 million watched the coverage, with its extra-time and penalty climax - the highest audience of the tournament so far.

The match, which saw England packed off home, drew three-quarters of all TV viewers during England’s penalty agony.

It is the highest peak on any UK channel for eight years, since Euro 2004’s England v Portugal match - a game which similarly saw hopes dashed on penalties.

England’s previous match in Euro 2012 - a 1-0 victory over Ukraine last week - drew a 16.1 million average audience.
