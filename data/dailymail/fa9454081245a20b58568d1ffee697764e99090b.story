Each victim of the Sandy Hook massacre now has a memorial playground that honors their life in a joyful way.

The last of 26 playgrounds dedicated to the victims of the 2012 shooting opened Sunday at Veterans Memorial Park to a playful but respectful crowd of children and their parents.

This final park was dedicated to Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung, the principal at Sandy Hook, who came out of her office after she heard shots in the school and confronted Adam Lanza.

Rebuilding: For the project, Where Angels Play built 26 playgrounds in towns affected by Hurricane Sandy that were dedicated to the memories of the 26 victims of Sandy Hook

But on Sunday, NBC reports, attention was focused on the happier memories that friends and family had of Hochsprung as they dedicated the playground in her memory.

'For 27 years of my life, my mom wasn't just my mom. She was my best friend. She was my mentor. She was my hero,' said Erica Smegielski.

The family helped plan the park, which broke ground in a smaller ceremony last Tuesday.

Hochsprung's grandchildren 'said from day one, "We want pirates and we want poodles,"' said Smegielski. 

The family also planned the design of the park, which was done in yellow and purple, Hochsprung's favorite colors.  

Making this all happen was a firefighter from  New Jersey who had felt 'demoralized and crushed and depressed' after hearing of the shooting at Sandy Hook, reports the Los Angeles Times.

Community: Volunteers rallied together to build each playground on donated equipment and with funds raised through Where Angels Play and by New Jersey firemen

Dedication: Hochsprung's family honored her memory at the opening of the playground built with the input of her children and grandchildren

Heroes: Retired firefighter Bill Lavin says that the 'heroes of this project are the moms and dads and wives and husbands of Sandy Hook' who helped others after their own tragedy

'The response from the families validated that I needed to do this,' said Bill Lavin, who worked for the Elizabeth fire department.

The inspiration was work that the New Jersey Fireman's Benevolent Association in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. 

Then, members of the association had traveled down to hard-hit Mississippi in order to build playgrounds in communities devastated by the storm.

Now, with the help of retired firefighters and other volunteers, Lavin has accomplished the 'crazy' feat of building 26 playgrounds in northeastern towns affected by Hurricane Sandy.

'The heroes of this project are the moms and dads and wives and husbands of Sandy Hook who, while suffering maybe the worst tragedy imaginable, had the courage, strength and generosity of spirit to give to others,' Lavin said.

Lavin's non-profit, Where Angels Play, says it now plans to build on the idea in other cities. Rebecca Kowalski, the mother of one of the children killed at Sandy Hook, six-year-old Chase, says she hopes to reach other grieving families.

'It kind of makes your heart grow a little bit bigger with each one ,' says Kowalski.
