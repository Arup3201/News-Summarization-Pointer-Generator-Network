ISIS has executed another nine men for allegedly being spies in an unknown location in the Middle East.

Each man is forced to give interview before their murder in which they admit to spying on the terror group's location, movement and armament.

All nine of them - blindfolded with hands bound behind their backs - are then escorted outside by masked terrorists who eventually instruct them to kneel and place handguns to their heads.

They pull the triggers without hesitation, sending their victims jerking forward until their limp bodies hit the dusty ground.

The masked ISIS commander who introduces the latest senseless propaganda video says the men 'were sentenced to death for betraying the religion of Allah'.

 Senseless: ISIS has released footage of nine men being executed for allegedly spying on the terrorists

Murder: The blindfolded and shackled men were led onto a bridge in an unknown location in the Middle East before being shot by masked extremists

Forced confessions? Before their deaths, each man claims responsibility for spying on ISIS, although it is unknown whether they are speaking under duress 

Doomed: The men are eventually escorted out of the building - clad with Islamic State insignia - to their deaths

Graphic footage ultimately shows the deceased captives resting perfectly still in a shallow pool of blood.

But the scenes in which the senseless murders take place come six minutes and 30 seconds after the start of the seven minute video.

It begins with a bizarre setup of a masked ISIS commander sitting in a corporate office, flanked by two other soldiers.

He say that Islamic State succeeded in arresting an entire 'cell' of spies who were tasked with monitoring their locations back to their commanding officer.

The unnamed militant then claims three of the men who squealed on the others, adding: 'We took the investigation to a judge and after collecting evidence, they were sentenced to death for betraying the religion of Allah.' 

Each of the nine kidnapped men are then forced to give interviews before their impending doom - presumably under duress - in which they confess to being spies.

Their nationalities and professions are as yet a mystery, but some of the men look visibly terrified as they speak in trembling Arabic. 

This is the second video of an Islamic State execution to surface this week following the equally brutal mass murder of eight 'informers'. 

Mastermind: The second gruesome execution video to surface this week begins with a masked fighter who says the men were 'sentenced to death for betraying the religion of Allah'

Captured: The unnamed ISIS commander also claims that three of the alleged spies squealed on their comrades 

Execution: After being escorted onto what appears to be a bridge by armed fighters, the blindfolded men are instructed to kneal

Terror: The gruesome video is the second to surface this week following the footage of eight other alleged spies being killed in a similar way on Thursday

In the video which emerged on Thursday, the terror group justified the killings as vengeance for the military operations against them in Syria and Iraq.

The gruesome propaganda video cut from scenes of the men being killed to footage of people who ISIS claims were killed during Coalition attacks on its locations.

Cutaways include footage of dead children underneath the rubble of destroyed buildings and body bags.

As with the latest video which features interviews with the doomed captives, it featured graphics which 'profiled' each of the men about to be murdered.

The videos emerge amid claims that ISIS is using chlorine gas as a chemical weapon against peshmerga fighters in Iraq.

Kurdish authorties made the allegation following a suicide bomb attack involving a truck on January 23. 

Murdered: Militants claim the eight men were informers, engaged in military operations against ISIS

Revenge: The militants have justified the killings as retaliation for air strikes against land they hold

In a statement, the Kurdistan Region Security Council said the alleged chemical attack took place on a road between Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul and the Syrian border.

It was there Peshmerga forces who were trying to seize a ISIS supply line - and discovered '20 gas canisters' loaded onto the back of the truck involved.

Video provided by the council showed the truck racing down a road with white smoke pouring out of it as it came under heavy fire from peshmerga fighters. 

It later showed a white, billowing cloud after the truck exploded and the remnants of it scattered across a road.
