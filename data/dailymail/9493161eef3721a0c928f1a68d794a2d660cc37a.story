A Romanian family of 17 is collecting more than £55,000  a year in state benefits – nearly three times as much as the father earns.

Mihal Toma and his wife would require a pre-tax income of around £125,000 a year to maintain the same standard of living for their brood.

His wages of £1,800 a month as an electrician and the fact that they have 15 children mean they qualify for a raft of benefits which they say total £55,200.

Place to live: Parents Mihai and Veronica Toma (pictured standing with youngest child Elizabeth) reportedly 'lied' to get a three bedroom house in Harrow, north-west London. Pictured from the left, back row, are: Andreia, 17, Ionut, 16, Daniela, 19. Middle row: Cristina, 11, Beniamin, four, Ana Maria, 15, Filip Elisei, two, Miriam, eight, and Iona, 13.

They receive £2,500 a month in working tax credit, £1,400 in housing benefit for the three-bedroom rented home they cram their family into, and £700 in child benefit, which totals £4,600 a month.

When Mr Toma’s £21,600 wage is added to the benefits, the family have a monthly income of £6,400 – or £76,800 a year.

The Government’s £26,000 a year benefits cap does not apply as Mr Toma is in work and entitled to the tax credits.

The farcical situation was revealed after the family admitted they were so desperate for a new life that they lied to their private landlord about the size of their family to secure their home in Stanmore, North West London.

Packed: Housing inspectors were informed of the Tomas' living situation, and after visiting the property described it as one of the worst cases of overcrowding they had ever seen, but added the family had intentionally over-filled their home

Daughter Daniela, 19, speaking on behalf of Mr Toma, 47, and his wife Veronica, 37, told the Mail: ‘If we have the benefits it’s because it is our right in this country. We like it here, it’s a nice place.’

She insisted they pay their £1,700-a-month rent and council tax and ‘spend the [benefits] money in this country for the food and everything the children need and keep the bills paid up to date’, adding that this includes repayments on a VW people carrier parked outside.

But the huge cost of supporting the family has led to renewed calls for a benefits overhaul.

Bob Blackman, Tory MP for Harrow East, said: ‘If people choose to come here with their families and work that’s fine, but from their income they then have to generate the income to support their families, not expect the taxpayers of this country to subsidise their family.

‘The vast majority of people would say the public purse is supporting the family to a huge extent, far more than he is paid and far more than he pays in taxation. How is that reasonable?’

Mr Blackman raised the issue of the family’s overcrowded house with the council after being alerted by neighbours while campaigning during the local elections.

He said there was a concern about the children’s welfare because of the cramped conditions.

Campaigners say the UK’s generous system of in-work benefits, such as tax credits, are a massive lure for those from overseas.

A migrant earning the minimum wage with a partner and two children can boost their net income threefold with tax credits and housing benefit.

Mr Toma was at work yesterday and several of the younger children were at school.

But Mrs Toma agreed to let her daughter Daniela, who speaks good English, speak to the Mail on behalf of the family.

Eight of the 17 children are in local state schools, and Daniela is studying business at college.

She said the family originally lived in Prahova, southern Romania, but moved to Spain seven years ago after Mr Toma got a job there.

After the economic crisis, they came to Britain in 2012 so he could find new work and moved to their current home in September 2013.

Council environmental health officers have told the family they must move but they will not be able to jump the queue for a council house.

They are not eligible to be placed on the housing register as they have not been resident in the borough of Harrow for five years.
