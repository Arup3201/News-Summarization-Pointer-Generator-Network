A Colombian drugs lord let a cocaine mule with a kilogram of contraband in his stomach die - before cutting out the packet and selling it on, police say.

The body of a well-connected young lawyer was discovered in a forest near Malaga, Spain, in August 2010.

The man was found without clothing, wrapped in clingfilm and with a cut in his abdomen.

A handout photo from Guardia Civil shows what appears to be an X-ray of the mule with packages still in his stomach. He had ingested almost a kilogram of drugs in numerous packages, officers say

Now, four years later, the Spanish Civil Guard have announced they discovered what happened to the man - known in reports as J.A.U.I.

The man, a Colombian national with Spanish citizenship, was hired by a drug lord - known as J.A.V.H in records - to bring a packet of cocaine from South America to Spain.

J.A.U.I made it from Colombia to Chile and eventually to Spain - but by the time he landed, he was suffering from terrible pains in his stomach, officers said.

It is thought the pain was caused by several bags of cocaine - thought to weigh up to a kilogram - in his intestines.

Clearly not too interested in his mule's welfare, J.AV.H. just waited for him to die, The Local reports.

An autopsy showed that J.A.U.I was given painkillers as he was dying, however.

After the man died, the drug lord cut out his contraband - removing it through his stomach.It is thought J.A.V.H then sold on the drugs.

A later forensic examination concluded the lawyer died from intestinal obstruction.

It added a package was removed via a cut in the man's stomach  - which was later stitched up with fishing line.

Spanish police have now arrested the drug lord - who is now awaiting punishment. It is thought he had several identities, addresses and security personnel.
