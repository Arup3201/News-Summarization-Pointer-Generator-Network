The Queen's decision to stay elsewhere on her Balmoral estate to let tourists wander her castle home has paid off.

Visitor numbers have increased five per cent this summer - edging past 70,000, the best for five years and nearly a record for the Royal retreat.

Some 40 per cent of the tourists came from overseas, underlining the foreign attraction of the British Monarchy.

Tourist boom: Balmoral Castle has seen visitors reach a five-year high

Because of a timetable clash this year, the Monarch was in Scotland earlier than usual for the Commonwealth Games, meaning tourists were still wandering around her summer residence before it closed at the end of July.

So, following her visit to the Glasgow Games, the Queen moved into the seven-bedroom Craigowan Lodge on the 50,000 acre estate instead, which is about a mile away from the castle.

The arrangements were made so the estate could stay open to the public for its normal seasonal period of April to July.

The 88-year-old monarch's move to Craigowan was prompted by the growing need to maximise tourist revenue to make the estate pay for itself.

Running costs: The increase in visitor numbers to Balmoral means half the £3m costs will be met 

It costs around £3m-a-year to run Balmoral - which is owned privately by the Queen - and tourist revenue meets about half the bills.

But her decision to let the castle remain open as normal has helped ring the cash tils louder at Balmoral. Adults pay £11 - and children £5 - to visit part of the castle and its grounds.

Gary Marsden, the estate's visitor enterprise manager, said it had been 'a very good year'.

'We are about five per cent up on last year and we are very pleased,' he said. 'They are the best figures for five years and a near record.

'We had a good number of overseas visitors too. About 40 per cent of our visitors come from abroad - with Germany the biggest market. As well as numbers being up, so was the visitor spend too.'

The Queen's decision to stay at Craigowan means that the estate has been able to generate as full a revenue as possible from tourism at the close of its season. The success has also helped the it freeze next year's admission prices.

Craigowan Lodge has been well-used by the Royal Family in the past. Prince Charles stayed there with Diana after their 1981 wedding, as did Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson after their marriage.

The estate has also tried to maximise income from activities such as running holidays, cottage rentals, fishing, wildlife safari trips, weddings and corporate hospitality events.

Balmoral's golf club, used by the Royal Family, was hired out for 11 corporate days - bagging more than £25,000 for the Monarch - with even clubhouse barbecues arranged for sunny days.

Balmoral was beloved by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and has remained a favourite with the Queen and her family.

The castle is located on a working estate which aims to protect the environment while contributing to the local economy.

Earlier this year MPs heard that the Queen was to be down to her last £1million and her palaces are 'crumbling'.

The Public Accounts Committee criticised the Household for failing to make more savings and also said it should be making more money.

Balmoral is privately owned by the Queen and who meets its costs personally.

Meanwhile Christmas is to come more than two months early at the Queen's Scottish retreat this week.

Balmoral has decided to hold its Christmas sale on Tuesday - because an historic Deeside Bridge that is near it will be closed for several months over the winter to allow work to strengthen and improve it.

The Balmoral Bridge, close to the Queen's home, will close on Wednesday (October 8) and is scheduled to reopen at the start of February 2015.

The £450,000 work is essential to its long term future.

Designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Balmoral Bridge was constructed in 1857 for Prince Albert.

It is a category-A listed heritage structure which carries the B976 South Deeside Road over the River Dee near to Balmoral Castle.

But the current bridge decking has been subject to the elements for 35 years. The bridge will also be repainted to protect it.

The next available vehicular crossing over the Dee is at Ballater, meaning a total diversion of around 14 miles for those living on and around the Balmoral Estate.

So Balmoral has decided to hold its annual festive sale on Tuesday (October 7), the day before the bridge closes.

Gates will be open between 3pm until 7pm.
