Almost £2billion of British taxpayers' money is to be used to pay for climate change projects overseas including wind turbines in Africa and greener cattle farming in Colombia, a Lib Dem minister has claimed.

Last night senior Conservatives condemned the size of the bill - equivalent to £70 for every household - with former chancellor Lord Lawson of Blaby attacking the 'appalling waste of money'. But Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, hailed the cash as 'fantastic news'.

Today the row threatened to overshadow a 
separate move by George Osborne to cut hundreds of millions of pounds 
from planned increases in Britain’s foreign aid budget following 
complaints from Conservative MPs that it is too lavish.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey announced each household will contribute an average of £70 towards schemes to tackle climate change in the third world before March 2015

The Chancellor is able to scale back 
the budget and still meet the Government’s controversial target to 
increase aid to 0.7 per cent of GDP by 2014, Whitehall sources told the 
Daily Mail.

The move is 
designed to cheer Conservatives opposed to David Cameron's pledge to 
increase foreign aid budgets at a time when the rest of Whitehall is 
tightening its belt.

But
instead Tories are dismayed at the timing of the Lib Dem announcement 
to commit up to £2billion to helping third world countries deal with 
climate change.

The money is coming from the existing budget of Department for Energy and Climate Change.

Mr Davey made the announcement as he arrived at United Nations climate change talks in Doha, Qatar, making Britain the first G7 country to make such a pledge.

But the row threatened to overshadow a separate move by George Osborne to cut hundreds of millions of pounds from planned increases in Britain’s foreign aid budget following complaints from Conservative MPs that it is too lavish.

At a party at the British Embassy, ministers gave details of £150 million in new projects as part of Britain's £1.8billion in 'climate aid' for poorer countries within three years.

Mr Davey said the money should be spent because 'climate change is a global threat and with every passing year, the nature and the extent of that threat grows clearer'.

'We also recognise that the world's poorest will be hit the hardest by the impacts of climate change, and we need to help communities adapt to these challenges,' he said.

The UK's package of support includes almost £100million to help to subsidise renewable energy in Africa, such as electricity produced from wind and solar farms.

Jacob Rees-Mogg, Conservative MP for North East Somerset, said the spending was 'an absolutely classic example of waste'

Around £15million will go to help cattle farmers practise 'low carbon agriculture' in Colombia and £14million will help build wind farms and other renewables in Uganda.

Jacob Rees-Mogg, Conservative MP for North East Somerset, said the spending was 'an absolutely classic example of waste' that should be stopped at a time of austerity.

'All I can say is a fool and his money are soon parted,' he said.

'But it's the British taxpayer having to pay for this absurd expenditure. We know wind farms are all but useless and nobody wants them in England, let alone Africa.'

Glyn Davies, a Conservative MP for Montgomeryshire, also criticised the level of climate aid spending.

'This can't be the priority for spending when the Coalition government is trying to create jobs and reduce the cost of living,' he said.

'It seems difficult to understand how we can justify this when energy is a huge cost for so many of our households and businesses.'

Peter Bone, Conservative MP for Wellingborough, said he thought the spending was 'absolutely crazy' at a time when public services were being cut.

But Tracy Carty, a climate change adviser for Oxfam, said: 'At last, a developed country has finally made a pledge for future climate finance here in Doha. The UK has taken a step forward.'

The international aid budget has been protected from cuts, after all three parties agreed to increase aid to 0.7 per cent of GDP by 2014.

Ironically, the target can now be hit with less money because of lower than expected economic growth.

The Coalition’s decision to increase aid spending by to more than £12 billion at a time of austerity at home has divided opinion, with significant numbers of Tory backbenchers arguing the budget is riddled with corruption and waste.

Mr Cameron has argued that leading the world boosts Britain’s standing on the world stage, as well as limiting immigration and terror threats that might otherwise emerge from developing nations.

However, the new International Development Secretary Justine Greening, a former accountant, has adopted a more sceptical approach than her predecessor Andrew Mitchell.

Last month, in what was seen as the beginning of the end of Britain sending billions of pounds in foreign aid to better-off countries, she announced that a controversial £280 million-a-year aid programme to India is to be brought to an end.

Tory MPs had pointed out that India’s economy is growing at the rate of eight per cent a year, meaning it is now able to spend vast sums on defence and has its own space programme. India now even has its own overseas aid programme, worth £328 million a year.

But under Labour, India became the biggest net recipient of British aid, receiving £421 million in 2010. Despite India’s rapid economic development, Mr Mitchell decided to approve a further £1.1 billion in aid over the following four years.

Last week, Miss Greening also suspended a £21 million aid payment to Rwanda following warnings that its Government was arming a rebellion in the Congo.

Sources said Mr Osborne remained committed to hitting the target to increase foreign aid to 0.7 per cent of GDP by 2014.

But slower than expected economic growth means the big planned increases in the aid budget are now due to ‘overshoot’ the target - a situation which the Chancellor believes cannot be justified at a time of cutbacks at home.

Over the next two years, the aid budget is expected to be reined in by almost £1 billion as a result.
