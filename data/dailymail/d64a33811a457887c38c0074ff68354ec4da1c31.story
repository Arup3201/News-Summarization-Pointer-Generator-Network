An entire family of seven - including four young children - was swept away and drowned by flood waters after leaving the safety home to hide in a drainage ditch during the tornado that howled through Oklahoma on Friday night.

Authorities in believe 16 people died as a result of the storm. Three veteran storm chasers were killed by the twister that touched down in the Oklahoma City suburb of El Reno. The rest died in the ensuring flash floods that swept the region.

Family members say Samuel Cifuentes led his wife and son, as well as his wife's cousin and her three young children, into a concrete drainage ditch just feet from his house because he believed it would provide more shelter from the tornado. They carried a table out from the home and were huddled under it when a rush of water swept all seven away.

The house, which is within sight of the drainage ditch, was untouched by the storm, which touched down more than 25 miles away.

Tragic: Yolanda Santos and her children Lesly, Cristofer and Brandon were all killed in the flooding. Rescuers are still searching for the bodies of Yolanda and Lesly

Unexpected: Mr Cifuentes believed that his family would be safe hiding under a table in this concrete drainage ditch. He never thought that the rains would cause a flash flood

Rescuers are still searching for the bodies of two members of the family. Firefighters say the creeks and rivers are still too swollen to send divers underwater. All seven members are believed killed, KWTV reports.

'They were in the ditch because they thought it was the safest spot because they just thought it was going to be a tornado, not a flooding. They didn't imagine that,' Enma Aguilar, a family member, told the news station.

Family members say that the bodies of Samuel Cifuentes and his young son Alex were found on Sunday. The body of his wife Florinda Santos was discovered on Saturday, four miles downstream from the drainage ditch.

Santos' cousin, Yolanda Santos, as well as her eight-year-old daughter Lesly are still missing. Yolanda's two sons, Cristofer and Brandon have been found dead.

Mr Cifuentes' brother Biron told KWTV that his family is in shock over his brother's decision to leave home. All seven people drowned within sight of the house.

'It doesn't matter if they are found dead or alive, I just want them to be found,' Biron Cifuentes said.

Deadly: The tornado that touched down near El Reno, Oklahoma, killed three storm chasers. However, it was nowhere near Mr Cifuentes' house in Oklahoma City

Downpour: Of the 16 people killed in Oklahoma City by the storm, 13 died as a result of flooding. Three more died from flooding in Arkansas

Searching: Rescuers are still looking for the bodies of at least five people who were swept away by floodwaters

A second family was washed away and believed drowned in a similar incident. Ten people hid out in a storm train in another part of Oklahoma City when the tornado approached. A man and three young children were swept away and have not been found. Six of the people managed to escape the rapid waters.

Additionally, a man in Oklahoma County died Saturday morning when his vehicle was swept away by flood waters. A grandmother in Okfuskee County also drowned in her car when it was overtaken by high water.

The tornado ultimately touched down 25 miles outside of Oklahoma City, near the suburb of El Reno. It was responsible for the deaths of Tim Samaras, 55, his son Paul Samaras, 24, and crew member Carl Young, 45 - all professional storm chasers who were caught up in the violent twister.

Oklahomans are still badly shaken from the massive EF5 twister that tore through the town of Moore, Oklahoma, on Mary 20 killing 24 people and injuring hundreds. Many of the people who were killed had taken shelter in homes, schools and businesses that were reduced to splinters by winds that reached 210mph.

Friday night's storm formed out on the prairie west of Oklahoma City, giving residents plenty of advance notice.

When told to seek shelter, many ventured out and snarled traffic across the metro area - perhaps remembering the damage from May 20.

'It was chaos. People were going southbound in the northbound lanes. Everybody was running for their lives,' said Terri Black, 51, a teacher's assistant in Moore.

After seeing last month's tornado also turn homes into piles of splintered rubble, Black said she decided to try and outrun the tornado when she learned her southwest Oklahoma City home was in harm's way. She quickly regretted it.

The death of the storm chasers in pursuit of the storm are believed to be the first among scientific researchers while chasing tornadoes, the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, said.

'They put themselves in harm's way so that they can educate the public about the destructive power of these storms,' said Chris West, the undersheriff in Canadian County, where the men died.

The elder Samaras, of Bennett, Colorado, had a reputation for being safe, but was trapped on the highway with his son and Young, who taught geology at Lake Tahoe Community College in South Lake Tahoe, California.

'I don't know if I would say I worried about it because one of the biggest things he stressed was safety,' said Tim's brother, Jim Samaras, who confirmed the deaths to The Associated Press.

'He knew what to look for. He knew where not to be and in this case, the tornado took a clear turn toward them.'

Tim Samaras and his Twistex tornado chase team produced material for the Discovery Channel, National Geographic and meteorological conferences.

'He looked at tornadoes not for the spotlight of TV but for the scientific aspect,' Jim Samaras said. 'At the end of the day, he wanted to save lives and he gave the ultimate sacrifice for that.'

The Oklahoma storm that killed the three chasers developed right in front to them. Tim Samaras tweeted a photo of clouds rising through a volatile atmosphere and noted: 'Storms now initiating south of Watonga along triple point. Dangerous day ahead for OK â€” stay weather savvy!'

It was his last tweet.
