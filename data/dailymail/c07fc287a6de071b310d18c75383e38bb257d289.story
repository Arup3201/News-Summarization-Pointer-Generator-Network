The RAF's new £650milion fleet of second-hand spy planes will fly in U.S. colours because defence bosses say it is not cost effective to repaint them.

Instead of the air force's uniform light grey, the three RC-135 Rivet Joint aircraft, which were bought from the U.S., will keep their design of a white top, black nose and grey underside.

The Ministry of Defence said it would cost £3million to repaint them.

Paint job: The RAF's three RC-135 Rivet Joint aircraft will retain the U.S. air force's colours of a white top, black nose and grey underside but the air force's roundels will be painted on

Repainting the aircraft would cost £3million to pay for trials to ensure the paint did not interfere with computer surveillance technology

Only the RAFs blue, red and white roundels will be added to the wings and fuselage of the aircraft.

The MoD said repainting the craft would involve a series of expensive trials to check the paint did not cause problems with the planes' computer surveillance equipment.

It is a further embarrassment for the ministry after it emerged that the RAF cannot refuel the planes in mid-air.

Britain must rely on NATO nations and the U.S. to fill up the aircraft once they are in the skies.

Critics are concerned about the reliance on Britain's allies.

Mark Ayton, the editor of AIR International magazine, told The Sunday Times said: 'Anything the Ministry of Defence does to jeopardise sovereignty has got to be questioned.'

Ministers bought three second-hand Rivet Joints from the U.S. Air Force in March 2010 to eavesdrop on enemy communications.

The three planes replace the Nimrod fleet (pictured) after one crashed in Afghanistan, killing 14 servicemen

Renamed the Airseeker by the RAF, the vintage jets are being introduced to replace the Nimrod surveillance planes axed in 2011 after one blew up over Afghanistan, killing all 14 men on board.

The aircraft are due to enter service next year but refuelling must be done on the ground, which will make it impossible to carry out airborne missions of more than 12 hours without begging help from allies.

The problem is that the U.S. Air Force and other Nato countries use a different method of air-to-air refuelling than the RAF.

The U.S. uses a boom refuelling system so a tanker aircraft would fly ahead of the Rivet Joint and pass back a rigid, hollow pipe which fits into its tank so fuel can be pumped into it - similar to how a car would be filled up at a petrol station.

A MoD spokeswoman said: 'The MoD decided to configure our Rivet Joint aircraft to as close a common standard with the USAF as is possible, this has significant support cost benefits through life of the aircraft.

'When 51 Squadron personnel begin operating UK Rivet Joint aircraft they will wear RAF flying suits.'
