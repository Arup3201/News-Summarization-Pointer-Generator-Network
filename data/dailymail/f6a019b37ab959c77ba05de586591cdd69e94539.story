Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella believes Lionel Messi's habit of throwing up during games is because of nerves.

The Barcelona star has vomited on the pitch during several games over the last few seasons and appeared to once again during Argentina's last warm-up match against Slovenia on Saturday.

'I reckon in these moments there is anxiety more than anything,' said Sabella before his team made their way to Brazil. 'It's difficult to remain calm.'

Nervous? Lionel Messi's habit of being sick during games is down to nerves according to his coach`

Back in March Messi endured an uncomfortable evening in Bucharest as Argentina were held to a goalless draw by Romania - as the superstar was physically sick on the pitch.

The Barcelona forward was unable to unlock a stubborn Romania defence on a frustrating night - and his exertions in trying to break through appeared to take its toll, as Messi fell ill during the first half.

After the game Messi played down his on-pitch illness: 'My vomiting has always happened,' he said. 'It happened a few times with BarÃ§a. It's nothing to me.

Argentina face Bosnia, Iran and Nigeria in Group G and it will be interesting to see just how Messi deals with his nerves on the biggest stage of all.
