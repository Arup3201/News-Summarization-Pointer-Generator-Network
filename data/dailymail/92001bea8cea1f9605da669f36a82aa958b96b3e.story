The men recalled how killer Joanna Dennehy attacked them at random in two separate incidents last year

Two men who were targeted at random by serial killer Joanna Dennehy have described how the woman 'showed no emotion' as she brutally stabbed them and left them for dead.

Robin Bereza and John Rogers, who were attacked separately, recalled how the killer warned: 'I'm hurting you, I'm going to f****** kill you' before repeatedly stabbing them in the chest.

The 31-year-old murderer, who is awaiting sentencing for the attacks in addition to the murders of three other men, 'seemed like she was going about business' during the incidents in Hereford in April.

Dennehy pleaded guilty to killing Kevin Lee, Lukasz Slaboszewski and John Chapman in November.

Gary Stretch and Leslie Layton are accused of assisting the woman who 'cast a spell' over victims, one of whom she had been having an affair with.

After killing the men, Dennehy is thought to have driven 140 miles to Hereford where she attacked Mr Bereza and Mr Rogers in broad daylight. 

Cambridge Crown Court heard how the woman 
from Orton Goldhay, Peterborough, told one of her alleged accomplices: 
'I want my fun' before selecting the men at random.

Giving evidence at the trial of Stretch and Layton today, the former said: 'I saw the lady with that thing in her hands. I didn’t know what it was.

'I got worried then, frightened. I said: ‘What are you doing?

'She said ‘I’m hurting you, I’m going to f****** kill you’.'

The retired fireman continued: 'I felt a blow to my right shoulder. I turned around and saw this lady, she just stared straight through me.

'I kicked her and made contact. It had no impact on her. She just came straight towards me.

'I ran into the road. I put my hand to my jacket and saw all this blood.

'She tried to come for me again, I kicked her again; she still didn’t react.'

Mr Bereza was treated by paramedics at the scene before being airlifted to hospital. He recalled seeing his attacker speeding off in a car driven by a 'big gentleman'.

Dennehy went on to attack Mr Rogers as he walked on along a cycle path.

He described feeling a sudden 'punch' to his back, before turning to face the woman who then stabbed him in the chest.  

'I turned around and saw the woman who stabbed me just standing there,' he told the court.

Mr Rogers recalled how the she commented on the fact he was bleeding, and said: 'I better do some more' before plunging her knife into his chest again.

'She didn't seem to be showing any emotion. She didn't seem to be enjoying herself.

'She just seemed like she was going about business,' he added.

'As I lay there I thought "this is where I'm going to die"'.

Mr Rogers was taken to hospital by air ambulance where he received life-saving surgery.

Stretch, real name Gary Richards, 47, of Orton Goldhay, Peterborough, has denied three charges of preventing the lawful burial of all three men and two counts of attempted murder.

Layton, 36, also of Orton Goldhay, has denied perverting the course of justice and two counts of preventing the lawful burial of the bodies of Mr Chapman and Mr Lee.

A third man, Robert Moore, 55, of Peterborough, has admitted assisting an offender and is also awaiting sentence.

The trial continues.

Dennehy pleaded guilty to three murder charges and two counts of attempted murder in November.

She is in custody, awaiting sentencing.
