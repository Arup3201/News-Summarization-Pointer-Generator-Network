Images from the horrific Costa Concordia disaster sent shock waves around the world, overnight delivering a devastating blow to the cruise line industry.

But the owners of that doomed vessel hope the delivery of a new massive flagship will revive its fortunes.

Operator Costa Crociere - owned by the Carnival Cruise Lines - launched Concordia's sister ship, the 114,500-tonne Costa Fascinosa.

Massive: The 114,500-tonne Costa Fascinosa, built by state-owned shipyard Fincantieri, has space for 3,500 passengers

Luxury: Costa Fascinosa, which will make its inaugural cruise on May 11, is a floating city with a shopping centre, five restaurants, 13 bars, casino rooms and more

Built by state-owned shipyard 
Fincantieri, it has space for 3,500 passengers. An even bigger vessel, with
5,000 berths, should be ready in 2014 for a company that says bookings 
have recovered from the crisis.

‘We
can't ignore the January accident. It hit us hard. We are working on 
safety issues,’ Costa CEO and Chairman Pier Luigi Foschi told reporters 
in a spacious bar onboard the Fascinosa with a view over Venice's 
lagoon.               

In 
January, the Costa Concordia hit a reef near the island of Giglio off 
the Tuscan coast, capsizing and killing at least 30 people in an 
accident investigators say was caused when its captain Francesco 
Schettino took the ship too close to shore.   

The
accident rocked the cruise liner industry, hitting bookings and raising
concerns about the safety of the huge modern cruise ships that ply the 
seas with thousands of passengers aboard.

For
Costa Crociere, which last year carried 2.3 million passengers, it 
could hardly have come at a worse time, with the global economic crisis 
already making potential cruise customers nervous about their jobs and 
finances.

The company actually stopped marketing for a period but now says customers are flowing back.        

‘Despite
the economic downturn and the impact on consumption Costa has bounced 
back and booking volumes are back to the same levels recorded this time 
last year,’ Foschi said.         

Costa
has promised to introduce a real-time route-monitoring system, which 
will be later adopted by parent group Carnival Corporation & Plc, 
and a system to increase sharing of the ship's navigation plan between 
the captain and the officers.   

‘We
do not want to radically change the responsibilities of the captain but
simply allow other officers to give opinions,’ Foschi said.          

Some
of the Concordia officers have said they raised the alarm day but that 
Schettino dismissed the scale of the danger.

Wreck: The devastating Costa Concordia cruise ship disaster resulted in at least 30 deaths when the ship ran aground off the west coast of Italy, at Giglio island on January 14

The
Costa Fascinosa, which will make its inaugural cruise on May 11, is a 
floating city with a shopping centre, five restaurants, 13 bars, casino 
rooms and more.  

Carnival brushed off concerns that liners have grown too big, saying it is giving customers what they want.      

Carnival's
Chief Operating Officer Howard Frank said: ‘It's true some people go 
for smaller ships for premium and luxury cruises but the bigger liners 
create additional amenities and they are the preference. They're here to
stay for quite some time.’      

Protesters
in Venice, where the Fascinosa was built, have called for large vessels
to be banned from sailing in the Lagoon waters in front of St. Mark's 
square because of the environmental damage they cause.               

There
are also concerns of damage to tourism in Giglio where the Concordia 
will lie for some time. The company says the ship can be towed away in 
nine months.           

Carnival
says the cruise industry is something of a lifeline for Italy's 
flagging labour market, not just for the tourists it brings but for the 
shipbuilding industry too.   

‘In
the last 23-24 years Carnival has invested some $24 billion in building
ships in Italy, I think that's the largest investment made in the 
country by any one company,’ Frank said.      

Carnival has five new ships being built by Fincantieri.
