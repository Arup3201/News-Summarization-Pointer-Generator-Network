Arsenal will look to solve the problem of their poor form by signing Porto's attacking duo Jackson Martinez and Juan Quintero, according to reports in Portugal.

Portuguese newspaper A Bola claim the Gunners are willing to spend up to €75million (£60) on the Colombian pair.

The story was also reported in another Iberian paper, Record. The move would certainly come as a surprise to Arsenal fans, most of whom are clamouring for defensive, not offensive, reinforcements.

The Spanish press, meanwhile, have chosen to largely ignore their nation's 1-0 defeat at the hands of world champions Germany, and focus instead of some comments from Lionel Messi.

Both Mundo Deportivo and Sport report that the Argentine forward may not, as previously thought, remain at Barcelona for the duration of his career.

According to the papers, Messi said: 'I'd stay for ever but sometimes you don't always get what you want.' 

It is the first time the three-time Ballon d'Or winner has even hinted at the possibility of leaving Spain.

Italy may have won five of their six games since the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, but that doesn't mean Azzurri boss Antonio Conte doesn't have any worries.

As with Brendan Rodgers, Conte is concerned with Mario Balotelli's underwhelming form, but the former Juventus boss says he doesn't have time to address the issue.

La Gazzetta dello Sport reports the Conte claimed Italian football doesn't teach hard work, he doesn't have time for Balotelli and he doesn't have enough time with the national squad.
