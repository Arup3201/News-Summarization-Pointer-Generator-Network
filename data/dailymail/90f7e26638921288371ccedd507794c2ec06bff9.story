Astrophysicist Alex Chambers was destined for a life of science before an offer to good to refuse changed the 24-year-old's career path.

The self-described 'nerd' and Australia's first female MMA fighter completed a degree in astrophysics after studying Maths and Physics - but will leave all that behind as she embarks on her dream of joining the Ultimate Fighting Championship in America.

The lightweight Sydney fighter, who has spent 16 years honing her mixed martial arts technique, will star in the first all-female season of The Ultimate Fighter when it debuts on September 10 on Australian television.

Sixteen female competitors will compete for the inaugural straw weight title.

Chambers, 24, had conquered Australia's amateur ranks, before she signed an American contract which was eventually bought out by UFC.

She told Vice in an interview about her rise through the martial arts grades back home and her quest to join the sport as a professional fighter.

Describing herself as 'Australia's best female fighter' she took a gamble and flew to Japan after becoming 'desperate' to find a fight after conquering the MMA scene back in Australia.

'My coach Liam and I decided that I should look to fight in Japan where the WMMA scene is much stronger,' she said.

'I’ve been doing martial arts since I was eight...it’s what I dream about awake or asleep...all the training in the world isn't worth a damn if you don't get to step inside a ring or a cage and throw down once in a while.'

Technique generates power, according to Chambers who relies on her 'smarts' to beat her opponents

Classified as a 'straw weight' competitor at just 52 kilograms, Chambers had to earn her keep the hard way and pay for the flights herself because she 'didn’t have a name yet.'

'So we had a fundraiser at my gym, VT1, and we flew over to fight.'

Forced to fight up two grades because of her size, she said she was unable to cope with the demand of the step-up in class and was subsequently beaten easily by her Japanese opponent.

After her defeat she took time away from the sport - until she signed an American contract that launched her UFC career in July.

At just 52 kilograms Alex Chambers is regarded as a 'straw weight' in the sport of MMA

The once-aspiring astrophysicist who now says MMA comes first, told Channel Nine's Today Show host Cameron Williams on Saturday that before MMA she 'had always been a bit of a nerd.'

'Science has been something that I love so I studied  physics, maths at university and astrophysics was one of those subjects I really enjoyed.'

Adding that while she has a career to fall back on, that side of her life has taken a backseat while she pursues the Ultimate Fighting Championship.

'MMA is the fastest growing sport in the world so it's definitely my career at the moment.'

Quashing speculation that the sport of MMA is a 'dangerous' one, she said fighters are well drilled in 'technique training' that generates the power and strength to compete.

'We train smart, it's not all about getting hit,' she said.

'We spend a lot of time practicing techniques and technique is what generates the power.'

The first all-female season of The Ultimate Fighter debuts September 10, where 16 female competitors will compete for the inaugural straw weight title.

The show, which features UFC lightweight champion Anthony Pettis and upcoming title challenger Gilbert Melendez as head coaches, features a tournament format as the long-running reality show crowns its first champion.
