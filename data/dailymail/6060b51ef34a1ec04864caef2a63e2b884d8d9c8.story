Australian actor Ryan Corr has left the Sydney Theatre Company just weeks before rehearsals for a production were due to begin following his arrest in May for allegedly smoking and possessing heroin.

The former Packed to the Rafters star is due to appear in court next month after he was charged when police found him in possession of the drug  in a laneway at Bondi, in Sydney's eastern suburbs, in May.

Corr, 25, was due to start rehearsals for the Sydney Theatre Company's production of Cyrano de Bergerac, which will open in November.

The company said in a statement that Corr's request to be released from the production was not related to his arrest, rather his departure was due to him being cast in a leading role in an Australian film, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

'We've accepted Ryan's request to withdraw from Cyrano de Bergerac to enable him to take on a leading role in a film,' the company's artistic director Andrew Utpon said.

While the company won't name the film, the Herald reports it is Holding the Man, which tells the story of a romance between playwright Timothy Conigrave and footballer Jogn Caleo.

'The man was allegedly in possession of a small amount of a prohibited drug,' New South Wales police told Daily Mail Australia.

'He was issued with a Field Court Attendance Notice for possession of a prohibited drug and appeared at Waverley Local Court on July 8. The matter was adjourned for mention on September 2'.

It was confirmed the substance was heroin and he was found with one freezer bag containing white powder, court documents say.

The young actor was praised by critics for his performance opposite veteran Australian actor John Jarratt in Wolf Creek 2

A Logie Award and former CLEO Bachelor of the Year nominee, Corr is currently filming British period drama series Banished and is set to star in The Water Diviner opposite Russell Crowe

Five days after his arrest Corr won a best performance award for his role in Wolf Creek 2 opposite John Jarratt at Nocturna, the Madrid International Fantastic Film Festival.

Corr is a former CLEO Bachelor of the Year nominee and recipient of the Heath Ledger Scholarship.

Health Ledger's father Kim, who presented Corr with an Australians in Film Heath Ledger Scholarship in 2011, said he had no 'empathy' for people who took drugs following Corr's arrest.

'It does make me sad to hear that because we have enough problems with alcohol and drugs,' Mr Ledger told The Sydney Morning Herald.

'I have some empathy for what happens around that situation with families but very little empathy for people that put it in their own mouth.

'We do what we can to help people but we're not involved in the pro-active side of it.'
