A couple whose soldier son died in Afghanistan were outraged when a flag they donated to a veterans' memorial was rejected.

Amy and Patrick Moore of Bordentown City, New Jersey were upset when their Honor and Remember flag was rejected for display in front of the Bordentown Veterans Memorial, The Philadelphia Inquirer reports.

The Moores' flag was originally accepted in January but later returned to the couple. The committee overseeing the site said the flag is 'fundamentally flawed' and violates the rules of display of the American flag.

Amy Moore told the paper that the Honor and Remember flag is an important reminder of soldiers' sacrifices.

'Memories fade, even for a mother and father who lost a child,' she said. 'But the flag reminds everyone of the men and women who lost their lives, from the Revolutionary War to the present day.'

The couple's son Army Spec. Benjamin Moore was killed in a bomb blast on January 12, 2011, which killed two others, the paper reports. He had served as a firefighter and emergency medical technician for the Bordentown fire department.

Critics of the flag's installation include committee chairman Bruce Throckmorton. He reportedly said the Honor and Remember flag could 'dilute the power of the American flag' and 'open the floodgates' to other flags.

Throckmorton also reportedly said at a March 6 town meeting that the flag should instead be at 'a civilian site.'

The flag apparently being questioned for its fabric durability as well as its registered trademark designation by local committee members. Others said it had not been officially adopted by the federal government.

However, both former Mayor James Lynch, now deputy mayor, as well as current Mayor Joe Malone have displayed three other flags donated by Moores, the paper reports. One hangs inside a community center while the other two fly from poles at the municipal building and a boat launch.

The Moores reportedly tried to have the flag displayed at a building next to the memorial after their initial efforts failed.

The couple is expected to continue donating flags throughout New Jersey.

'When Ben was killed, our lives changed forever,' Amy Moore told the paper. 'We're on a new path and new journey, moving on to present flags throughout the community.'
