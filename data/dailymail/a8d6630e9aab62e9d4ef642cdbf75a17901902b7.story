Teenage midfielder Kingsley Coman snubbed Arsenal and Liverpool to join Italian champions Juventus.

The 18-year-old, known in France as the new Paul Pogba, made four appearances for Paris Saint German since February 2013, when he became their youngest ever player.

But after failing to break into the first team he decided to follow Pogba to Juventus, despite offers from the two Premier League clubs.

Rejection: Coman, who only played for times for PSG, snubbed Liverpool and Arsenal

'Juventus has a history with French players,' Coman told French newspaper L'Equipe.

'Some of them did very good. So I told myself, why not me? I thought about it a lot. I had to take a decision regarding PSG.

'Then there was Arsenal, Liverpool, Leverkusen, Bayern Munich and Bordeaux. I've hesitated a lot about Bordeaux and I talked with Willy Sagnol, I knew him from the France Under-21 team and he promised me playing time.

'But this process came a little too late and I was already thinking about Juve.'

Coman has signed a five-year deal with Juventus after a decade in the PSG youth system. He has been capped for France at every age group from Under-16 to Under-21.
