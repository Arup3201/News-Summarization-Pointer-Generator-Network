Jose Mourinho has admitted Chelsea are interested in signing Cesc Fabregas from Barcelona as the midfielder’s Spain team-mate Gerard Pique let slip a £26.8million deal is already done.

The Chelsea manager said it was clear Fabregas wants to return to the Premier League, three years after leaving Arsenal, and revealed he is ‘monitoring the situation’ with a view to securing a deal after the World Cup.

The Blues are also ready to offer Eden Hazard £200,000 a week to keep him from Paris Saint-Germain’s clutches.

Done deal: Cesc Fabreagas has moved to Chelsea, according to Spain team-mate Gerard Pique

Admission: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho admitted the club are interested in the former Arsenal star

On the Spanish midfielder, Mourinho said: ‘We have some (interest in Fabregas). I have interest in analysing the situation.

‘It looks like he’s really interested in leaving Barcelona, and is very interested in coming back to England. This is clear. But it’s not for now, or tomorrow, or for before the World Cup.

‘There is a process where he wants to leave, he wants to come to England because it’s the country where he wants to be and where he prefers to play. We are interested in monitoring the situation.’

Pique, however, believes the deal has 
already been done. The defender was caught on camera in Washington 
telling Spain coach Vicente del Bosque that Fabregas will leave for 
£26.8m this summer after Barcelona ended the season without winning any 
silverware.

Team-mates? Fabregas could join Spanish striker Diego Costa at Stamford Bridge next season

The midfielder, 27, qualifies as a home-grown player in the Premier League after spending eight years at Arsenal and has expressed his interest in moving back to England after just three years in his native Catalonia, with two years left on his Barcelona contract.

Pique is overheard telling Del Bosque, albeit with a smile: ‘He (Fabregas) told me that it is already done. He is leaving already, 33 million euros he said.’

The defender had earlier told Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo: ‘Cesc has never been sufficiently evaluated in Barcelona. He is not valued as he deserves.

‘Cesc would work in any club in the world, but this club is very complicated.’

Bumper offer: Chelsea are prepared to offer Eden Hazard £200,000 a week to keep him from PSG

Del Bosque was not happy that the comments were made public, saying: 'I think it was unfair that the conversation was leaked,' before adding on Fabregas: 'It's not for me to assess the clubs' decisions. He's a Spain player and I must say he's training brilliantly. He's really useful anywhere on the pitch".

Chelsea's new No 10 Eden Hazard will be be offered a bumper pay rise amid increasing speculation that PSG are preparing a whopping £61m bid.

PSG manager Laurent Blanc has spoken publicly about his desire to bring the Belgium international to the French capital next season.

Discreet overtures between Hazard's representatives and officials at the mega-rich Ligue 1 club have already taken place.

But the Blues will look to ward off interest from France by handing the exciting forward a new deal - that will see his current £170,000-per-week deal rise to nearer £200,000.

Mega bid: PSG boss is a keen admirer of Hazard and the club are preparing a £61m bid

His current contract still has three years left to run, and Chelsea hope the statement of intent of extended terms will be enough to keep Hazard at Stamford Bridge.

However, that is unlikely to keep PSG from pursuing Hazard this summer as they plot a huge £61million bid.

The Parisien club are convinced Hazard is obtainable this summer and that Chelsea are willing to do business at the right price.

Chelsea have given Hazard the coveted No 10 shirt to wear next season, a further indication of their determination to the forward.
