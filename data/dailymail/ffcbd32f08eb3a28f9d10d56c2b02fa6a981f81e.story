Pope Francis showed why he's the leader of the Catholic Church and not a major league baseball star yesterday when he urged a fan to throw him a baseball - and dropped it.

The energetic 77-year-old was meeting crowds in St Peter's Square, Vatican City, when he spotted the onlooker just yards away behind a barrier clutching the ball.

He urged the fan to throw the ball his way, despite some nervous looks from his security detail - who may well have suspected it to be a cunningly disguised hand grenade.

The ball bounced in the pope's right hand before falling to the floor - and failing to explode, no doubt to his minders' relief.

They dived to retrieve it for Francis, ABC News reported, who then signed it and returned to its owner.

The incident came as Francis was returning to his quarters after his weekly audience in St Peter's Square, where he urged international assistance to fight the Ebola virus in Africa.

Francis also urged the 30,000 people who attended to pray for the victims.

It was the second time in as many days that Francis has raised the alarm about Ebola and called for international assistance to care for those affected.

He issued a similar appeal Tuesday during a meeting with bishops visiting from Ghana.
