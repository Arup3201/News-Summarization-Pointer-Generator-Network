Action: Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick has signed a bill prohibiting 'upskirt' photos of women

Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick has signed a bill prohibiting 'upskirt' photos of women just two days after the state's highest court ruled that taking photos of a woman's private parts was legal in certain circumstances.

Patrick's office said the governor signed the measure today, after the Supreme Judicial Court controversially overruled a lower court which upheld charges against a man who took cellphone photos up the skirts of female subway passengers in Boston.

Michael Robertson was arrested in August 2010 by transit police who set up a sting after getting reports that he was using his cellphone to take photos and video up female riders' skirts and dresses.

On Wednesday, the Supreme Judicial Court ruled that Robertson did not violate state law because the women were not nude or partially nude, even though they did not consent to the photos.

The court said that existing so-called 'Peeping Tom laws' protect people from being photographed in dressing rooms and bathrooms when nude or partially nude, but the way the law is written, it does not protect clothed people in public areas.

'A female passenger on a MBTA trolley who is wearing a skirt, dress, or the like covering these parts of her body is not a person who is "partially nude," no matter what is or is not underneath the skirt by way of underwear or other clothing,' the court said in its ruling.

State law 'does not apply to photographing (or videotaping or electronically surveilling) persons who are fully clothed and, in particular, does not reach the type of upskirting that the defendant is charged with attempting to accomplish on the MBTA,' the court said.

However, the ruling immediately prompted top Beacon Hill lawmakers to pledge to update state law.

Lawmakers yesterday approved legislation to crack down on those who secretly take photographs of 'the sexual or other intimate parts' of men, women and children in public.

'It is sexual harassment. It's an assault on another person whether it's a child or an adult,' Senate President Therese Murray said moments after the Senate unanimously approved the bill.

'Women and children should be able to go to public places without feeling that they are not protected by the law.'

The legislation says anyone who 'photographs, videotapes or electronically surveils' another person's sexual or intimate parts without that person's consent would face a misdemeanor charge and a maximum penalty of two-and-a-half years in jail and a $5,000 fine.

The crime becomes a felony with a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine for photographs or recordings of a child under 18.

Distributing such photos would carry a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Murray said those who take such photos sometimes post them on pornographic websites.

House Speaker Robert DeLeo said the Legislature moved swiftly after the Supreme Judicial Court issued its ruling on Wednesday.

'Not only did we get it done quickly, but I think there was a feeling that we did it right,' he said. 'We wanted to make sure that this would be a law that would pass all legal questions that could arise.'

In the past three years, MBTA police have investigated 13 'secretly photographing' cases. In some cases, the alleged offender was issued a court summons. Some remain open investigations.
