A group of international military observers captured by pro-Russian rebels are being held as ‘human shields’, according to the Ukrainian government.

Kiev said the eight foreigners, who were in Ukraine to gather information about the worsening security situation, were being detained in ‘inhuman’ conditions.

But last night the hostages were denounced by their captors as Nato spies. The escalating tension heightened fears of an imminent Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine.

Foreign observers were gathering information about security situation, the Ukrainian government has claimed

As the two sides traded insults in increasingly bellicose language:

The main flashpoint yesterday was the seizure by pro-Moscow paramilitaries of monitors from the Organisation for Security and Co-Operation in Europe, a Vienna-based body whose 57 member states include Russia.

The monitors included German, Swedish, Danish, Polish and Czech nationals, as well as Ukrainian army officers accompanying them.

The Ukrainian State Security Service said the hostages were being detained ‘in inhuman conditions in the basement of the terrorists’ headquarters’ in the eastern city of Slaviansk.

It claimed the operation had been planned and co-ordinated by a Russian special services agent, though this was denied by Moscow.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk cut short a visit to Rome, where he asked the Pope to pray for his country, to fly home to face the crisis

Mr Yatsenyuk said: ‘Russian military aircraft overnight crossed and violated Ukrainian air space seven times. The only reason is to provoke Ukraine to start a war.’

He said Moscow, which has sent thousands of troops to the border, was looking for a pretext to invade.

Meanwhile, leaders of the Group of Seven major economies agreed  to impose additional sanctions on Russia.

US officials said new measures aimed at Putin ‘cronies’ could be unveiled tomorrow unless Moscow took immediate action to defuse the crisis.

Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaite yesterday welcomed 150 US paratroopers. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have been members of Nato since 2004 but until now have not allowed foreign troops to be stationed on their territory, partly to avoid antagonising Russia.

But that policy has now been abandoned and 600 American soldiers are being sent to the Baltic states and Poland as Washington attempts to reassure its European allies about their security after Moscow’s intervention in Ukraine.

Ukraine fears a Russian incursion on the pretext of guaranteeing security for referendums next month on whether eastern regions of the country should split from Kiev and become part of the Russian Federation.

A source in Moscow said last night: ‘The crisis is at its most critical.’
