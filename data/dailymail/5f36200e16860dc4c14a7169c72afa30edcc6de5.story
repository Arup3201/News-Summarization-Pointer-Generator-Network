An Arkansas high school has created controversy after officials pulled a profile of an openly gay student from appearing in the annual yearbook.

The Yellowjacket was scheduled to feature an interview with Taylor Ellis, 17, about his experience coming out as homosexual last year, until school officials for the Sheridan School District pulled it.

On Tuesday, representatives from the Human Rights Campaign, a national organization that promotes civil rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, staged a demonstration on the State Capitol steps in support of Ellis.

The group said it had collected more than 30,000 signatures, thousands of them from Arkansans, on an online petition calling for the profile to be published.

At a news conference organized by the Human Rights Campaign, Ellis said he didn't understand the school's decision.

‘It’s not something I’m ashamed of. In fact, I’m proud of who I am. That’s why I can’t understand why my school was trying to force me back into the closet.’

In a statement, Superintendent Brenda Haynes of the Sheridan School District said the school would ‘not make decisions based on demands by any special interest group.’

‘We must make decisions that lead in the proper direction for all of our students and for our community,’ she said.

‘We have reviewed state law, court cases, and our own policies. It is clear that the adults who have the responsibility for the operation of the District have the obligation to make decisions which are consistent with the mission of our school. We have done so.’

Rather than publish Ellis’ story, the district decided to scrap all seven profiles that had been prepared for publication.

‘They don't want to just throw out the gay kid's interview,’ the yearbook's assistant editor, Hannah Bruner, told KATV. It was her who had profiled Ellis.

The yearbook's assistant editor Hannah Bruner said she had profiled Ellis because it was a story that didn't get talked about much in Sheridan

‘It's a big thing in Sheridan to be gay. That is something that doesn't get told a lot.’

She said the profile told how Ellis had been frightened at first, but then had found most of the student body and teachers very accepting of him.

At Tuesday’s protest Ellis’ mother, Lynn Tiley, said she was told administrators were concerned that the profile of Ellis was 'too personal' and might endanger his well-being.

'I accepted it, and everybody else needs to accept it as well,' she said, close to tears.

The Human Rights Campaign urged Gov. Mike Beebe and the state's education commissioner, Tom Kimbrell, to intervene, but representatives of their offices said it was a matter for the local school district.
