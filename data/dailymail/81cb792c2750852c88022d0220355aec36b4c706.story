A Tory MP has told people who bought houses near a village cricket club to stop complaining about their broken windows and buy stronger glass.

Charlie Elphicke said it was not fair for new residents in the Kent village of St Margaret’s to demand the club spent £35,000 on a fence to protect their homes from balls hit for six.

The Dover MP warned the huge bill could force the closure of the club, which is just yards from his own home.

Trouble: People living near the pitch at the St Margaret's cricket club argue they should not have to keep paying for repairs

Residents have complained to the St Margaret’s parish council about the impact of cricket balls breaking windows and smashing roof tiles.

The council owns the the King George V playing field, where the club has two Saturday sides and plays friendlies on Sundays.

Dave Hart, chairman of the council, said that both the council and the club were jointly liable for the damage caused.

While nets were expensive, he thought 
they might be the only option. ‘We are endeavouring to find ways of 
solving this problem,’ he said.

But the idea of erecting a 30-foot high fence to stop balls going astray was condemned by Mr Elphicke.

He told MailOnline: ‘The cricket club has been there for a very long time, those houses have not.

‘At the end of the day, they bought these houses knowing there was a cricket club.

‘To turn around and say the cricket club should fork out thousands is not right. People should buy stronger glass.

‘An important part of village life is the village cricket ground and to pay a whole lot of money for these sorts of changes could well mean the cricket club is lost.’

Division: The row has dominated the village, where Tory MP Charlie Elphicke lives, with opinion split over who should pick up the bill for broken windows or a new safety fence

However, a local resident calling himself David, said Mr Elphicke had to ‘get a grip’, adding: ‘We can’t just all go out and spend £5,000 on new windows.’

Another resident, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Whenever there is a cricket match on everyone around here knows to park their cars somewhere else and batten down the hatches.

‘The balls come whizzing out of the ground like a bat out of hell and countless cars as well as windows and tiles of neighbouring homes have been damaged.’
