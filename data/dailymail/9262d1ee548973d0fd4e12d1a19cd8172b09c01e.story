Hundreds of travelers were last night trapped at New
York City's Penn Station on the eve of Thanksgiving as all trains were suspended on one of the busiest transportation
arteries.

Train service was halted at 5.20pm due to a switching problem in the 
tracks right at the point where trains enter and leave the station, officials said. The suspensions included all three train services - Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and Long Island Rail Road.

The station was reopened an hour later and trains began running just before 7pm.

However the switching kink led to severe 
overcrowding in New York City's biggest train hub on one of the busiest travel days of the 
year, as hundreds upon hundreds of travelers were scheduled to head home for the Thanksgiving holiday.

Trapped: Hundreds of travelers at New York City's Penn Station on the eve of Thanksgiving as all train service was suspended - but later reopened

Locked out: Police prohibited travelers from entering Penn Station until service was restored just before 7pm on Wednesday

Disruption: Train service was suspended at 5.20pm due to a switching problem in the tracks

Police prohibited travelers from entering Penn Station until service was restored to try and mitigate the crowding but did not force anyone out of the building.

Some 
travelers opted to drive to their destinations. But with the roads 
clogged with congestion, driving was not necessarily a better option.

More than 39 million people were on the nation's roads at 5pm on Wednesday, 
driving at least 50 miles each, according to AAA.

At airports there were already 300 cancellations and more than 4,200 delayed flights as the north suffers poor weather.

Chicago
O'Hare and Midway airports have been hard hit by dense fog, with as 
many as 180 flights cancelled and 680 delayed, causing slow-moving lines
to snake through terminals.

Shut down: Among the services suspended at Penn Station on Wednesday was the Long Island Rail Road, which serves nearly 300,000 passengers on a typical day

O'Hare is the second biggest airport in the U.S. and a major hub for both United 
and American airlines while Midway is one of the biggest bases for 
low-cost giant Southwest.

The cancellations sparked 
problems for thousands of travelers in other areas of the country where
the weather was better.

The city’s aviation department predicted that nearly 1.8 million travelers will use the two airports over the eight-day Thanksgiving travel period, which ends next Tuesday.

'Both are reporting visibility near zero,' Gino Izzi, a 
meteorologist at the National Weather Service, told the Chicago Tribune on Wednesday.

'It’s going to be an 
absolutely awful morning and will probably go into the afternoon at 
most airports.'

Fog: Travelers posted pictures to social network sites of the fog clogging Chicago on Wednesday

Struggle: Visibility was also poor on roads in Illinois, Missouri, Wisconsin, Iowa and Indiana

Dense: The fog in Chicago, pictured, will also impact other flights in areas of the country where weather is fair

Fliers nervously watched departure boards inside the airports, hopeful that the fog would pass and clear the delays, which are 90 minutes on average.

'We couldn't see any road signs in front of us, or the house next door, so we left three hours early,' Hannah Ducey, who is travelling to Nashville, told CBS at O'Hare.

Lines also stretched along 
expressways in Illinois as drivers battled the fog. Around two 
million people took to the roads across the state, a spokeswoman 
from the AAA said.

'I think the fog is going to have some effect on either people's 
decisions on when they’re going to leave or certainly, if they're out, 
in getting to where they want to go today,' she added.

Plans: Travelers check their flights at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, where hundreds of flights are delayed

By 3.30pm on Wednesday, there were cancellations and delays at 40 airports. Among the most affected were:

O'Hare International Airport, Chicago 87 cancellations, 433 delays

Midway Airport, Chicago 12 cancellations, 169 delays

Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, St. Louis 9 cancellations, 78 delays

La Guardia Airport, New York 6 cancellations, 63 delays

Newark Liberty International Airport, New Jersey 5 cancellations, 104 delays

Louisville International Airport, Kentucky 3 cancellations, 109 delays

A dense fog advisory is also in effect for much of Missouri and Wisconsin, as well 
as eastern Iowa and northwest Indiana.

But
the weather could also spell trouble for motorists in the Pacific 
Northwest, where travellers should be braced for a soggy ride.

Oregon has experienced up to 10 inches 
of rain, and there have been nine inches in some parts of Washington and
6.5 inches in Northern California.

And while weather should remain mild for
motorists along the East Coast, families should still expect 
slow-crawling traffic across the entire country.

Roads in New York, Washington D.C, Chicago, San 
Francisco, and Los Angeles will be particularly trying, with journeys expected to take 33 per cent longer than usual, ABC reported.

The AAA suggests families travelling on the country's roads leave as early as possible, and should expect to be travelling in gridlock by around 5pm on Wednesday.

'With today expected to be the busiest 
day, and many people also working, we're expecting this evening there 
will be a lot of congestion,' AAA spokeswoman Heather Hunter said.

Families travelling through Los Angeles 
can also expect delays as airport union workers prepare to strike on 
Wednesday morning in a battle over health insurance plans.

The march, comprised of more than 
1,000 workers and their supporters, could snarl traffic around the 
airport on the already-hectic travel day, Los Angeles International
Airport officials said.

The airport warned travellers to add 90 minutes to their planned arrival times.

Even the workers admit they could not have picked a worse day or a busier airport, ABC reported.

'It's a national day about being with 
your family and taking care of your family, and these workers are not 
able to do that,' Andrew Gross Gaitan, from the Seiu United Service Workers
West, said.

The number of 
travellers flying is down this year, to 3.1 million, even though the 
average domestic airfare is down 11 per cent compared to last year.

But travel company Orbitz said most planes will still be full throughout Thanksgiving.

'We're not expecting a big drop in the number of people on planes. People still want to get away this weekend,' said Jeanenne Tornatore from the company.

Thanksgiving is also the busiest time of the year for Amtrak, which has borrowed carriages from its Canadian counterpart to make 300 additional seats available on trains running in the Northeast.
