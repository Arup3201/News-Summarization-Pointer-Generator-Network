Mark Zuckerberg recently promised to 'change the way we communicate' when he announced Facebook was buying VR firm Oculus for $2bn.

Now it is believed Hollywood could also be at the forefront of the virtual revolution thanks to a radical new 360 degree camera that could allowed movies to be filmed for VR headsets.

Experts say the films would put viewers right in the heart of the action, and could be a radical departure form today's entertainment.

The Jaunt camera will allow Hollywood to create the first VR movies

The Jaunt camera system simultaneously records 3D stereoscopic video in all directions and has a unique design that can be flexibly configured for different projects.

The firm has also developed a 3D sound-field microphone, allowing it to 'capture the complete visual and auditory experience'

Once captured, the camera images and audio are electronically stitched together to create a 360 scene users can look around simply by moving their head.

The camera, called Jaunt, uses a series of lenses mounted on a dome to capture images.

When stitched together electronically, they can create a scene a user can 'look around' using a VR headset.

'Jaunt cinematic VR allows consumers to step into their entertainment like never before,' the firm boasts.

'It provides a completely immersive, 360-degree 3D video and audio experience for viewers, allowing them to see and hear BMX bikers zoom past them, watch as battles rage all around them or transport them on amazing trips to exotic locations around the world.

'Viewers take complete control, with the ability to look around in any direction.

The firm says it hopes to broaden VR beyond games.

'VR as it exists today is mainly about video games,' said Jens Christensen, CEO of Jaunt.

'We want to broaden the VR experience to mainstream entertainment.

'Jaunt has built the technology to put virtual reality in the hands of the best content creators in the world to deliver stunning, reach-out-and-touch-it entertainment experiences using VR goggles.

'Jaunt provides an end-to-end solution for producing cinema-quality experiences that are simply unforgettable,' said Arthur van Hoff, CTO of Jaunt.

Jaunt uses its own specially written software to stitch the images together

'Our cross-platform viewer allows for playback on many devices and provides an accurate, extremely realistic presentation of the visual and sonic content of the scene in all directions.

The firm hopes to work with existing Hollywood giants to create the first VR movies, and recently announced $6.8 million in venture funding from top investors, including British Sky Broadcasting.

'Our customers tell us they love having the richest and most immersive TV experience possible, which is why we are so excited about the supporting Jaunt and its ground-breaking video capture technology.

'As an innovative content creator, cinematic VR represents exactly the type of technology we want to better understand and explore.' said Stuart Murphy, Director of Entertainment Channels at Sky.

The camera is being reveald just weeks after announced that it has reached a definitive agreement to acquire Oculus VR, a California firm founded by 21 year old college dropout Palmer Luckey that is developing leading VR headset.

'Mobile is the platform of today, and now we're also getting ready for the platforms of tomorrow,' said Facebook founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg.

The future of Facebook? The Oculus Rift headset in action. Facebook today bought the firm for $2bn

MailOnline was able to try Oculus Rift at the CES show in Las Vegas earlier this year.

At first we were skeptical - the headset looks bulky, although it is surprisingly light when  attached via straps.

However, once our demo started, doubts were quickly forgotten.

The technology, still just a developer's version, is breathtakingly good.

While the resolution still doesn't give the feeling of quite being in the real world, it does make you think you are actually in a virtual world.

During several demonstrations we entered a vast dungeon and flew through space, with head tracking meaning the images moved perfectly as the user's head moves.

It's not quite ready for primetime yet, but is almost there - and the Oculus Rift headset finally delivers on the long awaited promise of virtual reality.

'It's different from anything I've every experienced in my life,' said Zuckerberg.

The firm is among the most advanced in the VR field, and recently began taking orders for the latest version of its $350 developers version.

'Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever, and change the way we work, play and communicate,' said Zuckerberg.

'Immersive gaming will be the first, and Oculus already has big plans here that won't be changing and we hope to accelerate.

'The Rift is highly anticipated by the gaming community, and there's a lot of interest from developers in building for this platform.

'We're going to focus on helping Oculus build out their product and develop partnerships to support more games.

'Oculus will continue operating independently within Facebook to achieve this.

'But this is just the start.

'After games, we're going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences.

'Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face - just by putting on goggles in your home.'

The $2bn deal includes $400 million in cash and 23.1 million shares of Facebook common stock.

Oculus is the leader in immersive virtual reality technology and has already built strong interest among developers, having received more than 75,000 orders for development kits for the company's virtual reality headset, the Oculus Rift. 

Facebook said 'While the applications for virtual reality technology beyond gaming are in their nascent stages, several industries are already experimenting with the technology, and Facebook plans to extend Oculus' existing advantage in gaming to new verticals, including communications, media and entertainment, education and other areas.'

The Oculus prototype, pictured, is packed with components - many of which Mark Zuckerberg claims can be found in a mobile phone, making the gadget relatively easy to produce

'We are excited to work with Mark and the Facebook team to deliver the very best virtual reality platform in the world,' said Brendan Iribe, co-founder and CEO of Oculus VR.

'We believe virtual reality will be heavily defined by social experiences that connect people in magical, new ways. 

'It is a transformative and disruptive technology, that enables the world to experience the impossible, and it's only just the beginning.'

Oculus recently raised $75m to make the headset.

'Over the past 16 months, weâ€™ve grown from a startup to a company whose technology is poised to change the way we play, work and communicate,' said Brendan Iribe, CEO of Oculus VR at the time.
