This video shows the amazing moment an eight-year-old boy brought commuters to tears with a full Chopin piano recital in the middle of St Pancras station.

Jay Lewington, who taught himself to play by watching YouTube tutorials, stopped passengers in their tracks as he performed Frédéric Chopin's 'Fantaisie Impromptu' in the packed London train station. 

The footage, shot by his mother Camille Lewington, shows the talented musician faultlessly playing the classical composition, presumably while waiting to board a train or for a loved one to arrive.

The new Mozart? Eight-year-old Jay Lewington performed Frédéric Chopin's 'Fantaisie Impromptu' in the middle of St Pancras station, in London, after teaching himself by watching YouTube tutorials

Jay is seen sat down at one of the pianos placed in the concourse at the international train station for the public to enjoy. 

'Play Me, I'm Yours,' a sign on the piano reads. 

At one point in the video, an astonished onlooker tries to interrupt the primary school-aged boy to hand him a £10 note, but he continues with the song regardless.

After the video went viral, Jay was compared to Mozart, another boy genius who created his first few compositions aged four or five. 

Ms Lewington uploaded the incredible video to YouTube last June and it has now been watched nearly 240,000 times.

Sending a message to the thousands of viewers, Jay's mother wrote: 'Hi, Jay's mum here. Just wanted to say thank you from Jay for some of the lovely comments he has had - I've just read some of them out to him and his face lit up.'

'The lady [who approaches Jay] was a complete stranger to us who was so moved by his playing that she was reduced to tears. The reason she interrupted was to try and give him a ten pound note and to tell Jay that he reminded her so much of her dear brother.

'At the end of the video you can briefly see and hear her telling him this - along with the rest of the "audience" that had gathered to watch. Thanks again for all of your lovely comments.'

Hundreds have people have commented on the video to show their appreciation of Jay's talent.

YouTube user Aaron Simonds said: 'This is just beautiful... thank you for sharing.'

Peggy Brown, from Kentucky, wrote: 'I am in awe of Jay's talent at such a young age. I would have given anything to have been able to play like Jay. Please continue playing and enjoying your gift.'

And Carl McPhee said: 'Wish I could play like this. This piece so difficult to play. I'm 30 and still can't play like this. It's great!'
