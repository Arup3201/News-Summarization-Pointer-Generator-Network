PM Narendra Modi beating a traditional Taiko drum in Tokyo

On the fourth day of his Japanese visit, he turned on the charm. 

Prime Minister Narendra Modi displayed his softer side - playing traditional Japanese Taiko drums, humming Vande Mataram, addressing scholars at the Sacred Heart University on women’s empowerment, and posing for selfies with students - to conquer hearts and minds in Japan on Tuesday.

Modi also addressed four different gatherings, pitching India as the perfect investment destination for Japanese business and industry leaders. 

Modi began his day with an address to women scholars at the Sacred Heart University in Tokyo, even letting some of the overjoyed students take selfies with him.

Later, chants of ‘Har Har Modi’ went up outside the Indian Embassy in Tokyo moments after the prime minister arrived to inaugurate the Vivekanand Centre there. 

School and college students skipped classes and waited hours to catch a glimpse of Modi, who left his security cordon later to mingle with them, signing autographs left and right. 

The headline event, of course, was when Modi tried his hand at playing traditional Japanese drums (Taiko) at the launch of Tata Consultancy Service’s (TCS) new programme for Japanese students, and excelled. 

Business mantras

The business part of Modi’s Japan campaign was replete with punchy mantras. 

“There is no red tape, only a red carpet,” he declared to the who’s who of Japanese business and industry in a packed-to-capacity hall that had many listeners standing in the corridor. 

Modi delivered a “3D formula” for investment. 

“We are a vibrant democracy; our demography ensures the youngest workforce in the world, and there is great demand–India is the biggest market for Japan,’’ he told a gathering organised by the Nikkei Inc and Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO). 

Modi told the captains of industry that investing in India would be a win-win situation for them, and that India is a land of tremendous advantage for Japan.

“The cost of manufacturing is very high in Japan. Move to India to cut costs of manufacturing and aim for returns within two years that you would have got after 10 years in Japan,’’ he said.

The capacity of the hall at Tokyo’s Okura hotel was 2,000, but Modi was told over 4,000 had applied to listen to him and half had to be turned down. 

Modi remarked that this was an indication of Japan’s keenness to engage more deeply with India. 

He spelt out details of how Japan could earn tremendous returns on its investments given the size of the markets in India.

“Take for example the metro train (mass rapid transport system). Fifty cities in India are waiting for the Metro. Imagine the size of investment, manufacturing and return for those engaged in this line of manufacturing,’’ he said. 

Modi said India would be the centre of the global economy in times to come. Embellishing his “Make in India” line, Modi held up Maruti Suzuki as an example. 

“Try your luck in India. It is the land of opportunity. Invest in India because of the ease of business,’’ he told the audience, promising not just single window clearance but any other facilities that manufacturers may need. 

 

PM wonders if presenting Gita will become a 'secular' issue

PM Modi on Tuesday took a dig at the ‘seculars’ in the country and wondered if there would be debates on the issue of his presenting the Srimad Bhagwat Gita to Japan’s Emperor Akihito and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. 

Speaking to the Indian diaspora in Tokyo in his fifth address of the day, Modi, tongue firmly in cheek, said he had no problems with such issues being debated on TV as everyone had to earn a living. 

He insisted he was firm in his convictions and would continue to pass on the message of the Bhagwat Gita to the world.

'Har Har Modi in Tokyo'  

Chants of Har Har Modi, Ghar Ghar Modi rang outside the Indian Embassy in Tokyo moments after PM Narendra Modi arrived to inaugurate the Vivekanand Centre. School and college students had been waiting since 2pm as the Embassy chose to keep the exact time of Modi’s arrival a secret. 

“We love you Modi ji,” screamed schoolchildren as Modi walked out breaking security cordon to meet them. 

“He asked me what class was I in. I told him I had cut classes just to catch a glimpse of him. He told me to do well at school,” said Meenakshi, one of the children. 

Spending a few moments with Indian community members, PM Modi returned to his cavalcade for his next engagement.

Goddess tales 

PM Modi’s day began early as he addressed women scholars at the Sacred Heart University in Tokyo. This was an attempt to reach out to the next generation in Japan. 

Modi told the girls how women were compared to Goddesses in India and gave them examples of Goddess Saraswati worshiped for education, Goddess Lakshmi for wealth, Goddess Annapoorna for food and Goddess Kali for safety. 

He elaborated on special schemes for the education of the girl child, giving details of how he auctioned all the gifts he got as Gujarat CM for 14 years and presented the Gujarat government with a cheque of Rs 78 crore for the education of the girls. 

After the address, several girls clicked photographs with him. 

A day earlier Modi played a flute at the Taimei Elementary School in Tokyo. In fact he gave the children a little explanation about the flute, narrating the story of Lord Krishna and his ability to mesmerise the world, including animals with his flute. 

Modi said Lord Krishna was a cowherd and would take cows into the forest but the moment he began playing the flute at dusk the cows would immediately come to him and he would shepherd them back to Gokul. 

 

Another feather in Modi's cap 

PM Modi playing the traditional Japanese drums (Taiko) was the last thing on the mind of the organisers of the launch of Tata Consultancy Service’s (TCS) new programme for Japanese students. 

Welcoming an honoured guest by playing the Taiko is a traditional Japanese form. 

PM Modi listened to the drummer couple in rapt attention before taking the drum sticks and playing the drums like an expert. 

The Japanese drummer initially watched and then suddenly joined Prime Minister Modi as the two belted out a fast rhythm for a minute or so before thunderous applause broke out.

Netaji's associate 

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday met Saichiro Misumi, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose’s oldest living associate in Japan, at a function in Tokyo. 

Modi met Misumi, 99, at a reception hosted by India-Japan Association and Japan-India Parliamentary Friendship League. 

At the function, Modi noted that the 93- year-old man remembers details about Subhash Chandra Bose and said he has asked Indian Ambassador to Japan Deepa Wadhwa to depute a highly professional video team to be with him for a month and interview him.
