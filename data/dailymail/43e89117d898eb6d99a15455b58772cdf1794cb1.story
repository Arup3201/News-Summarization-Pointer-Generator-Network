Microsoft probably didn’t have this in mind when they created the Xbox - but British researchers are to use the games console for parts when they send it up into space.

They hope that the Kinect technology will allow the craft to ‘see’ another satellite they have are also planning to launch orbit and allow the two to dock.

The team will also be putting a Google Nexus phone inside which will serve as its on board computer.

Their craft is the STRaND-2, or Surrey Training Research and Nanosatellite Development, and is an attempt to use everyday electronics in space craft

The researchers are turning to the Xbox because they are cheap to use and Microsoft has already done the hard part of creating the technology.

Their craft is the STRaND-2, or Surrey Training Research and Nanosatellite Development, and is an attempt to use everyday electronics in space craft.

STRaND-1 is already completed and set for launch but both are smaller than a shoebox and cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, compared to millions for the full size version.

They do not even have any rockets of their own so need to piggyback another craft to get into space.

The Kinect technology would work in the same way that it does for Xbox games - by identifying players, or in this case another satellite, and tracking where they move.

This would ensure they lock onto each other and dock smoothly, something which has not been tried with space ships as small as this.

If it works, the technology could be used on bigger space craft and significantly bring down the cost of space travel.

Everyday electronics such as the Kinect motion sensor from Xbox will be used for the hi-tech docking procedure

SSTL project lead Shaun Kenyon said that he hoped the satellites could one day make ‘grocery runs’ for other vessels in orbit by bringing them new computers or spare batteries, or doing other routine maintenance.

He said he was inspired by the autonomous model helicopter that had been created by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and asked himself: ‘Why has no-one used this in space?’

He said: ‘Once you can launch low cost nanosatellites that dock together, the possibilities are endless - like space building blocks’.STRaND-1 is due for launch later this year and STRaND-2 is currently under construction.
