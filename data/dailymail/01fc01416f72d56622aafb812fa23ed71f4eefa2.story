The alleged drug dealer suspected of selling Philip Seymour Hoffman drugs has been closely acquainted with other drug-addicted celebrities who have died from overdoses, including Amy Winehouse and artist Jean-Michel Basquiat.

Robert Vineberg, also known as Robert Aaron, has a long list of credits as a musician, and an equally long list of connections to addicted celebrities.

Vineberg, 57, has admitted to being addicted to heroin, but denies selling Hoffman any of the drug found in his apartment.

Another acquaintance: Philip Seymour Hoffman was found dead with 70 bags of heroin in his West Village apartment

He is now facing a felony charge of heroin possession with
 intent to sell following his arrest on in his apartment on Mott Street in the pricey Nolita district of Manhattan.

The Canadian-born musician appeared on the New York scene as a teenager in the 1970s and befriended other artists and musicians.

He was a friend of the late New York artist Jean-Michel Basquiat in the 1980s.

According to TMZ, the pair spent a lot of time doing heroin together in Vineberg's apartment - the same apartment Hoffman allegedly visited to score heroin.

Basquiat died of a heroin overdose in 1988.

Vineberg's stepdaughter Christine Soto admitted that Hoffman had visited 
the apartment where her stepfather sold drugs before adding: 'But he had
 nothing to do with what killed him.'

Accomplished musician: Robert Vineberg released his own album, Trouble Man, in 2010

Known addict: Vineberg worked with Amy Winehouse on her debut album Frank

She said that Vineberg turned to selling drugs to 'pay his rent.'

Soto told the New York Post that he had tried to find other work when he had difficulty paying bills as a musician, but couldn't even get hired as a dishwasher.

Vineberg and Hoffman were friends for about a year before the actor's death, but Vineberg had not seen him since November, she said.

Vineberg, who played with 
the singer Amy Winehouse is one of three people arrested in New York for
 alleged drug offences following actor Philip Seymour Hoffman's death.

The
 57-year-old performed on the popstar's best-selling album Frank in 2003
 and claims to have worked with other singers including Wyclef Jean, 
Mick Jagger, David Bowie and Tom Jones.

Two law enforcement officials said at least one of them had the actor's phone number.

Investigators zeroed in on the four after a tipster, responding to publicity about Hoffman's death, told police he had seen Hoffman at the lower Manhattan apartment building where they were arrested and he believed that's where Hoffman got the heroin, the officials said Wednesday.

In searches of two apartments in the building, police found hundreds of packets of heroin in one of them, according to a criminal complaint.

Making ends meet: Vineberg's stepdaughter says he sold drugs to pay his rent when he couldn't find work as a musician

Not involved: Christina Soto says her stepfather did not sell the drugs that Hoffman overdosed on

Tip off: Four people were arrested in apartments at 302 Mott Street in lower Manhattan after police were tipped off by a heroin user

'This case and the charges against Mr Vineberg have absolutely nothing to do with the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman. ... We're hoping the (district attorney) will not use Mr. Vineberg as a scapegoat,' said his lawyer, Edward Kratt, who declined to say whether Vineberg knew Hoffman.

On
 hearing news of his tragic death on Sunday, Soto remember that her 
stepfather said: 'If he would have come to me, I would have told him to 
slow down, and if youâ€™re going to do something, make sure you have 
someone with you.'

Hoffman,
 46, was found dead at his $10,000-a-month West 
Village apartment surrounded by 70 bags of heroin and 20 used syringes.

was charged with felony drug possession following the police swoop

Vineberg was granted bail on February 14 after his February 4 arrest.

His lawyer told the judge that the 300 bags of heroin found in his apartment were for personal use.

Justice Edward McLaughlin said the claim was dubious.

'If he has an incessant, uncontrolled heroin addiction, then lying around with 300 bags of heroin, he would be dead,' McLaughlin said, reported the New York Post.

'If he has no job that produces income and has $1,500 or $1,300 in cash, you draw your own conclusions.'

A group of about 20 musician friends were there to support Vineberg.

Investigators
 have determined that Hoffman made six ATM transactions for a 
total of $1,200 inside a supermarket near his home the day before his 
death, law enforcement officials have said.

Investigators
 are examining a computer and two iPads found at the scene for clues and
 recovered syringes, a charred spoon and various prescription 
medications, including a blood pressure drug and a muscle relaxant, law 
enforcement officials have said.
