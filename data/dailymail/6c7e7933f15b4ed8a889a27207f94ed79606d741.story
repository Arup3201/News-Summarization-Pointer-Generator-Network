They once bonded over their love of junk food but now a mother and daughter have changed their ways and have lost an incredible 24 stone after going under the knife.

Debbie Marchese and Chloe Paul had gastric bypass surgery when they each weighed 28 stone.

The pair knew they had to do something about their weight when carrying out simple tasks became an effort and Chloe, then a size 28, snapped two chairs under her weight.

Half her size: Debbie is a now a size 14, having shed 14 stone...

... meanwhile daughter Debbie is a size 16 and weighs 18 stone. Both had weighed 28 stone

Since having the op which shrinks the size of the stomach, Debbie is a now a size 14, having shed 14 stone, while daughter Chloe is a size 16 and weighs 18st, after losing 10 stone.

Married mother-of-two Debbie, 53, said: 'We joke that we got two-for-one, mother-daughter gastric bypasses.'

Before they changed their lifestyles, 
Debbie and Chloe, 25, used to eat more than 4,000 calories a day in sugar and
carb-heavy food. For breakfast Debbie would munch on buttery 
toast, while Chloe would go without eating. Lunch would be four cheese 
sandwiches with crisps for Debbie, while Chloe would eat cheese 
sandwiches with a Pot Noodle.

Junk food binges: The pair would often gorge on unhealthy snacks

Operation successful: The pair have never felt better since having gastric bypasses

For
dinner, Debbie used to eat a large portion of spaghetti Bolognese and 
Chloe would eat an extra-large portion of curry with rice, bread and 
butter and six chapatis.

Both
women snacked throughout the day on biscuits, cheese and Chloe could 
scoff six Mars ice-cream bars, eight bags of crisps and four cans of 
Coca-Cola in one day.

In 2010, they decided enough was enough fearing they could die young because of their unhealthy eating.

They sought help and Debbie was told she would be able to have a gastric bypass operation on the NHS because she was diabetic.

Food swap: On the left, some of the foods they would eat daily including chocolate, cakes and crisps, and right,  some of the healthy foods they eat now

Meanwhile, Chloe had to pay for the op herself using £10,000 she borrowed through a loan.

Although their operations were nine months apart and took place at different hospitals in Kent, the pair had the same surgeon - Dr Shamsi El-Hasani.

Since having the ops, Debbie and Chloe have swapped cheese and biscuits for fresh fruit and yoghurt, and enjoy smaller portions of healthy meals.

As a result, Debbie has lost half her body weight, shrinking to a size 14.

A month after her bypass surgery, Chloe, already a mum, found she was expecting twins with husband Amit. Since giving birth, she is now a size 16.

As they were: Chloe, left, would struggle doing daily activities with her children, while Debbie would also feel the strain when on grandmother duty

She said: 'I think having the twins stopped me losing as much as I wanted to but I have completely changed my lifestyle for the better. I can play and walk with the kids more than ever.'

Chloe said she is delighted with her and her mother's weightloss and they have no regrets about the surgery. 'We're the dream team! We both feel like our lives have improved so much. Now when we walk into a clothes shop we can try on whatever we want - it's an incredible feeling.'

She added: 'Before, we'd sit in the car park 
after a going to the supermarket and eat an entire salami each, plus 
polish off a whole block of cheese. Now, we eat much less and much better. I'm so proud of my mum, I think she looks amazing. We both look a lot better.'

She also thinks going through the weightloss journey has made them closer.

'Since cutting out the junk food our relationship is stringer than ever. We laugh all the time and now days are spent in the park with the kids, rather than at the kitchen eating.'

New wardrobe: The women show how much they have lost by their clothes which no longer fit
