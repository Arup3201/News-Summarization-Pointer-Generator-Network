'Problem': Former director of BBC News Helen Boaden was aware of a 'deep liberal bias' in the way the Corporation approached the topic of immigration, the report said

The BBC’s ‘deep liberal bias’ prevented it from reporting immigration properly, its former news chief has admitted.

Helen Boaden told a BBC review into the impartiality of its own coverage that it failed to take anti-immigration lobby groups ‘seriously’ when she took the job in 2004, the year Britain threw open its doors to migrants from Eastern Europe.

The report, published yesterday, collected a series of damning comments by current and former corporation employees who accused it of ‘collective blindness’ and ‘fundamental niceness’ over controversial topics such as race and immigration.

But it concluded that the BBC produces an ‘impressive range of opinion’ overall.

Critics said the report would encourage the BBC to continue to ignore concerns over bias.

Tory MP Philip Davies, who sits on the culture, media and sport committee, said: ‘[Helen Boaden’s comments] confirm what most of us have known for many years.

'I don’t want the BBC just to accept this and continue on their way.

'What are they going to do to stop their liberal Left-wing culture?’

Sir Andrew Green, chairman of lobby group Migration Watch, said the review was a ‘lost opportunity’ and ‘skated over’ recent cases of corporation bias.

The 65-page report, produced by former ITV boss Stuart Prebble, a self-confessed ‘liberal progressive’, was called a ‘whitewash’ by Ed West, the author of another recent investigation into BBC impartiality.

'Bias': The BBC was 'slow' to catch up with public opinion on topic including immigration and the UK's membership of the European Union, according to a new report

Mr Prebble’s review, which cost licence 
fee-payers £175,000, criticised the BBC for being ‘slow to reflect the 
weight of concern in the wider community’ about immigration and the 
European Union.

He said the corporation gave too much
 prominence to the opinions of politicians, who were hesitant to discuss
 immigration issues.

But he concluded the overall selection
 of opinion broadcast by the BBC is ‘broad and impressive’, adding: 
‘Only the very unreasonable would argue that  the BBC is not providing a
 suitable breadth of views and opinion on the subject of Europe.’

As part of his eight-month analysis, 
Mr Prebble interviewed 25 senior BBC staff, including Miss Boaden, now 
director of BBC radio.

Debate: The BBC was 'slow to give appropriate prominence' to the growing weight of opinion opposing UK membership of the EU, the report said

He said: ‘[Miss Boaden] accepts that 
when she came into her role in September 2004 there had been a problem 
in the BBC’s coverage of immigration.

She was aware, she told us, of a “deep
 liberal bias” in the way that the BBC approached the topic, and 
specifically that press releases coming from Migration Watch were not 
always taken as seriously as they might have been.’

BBC presenter Steve Hewlett accused 
the corporation of a ‘general corporate sensitivity’ and a ‘collective 
blindness’ over race and immigration.

Former Today programme journalist 
Robin Aitken added: ‘What damages the BBC on a subject like immigration 
is fundamental niceness and being loath to give offence to any part of 
the community.

‘It is a self-censoring idea: “Let’s 
not encourage debate as it might encourage nasty elements in society.” 
It is entirely wrong-headed.’

However, Mr Prebble refused to express
 an opinion on whether the BBC was guilty of liberal bias.

He added: 
‘There is no genuine argument that the presence of one type of 
programming is squeezing out the opportunity to hear an alternative 
point of view.’

He even suggested viewers and listeners should ‘read a book’ if they were unhappy with the BBC.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We are pleased our coverage has been deemed “remarkable” and “impressive”.’

A well-known figure in London media circles, 62-year-old Stuart Prebble was ITV’s chief executive until 2002 when he resigned after the collapse of ITV Digital.He set up the independent programme maker Liberty Bell and his many BBC credits include BBC2 series Grumpy Old Men and, in 2007, a three-part series based on the diaries of former Labour spin doctor Alistair Campbell.

He began his career as a BBC graduate trainee journalist and last year he revealed: ‘I have a long-term affection for the BBC. It’s important for all of us in broadcasting.’

Yesterday Mr Prebble, who now heads StoryVault Films, insisted he is not currently working on any BBC projects. Defending his appointment, BBC Trust member David Liddiment said: ‘Stuart has been very open about his [liberal] perspective. He was a very good person to do this report.’

The review of BBC current affairs likened Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman to a brutal boxer.

It highlighted an episode of Newsnight where Paxman clashed with Respect MP George Galloway.

Author Stuart Prebble said: ‘When George Galloway squared up to Jeremy Paxman after Galloway won the Bradford West by-election, Paxman started raining blows on him from the starting bell, to an extent that I was surprised to find my sympathies going towards the challenger.’

He also said that interviews on Radio 4’s Today, for example by John Humphrys, could be like a fairground prize-fighter taking on an amateur.

‘The result can be excruciatingly entertaining to witness, and no one doubts that both sides need properly to be tested, but it is not always a fair display of the merits of each fighter,’ he said.
