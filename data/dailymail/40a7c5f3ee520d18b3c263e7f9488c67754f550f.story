China is building a new landmark in the northeast of the country that defies the notion that size doesn't matter.

Taking shape in the city of Fushun in Liaoning province is a gigantic steel loop dubbed the Ring of Life.

The 500-foot ring is made of a whopping 3,000 tonnes of steel and will glow at night with a phenomenal 12,000 LED lights.

The landmark, which is equivalent to a 50-storey building, cost nearly Â£10 million and has been designed by the same architect behind the Oriental Pearl TV Tower in Shanghai.

According to Fushun Municipal Government's officials, the iconic structure has been built simply to serve as an viewing platform. Up to four elevators will take visitors to the top.

The developer originally planned to add a platform for visitors to bungee jump off. However, the idea was abandoned because the ring is too high for bungee jumpers.

A local construction bureau official told the Shenyang Evening News that Fushun wanted to have an office tower on the spot of the ring but the town was too small to support it.

The Ring of Life came to fruition after the developer scrapped three other plans.
