A thirst for alcohol among China's middle classes is driving demand in the global spirits market, it has been revealed.

Almost 28billion litres of spirits were drunk globally last year - an increase of 2 per cent - although this was a far smaller rise than 2011, when volumes went up by 7 per cent, figures showed.

The amount of spirits being consumed in domestic markets across the Asia-Pacific region grew by 3 per cent last year - and China now accounts for 38 per cent of all spirits drunk in the world.

Way ahead: Vodka is the most popular of these thanks to its extreme popularity in Russia, where 2billion litres were drunk in 2012 - equivalent to 14 litres for every person in the country

The Chinese national liquor, Baijiu, accounts for almost 100 per cent of all spirits consumed there – and the country is therefore not even in rankings for the best-known globally consumed spirits.

Vodka is the most popular of these thanks to its extreme popularity in Russia, where 2billion litres were drunk in 2012 - equivalent to 14 litres for every person in the country, reported The Economist.

But the growth in Asia last year - almost 450million litres of spirits - was bigger than the size of the entire German market, according to figures from the International Wine & Spirit Research group.

Seven of the top ten growth markets for spirits are from the Asia-Pacific region - and India now accounts for 10 per cent of all spirits drunk globally, the research also found.

Whisky: Mature European markets such as France, Spain, Germany and Italy were among the largest-declining markets, with their falls being attributed to tax increases and struggling economies

Rum split: The largest-growing categories in 2012 all have Asian countries as their top growth markets

'Despite a slowdown in the economic growth of some Asian markets, wealth is still rising and a new generation of consumers emerging'

The largest-growing categories in 2012 all have Asian countries as their top growth markets.

The report from the IWSR said: ‘Despite a slowdown in the economic growth of some Asian markets, wealth is still rising and a new generation of consumers emerging.

‘The IMF has cut its growth rate forecast for China and although the spirits market has slowed, it is still experiencing strong growth, particularly compared with Western markets.’
