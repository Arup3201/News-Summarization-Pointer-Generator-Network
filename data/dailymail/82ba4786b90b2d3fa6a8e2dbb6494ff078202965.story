Three quarters of welfare cheats get away without punishment, official figures show.

Just one in four swindlers face legal action, undermining the Government’s claims that it is cracking down on benefit fraud.

Legal action was ruled out in 35,000 cases last year, with only 9,836 prosecuted by the Department for Work and Pensions and the Crown Prosecution Service.

And of those found guilty of ripping off the benefits system, just 4 per cent were handed a custodial sentence.

Official figures show how just one in four benefits cheats are prosecuted, with more than 35,000 avoiding court

The embarrassing figures emerged after the DWP was criticised by the Whitehall spending watchdog for failing to act on fraud.

The National Audit Office this week refused to sign of the ministry’s accounts for the 24th year in a row after the amount lost to fraudsters rose to £1.2billion.

According to figures released in response to parliamentary questions, just a fraction of people cheating the system ever face the criminal courts.

The size of the frauds has also increased. In 2010-11 there were just over 2,000 cases where more than £10,000 was fraudulently claimed. But in 2011-12 the number leapt to almost 3,000.

In 2011-12, the most recent year for which figures are available, just 403 benefits cheats were jailed while 8,911 were handed a non-custodial sentence.

Labour’s shadow welfare minister Chris Bryant said: ‘I’ve always thought that playing the system was the worst form of crime, because in essence it’s stealing from everybody and in particular from the most vulnerable.

‘It undermines people’s confidence in the whole system, which is why Government should come down heavily where there is real fraud and abuse.’

They are words which have come back to haunt the Prime Minister.

In August 2010, David Cameron delivered a major speech on benefits insisting the coalition would take action to reduce fraud.

He
condemned the Labour government for failing to tacakle the problem and 
suggested firms could be paid a ‘bounty’ for every benefit cheat they 
identify.

Speaking at a public meeting in Manchester, the Prime Minister said he wanted to see an ‘uncompromising’ crackdown on fraud.

He added: 'We're not going to shrug our shoulders and let these people get away with it any longer.

'Cutting benefit fraud is a no-brainer. That's why benefit fraud is the first and the deepest cut we will make.'

But the figures show that since 2010 the amount lost in fraud has not changed at £1.2billion.

However, the DWP said new penalties mean fraudsters can be fined up to £2,000 with without being taken to court.

Officials
can also impose a £50 civil penalty where a claimant gives false 
information about their circumstances which results in an overpayment.

A DWP spokesperson said: ‘We are determined to stop fraudsters who see benefits as a way of lining their pockets.

‘We are giving our investigators the resources to catch these criminals and always push hard for the strongest punishments.

‘We
look to ensure overpayments are repaid even if cases do not end up in 
court, and we have introduced civil penalties to deter claimants from 
making errors in their claims that lead to overpayments.’

Overall fraud and error in the benefits system has risen to a record £110 a second.

The National Audit Office said losses climbed by more than 9 per cent last year to an ‘unacceptable’ £3.5billion.

Benefit fraud rose by £100million to £1.2billion last year compared with 2011/12.

Overpayments due to errors by claimants and officials went up £200million to £2.3billion.

In 2012-13 a total of £1.2billion was 
lost in fraud overpayments, including £800million in benefits handed out
by the DWP and a further £400million lost in payments made by local 
councils.

In 2011-12 the figure was £1.1billion, still markedly up on £800million in 2007-08.

Jobseeker’s
Allowance, Income Support and Pension Credit were most likely to be 
used to con the taxpayer out of money, the NAO said, because ‘they 
require the claimant to supply complete and accurate information in 
order to establish entitlement to benefit’.

The
biggest scam involves claiming benefits as a single person while living
with a partner, or lying about income levels and working cash in hand.

NAO chief Amyas Morse has ‘qualified’ the DWP accounts as a result of fraud and error which remains ‘unacceptably high’.

The accounts of the department and its predecessors have received similar qualified audit opinions since 1988-89.

Mr
Morse said: ‘I am still concerned about the continuing high level of 
fraud and error in benefits expenditure. Issuing an audit qualification 
is a serious matter, and the fact that similar qualifications have 
followed one another over so many years does not lessen that 
seriousness.
