A snake catcher has shared hilarious images of some of the most bizarre places he has discovered the world's deadliest creatures.

For 13 years Richie Gilbert has been removing serpents from unexpected spots such as gyms, wine racks, brothels and even under pillows.

Fearless Mr Gilbert has relocated around 600 snakes across Queensland, Australia, since founding his company Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers 24/7, which operates 24 hours and seven days a week, in February 2014.

A carpet python guards the toilet paper: Mr Gilbert has been bitten more than 100 bites in his lifetime

He has been bitten more than a dozen times this past season alone - with more than 100 bites in his lifetime.

But despite his daring job, Mr Gilbert anticipates turning it into a family business with his five-year-old daughter, Ivory, showing an interest.

'My family have a healthy respect for venomous snakes and while they wouldn't touch them, they certainly do not fear them,' he said.

'My two eldest girls, Zahra and Ivory, absolutely love hearing about my day and will hold non-venomous snakes any chance they get.'

Mr Gilbert deals with creatures varying from carpet snakes to highly venomous Eastern Brown Snakes, the second-most venomous in the world.

He added: 'My mum says I was chasing lizards as soon as I could walk.

'She tells people I caught my first snake, a highly-venomous copperhead, when I was five.

'We were camping in New South Wales and a friend and I came out of the bush with it in a bucket.

A snake cuddled up on a wine rack: 'Most people think a snake will chase you and bite but that couldn't be further from the truth,' Mr Gilbert said

'Most people think a snake will chase you and bite but that couldn't be further from the truth.

'They also think they are slimy but they really just feel like finger nails.'   

But that close encounter with disaster didn't deter the boy from the Sunshine Coast from turning his backyard hobby  into a career as a qualified snake catcher.

'A lot of people think it's a dangerous job but to me, I feel like it's not dangerous at all,' Mr Gilbert told Daily Mail Australia. 

Mr Gilbert was called to a home this season where he found the large carpet python had devoured chickens

'There are people risking their lives everyday - like electricians or people parachuting and jumping out of planes - to me that's dangerous but its all relative to risk management.

'But I've been doing it for a long time and I can't put my finger on what attracted me to them but I have always loved chasing snakes since I was little.

'And I love snakes for different reasons - like the venomous ones give me an adrenaline kick when I catch them.'

Mr Gilbert, who owns the Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers 24/7, has been catching snakes since the age of five

Gilbert's colleague Stuart McKenzie recently removed an eastern brown snake on a job. Mr Gilbert added: 'It's the most beautiful one I've ever seen - it's orange incase you didn't notice!'

'It's been quite busy during the summer season and I've been getting a lot of phone calls and text messages for identification or to attend homes to locate and remove snakes if necessary', he said. 

Despite many years of experience, Mr Gilbert said he has never had any training.

'A lot of people ask me how I've learnt to catch snakes but I can't remember a day where I'm not catching them – I've been doing it for a long time and I guess it was just self-taught.

'Growing up, Steve Irwin played a passion that I had. I remember watching his shows and thinking 'that's what I do too!' and it stirred me on from there.'

Snake catcher Richie Gilbert came to the rescue when he was called to a home on the Sunshine Coast

While Mr Gilbert makes his job sound too easy, he said he has had some of the scariest moments.

'Just recently, I did something really stupid – I crawled underneath a home and it was just two foot off the ground to catch an eastern brown snake.

'Crawling on my tummy, trying to locate it which in hind sight – I shouldn't have done – but when I looked up, it was right above my head, looking at me like 'what are you doing?' so I slowly backed out.

'The owner passed me a pool stick to try and get it out and it dropped to the ground just two metres from my face and looked straight at me in a defence position – it's what they do when they feel threatened and vulnerable. 

Despite many years of experience, Mr Gilbert said he has never had any training and was self-taught

The family Labrador alerted the owners when it found a carpet python in its kennel. The owners taped up the door to trap it inside the kennel until Mr Gilbert arrived to remove it

'It was stupid and dumb – I managed to catch it safely but it wasn't the end of it. The owner's Labrador was coming at me so I had the snake in one hand and trying to scare the dog with my leg – it was crazy.'

After Mr Gilbert catches the reptiles, he releases them back into the wild.

'We try to release them in the same geographical area and I don't like to take them too far away from where they were found. But it has to be a far distance away so they don't come back,' he said.

'But if it's a venomous snake, a lot more thought goes into them and we try to release them far away as possible from residential areas.'

When it doubt about spotting a snake, Mr Gilbert suggests the best thing to do in a situation is move away slowly and try to take a photograph from a safe distance

The avid snake catcher has been catching snakes at a very young age and hasn't stopped since

Mr Gilbert said the most venomous snakes Australians should be aware of at the moment is the eastern brown snakes, which are the second most venomous snakes in the world.

When it doubt about spotting a snake, Gilbert suggests the best thing to do in a situation is move away slowly and try to take a photograph from a safe distance.

'Send it to us and we can identify it for you and if it's venomous or not and whether we need to come out to catch it ourselves and relocate them,' he said.

'If the snake is found inside a home in one of the rooms, it's best to close the room and pop a towel underneath the door and then call us.

'Be smart about it because 90 percent of the time, people who are bitten are often trying to kill it or scare it away.

'All snakes want to do is get away but if it doesn't feel it can escape, it'll strike – so be sensible when you spot them.'
