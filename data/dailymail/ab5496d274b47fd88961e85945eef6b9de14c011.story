School children as young as four have been moved after it was feared rats had invaded classrooms.

Forty reception pupils, aged four and five, had to be moved from St Joseph's Catholic Primary, in Wallasey, Merseyside, after reports of rodents.

Three classrooms had to be closed after staff at the school suspected the pest problem on Tuesday, and informed Wirral Council.

Mother-of-two Kelly Cotton, 23, kept her five-year-old daughter Lexie off school because of the alleged rat problem.

Ms Cotton, from Wallasey, said: 'The whole school needs cleaning inch by inch, not just the ones in question.

'Who’s to say they havnt spread across the whole site?'

Forty children have had to be temporarily relocated from their classroom at St Joseph's Catholic Primary School in Wallasey, Merseyside after the rat scare

'I’m not taking any chances they should be closing the school and having every single room treated.

'Me and plenty of other mums aren't sending our kids back until we’re satisfied it’s clean enough.

'Apparently they knew about the rats before Easter but they’re only doing something about it now.

'They had a terrible OFSTED report last term so this rat scandal will make them look even worse.'

Ms Cotton said that her and 'plenty of other mothers' were keeping their children away from school until they were sure it had been properly cleaned

The 40 pupils have been relocated to a local nursery - while another 20 children affected will be moved to other classrooms in the school.

Wirral Council said the headteacher and staff were making 'every effort to reduce disruption for the children'.

Pest controllers deep cleaned the affected rooms and 'pest-proofing' measures had been put in place, it said.

One parent said: 'My fear is that they could get bitten or catch something.

'I haven't had anything from the school, it's all just playground rumours.

'Some people are saying it's just droppings, others are saying they've seen rats.'

Another parent said: 'The health and safety professionals have been in and cleaned up the whole area.

'They only found three juvenile rats, which I think have come in from a piece of grassland by the school.'It is expected youngsters relocated will not be able to return to their school until early next week.

A Wirral council spokesman said: 'The 
school is being supported by the council's pest control services and the
 health, safety and resilience team to help them to manage the 
situation.'

Headteacher Kathryn Vernon said: 'We are working closely with Wirral Council after evidence of rodents was seen on school premises.

'We are unsure whether there is still a problem as no vermin have been seen since we reported the issue.

'Wirral Council Pest Control have up to this moment found no evidence of rats. However mouse droppings have been identified, so it is important that we investigate properly and act on any advice given. The situation is being kept under review.

'Our key priority is the well-being and education of our children so we have temporarily relocated some classes to make sure they can continue their lessons, accompanied by their usual teachers.'
