Social media surrounding the Trayvon Martin case has reached a point of near-hysteria – causing a fake Will Smith tweet to be reposed thousands of times.

The alleged tweet reads: ‘WE live in America where a girl that threw flour on Kim Kardashian was arrested on site. But the man who KILLED Trayvon Martin is still free.’

In addition, director Spike Lee has been accused of accelerating racial tensions as he tweeted what he thought was the address of George Zimmerman.

The address, it was later discovered, was instead for an unrelated person in the Sanford, Florida area.

The fake Will Smith account, @RealWillSmith, in fact belongs to a white man from Nashville, Tennessee, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

Though the actor Will Smith does not have a publicly-identified Twitter account, several celebrities jumped on the re-tweeting bandwagon, including Rosie O’Donnell, Spike Lee, and Omarosa.

The flour bombing incident to which the fake Smith was referring was at the London West Hollywood Hotel last week.

Kardashian was plastered with flour while promoting her new fragrance, True Reflection.

Though the woman was apparently pulling a dusty prank, she was arrested at the scene; Kardashian said she will be pressing charges.

Lee, meanwhile, is facing considerable backlash for the retweeting of the alleged whereabouts of Zimmerman, who has an outstanding $10,000 bounty on him by the New Black Panthers.

Comedian and actor Will Ferrell has also been dragged into the confusion.

A person with the Twitter handle @RealWillFerrell posted about a T-shirt fund.

The tweet read: ‘RIP Trayvon Martin… For every R-T this tweet gets, $1 will be donated to the #TrayvonMartin Foundation, which helps counteract racism.’

However, there is of yet no Trayvon Martin Foundation. Furthermore, Ferrell’s rep confirmed to the Hollywood Reporter that the tweet was a hoax.

Lee’s rep was unavailable for comment.
