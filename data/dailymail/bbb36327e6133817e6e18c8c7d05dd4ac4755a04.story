One individual was arrested after an officer was stabbed in the hand with scissors. The policeman was taken to Bellevue Hospital and believed to be in a stable condition.

Zuccotti Park hasn't been occupied since police cleared it on November 15 in an early morning raid.  The movement escalated at 8pm last night, when around 100 protesters entered the park and erected a small tent.

The New York Times reported: 'By about 10.30 pm, there were more than 300 people inside... One man carried a big white placard that read - New Years Revolution.'

Shortly before midnight, OWS protesters announced on Twitter that they had reclaimed the park and unfurled a huge hand-painted banner reading 'OCCUPY WALL STREET'.

They tweeted: 'Barricades being torn down at liberty [Zuccotti] park...Happy new years!!'

As the new year was welcomed around the city, demonstrators chanted: 'Whose year? Our year.'

On Occupy Wall Street's official website it stated: '2011 was an amazing awakening. Let's start 2012 off right! Come 
celebrate with thousands of other members of the 99%, at our park and in
the streets, as we make our special New Years Revolution together.'

Police in riot gear entered the park at 1.30am  where 150 people remained and arrested five demonstrators. Authorities closed the park until 9am this morning.

Activists had been camped out in Zuccotti Park since September 17 to protest against the unjust distribution of wealth in the U.S. and 
the excessive influence of big business on government.

The movement spread to other U.S. cities including Los Angeles and Portland as well as Australia, Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain, Ireland 
and Portugal.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg ordered the protest to be cleared in November because health and safety conditions had become 'intolerable' in the crowded plaza.

One million revellers filled Times Square to welcome in the new year last night amid tight security. More than 1,500 members of the NYPD were patrolling the massive 17-block party to ensure everyone’s safety. They also used more than 3,000 cameras and numerous check-points with bag inspections. Alcohol was banned from the event.
