Margaret Parsons, 58, launched at her husband Gordon four times with a knife after  drinking

A man who was stabbed by his wife in the chest claims she has actually saved his life - because medics later discovered he had a serious liver disease.

Margaret Parsons, 48, launched at her husband Gordon four times with a knife after a heavy drinking session at their home in Launceston, Cornwall.

Police found Mr Parsons, 47, bleeding from a knife wound to his chest - while his wife slept in their bedroom. 

Parsons pleaded guilty to wounding her husband at Truro Crown Court and was jailed for 16 months. 

Prosecutor Philip Lee said that after an argument, Parsons went to the living room with a kitchen knife and told her husband she would 'cut his throat'. 

She then struck out with the knife, catching him in the chin, and then stabbing him in the chest.

But despite the attack, Mr Parsons told the court he still loved his wife - and wanted her back on her release from prison. 

Miss Jo Martin, defending,told the court: 'She in effect saved his life because when he was taken into hospital they discovered the seriousness of his liver disease and he is now getting treatment for it.'

The Parsons had been married for about four years and lived together in Launceston but had a volatile relationship, fuelled by drink, it was said.

The court heard more than a dozen incidents had been reported to police, with heavy drinking being a major factor in the trouble.

Prosecutor Philip Lee said a neighbour was woken after hearing 'a blood curdling scream which continued for 30 minutes'.

Sentencing Parsons, of Launceston, to 16 months in prison, Judge Christopher Harvey Clark, QC, said she had thrust the knife at her husband three or four times and that the thrust to the chest could have killed him. 

'Fortunately it did not and fortunately it did not cause major injury to him,' he added.
