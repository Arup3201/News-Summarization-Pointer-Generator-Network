Ukrainian football club Shakhtar Donetsk have seen their business headquarters over-run by 'armed men', the club announced on Wednesday.

Pro-Russian insurgents in eastern Ukraine have caused instability in the region, leading to conflict.

Russian president Vladimir Putin has urged the soldiers to stop their advance, while also calling for Ukraine to rein back its troops in the region.

Not at home: Shakhtar have been forced to leave their stadium and move to Kiev and Lviv 

However, Shakhtar reported their business address in central Donetsk had been targeted.

It was not clear in Shakhtar's statement to which side of the conflict those involved belonged.

The club, winners of the Ukrainian league in each of the last five years, announced on their website: 'FC Shakhtar's office at 86a Artema St in Donetsk was occupied by armed men. Circumstances of the incident are being investigated.' 

Destruction: The main building at the Shakhtar training base was destroyed by shelling
