Venue: Estadio Castelao, Fortaleza

Kick-off: 8pm (4pm, Brazil time)

TV coverage: ITV1, from 8.30pm

Odds: Uruguay 1/2, Draw 11/4, Costa Rica 7/1

Referee: Felix Brych, Germany

Support: Uruguay fans cheers on their team ahead of World Cup opener between Brazil and Croatia

Managers:

Oscar Tabarez (Uruguay) Jorge Luis Pinto (Colombia)

Key clash: Edinson Cavani v Junior Diaz

The likely absence of Luis Suarez leaves Cavani as Uruguay’s main man and he has shown at PSG this season how he revels in that role. Diaz is strong in the air and contributes with more than his fair share of blocks at the back for Costa Rica and will aim to frustrate the £55million man.

Battle: Edinson Cavani (left) will come up against Junior Diaz on Saturday

One to watch: Christian Bolanos (Costa Rica)

Speedy right winger Bolanos will be looking to test the Uruguayans’ lack of pace at the back and will be key to teeing up Marco Urena on the break as Costa Rica look to cause an upset. Costa Rica’s gameplan will be all about counter-attacking quickly and Bolanos is key to that.

Head-to-head record:
