Lewis Hamilton has said he will not cheat his way to the Formula One title in Abu Dhabi on Sunday.

The Mercedes driver, who is aiming to win his second world title ahead of fierce rival Nico Rosberg, promised not to sully the season finale with a scurrilous act.

Asked if he would stage a crash, he said: ‘Have I crashed all year? I’m pretty good at what I do. Why would I crash?’

The pair will have the freedom to race without orders from Mercedes. So, with a 17-point lead over Rosberg, Hamilton would potentially benefit if he took him out.

But he said of crashing: ‘That’s not me. I want to win by winning. I’ve never raced that way.’

Hamilton completed a practice double on Friday as his bid to win a second Formula One world championship got off to the best-possible start. 

Lewis Hamilton topped the timesheets in both practice sessions at the Yas Marina Circuit on Friday 

Hamilton is 17 points ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg with just one race of the season remaining 

1. Lewis Hamilton - 334 points 

2. Nico Rosberg - 317 points 

Lewis Hamilton will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix , even if Nico Rosberg wins the race.

If the final race was a ‘normal’ race with 25 points for the winner, rather than the double points on offer, Hamilton would be able to claim his second drivers’ title with a sixth-place finish.

After topping the timesheets in the opening session, Hamilton was against fastest under the lights in Abu Dhabi.

Hamilton was only 0.083 seconds ahead of title rival Nico Rosberg, who knows he must win this weekend to stand any chance of snatching the title from his Mercedes team-mate.  

'I got the whole session which was great, but there is still time to find,' said Hamilton. 

'It's the same programme as each weekend and we are just chipping away at it. The team has done an awesome job. This is the best car I have had to drive round here. 

'I am going to do the best I can and so far I am making the right steps.'

A top-two finish, regardless of the controversial double points on offer this weekend, will guarantee Hamilton the title.

Given Mercedes have scored one-twos in the last six races it would appear all that can stop Hamilton is either an accident or technical issue.

In practice, Hamilton did all that was asked with  Rosberg naturally second best, as not for the first time this campaign no-one could hold a candle to the dominant duo.

At the conclusion of the first 90-minute session, in particular, the margin from Hamilton to Ferrari's Fernando Alonso in third was a staggering 1.7secs following soft-compound tyre runs.

Even McLaren's Jenson Button, potentially competing in the last race of his 15-season career as his future remains in limbo with McLaren not deciding on their driver line-up until after December 1, found the situation amusing.

With his car in the garage due to a technical fault, watching from the sidelines, Button tweeted: 'Great to see @MercedesAMGF1 have got a lot of competition here in Abu Dhabi!! 1.7second gap!'

With Pirelli's supersoft rubber given an outing in the second session the margin of dominance was at least narrowed.

Hamilton finished a slender 0.083secs clear of Rosberg, with Kevin Magnussen in his McLaren the best of the rest at nearly three quarters of a second off the pace.

Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel, now confirmed as a Ferrari driver for next season, and Williams' Valtteri Bottas, also managed to finish within a second of Hamilton.

Bottas and team-mate Felipe Massa had earlier sat out most of FP1 after the sidepod bodywork on the Finn's car had ripped off early in the session, whilst that on the Brazilian's car was found to be loose.

Bottas and Massa made up for lost time in FP2, with each completing 34 laps, although the latter was only 10th and 1.445secs off the pace.

In between the pair were Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, Kimi Raikkonen in his Ferrari, with Jenson Button eighth at least, albeit late on track given his earlier woes and managing only 23 laps, with Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat ninth.

For Alonso, from the relative high of third, the departing star who will return to McLaren for next season, slumped to the low of 20th and last without a time to his name.

Due to an electrical problem with his car, Alonso was forced to pull up in front of the Yas Viceroy hotel that straddles the circuit.

Ahead of him were the Caterham duo of Kamui Kobayashi and debutant Will Stevens in 18th and 19th respectively, the latter nearly five seconds behind fellow Briton Hamilton.

The Leafield-based team are back on the grid after being allowed to miss the last two races due to falling into administration.

With the team in the shop window, 23-year-old Essex racer Stevens had to wait until 15 minutes from the end of FP1 before finally savouring his first taste of F1 after encountering technical issues.

FP2 was more productive as he also completed 34 laps, and despite finishing 1.6secs behind team-mate Kobayashi, can at least be relatively satisfied with his first day as a F1 driver.
