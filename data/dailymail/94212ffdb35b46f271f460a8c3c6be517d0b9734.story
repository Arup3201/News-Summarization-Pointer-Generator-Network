Wearing glossy lipstick and sporting glamorous wigs, they engage in banter with Ant and Dec about the size of Kim Kardashian’s bottom and ‘boobs’.

It’s a typically risqué moment for ITV’s Loose Women – yet to the horror of watching parents, these panellists are just five and six years old.

The four girls had been taken out of school to appear on the flagship day-time show in a moment that has been accused of humiliating and objectifying the children.

Wearing make-up, the four girls aged between five and six years old were dressed as mini versions of the Loose Women for the interview on Saturday Night Takeaway

Wearing make-up, they were dressed as ‘little women’ for the interview with the Geordie comics, who famously use mini versions of themselves to interview guests on Saturday Night Takeaway.

During the Friday feature, seen by around one million viewers and dubbed ‘little women quiz big boys’, the children – dressed to resemble the show’s regular presenters – read out scripted questions they appeared embarrassed to ask, with one child too nervous to even speak. 

One of them was required to ask the I’m A Celebrity duo about their on-stage encounter with Kim Kardashian at the Brits last week. The girl, who appeared not to understand the sexualised nature of the question, asked: ‘How big is her bum?’

‘That was the biggest topic of conversation,’ Ant joked, adding: ‘Is it real, is it implants? It’s fascinating. It’s because she’s so thin in the waist and her legs are thin.’

Between roars of laughter, Dec quipped in front of the children: ‘To be honest, I didn’t look. I was too busy looking at her boobs.’

Last night, Camila Batmanghelidjh, chief executive of charity Kids Company, said the children had been exploited for ratings and turned into objects, adding: ‘For the children it would have been a difficult experience, even though they may have appeared to have gone along with it.

‘In effect, it’s turning the kids into objects in order to deliver a joke.

‘It is an adult joke and the children are being used to deliver something which is essentially adult humour.

‘It’s poor judgment to place the children in that kind of environment in front of such a wide audience. In the world of children, body scrutiny has become a big problem. Children are very coy about these things.

During the Friday feature dubbed ‘little women quiz big boys’, the children – dressed to resemble the show’s regular presenters – read out scripted questions including one girl who spoke to the duo about their on-stage encounter with Kim Kardashian at the Brits last week and asked: ‘How big is her bum?’

But the presenters have come under

‘They find it very difficult and they struggle to even go there. I am surprised no one thought this through properly.’

And broadcaster and psychologist Oliver James said: ‘A commentary about the desirability of a woman’s body is not appropriate in front of children.’ Their comments were echoed by angry viewers, who took to the show’s Facebook page to criticise the stunt. Aimee Phillips wrote: ‘Shouldn’t they be in school? Us parents get fined if our kids are off school. SHOCKING.’

But one of the children’s parents, Katie Bee, hit back, writing: ‘My daughter is still very much a “child”. She loved it and is already asking when she can next go on TV.’

An ITV insider said: ‘Ant and Dec weren’t aware of the questions before they came on and everyone on set, including the children, had a great time.’

A Loose Women spokeswoman said that no complaints had been received, adding: ‘The children were actors and were given permission by their schools.

‘Each child was accompanied by a parent or guardian. The children and their parents or guardians were happy with the questions, which were agreed in advance.’
