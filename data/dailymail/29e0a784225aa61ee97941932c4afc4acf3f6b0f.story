Mascara is the most important item in our makeup bags, followed by eyeliner

Even if you go for high street names rather than high-end designer brands, the cost of your average basic make-up bag still adds to nearly £100.

According to a new study, the typical woman’s ‘everyday’ makeup bag in the UK contains 14 items; with mascara, eye liner and concealer the most prevalent products, and the most common brand names being Rimmel, Maybeline and Clinique.

The research also revealed that the average makeup bag contains items worth approximately £93.32 in total.

The study polled 2,104 adult women from around the UK, and found the typical number of items that women keep in their ‘everyday’ makeup bag was 14.

Respondents were  asked to name the brands that could currently be found in their makeup bag, which revealed the following top ten most popular appearing in makeup bags across the UK, with Rimmel leading the way with 42 per cent, followed by Maybelline (39 per cent) and Clinique (38 per cent).

The study then asked those taking part, ‘How much do you think the makeup in your ‘everyday’ makeup bag is collectively worth?’ which revealed the average response to be £93.32, with over half of women (52 per cent) saying they replenished their collection with new products every three weeks.  

Revealing just how much women rely psychologically on their makeup to give them confidence, 28 per cent of women said they would ‘never’ go out without their makeup with them, and just 19 per cent said they  ‘frequently’ did so.

The research also revealed that the average makeup bag contains items worth approximately £93.32 in total

1. Mascara – 74%

2. Eyeliner – 71%

3. Concealer – 66%

4. Blusher – 63%

5. Lip gloss/balm – 61%

6. Foundation – 58%

7. Lipstick – 57%

8. Bronzer – 48%

9. Eyeshadow– 43%

10.Highlighter/ Under-eye Pen – 39%

1. Rimmel – 42%

2. Maybeline – 39%

3. Clinique – 38%

4. Bobby Brown – 33%

5. L’Oreal – 31%

6. Max Factor – 27%

7. Revlon – 25%

8. Benefit– 22%

9. Urban Decay – 17%

10. Lancôme- 17%

Matthew Wood of vouchercloud, who conducted the study, said: ‘It does seem that there’s an element of uniformity though according to our poll. Some things are clearly regarded as more essential than others.

‘The collective value is also a bit of an eye opener. Although individual items may seem inexpensive, it appears that the total soon adds up once you put them all together.

‘Looking good doesn’t come cheap it would seem, but we always encourage people to look for makeup discounts wherever possible as there are always deals to be had.’

However, if you think the average makeup bag is costly, the value of the entire handbag will leave you gasping.

A woman’s ideal bag, together with its long list of essential contents, will set her back precisely £1,209.99, according to an analysis by John Lewis done earlier this year.
