The spectacular holiday home of Lord Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Scout movement, has been put up for sale at £4million.

The Victorian mansion, on the edge of Poole Harbour, Dorset, is a stone's throw from Brownsea Island, the location of the first Scout camp in 1907.

Project workers have offered prospective buyers a number of redevelop ideas for the three-storey house, which is set in two acres of grounds and is itself 10,000 sq ft.

Developers now want to return the mansion to its former glory and beyond as they bid to sell it. This is a computer-generated image of how they want the house to look

Known as Grey Rigg Manor, the house boasts five bedrooms, five en-suites and dressing rooms, and guest accommodation with two further bedrooms and separate living quarters.

There is also an open-air squash court and stables as well as a living room, drawing room, dining room, games room, snug, boot room and powder room.

The property was owned by Lord Baden-Powell's future wife, Lady Olave Soames, but the couple hadn't met when he formed the movement.

The pair married in 1912, after they 
met on an ocean liner to New York, in a low-key ceremony two miles from 
Grey Rigg Manor at St Peter's Church, Poole.

Lord Baden-Powell often returned to the mansion to visit the parents of Lady Olave, who was 30 years his junior.

This is the house from the outside as it currently stands. Developers have planned a number of changes to both the inside and outside of the house

Project workers are offering the house in its current state, but the brochure suggests a number of changes that can be made to it

The Dorest mansion, built in 1870, is already home to a number of features, including an open-air squash court and a swimming pool

Developers have now drawn up plans to turn the house's outbuildings into a six-car garage and extra accommodation.

They have also planned to build a deluxe spa, sauna, swimming pool, bar, cinema room, and jacuzzi.

Mike
Jones, developer and project manager, from Lloyd's, said: 'Lady Olave's mother and 
father were a wealthy family and they owned the property as a seaside 
home.

'It was one of their homes and they would visit as a family and enjoy it as a place to be near the beach

'It
sits in grounds of around two acres and has beautiful gardens.

'Currently outside there are stables and a squash court, Lady Olave used 
to enjoy playing squash.'

Mr Jones added: 'It was built around the 1870s and is an absolutely beautiful property.

'Potential buyers may want to have different features so we have suggested things in our brochure that could be added on.

'These include things like a car emporium with accommodation on top, an orangery, and swimming pool.'

Robert
Baden-Powell launched the Scouting movement with his book 'Scouting for
Boys' that was intended to be a training manual used by the army.

Instead,
the ideas were rewritten for children and used to teach youngsters 
about observation and deduction and were put to the test at the first 
Brownsea Island camp.
