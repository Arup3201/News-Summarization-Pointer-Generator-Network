Chauffeur David Matthew was awarded £600 after refusing to pay the extra charges brought by Virgin Mobile 

A man has been awarded £600 by a phone company which wrongly charged him for sending text messages which were 'too long'.

David Matthew, 44, was baffled when he started being billed for picture messages by his provider Virgin Mobile. 

The chauffeur from Durrington, West Sussex, - who depends on texting his clients to inform them of price changes - refused to pay the bills but had his service cut by the company, causing him to lose business. 

Virgin Mobile charged Mr Matthew 40p every time he sent a text message longer than 160 characters, claiming they were picture messages despite the man's unlimited texts tariff.

'I refused to pay the bills because I shouldn’t have been charged,' he said. 

'I was getting charged for sending picture messages, but I never sent them.

'Virgin then cut my phone off and I lost custom.

'I’m a chauffeur. I often text all my clients letting them know pricing changes, which can be quite lengthy texts.

After filing a complaint, a judge at Worthing County Court ruled in Mr Matthews' favour, adding that he should have been allowed to send long text messages.

Virgin Mobile were ordered to pay him £610, which included £90 in loss of earnings compensation. 

'Finally this is all over, hopefully I can get on with recovering my business,' the chauffeur added.

A Virgin Media spokeswoman blamed David’s phone for the blunder.

She said: 'There is no limit to the number of text messages on our unlimited tariffs.

'160 characters is the universal standard length for text messages, yet some handsets automatically convert much longer texts into multimedia messages.

'This was explained to Mr Matthew on several occasions and goodwill gestures given, but we’re sorry he felt this was not explained to him when he took out his contract.' 

Mr Matthew has since left Virgin Mobile. 

Last month a father was hit with a £1,792 bill after his 10-year-old daughter downloaded 28 hours of videos on how to make loom bands.

Trinity's father, Philip, said he was stunned to see he had been charged £1,411. He then phoned Vodafone to contest the amount and cancel his contract but was dealt a double blow when they slapped an extra £381 cancellation fee on top

But her father, Philip, 35, was unaware his daughter had instead been using Vodafone's premium rates for the internet in order to access YouTube videos. 

Trinity said: 'I used to love watching the tutorial videos but now I know it cost my dad £1,792 I have had to stop watching them - it's made me very sad.' 

Also in October, a woman was handed a £12,500 bill after accidentally using her phone to download repeats of sitcom My Family while on holiday in Turkey.

Patricia Al, 23, from Chelsea, London, was hit with the huge bill after downloading just two episodes of the BBC comedy on her O2 phone.

She was using her hotel's Wi-Fi to download the series from iTunes onto her laptop, but the connection cut out and her phone - which was hooked up to her computer - took over the download.

The phone giant has since reduced her bill by £6,644.97, with Ms Al's father stepping in to pay off the rest.
