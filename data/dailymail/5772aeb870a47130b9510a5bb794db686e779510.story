Former two-time World Player of the Year Ronaldinho sold himself short by lacking professionalism, according to the manager who offloaded him to Mexican side Queretaro last month.

Levir Culpi suggested that although the playmaker helped Atletico Mineiro to their first Copa Libertadores title last year, the Braizilian star could have done more.

'It's a shame he doesn't want to pay the price of being a professional athlete because he has done it all,' Culpi said in an interview with local newspaper Estado de Minas on Monday.

The World Cup winning star has now moved to Mexico to join Queretaro after a poor season in Brazil

'I can tell you that big stars such as Kaka help themselves. It's all about professionalism.'

Ronaldinho, 34, was FIFA's World Player of the Year in 2004 and 2005 and won almost every honour possible at Barcelona before returning to Brazil with Atletico.

He sparkled there at first but was disappointing this year.

Ronaldinho has 'has done it all' says Culpi, including winning the Ballon D'or and Champions League

Ronaldinho helped Culpi to Atletico's first Copa Libertadores win in 2013, and 'should be well remembered'

Culpi, who took over earlier this year, balanced his comments with some praise for the former Gremio and Flamengo playmaker.

'Ronaldinho played a better role here than he did in many other places,' he said. 'He left a mark and should be well remembered.'
