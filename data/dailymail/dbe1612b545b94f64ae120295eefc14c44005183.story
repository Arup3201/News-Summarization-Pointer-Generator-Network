Just two days after Tim Cook was accidentally outed on live TV, the Apple CEO showed up to San Francisco's 44th annual Gay Pride Parade to cheer on the crowds and pose for photos with his beaming employees.

Thousands of Apple workers showed up for the event on Sunday wearing special Apple Pride t-shirts, but Cook's appearance came as a surprise.

'Congrats to 5000 Apple employees/families who attended today’s Pride parade,' Cook would later tweet. 'Inclusion inspires innovation.'

Nod and a wink? Apple CEO Tim Cook surprised many when he showed up to San Francisco's gay pride parade to cheer on his 5,000 employees who participated on Sunday

Pride: Like the employees and their family members who attended, Cook donned a special Apple Pride t-shirt that featured a rainbow-hued rendering of their logo

Outed? Apple recently came out against an Arizona bill that would permit businesses to refuse service on religious grounds, a measure that critics said could allow discrimination against gay people and Cook himself has been outspoken about gay rights but he's never publicly addressed his own sexual preference

Cook did not march in the parade itself, but many of the selfies he was sure to take with many of his employees quickly showed up on social media.

Thousands of Apple employees donned specially designed T shirts at the festival and marched in unison. This year's turnout was largest in the company's history, several Apple employees told Reuters.

Apple has a long history of supporting the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. The company recently came out against an Arizona bill that would permit businesses to refuse service on religious grounds, a measure that critics said could allow discrimination against gay people.

Silicon Valley Pride: Apple's 5,000 marchers weren't alone in representing Silicon Valley's biggest companies at the pride festivities. Also in attendance were employees from Google and Facebook

'Congrats': Cook did not personally march but did send well-wishes to those who did

In an unusual step for the sometimes secretive Apple, the company has spoken out about its support for the Pride festival. To help attendees navigate the packed event, the company set up a dedicated LGBT station on iTunes Radio and featured several apps on its App Store, including the Find My Friends app. Company employees also handed out iTunes gift cards to bystanders.

'Apple believes equality and diversity make us stronger, and we're proud to support our employees and their friends and families in this weekend's celebration,' Apple spokeswoman Michaela Wilkinson said.

Fellow tech firms Google Inc and Facebook also spent several days planning their festival debuts. Hundreds of employees showed up at this year's parade. 

Faux pas: Simon Hobbs commented that Apple CEO Tim Cook is openly gay - something that has never been confirmed nor denied by Cook

Crickets: Hobbs's comment was met with dead silence from the other panelists before Jim Stewart (far left), shaking his head, said that Cook is not openly gay

It was a panelist
 on a CNBC current affairs show accidentally outed Cook 
live on-air, to the embarrassment of his co-hosts.

Simon
 Hobbs was one of several co-hosts when New York Times columnist Jim 
Stewart appeared on CNBC's Friday edition of Squawk on the Street to 
talk about an article he's written that explores the dearth of openly 
gay CEOs.

Speaking
 about how former CEO of BP Lord Browne became the first person at a 
Fortune 500 company to publicly acknowledge that he is gay, Stewart said
 there's a 'corporate culture that prevents powerful gay men from going 
public.'

'You’d think CEOs especially are measured by objective criteria, financial performance,' Stewart said.

He went on to say that he had contacted a number of CEOs for a comment  for his story and received a 'very cool reception'.

Then co-host Simon Hobbs piped up, saying, 'I think Tim Cook is fairly open about the fact he’s gay at the head of Apple, isn’t he?'

Speculation: Despite his sexuality being the subject of much speculation in the tech industry, Apple CEO Tim Cook has never confirmed that he is gay

For a moment, a deafening silence filled the studio as the hosts look awkwardly from one to the other before Stewart, shaking his head in disapproval, responds with a succinct, 'No.'

Hobbs tried to recover, 'Oh, dear, was that an error? I thought he was open about it.'

The panel mentioned a recent New York Times article that all but outed the CEO, but Stewart declined to comment.

'I don’t want to comment about anybody who might or might not be. I’m not going to out anybody,' he said.

Despite much speculation about his sexuality, Cook has never commented about whether or not he is gay.

He's been an advocate for the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, which would make it illegal for employers to fire staff based on their sexual orientation, and mentioned in a speech he gave last year that he has been discriminated against.

'Since these early days, I have seen and have experienced many types of discrimination and all of them were rooted in the fear of people that were different than the majority,' he said.
