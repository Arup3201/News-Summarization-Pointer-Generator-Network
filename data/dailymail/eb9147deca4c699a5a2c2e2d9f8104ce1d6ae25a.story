Jos Buttler might not be on Nasser Hussain’s Christmas card list any longer. The England wicketkeeper made Sportsmail’s columnist look like Simpsons character Mr Burns in a sketch he drew for charity.

Buttler, Sam Robson, Steven Finn and their England colleagues produced portraits of the cricketing media.

Robson took a traditional approach for his attempt at Shane Warne, while Finn made reference to Sportsmail columnist David Lloyd’s other passion — Accrington Stanley FC.

The sketches will be sold on eBay for the Cricket United charity initiative.
