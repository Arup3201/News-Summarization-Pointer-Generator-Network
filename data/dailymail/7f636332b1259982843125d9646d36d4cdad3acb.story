Steven Gerrard's strike in Tuesday night's win against Leicester silenced his critics - and moved him ahead of Ian Wright in the all-time Premier League goal charts in the process.

The Liverpool skipper's 114th top-flight goal in the 3-1 victory at the King Power Stadium moved him up to 16th in the list. 

However, Gerrard has his work cut out to catch Dwight Yorke, who has a nine-goal cushion on the former England midfielder.

Gerrard watches on as his strike finds the back of the net to put Liverpool 2-1 up

1) Alan Shearer - 260

2) Andy Cole - 187

3) Wayne Rooney - 178

4) Thierry Henry - 175

5) Frank Lampard - 174 

With the scores locked at 1-1, the 34-year-old fired Brendan Rodgers' side ahead with his first goal from open play for more than 18 months.

Gerrard's current deal at Anfield expires at the end of the season and he has yet to agree an extension.

The one-club man remained tight-lipped about his future when quizzed by reporters on Tuesday.

He told BT Sport: 'There's nothing to say on the contract.

'When there is, the fans have known me long enough, I'll come out and I'll say what I need to say.

'I think the last three performances have been superb. We need to keep trying to improve on that.

'The reason I don't want to answer your question tonight is because it's not about me it's about a great team performance and a great three points. That's what the headline should be.'
