A British worker and two Americans shot dead yesterday when an Afgan policeman opened fire at a training centre.

The gunman was wearing an Afghan national security force uniform when he blasted the three westerners.

The British contractor was killed after the rampage in western Afghanistan against the US-led military coalition, a Nato spokesman said. The two American workers also died.

The official said the matter is being investigated but disclosed few other details.

A British civilian contractor was later named as father-of-two Dave Chamberlain from Kent.

No information about the American civilians has been released.

Nato also said that it killed a number of insurgents with an airstrike in the Mohammad Agha district of eastern Logar province but would not provide further details.

Afghan officials reported that four civilians died on Sunday when hundreds of shells and rockets were fired from neighbouring Pakistan.

The artillery shells hit homes along frontier areas from which insurgents have in the past staged cross-border attacks, according to the report.

A spokesman for the governor of eastern Wardak 
province said insurgents had kidnapped five Afghan men working a base 
jointly operated by Afghan and NATO forces and killed them.

Spokesman 
Shahidullah Shahid said their bodies were discovered early Sunday.

The artillery shells hit homes along frontier areas from which insurgents have in the past staged cross-border attacks.

Five NATO service members have been killed in roadside bombings over the past two days.

There is little or no Afghan or NATO military presence in the area 
and large swaths of the region are controlled by insurgent groups. The 
information could not be independently verified because the area is 
largely off-limits to reporters.

The Afghan government has not openly blamed the Pakistani military 
for the artillery barrage, which reportedly hit districts in the eastern
provinces of Nuristan and Kunar.

Both are considered insurgent hotbeds,
and militants allied with both the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban 
regularly cross the mountainous border in both directions.

President Hamid Karzai discussed artillery fire coming from Pakistan 
at a weekly meeting of his national security council, a statement said. 
It added that Karzai ordered an in-depth investigation into the 
attacks.

The cross-border attacks were discussed in Kabul last week during an 
official visit by Pakistan's new Prime Minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf and 
British Prime Minister David Cameron.

Cameron, Ashraf and Karzai jointly called for a common stand against 
insurgents operating in the lawless border areas. Ashraf complained at a
news conference about attacks against Pakistan originating in Kunar.

Kabul's Foreign Ministry spokesman Janan Mosazai said: 'The rocket 
attacks in the eastern provinces of Afghanistan are not acceptable to 
us, and we are strongly condemning these attacks.

'We believe that the 
continuation of such rocket attacks will have a negative impact on the 
friendly relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan.'

All five of the NATO service members were killed in roadside bomb 
attacks – one Saturday in the east, and on Sunday, two in the east and 
two in the south. NATO provided no further details on the incidents or 
the nationalities of the troops.

The deaths bring the number of foreign forces killed in July to 32, and a total of 247 so far this year.

NATO also said that it killed a number of insurgents with an 
airstrike in the Mohammad Agha district of eastern Logar province. It 
did not provide further details.

Fighting in eastern Afghanistan has been raging since spring as NATO tries to clear the area of insurgents.

Afghan security forces or militants dressed in their uniforms have 
been killing a rising number of coalition forces, but they have not been
specifically targeting contractors working for the coalition.

So far 
this year, 26 foreign troops have been killed in this type of attacks.
