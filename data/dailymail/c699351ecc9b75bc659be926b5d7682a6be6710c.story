Nine members of staff at Heathrow Airport have been arrested on suspicion of stealing items from lost property, police have confirmed.

The suspects, six men and three women, are accused of being involved in 43 separate thefts, between May and September this year.

Busy: Heathrow dealt with around 70 million passengers last year making its lost property department, above, one of the busiest in the world

Aged between 24 and 63, they were 
arrested by officers from the Metropolitan Police Service’s aviation 
security command at the west London airport and at residential 
properties.

They have all been suspended and are currently being held custody.

A spokesman for the airport, which handled 70 million passengers last year, said: 'Heathrow Airport recently contacted the Metropolitan Police to ask them to investigate a report of the possible theft of items from airport lost property.

'Following an investigation, the police have today arrested nine Heathrow employees. 

'The employees in question have been suspended while the police complete their investigation.

'We take any report of criminal behaviour seriously at Heathrow and will be taking appropriate action if there is a case to answer.'

Detained: The suspects were arrested at the airport, above, and at their homes after a Met police investigation

Police said searches are under way at a number of locations.

Superintendent Martin Hendy said: 'Police at Heathrow work together with our partners at the airport to ensure that any allegations of criminal activity are robustly investigated to ensure the travelling public and staff at the airport enjoy a safe and secure environment.

'Today’s arrests support that commitment.'
