A now-retired Super Bowl-winning NFL running back went on a Twitter tirade on Saturday after openly gay 2014 draft pick Michael Sam kissed his boyfriend on television.

Derrick Ward, 33, who was a member of the New York Giants Super Bowl XLII-winning team, didn't hide his disdain for ESPN's decision to air Sam's smooch with boyfriend Vito Cammisano after learning he would become a St. Louis Ram.

'Man U got little kids lookin at the draft,' Ward complained. 'I can't believe ESPN even allowed that to happen.'

Outrage: Derrick Ward, once a running back for the Houston Texans and New England Patriots, took to Twitter Saturday to complain about the kiss shared between NFL draftee Michael Sam and his boyfriend on Saturday

PG13? Ward initially complained that the kiss should not have been aired on TV, where children could see it

While Ward's complaint began with him chastising the sports network on which the kiss aired, the conversation soon went in other directions thanks to a flurry of responses he elicited, some supportive and others critical of the retired footballer's opinion.

Just six minutes after his original post, Ward responded to those critics.

'Everyone who comments on my page saying what dude did was fine is getting blocked. So far I've blocked 10 people,' he tweeted.

The former Tampa Bay Buccaneer and Houston Texans running back continued to defend his words into Saturday night.

'The paring (sic) your tongue into the other persons mouth is a little over board,' he wrote. 'But people seen that as oh I'm bashing him because he's gay. Who cares!!!'

Not all of Ward's followers disagreed with his stance. Several hours into his tirade, he wrote:

'But for real though most of u need to read the bible. It'll explain a lot in that book. #knowledge'

To which @Numerologynow replied:

'I DON'T NEED THE BIBLE to know what @ESPN showed on TV was Disgusting - America is going the way of Rome #HISTORY'

Context: Though gay marriage and homosexual kisses have become more commonplace in certain entertainment shows, some argue that the hyper-masculine world of football is not ready for the shift

Split decision: Ward immediately began to defend himself as critics--and supporters--gave their 2 cents

#knowledge: Ward suggested that his critics read the Holy Bible

While his followers appeared split as to whether to applaud or condemn Ward's candor, Ward refused to back down.

His last tweet on the subject, posted Sunday morning after 2am reads:'Twitter. The people that twisted my words around are the same people who are on twitter 24/7 trying 2get some1 famous 2 say the wrong thing.'

While Ward appears to be the most outspoken critic of Michael Sam connected to the NFL thus far, his condemnation of the on-air kiss was not the first.

Current Miami Dolphin Don Jones tweeted 'OMG' and then 'Horrible' in reaction to the kiss, according to the Miami Herald.
