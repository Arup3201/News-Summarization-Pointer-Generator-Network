Widely considered as one of Sweden’s greatest footballers, Larsson started and finished his high-level career in Helsingborg. In between, he played for Feyenoord, Celtic and Barcelona. He also joined Manchester United on a three-month loan in 2007.

Helsingborg has not placed better than fifth since winning the Swedish league in 2011. The team finished a disappointing ninth in the recently ended 2014 season, 23 points behind winner Malmo.

In his playing days, Larsson wore the shirts of clubs like Feyenoord, Celtic, Barcelona and Manchester United
