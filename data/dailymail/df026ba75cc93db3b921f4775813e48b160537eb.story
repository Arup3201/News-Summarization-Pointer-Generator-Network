It may be 65 years since Yeovil Town last faced Manchester United but for one United follower, it still feels like only yesterday.

For John Butterfield, 81, will be the only United supporter at Huish Park on Sunday that was also on the terraces on February 12, 1949. That was the day when Sir Matt Busby’s team hosted non-league Yeovil, the Southern League outfit that had startled top-flight Sunderland in the 4th round to secure a glamour tie against Manchester United at Maine Road.

As it transpired, it was like carthorses against greyhounds as United blitzed their visitors, winning 8-0 in front of a quite remarkable crowd of 81,565.

It is the 8th biggest attendance to watch a Manchester United game and testament to just how highly the FA Cup was revered in a bygone era.

‘I will never forget that day,’ Butterfield tells Sportsmail, ‘I had a brain operation in 1996. I came off my ladder and cracked my skull. I died twice that night. That’s what the kids told me. It affects my short-term memory. I couldn’t tell you what I had for dinner yesterday but that day against Yeovil is still as clear as day.

John bursts into a nostalgic smile as takes a trip down memory line: ‘They were closing the gates half-an-hour before kick-off because there were so many people. My ticket cost me 3 shillings - or 15 pence.

‘Amazing’, he adds, blowing out his cheeks. ‘The atmosphere was really special, they had all us youngsters on their shoulders, passing us forward so we could see the game. It was another world to these days.

‘Jackie Rowley scored five, Ronald Burke two, then Stan Pearson and Charlie Mitten sealed the victory.’

He has been to every United cup final since 1948 and missed just two European games in the last 15 years

Louis van Gaal will be hoping United win on Sunday as comfortably as they did back in 1949 

For Butterfield, known as ‘Old John’ by those who travel regularly with the United team - he has missed only two European away games in the last 15 years and attended every United cup final since 1948 - it was a day of special significance.

‘I was 16 and I went for a job interview for that day with my United scarf, my hat and my rattle. My mum said ‘You’ll never get a job like that.’ But I had to get to the game. I sat in the office and the manager says, “To be honest with you, Mr Butterfield, we don’t have any vacancies... but just hang on, I’m like you, I’m a Manchester United supporter. So that’s why I’m giving you a job.” So I ended up working there as an optical mechanic for the next 22 years - all to go and see Manchester United against Yeovil Town.’

Daily Mail clippings from the time reported: ‘Yeovil went home from Manchester, where the day’s biggest crowd saw them beaten 8-0 with £3,000 to add to the £2,000 they add from previous ties. Manchester United’s scoring machine clicked into action after five minutes and so brilliant was their football that the goals just had to come. Yeovil goalkeeper Stan Hall was doubly unlucky. Badly hurt after 20 minutes (a stomach cut which he said nothing about needed four stitches after the game), he found Rowley shooting “as hard as I have ever seen him”, to quote manager Sir Matt Busby.’
