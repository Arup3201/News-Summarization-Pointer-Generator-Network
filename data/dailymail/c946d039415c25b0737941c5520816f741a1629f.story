Manchester United new boy Daley Blind took time out of his day to reply to fans' letters and sign autographs for his most devoted supporters.

The 24-year-old, who joined Louis van Gaal's side for £14million in the summer, has shown he is keen to build up a rapport with Red Devils supporters by responding to letters with signed autographs.

Blind has been deployed in a defensive midfield role by his compatriot Louis van Gaal since sealing a move to Old Trafford.

His new side beat Queens Park Rangers on his debut before falling to a shock 5-3 defeat at Leicester City. 

Manchester United got back to winning ways on Saturday when they defeated West Ham 2-1 at Old Trafford.
