Once upon a time, the world's greatest sculptors came together with 4,000 tonnes of sand... and this was the result.

From the intricate strands of Rapunzel's hair to the uncannily realistic Game of Thrones characters, the creations for this year's Weston Sand Sculpture Festival are astonishing.

The annual event started in 2006, when two Dutch artists created a 30-foot King Kong sculpture on the beach in Weston, Somerset.

Now host to the leading artists in the field, the festival this year decided on fairy tales, myths and legends as a theme.

Once upon a time: This elaborate depiction of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale Rapunzel was created for Weston Sand Sculpture Festival

Katniss Everdeen, the Hunger Games character played by Jennifer Lawrence, is depicted bow and all looking over Peeta Mellark, played by Josh Hutcherson

With a fairy tales and legends theme, one artist created this Game Of Thrones sculpture out of the 4,000 tonnes of sand available

This Gulliver creation dwarfs the beach cafe a few metres away on the beach in North Somerset

Intricate: The artist did not skip any bit of detail on this portrayal of the White Queen from The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe

Even Romeo's clothes are intricately creased in this depiction of the moment he finds Juliet drugged and thinks she has died

Roald Dahl's magical little girl Matilda (left) is surrounded by stacks of books. The book-turned-movie Where The Wild Things Are (right) was also part of the line-up

Menacing: Festival-goers can pose inside a coffin alongside two of the scariest characters from Gothic fiction: Dracula and Frankenstein

Bottom from A Midsummer Night's Dream is portrayed as a portly beast that Titania falls in love with and dotingly cuddles. Paddington Bear also made an appearance

The artists, who have flocked from all over the world to take part in the festival which started in 2006, are constantly touching up their creations
