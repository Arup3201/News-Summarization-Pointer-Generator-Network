Backpacker Jack Davies, 21, was found hanged in Thailand 'after feeling pressure to come home' to Britain, an inquest heard

A backpacker who moved to Thailand after watching Leonardo DiCaprio film The Beach was found hanged in his hotel room 'after feeling pressure to come home'.

Jack Davies, 21, was found dead 6,000 miles from home, moving to the tropical paradise after seeing the Danny Boyle cult movie, an inquest heard.

The tragic globetrotter spent three years partying with fellow travellers before settling down on the picturesque Phi Phi islands, off the coast of Phuket, for work.  

Mr Davies stayed in Thailand after his tourist visa expired and worked in a bar.

He was said to be having the 'time of his life' on the idyllic islands, exploring the white sandy beaches, crystal clear waters and stunning mountains. 

But friends said he felt 'under pressure to go home' to Llanelli, south-west Wales, before his death. 

An inquest heard how Jack - known to his friends as Jay - had been out drinking with his friends shortly before his death in August last year.

He left his friends and went back to the K Guest house where he had been staying.

Jack's friends later found his body and raised the alarm. Emergency services rushed to the scene but he was declared dead shortly after they arrived.

Police in Thailand said his death was 'not suspicious' and sent a file to the UK for the inquest at Llanelli Town Hall. 

Carmarthen coroner Mark Layton, recording a narrative verdict, said he could not be satisfied that Mr Davies intended to kill himself.

He said: 'He was found by a friend who had been out drinking in town with him and came back to find Jay hanging there.

'The question of intent remains unclear.'

His parents Christine and Jonathan Davies flew to Thailand to bring their son's body home. They did not attend the inquest.

In a statement last year they said: 'Jack was a lovely boy and everybody loved him.'
