Accused: Baseel Abdul-Amir Saad. Saad is a Detroit-area soccer player who police say critically injured a referee by punching him during a match on Sunday

A Detroit-area soccer player faces a felony assault charge for allegedly punching a referee during an adult-league match, critically injuring the ref.

Baseel Abdul-Amir Saad was arraigned Monday in Livonia District Court on a charge of assault with intent to do great bodily harm. Bond was set at $500,000, and a probable-cause hearing was set for July 10.

Saad's lawyer, Brian Berry, said his client is cooperating with police and is not guilty of the charge.

Saad punched the unnamed referee in 
the head after the referee indicated he planned to eject the 36-year-old
 Dearborn resident from a game Sunday at Mies Park, Livonia police Lt. 
Tom Goralski said.

Joseph Cosenza, an opposing player, says Saad had left the park by the time police arrived.

'He got away, took off with one of his buddies, jumped in their car. ... A couple of our players were able to take pictures of the car and the license plate. Took off. The cops found the car and the driver,' he told Fox 2 News.

He says Saad tripped another player and it looked as though he punched the referee in the throat and under the chin, knocking him out and causing a head injury.

The referee was in critical condition Monday afternoon, authorities said.

Saad wasn't at the field when police arrived, Goralski said. The lieutenant said Saad surrendered Monday.

Berry questioned whether his client was the reason for the referee's injuries.

'As
 the case progresses we expect to learn the cause of the referee's 
injuries,' the lawyer said in an email. 'I can further state that Mr. 
Saad cooperated with the police investigation and voluntarily turned 
himself in to the Livonia Police Department to stand trial for the 
charges he is faced with.

'We send our prayers out to the referee and his family, and we hope for a quick recovery.'

Violence
 is not uncommon in soccer and other sports, as illustrated by the 
recorded telephone message at the National Association of Sports 
Officials in Racine, Wisconsin.

On
 April 27, 2013, a then-17-year-old player punched referee Ricardo 
Portillo over being called for a foul during a game in a soccer game in 
Taylorsville, Utah, near Salt Lake City. Portillo, a father of three, 
died after one week in a coma.

The teen pleaded guilty to a homicide charge.

'The referee is knocked out. He's not waking up,' the witness can be heard telling officers during the emergency call
