The astounding response to Fernando Torres' homecoming shows no sign of waning as the Chelsea flop continues to prove a record-breaking hit on his return to Atletico Madrid.

Torres attracted the biggest welcome ever for a Spanish player's unveiling at a club with 45,000 fans turning out to watch him wave and juggle on the Vicente Calderon pitch.

Now the No 19 shirt he will wear is breaking its own benchmarks at the club. 

Fernando Torres has been given a hero's welcome on his return to Atletico Madrid 

Replicas of the No 19 shirt Torres will wear are flying off the shelves in record numbers in Madrid

Spanish media crane their cameras to get shots of Atleti's prodigal son 

The Atletico store alone sold 2,000 of the strip with Torres' name and 19 on the back on Sunday alone, Marca reports, at an average of 222 shirts an hour if the nine hours the shop was open are taken into account. 

Torres takes the 19 worn previously at the club by Diego Costa, before the Brazil-born Spaniard made a £32million move to Chelsea where he's scored 15 goals in 25 appearances. 

The No 9 Torres called his own while scoring 84 goals in 214 league matches for Atletico before going to Liverpool seven-and-a-half year ago, is now worn by Croatian star Mario Mandzukic. 

A record 45,000 fans turned out to see Torres unveiled at the club on Saturday

Torres hasn't gone with 19 just to have some sort of nine on his back, but in tribute to his hero Kiko who also played for Spain and up front for Atletico for tha majority of his career.  

Torres has joined Atletico on loan from AC Milan, who made their deal permanent after taking the unwanted striker on loan from Chelsea.

Having played for Ateltico between 2001 and 2007, Torres could make his return against none other than Real Madrid in the first leg of their Copa del Rey round of 16 tie.
