Jailed: Carrie Russel, 26, was put in a Japanese prison for possessing Adderall - which is illegal in Japan

A teacher from Oregon has been freed from a Japanese jail after being locked up for three weeks for possessing the prescription drug Adderall.

Carrie Russell, 26, was arrested on February 20 after admitting to police that she had been sent a stash of Adderall pills in the mail.

The medicine, prescribed by her doctor back home, is common in the United States, but banned in Japan.

She was let out of jail on Tuesday after U.S. government officials, including Caroline Kennedy, daughter of President Kennedy and the current ambassador to Japan, negotiated her release.

Russell's mother, a doctor, posted the a three-month supply of the pills to an address in South Korea, from which Russell forwarded them to her home in Nagoya, Japan, according to The Oregonian.

Police tracked her down to a restaurant and arrested her while she was dining with friends. She knew just four words of Japanese.

Russell, who had a job in Nagoya teaching English, told the newspaper she was taken to a detention center with Japanese cellmates and given chores to do. She said the facility was 'not anything terrifying'.

She said she was fed Bento box meals in women's prison, where guards tried to speak with her in English and she picked up more Japanese.

In the meantime, members of Congress, the Japanese embassy, and even the White House were reportedly involved in intense negotiations to set her free - despite the Japan's harsh anti-amphetamine laws, which often carry lengthy jail sentences.

The details of the negotiations are not clear, but Kennedy, who made the case a priority, managed to convince local prosecutors not to file charges, and to let her go.

Russell's family wrote an apologetic letter to the Japanese government, saying she had never intended to break the law.

In a statement announcing her release, Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) proclaimed that 'common sense has won the day'.

He continued: 'I want to thank Ambassador Kennedy and her staff for working closely with our office and their Japanese counterparts to get her released.'

Russell's stepfather, attorney Loren Podwill, has flown to Japan to meet her and bring her back to Oregon.

She added that she wants to come back, if she can find another job. She said: 'In spite of this, I love Japan'. 

Locked up: Russell was held for almost three weeks in Nagoya, Japan, where she had been working as an English teacher
