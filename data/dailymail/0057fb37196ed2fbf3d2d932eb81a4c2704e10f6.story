Out of Europe, out of the FA Cup and on the verge of being out of the Premier League title race, this was the first of nine games Manchester City simply could not afford not to win.

Operation siege mentality kicked in shortly after the final whistle of Wednesday's Champions League exit at the hands of Barcelona when Joe Hart faced the cameras in the Nou Camp tunnel.

'I will never give up, ever, and I could safely say that nobody in our dressing room will ever give up either,' said the defiant goalkeeper.

'West Brom is a huge game and we turn our focus to that. We have no excuse not to throw everything at the Premier League now and give our all - to the fans, the owner, to everyone.'

His under-fire manager sang from the same hymn sheet in his programme notes.

'It's not impossible for Chelsea to drop six points,' Manuel Pellegrini wrote.

'We have to continue to believe.

'It is nonsense to suggest there is nothing to play for.'

The message spread to the home support. They like being the underdogs here (remember last season?) and from the off the masses were behind their team.

After 90 seconds they got a boost they could not have dreamed of when referee Neil Swarbrick wrongly sent off Gareth McAuley after last-man Craig Dawson brought down Wilfried Bony on the edge of the area.

Apparently the joke flying around the Albion training ground is that the lookalike pair are never seen in the same place at the same time.

Nobody from the visiting contingent was laughing here.

This was time for City to prove themselves and prove to the nation that there is still life left in the title race.

Wilfried Bony, with no goals in six outings since his £28million switch from Swansea City, had his own point to make and he did so to break the deadlock, calmly capitalising on a lucky deflection to neatly turn, set himself up and fire the home side into the lead.

After help from the referee, City then got some from Albion. For long periods, with a game of attack vs defence taking place, the Etihad resembled a school playground. 

The woeful defensive mix-up that handed Fernando the second goal on a plate would have caused red faces in the classroom, let alone a Premier League dressing room.

The procession continued throughout the second half. In the absence of Yaya Toure, out with an Achilles problem, Frank Lampard probed and created. With West Brom reluctant to leave their own half there were few occasions when Hart, so busy on Wednesday night, had to contemplate taking off his slippers and putting down his pipe.

Manchester City midfielder Fernando doubled his side's lead in the 40th minute with a close-range finish 

City playmaker David Silva added a third in the 77th minute to complete the rout at the Etihad Stadium 

Saido Berahino inexplicably headed onto the bar from close range but other than that there was little to lift the mood of those who had travelled from the Black Country which will have darkened further when David Silva deflected sub Stevan Jovetic's shot home for the third.

At times this was City back to their fluent best. Quick short passes and chance after chance against overwhelmed opponents.

Too much, however, should not be read into this cakewalk. Tougher challenges will lie ahead and Pellegrini, who believes a lack of goals is what is hurting his team the most, will have been upset by the number of missed chances.

But on a sunny, spring afternoon at the Etihad we saw the first shoots of a City recovery which might just see a title challenge blossom.
