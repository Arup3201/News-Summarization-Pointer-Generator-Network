Bristol City maintained their unbeaten home record in League One as they secured a comfortable 2-0 win over Scunthorpe on Saturday to keep hot on the heels of table toppers Peterborough.

Aden Flint and Greg Cunningham were on target as Steve Cotterill's side secured back-to-back league wins as they remain a point behind Darren Ferguson's side.

Goals from Marcus Maddison, Kyle Vassell and Jack Payne gave the leaders a convincing 3-1 win at London Road.

Impressive: Bristol City make it back-to-back victories in the league as they saw off Scunthorpe

Table toppers: Kyle Vassell sets Peterborough on their way to a convincing victory against Port Vale

Setback: Fleetwood fell to defeat against Oldham to drop out of the automatic promotion places

However, Fleetwood tasted defeat for the first time this season when going down 1-0 at Oldham after Jonathan Forte converted a penalty in first-half stoppage time.

Bradford suffered a surprise 3-1 loss at home to Yeovil, with Aaron Martin bagging a brace and AJ Leitch-Smith also netting for the visitors, while the Bantams could only respond through Rory McArdle.

Rochdale secured the most impressive success of the day, though, with Peter Vincenti scoring twice in between Matt Done and Calvin Andrew strikes in a 4-0 romp at Crawley.

Colchester managed to pick up just their second point of the season in a goalless draw at Walsall. 

Elsewhere, Barnsley's game against Doncaster, Preston's against Leyton Orient and Sheffield United's clash against MK Dons were all postponed due to international call-ups.
