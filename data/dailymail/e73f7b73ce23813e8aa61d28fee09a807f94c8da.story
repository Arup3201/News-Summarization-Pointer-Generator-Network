A mother whose four-year-old son was starved, scalded, beaten with a hammer and then buried in a shallow grave has been sentenced to at least 20 years in prison for her role in the boy's death.

Stephanie Sloop, 31, was given 20 years to life behind bars for Ethan Stacy's 2010 death.

Sloop pleaded guilty to aggravated murder and obstructing justice under a deal with prosecutors in Farmington, Utah.

Stephanie Sloop, charged with aggravated murder in the death of her son, Ethan Stacy, enters the courtroom in Farmington, Utah, on Monday

Sloop sobbed in court as she admitted she was completely responsible for her son's brutal death, following days of starvation and torture at the hands of her husband, 'because I was his mommy'.

Prosecutors said Sloop failed to stop her husband and Ethan's stepfather, Nathan Sloop, from abusing her son and didn't call for help. They asked that she spends the rest of her life in prison.

The 31-year-old fidgeted today as the court heard details of the little boy's brutal torture.

A medical examiner testified that Ethan died from a combination of too many over-the-counter medications, aspiration pneumonia and severe burns, likely caused from hot water in a tub.

Aspiration pneumonia is caused by an inhalation of foreign materials into the lungs, potentially vomit, or as prosecutors suggested, fecal matter that the boy allegedly was forced to eat.

The burns would have required skin grafts and weeks of hospital treatment, doctors said.

Four-year-old Ethan Stacy was beaten beyond recognition with a hammer by his stepfather and buried in a shallow grave in 2010. His mother failed to stop his torture and abuse

Nathan Sloop confessed to wrapping the body in garbage bags and putting him in a shallow grave he dug on the mountainside.

The boy’s body and items used to bury it were put in the hole in layers. A hammer was used to disfigure the boy. 

Stephanie Sloop bought lighter fluid, a shovel and some gloves at a hardware store beforehand. 

The day the boy was buried, Nathan Sloop sent a text message to his wife, which was shown in court: 'Baby can you get antioxidant vitamins please. That would be great. I can’t wait to take you to Happy Sumo. Memories. Love you!!!' 

Days later, they called police and reported Ethan as missing. Nathan Sloop ultimately led police to where the boy was buried. 

Sloop's lawyer told the court that she suffered from 'battered wife syndrome' and had a prescription medication addiction while her son was being abused, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. 

Ethan’s father, Joe Stacy, was present in the courtroom to watch his ex-wife be sentenced. 

He said that he had been 'broken up' by his son's death.

Nathan Sloop, 35, was sentenced in February to 25 years to life in prison for the murder of his four-year-old stepson. 

Sloop buried the child on Powder Mountain in Weber Country, Utah after he left the child's face disfigured by hammer blows and his grave sprinkled with dog food. 

Sloop was  sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for the murder and one to 15 years for aggravated assault by a prisoner for attacking a David County jail officer. Sloop, 35, had pleaded guilty but mentally ill.

A number of other charges were dismissed as part of a plea deal, which also spared him from the death penalty. 

Sloop’s attorney, Richard Mauro, said his client’s mental illness coupled with a high number of prescription painkillers and other medications Sloop was taking at the time led to his indifference to the child’s life.

Previous court documents show Sloop was prescribed 4,146 pills in an 11-month period. Among the prescriptions were Lortab, Valium, Percocet, Xanax and an antihistamine.
