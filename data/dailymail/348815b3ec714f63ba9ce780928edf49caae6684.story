A Bengal tiger snatched a man off a fishing boat in eastern India, dragging him away into a mangrove swamp as his children looked on in horror, according to his son.

The attack happened on Thursday as Sushil Manjhi and his son and daughter were crab fishing in a stream in the Sunderbans National Park. The tiger leaped aboard the boat and clamped its jaws on Manjhi's neck, said Sushil's son, Jyotish.

The tiger 'quickly flung my father on his back and gave a giant leap before disappearing into the forest,' said Jyotish from his village of Lahiripur in West Bengal state

'Shortly after we reached the spot, around 7am, we got a whiff of a strange odour. We immediately decided to turn back to a safer zone,' Jyotish told The Times of India.

He told the newspaper they paddled towards a less dense area when the tiger struck.

'Suddenly, my sister cried out: "Dada, bagh (tiger)". I was stunned, and my body froze. All I saw a flash of yellow. It took me a moment to register the gruesome sight before me. My father was completely buried under the beast,' he said.

He said he and his sister tried to beat 
the animal with sticks and a knife, but the thrashing had no effect. His
 father was dragged away and was presumed dead.

The national park is one of the largest reserves for the royal Bengal tiger. Thursday's attack was the fourth deadly assault by a tiger this year in the Sunderbans, according to wildlife officials.

India has more than half of the 3,200 tigers believed to be left in the wild in the world. But as the country undergoes breakneck development to accommodate the growth of its 1.2 billion people, tiger habitats have been shrinking.

The big cat's numbers have also dwindled because of rampant poaching to feed a flourishing market for tiger organs and bones in China.
