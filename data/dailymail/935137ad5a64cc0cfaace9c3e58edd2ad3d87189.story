The Tottenham Hotspur fans sang Harry Kane’s name loudly as he was substituted in the 84th minute, once victory over Burnley was all but assured.

‘He scores when he wants,’ they chanted in acknowledgement of the striker heading in his 14th goal in 23 appearances.

He shook hands with manager Mauricio Pochettino and warmly embraced his replacement, Roberto Soldado, the £26million signing who was once backed to fill the gaping chasm left by Gareth Bale’s departure but who has failed to live up to that billing.

Instead it is the 21-year-old from Walthamstow, a product of the academy system, who looks most likely to make up the goal deficit left in the Welshman’s wake. His confidence is soaring after scoring in each of his last three games and Kane believes he can be the 20-goal-a-season man Spurs have been searching for.

Burnley again named an entirely British-born starting XI for Saturday’s Premier League game at Tottenham. The last team to do so in the Premier League were Blackpool against Manchester United on the final day of the 2010-11 season.

‘My first target was 10 goals and I reached that,’ said Kane, ‘My next target is 20 goals, so six to go.’

While Soldado admitted to being ashamed hearing Spurs fans sing his name even as he failed to justify his hefty price tag, boyhood Spurs fan Kane was delighted, recalling cheering his own heroes.

‘It’s great to hear them sing my name, like when I came off the pitch today,’ he said. ‘I used to sing the name of Teddy Sheringham, he was a big idol of mine, and Robbie Keane.

‘It can only spur you on. You can only do your best for the fans. If they are singing your name it always feels good.’

Erik Lamela scored with a sublime strike to give Tottenham the lead for the second time against Burnley

With Soldado misfiring, however, Spurs have stepped up their interest in West Bromwich Albion’s £25m-rated striker Saido Berahino after shelving a move for Jay Rodriguez. The Saints striker remains a target for Pochettino, but the delay in his return from a knee injury has forced Spurs into reassessing their January plans.

It was current top man Kane, though, who put Spurs in front in the 21st minute on Saturday with a header from a Nacer Chadli cross. His effort was cancelled out on 27 minutes by Ashley Barnes’s stunning strike, which sailed into the roof of the net.

Erik Lamela executed a similarly spectacular strike eight minutes later, which eventually sealed all three points for the home side. It stoked the fires for Spurs on the back of a win over Swansea last week and a 4-0 League Cup thrashing of Newcastle.

Kane claims his rise shows that young English talent can prevail even in the mega-rich Premier League with all its foreign imports.‘Sometimes young English players who come through the ranks don’t always get the chance at the top level,’ he said. ‘I have been fortunate enough to get a chance and I’ve been able to take it. So it proves you don’t always have to buy players.’

Pochettino seems to have found a settled starting 11 who he claims have bought into his philosophy of pressing football. It has been said that players need two hearts to play for the Argentine, such is the work ethic he demands.

Kane added: ‘Christmas is normally a time where teams get tired but you can see we’re really stepping it up.’
