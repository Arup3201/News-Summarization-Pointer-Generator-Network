Blackburn have signed Everton defender Shane Duffy for a fee of £1.5million. 

The Republic of Ireland international struggled to breakthrough at Goodison Park under both Roberto Martinez and his predecessor David Moyes and has opted to drop down a division to link up with Championship Rovers. 

Duffy spent last season on loan at Yeovil, making 39 appearances in Somerset. He also had loan stints at Burnley and Scunthorpe after moving to Everton in 2009.

His path to the Everton first team is blocked by Phil Jagielka, Sylvain Distin, Antolin Alcarez and the emergence of John Stones.

The centre-back made his senior international debut against Costa Rica in June.

Duffy had been set to make his bow for the national team in 2010 but had to have life-saving surgery after suffering a freak accident in Ireland training.

He suffered a lacerated liver after colliding with a team-mate and lost 3.6 litres of blood, around two-thirds of the body's supply. 

Duffy made 10 appearances in all competitions for the Toffees, making his bow in December 2009 in a Europa League clash with AEK Athens.
