Police have formed an unprecedented ring of steel around the Middleton's £5million country mansion to protect Prince George and his parents from intruders.

Officers on horseback and a helicopter with heat-seeking technology on board have been patrolling the perimeter around the 18-acre Bucklebury Manor estate in Berkshire, where the royal trio stayed last night.

The local council imposed no-stopping regulations on roads near the Georgian home where a team of armed royal guards, who accompany Kate and William everywhere, are also stationed.

Back again: The couple spent a week at Bucklebury Manor shortly before Kate returned to London to give birth, and the Cambridges were back last night surrounded by police

Ring of steel: A police van parked on Pease Hill near Bucklebury Manor, which had its perimeter patrolled by police on the ground and in the air

Operation: Police on horseback kept watch around Bucklebury Manor while officers also stood guard and prevented cars stopping on surrounding roads as they protect the baby and his parents

Grand: The Manor House owned by Carole and Michael Middleton has 18-acres, and has the two-day-old future king inside today

Experts say that the security detail is much larger than when Kate and William visited before the birth because of the precious prince now inside.

It is likely to be because royal children have been targets in the past.

In the weeks after Prince William was born in June 1982, Michael Fagan forced his way into Buckingham Palace and then broke into the Queen's bedroom.

Eight years earlier, Princess Anne avoided a kidnap attempt by a mentally ill man who shot four people on Pall Mall in the process.

'What you need is a combination of technical and human resources, and the police have done that by deploying people on the ground and a helicopter overhead,' former head of royal protection Dai Davies told the Daily Telegraph.

'The heightened security around the royal baby might seem excessive, but if an incident did happen heads would roll.  In that sense the police are damned if they do and damned if they don't'. 

Very happy: Kate and William both smiled and waved to crowds outside the gates, but Kensington Palace would not reveal where they were heading

The police cove on the ground and in the air would be to spot foreign photographers or criminals trying to get close to George.

It has been estimated that the current security measures will cost £5,000 a day for police patrols and £900 an hour for the helicopter above.

Their were clear hints that Kate and 
William were off to Bucklebury last night after the heightened police 
presence arrived yesterday lunchtime.

Shortly afterwards, less than 24 hours after returning to
 Kensington Palace from hospital with their baby son, the Duke and 
Duchess of Cambridge headed to stay with Carole and Michael.

Special moment: Prince William and Kate waved and smiled broadly as they carried their son George out of hospital for the first time

Happy: Carole Middleton and Michael Middleton leave The Lindo Wing after visiting The Duchess Of Cambridge and her newborn son, and now they have them staying with them

The new parents 
drove away in a Range Rover at 1pm yesterday, with Prince George 
strapped safely in the back. Earlier he had been visited by his 
great-grandmother, the Queen, and uncle, Prince Harry.

An
 hour or so later the family arrived at the £4.8million Georgian mansion
 recently bought by Kate’s parents in the leafy village of Bucklebury. 
Friends say Carole Middleton has been busy redecorating a 
‘nursery-style’ room for her first grandchild.

Yellow
 police cones with a 'no waiting' symbols lined both sides of the road 
every few yards for around a mile either side of the majesticmanor.

A
 bright yellow sign stuck to a road sign confirmed an 'emergency' 
three-week bylaw prohibited any form of waiting in the road while a pair
 of police officers stood at both entrances to the Grade II listed 
Georgian pile, while marked police cars swept past the entrances every 
couple of minutes.

A
 large police horsebox marked 'Mounted section' arrived in the 
picturesque village at lunchtime and a small marquee surrounded by 
marked and unmarked police cars was visible in a nearby field.

It
 was not possible to tell whether the Duchess' parents or her siblings, 
Pippa and James, were at the vast estate, set in 18 acres of land and 
boasting its own tennis court, swimming pool and library.

Palace
 officials refused to comment on the couple’s move, saying they were 
keen to enjoy some ‘private time together, like any new family’. They 
added: ‘They just want to get to know their son.’
