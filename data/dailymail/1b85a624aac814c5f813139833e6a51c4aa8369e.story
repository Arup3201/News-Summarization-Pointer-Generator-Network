A grandmother was brutally attacked in her own home by a violent prisoner on day release, meaning she could not be with her dying husband of 55 years. 

Theresa Cain, 78, was left lying in a pool of her own blood following the vicious assault by inmate Paul Steadman, who had a history of violence against vulnerable people. 

The pensioner spent more than a month in hospital following the horrific ordeal which meant she could not be by the bedside of her husband, John, in the last weeks before he died.  

Theresa Cain, 78, was brutally attacked by a violent prisoner on day release from Kirkham Prison, which meant she could not be with her dying husband, John, with whom she had been married 55 years

Steadman, 45, had been serving an indeterminate sentence in relation to another burglary at a pensioner's home when he was let out of Kirkham Prison, in Lancashire on day release and failed to return. 

Mrs Cain's son, Peter, 42, said: 'It's so tragic.

'The last two weeks of my father's life, my mother couldn't be with him because she was in her own hospital bed.'

In a victim statement, he said: 'Due to mum's head injury she did not understand what was happening to dad and it was heartbreaking having to explain to her time and time again that dad had passed away - this was emotionally draining both for mum and me.

'The injury to her head had robbed her of the precious time both she and my dad had left together after 55 years of marriage.

'As a family, we tried to arrange our fathers funeral trying to involve mum in decisions but ultimately she could not remember making any of the arrangements.

'This is not how 55 years of marriage should end.'

When the attack happened on May 4 this year, Mrs Cain, from Preston, had been to visit her husband in hospital.

Her son had been trying to contact her, but sensed something was wrong after a couple of hours and asked his sister to check on her. 

He said: 'My sister rang me to say she had found my mum was face down in a pool of blood and an ambulance was on the way.

'I got in the car and drove as fast as I could to the house.

'There was an ambulance, police cars, police with dogs and I was told I couldn't see my mum because it was a crime scene. I just felt sick with worry.'

He added: 'It left me very angry and bitter that we've been let down. Beforehand my mum was an independent, mobile lady.

'She looked after all my dad's medication, she was a frequent person in the bank, she would get the bus to town, visit her friends, go for a coffee.

'She rarely does that now. She's got memory loss issues, she doesn't remember visitors she's had, she doesn't remember taking her medication. It's like she's got dementia over night.'

Mrs Cain's son, Peter (pictured), 42, said the attack had robbed his mother of her confidence and said 'this is not how 55 years of marriage should end' 

He said that since the attack, her confidence had been affected and she had been moved  in to sheltered accommodation.

Steadman is due to be sentenced for the attack on Thursday at Preston Crown Court.

He will also be sentenced for other offences committed between May 3 and May 5, while absconding from prison.

He has admitted burglary, aggravated burglary, grievous bodily harm, assault by beating, two counts of robbery and two counts of possession of an offensive weapon in a public place.

On the upcoming sentencing, Mr Cain, from Bamber Bridge in Lancashire, said: 'I want him to go away for life.

'He should never be walking the streets again. He's got a history of violent crime which hasn't improved and he's a danger to society.

'My biggest thing that I want answered is why he was let out on day release.

'I dread to think it would happen to somebody else out there.

'He was supposed to be serving an indeterminate sentence. He shouldn't have been walking the streets.'

Prisons Minister Andrew Selous said: 'Open prisons and temporary licence are important tools in rehabilitating long-term offenders, but not at the expense of public safety.

'Absconds have reached record lows under this government, falling by more than 80 per cent in the last 10 years, but we have not been complacent.

'We have made major changes to tighten the system and these have contributed to a 40 percent fall in temporary release failures in the past 12 months.

'In future when prisoners are let out on temporary licence they will be tagged, more strictly risk assessed and tested in the community under strict conditions before being released.'

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said prisoners could only be transferred to open conditions once they had passed a thorough risk assessment and been deemed suitable.

The spokesman added that any prisoner who absconded, failed to return from a period of temporary release or committed a crime during their sentence, will not be able to return to an open prison or be granted temporary release again.
