The United States last night joined the United Nations in condemning Israel after tank shells tore apart a school refuge in Gaza killing 15 men, women and children and injuring more than 100.

The victims, who had fled their homes after warnings from Israel’s military and were sheltering in the school, were killed yesterday morning when two classrooms were destroyed.

UN officials said they had told the Israeli military 17 times that the school in Gaza’s biggest refugee camp was a shelter for Palestinian civilians fleeing fighting in the coastal strip.

Last night, in a rare criticism of Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip, the White House said it was ‘extremely concerned’ that thousands of Palestinians were not safe even in UN-designated shelters. 

Spokesman Bernadette Meehan said: ‘This violence underscores the need to achieve a ceasefire as soon as possible.’

Later yesterday, 15 Palestinians were killed and 160 wounded in an Israeli air strike which blew apart a busy market in Shejaiya.

The air strike happened during a four-hour ceasefire, which Israel later claimed applied only to areas where its soldiers were not already operating.

Speaking about the warnings that the school was being used as a shelter, Pierre Krahenbuhl, head of the United Nations Relief And Works Agency (UNRWA), said the last notification was given just hours before the pre-dawn attack. 

‘I condemn in the strongest possible terms this serious violation of international law by Israeli forces,’ he said last night.

Israel claimed that mortar shells had been fired from near the school, and that its soldiers fired back.

‘Five Israeli tank shells struck the people and killed many of them as they slept,’ added Khalil al-Halabi, director of UNRWA’s northern Gaza operations. 

‘Those people came to the school because it is a designated UN shelter.’

Assad Sabah said he and his five children were huddling under desks in one of the classrooms because of the constant sound of tank fire throughout the night. ‘We were scared to death,’ he said.

‘After 4.30am, tanks started firing more. Three explosions shook the school. One classroom collapsed over the head of the people who were inside.’

The front wall of the classroom was blown out, leaving debris and bloodied clothing. Another strike tore a large hole in the ceiling of a second-floor classroom.

At the edge of the schoolyard, some 20 donkeys lay dead, still tied to railings.

Abdel-Karim al-Masamha, 27, said he and his family had gone to the school after fleeing fighting near their home in the northern Gaza Strip.

‘We did not find safety here,’ he said. ‘People were dismembered.’

Yesterday the UK announced it was stepping up its humanitarian response to the Gaza crisis with an additional £3million for the World Food Programme’s emergency appeal to help deal with food shortages.

The money will provide emergency food for more than 300,000 people for one month and brings to £10million the amount released to help Gaza since the crisis began.

International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: ‘After more than three weeks, the death toll in Gaza is rising and more than 200,000 people, many of them children, have been displaced from their homes. We urgently need to stop the bloodshed.’

Israel said no UN facility had been intentionally targeted, but troops had responded to Hamas mortar fire nearby

Last week, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed alarm at the discovery of rockets at schools used by UNRWA.

The bombardment in Gaza continued yesterday with Israeli air strikes and shelling killing 40 Palestinians elsewhere in the coastal territory.

Five mosques that Israel says were being used by militants were also hit.
