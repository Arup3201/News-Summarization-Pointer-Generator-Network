‘Happy Birthday to You’ has been performed around the world in tribute to everyone from toddlers to centenarians for nearly 120 years, but few people know that the ubiquitous song is owned by a private company.

Now, the most famous ditty in the English language has found itself in the middle of a legal battle after a film production company filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the copyright protecting the song.

The proposed class action asks a federal court to declare the song to be in the public domain and that Warner/Chappel Music Inc, the music publishing arm of Warner Music Group, return ‘millions of dollars of unlawful licensing fees’ it has collected for reproductions and public performances of the song.

Songwriters: The simple four-line ditty was written in 1893 by Mildred and Patty Hill, two sisters from Louisville, Kentucky, and it was intended as a musical greeting performed in school by teachers

‘More than 120 years after the melody
to which the simple lyrics of “Happy Birthday to You” is set was first 
published, defendant Warner/Chappell boldly, but wrongfully and 
unlawfully, insists that it owns the copyright to “Happy Birthday to 
You,”’ the lawsuit said.

A representative of Warner/Chappell was not immediately available to comment on the lawsuit.

The
plaintiff is Good Morning To You Productions Corp, a New York company 
that says it is making a documentary about the song. Facing a penalty of
$150,000 if it used ‘Happy Birthday’ without permission, the company 
said it paid a $1,500 licensing fee in March.

Warner/Chappell
claims exclusive copyright to what Guinness World Records has called 
the most famous song in the English language. According to the lawsuit, 
the company has collected at least $2million annually in licensing fees.

Whenever
'Happy Birthday to You' is being sung for profit, as in movies, 
television shows and concerts, the performers or producers are required 
to pay licensing fees, or face a copyright infringement lawsuit.

Mystery: The Hill sisters called their tune 'Good Morning to All,' but sometime after its publication, someone had changed it to 'Happy Birthday to You'

But few people know that under 
copyright law, singing the song in any public venue constitutes a 
performance, which is why most restaurants have their waiting staff sing
alternative songs when celebrating patrons' birthday to avoid paying 
royalties.

‘If you want to 
sing it at your home at a birthday party you don't have to pay anything,
because that is a private performance,’ said George Washington 
University School of Law professor Robert Brauneis. ’But if you want to 
use it in a television show, a movie, or a television commercial, you'll
pay anywhere from $5,000 to $30,000 for those rights.’

Brauneis, who wrote a 68-page article about the song, told ABC in
2008 that one of the weaknesses of the copyright case is the murky 
authorship of the 'Happy Birthday' song. The other is the fact that the 
song's owner failed to properly renew the copyright on the standard 
version of the ditty in the 1960s, thus opening the door on a legal 
challenge. 

Free 'Happy Birthday!': A lawsuit filed by a production company seeks to prove that the 1893 song 'Happy Birthday to You' should be in the public domain

The song was first published in 1893 as ‘Good Morning to All.’ The simple four-line ditty was written by Mildred and Patty Hill, two sisters from Louisville, Kentucky, and it was intended as a musical greeting performed in school by teachers.

Patty was the one who wrote the 
lyrics, and her older sister, Mildred, came up with the tune. Both women
worked as teachers at the time.

The Hills' simple tune with a range 
of six notes and an average running time of 12 seconds was first 
published in 1893 as part of the songbook Song Stories for the 
Kindergarten.

Over the next 30 years, the song had 
evolved, first turning into a greeting from students to their teachers. 
Later it changed from 'Good Morning to All' to 'Good Morning to You,' 
with the name of the person the song was being performed for inserted in
the third line.

Long history: The song was first published in 1893 as 'Good Morning to All,' and was written by sisters Patty and Mildred Hill. The copyright to the ditty eventually came to be owned by Warner/Chappel Music Inc

It remains a mystery when exactly the
classroom tune transformed into a birthday song, and who was 
responsible for changing the Hills' lyrics. It is generally believed 
that the sisters were not the ones who altered the song.

A third Hill sister, Jessica, took 
'Happy Birthday' to Chicago publisher Clayton F. Summy Co., which 
officially released and copyrighted the work in 1935. Some years later, 
the publishing house was bought out by New York accountant John 
Sengstack, who renamed it Birch Tree Ltd.

Birch Tree retained the copyright on 
the song until 1988, when Warner/Chappell, the world's largest music 
publisher, purchased the company for $25million.

According to Billboard.com, the song has been considered as protected by copyright because the lyrics appeared in a songbook in 1924 and a piano arrangement for it was released in 1935.

A year after the publication of the songbook titled Song Stories for the Kindergarten containing the ditty, a copyright application was filed.

Under a revised copyright law, works created after 1923 are guarantee 95 years of protection.

Brauneis, the George Washington University Law School, professor, said he searched nationwide for evidence of a copyright for a combination of the melody for ‘Good Morning to All’ with the lyrics for ‘Happy Birthday to You’ for an article published in 2009 but did not find any.

‘I believe this song is in the public domain and therefore it is not owned by anyone,’ he told the New York Times Thursday.

Investors led by Edgar Bronfman Jr. bought Warner Music Group from Time Warner Inc in 2004 and sold it to its current owner, privately held Access Industries Inc, in 2011.

If the film production company's lawsuit fails, 'Happy Birthday to You' will remain under copyright protection until 2030. 

'Happy Birthday to You' began its life in 1893 under a different title, 'Good Morning to All.'

The simple four-line ditty was written by Mildred and Patty Hill, two sisters from Louisville, Kentucky, and it was intended as a musical greeting performed in school by teacher. 

Patty Hill, the younger of two siblings, was a nursery school and kindergarten teacher who wrote the lyrics. She would later go on to create the popular toy Patty Hill blocks. 

Mildred Hill, who came up with the tune, also started her career in the classroom, but she later became a composer, organist and music scholar specializing in Negro spirituals.

The Hills' simple tune with a range of six notes and an average running time of 12 seconds was first published in 1893 as part of the songbook Song Stories for the Kindergarten.

Over the next 30 years, the song had evolved, first turning into a greeting from students to their teachers. Later it changed from 'Good Morning to All' to 'Good Morning to You,' with the name of the person the song was being performed for inserted in the third line.

It remains a mystery when exactly the classroom tune transformed into a birthday song, and who was responsible for changing the Hills' lyrics. It is generally believed that the sisters were not the ones who altered the song.    

In 1924, 'Happy Birthday to You' appeared in a songbook edited by Robert H. Coleman. By mid-1930s, the ditty had become enormously popular, appearing in several films and a Broadway show. The celebratory song was even used for Western Union's first ever singling telegram.

When the ubiquitous melody, which most people assumed was in the public domain, appeared uncredited in Irving Berlin's musical As Thousands Cheer, Patty and Mildred's sister, Jessica Hill, filed a lawsuit against the producers and managed to obtain a copyright for her sisters by demonstrating the link between their classroom tune and the popular birthday song.

Jessica Hill took 'Happy Birthday' to Chicago publisher Clayton F. Summy Co., which officially released and copyrighted the work in 1935. Some years later, the publishing house was bought out by New York accountant John Sengstack, who renamed it Birch Tree Ltd.

Birch Tree retained the copyright on the song until 1988, when Warner/Chappell, the world's largest music publisher, purchased the company for $25million. Warner/Chappell has been earning about $2million annually in royalties from the song, with the proceeds divided between the music publisher and the Hill Foundation, which has been established after the passing of the sisters.

Both Mildred and Patty died unmarried and childless, and their stake in the song had passed to their nephew, Andrew Hill, who has since died as well.
