The Archbishop of Canterbury today defended rioters who took part in last summer's unrest claiming many young people felt 'let down' by Britain.

He called on the public in a broadcast New Year message not to give up on the younger generation and show them support and love so they can 'flourish'.

Dr Rowan Williams described the violence as 'angry' and 'lawless' but claimed the country had failed its youngsters by being 'suspicious and hostile' towards them and not providing good role models.

Describing the disturbances which swept the country, he said: 'Quite a lot of the images we're likely to remember from the footage of the riots in the summer will be of young people out of control in the streets, walking off with looted property from shops, noisily confronting police and so on.

Dr Williams: 'The events of the summer were certainly horrific'

'It all feeds into the national habit of being suspicious and hostile when we see groups of youngsters on street corners or outside shops and bus shelters.

'We walk a bit more quickly and hope we can pass without some sort of confrontation.

'The events of the summer were certainly horrific. They showed us a face of our society we don't like to think about - angry, destructive, lawless.'

In his message screened on BBC1, he said those involved were a minority and most young people shared the 'general feeling of dismay at this behaviour'.

Dr
Williams was filmed talking to young peopleÂ  at Kids' Company in south 
London that helps youngsters in poverty who are at risk of falling into 
criminal behaviour.

He 
said: We have to ask what hind of society is it that let's down so many 
of its young people.That doesn't provide good role models and drives 
youngsters further into unhappiness. and anxiety by only showing them 
suspicion and negativity.

'When
you see the gifts they can offer, the energy that can be released when 
they feel safe and loved, you see what a tragedy we so often allow to 
happen.

Dr Williams' comments risk another clash with David Cameron who warned last month the Church should 'keep on the agenda that speaks to the whole country.'

Meanwhile, Pope Benedict praised young people as key to securing a future of hope despite what he called 'shadows on the horizon of today's world.'

Papal blessing: Pope Benedict celebrates mass in St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican today with a New year message

In the splendour of St. Peter's Basilica, with ambassadors to the Holy See from dozens of countries seated in the front rows, the Pontiff, wearing white vestments with gold-colored trimmings, celebrated Mass on a day the Vatican dedicates to world peace.

He said: 'I would like to underline the fact that, in the face of the shadows that obscure the horizon of today's world, to assume responsibility for educating young people in knowledge of the truth, in fundamental values and virtues, is to look to the future with hope.'

Young people, he said, must 'learn the importance and the art of peaceful coexistence, mutual respect, dialogue and understanding.

'Young people by their nature are open to these attitudes, but the social reality in which they grow up can lead them to think and act in the opposite way, even to be intolerant and violent.

But they will become 'builders of peace' if properly educated, he predicted.

The 84-year-old looked tired during Mass, but his voice was strong, and he smiled and chatted briefly with families and young children who carried gifts to him during the ceremony.

He seemed amused by one pacifier-sucking infant as the parents kneeled before the Pope.

As he has for the past few months, Benedict used a wheeled platform, guided by ushers, to moved down the basilica's long aisle between entrance and main altar.

After mass, in remarks in English from his studio window overlooking St. Peter's Square, jammed with tens of thousands of Romans, tourists and pilgrims, Benedict invited all to pray with him 'earnestly for peace throughout the world, for reconciliation and forgiveness in areas of conflict, and for a more just and equitable distribution of the world's resources.'
