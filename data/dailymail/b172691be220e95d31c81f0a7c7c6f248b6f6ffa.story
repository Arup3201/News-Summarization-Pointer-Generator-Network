Armed with pea shooters and slingshots, they’re the naughtiest children around.

But thanks to a visit from Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, the Beano’s terrors have been tamed. For now...

In a special edition of the comic, the pupils of Bash Street School are encouraged to grow organic vegetables by Charles to improve their inedible school meals – which goes down very well.

The Duchess of Cornwall was also immortalised in the comic when she opens the school library

In the scene, the Prince appears 
alongside Beano stalwart Plug – whose enormous ears would put most 
caricatures of Charles’s in the shade.

Meanwhile Camilla manages to convert 
Dennis the Menace into a book worm as she opens the school’s new library
 – with a little help from Gnasher who is also on his best behaviour.

The storylines in the issue, which goes on sale today, were created to reflect the Prince and Duchess’s interests.

It marks yesterday’s visit by the 
couple to the publisher of the 75-year-old comic, DC Thomson in Dundee, 
where they started the firm’s new printing press.

Beano editor Craig Graham said: ‘Often
 we’re a little bit nervous because we do, by the nature of things, have
 to caricature people. But they were both absolutely delighted with 
their likenesses.’

Charles and Camilla are not the first royals to have been featured in the Beano. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have already made cameo appearances in the publication.

The new edition, billed as a 'top 
secret guest issue', urges readers to turn the pages to find out who the
 special visitors to Beanotown are.

In
 the first cartoon strip, Dennis the Menace and Gnasher, the Duchess of 
Cornwall goes to Bash Street School to open its new library.

Dennis and Roger the Dodger are initially in typically mischievous mood, with Roger in particular carrying out a number of tricks to avoid having to read books.

But the Duchess’s visit convinces them that reading is worthwhile and has Dennis declaring: 'Reading is fun for everyone, Menaces.'

In the Bash Street Kids strip, Charles is pictured dropping into the canteen at lunchtime, where he finds the school meals to be inedible.

As a solution, he proposes that they make their own sandwiches and grow their own organic vegetables in an allotment - putting the kids’ pea shooters to good use as seed planters.

It is understood that the themes were chosen to reflect causes close to the Duke and Duchess’s hearts.

Mr Graham explained how the idea of including Charles and Camilla in the comic came about.

'When
 we learned that they were coming to open the plant, we were obviously 
thrilled, it was a great opportunity for us,' he said.

'We
 know that kids do love the royals. I think after last year, with the 
Jubilee, it’s really still at the forefront of their minds and we know 
that they really enjoy reading about them, seeing them and finding out 
what they’re doing.

'So we put our minds to thinking up a 
storyline which might fit with their (the royals’) interests and how 
they may relate to today’s kids.

'We
 know of the Duchess’s interest in literacy and most people know about 
the Duke’s interests in organic farming, healthy eating and generally 
living a very healthy lifestyle.

'We put our minds to it and came up with two storylines related to those.'

He
 also joked that he hoped the couple, who were presented with their 
prints by three young Beano readers, would put them 'on the 
mantelpiece'.

During the 
visit to DC Thomson’s base at Kingsway East, the royals met a number of 
employees, as well as members of the Thomson family.

Charles
 wore a kilt in Rothesay tartan for the visit, while Camilla donned a 
kilted skirt in Lord of the Isles tartan, with a matching mint green 
jacket.

The couiple viewed 
an exhibition of the 100-year history of the publisher behind such 
titles as The Press and Journal, The Courier and The Sunday Post, and 
some of the most popular children’s publications of all time, such as 
Bunty, Judy, The Skipper and The Hotspur.

Charles and Camilla also started the company’s new printing press, which is said to be one of the most efficient of its kind.

One of the first copies off the press, a special edition of the Evening Telegraph marking the royal visit, was presented to the couple at the end of their tour.

Following the visit, David Thomson, chief operating officer at DC Thomson, said: 'It’s been a fantastic day for the staff. We’re obviously delighted that the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay agreed to come and open our new press.

'We’re very committed to newspapers and the future of newspapers, which is why we’ve made such a huge investment, a £30 million investment, in the new plant, so that we’re able to produce the quality of newspapers for all our readers for years to come.'
