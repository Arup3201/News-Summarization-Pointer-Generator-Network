Rebekah Brooks's lawyer told the court that prosecutors have failed to stand up a case against her after seven months of evidence

Rebekah Brooks has faced ‘downright cruelty and vitriol’ during a sustained campaign to convict her of phone hacking ‘no matter what’, the Old Bailey heard yesterday.

The prosecution has failed to find a ‘smoking gun’ that proves her guilt, despite a massive police investigation with ‘untold resources dedicated to it’, her lawyer said.

Jonathan Laidlaw QC, for Brooks, said the prosecution had relied on ‘outrageous’ tactics in its desperate pursuit of a conviction, including presenting lies and misleading evidence to the jury.

In his closing speech to the jury, the lawyer launched a broadside against the publicity surrounding the former News International chief executive’s prosecution.

He said: ‘The case has been conducted against the backdrop of significant attention from the media, and attention from the media in all its modern forms.

‘Opinions have been expressed with views running from criticism and comment through inaccuracy and bias to downright cruelty and vitriol.’

During seven months of evidence, Mr Laidlaw said prosecutors had failed to prove their case against the 45-year-old, despite ‘twisting and turning’ the evidence.

At least one witness had lied in their evidence, he said, and police had misled jurors ‘to protect what is the ultimate prosecution theory in this case: Rebekah Brooks must be guilty, no matter what’.

Mr Laidlaw said the so-called ‘Trial of the Century’ had failed to show Brooks was the architect of the phone hacking scandal when she edited the News of the World, from 2000 to 2003.

Only one story had been proven to come from hacking during her editorship, about murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, and that was published while she was on holiday and her deputy Andy Coulson was in charge.

Brooks had campaigned over the protection of children after the murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne and would have been horrified by the hacking of the missing girl, Mr Laidlaw said.

The prosecution alleged Coulson, who later became David Cameron’s director of communications in Downing Street, was more likely to have told Brooks about the hack because the pair were involved in a six-year affair.

But Mr Laidlaw said a 2004 love letter in which Brooks spoke of waiting for Coulson for six years did not prove their clandestine relationship lasted for that time, and said there was no telephone contact between them during Brooks’ holiday until after the Dowler messages were hacked.

He accused the prosecution of being ‘desperate’ to link the notorious hacking episode to Brooks and said once she moved to the Sun she and Coulson were rival editors, adding: ‘Lovers they may have been, but no love was lost between their papers.’

The News of the World’s £92,000-a-year private detective Glenn Mulcaire was given 550 ‘taskings’ during her editorship but was only proved to have been asked to hack 12 times.

Four news desk editors have admitted their part in a phone hacking conspiracy with Mulcaire and Mr Laidlaw said the prosecution case was that Brooks must have known and sanctioned the plot.

But the hacking only became ‘prolific’ after she left and Mulcaire’s contract with the newspaper only stipulated ‘research and information’ services, Mr Laidlaw said.

She left the News of the World in 2003 to become editor of The Sun and her lawyer questioned why there had been no evidence of hacking at The Sun if it was a practice its new editor knew of and approved.

Mr Laidlaw said prosecutor Andrew Edis QC had pursued an attitude of ‘theory first, evidence later’ to convict Brooks at any cost said the jury might have expected to hear more direct evidence, rather than theories.

He said: ‘You must have been expecting him to have laid out for you a whole mass of evidence, a welter of material the police had discovered as a result of a massive inquiry with untold resources directed to it.

‘You must have been expecting a mass of material to demonstrate that Mrs Brooks was the architect of phone hacking at the News of the World. That was not the case.’

Mr Laidlaw said the prosecution had called a witness, Eimear Cook, the ex-wife of golfer Colin Montgomerie, who had been caught out lying in her evidence.

The jury has heard she claimed Brooks told her about an episode when she was arrested for an alleged assault on her ex-husband, EastEnders actor Ross Kemp, when the arrest actually happened months after Mrs Cook met Brooks.

The trial has now entered its final phase, with lawyers for each of the seven defendants giving speeches on their behalf and the jury is expected to be sent out to consider verdicts next month (June).

Brooks and Coulson, 46, both deny conspiring to hack phones and conspiring with others to commit misconduct by making illegal payments to public officials.

Brooks also denies conspiring to pervert the course of justice. All seven defendants deny all the charges against them.

The trial continues.
