Ukraine's 'Human Barbie' has heeded a call from Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin to fill Crimea's near-empty beaches.

Model Valeria Lukyanova, 28, from Ukraine, proudly posed in the Black Sea peninsula which has been boycotted by millions of tourists since the Kremlin's annexation of the region from Ukraine.

'Here I am in Yalta - hooray,' she boasted to her social media followers.

The show of support for Russia comes as the Kiev government claimed police have found a mass grave containing 52 corpses in a Ukrainian city formerly occupied by pro-Russian rebels.

Valeria Lukyanova, 28, from Ukraine, has heeded a call from Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin to fill Crimea's near-empty beaches as she proudly posed in the Black Sea peninsula

The world famous 'Human Barbie' lives in strife-torn Ukraine - in Odessa - but has recently shown her strong support for Russia

The find is in addition to the earlier discovery of 14 bodies, claimed Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko.

'Police have interrogated a man who was burying the bodies on the order of terrorists,' he said.

'He pointed at a mass grave where 52 bodies were buried, but this is not all. Many bodies were buried here and there. We are working at locating all the bodies.' 

'Human Barbie' Lukyanova lives in strife-torn Ukraine - in Odessa - but has recently shown her strong support for Russia.

For example, she told GQ magazine: 'I tend to cut off anything I don't need. The next step is to cut off Ukraine entirely, because all I get here is s***. Why waste myself on this?'

Her picture in the resort of Yalta will warm the heart of Putin, who is trying strong arm tactics to get Russian tourists to Crimea to save its flagging tourist industry.

State bodies are even under orders to send their employees on subsidised breaks to the peninsula.

But unlike Lukyanova, millions of Ukrainians are giving Crimea a miss this year following Putin's audacious March occupation.

Lukyanova prides herself on her similarity to the Mattel doll, helped by her attachment to 'Breatharianism', which means surviving on 'cosmic micro-food', otherwise known as air and light.

'In recent weeks I have not been hungry at all. I'm hoping it's the final stage before I can subsist on air and light alone,' she said earlier this year.

She complained about the huge queues at border checkpoints from mainland Ukraine into Crimea, an ex-Soviet holiday paradise which has seen a cut in its annual six million tourists this summer following the Kremlin takeover.

Last week the local capital Simferopol's airport welcomed its one millionth arrival of the season, but she arrived by road, across an unofficial border where poor relations between Ukraine and Russia lead to interminable delays.

'We went to the Crimea and the queue at customs was unreal. In four hours we moved 100 metres and there was an endless line in front,' she complained.

Lukyanova, whose grandfather was from Siberia in Russia, was visiting her mother Irina Pashkeeva, 47, who lives in Crimea.

Irina is a strong advocate of other regions in southern and eastern Ukraine joining Russia.

Her social media site contains this appeal to pro-Russians: 'Do not give up! fight! Our grandfathers fought with bare hands against the fascists! Do not disgrace the honour of the Great Warrior! Be aware that Russia is always with you!'

It reads: 'It's now or never! The Junta in Kiev has declared a war on us. There are armed mercenaries throughout southeastern Ukraine.'

Lukyanova's mother also supports a controversial group called 'Ukraine Doesn't Exist Any More'. 

Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said some 300 people are missing in Donetsk region, including the 'victims' of pro-Russian 'terrorists' and fighters from Russia who came to Ukraine as mercenaries

Russia is waging a campaign to persuade its people to holiday in Crimea after annexing the territory in spring.

Putin has been accused of turning into a travel agency with menaces by preventing many officials in security agencies and the police from going abroad for holidays.

Many have been told to travel to the Crimea instead.

Tourist chiefs have recently claimed many more Russians are coming to the peninsula's Black Sea beaches after a lacklustre start to the season.

Meanwhile, police have found a mass grave containing 52 corpses in a Ukrainian city formerly occupied by pro-Russian rebels, the Kiev government has claimed. The find is in addition to the earlier discovery of 14 bodies, claimed Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko.

Some 300 people are missing in Donetsk region, including the 'victims' of pro-Russian 'terrorists' and fighters from Russia who came to Ukraine as mercenaries, Gerashchenko said.

He claimed that the burials were undertaken in Slavyansk on the orders of controversial rebel commander Igor Strelkov, aka Igor Girkin, who wanted a monument to the defenders of Novorossiya, the area of eastern Ukraine that rebels claim should be part of Russia.

'A different monument will be erected there - to the victims of Putin's terrorism and of those terrorists he brought here,' said Gerashchenko.

The identities of the latest victims are not known, but among the mass grave of 14, found earlier, were worshippers at a local protestant church, he said.

One was a priest and his two sons who had helped people flee the city when it was under the grip of rebels.

Another was a father of eight, named Vladimir Velichko. A third victim was named as Viktor Brodarsky, a father of three.

'We are ready to arrange for DNA samples for residents of the Russian Federation who know that their relatives travelled to the so-called Novorossiya and did not come back,' he said.

They would be able in this way 'to find out whether their relatives could be buried in graves around Slavyansk and other Ukrainian cities'.

The EU is to approve new sanctions against Russia today over the Ukraine crisis.

This comes amid fears that human remains still at the MH17 crash site in Donetsk region may never be collected amid nearby fighting between rebels and the Ukrainian army.

'It's absolutely unconscionable that they remain out there,' said Michael Bociurkiw, a spokesman for monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).

Some remains may never be recovered, admit Dutch investigators.

'I believe the chances are not very good that we will get it all,' said Dutch police chief Gerard Bouman.

Strelkov today claimed a 'rapid increase' in the number of Ukrainian army soldiers who are surrendering.

'I order all commanders and fighters of the Donetsk People's Republic's militia forces not to open fire on groups or solitary servicemen of the Ukrainian Armed Forces who raise a white flag or make their intent to surrender known in a different way,' he said. 

Local officials have today said intense fighting between Ukrainian troops and pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine killed at least 19 civilians.

Ukrainian forces have been pushing rebel units back towards their two main urban strongholds of Donetsk and Luhansk and have sought to encircle them in several places, including in the wider area where MH17 crashed on July 17.

Officials said 14 people, including five children, were killed in fighting on Monday evening in the town of Horlivka, one of several spots that saw fierce battles between the rival forces in the last few days.

In the city of Luhansk, officials said five civilians were killed when shelling hit a retirement home. 

'The enemy is throwing everything it has into the battle to complete encirclement of the DNR,' rebel commander Igor Strelkov told journalists in Donetsk on Monday evening, referring to the self-proclaimed 'Donetsk People's Republic'.

'We were astonished by how much amour they threw into this battle,' said Strelkov, a Russian national, sporting a camouflage T-shirt and trousers.

A rebel source in Donetsk said reinforcements including military equipment and fighters had crossed the nearby border with Russia into Ukraine. Reuters was not able to confirm that independently.

Rebel leaders insist publicly that Moscow is not supplying them. Russia also denies Western accusations that it is supporting the rebellion with arms and troops. 

The rebels say 7,400 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed or injured since Kiev launched what it calls its 'anti-terrorist' operation against separatists in the east in early May. Kiev puts the toll at fewer than 1,500.
