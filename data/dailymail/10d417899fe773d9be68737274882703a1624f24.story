Spelman College in Atlanta has suspended a prestigious endowed professorship in Bill Cosby's name following a string of sexual assault allegations against him, it today emerged.

The historically black women's college created the William and Camille Olivia Hanks Cosby Endowed Professorship after receiving a $20million gift from the 77-year-old comedian in 1988.

But now, it has indefinitely suspended the star's chair, saying that it can no longer 'meet its objectives' to enhance the 133-year-old school's intellectual, cultural and creative life.

Decision: But now, it has indefinitely suspended the star's chair, saying it can no longer 'meet its objectives' to enhance the school's intellectual, cultural and creative life. Above, a statement on the school's website

In a statement on its website on Sunday, Spelman said: 'The William and Camille Olivia Hanks Cosby Endowed Professorship was established to bring positive attention and accomplished visiting scholars to Spelman College in order to enhance our intellectual, cultural and creative life.

'The current context prevents us from continuing to meet these objectives fully. Consequently, we will suspend the program until such time that the original goals can again be met.'

The statement did not address whether the college will change the name of the Camille Olivia Hanks Cosby, Ed.D. Academic Center, which houses the Spelman College Museum of Fine Art.

It comes as an increasing number of women are stepping forward to claim Cosby drugged and sexually abused them in decades past. The entertainer has denied the allegations via his lawyers.

Cosby, who gave the commencement address at Spelman in 2006, made history with his $20million gift to the school, which was the single largest donation ever given to a historically black institution.

In addition to funding the endowed chair, the comedian and his wife, Camille, helped build the Cosby Center on campus - and their daughter, Evin, even attended the college for two years.

Spelman, founded in 1881 in Georgia's capital, is also the alma mater of Keshia Knight Pulliam, who played Cosby's - Cliff Huxtable's - youngest daughter, Rudy Huxtable, on 'The Cosby Show'.

On Sunday, Spelman graduate, Pearl Cleage, an award-winning novelist and playwright and former Cosby Chair, said she believed the school made the right move in suspending the professorship.

Speaking to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, she said: 'In light of the current accusations against Mr. Cosby, it’s appropriate to suspend the chair while the college reevaluates the relationship with Mr. Cosby, moving forward.' The Chair has also held by acclaimed author, Tanarive Due.

The decision follows online protests by many Spelman students, who have criticized Cosby's links with the college by using the Twitter hashtag #NotMyFather, referring to the star's TV persona.

It also follows Cosby's resignation from the board of trustees of his beloved Temple University, an act which he says was made in the 'best interests of the university and its students'. 

The University of Massachusetts Amherst, where Cosby got his graduate degrees, also recently said it had asked him to step down as honorary co-chairman of its $300 million fundraising campaign.

And the Berklee College of Music will reportedly no longer award a scholarship in his name. 

Dozens of women have come forward to claim that they were sexually assaulted by the comedian, who has been with his wife  for the last 51 years. Many  have a similar story of being slipped a pill.

Coming forward: Last week, super model Beverly Johnson (pictured), claimed that Cosby drugged her in the 1980s during an audition for 'The Cosby Show'. She said she managed to get away without being raped

On Sunday, Cosby, who has never been charged over the mounting rape claims, said he expected only the 'black media' to stay 'neutral' and give him a fair hearing over the allegations.

Speaking to the New York Post's Page Six, the star said that African-American media should be impartial in reporting the allegations that he is a serial rapist. 

'Let me say this. I only expect the black media to uphold the standards of excellence in journalism and when you do that you have to go in with a neutral mind,' he said. 

Alleged victim: Cosby's legal team have hit out against some of his accusers, particularly former supermodel Janice Dickinson (pictured), who repeatedly called him a rapist in a CNN interview

He also praised his wife's 'love and strength'. When asked by the reporter how she was coping he said: 'Love and the strength of womanhood.' He then repeated the phrase twice more. 

Cosby's legal team have hit out against some of his accusers, particularly former supermodel Janice Dickinson, who repeatedly called him a rapist in a televised interview with CNN.

Dickinson also used the appearance to address Cosby's wife - whom she said she pitied for having a rapist husband.

She said: 'I feel bad for her. She knew that he was promiscuous. She stayed married to him. This is her choice, I can't speak for her.

'I can only say to Mrs Cosby that I am sorry I had sex with your husband and he had raped me. I'm sorry that he raped me.

'I'm sorry for you that your husband gave me wine and pills - with the sole intent of having sex with me and raping me.

'I'm sorry for her husband was a philanderer and is rapist, I really mean that, and for his children.' 

Last week, super model Beverly Johnson, stepped forward to claim Cosby drugged her in the 1980s during an audition for 'The Cosby Show'. She said she managed to get away without being raped.

Choreographer Aku Kadogo, who is the current the Cosby Endowed Professor, is now listed as 'a Spelman College Distinguished Visiting Scholar for 2014-2015' on the college's website.

The list of all the scholars to have been previously awarded the professorship has been removed.
