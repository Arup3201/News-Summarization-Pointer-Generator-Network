Greek shipping tycoon Demetri Marchessini, pictured wearing trousers at his home in London

A wealthy new backer of the UK Independence Party claims women who wear trousers are 'deliberately’ making themselves unattractive to men.

Greek tycoon Demetri Marchessini, who believes not wearing a skirt is ‘hostile behaviour’, gave UKIP £10,000 this year - a fifth of all its cash donations.

But the parlous state of the party’s finances has forced officials to issue a begging letter to supporters for money – and policies.

The surge in interest and support for Nigel Farage’s anti-EU has not been matched in its bank balance.

Mr
 Farage's attempts to win support in Scotland backfired yesterday, when 
an angry protest in Edinburgh forced him to take refuge in a pub before 
being escorted to safety by police.

Mr
 Marchessini gave UKIP £5,000 in February and another £5,000 in March, 
as the party prepared for local elections which saw it take almost one 
in four votes cast.

But Mr Marchessini’s views on women – and what they wear –are likely to raise eyebrows.

He
 is the author of a book entitled Women In Trousers: A Rear View in 
which he photographed women from behind and then commented on their 
clothes. In it he claimed that the ratio Britain of women wearing 
trousers to skirts is 10 to 1.

‘The interesting thing about this 
phenomenon is that, because women cannot see themselves from the rear, 
the vast majority of women are unaware that trousers are very 
unflattering to them,’ he said in the 2003 book.

'Trousers are made for men's bodies, which are mostly straight up and down.

'Women's bodies on the other hand consists of curves. Women have big bottoms - they are meant to have big bottoms.

Jennifer Lopez, pictured wearing trousers in New York this week, was once branded a 'Mexican tart' by the businessman

'Countless women who would look lovely in dresses or skirts are embarrassingly unattractive in trousers.’

He warned that Britain had a high 
divorce rate and low marriage rate, and suggested women were not helping
 their chances of finding a husband by wearing trousers.

‘The
 more women dress like men, the less they are attractive to men. If a 
man finds a woman attractive, he will find her legs sexy even if they 
are not perfect, simply because they are her legs.

‘Women know that men don't like trousers, yet they deliberately wear them,’ he continued in the bizarre coffee table book.

'Walk
 along any street and you see women using trousers like a uniform every 
single day. This is hostile behaviour - they are deliberately dressing 
in a way that is opposite to what men would like.

'It is behaviour that flies against commons sense, and also flies against the normal human desire to please.’

In an interview plugging the book, he was asked if was pleased at the rise of curvy stars like Jennifer Lopez. But Mr Marchessini he told The Guardian: 'She looks like a Mexican tart'.

At the launch of the book his ex wife Lucinda told reporters: 'He is deeply sexist.'

According to records from the Electoral Commission, Mr Marchessini’s two donations to UKIP are the first time the 78-year-old has given money to a political party.

Latest figures show that in the first quarter of 2013 it received a total of £74,150, of which just £47,000 was in cash.

By comparison both Labour and the 
Tories were given £3.7million, the Lib Dems received £842,710  and even 
the Socialist Party had a donation of £295,775.

UKIP has now launched a drive to find more people to do the same. A begging letter sent to supporters highlights a lack of money, staff and policies.

Treasurer Stuart Wheeler complains that recent boosts in opinion polls have ‘disappointingly, not yet resulted in a surge of donations’.

He reveals the party has set up a separate campaign account for the 2014v European Parliament election to attract backers who want to take a tougher line on Europe, but fear a strong UKIP showing at the 2015 election could cost the Tories support and allow Ed Miliband to form a Labour government.

Mr Wheeler said it was becoming a priority ‘to hire some very good people to fill several roles’.

‘Above all, we have got to improve our policy production. For one thing the other parties will be attacking us on policy and we need to be quite clear what our ripostes are,’ the letter added, according to The Times.
