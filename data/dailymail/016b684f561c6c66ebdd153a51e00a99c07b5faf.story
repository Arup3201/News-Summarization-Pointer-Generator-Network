With the Scottish independence referendum just five days away, one of the country's most famous citizens has finally had his say on the vote.

Groundskeeper Willie, the beloved Simpsons character, has revealed that he supports a Yes vote in Thursday's poll - and has offered to become the first leader of an independent Scotland.

The groundskeeper, who is portrayed as an exaggerated version of a stereotypical Scot, said in a campaign video that he intended to 'stand in the proud tradition of William Wallace and Andy Murray'.

However, unfortunately for Willie, as a resident of the US he would be unable to vote in the referendum.

He's a Yes: Groundskeeper Willie from The Simpsons has come out in support of Scottish independence

The last-minute intervention was posted on YouTube by an official Fox account, and features Willie dressed in a kilt standing in front of a saltire flag.

In the satirical clip, he portrays the debate as being between 'the freedom-loving heirs of the Highland tradition, and those who enjoy crawling like worms beneath British boots'.

Willie adds: 'I am hesitant to throw my support to either side - be it the right one, or the obviously wrong one.'

He goes on to praise the merits of an independent Scotland, pointing out in particular its whisky industry and oil reserves in the North Sea.

The video then takes a surreal turn as Willie ponders Scotland's future - and suggests that he is a better choice for the country's leader than the 'safe choice' Alex Salmond.

He says: 'For a leader who can stand in the proud tradition of William Wallace and Andy Murray, won't you consider the return of Scotland's prodigal son - Groundskeeper Willie?

'Willie won't back down to world leaders, because I haven't a clue who they are and I'm not willing to learn.

'I've lived in America most of my life, so I've seen first hand how not to run a country.'

He then rips off a shirt and reveals that 'Aye or die' is written on his chest, exclaiming: 'That's not a tattoo, it's a birthmark!'

The video was released ahead of the forthcoming 26th episode of The Simpsons, which is broadcast on Sky 1 in the UK.

Groundskeeper Willie is just the latest in a string of expat Scots to endorse independence - actor Alan Cumming, who lives in New York, and Caribbean-based Sean Connery are both keen advocates of a Yes vote, even though as foreign residents neither of them is eligible to cast a ballot.

Other fictional characters to have spoken out have opposed independence - when asked about the referendum, Shrek star Mike Myers said 'Shrek wants what the will of the Scottish people want,' adding: 'I love Scotland. I hope they remain part of Britain.'

And Kermit the Frog said earlier this year that he backed David Bowie's call for Scotland to remain the Union, but that Miss Piggy was keen on independence so she can make a bid to become Queen.
