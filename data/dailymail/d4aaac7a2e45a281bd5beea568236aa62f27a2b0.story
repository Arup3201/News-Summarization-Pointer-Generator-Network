Barack Obama shows absolutely no mercy to his enemies when it comes to war - as long as they are flies.

This photograph shows the President using a magazine to swat a pesky fly in the Oval Office as his aides laugh around him.

The photo of Obama as Lord of the Flies was released as part of an inside look at a year in the life of the President of the United States.

However, this is not the first time the President has been caught on camera battling pesky airborne pests.

In January 2013 President Obama was visibly bothered when a fly landed between his eyes during a speech in the State Dining Room of the White House.

Four years earlier, in 2009, the President famously killed a fly during an interview with CNBC at the White House.

'Get out of here,' Obama said as the fly buzzed him during his interview. The pest persisted, and when it landed on his left forearm, Obama smacked it.

'Now, where were we?' the president said without missing a beat.

The photograph of Obama's battle with the fly in 2014 is part of the White House's annual picture roundup.

The  photographic look back at the year that was proves that it has been a hectic 12 months for President Obama and those closest to him.

The photographs show the President meeting foreign dignitaries and key figures at home, but also his encounters with regular Americans.

One snap depicts the cheerful hug between Obama and Dallas nurse Nina Pham after she was declared Ebola-free.

Another shows the President holding a basketball while talking to a group of mentees who had participated in a session in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. 

As the meeting was coming to a close one of the participants challenged the President to a game of HORSE on the basketball court on the South Lawn. 

In addition to the shooting competition, the President also used the opportunity to further talk to the young men about life lessons, not basketball.

There are also images of the First Family on their official visits abroad, including the President in Australia and the First Lady, Sasha and Malia in China. 

On the celebrity front, there are appearances from Bill Murray, Brad Paisley and one late night encounter with Vice President Joe Biden and another Veep, Julia Louis-Dreyfus. 

Then there are the photos of some younger Americans, one little lady who looks on in awe as her father shakes the hand of President Obama, and one young son of a Secret Service member who takes a chance to face plant on the couch in the Oval Office.

More than anything however, there are plenty of photos of President Obama and his biggest, and most trusted supporter, wife Michelle. 

Selected by chief White House photographer Pete Souza, the images come from both him and his staff, composed of: Amanda Lucidon, David Lienemann, Chuck Kennedy, and Lawrence Jackson.
