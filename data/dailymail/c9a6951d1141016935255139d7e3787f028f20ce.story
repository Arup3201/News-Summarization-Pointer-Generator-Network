They have not seen their hero on TV since the end of the last series six months ago – but Doctor Who fans have a special treat to look forward to when the show returns.

Three Time Lords will line up together in a hotly anticipated 50th anniversary special on November 23.

BBC bosses last night unveiled a trailer of the episode, entitled The Day Of The Doctor, showing the current Doctor Matt Smith alongside his predecessor David Tennant and the so-called ‘Dark Doctor’ played by veteran star John Hurt.

Exciting: Producer Steven Moffat said Tennant and Smith bounded around while Hurt stole scenes with one look

The anniversary show will be one of the final appearances for Smith, 31, who is to be replaced in the role by The Thick Of It star Peter Capaldi after the Christmas special. Tennant, 42, returns after leaving the show in 2010.

Mystery surrounds the character played by Hurt, 73. Doctor Who producer Steven Moffat suggested he would play an older, meaner incarnation of the Time Lord.

He said: ‘It looks like somehow he’s been through it a bit.

‘This isn’t a Doctor who’s just appeared – he’s been around, he’s been in this form for a while.’ 

The episode also sees the return of Billie Piper as the Doctor’s companion Rose.

Viewers will see her eyes flash spookily – a reference to a previous storyline that saw her gain godlike powers and which show insiders say is a ‘never-before-seen twist’.

Moffat heaped praise on Hurt’s scene-stealing performance alongside the two younger Doctors. #

He said: ‘You’d have David and Matt 
leaping around the set and doing every form of physical comedy with each
other, and then John Hurt would come along, do this tiny movement with 
his eyes and you go, “That’s it, he’s got the scene now, hasn’t he?” ’

The trailer was inadvertently posted on the BBC Spain Facebook page ahead of its intended debut at 8pm yesterday.

The end of an era: The episode will air on November 23rd, on television as well as in over 200 UK cinemas

It remained online for 30 minutes before being taken down after excited fans began sharing the link on social networks.

Show bosses then uploaded it to the official website.

Eagle-eyed fans quickly identified scenes showing the Doctor’s home planet Gallifrey under attack.

They began to speculate whether the episode will finally show scenes of The Last Great Time War, which has been regularly been referred but  never actually seen.

The Doctor Who 50th anniversary episode will air simultaneously around the world.
