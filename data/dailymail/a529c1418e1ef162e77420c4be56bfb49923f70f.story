Thousands of cancer patients could lose out when the Government’s special drugs fund for England is wound up next year, claim doctors.

Four out of five specialists say access to cancer medicines will revert to being the worst in Europe, with more than 16,000 patients a year being denied help.

A survey found they have been able to prescribe up to 35 extra drugs as a result of the fund.

Cancer charities are calling for the Government to pledge it will not go back to the ‘dark days’ – depriving patients of life-prolonging drugs on the NHS – by confirming the fund will continue beyond March 2014.

A survey of 200 English oncologists found 82 per cent feel the end of the Cancer Drugs Fund will mean access to cancer medicines in England will be worse than the rest of Europe. Posed by models

The £200million-a-year fund, which began in April 2011, has led to 25,000 patients in England gaining access to drugs ruled out  on the NHS by rationing body Nice.

They are five times more likely to be given a new drug than patients in Wales and three times more likely than Scottish patients.

The Government’s aim, which was a Tory election pledge, was to enable NHS doctors to prescribe any drug if they believed a cancer patient could benefit.

But it was a temporary stop-gap for three years, until a new method of assessment for drug pricing is brought in next year.

However, MPs on the health select committee complained there was no certainty about the future for drug pricing – or the Cancer Drugs Fund.

Commissioned by cancer drug manufacturer Roche, the survey found oncologists gained access to 35 additional drugs as a result of the fund

A survey of 200 English oncologists found 82 per cent feel the end of the CDF will mean access to cancer medicines in England will be worse than the rest of Europe.

Three quarters are calling for future funding to ensure patients do not lose out.

The survey found oncologists gained access to 35 additional drugs as a result of the fund.

Commissioned by cancer drug  manufacturer Roche, the survey was carried out independently by research firm Adelphi.

Almost two thirds of cancer treatments considered by Nice (the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) are rejected.

It is estimated that ending the CDF will deny more than 16,000 patients annually from receiving potentially life-extending drugs.

Andrew Wilson, chief executive of the Rarer Cancers Foundation, insisted the fund had been highly successful.

He said: ‘There is evidence that patients getting drugs this way are still alive today who might not have been, and it appears not to have increased the cancer drugs bill.

‘The CDF has provided many of these patients with access to treatment options that were not previously available to them

‘There is a risk that access to treatment will go backwards, returning us to the dark days of cancer drugs being denied to the patients who need them.’

Health minister Lord Howe said: ‘We will ensure arrangements are in place to protect individual patients who are receiving treatment with drugs funded by the Cancer Drugs Fund as the end of the fund approaches.’
