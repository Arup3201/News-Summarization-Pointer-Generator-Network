The average FTSE 100 boss earned more money by 9am today than a typical British worker will earn this year, a report reveals today.

On a day dubbed ‘Fat Cat Wednesday’, the report warned there is ‘clearly something wrong’ with the excesses of executive pay in this country.

On average, chief executives in the FTSE index of Britain’s 100 biggest public companies earn a total pay package of £4.3million, including their salary and bonus.

Intense: Chief executives earn an average of £4.3million a year, which beats £26,500 in just two days

By comparison, the average worker with a full-time job earns £26,500, according to the report from the High Pay Centre, an independent think-tank.

It calculates the boss is earning around £1,100 per hour, based on ‘generous’ assumptions that they work 12-hour days, work three in four weekends and take only 10 days’ holiday a year.

As a result, Britain’s elite band of chief executives will have earned more money by 9am today after just two days’ back at their desk following their Christmas holiday than an ordinary worker takes a whole year to earn.

Deborah Hargreaves, director of the High Pay Centre, said: ‘Fat Cat Wednesday highlights how insensitive big company executives have become.

‘When top bosses take home more in two and a half days than the average worker earns in a year, there is clearly something wrong with the way pay is set for both bosses and workers.’

Executive pay remains a hugely controversial subject in this country, with no sign that the recent financial crisis has restrained the gold-plated excesses of the boardrooms.

Lord Oakeshott blasts the figures as 'market failure', saying creators, not managers should earn more

Between 2011 and 2012, for example, the average pay package received by a FTSE 100 chief executive jumped by around £400,000, according to the report.

Lord Oakeshott, a leading Lib Dem peer, slammed the huge gulf between executive pay and the pay of ordinary workers, who have suffered the longest pay squeeze in history.

Lord Oakeshott said: ‘This must be market failure.

‘When the average big company boss – mediocre or worse as well as the best – collects more in a few days than his staff get in a whole year.

‘Most of them are not risk-taking entrepreneurs who have founded and built a business. Creators, not managers, deserve the really big rewards.’

Last week, it emerged Ross McEwan, chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, had been handed £1.5million in free shares on top of his ‘basic’ salary of £1million.

Mr McEwan, who has promised not to sell any RBS shares while he remains chief executive, was given them to persuade him to leave his former employer, Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton has spoken of his ‘completely out of body experiences’ when negotiating bankers’ pay packages at the State-owned bank.

Some were ‘absolutely outraged’ that they earned only £4million a year when a rival at another bank earns £6million to do the same job, he said.

Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: ‘Soaring pay inequality, with top bosses now taking home more in a few days than most workers earn in a year, is damaging our economy.

‘Workers need better pay rises so that the recovery is built on growing incomes, rather than falling savings and mounting household debts.

‘But Britain’s fat cat bosses are hoarding earnings owed to staff for shareholders and themselves.’
