Tiny sponges could be the unlikely key to saving the victims of gunshot wounds.

Researchers have developed a small syringe that can simply be injected into the would.

The team behind it say it could save dozens of lives, as it can seal the wound within fifteen seconds.

The Xstat, a small syringe of expandable sponges that can simply be injected into a gunshot would to seal it.

The key to the system is a specially developed syringe.

It can inject dozens of small sponges into the wound.

The sponges are coated in a clotting agent and compressed.

In the wound, the Xstat sponges expand and create a barrier to blood flow, present a large surface area for clotting.

They also provide gentle pressure, freeing up medical staff.

'XStat works by applying a group of small, rapidly-expanding sponges into a wound cavity using a lightweight applicator,' RevMedX, the firm behind the gadget, said.

'In the wound, the Xstat sponges expand and create a barrier to blood flow, present a large surface area for clotting, and provide gentle pressure.

No direct manual pressure is required.

Two applicator sizes are under development: a 30 mm diameter applicator for larger wounds and a 12 mm diameter applicator for narrow wound tracks.

The XStat sponges are made from standard medical sponge that is coated with a hemostatic agent and compressed.

The invention already has fans in the US Army.

Two applicator sizes are under development: a 30 mm diameter applicator for larger wounds and a 12 mm diameter applicator for narrow wound tracks.

'Hemorrhage is the leading cause of death on the battlefield, and one of our most challenging forms of hemorrhage has been junctional [the junction of the legs or arms with the torso] hemorrhage, or hemorrhage from deep wounds on which it is impossible to put a tourniquet or apply manual compression externally, said Dr. Anthony Pusateri, portfolio manager of the Department of Defense Hemorrhage and Resuscitation Research and Development Program.

'This XSTAT device allows the haemostatic material to be put [injected] into the wound tract, and then it expands from the inside out, putting pressure on the bleeding to stop it,' said Pusateri.

'It is a capability that has never existed before, and can be used in the field setting by medics, possibly even with buddy aid [first aid administered by battlefield 'battle buddies'].'

How it works: 'XStat works by applying a group of small, rapidly-expanding sponges into a wound cavity using a lightweight applicator,' RevMedX, the firm behind the gadget, said.

'This project started with the United States Special Operations Command,' he said.

'The research looked promising enough that the Army chose to fund it through its completion.'

Pusateri said that he expects that units will be able to purchase the device for themselves.

He also believes that the XSTAT device will transcend military medical use and find its way into the field of civilian medicine for widespread public use in trauma scenarios.
