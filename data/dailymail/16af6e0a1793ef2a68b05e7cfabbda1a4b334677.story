Federal Government politicians will still be allowed to keep staff related to them employed, after legal advice ruled a decision by Tony Abbott for them to be sacked was unlawful.

In November, Mr Abbott brought in tougher legislation to prevent MPs taking advantage of tax-funded entitlements, such as nepotism in the workplace, instructing them to sack their wives, in-laws and children.

But the announcement and its immediate introduction sparked a revolt from both sides of the political chamber, with Liberal and Labor MPs defending the employment of their relatives based on their competency and experience.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has relaxed the laws on MP entitlements, including a decision to allow relatives of politicians to continue working for them

Faced with legal advice that the relatives would have a strong case to sue for unlawful dismissal, the government has now relaxed the law and agreed to let those who where employed before January stay. Any wife, child or in-law employed since, however, will not be entitled to remain in full time employment.

Liberal Senator Ian Macdonald, whose wife has worked in his Canberra office for 24 years, told the Courier Mail he had given the Prime Minister a serving over the decision.

'I made my views known very forcefully to Mr Abbott. As I said to him, my wife has worked with me in Canberra for the last 24 years,’' he said.

'She’s going to continue to do that because I need her.'

He is just one of 14 MPs in similar situations who have had a hand in decrying Prime Minister Abbott's edict. The new rules would have also forced West Australian Liberal MP Don Randall, who was caught up in the entitlements saga, to sack his daughter Tess and WA Labor Senator Glenn Sterle said he had no intention of sacking his wife, Fiona.

Tony Abbott's daughter Frances received a scholarship to a prestigious school, leading many to think it was the result of a gesture from one friend to another

'I won't be sacking any of my staff,'' he said.

Even the politician responsible for policing the new rule, Special Minister of State Michael Ronaldson, previously employed his son Jack.

Meanwhile, the decision to relax the law comes just a week after the PM came under fire for his daughter Frances Abbott's $60,000 scholarship at a prestigious arts school, awarded by a long-time friend of Mr Abbott.

Ms Abbott, 22, accepted a 'chairman's scholarship' for her Bachelor of Design course from the Whitehouse Institute of Design, where Liberal supporter Les Taylor sits as chairman on the board of governors.

Mr Abbott has known the Institute's chairman Mr Taylor for many years, the Prime Minister's office said, but a spokesperson for Mr Abbott said he did not need to declare it  on his pecuniary register because it was not considered a gift.

Under the statement of Registrable Interests, a scholarship is not a gift it is an award based on merit and disclosure is not required,' the spokesperson said.
