These are the brazen images of James 'Whitey' Bulger visiting his old haunt Alcatraz - just weeks into his 16-year run from the FBI.

One picture, taken around 1995, shows the most wanted gangster smiling with his 'moll' Teresa Stanley on a tour of the notorious prison where Whitey was incarcerated from 1959 to 1963.

In one incredible image Bulger
and Stanley even donned prison stripes outside 'The Rock' for a souvenir snap, both stencilled 'Property of 
Alcatraz.'

The candid holiday snaps - which show the pair visiting Britain's Tower of London, dining in Paris and posing with the Stanley Cup - will embarrass the FBI who for years have been criticised for not trying hard enough to catch Bulger.

The Alcatraz pictures are thought to have been taken in January 1995, just weeks after he fled Boston on a tip off that the FBI were about to arrest him. 

The family friend who provided the pictures to the New York Post said the fugitive pair took time out from dodging the law to visit the site of Bulger's previous imprisonment almost 40 years before.

The law finally caught up with him 
last week when the now 81-year-old and his long-term girlfriend 
Catherine Greig were arrested in Santa Monica.

Bulger
 is charged with 19 murders, extortion, money laundering and other 
crimes; if convicted, he faces life in prison or the death penalty.

The incredible images from Alcatraz show just how confident he was about not getting caught.

They will lead many to speculate how he may have gone to visit his old cell, where he was locked up for four years on federal armed robbery charges.

Wanted and on the run, Whitey became a master of evasion by adopting an unassuming lifestyle, limiting his social contact
 to small talk and adhering to a code of silence from the mob life he 
left behind.

When federal agents tracked him to his lair last week, it 
was only after targeting the one part of his past that Bulger didn't 
leave behind -  his girlfriend Catherine.

By all 
accounts, the two did little to ever arouse suspicion, posing as two 
retirees holed up in a bland white 1970s apartment complex in Santa 
Monica amid other buildings of the same era.

Although Bulger was believed to have 
millions of dollars stashed in secret accounts, and investigators found 
$800,000 hidden in the apartment, the couple didn't live lavishly.

They 
paid $1,145 cash several days in advance each month for a 
rent-controlled unit, while newer neighbours paid more than twice as 
much. Greig shopped at a 99-cent store.

Occasionally, they splurged, even while remaining discreet.

Andrew
 Turner, the general manager of Michael's, recognised pictures of the 
fugitives this week as the couple who dined occasionally at table No 23
 at the upscale institution.

He had a record of them paying their $190 
tab in cash for a meal that included Grey Goose vodka cocktails, foie 
gras, steak and lobster, topped off by wine, in September 2009 - the 
month Bulger turned 80.

The couple kept to themselves and were 
unassuming, Turner recalled.

'This guy was just nice, mild and meek, milquetoast in a little apartment in Santa Monica,' said Bill Keefer, a 
retired U.S. marshal who supervised the witness protection program in 
Los Angeles, Hawaii and Long Island, New York.

'This guy should have been a 
supervisor with the marshal's witness protection programme. He did an 
outstanding job, the louse.'

Neighbours of the couple said they stuck close to home.

Greig was
 the more outgoing of the two while Bulger was sometimes cranky and 
reclusive. Barbara Gluck, a tenant down the hall, described Greig as 
sweet and lovely, Bulger not so.

'It was like she was hanging on to a time-bomb,' Gluck said. 'At one point, she said, "he has a rage issue".'

Others said the couple went out of their way to ingratiate themselves while also maintaining a distance.

'They were good neighbours,' said Catalina Schlank, 88. 'I will miss them.'

Bulger's
 wealth helped him maintain independence from family or former criminal 
allies who might have given away his location, said retired FBI agent 
Scott Bakken, who worked the Bulger case for a short time in 2002.

'Here you have somebody who is far more 
sophisticated than some 18-year-old who killed someone in a drive-by,' Bakken said.

'To be a successful fugitive you have to cut
 all contacts from your previous life. He had the means and kept a low 
profile.'
