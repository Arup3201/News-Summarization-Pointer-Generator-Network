A graphic photograph of Jodi Arias' ex-boyfriend with his throat slashed open has caused hysterical reactions at her murder trial with one sobbing family member running from the courtroom.

In a dramatic move that led the judge to pause the trial briefly on Wednesday, the prosecution attempted to show jurors a
large photo of Travis Alexander’s head, his throat slit from ear to ear.

Several of Alexander’s family members 
wept and left the Phoenix courtroom while Arias also broke down. The judge later denied a motion for a 
mistrial from defense attorneys.

Overwhelmed: Murder victim Travis Alexander's family and friends sob during the trial this week as graphic photos of his body were shown

The shock tactic by the prosecution came as the defense’ portion of Arias' murder 
trial began this week.

The 32-year-old faces the death penalty if her 
pleas that she stabbed Alexander 27 times and shot him in self-defense 
are not upheld.

Prosecutor Juan Martinez revealed the grisly photo while questioning Lisa Daidone, who dated Alexander in 2007 during his on-off relationship with Arias.

The defense had introduced an angry email that Daidone had sent Alexander when she found out he was sleeping with Arias again.

Showing the photograph, Martinez then asked: 'Do you think that even with everything 
they claimed he put you through, do you think it is appropriate to take a
knife and slash somebody's throat?'

The judge then called for a brief recess before warning those attending the trial to keep their emotions in check.

The prosecution had aggressively grilled Miss Daidone as they attempted to debunk the defense's portrayal of Alexander as a lying cheat who was obsessed with sex.

The ex-girlfriend had told the defense that she broke off her relationship with Alexander because she believed he was cheating on her with Arias.

Miss Daidone testified as Arias defense lawyers began their portion of the trial. The defense claim that Alexander was sexually aggressive and mistreated Arias, who has now admitted to killing him after initially denying it, but said that she did so only in self-defense.

Arias’ ex-boyfriend told the Arizona court on Tuesday that she was sexually aggressive and said she once took a nude picture of him in the shower, just like she reportedly did with Alexander.

Daryl Brewer, Arias’ former live-in boyfriend, also testified that Arias borrowed two gas cans days before she killed Alexander, and that she would not explain why she needed them.

Prosecutors then produced receipts from two gas stations, where it is believed that she filled up the 10-gallon gas containers in quick succession.

The prosecution’s working explanation for those stops is that she filled up the gas tanks so that she would not have to stop for gas on the way to Alexander’s house, potentially showing that she was trying to avoid leaving a trail of her trip to his Mesa, Arizona home.

Mr Brewer was the most detailed witness of the first day of the defense’s case.

He explained that he and Arias dated from 2002 to 2006, and lived together in a house he owned during the second half of that time period.

Towards the end, she met Alexander, converted to Mormonism, and started changing in other ways.

‘She had continued to pay the mortgage, but she was not paying other household bills, she began getting into debt or financial trouble. For me it seemed she was not as rational or logical,’ Mr Brewer told the court on Tuesday.

Mr Brewer, a 52-year-old divorced father of a teenage boy, also said that during the course of their relationship, Arias got breast implants, allegedly to ‘fit in with [his] crowd’.

When asked about their sex life, he said that they had anal sex a number of times, but that she eventually stopped having sexual relations with him towards the end of their relationship, saying that she wanted to save herself for marriage.

On her behalf: Gus Searcy, her former 'mentor' at work, said that she dressed in a feminine way

Another witness called on Tuesday was 
Gus Searcy, who once worked with Arias at a company that designs, 
underwrites and markets legal expense plans.

'She
was always dressed very feminine, but very conservatively,' Searcy 
testified, noting that he never witnessed Arias acting sexually 
inappropriate.

Arias could become the fourth woman on Arizona's death row if she's convicted of killing Alexander.

Authorities allege that Arias shot Alexander in the face, stabbed and slashed him 27 times, slit his throat and left him inside a shower at his suburban Phoenix home after he tried to end their relationship.

Prosecutors argue Arias went to Alexander's home intent on killing him after learning he planned to take a trip to Mexico with another woman.

Arias claimed she ended their relationship, but the two continued a sexual affair.

Police say Arias' bloody palm print and hair were found at the crime scene, and they found sexually explicit, time-stamped photographs in the camera that placed Arias there on the day of the killing.

Arias told police that on the day of the killing, Alexander invited her to his home for sex then became enraged when she dropped his new camera while snapping photos of him. She claims she had to fight for her life.

The photos show Arias nude in Alexander's home and Alexander alive in the shower, then dead in the bathroom.

Defense lawyers have yet to explain why she put the camera in a washing machine.

Authorities say Alexander was shot with a .25-caliber gun, the same caliber weapon her grandparents reported stolen from their California home just days before the killing.

Police have not recovered any of the weapons used in the slaying.
