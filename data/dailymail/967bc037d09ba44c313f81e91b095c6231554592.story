Jonathan Crupi, 30, was taken into custody at 6am at his mother's Brooklyn home where he had been living since the July 5 slaying of his spouse, Simeonette Mapes-Crupi, according to police.

The 29-year-old woman was discovered dead from 15 stab wounds to her back in the couple's condo on Forest Hill Road which appeared as if it was ransacked in the course of a burglary.

However, investigators have always 
believed that the home invasion gone awry was staged because there was 
no evidence to suggest that there was forced entry into the residence, according to the New York Post.

'I had a deep feeling that is was him,
and this is going to prove that it is,' Nick Liverani, the victim's 
uncle, told the Staten Island Advance. 'This was a long time coming.'

Police considered Crupi as an early 
person of interest in the murder, but he was not formally charged with 
any crime at the time.

The 30-year-old remains in custody at the 120th Precinct and is expected to be charged with murder. Investigators have yet to determine the motive behind the brutal slaying.

Mrs Mapes-Crupi was found face-down 
in a pool of blood by the door to their apartment at 1446 Forest Hill 
Road at about 1.50pm on July 5, two days before what would have been her
fifth wedding anniversary. 

The murder occurred in a quiet, tree-lined street in New Springville, across from a golf course where neighbours say crime is scarce.

Police told the Staten Island Advance that there did not appear to be any signs of forced entry at the home, which had been ransacked.

Neighbours reported that they didn’t see or hear anything suspicious until her husband made the horrific discovery.

The couple's dogs were found locked in a room, and neighbors did not 
hear them barking.

One onlooker, who declined to be identified, told the New York Daily News: 'He’s like, "She’s dead! I came home! It was hot! She was dead!

'She’s dead! She’s dead! It was hot! I wasn’t here. I had to work!"' Another witness told the paper that he came out of the home screaming, 'My wife was murdered!'

Another neighbor, Rachel Havia, 43, said the victim had recently celebrated her birthday, adding: 'Her husband brought her flowers and balloons.'

Mrs Mapes-Crupi was a teacher since 2009 at an East New York high school called School for Classics: An Academy of Thinkers, Writers and Performers

It is described as a 'tough' high 
school, where her husband also teaches English. In June, she received
a Master of Science degree in adolescent education from the College of 
Staten Island, according to Advance records.
