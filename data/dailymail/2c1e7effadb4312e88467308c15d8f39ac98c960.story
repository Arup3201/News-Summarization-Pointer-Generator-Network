His comments were so outrageous most of Barack Obama’s opponents were shocked - but he’ll be pleased someone is now standing up for him.

Sarah Palin, 47, has defended country singer Hank Williams Jr, 62, after the storm that erupted after he compared the President to Adolf Hitler.

The former Alaska Governor said the fallout is ‘a very clear illustration of a greater societal problem and that is the hypocrisy on the left’.

She condemned liberals ‘who can throw these stones at a conservative and they knowing that they’re not going to be held accountable’.

Mrs Palin was on Sean Hannity's radio show after Mr Williams’s hugely-controversial comments on Fox News on Monday, reported Politico.

The inflammatory line came when he was asked about Republican House Speaker John Boehner playing golf with President Obama.

Mr Williams said: ‘That would be like Hitler playing golf with (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu. Not hardly. In the shape this country is in?’

ESPN swiftly replaced Mr Williams's song ‘All My Rowdy Friends’ with the national anthem on its Monday Night Football show this week.

It later said the tune, which has been the opening theme song for about 20 years, will no longer used as the curtain opener for the show.

Mrs Palin, a former vice-presidential candidate, confirmed on Wednesday she will not be running for president in 2012.

She told Sean Hannity's show: ‘It’s a one-way street and we’re always walking on eggshells, aren’t we?

‘If I say that is somebody going to misinterpret it or spin it as something that is quote unquote racist or sexist or anything else?’

‘But the other side - they can say whatever they want and nobody calls them out on it. I think it’s pretty disgusting.’

Mr Williams did later acknowledge that his analogy was ‘extreme’ and apologised if he had offended anyone.

But he added that the thought of opposing politicians ‘high-fiving on a golf course while so many families are struggling to get by simply made me boil over and make a dumb statement'.
