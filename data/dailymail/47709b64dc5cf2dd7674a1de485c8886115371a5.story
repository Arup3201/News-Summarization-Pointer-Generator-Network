As a three-star Michelin chef renowned for his whacky concoctions such as snail porridge, he wasn’t the obvious choice to create a picnic fit for the Queen. But that is exactly what Heston Blumenthal did.

The world-renowned British chef conjured up a remarkable five-course menu for 12,000 lucky guests who secured free tickets for today’s Diamond Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace.

The classic hampers featured traditional British dishes such as coronation chicken and Eton mess with a Blumenthal twist – although, unfortunately, there wasn’t a puff of his trademark liquid nitrogen in sight.

Guests began with a chilled country garden soup comprised of baby plum tomatoes and a mint-infused oil, followed by Lapsang Souchong tea-smoked Scottish salmon and Diamond Jubilee chicken.

Heston was keen to include the chicken dish as it was originally devised to celebrate the Queen’s official crowning in 1953 and is, surprisingly, a particular favourite of the chef himself.

Debby Smith, 43, from Manchester, gave a mixed reaction to Blumenthal's Diamond Jubilee chicken, an update of Coronation chicken which was created to mark the Queen's coronation in 1953.

'I tried the little chicken dish and made it into a sandwich. I'm not a lover of Coronation chicken but it's certainly edible.'

‘My family used to go for picnics in
 Windsor Great park and I used to try and wolf it down before everyone 
else. It’s just the ultimate curry,’ he said.

His included a special secret blend of Indian spices with mayonnaise, shredded chicken, coriander and peppery nigella seeds.

It was followed by a Sandringham Strawberry Crumble Crunch with fruit from the Queen’s own estate, meringue, cream and an oat-crumble topping as well as tiny chocolate cakes featuring gold crowns and topped with popping candy, lemon and caraway madeira cake and a cheeseboard.

There was also vegetarian, dairy and gluten free options.

Apparently the Queen tried each and every dish – which took six months to create with the help of royal head chef Mark Flanagan- and gave her seal of approval.

Mr Blumenthal told the Mail: ‘Despite my name I am British through and through and very proud of it. Who would have thought when I was chopping onions a few years ago that I would now be cooking for the Queen.’

The hampers were provided by the Queen’s warrant holder, supermarket Waitrose. Chief executive officer Mark Price said: ‘Her Majesty has personally tasted every dish and has been involved in creating everything that goes into the hamper. Her attention to detail is legendary and we are very proud to be involved in creating them as our Jubilee gift to her.’

Each wicker basket also included a 
voucher for a glass of Moet and Chandon champagne or Cobra beer – ‘very 
civilised’, as one palace aide put it.
Given Sunday’s inclement conditions, it was also prudent of the palace 
to have included a waterproof poncho as well as a patriotic Union Jack –
 although thankfully only a few spots of rain could be felt.

And as the gates opened at 3pm, a 
throng of people –many dressed in patriotic red, white and blue – poured
 through the entrance and into the gardens to devour their treat as a 
steel pan band from St Vincent and St Lucia optimistically played 
‘Feelin’ Hot Hot Hot’.

Among them was Pam Smith, from 
Huddersfield, who was celebrating her 60th birthday. ‘I almost didn’t 
come as I forgot to check my emails which told me I had been successful –
 so what a marvellous present,’ she said.

Diane Dourish, 63, and husband George, 65, from Alnwick, Northumberland 
wore eye-catching Union flag headbands they had been given at a street 
party on Sunday.

Diane said: ‘I had a lump in my throat when I came back here, the palace looks unbelievable, it's such an honour.

‘I entered the ballot because I wanted to see Elton John then I totally 
forgot about it and bought tickets to see him at the Newcastle Arena 
next week for £87.

‘Then I got my tickets, so I'm going to see him next week as well anyway.’

Janyne Littlewood, a 40-year-old primary school teacher from Co Durham, 
was dressed in a Union flag suit she had bought over the internet. ‘It’s
 a once in a lifetime opportunity so you might as well go for it,’ she 
said.

Towards the end of the mini garden party, several members of the royal 
family – the Duke of York and his daughters, Princess Beatrice and 
Princess Eugenie, Princess Anne and the Earl and Countess of Wessex – 
arrived at the palace to meet and greet some of the Queen’s guests.

‘This day just couldn’t get any better,’ said 29-year-old Katie 
Wheatley, from Eastbourne.  And that was before the concert had even 
started.

Of the guests invited, 10,000 were ballot winners and a further 2,000 were from charities associated with the Royal Family.
