The parents of a toddler who was 'sent home to die' have spoken of their outrage after the General Medical Council refused to strike off the doctor who treated him.

The health watchdog was today accused of having 'blood on its hands' after it allowed emergency out-of-hours GP Aboo Thamby to continue working.

Harry Connolly was 19 months old when he died of dehydration and acute kidney failure after suffering inflammation of the colon in May 2011.

Tragic: Harry Connolly died of acute dehydration and kidney failure. His parents say  the last doctor to treat him, out-of-hours GP Aboo Thamby, 'effectively killed' their son

Doctors sent him home three times in three days even though he showed clear signs of dehydration.

The last person to treat Harry was Dr Thamby, who told his parents Lucy, 30, and Ray, 45, their 'lifeless and unresponsive' son had a virus.

He advised them to go home and feed him rice and yogurt. Two days later, Harry died in his sleep.

An inquest last April condemned his treatment and said he died needlessly due to a series of failures and 'catastrophic' errors by medical staff.

And last week, a GMC investigation ruled Dr Thamby's conduct did not meet the standards required of a doctor and risked bringing the profession into disrepute.

It also found that his standard of 
care fell 'below the expected level of a competent GP' and concluded 
there had been 'a significant departure from good medical practice'.

But despite the findings the GMC decided that Dr, Thamby's actions did not fall seriously below the expected levels or care.

They issued him with a formal warning
- but did not suspended his licence or strike him off and allowed him 
to carry on practising as a doctor.

Missed opportunities: Doctors sent Harry home three times in three days - even though he showed clear signs of dehydration

Angry: His parents Raymond and Lucy said the GMC has 'blood on its hands' after allowing Dr Thamby to continue working

Harry's mother branded the decision 'a disgrace' and accused Dr. Thamby of 'effectively killing' her son.

Mrs Connolly, a bank worker, from Delapre, Northamptonshire, said: 'I am beyond furious - the GMC have blood on their hands.

'There were others responsible for Harry's death but effectively he has killed him.

'His actions have lead to his death and the fact he has been allowed to carry on treating patients is disgraceful. 

'Since the day Harry died he has been allowed to continue working as a GP. He has never apologised to us.'

Mrs Connolly, who also has a 
seven-month-old daughter, Edie, said: 'We essentially took him in 
lifeless and unresponsive and the his attitude was to send him home to 
eat some rice and yoghurt. He didn't seem bothered at all - his attitude
stank.

'We have to 
relive this whole nightmare on a daily basis knowing nobody has been 
held accountable. He should have been struck off.

'He's been reported to the GMC before and it's taken for somebody to die before any action is taken.

Dr Thamby advised Mrs Connolly (pictured with daughter Edie) that Harry had a virus, and advised her to feed him rice and water. He died two days later

The toddler had already been admitted to Northampton General Hospital twice in the previous six days, as he was so unwell

'But
despite this and a two year investigation which found he had failed to 
examine Harry properly - this doctor can carry on treating patients. He 
has shown no remorse whatsoever.

'We took this action because we didn't want any other families to go through the heartbreak that we did.

'But now he has been allowed to keep his license - who is to say this couldn't happen again?'

The investigation also found an elderly patient had complained about Dr Thamby 18 months before Harry's death.

Linda Davis, 67, of Cogenhoe, Northants said he misdiagnosed a blood clot on her lung as an ear infection but no action was taken against him by the GMC.

Dr Thamby could not be contacted for comment today.
