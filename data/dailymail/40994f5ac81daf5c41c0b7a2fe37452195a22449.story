FIFA has confirmed the 2022 World Cup final in Qatar will take place on Sunday, December 18.

It comes after a FIFA taskforce recommended last month the tournament should be switched from summer to winter to avoid the searing heat of the Gulf in June and July, where temperatures can exceed 40C.

The decision to hold the first ever winter World Cup was taken more than four years after the most controversial award of a sporting event in history.

Shock: FIFA President Sepp Blatter awarded the 2022 World Cup to Qatar in December 2, 2010

Iron fist: Sepp Blatter, speaking to journalists today, confirmed the final will be on December 18, 2022

Confirming the date for the 2022 World Cup final, Walter De Gregorio, FIFA's director of communications, said: 'This is for us an important step.

'Finally we know the end of the tournament. It's a Sunday and, by the way, it's the national day in Qatar, so it fits perfectly.'

He added: 'You have enough time to do your Christmas shopping.'

FIFA has indicated the 2022 tournament will also be shortened to 28 days, instead of the usual 32. The competition is likely to begin (featuring the hosts' Qatar) on November 21.

The decision means the traditional and popular Boxing Day club matches will take place as usual – which will come as some comfort to the Premier League who have strongly opposed the switch.

UEFA - the body that governs European football - had pushed for the final to be as late as December 23.

The Qatar World Cup has been mired in controversy ever since the shock decision to stage the tournament in the desert kingdom which has no footballing history and a questionable human rights record.

Sepp Blatter, FIFA's long-standing president, even admitted last year that staging the tournament in Qatar was a 'mistake' – justifying it by saying 'but one makes lots of mistakes in life'.

Allegations of widespread corruption and collusion dogged the process from the outset.

The idea of holding the prestigious tournament in winter has also proved controversial.

When the decision to hold the competition in Qatar was first made, Blatter vowed: 'The basic conditions – not just for Qatar but for all the candidates – were the same. It means the FIFA World Cup is played in June and July.'

But following major concerns about the scorching weather in the country, he made a U-turn saying it was 'not responsible' to play in the burning sun.

This enraged the Premier League and other European leagues as it will cause huge upheaval to the football calendar.

After learning of the decision of the FIFA taskforce last month, Premier league chief executive Richard Scudamore said: 'I'm very disappointed, that's the word, on behalf of all the European leagues and particularly the European clubs who provide most of the players for this World Cup'.

Then there has been the worldwide condemnation of the treatment of workers hired to build the infrastructure (the Qatar World Cup is set to cost an estimated £138billion – about 60 times more than the South Africa World Cup in 2010).

Human rights groups have accused Qatar of failing to deal with the abuse of migrants, with almost 200 workers dying in the country and a significant number believed to have sustained injuries due to unsafe working practices.

Campaigners also revealed how workers toiled for long hours for pitiful wages in unsafe and insanitary conditions.
