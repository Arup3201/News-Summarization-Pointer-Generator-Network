President Obama hasn't kept his health-care promises, but at least his Navigators were taught to be more honest -- even if some of them ignored that advice

Two documents released Monday about the Obamacare 'Navigators' couldn't be more different: A congressional report slammed the health insurance helpers for encouraging fraud, while the organization's own training manual encouraged workers to 'be candid, open, and honest' and 'build trust' with Americans seeking health care policies.

The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released its scathing indictment of the Navigator program in conjunction with a Texas field hearing. Investigators found that volunteers tasked with enrolling Obamacare customers were encouraging applicants to lie in order to get government subsidies and favorable premiums.

'Navigators from the Urban League of Dallas were captured on video,' committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa reported, 'encouraging applicants to lie on their health insurance application so the applicants could qualify for tax subsidies.'

'Navigators were also recorded advising an applicant to lie about her smoking habits to obtain a lower monthly premium,' the report added.

In addition to advice reminiscent of Google's 'Don't be evil' rule, the Navigator training manual, provided a stark contrast with the Obama administration's performance since healthcare.gov's Oct. 1 rollout.

'Only offer consumers something that you are sure you can give them,' the manual insists. 'Don’t promise timelines you are not sure you can fulfill. Stick to deadlines ... and never make promises you cannot keep. If situations change, let consumers know as soon as possible.'

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, a hard-charging California Republican, has turned over countless stones in search of new avenues to criticize healthcare.gov and the rest of the Obamacare program

The government prepared a 217-page report to teach Navigators how to do their volunteer jobs, and it took four months to surface publicly

The Obama administration was so keen on keeping the Navigator manual a secret that every page carried a warning designed to discourage would-be leakers

President Barack Obama has been criticized widely for falsely promising that Americans with health insurance policies they liked could keep them under his signature insurance overhaul project.

And the Department of Health and Human Services has missed or postponed more than a dozen deadlines in the Affordable Care Act's implementation.

The training manual was surfaced by the conservative Franklin Center for Government & Public Integrity, and is hosted online by HealthReformGPS, a project of the George Washington University and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

It carries the government's 'Restricted Distribution' classification; each page bears the warning 'INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW.'

The oversight committee's report also blasted local Navigator groups for collecting and mailing paper Obamacare applications – a violation of federal privacy regulations – and for falsely telling consumers that their credit scores could affect their eligibility for new health insurance plans.

Like millions of Americans, Navigator groups were caught off guard when healthcare.gov failed to launch as planned. They lacked a contingency plan for the online flop, congressional investigators found.

'Our system is temporarily down': HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius held a Navigator photo-op in November but no one could reach healthcare.gov

Despite the president's repeated 
urging during the chronically ill website's early weeks that Americans 
could still enroll in Obamacare on paper or via telephone calls, those 
methods also required someone to have access to the website.

House Republicans still have their knives out over Obamacare, this time going after the 'Navigator' volunteers tasked with signing people up

Navigators were in the same boat, it turned out, unable to help people on the phone, or in person either with a laptop or a pen and paper.

'War Room' meeting notes from the healthcare.gov team's first month in action 'show confused HHS officials struggling to advise Navigators about how to respond to the inoperable website,' Issa's committee wrote.

Notes from October 11, 2013 stated that '[t]he paper applications allow people to feel like they are moving forward in the process and provides another option; at the end of the day, we are all stuck in the same queue.'

That dysfunction was on full display Nov. 19 during a Florida visit by HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.

While reporters trailed her during a chat with Obamacare Navigators at a Miami hospital, one noticed that the site was crashing.

'The screen says, "I’m sorry but the system is temporarily down,"' a television reporter told Sebelius, who could only mutter a surprised, 'Uh oh.'
