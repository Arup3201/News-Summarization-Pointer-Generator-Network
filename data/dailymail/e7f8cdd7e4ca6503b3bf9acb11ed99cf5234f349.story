These are the pictures that show the shocking reality of domestic violence in Australia. 

Mother-of-two Sarah Kelly, 34, was brutally bashed by her partner of 11 years in front of her five-year-old son at Hillarys Boat Harbour north of Perth on August 3, 2013.

It was meant to be a sunny family boat trip to Rottnest Island but instead it ended in disaster - with a family destroyed and Ms Kelly hospitalised for ten days.

With a single closed-fist punch following an argument, Ms Kelly's then-partner Alan James Williams, 42, ruptured her right eye, fractured her cheekbone and jaw and broke a bone in her nose.

Mr Williams was last Thursday sentenced to 18 months jail (eligible for parole after nine months) after the District Court of Western Australia convicted him of endangering her life, health and safety.

But a year-and-a-half since the attack, Ms Kelly told Daily Mail Australia she is reminded of the incident whenever she looks in the mirror.

Aftermath: Sarah Kelly's former partner was last week sentenced to an eighteen month sentence with nine months non-parole

The office worker's eye was permanently damaged by the attack - described as 'deformed' in court and 'dead' by doctors. 

She briefly wore a fake acrylic eye over the top of it but does not wear it any more as it is painful. 

Ms Kelly is telling her story because she wants to show the permanent damage that many victims of domestic violence are left with and the need for greater support for victims.  

'When people ask you, "what's wrong with your eye? Have you got an infection?" That painful memory comes back,' she said. 

'I can't turn around and say, "I was in a car accident" - (those victims) don't like how they look, but it's not as bad saying "someone bashed me". 

'I wish it never happened but everyday I have to look at it.'

'I have a lot less confidence now being out in public because I don't want people to stare at my face. 

'For the first year afterwards I didn't even want to leave my house.' 

On top of her permanent injury and the unavoidable reminders, Ms Kelly said the attack resulted in her being subjected to a lengthy court process, extensive hospital time, 'millions of eye appointments', counselling for herself and her son - all while the family moved house. 

'I lived in stress, hell. I was in and out of hospital, and then sitting around waiting for that decision - your life's just hanging (in the balance).'

The attack, which the court heard happened in front of several witnesses, came after what she said was years of 'controlling' behaviour from her partner who she had been planning to leave in the weeks leading up to the assault.  

Her partner checked her internet history and found she had been looking at rental properties, she told Daily Mail Australia.

'I'd gone home and looked at rentals (in July 2013) and he found my internet search history and went off at me.

Before and after: Ms Kelly used to wears her hair over her right eye (pictured right) to prevent people from asking questions about the damage done

'By 2013 I felt really trapped. I just didn't know what to do.'

Ms Kelly used to hide her eye under her hair and sometimes shields it under her sunglasses to prevent questions about it. 

With help, she is beginning to feel better. 'I'm starting to get better. I'm not covering my face. I still don't like making eye contact with people. I feel stronger now.'  

Ms Kelly's 'dead eye' may need to be removed

Ms Kelly is now on the front foot regarding domestic violence, saying its victims are 'left to wear scars'

She said there are charities in the United Kingdom and the United States - such as an American organisation called Face Forward - which help domestic violence victims restore their appearance, but nothing comparable in Australia.

'There's a lot of people with permanent injuries through domestic violence who are left to wear those scars,' Ms Kelly said. 

'It's a reminder of something you don't want to be reminded of'. 

According to the White Ribbon Foundation, one in three Australian women experience physical or sexual violence from someone known to them.  

Instead, the Abbott Government has been criticised for reportedly cutting funds to as many as 50 community services agencies which provide support to victims of domestic and family violence. 

Domestic violence has, however, been placed on the agenda at the Council of Australian Governments (COAG). 

And the issue is gaining a bigger spotlight after family violence survivor Rosie Batty - whose son Luke was murdered by her husband at a cricket ground - was named the Australian of the Year last month.

Ms Kelly, who said she had been frightened of leaving her partner, said: 'If there's not enough help out there, it's less likely a person is going to go to one of those places (a refuge) for help.' 

Ms Kelly said there was a misconception that many victims of domestic violence are from a lower socio-economic background or that substance abuse involved, but neither of that applied to her. 

She said that if someone is aware of domestic violence happening they should report it to the police, just as they would report an attack they witnessed in public. 

'Domestic violence isn't something that just happens to "those people",' Ms Kelly said. 

'It cuts across all races, ethnicities, sexual orientations and socio-economic classes.

'The only good thing I can say out of this now is that I've got my children out of that house.

'They're not going to witness any more of that violence.'

Long way to go: Prime Minister Tony Abbott awards Rosie Batty the title of Australian of the Year
