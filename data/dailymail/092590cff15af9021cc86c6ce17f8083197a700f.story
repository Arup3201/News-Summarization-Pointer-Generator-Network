A man who broke into a house ended up having to be freed by police after he got stuck while climbing through a window.

Daniel Severn, 27, was trying to break into the house of Richard Wilson in Howden, East Yorkshire, by getting in through the bathroom.

But his foot got trapped in the window and he was left hanging upside down for an hour with his head resting on a toilet.

Burglar Daniel Severn, 27, begged his victim to call the police after he got stuck upside down over his toilet

He
tried to contact police with his mobile phone, but dropped it in the 
bath and had to wait until Mr Wilson went into the bathroom at 5.30am.

Mr Wilson described seeing Severn wearing marigold gloves, hanging over the toilet and begging him saying 'please help. Call the police.'

Mr Wilson contacted police who eventually went to his house, but not before Mr Wilson's wife took a photograph of Severn in the window which was left open for the family cat.

While waiting for officers to arrive, Severn told the Wilsons his name and confessed that he was a heroin addict. He was also said to be 'unexpectedly grateful' when police arrived to release him.

Since the incident, Mr Wilson's teenage daughter has been too afraid to live in the house.

Recorder Amanda Ripon said: 'It would be funny if it were not so serious. Make no mistake it was a very serious offence.

‘You
explained to the occupant you were a heroin addict. I doubt that gave 
them much help in distress. You have 80 convictions for 32 court 
appearances. 

The crime took place at Richard Wilson and his family's home in St John's Street, Howden, East Yorkshire

‘The worst part is the teenage daughter who lives at the house now refuses to do so because she fears a repeat of the burglary.’

Crown barrister Mark Kendal said: 'He
said he got his foot stuck climbing in the house. He had a mobile phone
with a torch on it, but it had fallen in the bath. He had two pairs of 
gloves on so as not to leave finger prints and a Stanley knife.’

Mr Kendal said the court heard Severn had 80 previous convictions.

Defending
barrister Richard Sheldon said: ‘While at first glance it would like a 
sophisticated burglary, that really was not the case. The picture shows 
he was dangling by his leg from the window.

‘If
his head had been 1ft to the right his head would have been down the 
toilet. That would have been more appropriate you may think.

‘Although
the family had the horror of finding him, he has expressed genuine 
remorse. He gave them a lot of detail. He told them his name. And that 
he was a heroin addict.’

Severn was jailed for two years and four months.
