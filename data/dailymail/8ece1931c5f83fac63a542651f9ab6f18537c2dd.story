With four bedrooms and grand designs for a playroom, it would seem Euan Blair and his wife Suzanne’s new marital home will have everything they need.

But nothing is ever simple when it comes to the Blair family and their properties.

Because the family have also purchased a one-bedroom mews cottage immediately behind the London house.

Latest acquisition: The £1.2million one-bedroom mews cottage in London bought in Cherie's name in

It expands the Blair property empire, headed by Euan’s parents Tony and Cherie, to ten homes.

The small but stylish cottage cost £1.2million and was bought eight months after the Blairs paid £3.6million for the six-storey Grade-II listed Georgian townhouse.

The two houses are back-to-back and have interlocking floors in a rear extension block which could in theory be knocked through to create a single five-bedroom home.

Next door: The adjoining townhouse worth £3.6million which was purchased eight months ago

Euan, 30, and Suzanne, 26, married last year and have yet to move into their new home while expensive renovations are carried out.

There is no mention of Suzanne’s name on the title deeds of her home. The townhouse was bought jointly by Euan and Cherie, 59, while the mews house is owned solely by Cherie.

Both Euan and his mother are named as directors of a company set up in connection with the mews property.

Former investment banker Euan, said to be eyeing up the safe Labour seat of Bootle, near his mother’s childhood home in Merseyside, has been granted planning permission from Westminster Council for a sumptuous refurbishment of the townhouse.

The Blairs’ architect, Simon Templeton, told the council during the planning process: ‘We are keen to return the property to a beautiful condition, while being mindful of the needs of the young couple that will occupy the property, and provide for the possibility of a future family.’

He outlined plans for a playroom and two ‘family bathrooms’.

A pencil sketch entitled ‘For Euan & Suzanne’ shows proposals for a £100,000 Bulthaup kitchen, as favoured by celebrities such as Robbie Williams and Kim Kardashian.

The two-storey mews property at the back had been on the market for several months before the Blairs snapped it up.

The Blairs would need planning permission if they wanted to knock the two properties together. Or  they could become buy-to-let landlords and rent out the mews home for an estimated £3,000 a month. Together, the two houses cost £4.8million – even more than Tony and Cherie Blair paid for their £3.65million Connaught Square house, dubbed a ‘mini No 10’.

It is perhaps no surprise that they have bought the two latest houses with the help of an ever-growing mortgage from Lloyds Bank.

The millionaire couple have bought homes for their three eldest children, although the ones for Nicky, 28, and Kathryn, 26, cost considerably less at £1.35 million and £975,000 respectively.

Euan married Suzanne last September at South Pavilion, the Blairs’ £9million Grade-I listed mansion in Buckinghamshire.
