An Argentinian airline is receiving praise for its response to a man who complained about the appearance of the airline's flight attendants.

When a Facebook user posted on the Aerolíneas Argentinas Facebook page complaining that the flight attendants were 'short and fat,' the company struck back, politely informing the man that 'prejudice doesn't fly.'

The man, identified on Facebook as Andres Horacio Pignataro, wrote on the page that 'what gets my attention is the low quality of flight attendants that the company has.'

He continued to say that the flight attendants who used to be 'tall, slender, and nice' are now all 'short, fat girls who leave much to be desired' in their appearance.

In response, the company commented on Pignataro's post and wrote: 'Prejudice doesn't fly, we leave it on the ground.'

But that was not all, the company even listed the requirements the company has for flight attendants.

Airline: The exchange has since been posted on Twitter and Facebook as social media users praise the airline for its appropriate response

Flight attendants must be older than 18, the company wrote, they must be citizens of Argentina, they must be high school graduates, they must speak fluent English, they must have a TCP license, and they must know how to swim. 

The company even listed height requirements for the flight attendants with women required to be between 5'4'' and 5'7' and men between 5'7' and 6'1.' 

The exchange has since been deleted from the airline's Facebook page, but not before the airline's comment received more than 500 'Likes.'
