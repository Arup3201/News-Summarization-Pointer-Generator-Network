A teenage girl who died after slipping from a railway station platform has become the latest target of internet trolls.

A Facebook tribute page entitled RIP Georgia Varley was set up in memory of the 16-year-old after she was killed on Saturday night, but hours later offensive messages started appearing.

One Facebook user posted: ‘Blame her heels’, while another posted a picture of 
Thomas the Tank Engine with a message of his innocence.

Another posted a photograph of the deceased Colonel Gaddafi alongside other highly offensive comments.

Georgia Varley, 16, was returning home to Wirral on Saturday night when the tragedy happened. Some 40 to 50 passengers were on the platform at the time of the incident and a number were treated for shock.

Many were posted throughout the night, leading people to believe they were coming from other countries.

Friends of the teenager reported the abuse to a Facebook administrator and they have since been removed.

Georgia had been returning home to 
Wirral on Saturday night when she fell between the platform and one of 
the carriages at Liverpool’s James Street underground station.

Her friends have since set up a new page and taken Facebook advice on how to block the trolls.

One post read: 'Rest In Peace, 
Georgia. Hopefully no "trolls" will find this page, and if they do 
they'll all be blocked immediately.'

A shocked friend of Georgia’s wrote 
on the tribute page after the ordeal: ‘Still can’t get over those people
 commenting on someone innocents memorial page being horrible and 
mocking a young death.'

The user who set up the tribute page 
wrote: ‘Thank you all for being so patient with the removal of the 
horrible comments and thank you all for continuing to post happy 
memories and messages to Georgia and to her friends and family.

RIP Georgia Varley Facebook page: The internet troll's messages were removed

‘I hope no one believes that these 
events have tarnished Georgia’s memory in anyway as we all know she was a
 lovely, happy and smiley young girl who was loved dearly and will 
forever be loved dearly.’

It is thought that Georgia had 
been running along the platform after a Wirral-bound train after a night
 out in Liverpool with friends and family when she fell at around 
11:30pm.

It is believed that some of the party were already on board the train, which had begun to move away from the station.

Up to 50 passengers waiting on the 
platform watched on in horror as the teenager slipped under the wheels 
and was killed instantly. Some have been treated for shock

Her boyfriend, named locally as Pierce, was ‘devastated’ and Georgia’s family are being comforted by friends and relatives.

The incident happened at the underground James Street Station in the centre of the city

Friends have paid tribute to the teenager on a Facebook tribute page, describing her as 'beautiful', 'a princess', and 'a gorgeous girl'

Georgia’s father Paul, of New Brighton, described her daughter as his 'precious angel'.

He said: 'Georgia was just amazing. I have a constant lump in my throat and I don't know how to feel or what to say.

'She was so loved and she never had an upside down smile on. She was such a happy girl.

'I would say to her 'you're always changing between groups of friends' but she made an impression on so many people.'

A spokesman for Facebook said: 'It is
 against Facebook's rules to intimidate or harass others, and we provide
 everyone with the tools to report such content via specific links 
across every page of our site.

One tribute to the teenager said: 'You brought so much joy into all of our lives. There was never a day where you didn't make me laugh. You're my superstar."

'When abuse is reported to us, we react swiftly, and we will disable accounts that are found to be in breach of our terms.

'We strongly encourage people using Facebook to use our tools whenever needed and to report objectionable content so we can investigate reports and take action.'

The spokesman said that 'trolling' was not exclusive to Facebook but that they had set up an 'extensive reporting network' to help combat the problem.

It comes after Sean Duffy was imprisoned for 18 weeks after leaving obscene messages and videos on a condolence page set up by the family of 15-year-old schoolgirl Natasha MacBryde, who committed suicide.

He was also charged over 'offensive images' on a Facebook tribute page set up for Sophie Taylor, who was accidentally shot dead by her boyfriend in April.

It is still unknown exactly what happened on Saturday night when Georgia was tragically killed at James Street station.

One theory is that the teenager may have 
accidentally stepped off the train at the wrong stop and ran to try to 
get back on before losing her step and falling from the platform.

British Transport Police were yesterday continuing with their investigations into the events which led to Georgia's death.

Detective
 Chief Inspector Simon Taylor said: 'We are determined to work out 
exactly what happened to Georgia and I am calling on rail passengers in 
Liverpool to help with this.

'Whatever
 information you have, no matter how insignificant it may seem, it could
 prove valuable in helping us piece together Georgia's final few 
minutes.

'Georgia has left 
behind a distraught family and we want to be able to tell them exactly 
what happened and help them come to terms with the tragedy.'

Most of Georgia's friends were on half term this week and will return to school on Monday.

Staff at Birkenhead Sixth Form College, where Georgia was a student, were planning counselling for friends and those who witnessed her death.

Karen Wiggins, a senior member of staff, said: 'We are all deeply saddened. Georgia joined us in September and had a bright future ahead of her.

'She had a very ready smile and was a beautiful looking girl who was very popular among the students.'
