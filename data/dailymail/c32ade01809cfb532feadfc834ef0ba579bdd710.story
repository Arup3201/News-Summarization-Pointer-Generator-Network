A banker is suing her former sex discrimination lawyer who she says advised her 'to start crying' the next time she had a meeting with her boss.

Hedge fund manager Celia Elizabeth Farnon wants millions in damages from law firm Devonshires because of bad advice she claims was given by her lawyer, Nicola Philp.

Ms Farnon says she approached the law firm after her former employers, investment management company Polar Capital LLP, clipped her yearly bonus by 95 per cent from £800,000 to £36,615.

She claims that, when she complained to her boss in May 2008, she was suspended.

Now she is asking Mr Justice Owen at the High Court in London to award her damages 'in the low millions' against the law firm, claiming they bungled her sex discrimination claim.

Richard Leiper representing Ms Farnon put documents before the judge spelling out her discrimination claim.

He said: 'Ms Farnon felt she had been paid less than men in a comparable position to her own. 

'She also referred to the sex discriminatory environment in which she had been working.'

In the witness box, Ms Farnon told the judge that Ms Philp, a partner in Devonshires, 'told (her) to start crying,' next time she met her boss, when she brought her problems to her.

Ms Farnon's employers allege she committed 'breaches' by colluding with a competitor.

Ms Farnon, who currently lives in Hong Kong, told the judge from the witness box: 'I was told by Miss Philp I was in a very weak position and, as I had a job lined up, there would be no chance of damages for future losses, and that there was basically no room to negotiate. She told me that the claim would be limited to £50,000.

'I trusted her. She had been recommended to me as an expert on sexual discrimination,' she added.

Andrew Short QC, for Devonshires, said that 'everything is in dispute' about Ms Farnon's claim, including what was said between her and the lawyers and what level of bonus she could reasonably have expected.

Cross-examining Ms Farnon, he alleged that it 'hadn't occurred to her' at the time of the meeting with Ms Philp to claim an £800,000 bonus, and that she had sketched out a much more modest £50-70,000 claim.

Mr Short said that Ms Farnon's primary concern when she came to Devonshires had been for them to find her 'leverage' in order to be able to leave her job for another one at short notice, rather than launch a massive sex discrimination claim.

'It only occurred to you after you entered into the compromise agreement with Polar Capital LLP,' he told her.

Mr Short also denied Ms Farnon had been told to start crying in her next meeting with then boss, John Mansell, the Chief Operating Officer of Polar LLP.

'You were not told to start crying at the meeting with Mr Mansell. Miss Philp did not advise you to do that,' he said.

'Miss Philp did,' Ms Farnon replied.

The hearing, set to last for five days, continues.
