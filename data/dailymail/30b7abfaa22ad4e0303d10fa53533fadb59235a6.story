Sergey Kovalev will be left with only a quarter of his purse from his emphatic victory over legend Bernard Hopkins last month.

The Russian unified the WBO, IBF and WBA light-heavyweight titles with a one-sided win over Hopkins in Atlantic City.

But after tax and payments to his trainer and manager, Kovalev will be left with $125,000 of his $500,000 purse.

Hopkins survived a torrid 12th round but lost his IBF and WBA light-heavyweight titles to Kovalev

'Taxes are counted at the end of the year and I have to pay all of them,' he told Russian news agency ITAR-TASS. 'They told me that from my earnings I have to pay 50 per cent taxes, plus deduct payments for my manager and trainer.

'What’s left is about 25 per cent of my purse. There’s not a lot of money to wrestle thinking how to spend it. I have my son, Alexander – all the diapers, clothes – they cost a lot.'

Kovalev's son was born less than three weeks before his fight with Hopkins but he did not see him until after the fight.

The 31-year-old knocked Hopkins down in the first round before dominating until the final bell.

Kovalev will defend his titles against Jean Pascal next March, subject to the Canadian beating Roberto Bolonti on Saturday and IBF approval.

'Sergey has made it very clear since the moment we signed him that he only wants to fight the best fighters,' his promoter Kathy Duva said.

'I promised after his demolition of Bernard Hopkins that the next one would be for the money. I'm thrilled to work with Interbox to bring boxing fans "The Krusher" versus Jean Pascal, which delivers on both fronts.

'The truth is that these fights are easy to make when both fighters want to be in the big fights and the promoters and managers are willing to be reasonable and work together.'
