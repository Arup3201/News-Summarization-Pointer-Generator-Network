David Beckham, but not Ryan Giggs, made it into Roy Keane’s Manchester United XI because he ‘challenged’ Sir Alex Ferguson - and not just as a result of marrying a Spice Girl.

The former England captain had well-known disputes with his manager, notably about the company he was keeping, before moving to Real Madrid in 2003 and makes an all-star cast - almost all of whom had their differences with Ferguson.

Keane, talking in an ITV documentary with Patrick Vieira, had Ruud van Nistelrooy and Eric Cantona leading the line, with no room for Gary Neville - pipped to a right-back slot by Paul Parker. There were also slots for Jaap Stam, Paul Ince and Cristiano Ronaldo.

Hairdryer moment: David Beckham was included as he was the 'better player'

‘You know you don’t win league titles by having choir boys in your dressing room,’ Keane said. ‘These boys did challenge the manager in different ways. Becks challenged the manager, but because you marry a certain woman doesn’t mean you’re challenging the manager. Far from it.

‘I think the manager’s got to understand that we’ve got different personalities in our dressing room but maybe that’s why we are winning trophies.’

Giggs was excluded to make room for Ronaldo, with Keane reasoning: ‘Having a great career doesn’t mean you’re a great player, I think there is a big difference.

‘I’m not saying Giggsy wasn’t... do I leave Ronaldo out? One of the world’s greatest players?  Do I leave Becks out? I just couldn’t feel like I could leave Becks out.’

Vieira was also asked for the best Arsenal XI while he was at the club, which wasn’t quite as controversial.

Thierry Henry and Dannis Bergkamp both made it, unsurprisingly, while wingers Robert Pires and Freddie Ljungberg - so effective during the Invincibles year - got the nod too.

Interestingly, Vieira claims that Ashley Cole was a ready-made Arsenal captain had he not left for Chelsea in 2006.

Talking about when Cole moved to Stamford Bridge, Vieira said: ‘I was quite surprised to be honest. I tried to fight it a little bit because I wanted him to stay.

‘Ashley was supposed to be the next Arsenal captain because he was a player from the youth, grew up to the club and to let him go and see him go was disappointing.’

The pair then had to create a dream team made up of the two squads, with the main bone of contention coming at left-back.

Keane fought hard for Denis Irwin’s inclusion while his rival argued the case of Cole. Amusingly they couldn’t agree.

‘You’d have Denis Irwin in there every day of the week,’ Keane said bullishly.

‘No,’ was the straight reply. ‘Ashley is...’ Vieira started before being cut off.

‘Never heard any off the field stuff (with Irwin),’ smiled Keane. Eventually both players were named.

Beckham was omitted from that side after Vieira insisted on Pires coming in on the right-hand side.

‘Pires over Becks? Jesus, Patrick!’

The two had themselves patrolling the middle of the park.

‘I’ll put myself in there, that’d be good. Ill probably be sent off,’ Keane said.

Vieira: ‘Can you imagine? You would be sent off one week I would be sent off the next.’

These two received 21 career red cards between them.

Best of enemies: Keane and Vieira had a series of bust-ups during their respective careers

Both looked back on now may seem like missed opportunities to play abroad. Vieira was within a whisker of joining Real Madrid while Keane says he had a couple of options.

‘I was really close to leaving to Madrid the year before I left. The deal was done between the two clubs so when it was time for me to leave I changed my mind because I believed that I wanted to stay at Arsenal, I wanted to finish my career at Arsenal.

‘I didn’t see any reason to leave, I don’t know if it was lack of courage to go. If I knew I was leaving the year after  I was going to Madrid.

Keane added: ‘When my contract ran down on a couple of occasions I spoke to a couple of clubs, Bayern Munich, Juventus. I was very tempted I have to say but like yourself there was a bit of fear.

‘Contracts were agreed but I just never felt strong and want to go for it because I was very happy at United.’

Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira were talking in a documentary titled: Keane and Vieira - Best of Enemies, ITV4 10pm Tuesday.
