Twitter and Facebook users who persistently spread racial hatred online should be given 'internet Asbos' under proposals by MPs to tackle rising levels of anti-Semitism.

They called on the Crown Prosecution Service to examine whether prevention orders similar to those which can be used to restrict sex offenders' online access could be applied to hate crimes.

It would mean that 'determined' perpetrators of anti-Semitism online could be blocked from sites such as Facebook and Twitter.

Twitter and Facebook users who spread racial hatred should be given 'Internet Asbos' to combat rising anti-Semitism, say MPs

The report said 'Hitler' and 'Holocaust' were among the top 35 key words used on Twitter last summer

The All Party Parliamentary Inquiry Into anti-Semitism, which was convened following an alarming rise in incidents against Jews during fighting in Gaza and Israel in July and August, said social media platforms have 'increasingly been used for the spread of anti-Semitism'.

The report said 'Hitler' and 'Holocaust' were among the top 35 key words used on Twitter last summer.

Highly abusive posts on the microblogging site were singled out, including the hashtag 'Hitler was right', which was trending in July, as well as the 'presence of Hitlerian themes and imagery on Facebook'.

The MPs' report also called for a government fund to be established to cover the costs of security at synagogues, and for new guidance for teachers on handling the Middle East conflict in the classroom.

David Cameron described the report as 'hugely important', saying: 'Tackling anti-Semitism goes right to the heart of what we stand for as a country.'

'Britain is proud to be a multi-ethnic, multi-faith democracy. It is something we have built over generations and which generations have given their lives to defend. We will not weaken our resolve now but instead redouble our efforts to stand up and defend the values we believe in.

'This report has a vital role to play. There can be no excuses. No disagreements over foreign policy or politics can ever be allowed to justify antisemitism or any other form of racism, prejudice or extremism.

'While I am Prime Minister I promise we will fight antisemitism with everything we have got. Together we will make sure Britain remains a country that Jewish people are proud to call home – today, tomorrow and for every generation to come.'

The warnings about social media sites in the MPs' report comes after Twitter chief executive Dick Costolo admitted they 'suck' at dealing with abuse and so-called trolling, vowing in an internal memo to 'start kicking these people off right and left'.

David Cameron said the report was 'hugely important', adding that Britain must remain 'a country that Jewish people are proud to call home'

The MPs said: 'There is an allowance in the law for banning or blocking individuals from certain aspects of internet communication in relation to sexual offences.

'Informal feedback we have received from policy experts indicates that this is a potential area of exploration for prosecutors in relation to hate crime.

'If it can be proven in a detailed way that someone has made a considered and determined view to exploit various online networks to harm and perpetrate hate crimes against others then the accepted principles, rules and restrictions that are relevant to sex offences must surely apply.'

The report added: 'Given the scale of social media content produced on a daily let alone minute by minute basis, we have some albeit limited sympathy for the companies that are responsible for hosting it.

'Whilst there is rightly an expectation on those companies to act as there is on government, police and prosecuting authorities, so too civil society has a crucial role to play.'

The panel outlined measures to tackle online abuse as it called for 'urgent action' from Government, police, prosecutors and the Jewish community to combat a 'disturbing' rise in antisemitism.

Last week figures released by the Community Security Trust – a charity that monitors anti-Semitism and provides security for the Jewish community in Britain – showed there were a record number of anti-Semitic hate incidents in the UK last year.

Data from the Metropolitan Police supplied to the panel showed that there were 306 anti-Semitic incidents and 236 offences in London between April and November last year. The issue has come under renewed scrutiny following the Paris terror attacks in which a Jewish supermarket was targeted.

Labour MP John Mann, who set up the committee, said: 'This report is a plan of action and a work programme for parliament and government.

'It is the responsibility of parliamentarians to take the leads in this fight. Whoever is in power... can be on notice that we expect it to be the basis of their work programme on tackling antI-Semitism and the new government will be held to account on its delivery.'
