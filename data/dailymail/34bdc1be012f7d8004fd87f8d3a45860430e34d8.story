After indicating to confidantes last week that he'd changed his mind and now want to compete in the 2016 contest for the Oval Office, former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney set to work this week shoring up donations in already-announced GOP candidate Jeb Bush's backyard.

Romney has been reaching out to top Florida fundraisers, theTampa Bay Times reports, trying to woo them away from fellow establishment Republican Bush, the former governor of the Sunshine State. 

He'll also make an appearance at the Republican National Committee's winter meeting in San Diego, California.

Bush is still the only GOP politician to have ceremoniously announced that he is gearing up for a presidential bid.

Rand Paul's hiring on Tuesday of a campaign manager cleared up any remaining doubts that the Kentucky Senator is planning to get in, however, and Chris Christie's reported plans to launch a political action committee suggest that he's building up a campaign infrastructure, as well.

Chris Christie on the floor of the House Chamber at the Statehouse in Boston before inaugural ceremonies for Charlie Baker earlier this month. Romney recently indicated that he may compete in the 2016 contest. Christie will presumably enter the race, as well

OUT: House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan. Ryan, left, the party's last vice presidential nominee, said this week that he will not seek the presidency in 2016 and will work to shape GOP policy as head of the powerful House panel. IN: Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. Paul hired a campaign manager for his not-yet-announced presidential bid on Tuesday, all but confirming that he'll seek the GOP nomination in 2016

These days the list of high-profile Republicans vying for the presidency is longer than the list of those who aren't.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former California Sen. candidate Carly Fiorina, outgoing Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who resigned from Fox News earlier this month, have all indicated interest in participating in the GOP bloodbath next year.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, reelected in November to his second term after overcoming a recall early on in his first, may also make a play for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He has hired at handful of top Republican campaign staffers ahead of a possible bid.

Definitively not running are Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, South Dakota Sen. John Thune and Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan. 

Ryan was floated as a possible 2016 candidate after playing second string to Romney in 2012 as his running mate. 

But once he was officially offered the gavel of the powerful House Ways and Means committee for at least the next two years with an option to stay on as chairman for two more years after that, speculation died down, and on Monday he formally withdrew himself from consideration.

Despite losing the presidency to Barack Obama in the 2012 general election after having failed in 2008 to make it past the GOP primary, Romney remains Republican primary voters' first choice in early states such as Iowa.

A poll conducted by Gravis marketing this month found that 21 percent of registered Iowa Republicans would pick Romney all over again as the GOP nominee if their state's caucus were held now. 

Bush came in second with 14 percent, Walker in third with 10 percent, Huckabee in fourth with nine percent, Rand Paul in fifth with eight percent, and Cruz was close behind with seven percent. 

Christie and Rubio made up the rear with five and four percent, respectively. 

A telling 18 percent said they were still undecided about who they would support a year out from contest. 

Republican Party officials seem less than enthused about a third Romney run than the average voter, however.

'I would be surprised if he gets much traction,' Mark Lundberg, chairman of the Iowa's Sioux County Republican Party, told the New York Times.

Matt Moore, chairman of South Carolina's Republican Party, warned that Romney would have to start from scratch in his state and shouldn't expect a coronation.

'South Carolina Republicans want Governor Romney to make his case compared to our other talented candidates,' Moore said.

'No one is going to hand the nomination to Governor Romney on a silver platter.'

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie gives the annual State of the State address on Tuesday in Trenton, New Jersey. Christie's repeated references to America's place in the world and Washington politicians have politicos believing that Christie has already made up his mind about running for president, too

A presumed candidate, Christie has said he won't make a final decision about a 2016 bid until this spring.

But references to America's place in the world in his State of the State address on Tuesday have politicos believing that Christie has already made up his mind, too.

'America’s leadership in the world is called into question because of a pattern of indecision and inconsistency,' Christie told his constituents. 

'During this time of uncertainty, it seems our leaders in Washington would rather stoke division for their own political gain,' he added, taking a not-so-subtle jab at his potential GOP challengers who hail from the U.S. Senate. 

As head of the Republican Governor's Association Christie was able to mask his national travel as part of his political responsibilities. 

Chairman no more, having handed stepped aside in November to make way for Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, Christie is left with fewer explanations, besides his presidential ambitions, for travel outside his state. 

Today he is in South Carolina - a key presidential primary state - and Friday he will visit Iowa.

Coupled with a New York Times report that that Christie will soon launch a PAC and news that the RNC's fundraising chief is leaving the national party to join Christie's political operation, the New Jersey governor's candidacy is now all but certain.

Paul's recent moves leave little to the imagination about his plans in 2016, as well.

Yesterday the freshman senator hired GOP strategist Chip Englander to oversee his political operation and serve as manager on his forthcoming presidential campaign.

'America has intractable problems and it’s going to take a transformational leader to fix them,' Englander told the Washington Post. 'Senator Paul is going to be the bold, transformational figure in this race.'

Englander most recently served as campaign manager on Bruce Rauner’s successful campaign for Illinois governor.

A half dozen other respected political operatives have also joined the staff of Paul's PAC in the last several months.

FLORIDA FACE-OFF: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has already confirmed that he's gearing up for a presidential bid. That presents a problem for fellow Floridian and Sen. Marco Rubio, who's also interested in running next year

Today Paul is skipping an annual retreat for GOP lawmakers for events in New Hampshire, another significant primary state.

With plans to sit out the confab, Paul amped up his attacks this week on fellow Republicans also eyeing the presidency.

In an interview with Politico Paul said it was 'silly' for Rubio to say he was the 'chief cheerleader of Obama’s foreign policy' because he agreed with the president on the easing of tensions with Cuba.

'We could ask the same [of Rubio,' Paul said. ' "Is he the biggest cheerleader of Obama’s immigration policy?" That’s childish.'

Paul accused Bush and the presidents in his family who came before him, father George H.W. and brother George W., of favoring 'more Washington control.'

'He’s been a proponent of Common Core, a proponent probably of a much bigger government — a Big Government Republican who believes more things should be occurring in Washington rather than decentralization,' Paul said of Jeb. 

Romney, he said, 'wasn’t able to attract a big enough constituency to win, and there was every opportunity to win last time.'

'Time for some fresh blood,' Paul told the Daily Signal.

Speaking to Politico Paul said, 'I think he could have been a good leader of the country. But I think many people are going to say, "He’s had his chance." '

If Paul seeks the presidency it will complicate his reelection to his Senate seat as Kentucky law does not currently allow candidates to appear on the ballot for two separate positions at the same time.

Paul told Politico that the 'most likely option' would be for the state GOP to change its presidential primary to a caucus so that he could compete in both races. 

Should Paul win the GOP nomination for president, he'd have to do additional maneuvering to stay on the ballot as a candidate for the U.S. Senate, as well, in case he loses the general election.

That's a problem his team has another year to solve, though, should it even come to that.
