Service has resumed for many Facebook members after certain parts of the site were down for around four hours this afternoon - with the site blaming the outage on 'network maintenance.'

Facebook prevented people from posting new statuses, writing on walls and making payments.

A spokesman told MailOnline that the four-hour outage was caused by 'network maintenance'.

Facebook users took to other social networks on 21 October 2013 as well to complain that the site wouldn't let them post a new status. Pages and profiles loaded and users could click and view photos, but they were prevented from posting anything new

Users
took to rival Twitter to complain about the social network site's
 technical issues.

Although it appeared to be working as
 normal, with pages and profiles loading without a problem, many members
 reported getting an error message when trying to post anything new to the site.

Data from Compuware’s global web outage monitoring tool confirmed the outage started at around 12.55pm.

According to Compuware's Outage Analyzer, the downtime also had a wider knock-on effect for other websites that have integrated or rely in-part on Facebook’s services to run their own, with over 3,500 other domains affected worldwide.

Twitter user 'SETenorMan' wrote:'The sign of the impending Apocalypse, FACEBOOK IS DOWN!! #EEK! #cantpostpicofmybreakfastsmoothie.

While 's_Colinares07' added: WHY CAN'T WE UPDATE STATUS ON FACEBOOK?! UGHH.'

Whereas other Tweeters seemed happy 
about the news, including MikeBoard1200 who tweeted: '#facebook is down?
 How am I going to see funny eCards and the pictures of babies, posted 
by my high school classmates? #HappyMonday.'

Although it appeared to be working as normal, many members reported getting an error message when trying to post anything new. The official Facebook developers page reported problems with payments, pictured, and this status has not yet been changed

According
 to website Down For Everyone or Just Me.com, Facebook was down and 
experiencing problems, while another site, Is It Down Right Now? claimed
 Facebook was 'up and reachable'.

The official Facebook developers page reported problems with payments too and this status has not changed.

The
 problems could have an adverse affect on the Facebook stock price, 
which closed on Thursday at $52.21 - the highest it has ever been.

Michael Allen, from Compuware, said: 'This outage will have an enormous impact on millions; potentially even billions of people.

'However, it’s not just Facebook and its users who are suffering as a result of these problems - at least 3,587 other domains were impacted; although the actual number is likely to be far greater.

'This is because many other businesses and websites are connected to Facebook through the integration of services from Facebook.'

Although some members are reporting the site has been fixed, website Down For Everyone or Just Me, pictured, is still showing Facebook as down
