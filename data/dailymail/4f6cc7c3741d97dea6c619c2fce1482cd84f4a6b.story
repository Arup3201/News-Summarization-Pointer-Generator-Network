Arrested: Rita Sanders-Campfield, 53, allegedly stabbed Chong Park, 67, because she was practicing witchcraft and needed to be 'perfected', according to her journal

A grandmother allegedly stabbed her roommate to death with a pair of scissors and a butcher knife because she thought she was evil and practiced witchcraft.

Teacher Rita Sanders-Campfield has been charged with murder after Chong Park, 67, was found dead inside the apartment they shared in a quiet condominium in North Bethesda, Maryland.

The 53-year-old Duke graduate was still lying in her bed when a maintenance worker walked into the property to make a routine repair and discovered the victim's body.

Officers reportedly found a pair of scissors covered in blood next to her.  

She was living with Park through the non-profit organisation Housing Unlimited, which accommodates people with low incomes who have had a history of mental illness. 

Investigators revealed that the body had been in the property for several days before it was found and they also discovered a journal kept by the suspect.

According to the Washington Post, one of the early entries suggested Sanders-Campfield believed Park practiced witchcraft and she needed to be 'perfected'.  

In a recent video posted on YouTube, Sanders-Campfield described how she had fallen into a deep depression when her husband suddenly died of pancreatic cancer in 1999.

She said: 'It happened so quickly. I was in a bad place. I didn’t think that I could continue to live in the same home without him. I was fortunate that my mom allowed my son and I to move in with her.'

She spent a year in hospital being treated and when she got out she tried to turn her life around. 

Thanking the organisation that housed her, Sanders-Campfield said that she had the 'perfect' living arrangement.

'It has a party room, a gym, a grocery store across the street, and it’s right near the Metro.' she added.  

Sanders-Campfield appeared in court via a closed-circuit TV link on Wednesday. A social worker said she was in a 'catatonic state' in jail and urged the judge to send her for psychiatric evaluation.

She has been charged with first-degree murder.  

Housing Unlimited's chief executive Abe Schuchman said Park had been living with them since 2006, and that he and his colleagues were deeply saddened by her death, but did not mention Sanders-Campfield in their statement.

They said Park was a 'model tenant' who was 'caring, conscientious, warm, friendly, and well-liked by all.'

The company added that Park's death is the only of 'this nature' during their 20 years of operation.
