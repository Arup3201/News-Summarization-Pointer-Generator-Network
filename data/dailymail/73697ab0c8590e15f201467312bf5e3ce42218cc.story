One of Labour MP Keith Vaz's ancestors, the 'Blessed Joseph Vaz, is set to be made a saint

Labour’s showman backbencher Keith Vaz is not known as a man lacking in self-regard.

As the high profile chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, Mr Vaz has won respect across the House of Commons.

But his colleagues fear he may have his eyes on an even higher prize – after it emerged that one his ancestors is in line to become a saint.

The Blessed Joseph Vaz, a 17th-century missionary known as the Apostle of Ceylon, is likely to be canonised in January, when Pope Francis visits Sri Lanka.

Home Affairs Committee member Paul Flynn said canonisation was a ‘family trait’ which may spur on the Leicester MP to aim for greater things.

He said: ‘This news will bring deep satisfaction to the members of the committee. It has certainly made my day.

‘I know that Keith has a picture of the Pope in his office. What we don’t know if whether the Pope has a picture of Keith on his wall.

‘We can but hope that the announcement today is a harbinger of great things to come for Keith. 

'There’s only a few accolades left for him to win.’

Mr Flynn, a veteran Labour backbench MP, suggested the news may help attract an even greater class of witness to Mr Vaz’s committee.

Celebrities including Russell Brand, Shilpa Shetty and Mitch Winehouse have already been called to give evidence to MPs.

But Mr Flynn said: ‘He already has an impressive list of contacts, but this can only help.’

Pope Francis is likely to canonise 'the Blessed Joseph Vaz', a 17th-century missionary known as the Apostle of Ceylon when he visits Sri Lanka in January

Mr Vaz said he was delighted with the news, but revealed he was unlikely to be allowed to visit Sri Lanka because of his outspoken criticism of the country’s treatment of the Tamil minority.

He said: ‘People are always proud to say they are related to royalty, but few MPs can boast of a saint in the family.’

A senior Labour source said: ‘Is there no end to the Vaz family’s talents?’
