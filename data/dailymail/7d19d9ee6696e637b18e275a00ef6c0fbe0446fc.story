West Brom’s Jeremy Peace has become the first Premier League chairman to call for a system to be introduced to protect the game’s young millionaire players from frittering away their wages.

Football’s ‘too much, too soon’ culture — whereby young stars like Manchester United’s Tyler Blackett can earn £50,000 a week after a handful of games — is causing major concern in football’s higher echelons, because it could demotivate young players, and because they may spend the money unwisely and have nothing left when they need it.

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, under pressure to increase 19-year-old Raheem Sterling’s contract from £40,000 a week, has spoken widely about the issue, stating: ‘Young players get carried away and then wonder why their careers fall away. They buy a new Range Rover Sport before they have a driving licence.’

Former Crewe manager Dario Gradi, who helped develop the career of dozens of players including David Platt and Danny Murphy, has revealed that the subject kept coming up when he was part of Greg Dyke’s FA commission into the game.

Peace is particularly concerned about wages being squandered.

He said: ‘My view on young players is that it would be a good thing to try to protect their money in some way. When you read about Tyler Blackett and other young players getting a big jump in wages, the natural reaction is “Wow”. 

'You just hope, when any young player is being given all this money, that the agents or friends are advising them to put it away somewhere safe, so if it goes wrong or they have an injury, they have something saved to enjoy when they eventually retire.

‘I just think there should be some mechanism in place so all the money they earn is not spent.’

West Brom gave England Under 21 star Saido Berahino the chance to impress at a young age

Peace is at a club that prides itself on developing young players. Albion gave Isaiah Brown a debut at 16 — he has since signed for Chelsea — and currently have England Under 21 striker Saido Berahino on their books. Berahino has already scored six goals this season.

The Albion chairman added: ‘I am sure some agents are already very good at looking after their players long term, but I worry about what happens to others. You hear tales.

‘I remember one player here who came with nothing and went out with nothing. He had earned quite a lot of money in the years he was with us and really had nothing to show for it. 

'A tragedy really, and the figures for Premier League salaries are getting bigger and bigger. For the man in the street, it is a hell of a lot of money.’

Blackett, 20, has been offered a deal by Manchester United that will take his salary from £2,000 to around £50,000 a week, a pay rise of 2,400 per cent. He has played six Premier League matches.

Blackett is currently on £2,000-a-week at Old Trafford but that is about to increase to £50,000 

Although Peace did not go into details about what his ‘mechanism’ should entail, clubs in Holland have experimented with the idea of a trust fund for younger players so they can only access part of their salary when they are older.

Gradi said although the trust fund was not among the recommendations of Dyke’s commission, the issue of growing salaries for young players was one he has heard discussed regularly.

‘It’s a difficult one for me to give an opinion on because we never had that issue at Crewe,’ Gradi said. ‘If we offered a promising young player £500-a-week with a £5,000 signing-on fee, their faces would light up.’

Agent Ian Anderson, who was recently involved in the £13million transfer of Dusan Tadic to Southampton, said: ‘All you can do as a friend is encourage them in general. You might suggest that buying a house rather than renting makes more sense, and things like that.

‘There have undoubtedly been players even at the top level who have earned big money and are now bankrupt or having to scratch around for a living.’
