The battle-scared landscapes of Normandy in northwest France are sharply brought into focus in a series of never-before-published color images taken in the aftermath of the D-Day landings on June 6 1944.

The five images were finally published earlier this month by LIFE.com to mark the 69th anniversary of the landings, a significant moment in World War 2 which resulted in the Allied liberation of Western Europe from Nazi Germany’s control.

The pictures show allied soldiers shifting through the rubble of buildings reduced to dust and entire towns destroyed by intense warfare with the Nazis.

The images were the work of LIFE 
photographer Frank Scherschel (1907-1981), who was an award-winning 
staff photographer for LIFE well into the 1950s.

On June 6, 1944, some 156,000 American, British and Canadian forces, led by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, landed on five beaches along a 50-mile stretch of the heavily fortified coast of France’s Normandy region.

By late August 1944, all of northern 
France had been liberated, and by the following spring the Allies had 
defeated the Germans. The Normandy landings have been called the 
beginning of the end of war in Europe.

'The tide has turned. The free men of
 the world are marching together to victory!' Eisenhower said in an 
historic address after the invasion was launched.

Veterans of the 1944 Normandy 
landings gathered earlier this month on June 6 at the site of history's 
largest amphibious invasion for a day of ceremonies marking D-Day's 69th
 anniversary.

Around two dozen U.S. vets, some in 
their old uniforms pinned with medals, stood and saluted during a 
wreath-laying ceremony at the memorial overlooking Omaha Beach, where a 
U.S. cemetery holds the remains of over 9,000 Americans, including many 
who died during the vicious battle to storm the French shore under 
withering Nazi fire.
