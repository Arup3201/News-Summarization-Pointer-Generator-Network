At first glance, nothing appears to be wrong.

A hotel camera looks out over an empty pavement - with no signs of what is about to come.

In a split second, debris hits the pavement, swiftly followed by the body of a man. After smashing into the concrete pavement at speed from the fifth floor, it looks like he could be in danger of losing his life.

But incredibly, he manages to stand up - with the help of two men -  and walk away without serious injury.
