Surgeons have removed kidneys that each weighed as much as a newborn baby from an Indian man with a genetic disorder.

The giant internal organ reportedly weighed a colossal 6lbs (2.7kg) - and was 20 times bigger thanit should have been.

It was was extracted from a 45-year-old suffering from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).

This condition causes fluid-filled cysts to grow in the kidneys, so they expand in size.

Incredibly, a week after his initial operation at Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, a second kidney weighing 5.5lbs (2.5kg) was removed.

Both kidneys beat the previous record of 4.7lbs (2.1kg), which was removed in Dhule, India, in 2011, according to Guinness World Records.

Normally, healthy kidneys weigh between 125g and 170g in men - less than half a pound.

The patient was diagnosed with ADPKD, which is potentially lethal, last year.

He arrived at the hospital suffering from high fever, blood in his urine and severe abdominal pain before he was admitted.

'I used to remain tired throughout the day due to excessive blood loss,' the patient, whose name has not been released by the hospital, said.

It took a team of surgeons three hours to remove the giant organ, before he was then put on dialysis. He will soon receive a kidney transplant.

Dr Bhargav, one of the surgeons who carried out the procedure, said: 'The kidney was 20 times the normal size and was stuck around the intestines.

Normal healthy kidneys weight between 125g and 170g in men - less than half a pound. One of the kidneys the doctors removed weighed 6lbs (2.7kg) (is is pictured on the scales)

'The patient is recovering and awaiting a kidney transplant.'

ADPKD affects between 1 in 700-1,000 individuals worldwide, with 12.5 million cases globally, and is currently incurable.

It is caused by mutations in one or more genes, causing them to function abnormally.

Cysts develop in the kidneys, and often the livers and the pancreas. Over time, they grow and multiple, replacing normal healthy tissue and causing the kidneys to stop working.

In the early stages, there may be no symptoms and the cysts won't be noticed until adulthood.

They will vary by individual but may include back or abdominal pain, recurrent urinary infections or blood in the urine, kidney stones and kidney failure.

Two thirds of adults with ADPKD will develop high blood pressure, and 1 in 12 will develop small brain aneurysms. 

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an inherited condition that causes small, fluid-filled sacs called cysts to develop in the kidneys.

Although children are born with the condition, ADPKD does not usually cause any noticeable problems until the cysts grow large enough to affect the kidneys' functions.

In most cases, this doesn't occur until 30-60 years of age.

When ADPKD reaches this stage, it can cause a wide range of problems, including abdominal pain, high blood pressure, blood in the urine, urine infections and kidney stones.

Eventually, kidney function gets worse and worse, until so much is lost that kidney failure develops.

ADPKD affects between 1 in 700-1,000 individuals worldwide, with 12.5 million cases globally, and is currently incurable.

It is caused by mutations in one or more genes, causing them to function abnormally.
