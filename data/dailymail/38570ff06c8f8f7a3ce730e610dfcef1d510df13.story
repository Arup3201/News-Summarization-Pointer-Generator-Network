Sue Hemming, head of counter-terrorism at the Crown Prosecution Service, says that Britons who go to fight in Syria will be prosecuted

British citizens who leave the country to join the war in Syria will be prosecuted and could be imprisoned for life, a Crown Prosecution Service chief warned today.

Sue Hemming, head of counter-terrorism at the CPS, said even 'freedom fighters' who wanted to defeat 'loathsome' dictators such as president Bashar Assad would be dealt with 'robustly' when they returned to the UK.

She said that Britons who go abroad to study at terror training camps were breaking the law and would face charges, saying some could be prosecuted even before they'd left Britain if there was evidence that they were planning to fight.

Ms Hemming also warned that further prosecutions would be brought against those yet to depart if police found evidence that they were planning to fight.

Her comments came after a recent spate of arrests by police of young Britons travelling to Britain or planning to go, and a warning from a senior police chief about those who went away to fight.

Last month at least 16 people were arrested on suspicion of terror offences after travelling between Syria and the UK, compared to 24 in the whole of 2013.

Ms Hemming said: 'The message for people who are 
considering going out there and getting involved in terrorist training 
or getting involved in the conflict is that they will be potentially 
breaking the law in this country.'

She added: 'Potentially it’s an offence to go out and get involved in a conflict, however loathsome you think the people on the other side are.

There are currently seven British residents awaiting trial over charges connected to the war in Syria, including two women from London.

Ms Hemming told the London Evening Standard: 'In three of the cases that we are 
prosecuting we allege that they have travelled there, got themselves 
involved in training and come back again.'

She said that three of the cases involved Britons attending training in rebel training camps, and in one of those cases, the CPS will allege that the Briton was going to join al-Nusra, a Syrian rebel group linked to al Qaeda.

Increasing numbers of Britons are choosing to leave their lives in the UK and travel to fight in the Syrian civil war

Ms Hemming said that under Section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006, which bans acts preparatory to terrorism and assisting another person in such activities, the maximum penalty is life.

Sections 6 and 8 of the legislation, which make it illegal to train as a terrorist or to attend a training camp, have a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison.

The prosecutor told the paper that terrorism meant any action driven by political, ideological, religious or racial motives seeking to influence a government or intimidate a section of the public, which meant that even those seeking to oust Assad would be breaking the law.

She said helping in humanitarian relief organisations was not a crime, but said Britons heading out to Syria could meet people from terror organisations while out there and then pose a threat to the security of the UK.

to go to Syria and fight with groups affiliated to al Qaeda.

Akram, 24, who worked for Ludlow Thompson was described by neighbours as 'well-mannered'

London estate agent Akram 
Sebah, 24, was killed alongside his brother, Mohamed, as they waged 
jihad in Syria's civil war, it emerged last month.

The
 brothers, described as 'well-mannered' by neighbours in Holloway, north
 London, had travelled to Syria without telling the rest of their family
 and were thought to have been fighting with al-Nusra.

A year ago, Akram, who has a biomedical sciences degree, was working as an estate agent for firm Ludlow Thompson in London.

His Facebook page contains photographs showing him enjoying himself on nights out with colleagues.

One shows him with his arm around a female colleague as they celebrate their sales team ‘smashing their target again!’.

Last week Akram's distraught father said his sons had told no-one of their plans to go to fight in Syria.

Abdulrahman
 Sebah, 62, of Holloway, north London, said: ‘No father or mother wishes
 their children to go to hell, or to whatever you call Syria.

'If someone
 goes there, absolutely 100 per cent they don’t come back.'

Akram
 studied biomedical sciences at Westminster University from 2008 to 
2011, and worked part time at Marks & Spencer, according to his 
LinkedIn profile.

He joined estate Ludlow Thompson, where 
customers gave him positive reviews, with one writing online: ‘He gives 
estate agents a good name.’

He
 later joined Cherry Pick People, a recruitment firm which headhunts 
estate agents, and whose director Alex Wiffen told the Sunday Times: ‘He
 was a really nice guy.’

Mohamed
 Sebah studied for his A-levels at City and Islington College, and is 
believed to have later taught English in Saudi Arabia.

A
 neighbour of the family, who are of Eritrean descent and live in a 
housing association house in Holloway, said: ‘We found out they had died
 four months ago, but we were told they had died in a car crash in 
America.’
