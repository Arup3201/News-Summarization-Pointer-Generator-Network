Didier Drogba failed to inspire a vapid Chelsea side as they fell to their first defeat of pre-season in his second debut with the club.

The Ivorian forward capped his last Chelsea appearance with the winning penalty in 2012’s Champions League final against Bayern Munich but back in Germany he – and Chelsea’s other forwards - were starved of service in a game they deservedly lost courtesy of Ludovic Obraniak’s header and penalties from Eljero Elia and Felix Kroos.

Brazilian trio Oscar, Willian and Ramires along with World Cup winner Andre Schurrle return for pre-season training on Monday and Jose Mourinho will be glad of a boost to his creative options as Chelsea struggled to break down their German counterparts.

There were some positives though: Thibaut Courtois capped a 45-minute debut with a top save to keep out former Blue Franco Di Santo’s close range header, while Diego Costa again led the line well during his time on the field.

Werder Bremen: Wolf, Fritz, Lukimya, Caldirola, Garcia, Galvez, Bartels, Obraniak, Junuzovic, Di Santo, Elia.

Goals: Elia 17, Obranik 37, Kroos 89.

Chelsea: Courtois
 (Cech 46), Azpilicueta (Boga 70), Zouma (Cahill 46), Terry (Baker 76), Luis (Ivanovic 46), 
Van Ginkel (Mikel 46), Matic, Salah (Hazard 57), Fabregas, Torres (Ake 
57), Costa (Drogba 46).

Subs not used: Chalobah, Christensen, Solanke.

But in truth Mourinho’s Chelsea were disappointing on their fourth outing of this European pre-season tour – and the Blues boss will be glad to regroup at their Cobham base when they return from Germany.

John Terry handled in the area after 18 minutes to give Elia the chance to expertly convert a penalty past Courtois and give Bremen the lead.

And Obraniak doubled the deficit 20 minutes later with a brilliant header that skimmed into the Belgian debutant’s bottom right hand corner.

Chelsea on the other hand were poor – while Diego Costa caused a nuisance up front the best chances of the first half fell to Mo Salah and Fernando Torres who were both wasteful and looked lost on the flanks.

Drogba made his return to the side after the break but frequently found himself second-best to strong Bremen centre back Assani Lukimya.

Cesc Fabregas had Chelsea’s best opening, latching onto Eden Hazard’s ball across the box with 20 minutes left but his chipped effort left a lot to be desired and landed on the roof of Raphael Wolf’s net.

To add insult to injury, substitute Kroos then went on to make it 3-0 minutes before the final whistle after Nathan Ake’s perfectly good last-ditch tackle was deemed to be a penalty by the referee.
