Half of all jobs at the BBC are only open to Corporation insiders, according to newly uncovered official figures.

Thousands of vacancies at the State-funded broadcaster are never advertised publicly, meaning that only people who already work at the BBC are able to apply for them.

Bosses say the policy is necessary to avoid having to make too many staff redundant during a string of re-organisations - but recruitment experts warn that they could be 'restricting the talent base' by failing to hire workers from outside.

Insiders: This website advertises hundreds of jobs at the BBC which are only available to current employees of the Corporation

The BBC has previously faced accusations of cronyism after it emerged that senior executives had been offered jobs paying six-figure salaries which had not been advertised on the open market.

Now figures obtained by MailOnline show that across the Corporation as a whole, half of all job vacancies are advertised only on an internal BBC forum - or not at all.

Between January 2013 and November 2014, there were 6,766 vacancies at the BBC, of which only 3,498 - or 51.7 per cent - were advertised externally.

The remaining 3,268 jobs were only advertised within the BBC, according to the data which were provided by the Corporation following a Freedom of Information request.

The BBC hires outsourcing giant Capita to run its recruitment procedures, with jobs advertised via the publicly accessible BBC Jobs website as well as other media outlets such as local and national newspapers.

However, the site has an additional section which can be accessed only by users with an internal BBC log-in username and password, and contains many more job vacancies than the external sections.

Most jobs are initially advertised only in the internal section of the website, then advertised publicly if there is no suitable internal candidate, according to a BBC spokesman.

The Corporation says it has to prioritise insiders for jobs because of the hundreds of posts which have been eliminated over the past few years as a result of the licence fee being frozen by the Government since 2010.

A spokesman told MailOnline: 'As part of our drive to save £1.5billion the BBC is restructuring and cutting the number of posts we have - so when we do need to recruit priority consideration is given to internal candidates in order to save on redundancy costs.'

A union source suggested that this was nothing more than 'good HR practice' - but an employment lawyer warned that closing off job opportunities could leave the BBC liable to discrimination claims if it cannot prove that it has encouraged applications from all sectors of society.

'The biggest risk by not advertising externally is restricting the talent base,' said Philip Pepper, a partner at Midlands-based law firm Shakespeares. 'You run the risk that you're actually restricting your workforce - so you could risk a claim [for discrimination].

'Public authorities have a greater commitment to equality. They would generally offer the jobs externally as well as internally.'

However, Mr Pepper also said that organisations 'have a duty to avoid redundancy', adding that employers are less likely to face a claim from a laid-off worker if they can show that they have made a reasonable attempt to rehire him or her in a different job.

Official guidelines from the Equality and Human Rights Commission state that employers should consider advertising vacancies publicly in order to attract a diverse range of applicants.

Guidance based on the Equality Act 2010 reads: 'If an employer doesn't advertise at all or advertises in a way that won't reach people with a particular protected characteristic, this might in some situations lead to indirect discrimination, unless the employer can objectively justify their approach.

'This is because not advertising or only advertising in a very limited way may stop people with a particular protected characteristic finding out about a job, which could count as worse treatment.'

In recent months comedian Lenny Henry has led a campaign to increase diversity in the BBC and criticised managers for not giving enough ethnic minority broadcasters a chance to display their talents.

In general, opportunities for private sector workers to move into the public sector are currently extremely rare - separately to the BBC's hiring policy, the Civil Service has imposed a 'freeze on external recruitment' which means that nearly all job vacancies are filled by candidates who are already civil servants.

The BBC came under fire last year over the hiring of senior executives, many of whom apparently landed their high-profile jobs without having to apply for them.

Director general Lord Hall, who was hired in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal, appointed a number of managers, including his former colleague Anne Bulford and ex-Cabinet minister James Purnell, to positions which had not been publicly advertised.

And in November, the BBC revealed to Press Gazette that several senior journalists had been hired to fill jobs which were not even advertised within the Corporation.

The organisation refuses to discuss the hiring of most of its best-known faces - such as economics editor Robert Peston and Newsnight presenter Evan Davis - because they fall under the banner of 'talent' and are therefore exempt from Freedom of Information laws.
