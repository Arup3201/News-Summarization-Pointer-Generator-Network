An Iranian actress - already exiled from the country for exposing her breasts in a 2012 photo shoot - has caused another uproar after posing naked in French magazine, Egoiste.

A stylish black-and-white picture of Golshifteh Farahani taken by world-renowned photographer Paolo Roversi features on the front cover.

It shows the 31-year-old staring sultrily into the camera, body slightly twisted to reveal her completely uncovered form.

Farahani was exiled from Iran in 2012 for revealing her right breast in a promotional video with other actors to promote Cesars - the French equivalent of the Academy Awards.

Exile: Golshifteh Farahani, who has caused an uproar by posing naked in a French magazine, has not been able to return to Iran since 2012 (pictured) when she exposed her right breast in promotional video

Controversy: The 31-year-old actress (pictured at the premier of 'Exodus: Gods and Kings' features completely naked on the front cover of French magazine Egoiste

Authorities phoned her family in Tehran to say she would be 'punished, that her breasts would be cut off and presented [to her father] on a plate', Middle East news site Al-Arabiya reported at the time.

She now lives in Paris with her husband but this latest act of rebellion against her allegedly oppressive home country has raised questions about her safety.

Fox News claims Farahani told the luxury publication: 'France has liberated me. [Paris] is the only place in the world where women do not feel guilty.

'In the East, you are that [guilty] all the time. As soon as you feel your first sexual impulses.'

Farahani is considered Iran's most famous actress after being the first woman from the country to star in a Hollywood blockbuster film.

She recently starred alongside Oscar winner Christian Bale in Ridley Scott's epic 'Exodus: Gods and Kings'. And she appeared in the hit 2008 film 'Body of Lies' with Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio.

In the 2012 road-trip movie 'Just Like a Woman', she played a fugitive accused of her mother-in-law's death alongside Sienna Miller whose character had aspirations of winning a belly dancing competition.

Iran has seen a rise in policies which infringe the 'most basic rights of Iranian women' since the current President took power in 2013, according to the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran.

But some argue that Farahani posing naked is not the best way to support the rights of Iranian women.

Unwelcome: The actress (pictured at the Venice Film Festival) now resides in Paris with her husband and claims that France has 'liberated her'

Kamal Nawash from the Free Muslims Coalition said: 'In addition to degrading and objectifying women, posing naked may actually be counterproductive to supporting women's rights.

'Those opposing equality for women, will just point to the naked women and argue to the parents of the nation that it is their traditional values that prevent their daughters from being degraded and objectified as women.' 

The official Tehran-based news agency has described her as the 'hidden, disgusting face of cinema'.

She was also condemned by Iran's Ministry of Culture for 'not wearing a headscarf' at the New York premiere of 'Body of Lies'. 

Censors banned the last film she made in the country - 'About Elly' - from being shown in the country.

It was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 82nd Academy Awards and eventually won the award for Best Narrative Feature at the Tribeca Film Festival. 

Farahani told the British newspaper The Telegraph that she was also informed by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guide official that the country 'does need any actors or artists' and that she should offer her 'artistic services somewhere else.'

A representative for Farahani did not respond for further comment, and the Iranian government is yet to issue a response to her photo shoot.
