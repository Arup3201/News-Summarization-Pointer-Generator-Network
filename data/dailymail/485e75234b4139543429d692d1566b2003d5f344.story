Kevin Pietersen's advisers can try to conclude negotiations for a new contract at Surrey, as he seeks to reignite hopes of an England recall, after agreeing his Indian Premier League release.

Pietersen was axed by England in February 2014 after their Ashes whitewash defeat in Australia, but is hoping for a still unlikely international return.

He confirmed, on his website kevinpietersen.com, that he has taken another key step to that end by sealing his release from the majority of his IPL contract with the Sunrisers Hyderabad.

Pietersen said: 'My focus is now very much on the upcoming season in England, and I'm absolutely determined to score as many runs as possible.'

Surrey de-registered Pietersen at the end of last season. They have nonetheless long been front-runners to re-sign him, but had no update on Tuesday to the situation as of a week ago when a spokesman said: 'We are still in discussions.'

Pietersen's availability for all formats, as soon as possible, has appeared a starting point for his possible return to The Oval - and his presence at the start of the season, rather than spending six weeks at the IPL, is therefore a key development.

New England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves this month revived the record-breaking 34-year-old batsman's hopes of a return to the fold, contrary to the public remarks by anyone else associated with the governing body.

But a pre-requisite from Graves was that Pietersen must first of all find a way back into county cricket - and then, of course, start scoring runs again.

Pietersen may still be recalled by the Sunrisers for just a one-week period, should they qualify for the IPL knockout stages between May 19 and May 24.

That, however, ought not to be an insurmountable problem for any county interested in securing his services.

He added: 'I've never made any secret of my overwhelming desire to once again represent England, and I'm going to do everything in my power to earn a recall to the international set-up.

'To once again put on that England shirt would be a privilege and an honour, but now I have to focus on performing domestically and give myself the best possible chance of meriting selection.'

A statement on his website spelled out Pietersen's next move - without specifying Surrey as his immediate destination - and that he has his heart set on an England return in time for this summer's Ashes rematch, beginning in July.

It read: 'The four-time Ashes winner, who is also England's highest ever run-scorer in all formats, will... join a domestic county with the aim of earning a place in the England squad for the upcoming Ashes series.'

Pietersen quickly made it clear at the start of this month that he was delighted to take Graves at his word, that the slate will be wiped clean for all under his tenure, and he has since confirmed he has already spoken to the incoming chairman on the telephone.

The controversial South Africa-born batsman has received little encouragement yet in public remarks from other quarters - including ECB managing director Paul Downton and national selector James Whitaker.

Pietersen, however, has said he will 'do anything' to play for England again.
