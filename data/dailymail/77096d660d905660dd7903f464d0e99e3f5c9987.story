A senior Treasury adviser has claimed he was sacked after blowing the whistle when civil service bosses ‘killed off’ a flagship proposal by George Osborne.

David Owen said an employment tribunal had ordered that he should be given his job back but Treasury bosses were refusing to comply.

His case fuelled a row over the power of senior civil servants prompted by a leaked document suggesting they are being encouraged to resist the demands of ministers.

They were accused of undermining democracy as an official document setting out the job description of permanent secretaries was revealed, suggesting civil servants could pick and choose when they backed their political bosses.

Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude criticised the terms used for the recruitment of top Whitehall mandarins, claiming it ‘does not conform with constitutional propriety’.

The document, written in 2009 but in use until last week, states that successful permanent secretaries - the most senior official in each department – must ‘balance’ the immediate needs and priorities of ministers with ‘the long-term aims of their department’.

They act as ‘a “pivot point” in terms of knowing when to “serve” the political agenda and manage ministers’ expectations, versus leading their department with a strong sense of mission’, the document obtained by BBC2’s Newsnight said.

Former Conservative minister Nick Herbert said: ‘I think this is an extraordinary document. This is actually beyond a joke.

‘We can’t have a kind of permanent government of an unelected bureaucracy deciding that it has its own long-term priorities which may be different to those of ministers and elected government.

‘And I think this does go to some of the problems that we’re seeing of a civil service which is sometimes resistant to change.’

Mr Owen claims he was overruled by senior colleagues who amended a key piece of policy advice requested by ministers ahead of the 2011 budget.

He insists he was adhering to the Chancellor’s wishes by including detail of a tax break for small businesses, which he says enjoyed Mr Osborne’s support, in his paperwork.

But his advice was subsequently amended by senior colleagues who allegedly wanted to ‘kill off the policy wholesale’. Managers claimed that David Gauke, a junior Treasury minister, was ‘not keen’ on the proposal and planned to advice the Chancellor against it.

Mr Owen said: ‘I flagged a concern. I was worried that some advice to ministers might not be objective – a breach of the civil service code. My managers suggested a review, but it never happened because, completely to my surprise, I was suddenly criticised on other grounds and sacked.

‘This seemed extraordinary: there was no complaint of incompetence, nor misconduct.

'So I resorted to an employment tribunal.

Former Conservative minister Nick Herbert said the 'extraordinary document' was actually beyond a joke

'It confirmed that I had worked well with past managers, that the reason given for dismissal was not the real one, and that I had been dismissed unfairly. It ordered I should be given my job back.

‘My department has refused. It has not appealed against the decision, but the permanent secretary has decided he disagrees with it. He’d rather the department incur whatever sanctions apply than take me back.

‘This is surely extraordinary. A rogue employer might set aside what the British justice system has ruled to be fair, but ought a government department do so? And have public resources, starting with the six-figure compensation payout, been properly spent?

‘I had an unblemished career in the civil service. I spoke out – politely, through the proper channels – and I’m now deprived of my career even though a judge has ordered I be reinstated.’
