A random attack by a drunk stranger has completely changed the life of 53-year-old Jose Gonzalez, leaving him in constant pain and with little prospect of ever working again. 

The paving worker from Homestead, Florida was napping in his work car nearly two years ago, waiting for two co-workers to finish drinking at a bar in Marathon when a drunk patron came outside and set the propane tanks in the back of the truck on fire.

Surveillance footage shows the moment then 26-year-old Stuart Collins pulled out a Bic lighter and sparked the flame that then engulfed the truck in flames.

Life changed completely: Jose Gonzalez of Homestead, Florida received third-degree burns to 68 per cent of his body in a July 2013 attack by a stranger 

Spark: The 53-year-old was sleeping in his work truck, waiting for two coworkers to finish up drinking at a Marathon, Florida bar when a drunk man came out and set propane tanks in the back of the vehicle on fire 

Engulfed in flames: The married father-of-one woke up to flames eating away at his clothes, and was on fire for an excruciating 11 minutes 

Suspect: Stuart Collins, now 29, was arrested for setting the car on fire. He is being held on $1.05 million bond for charges of attempted second-degree murder, second-degree arson and criminal mischief

Gonzalez says he woke up to his clothes on fire, but was lucky enough to escape the truck by himself before help arrived.

However, the flames had spread too fast and he suffered covered in fire for 11 minutes - leaving him with third-degree burns on 68 per cent of his body. 

Gonzalez spent the following six months after the July 12, 2013 attack in the hospital, going in and out of a coma while he underwent some 15 surgeries. 

'It changed everything. I am a useless man on a bed,' Gonzalez said in Spanish to CBS Miami. 

'Why did he do this? We don't know each other. He did this for no reason,' Gonzalez said of Collins. 'It seems like he just became enraged and lit the truck on fire and unfortunately I was inside sleeping and he set me on fire. It changed my life forever.'

Now he's speaking out as he plans to file a lawsuit against the owners of J.J.'s Doghouse, the bar that continued to serve Collins.

'If there would have been security, this could have been avoided and I wouldn't be burnt,' Gonzalez told Local 10. 

The Gonzalez family's lawyer Jason Brenner cited surveillance footage which shows Collins entering the bar that night, claiming the video proves the young man was clearly intoxicated.

Fault: Gonzalez says if J.J.'s Doghouse had security protocols in place, they might have prevented Collins from causing harm

'This was a very small bar in terms of space, and where this incident took place, it was but three feet from the back door, and this was an area where people always hung out,' Brenner told WSVN. 'When you see in the video, when this man got out of the cab, he was extremely intoxicated and identified by the bartender. He had erratic and aggressive behavior throughout the evening.'

Collins told police he only had two rum and Cokes and three beers in a six-hour span that night. The now 29-year-old was arrested after the incident and is being held on $1.05 million bond at the Monroe County Jail on charges of attempted second-degree murder, second-degree arson and criminal mischief. 

He has plead not guilty to the charges ahead of his trial, which is expected to start in June. 

Painful: Following the attack, Gonzalez spend six months in the hospital and underwent 15 surgeries 

Never the same: His mobility is now limited and it's unlikely that he will ever work again. That causes a serious hardship on his family since his wife also lost her job as a vice principal 

Forever dependent: Gonzalez is now relies on his wife and teenage son to take care of him

Meanwhile, Gonzalez is in his own form of prison due to to the injuries which have left him completely dependent on his wife and teenage son, and will likely never work again. That has put a serious strain on the family, since his wife also lost her job as a vice principal.

'It's gone from me being able to do pretty much whatever I want with my dad to not being able to do very much at all,' his son Jose Gonzalez Jr said. 'In fact, I have to do most things for him along with my mother.'

In addition to the planned lawsuit against J.J.'s Doghouse, the Gonzalez family settled another lawsuit against the property's owner but the terms were kept confidential.
