The number of women being screened for breast cancer has fallen for a third year running, reigniting the long-standing debate over the benefits and risks of mammograms.

By the end of March last year, 4.28 million of the 5.64 million eligible women aged 53 to 70 in England (75.9 per cent) had been screened within the three previous years.

That compares with 76.4 per cent at the same point in 2013, 77 per cent in 2012 and 77.2 per cent in 2011. 

Of those screened, 17,961 aged 45 or older were diagnosed with cancer - a rate of 8.6 cases of the disease per 1,000 women, up a rate of 8.3 cases the previous year.

And 40 per cent (7,175) of women had invasive but small tumours, measuring less than 15mm in diameter, which are often too small to detect by hand. 

The number of women being screened for breast cancer in England in 2014 fell for a third consecutive year, with 4.28 million of the 5.64 million eligible women aged 53 to 70 (75.9 per cent) having a mammogram

While screening has fallen again this year,  the number remains above the NHS Cancer Screening Programme's minimum standard of 70 per cent.

But the figures have, once again, reignited the debate over the benefits versus the risks of women having regular mammograms.

It comes as a new study, published in The Lancet, reveals women who understand the risk of over-diagnosis during mammogram screening are less likely to take part in programmes.

Lead researcher Professor Kirsten McCaffery, from the University of Sydney, said: 'Mammography screening can reduce breast cancer deaths but most women are unaware that inconsequential disease can also be detected by screening, leading to over-diagnosis and over-treatment.'

In recent years, a mounting body of evidence has suggested breast cancer screening does more harm than good.

Scientists have concluded that women risk false positives, where abnormal results turn out to be normal.

And experts fear women are being subjected to over-treatment, which has included needless breast removal and surgery on harmless cancers that would never have caused symptoms or death during a patient's lifespan.

But leading charities today implored women to continue to have regular mammograms, adding they remain the best way of detecting the disease.

Furthermore, the Department of Health's Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer published in 2011, recognised cancer screening as an important way to detect cancer early, adding around a third of breast cancers are diagnosed through mammograms. 

It comes as a new Australian study found women who understand the risk of over-diagnosis during mammogram screening, have lower intentions to take part in screening programmes

In the UK, the NHS invites all women between the ages of 50 and 70 for regular mammograms, every three years.

In the US, the Preventative Services Task Force recommends women aged 50 to 74 are screened every two years.

Today's figures, published by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, show the number of women opting for screening fell across all age groups within the 53 to 70 range.

Of particular note is a fall among the three younger age groups.

Coverage reached the target of 70 per cent in all but one of the nine regions in the UK.

In London, just 68.9 per cent of eligible women had been screened within three years, while in the East Midlands - the region with the highest coverage - 80.3 per cent of women were screened.  

Breast screening is a method of detecting breast cancer at a very early stage. 

The first step involves an X-ray of each breast - a mammogram - which is taken while carefully compressing the breast.

Most women find it a bit uncomfortable and a few find it painful. 

The mammogram can detect small changes in breast tissue which may indicate cancers which are too small to be felt either by the woman herself or by a doctor.

In recent years a mounting body of evidence has suggested breast cancer screening does more harm than good.

Scientists have concluded women risk false positives, where abnormal results turn out to be normal.

And experts fear women are being subjected to over-treatment, which has included needless breast removal and surgery on harmless cancers that would never have caused symptoms or death during a patient's lifespan.

But leading charities today implored women to continue to have regular mammograms, adding they remain the best way of detecting the disease. 

Detection rates were lowest for women aged 45 to 49 and 55 to 59 (6.5 case per 1,000 women screened), while they were highest among women aged over 70 (15.6 cases per 1,000 women screened). 

Dr Emma Pennery, clinical director at the charity Breast Cancer Care, said while at first glance the declining figures may appear 'worrying', it is not that 'straightforward'.

She told MailOnline screening has both 'benefits and limitations'. 

'It's estimated for every life saved, three women will have unnecessary, often difficult treatment,' she said.

'However, screening remains an effective way of detecting breast cancer at an early stage and this can help to increase the likelihood of successful treatment.

'One of the reasons why the number of women going for screening is declining could be on-going confusion around the benefits and risks of screening. 

'Understandably, this can make women reluctant or anxious about attending.

'Breast Cancer Care wants all women to have access to clear information about screening so they can make an informed choice about whether to attend.'

Meanwhile Dr Christopher Runchel, research officer at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, admitted it is 'disappointing' to see a 'slight decline' in the proportion of women screened.

But he added it is 'good news' that the figure is still above the NHS standard of 70 per cent.  

He told MailOnline: 'Early detection offers the best chance of successful treatment which is why Breakthrough Breast Cancer encourages women to attend screening when invited.

'However, there are some risks associated with breast screening and so it's very important that each woman makes an informed choice as to whether they wish to attend.

'Breakthrough has developed an innovative online guide which gives women the full facts about breast screening and will help them make the decision that is right for them.'  

Lester Barr, chairman of the charity Genesis Breast Cancer Prevention, said it is 'disheartening' to see 'sceptical voices about breast screening have led to the year-on-year decrease in the NHS screening programme'.

He told MailOnline: 'The screening process is crucial to identify breast cancer in its earliest stages.

The new figures published by the Health and Social Care Information Centre found of those 4.28 million women screened in 2014, 17,961 aged 45 or older, were diagnosed with breast cancer, pictured under the microscope - a rate of 8.6 cases of the disease per 1,000 women, up a rate of 8.3 cases the previous year

'During the primary onset of the disease, many women are unable to detect changes by self-examination alone.

'The decreased stats prove that more needs to be done to encourage women between the ages of 47 and 74 to attend their regular breast screening appointments.'

He said it is 'imperative' that the issue is addressed and plans are put into action to combat the decrease. 

The new Australian study, published yesterday, is the first research to examine the effect of including information about the possible harm caused by over-diagnosis and over-treatment, in packs given to women before they choose whether to take part in screening programmes. 

The first symptom of breast cancer most women notice is a lump or an area of thickened tissue in their breast.

Most breast lumps (90 per cent) aren't cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked by a doctor.

Breast pain isn't usually a symptom of breast cancer.

Professor McCaffery said the findings 'underlines the ethical imperative for women to have clear decision support materials so that they can make more informed decisions about whether they want to have a breast screening mammogram.'

'A health system centred around the individual should assist decision-making that incorporates a woman's values and preferences, irrespective of whether her eventual choice is to screen or not.

'Therefore, momentum is shifting from uninformative and persuasive approaches to screening communication to clear and balanced information, giving people the opportunity to make informed choices based on their assessment of the trade-offs between potential outcomes.'

The women, taking part, had not had a mammogram in the past two years, and did not have a personal, or strong family history of the disease.

The scientists findings revealed those women who received detailed explanations about the possible harms linked to screening, had 'significantly less favourable attitudes towards breast cancer screening, although attitudes remained positive overall.

And notably, fewer women said they intended to be screened for breast cancer.

The information given to women was in the form of a booklet and showed outcomes of breast screening over 20 years, compared with no screening, including breast cancer mortality reduction, over-detection and false positive diagnoses.

A control group of women received the same information bar the detail relating to over-detection.
