A Florida congressman got off to a poor start with his new position after mistaking members of a U.S. subcommittee with Indian officials.

Republican Curt Clawson thought he was addressing two members of the Indian government, when he gave an impassioned speech calling for cooperation and commitment.

But after finishing his speech, the two officials he had been addressing, revealed they were actually part of the U.S. government.

Awkward: Curt Clawson looks embarrassed after his mistake was pointed out to him on Thursday

Mistaken identity: Nisha Biswal, left, and Arun Kumar, right, gently explain they are part of the U.S. subcommittee after Clawson addressed them as part of the Indian delegation

Clawson appeared to have got in a muddle because of the surnames of Nisha Biswal and Arun Kumar, who were witnesses at the Committee on Foreign Affairs.

During the meeting the former college basketball player said to them: 'I'm familiar with your country. I love your country,' NBC News reported.

He went on to ask the pair for 'cooperation and commitment and priority from your government' in investment rules.

Clawson added: 'I understand the complications of so many languages, and so many cultures, and so many histories all rolled up in one.'

After finishing his speect, Biswal, who is Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, said simply: 'I think your question is to the Indian government.'

She added: 'We certainly share your sentiment, and we certainly will advocate that on behalf of the U.S.'

Clawson looked dumbfounded when he realized his mistake, but his colleagues appeared to have taken the error in the stride, giving him credit for being new to his role.

He replaced Trey Radel during a special election in June, and Thursday was his first day on the Asia and Pacific subcommittee.

After his appointment, the subcommittee's chairman Steve Chabot had praised Clawson's areas of expertise, saying 'Our newest member of this committee, Curt Clawson ... speaks four languages and all kinds of other great stuff,' Foreign Policy reported.

Clawson has apologized for his error, saying: 'I made a mistake in speaking before being fully briefed'.

He added: 'Iâ€™m a quick study, but in this case I shot an air ball.'
