Attention, LeBron James, Kim Kardashian, Michele Obama and Beyonce: You, as well as dozens of other selfie-snapping celebs, have been put on notice by the recently formed SelfiePolice, which is now charging one dollar for each pompous portrait posted on social media websites.

But self-centered celebs aren't the only targets of the Internet's new self-portrait patrol - anyone with a penchant for excessively posting selfies on the web could be hit with a one-dollar 'fine' from the group.

But it gets even better - it's for a good cause.

New Sheriff in Town: You may want to think twice before sharing that selfie on social media - you could be fined

On Notice: The group has targeted some of the most self-obsessed celebs as its 'most wanted' selfie offenders

The organization was formed by a group of students from Brigham Young University, and all of the profits from the 'fines' handed out for posting selfies online are donated to Vittana, a charitable organization that tries to fight world poverty by giving student loans to college-aged kids in third-world countries.

The 'fines,' of course, aren't actual fines - they serve as an innovative way to ask for donations to a good cause by using one of the biggest phenomenons to hit the self-obsessed world of social media: The selfie.

'When we first came up with the idea we were trying to think of how to 
engage our generation in giving,' co-creator Chas Barton tells the website petapixel.com. 'It’s 
tricky because we’re such a selfish generation, so the question we asked
 was not how do we make our generation charitable, but how do we turn 
selfishness into charity. That’s where Selfie Police was born.'

A good cause: The 'fines' the group collects go towards giving college loans to kids in third-world countries

The organization encourages people to 'accuse' their social media friends and family of selfie violations in one of three ways: Funny, snotty or mean.

Anyone who goes the funny route will post 'OMG you are so beautiful! And nice! That’s why I knew you would pay up at selfiepolice.org #selfiepolice' underneath the offender's selfie. Those who choose snotty will post 'Thanks for that selfie I almost forgot what you looked like! Looks like you owe a dollar to the #selfiepolice selfiepolice.org.'

Anyone who wants to get mean with their accusations are asked to post 'Eh, nice selfie. Use a better filter next time so I can’t actually tell what you look like. Pay up at selfiepolice.org #selfiepolice' under the self-centered photo.

The URL address will direct offenders to the SelfiePolice website, where they are greeted with an explanatory message.

Wanted: Kim Kardashian is one of the world's most notorious selfie offenders - and she's got the cash to pay a lot of 'fines'

'On behalf of humanity, you are hereby fined $1 per selfie on charges of self-obsession. All the money goes to fund education for kids who can’t afford college, let alone a $600 self-indulgence device,' the message on the website says. 'Donate and join us. Police your friends. There’s a lot of work to be done. Together we can turn vanity into charity.'

So far, the organization has raised a little more than $1,400. But that number could balloon if word spreads that there's a new sheriff in Twitter-town.
