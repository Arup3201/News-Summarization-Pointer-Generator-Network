Just when you think you have heard it all - a Queensland cafe has added take-home coffee enemas to its menu. And while they're not everyone's cup of tea, staff have already sold 140 of the DIY kits.

Forget milk and sugar, the alternative-healing way to take your coffee is with a tube, bucket and coffee watered-down with purified water.

But New Earth Cafe owner Sarah Parsons, who has sold 140 coffee enema kits in the past five months at her business in Coolum, Queensland, advises everybody to do their homework properly before even considering committing to the procedure.‘We just always recommend that people buy the Gerson book then they have got first-hand information from Charlotte Gerson who has been using coffee for 70 years to heal all different sorts of diseases,’ she said.

A coffee enema kit must contain purified water and certified organic light-roasted drip-grind coffee

She has been using the coffee enemas for four years with her husband, Ben Parsons, since he was diagnosed with a heart condition.‘When Ben uses it, sometimes he is on the floor and I have to look after him for three hours so it’s not just a walk in the park,’ she said. ‘It’s not just a matter of popping it in and getting these amazing healing reactions – it’s something you have got do for a couple of years.’

Sarah Parsons says people must do their homework before even thinking about signing up for a coffee enema

‘The coffee isn't bad- quite good actually but this middle-class hippy fad really has to stop,’ he posted.Although Ms Parsons admits the procedure is not for everybody, she claims to know people who are now in remission from cancer after using the Gerson method.‘Every cancer is different and every person’s vitamin deficiency is different so then the person’s ratio of coffee to water is different – it all changes,’ she said.
