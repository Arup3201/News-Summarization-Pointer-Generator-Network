James Rodriguez (42%)

Stephanie Roche (33%) 

Robin van Persie (11%) 

Stephanie Roche has missed out on becoming the first woman to win the FIFA Puskas Award for goal of the year.

Colombia's James Rodriguez was declared the winner from a three-strong shortlist including Republic of Ireland international Roche and Dutch striker Robin van Persie.

Roche became an internet sensation following her stunning volley for Peamount United against Wexford Youths Women last year.

Ballon d'Or: Cristiano Ronaldo

Women's world player of the year: Nadine Kessler

Puskas award: James Rodriguez

World coach of the year for men's football: Joachim Low

World coach of the year for women's football: Ralf Kellermann

World XI: Neuer; Lahm, Ramos, David Luiz, Thiago Silva; Di Maria, Iniesta, Kroos; Messi, Ronaldo, Robben

FIFA presidential award: Hiroshi Kagawa

FIFA fair play award: FIFA volunteers 

Over six million fans viewed the goal on Youtube and sparked hopes Roche could become the first woman to claim the coveted award at FIFA's Ballon d'Or ceremony.

But despite a concerted campaign Roche was beaten in the public vote by Rodriguez's stunning effort against Uruguay in the 2014 World Cup.

Unlike her two rivals for the award, Roche's goal was watched by just 95 spectators and was filmed on a camcorder by Wexford coach John Flood. 

Roche collected a short cross from the right on her right instep, flicked it over bemused defender Laura Heffernan with her other boot and from 25 yards magicked up a left-footed missile of a volley that found the top-right corner.

Following her nomination, Roche left Ireland to join ASPTT Albi in the south of France - though she is soon to leave the club after struggling with the language barrier.

Van Persie missed the bash as he stay behind in England to have a scan on a damaged ankle sustained in Sunday's 1-0 defeat to Southampton.

STEPHANIE ROCHE 

PEAMOUNT UNITED vs Wexford Youths (Bus Eireann National League) - 20 October 2013

With her back to goal, Steph Roche collects a pass in her stride before unleashing a menacing left-footed volley on the turn. The fact that the ball didn't touch the ground once from the moment Roche touched it makes the strike all the more magnificent.

JAMES RODRIGUEZ 

COLOMBIA vs Uruguay (World Cup) - 28 June 2014

James Rodriguez was this year's World Cup top scorer and this strike illustrates why. Facing their South American rivals in the last 16, the Colombia playmaker collected team-mate Abel Aguilar's looping header on his chest from 25-yards out. One touch later the ball is in the back of the net as the 23-year-old swiveled and hit a venomous, dipping volley which crashed in off the underside of the crossbar.

ROBIN VAN PERSIE

Spain vs HOLLAND (World Cup) - 13 June 2014

One of the iconic moments from this summer's World Cup as Holland thrashed the holders Spain 5-1 in their opening Group B match. Daley Blind hits a raking 40-yard pass intended for Robin van Persie. Running in between two Spain defenders, the Dutch captain meets the flight of the ball with a breathtaking diving header that looped over Iker Casillas in goal.
