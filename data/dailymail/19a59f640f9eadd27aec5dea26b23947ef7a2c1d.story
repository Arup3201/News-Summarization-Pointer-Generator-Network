A DVLA employee has been fired after he was caught using Facebook in the office on his own mobile phone, it was revealed today.

Managers took action after it emerged the worker accessed the social networking site while at work - even though there was no suggestion he had criticised his employers on the site.

The agency has previously laid off three members of staff for making 'inappropriate comments' about the DVLA, a colleague or customers.

It is thought to be the first time the government agency has taken action against an employee who used Facebook when there was no suggestion their behaviour could discredit the agency.

Critics today hit out at the DVLA's 'draconian' approach to social media following the disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.

The latest figures were revealed after it emerged seven office workers at the the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in Swansea were suspended for 'inappropriate' comments or jokes made on Facebook earlier this year.

The DVLA, which holds the records for Britain's 44 million drivers, bans all staff from accessing social networking websites on the computers they use during their shifts.

Steven George-Hilley, director of technology at the think-tank Parliament Street, which obtained the figures, said: 'Sacking staff for using Facebook at work demonstrates a draconian approach to social media.

'Instead, employers should be embracing digital channels and encouraging staff to use social networking sites to deliver faster, more interactive services to customers.'

The employee fired last year was said to have used Facebook on a personal phone in the agency's contact centre.

The DVLA said this formed part of 'a list of conduct issues' and was not the only reason for dismissal.

A second employee was issued with a written warning for making an 'inappropriate' comment referencing the DVLA on Twitter.

A spokesman said: 'DVLA staff cannot access any social networking sites on DVLA computers.

'Although instances of staff using social media inappropriately are extremely rare, any incidents of staff using social media at work on their personal phones are always investigated and could result in disciplinary action.

'All staff are aware of the current guidance in place and are reminded of the rules on a regular basis.'
