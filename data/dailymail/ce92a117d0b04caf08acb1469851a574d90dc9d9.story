Denial: Shrien Dewani will board a plane to South Africa tonight after three and a half years fighting to avoid it

Honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani will board a plane for South Africa tomorrow night after a three-and-a-half year battle – and the world will finally learn whether the mental illness which delayed his extradition is real or faked.

The millionaire care home owner, 33, has denied any involvement in the killing of his Swedish wife Anni, 28, in a crime-ridden suburb of Cape Town in 2011.

Since then his lawyers have fought his extradition to South Africa, where he faces charges of murder and conspiracy.

They have claimed he is ‘too ill to be extradited’ and would be a high suicide risk as he  suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.

But Anni’s father Vinod Hindocha told The Mail on Sunday yesterday: ‘I have always queried in my mind just how mentally ill he was. Just how long can post-traumatic stress last is a question that has been in and out of my mind continually.

‘Shrien was perfectly well during the time he travelled back from Cape Town with Anni’s body and he was arrested soon after.’

While the arguments raged at repeated appeal hearings, Dewani has spent the past 18 months living in a camper van in the grounds of Blaise View mental health hospital near Bristol and has been allowed to visit his family home nearby during the day.

The Mail on Sunday has learned that Dewani is set to enjoy special privileges from the moment he arrives at Valkenberg, a South African psychiatric hospital.

His lawyers have argued that these privileges are necessary to uphold his human rights after the protracted legal battle over his extradition.

A private room has been prepared for him and he will even be allowed to pay for his own chef to bring him meals every day.

Like other patients on the general ward, he will also be able to take part in group therapy, cooking, belly dancing, and sewing classes and will be allowed a free visit to a beauty salon and barber once a week.

But, despite the apparently relaxed conditions, security has been tightened and Dewani’s every move will be watched by investigators determined to prove he is fit enough to stand trial for murder.

The family of Anni Dewani have backed plans to televise the trial of Shrien Dewani in South Africa.

Anni’s father Vinod Hindocha said: ‘She was my daughter, certainly, but since she was shot she has become the daughter of the world.

‘I have been asked if I have any objection and my answer is that I do not. I feel the world wants to know what happened to Anni.

‘Judging by the thousands of letters from across the world we have received from people we have never met, there is a great amount of interest.’

Showing Tuesday’s hearing when Dewani appears to be formally charged – and any resulting hearings – on TV is a decision for the judge. The case could rival the media sensation of the ongoing murder trial of Oscar Pistorius for shooting his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.

Mr Hindocha said he had discussed cameras being in court with South African prosecutors and broadcasters and had given his backing.

Several TV and radio networks have sent applications to the Judge President, arguing there is a valid public interest in live coverage.

The announcement came as Mr Hindocha and his wife called for a change in the extradition process between Britain and South Africa as Dewani’s trial draws near – more than three years after the killing.

‘It has been nothing short of torture for us. An extradition order should not take so long,’ Mr Hindocha told The Mail on Sunday from his home in Sweden.

Dewani’s flight will be met by 
officers from the elite Hawks police unit and he will be escorted to 
Cape Town’s High Court to be formally charged with murder.

From
 there, whether he is granted bail or not, he will go  to Valkenberg, 
which houses some of South Africa’s most notorious killers and rapists.

Hospital insiders say a private room has been refurbished for him in Ward 4 and he will be under 24-hour observation by a team reporting back regularly to the court.

They must decide whether Dewani is capable of going for trial and whether he is aware of the serious nature of the indictment for murder.

A report based on their findings will be submitted to the court within 30 days and his hospitalisation period could be extended or a court date set.

Experts told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Any notion that he has been faking illness for the past few years will be minutely examined.

'Medication will be at a minimum so as not to mask his true condition. Dewani  will be seen regularly by  consultants but it is when he  is back in the ward that he will let his guard down and that is often where we get our most useful insights.

‘His attitude to other patients and the staff, even domestic workers, will be crucial to our observation methods.'

A medical source at the hospital told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Frankly  it is impossible for him  to be genuinely ill for that period, we have never experienced that.’

Dewani denies any involvement in the killing of 28-year-old Swedish national Anni, who was shot as the couple’s taxi was apparently car-jacked in the Gugulethu township in November 2010.

The South African government has made clear it is keen to have Dewani declared fit to stand trial for arranging the killing, after three men already jailed for the murder claimed they were offered £1,400 to carry out the crime.
