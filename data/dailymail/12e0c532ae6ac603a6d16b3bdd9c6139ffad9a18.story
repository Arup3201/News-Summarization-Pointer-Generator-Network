There was a time when women would ban even their husbands from the delivery room.

Lyndsey Thomas, however, decided to invite millions of strangers in – via Twitter.

The 34-year-old caused quite a stir on the social networking site by posting updates at almost every stage of her excruciating day of labour.

Here we go! Lyndsey Thomas, 34, arrives at Whittington Hospital just after 8am on May 16, ten days overdue

She shared pictures of herself posing with doctors, suffering the ‘hell’ of contractions and being injected with an epidural. 

And although she spared her followers the gory details of the final stages, Mrs Thomas was back online just 20 minutes after giving birth as she breastfed daughter Ferne for the first time.

Yesterday, the former marketing executive, who lives with husband Iain and their three-year-old son Teddy, explained why she had shared such intimate moments so publicly.

‘When I got there I thought, “what can I do to pass a few hours before it all kicks off?” she said.

‘I wanted to capture as much as I could, even during my contractions. It was a way of keeping my mind off the pain and telling friends what was happening/

‘It was also a kind of social experiment to see what the reaction would be like. 

‘Everyone was very positive. People were even guessing the weight and the time I would give birth. The staff were all talking about it too.’  

Mrs Thomas was ten days overdue when she was induced on May 16 at Whittington Hospital in North London.

She arrived just after 8am and tweeted the first of nearly 50 updates posted over the course of her labour, writing: ‘Today’s the day! Today we meet our daughter all being well!’. 

She used the hashtag ‘lyndseygivesbirth’ so friends and new followers could easily keep up to date with how she was doing.

By 11.30am she had shared a photo of her bed in the labour ward and got the doctors and midwives to pose for her.

An hour later, she had written of hearing the ‘first screams on the ward’ as another woman gave birth nearby.

Just 
before 1pm, she had updated her followers: ‘Protin gel at 12.50pm. Ouch that
 hurt! Sit and wait time.’

Less than 20 minutes later, she had announced she 
was 2cm dilated and posted pictures of herself posing in bed in a nighty
 and bed socks.

‘Am I having contractions?’ she asked, anxiously. 
‘Timed 2, 15 secs each 13 minutes apart. Will see if another comes along
 before calling midwife.’

At 5pm her contractions had kicked in, prompting her to tweet: ‘It’s true what they say – feels like I have the worst stomach bug in the world. Apparently these are just mild ones #ouch.’

Nine o’clock passed and she had shared the moment she received an epidural as she sucked on a gas pump, writing: ‘I’m high as a kite.’ 

As the birth drew closer, she uploaded a photo of herself holding her bump with her eyes shut in agony, revealing: ‘Was scary for a good half hour.’ 

Then, in the early hours, just a short while after her ordeal, she introduced her daughter to her followers, writing: ‘Ferne Eileen Thomas born at 01.04 weighing in at 7.4.’ 

She then recorded their first breastfeeding session, proudly tweeting: ‘20 minutes old & latched straight on.’ 

Throughout the day, Mrs Thomas had also kept followers up to date with how her husband was coping.

She had posted a picture of him napping on a hospital bed during the early hours of labour, writing: ‘Hard work this supporting the wife whilst she’s in labour lark.’

The Arsenal fan was desperate for his wife to give birth before the FA Cup final on May 17. He went to the game a few hours after the birth of his daughter to watch his team beat Hull City.

Mrs Thomas, who has given up her job in marketing to focus on being a mother, has continued to tweet updates on her daughter’s progress, telling followers about her exhaustion, the perils of breastfeeding and how she is rapidly losing her baby weight.

There have also been a steady stream of pictures of Fearne, who is now three weeks old.

Mrs Thomas added: ‘The staff at the hospital were phenomenal – flawless from beginning to end. Every single person that dealt with me was fantastic.

‘Everything I wanted I was given, so I want to say a huge thanks them.’

A Whittington Hospital spokesman had kept a close eye on the tweets during the day, writing to Mrs Thomas: ‘Wishing you well. We’ll certainly be following you!’
