Members of the public could go on patrol with frontline police officers, a senior Metropolitan Police officer has said.

Assistant Commissioner Helen King said she wanted British police forces to adopt the American 'ride-along' scheme, which sees people join officers on the beat.

Ms King believes confidence in the police could be improved by showing members of the public what officers do and how they make decisions.

Members of the public could go on US-style ride-alongs with frontline police officers, Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Helen King said

According to the London Evening Standard, Ms King said: 'Quite a few forces in the States have a 'ride-along' programme and I have always found that a powerful idea.

'It is quite easy to look at what the police do and pick holes in it but actually once you are alongside them on patrol and realise what they face, how they don't know what's coming next and how quickly they have to make decisions, it helps people understand the pressures they face.'

The scheme was trialled in Lewisham, south-east London, earlier this week in an unmarked car earlier this week with the Metropolitan Police hoping to offer ride-alongs each month to community members interested in policing.

Avon and Somerset and Thames Valley police forces already run similar schemes, but London officers are said to have concerns over the safety of taking members of the public along with them. 

If the scheme is rolled out, people might not be able to go on patrol in their neighbourhood in case officers have to deal with anyone they know. 

There are hopes that the ride-alongs may help increase confidence in policing.

The 'Plebgate' affair, concerns about undercover officers and the inquests into the Hillsborough disaster have all lowered public confidence in the police, with the number of people feeling the Metropolitan Police in particular are doing a good job 'flat-lining' at 68 per cent, Ms King said. 

She added: 'There are individuals in communities who often for legitimate reasons have suspicions about what we do and why we do it. We need to work really hard to break that down and help them understand some of the issues we are dealing with.

'We want many more people knowing and believing that the police are there for them and that they are on their side.'

Last month a report recommended that students, teachers and judges are brought on patrol with inner-city officers.
