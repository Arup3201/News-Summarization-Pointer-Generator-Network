A touching photograph of a sick young girl, being cared for by her family shortly before she died, has won the top portrait prize in Sydney's Head On Photo Festival competition.

Sydney photographer Joe Wigdahl took the image of Kirrilee Edwards, in November 2012, the same month Kirrilee died.

Aged 12, she suffered a seizure which left her with irreversible brain damage and she required 24 hour care by her mother, Jo and father, Troy.

Winning portrait: The heartbreaking photo of a frail Kirrilee Edwards, being touched by her family, won Sydney photographer Joe Wigdahl first prize in the 2014 Head On Portrait competition.

The image, titled Family Loss, won Wigdahl cash and camera equipment for its heartbreaking depiction of a family's love for their daughter, which included six siblings Tarsha, Shavonne, Brooklyn, Mackenzie and twins Connor and Bailey.

The photographer told the MailOnline he was going to donate half his prize winnings to the Edwards family, who forked out a fortune on the care and support for their daughter.

'I wanted to capture this sense of family, this warm, loving, humorous family that connect with one and other through touch,' he told the ABC.

The winning photo was typical of the love Kirrilee received from her parents and six siblings. In 2012, the Daily Telegraph reported on the the Edwards family’s plight.

'They are the human face of a mystery illness that robbed their daughter of a normal life — and changed their own lives forever,' the story said.

The family lived in Springwood in the Blue Mountains.

The Head On Portrait Prize is the major event in Sydney’s annual Head On Photo Festival, run by photographer Moshe Rosenzveig.
