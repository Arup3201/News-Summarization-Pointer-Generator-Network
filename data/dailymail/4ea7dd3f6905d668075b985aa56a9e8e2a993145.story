Cressida Bonas dazzled in white last night at the BAFTA  Tea Party in Los Angeles.

The former girlfriend of Prince Harry headed up a Brit pack including Cara Delevingne, Keira Knightley and the ladies of hit TV show Downton Abbey as they partied in the sunshine town.

And it seems trained dancer Cressida, who is making her acting debut next year, fit right in with the crowd of actors and film producers.

She was spotted chatting  to Downton star Joanne Froggatt at the event which was held ahead of the Golden Globes this weekend.

The party is an annual affair and was held at the beautiful Four Seasons Hotel in Beverley Hills. 

Cressida - who dated Prince Harry on and off for two years - has made no secret of her desire to have her own career and was recently praised by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.

He said: 'Cressida is great in Tulip Fever and people will see what a fantastic actress she is... it will be the first of many roles for her,' said Weinstein.

Cressida - who dated Prince Harry on and off for two years - has made no bones of her desire to have her own career and was recently praised by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. 

Cressida is set to star in Harvey's film Tulip Fever, alongside Cara and Dame Judy Dench and he was full of praise for her acting abilities. 

He said of the 25-year-old socialite: 'Cressida is great in Tulip Fever and people will see what a fantastic actress she is... it will be the first of many roles for her.'

Harvey went on to praise Cressida for not using her relationship with Prince Harry to her advantage, saying: 'She is not taking advantage of any media profile.'

But it's not just her career that seems to be going well. Despite endless speculation that she and Harry may one day give things another go Cressida has reportedly been dating a new man. 

She has apparently been on two dates with Freddie Fox, star of the Riot Club. The pair were first spotted together at a West End screening of Tim Burton’s movie Big Eyes. 

They then enjoyed a second date in LA and were spotted at celebrity hot-spot Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles.

Although she and Harry have remained close friends it is thought that Cressida struggled with dating the Prince. 

It was widely reported that she did not wish to enter into the Royal way of life and be thrust into the spotlight because of her romance.
