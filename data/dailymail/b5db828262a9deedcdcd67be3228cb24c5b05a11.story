Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been elected as head of the conservative party leaving him clear to launch a campaign to return as the country's leader in 2017.

He was under pressure to win the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) leadership by a wide margin and received 64.5 per cent of the vote, well ahead of his nearest rival Bruno le Marie.

This victory advances Mr Sarkozy's hopes of running in the presidential race, and cements his return to the political scene after losing to Francois Hollande more than two years ago.

It comes a decade, almost to the day, after he first became leader of his political party.

The UMP, which has struggled to be effective in opposition to Mr Hollande, will choose its presidential nominee in 2016.

Mr Sarkozy, 59, used the UMP leadership to propel him to victory in 2004 when he won 85 per cent of the vote.

Some analysts have said the recent result was below expectations as he had hoped to receive 70 per cent to keep his re-election hopes alive.

The former French president posted a message on his Facebook page, saying: 'I would like to thank all the UMP members who did me the honour of electing me leader of our political family.

'Their mobilisation, at a level unequalled in the history of our movement, is the best response to two years of internal quarrels and divisions.'

More than 150,000 party members - over 50 per cent - voted in the election, despite the process being slowed down by a cyber attack.

UMP secretary-general Luc Chatel said the party was filing legal action against the unidentified hackers behind the attack, and that police were investigating. 

Mr Le Maire, a former agriculture minister, received less than 29.2 per cent and a third candidate, MP Herve Mariton had just 6.3 per cent.

A spokeswoman for Mr Hollande's Socialist Party said that the UMP's campaign had provided 'nothing new for France'.

'Mr Sarkozy's victory in the campaign for the UMP presidency is not the triumphal return that he was hoping for,' Corinne Narassiguin said. 

Former prime ministers Alain Juppe and Francois Fillon are widely reported to want to be the UMP's candidate for president. 

This victory advances Mr Sarkozy's hopes of running in the 2017 presidential race, and cements his return to the political scene after losing to Socialist Francois Hollande more than two years ago
