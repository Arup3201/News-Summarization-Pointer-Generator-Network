Katherine Jenkins may have been removed from the list of 'approved celebrities' sent dresses from Victoria Beckham's collection, according to reports, but that didn't stop the classical singer wowing in the bright blue number yesterday.

However, at £1,650, the cobalt blue pencil dress for Victoria's Spring/Summer 2012 collection isn't within most fashionistas' budgets.

But FEMAIL have found a near exact match and it will only set you back £79.

Get the look: Katherine Jenkins was spotted in the cobalt blue VB Spring/Summer 2012 dress, and while hers comes with a price tag of £1,650, an online fashion retailer is offering a near match for £79

Prim and proper: The cobalt blue dress features black collars and cuffs and a double zip on the back

The £79 figure hugging dress is available at online fashion retailer McBerry.co.uk and could be mistaken for Victoria's design itself (minus the hefty price tag).

McBerry specialise in celebrity fashion trends and clothes inspired by the season's key looks.

The site describe themselves as a 'destination for fashion-savvy women looking for the latest trends at affordable prices.'

Katherine was pictured wearing the dress as she left London Studios yesterday after filming an interview.

The Welsh singer sported the look to meet Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall during a tour of the new Macmillan Cancer Support unit in the University College Hospital on the same day.

Curvy: The fitted dress certainly flattered Katherine's figure and Victoria has also worn her own design previously but used a belt as an extra accesory

Showcase: Victoria wore the dress at a Hollywood party in February 2012 - the same month as it was worn by a model at New York Fashion Week

Dressed to impress: Katherine wore the dress earlier on Thursday to meet Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall

The fitted dress, which hugged 
Katherine's curves in all the right places, was first worn by Posh, 38, 
at a Vanity Fair party in Hollywood in February 2012.

In an interview with the MailOnline a year ago, Katherine spoke of her love for VB's designs: 'What I love about Victoria Beckham dresses is that they’re simple in the lines and they do everything to emphasise the female form so it pulls you in the right places and it makes you feel very womanly.

'The zips are great. When you buy an expensive dress, so often the zips go on them, but hers have this double zip. She knows what us girls need!'

Katherine
isn't the only famous fan of Victoria's shape enhancing dresses. Elle 
Macpherson, Dannii Minogue and Beyonce are all regularly spotted wearing the former Spice Girl's
designs.
