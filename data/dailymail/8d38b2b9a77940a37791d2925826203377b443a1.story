Festive shoppers at Broad Street Mall in Reading were left aghast when an abseiling Santa was stuck dangling 20 feet above the crowd after catching his beard in the ropes.

Thousands of people have been watching an online video of the moment Santa was trapped in the above the heads of Corrie soap stars Michelle Keegan and Chris Fountain who were preparing to turn on the Christmas lights at the mall.

Following a dramatic entrance by abseiling through the roof to flick the switch with the pair from Coronation Street, his familiar white beard got entangled in the ropes, leaving him stuck halfway down.

Gasps turned to laughter as Father Christmas hung there while his little helpers pushed the plunger to turn on the festive lights in front of a huge crowd of cheering and screaming fans who had packed into the shopping centre for the seasonal celebrations.

Now the online video is set to go viral - it shows Santa, aka 32-year-old Steve Chessell from the 11th Battalion Royal Engineers, based at Arborfield barracks, near Reading, making his dramatic entrance.

A spokeswoman for Broad Street Mall said: 'Santa was left dangling by his beard for about forty minutes before he was eventually rescued by Staff Sergeant Mark Brown and has now returned to the North Pole to prepare for Christmas.'

Eye witness Ryan Gaudreau said: 'Everyone was laughing - he didn't really know what to do.'

Stephanie Maynard, marketing manager at the centre, said Santa was not hurt.

'He could have just taken his beard off and let himself down but he was such a professional and he didn't want to let the children down,' she said.

'He lost his footing as he came through the hole in the ceiling and there was a sudden jolt and he got caught in the clip on the rope.

'Some people were absolutely mortified while others thought it was the funniest thing ever.

'They had to let another rope down and get him down and there was such a roar from the crowd.

'Usually after the lights switch-on the centre empties but there were so many people still there waiting to see if Father Christmas was going to get down.'
