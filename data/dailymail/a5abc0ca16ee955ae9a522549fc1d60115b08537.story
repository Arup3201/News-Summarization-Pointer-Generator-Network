Earls, archbishops and famous composers are among the former residents of historic Johnstone Castle.

But the 16th-century fort is not such a desirable place to live now, with a large housing estate having been built around it since the Second World War.

However, the impressive tower of the castle  has been painstakingly restored to its former glory - and is now on the market for just £450,000.

The home in Renfrewshire, Scotland, boasts four bedrooms, a library, dining room, huge open fireplaces, a great hall and a courtyard.

But despite its grand aspect the building is far from isolated, being within walking distance of a train station - and right in the middle of an estate.

Tower: Johnstone Castle in Renfrewshire boasts four bedrooms, a library, dining room, huge open fireplaces, a great hall and courtyard

Hard work: The owners have spent 14 years renovating it with modern building standards while being sensitive to the original period

Not great for tall people: It features four bedrooms, a library, grand dining room, massive fireplaces, a great hall and a courtyard

And when compared to London prices, the Scottish castle is almost the same as a garage in Kensington and half that of a studio apartment in Mayfair.

Valerie Reilly, of the Johnstone Historical Society, said: ‘It was once owned by the Laird of Johnstone and was one of the grandest houses in the area.

‘What we see today is only a fraction of what the house once was. It was, at one time, a sprawling mansion.

‘But the more modern parts were pulled down and what now remains is the original 16th century tower house.

‘During the war years, it was used as a prisoner of war camp and many Germans were held there.

Light my fire: A spokesman for estate agents Savills said that castle had 'undergone a truly remarkable period-sensitive restoration'

'They would work the land and become well-known to the locals. Frederic Chopin also stayed there before performing a concert in Glasgow.’

Built in 1560, the castle has been owned by the Houston Lairds of Johnstone, the Cochrane Earls of Dundonald and the Archbishop of Glasgow.

Chopin, the composer, was invited to stay by Laird Ludovic while he performed at Glasgow’s Merchant Hall.

But his visit nearly ended in disaster when his horse-drawn carriage smashed into a tree while he was on his way to the concert.

During the Second World War the castle was requisitioned for military purposes. 

Exterior: The castle and its grounds were bought by the local council in 1956 after the building was declared unsafe

Bedtime: The central tower is now all that remains of the castle, and also happens to be the oldest part of the original complex

Step up: The historic 16th century castle has been restored to its former glory and has gone onto the market for just £450,000

It subsequently fell into disuse and in 1956 Johnstone Burgh Council acquired the castle and its grounds.

The land was gradually used to build new homes, and residents of Glasgow and elsewhere moved into the area after losing their homes during the war.

But the 7th Laird of Johnstone stepped in to ensure that the original tower house was preserved.

When the current owner bought the castle from Renfrewshire council in 2004, he became the 8th Laird of Johnstone.

The owners have spent the last 14 years renovating the castle with modern building standards while also being sensitive to the original period.

Historic building: This is how the castle in Renfrewshire looked when it was a mansion, before its demolition upon being bought in 1956

Pricier than the castle: A space in this Kensington garage near the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s home was up for sale for £500,000

Double the price: This £950,000 home in London's Mayfair has a joint living and sleeping area with a small kitchenette and shower room

It features four bedrooms, a library, grand dining room, massive fireplaces, a great hall and a courtyard.

A spokesman for estate agents Savills said: ‘Johnstone Castle has undergone a truly remarkable period-sensitive restoration.’

The central tower is now all that remains of the castle, and also happens to be the oldest part of the original complex.

The castle is a 15-minute walk from Johnstone train station, which has services to Ayr, Glasgow, Largs and Ardrossan Harbour.

It is 15 miles west of Glasgow, and the average house value in the PA5 postcode area is £133,000. The average cost of a Scottish property is £170,000.
