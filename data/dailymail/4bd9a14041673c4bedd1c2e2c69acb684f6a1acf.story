Keen-eyed viewers of the BBC’s flagship First World War TV drama have spotted a nuclear power plant in the background of several scenes filmed on a beach.

The Crimson Field was filmed in the dunes and on the beach at Berrow, Somerset last year.

The beach has featured in several episodes of the drama, which is set in France during the Great War, with one including a football match with several seconds of footage with Hinkley Point nuclear plant - built in 1957 - clearly visible in the background.

Out of time: Hinkley Point power station - built in 1957 - is visible during a scene from First World War drama The Crimson Field, which is set in France in 1915

Authenticity? The scenes were filmed at the beach and dunes of Berrow in Somerset last year

Sedgemoor District Council’s Tim Mander said: 'With all the modern technology available today to edit footage, I was a little surprised to see Hinkley had slipped through.

'I was watching with my wife when I saw the nuclear power station in the background and said "hang on, that looks familiar - that wasn’t there in 1915!"'

BBC spokeswoman Maddy Chambers said the inclusion was an oversight.

She said: 'While we do our utmost to ensure that every shot is period specific, this one must have slipped under the radar.'

The series shows the lives of medics and their patients at a fictional field hospital in France during the First World War

But Mr Mander added: 'Overall, the publicity has been superb and the beach has been featured several times which is great for the area.

'Sedgemoor District Council is delighted to have worked with the BBC during the production of the show at Berrow. The filming took place last autumn.'

He added: 'The BBC was impressed with the help and co-operation given by our Resorts Officer and his team, which ensured the filming went smoothly.

'Sedgemoor is a "film friendly" council and regularly works with Creative England to identify locations required by major film companies within the district.'

The Romans were certainly an advanced civilisation, but as far as we know, they never discovered gas propulsion.

But a scene in the hit film Gladiator suggests otherwise when a chariot strikes a wall and flips over - revealing a gas canister hidden beneath.

This is just one example of hundreds of continuity errors to appear in Hollywood movies but most of them go unnoticed by the audience.

Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, have discovered the brain merges together similar images seen within 15 seconds.

Without this skill, even simple changes in people’s facial expression would be so overwhelming that we’d feel like we were hallucinating.

Other famous gaffes include the incongrous sight of a white van clearly visible in the background of a huge battle scene in Braveheart and a crew member in a straw hat on board a pirate ship piloted by Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.

Perhaps the most famous example is a stormtrooper clearly banging his head on a low hanging sliding door as he runs into a room in George Lucas' Star Wars: A New Hope.
