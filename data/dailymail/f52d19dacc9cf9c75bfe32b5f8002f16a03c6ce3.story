The CDC chief today apologized for suggesting a nurse who contracted Ebola was to blame and admitted that the agency had to 'rethink' how to combat the deadly virus. 

Dr Tom Frieden confirmed on Monday that Texas Health Presbyterian nurse Nina Pham, 26, who treated 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan, was in a 'stable condition' and that everything was being done to give her the best possible care. 

However he added that even one case of the infection being contracted in the U.S. was 'unacceptable'. 

The CDC chief said: 'I feel awful that a hospital worker became infected taking care of an Ebola patient.'

Dr Tom Frieden (pictured today) said the CDC would be 'rethinking' its Ebola strategy after a nurse treating the first Ebola case diagnosed in the U.S. contracted the virus

Nurse Nina Pham, 26, was identified on Monday as the healthcare worker who contracted Ebola while treating 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas 

The CDC was scrambling to interview all staff at Texas Presbyterian who could have been exposed to patient Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian man who became sick after traveling to the U.S. and died at the hospital. Anyone at risk will be monitored, Dr Frieden said.

However he admitted that other healthcare workers who treated Duncan were at risk of Ebola but could not give an exact number as an investigation into the 'breach in protocol' continued. 

Dr Frieden said during the press conference from Atlanta on Monday: 'Stopping Ebola is hard - we're working together to make it easier and better. 

'We have to rethink the way we address Ebola infection control because even a single infection is unacceptable.'

The doctor said that one person who came in contact with Miss Pham, when she may have been contagious, was being monitored closely. 

All 48 people who came in contact with Mr Duncan, who died last Wednesday, were being monitored but none had shown Ebola symptoms, Dr Frieden said.

Health authorities were unclear how the nurse contracted the virus but the CDC was investigating procedures used in caring for an Ebola patient.

Authorities would be paying particular attention to the stage where protective clothing is taken off when the worker has come out of the isolation unit after being in contact with the Ebola sufferer.

The CDC chief suggested that changes may need to be made to protective clothing and said there were plans to bring in a 'buddy system' - where staff could monitor each other as they took off their gear. 

The director urged U.S. hospitals to 'think Ebola' - telling facilities to be on the lookout for patients with fever or symptoms of Ebola who have traveled from the three Ebola-stricken African nations - Liberia, Guinea or Sierra Leone - in the past 21 days. 

Dr Frieden reiterated his belief that travel should not be banned from West Africa to the U.S. So far, JFK airport in New York has introduced screening procedures with four additional airports - Washington-Dulles, Newark, Chicago O'Hare and Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson - to begin on Thursday.

Of the 91 people stopped for additional screening at U.S. airports so far, none had shown Ebola symptoms. 

The CDC's director faced fierce criticism on Sunday when he said a Dallas nurse's 'breach in protocol' caused her to catch Ebola – avoiding responsibility for the first case of the deadly virus transmitted on American soil.

Critics rounded on Dr Thomas Frieden, saying he was 'scapegoating' the nurse - who was wearing a full protective suit as she treated 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan – instead of dealing with his agency's failure to introduce a rigorous set of procedures for hospitals across the country.

Today, Dr Frieden said: 'My intention was not to suggest there was fault with the hospital or the healthcare worker.'

Miss Pham's home was disinfected by a hazmat team on Sunday afternoon, as Texas state officials and the CDC struggled to keep a handle on a growing sense of panic.

Texas State Health Services Commissioner, Dr. David Lakey, said at the press conference on Monday that it was 'very disappointing' to discover one of their own healthcare workers had contracted the Ebola virus. 

Dr Lakey also said that they were trying to find a location to take care of the nurse's beloved King Charles Spaniel and where the pet can be quarantined while he is monitored. The dog is not expected to be destroyed.
