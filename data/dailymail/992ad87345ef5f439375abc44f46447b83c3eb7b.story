A 100 proof vodka-infused turkey is being served at over 100 pubs and taverns across New York City to celebrate this year's Thanksgiving.

The boozy bird, which was unveiled at O'Casey's Restaurant and Irish Pub in Midtown yesterday, is cooked using a whopping five different vodka flavors: cherry, peach, lemon, and apple. 

For big birds like the ones used at O'Casey's the turkey is infused with vodka every six hours over the course of three days.

According to O'Casey's owner Paul Hurley, the amount of alcohol per serving depends almost entirely on how long the turkey is roasted, which is generally up to the chef's discretion.  

O'Casey's turkey is cooked for five hours, after which the chef removes excess sauce and mixes it with more 100 proof vodka to create a gravy that can be served with a straw. According to Mr Hurley, customers have been highly encouraged to use O'Casey's free ride service after indulging in the bird.  

A Gothamist blogger who tried the turkey revealed that it is, 'not as alcoholic as I expected it to be,' adding: 'It tastes more like you ate some turkey after taking a shot of vodka. Though after two bites I think I'm feeling buzzed. I'm not sure if that's a placebo effect.' 

The idea for a vodka-infused turkey first began in Ireland when Mr Hurley's mother asked why the Christmas turkey didn't have any vodka in it. From there, Mr Hurley and his mother developed a recipe with George 100 proof vodka. After careful research and taste-testing, the restaurateur first unveiled the boozy meal at O'Casey's in 2009.

The turkey was a smash hit and quickly sold out. Mr Hurley shared his recipe with other New York City chefs and restaurant owners and it is now available at over 100 restaurants and pubs during the Thanksgiving season including P.D. O'Hurley's, P.D. O'Hurley's West End, Pier 84, and Hudson Beach Cafe. 

The unveiling at O'Casey's Restaurant and Pub was hosted by the United Restaurant and Tavern Owners Association on Tuesday November 25 at lunchtime, just in time for an afternoon pick me up.
