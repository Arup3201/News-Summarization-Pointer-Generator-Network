Incentive: Iain Duncan Smith has said unemployed Britons are starting to take jobs that would normally be filled by immigrant workers thanks to benefits reforms

Unemployed Britons are being made to take jobs currently filled chiefly by immigrant workers thanks to sweeping reforms of the benefits system, Iain Duncan Smith has said.

The Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said pilot schemes of the Government’s new universal credit – which is replacing six different out of work benefits and tax credits – suggested claimants are increasingly moving into seasonal, short-term or part-time work.

Employers have long found people on benefits unwilling to accept such jobs, since they risk losing tax credits, housing benefit or other handouts for positions that may not be secure, and turned to foreign workers.

But Mr Duncan Smith said universal credit, which guarantees that claimants are always better off working, even part-time, was creating a new market in ‘mini-jobs’ for the British unemployed.

‘Under universal credit, there is always an incentive to do more hours,’ the Work and Pensions Secretary said. ‘It makes it more viable to employ a British citizen. They are more flexible than they ever would have been before. Employers don’t need to get somebody from somewhere else.’

Mr Duncan Smith revealed that as universal credit is rolled out across the country, he plans to impose new conditions on those working part-time to push them to do more.

He is planning an extension of sanctions that will affect people currently claiming tax credits and other benefits which see the state top up income. In-work claimants will be challenged to take on more hours or face a sliding scale of cuts to their income.

‘The single most important thing are the in-work allowances in universal credit. At the moment, the adviser stops seeing you the moment you get into work because you just go into the tax credit system,’ Mr Duncan Smith said.

‘Now the adviser will stay with you until you break free of the benefits system altogether. We will be introducing in-work conditionality. There will be a certain point where somebody who has been doing part-time work, we can say “we think in your circumstances you could do at least another five hours a week, let’s find that”.’

Mr Duncan Smith was speaking to the Daily Mail as he prepared to announce the latest phase of universal credit, which is the biggest change to social security since 1945.

Scheme: Mr Duncan Smith said universal credit, which guarantees claimants are better off working, was creating a new market in 'mini-jobs' for the unemployed

The service, which is already available in ten pilot areas across England, Scotland and Wales, is to be rolled out across the first entire region, the North West of England, from Monday. In total 90 jobcentres, or one in eight in Britain, will offer the new benefit.

Mr Duncan Smith has designed the new system chiefly so that claimants will benefit from better work incentives.

People are able to move in and out of work more smoothly, he says, and jobcentres get instant access to HMRC earnings data so they can make sure people are receiving the right amount of support and eliminate fraud.

Claimants have to sign a new commitment which sets out what is expected of them in return for payments, and sanctions – including withdrawal of universal credit – that will be introduced if they fall short.

‘It’s a claimant commitment – a kind of contract. It looks at an individual, requires them to have a CV, be available, attend interviews, take a job if it’s offered, and if you don’t do that this is what will happen,’ Mr Duncan Smith said.

‘For the first time ever, it’s like a contract of work. We are already seeing a significant change of attitude. It focuses the mind, it makes people think about work.

‘By simplifying the mess of benefits and tax credits we inherited, and by improving work incentives, we are ending the something-for-nothing culture.

‘For too long, jobseeker's allowance and tax credits stopped acting as a way of supporting people to get into work and rebuilding their lives in bad times. Instead benefits became a trap.

‘It’s morally right that we break this trap and we take action against a culture of entrenched dependency. We must stop a benefits system that only reinforces hardship.

‘It is absurd that a situation could exist where a lone parent or low paid worker had to think twice about accepting more hours at work because the increase in wages would be minimal. The state was providing a very real disincentive to work.

‘Universal credit is about fundamentally changing the relationship between claimants and the state. We are seeing claimants spending more time looking for jobs and moving smoothly into employment safe in the knowledge that it will always pay more to be in work.’

Mr Duncan Smith dismissed Labour criticism of the scheme, which it supports in principle but has been dogged with IT design faults, leading to successive delays.

‘We’ve changed the way anyone will ever roll out a big IT regime again. Yes, it’s a bit slower, but it’s a damn sight safer,’ Mr Duncan Smith said.
