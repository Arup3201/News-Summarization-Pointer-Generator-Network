Charla Nash, the Connecticut woman disfigured in a 2009 chimpanzee attack, has appealed for permission to pursue a $150million lawsuit against the state.

She appeared before lawmakers on Friday to argue that officials knew the animal was a threat and failed to take action.

In brief remarks to a legislative committee, Nash said the money could help her pay medical bills and give her a chance at a comfortable life.

Slow recovery: Charla Nash, seen on Friday in a Connecticut government building, is hoping to have the right to sue the state because she thinks they should have done more to protect her from being attacked by a chimpanzee

Scars for life: Nash, 60, was blinded, lost both her hands and underwent a face transplant following the attack

Pleading her case: Nash rarely makes public appearances but came to the legislative office building on Friday to appeal to lawmakers to pass a ruling that would allow her to pursue her $150million suit

Nash, 60, was blinded, lost both her hands and underwent a face transplant following the attack.

'The state knew what was happening and failed to protect me,' Nash said.

Last year, State Claims Commissioner J. Paul Vance Jr. refused Nash's request for permission to sue the state, but the General Assembly's Judiciary Committee is considering a bill that would override that decision. The state generally is immune from lawsuits unless allowed by the commissioner.

The 200-pound animal, known as Travis, attacked Nash on February 16, 2009, when she went to the Stamford home of its owner, Sandra Herold, to help her friend and employer to lure the chimpanzee back inside.

The animal went berserk and ripped off Nash's nose, lips, eyelids and hands before being shot to death by a police officer.

Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen told lawmakers the state cannot be held responsible.

'I am not here to diminish Ms. Nash's suffering,' Mr Jepsen said.

Pricey: Nash's nursing care expenses cost approximately $16,000 per month and that does not include the cost of additional medical care

'The law does not support this claim.'

Nash resides at a Massachusetts convalescent center, where she is awaiting a second attempt at a hand transplant. At the same time as her 2011 facial transplant, Nash also had a new pair of hands attached but doctors were forced to remove them because they had poor circulation and she had contracted an infection.

She reached a $4million settlement in 2012 with the estate of Herold, who died in 2010.

Nash's attorneys say that will only cover a small portion of her medical costs.

Her nursing care expenses cost approximately $16,000 per month and that does not include the cost of additional medical care.

Nash's attorneys argue that the state law prohibited ownership of primates weighing more than 50 pounds without a permit, and officials had an obligation to seize the chimp because it was owned illegally by Herold.

Months before the attack, a state biologist warned state officials in a memo that the chimpanzee could seriously hurt someone if it felt threatened.

'They're all negligent because none of them did anything in the face of knowledge that this was an accident waiting to happen,' Mr Willinger said according to The Hartford Courant.

'(The Department of Energy and Environmental Policy) knew you're dealing with an inherently dangerous situationâ€¦they're the ones that knew the foreseeable harm and did nothing. That's negligence.'

The claims commissioner concluded that no law at the time of the attack prevented Herold from owning the chimpanzee.

What remains: Nash is seen holding hands with her daughter on Friday. Nash lost one of her hands entirely and other other hand (pictured) was left with only one finger

He added that if the state had failed to seize the animal, 'The duty owed was to the general public and does not create a statutory obligation to ensure the safety of a private individual'.

On Friday, Jepsen said if Nash is allowed to sue, claiming the state was negligent in not seizing the animal, others will likely pursue lawsuits concerning alleged negligence involving millions of state permit and license-holders.

Jepsen said there are 'cases waiting in the chute' for a decision in the Nash request.

'The risk of floodgates opening up is very significant,' he said.
