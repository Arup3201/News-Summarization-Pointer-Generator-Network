Margaret Leigh-Jones is Britain's oldest DJ as she spins her records twice a week - at the age of 91.

The great-grandmother takes to the airwaves to present her two-hour-long shows on nostalgia station Angel Radio.

She still relies largely on vinyl and cassettes as she blasts out hits by big bands and greying crooners, on Wednesdays and Sundays.

Margaret Leigh-Jones is Britain's oldest DJ as she spins her records twice a week - at the age of 91

All songs on her playlists were released no later than 1959, and include her favourite artists Glenn Miller, Ted Heath, and Duke Ellington.

Retired nurse Margaret, from Havant, Hants, said: 'Not everybody wants to listen to the latest hits, such as One Direction.'

Her predominantly elderly audience phone the station to discuss current affairs, make requests, and even share wartime memories.

A regular feature is "Sing Along at the Kitchen Sink", where listeners are encouraged to join in with an up-tempo song at home.

Margaret, who is married to retired maths teacher Royston, 93, stays 'young' by cycling each day, and has no plans to retire from her new role.

The station - whose slogan is 'snap, crackle, but no pop' - broadcasts on FM, digital DAB, and on the internet.

The perky pensioner claims the bi-weekly DJ slot keeps her feeling young

She said: 'I never had any ambitions to be a DJ when I was younger.

'I was a little nervous getting behind the microphone at first but now I love it, and don't want to give up.'It gives me a real buzz, and helps me stay feeling young.'
