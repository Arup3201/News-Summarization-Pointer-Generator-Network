The devastated family of a man who was snatched by a crocodile in Kakadu National Park during a fishing trip last Saturday has been described as a 'hard working family man' who was 'adored by his grandchildren.'

Contrary to original reports which said Bill Scott, 62, was leaning over his boat to wash a bucket at the Flying Fox waterhole, the statement said he was 'standing at the rear of his moored boat' when he was attacked and dragged into the water by a 4.7 metre long saltwater crocodile in the mid-afternoon.

Bill Scott, 62, has been identified as the man who was snatched from his boat by a crocodile, in a tribute statement released by his family on Friday

'It was fast, over in seconds and suddenly he was gone,' his family wrote.

Mr Scott's remains were found inside one of two crocodiles shot dead by officers in South Alligator River on Sunday in the Arnhem Land region of the Northern Territory.

'He was a good bloke who enjoyed a good story and a laugh over a beer with his mates,' the statement said.

'A "mad-keen" fisherman, Bill loved nothing more than packing up the 4WD, fishing rods and heading bush with his family. He regularly visited remote locations, as well as campsites along South Alligator River for 35 plus years.'

A specialist search and rescue team searched for the 62-year-old man all through Saturday and Sunday at the Kakadu National Park

At the time of the attack, Mr Scott's wife, son and daughter-in-law were forced to drive an hour off-track to seek help at the nearest small town, Cooinda, due to the lack of phone reception in the area.

'The family offers thanks to the kindness of the Northern Territory Police, Kakadu Rangers and Cooinda Lodge staff and many other friends and strangers who have offered assistance within their means through this difficult time,' the statement said.

'Family and friends are advised that a funeral service for Bill will be held at the Thorak Chapel on Wednesday 18th June at 2pm.

'In lieu of flowers, please donate to the Heart Foundation NT.'

It is thought the man, his wife, son and daughter-in-law were in a fishing boat outside of crocodile-management zones patrolled by rangers

Mr Scott was on board a boat outside crocodile-management zones patrolled by rangers when the unusual attack happened, sources say.Â 

Authorities were stunned to hear that he had been grabbed by the crocodile while on board a boat - a situation that is usually considered safe.

However, tourists are warned to beware of crocodiles in any part of Kakadu as an attack is always possible.

Cooinda is a popular tourist area in the heart of the World Heritage-listed Kakadu National Park - where the original Crocodile Dundee movie was shot.

The tiny township is on the banks of the Yellow Water Billabong, described as one of the world's most spectacular wetlands.
