Marseille extended their winning streak to eight games with a 2-0 home win against Toulouse in Ligue 1 on Sunday, but not before manager Marcelo Bielsa sat on a scalding hot cup of coffee.

There were laughs all round when Bielsa, widely regarded as the man who has transformed Marseille into an exciting team, accidentally sat on the coffee perched on an icebox near the touchline.

It had looked like one of the Argentine's coaches had put the cup down on the cooler, and the boss instantly jumped up before angrily turning to his bench and kicking the cup away.

Bielsa's side extended their lead at the top of Ligue 1, with their eighth straight win

That was as scary as it got for Bielsa, whose team comfortably held off a Toulouse side who are 10th on 14 points.

First-half goals by Nicolas Nkoulou and Andre-Pierre Gignac, in front of a club record 61,846 crowd at the Stade Velodrome, wrapped up the win and put Narseukke on 25 points from 10 games.

They lead arch-rivals Paris Saint-Germain by seven points after the champions beat RC Lens 3-1 on Friday.

Bordeaux are third, also on 18 points, after being held to a 1-1 home draw by strugglers Caen on Sunday.

The Argentine soon realised what was on his seat, before he jumped up and turned to his bench

Marseille have conceded only three goals in those eight matches.

'There was a lot of fatigue after the international games but everybody wanted that win,' Gignac, who has scored 10 goals in as many games, told the club website.

Nkoulou shouldered the ball into the net from Dimitri Payet's curled cross after 20 minutes.

Florian Thauvin came close to doubling the tally two minutes later but his low left-foot strike went just wide.

Gignac then beat Zacharie Boucher with a powerful shot from inside the area after Steeve Yago's poor clearance.

Frustrated, Bielsa then kicks the cup away on to the floor and carries on watching the game
