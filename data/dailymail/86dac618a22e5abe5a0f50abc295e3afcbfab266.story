Victim: Michael Saxby, 83, said he was screaming for help as a man and woman trapped him against his car in a supermarket car park and then made away with his life savings

An elderly war veteran today accused shoppers of ignoring his cries for help as he was pinned to his car and robbed in a busy supermarket car park in broad daylight.

Michael Saxby, 83, said he was screaming for assistance as a man and woman trapped him against his car outside his local Tesco and then made away with his modest life savings.

Nobody ran to aid the frail pensioner - who can only walk with crutches - even though the attack happened just 20 yards from the supermarket entrance at 11.30am on a busy Friday morning.

Mr Saxby, of Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, believes the thieves filmed him on a mobile phone as he entered his PIN at the supermarket checkout.

They later mugged him for his wallet and emptied his account of the £700 he relies on to tide him over with his pension payments.

The grandfather, whose legs were injured in the 1950s by a landmine in the Malayan Emergency conflict while he served as an RAF medical orderly, today said he is devastated by those who failed to assist him.

He said: 'I went to my car about six spaces from the main entrance when this man took my wallet out of my pocket and then pinned me to my car.

'He kneed me in the chest and when I fought back, the woman grabbed my wrist and snatched my wallet and took my bank cards.

'What made me really angry and upset was I was screaming for help at the top of my voice and there were around ten people nearby who just walked by and didn’t help.

'One woman did start to approach us but 
then the woman robber put her finger to her head as if to tell her I was
mad and the lady walked away.'

The widower, who who worked at Addenbrooke’s Hospital for 43 years and was honoured by the Royal Humane Society in 1942 for saving a drowning boy from a river, believes the thieves had monitored him while inside the store.

Mr Saxby said: 'I had seen the woman who grabbed my wrist in the supermarket restaurant.

'She had her phone up every time an older person was at the till. I am sure she was filming us putting in our PIN.'

Police hunting the assailants today described them as both wearing dark clothing. The man was of Mediterranean appearance and aged 23-24, while the woman was white and believed to be in her late teens.

A police spokeswoman said: 'This was a callous attack on a vulnerable man and it is vital we trace those responsible.

'Filming people at tills is one tactic used by criminals to get people’s PINs and we urge shoppers to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to police.

'We know a number of people witnessed this incident - I urge them to come forward to report what they saw.'

A spokesman for Tesco said today: 'We were deeply saddened to hear about this and wish Mr Saxby a very speedy recovery. We will of course be assisting police with their investigation in any way we can.'
