Two brothers who were imprisoned for 25 years for the murder of a Detroit marijuana dealer and released last year only to await a retrial and possible re-imprisonment have now had their names cleared for good.

The murder charges against Raymond, 47, and Thomas Highers, 48, will be dismissed thanks to a lack of evidence pinning them to the 1987 crime.

The case is expected to be officially dropped Thursday by Wayne County, Michigan Circuit Court Judge Lawrence Talon, the same judge who ordered the brothers be released after a quarter century in prison on August 13, 2012 after new evidence warranted a retrial.

Talon ordered a new trial for the brothers and let them out on bond after new witness testimony suggested they may have been misidentified in the 1987 slaying of 65-year-old Robert Karey in his east side Detroit home.

Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy appealed the ruling to the state Court of Appeals, which declined to reverse it. The case was scheduled for trial on Oct. 8.

‘Just as we did 26 years ago, we firmly believe in the evidence in this case,’ Worthy said Wednesday in a release. ‘We have worked diligently to bring this case to trial. With the passage of time it is an unfortunate reality that this case cannot be put back together and we must dismiss it.’

The brothers got the news that their 26-year-long saga was over from their attorney. Raymond was at work while Tommy was having lunch with his girlfriend.

The brothers were convicted of killing a 65-year-old drug dealer in 1987, but a new witness came forward in 2012 discounting original testimony. This week, the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office decided not to retry

Justice: 'Being able to correct an injustice, there¿s no greater feeling,' defense attorney Valerie Newman said.'They would have died in prison. It¿s a testament to the human character that they hold no bitterness.'

‘I’m just elated,’ Tommy told the Detroit Free Press. ‘It means a fresh start for me. It means freedom for me to do the things I want to do, to visit family in other states. I have no felony conviction on my record.’

His little brother, of course, agreed.

‘It means freedom and life. It’s been a long day coming,’ Raymond said. ‘Over 26 years, we’ve fought for this, and it’s finally here. It’s like being vindicated.’

Karey was shot to death in his home near Detroit's City Airport. The Highers brothers, now 47, were convicted in 1988 in a non-jury trial of felony murder and assault with intent to murder.

The case was reopened in March 2012 after a man came forward who said he was one of a few Grosse Pointe North High School graduates at Karey's house the night he was shot.

John Hielscher said he was scared at the time to say anything, and didn't learn for two decades that the Highers had been convicted.

Two of the former graduates testified in July 2012 that they went to Karey's back door to buy marijuana. They said they were interrupted by several armed black men who rushed into the backyard and ordered them to leave. The Highers are white.

Prosecutors had questioned the witnesses' credibility throughout the hearing, suggesting there was a conspiracy to free the Highers brothers.

Worthy's decision to seek a dismissal in the case came as a surprise to the brothers, according to Gabi Silver, defense attorney for Thomas Highers.

‘We were geared up and ready for trial,’ Silver told The Associated Press Wednesday afternoon. ‘We're ready. We have all our witnesses lined up. That's not to say that it shouldn't have happened. It should have been dismissed a long time ago.’

Since their release, the Highers are readjusting to life outside prison walls. Both have jobs, she said.

‘I don't think you can ever make up for 20 years behind bars,’ Silver added. ‘You can't give them back their lives. There is nothing that can make up for it.’

'I¿m just elated,' Thomas, 48, said. 'It means a fresh start for me. It means freedom for me to do the things I want to do, to visit family in other states. I have no felony conviction on my record.'
