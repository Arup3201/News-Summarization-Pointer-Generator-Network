A van driver has died after his vehicle flipped onto its roof, leaving him crushed underneath, following a crash with a marked police car.

The 29-year-old man, who has not yet been named, suffered fatal injuries after his Mercedes Sprinter 'pirouetted' 10ft through the air after striking the police car in Coseley, near Dudley, West Midlands.

Six people, including the police driver, tried to lift the 2.5 tonne vehicle off the injured man, who had been delivering sandwiches for a catering company at the time of the crash.

The 29-year-man, who has not yet been named, suffered fatal injuries after his Mercedes Sprinter van flipped onto its roof and crushed him after colliding with a marked police car in Coseley, near Dudley, West Midlands 

Six people, including a police officer, tried to lift the 2.5 tonne vehicle off the casualty following the crash and desperate attempts were made to resuscitate him at the scene but he was pronounced dead a short time later

However, he suffered catastrophic injuries and was pronounced dead by paramedics at the scene a short time later.

West Midlands Police said the marked patrol car was not responding to an emergency call at the time of yesterday's crash and confirmed the police driver, who was carrying out routine inquiries, was uninjured.

Inspector Paul Bennett, from West Midlands Police's regional collision investigation unit, said: 'The man's family has been informed of the collision and will be supported by liaison officers at this difficult time.

'We have launched a full investigation and urge any witnesses to contact us as soon as possible.

'The police officer, who was driving a marked car, was carrying out routine inquiries and was not responding to an emergency incident. He was uninjured but shaken.'

Witness Steve Leary, 44, said he and others battled in vain to save the man's life after the van landed on top of him.

He said they managed to free the casualty before the police officer tried resuscitation attempts until paramedics reached the scene and took over.

He said: 'I had just reversed my car off the driveway to park it in the road.

'I had taken a couple of strides back to the house when I heard a tremendous bang and looked round to see the van pirouette through the air.

'The police officer got out of his car and went to the aid of the other motorist.

The driver was delivering sandwiches for a West Bromwich catering company at the time of the fatal crash

West Midlands Police said the marked car was on routine patrol but was not responding to an emergency call

'I rushed to help him along with a couple of lads who were working on a scaffolding job.

'The van had ended up on its roof a few yards into Martin Close and we were all looking inside for the driver but could not see him.

'By this time other people had arrived to help and six of us lifted the van off him.'

Neighbour Deirdre Wood, 58, a former Wolverhampton City Council worker, added: 'The paramedics worked tirelessly to give the man CPR for around 25 minutes.

'It is horrific, we're all in shock and thinking about that poor man's family.

'The emergency services worked so hard but there was nothing that could be done.

'It is absolutely horrendous, we are all traumatised by what has happened.'

The driver, who has not yet been named, had only just started working for family-run catering company 'Munchies', which delivers sandwiches to local businesses in West Bromwich, West Midlands.

Company director Bal Singh said: 'We are all devastated. He had only been in the job for just over a month - he kept badgering me for a job for ages.

'Eventually a vacancy came up for a delivery driver and we gave him a go, he loved it and said it was the best job in the world.

'He just loved driving and he was killed doing what he enjoyed and just doing his job, going about his day-to-day business.

'He was more of a friend than a colleague and his family are heartbroken, as are we.'

The road in Coseley, West Midlands, was closed for about five hours while police investigations took place

West Midlands Ambulance Service confirmed it sent an ambulance, a paramedic officer, a rapid response car and the air ambulance to the scene.

A spokesman added: 'Crews attended to a collision between two vehicles, one a marked police car.

'Sadly, it quickly became apparent to crews that nothing could be done to save a man involved in the incident.

'He was confirmed dead at the scene.

'The driver of the police vehicle involved was assessed by ambulance staff but did not require hospital treatment.'

The road was closed for about five hours while emergency services worked at the scene and carried out an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the collision.

West Midlands Police confirmed the Independent Police Complaints Commission has been informed of the incident, due to the involvement of the Ford S-Max police vehicle.
