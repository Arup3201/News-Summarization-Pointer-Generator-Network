Getting up at 6am on a Sunday, after a night with a jet-lagged baby is certainly no picnic. However as I made my way to the BBC Big Questions studio in Mile End last weekend, I was fairly buzzing.

The reason was neither the three shots of espresso I'd had nor the promise of television cameras - it was the topic I'd been asked to address. 'Is it selfish to be an older mum?'

Despite my near-visceral reaction that the question is just plain silly, apparently many people still think so. A recent study showed that a staggering 70 per cent of women over the age of 55 are opposed to and uncomfortable with women having babies in their 40s. 

Are older mothers selfish? Or is it really MEN who are selfish, for delaying or avoiding children with long-term partners?

As a new mum who had her first baby at 41, I was slightly wary and unsure what voices and opinions I might find in the BBC studio audience.

The first person I met in the Green Room was a bubbly midwife in her 50s who had her own twin boys at 37.  She said: 'I think the whole idea that these women might be selfish for wanting to be mothers later in life is outrageous. They are amazing.'

Unsurprisingly, with a greeting like that, I warmed to her immediately. Finding ourselves in total agreement, I spent the rest of our precious pre-show time foregoing a make-up touch up and instead asking her for advice on getting my six-month-old-baby to sleep.

After a rather uncomfortable rehearsal debating the merits of being a sports fan (something Peter Hitchens found utterly appalling), host Nicky Campbell kicked off the topic of older mums' egoism.

He immediately sought out the opinion of a male psychologist, (this, despite there being numerous women on the panel, there specifically to address the subject). 

After launching into an explanation that we, as a generation of women, have been lead falsely astray by the likes of Bridget Jones, the doctor proceeded to rattle off statistics about how older mums are at higher risk for babies with genetic problems and defects. 

Interestingly, it was only later in the show he admitted - after a very uncomfortable prodding by the host - that he'd had his own child at 47.  No mention of the genetic problems caused by older dads then, eh? 

The whole debate got better from there. There was a fabulous woman called Ellie who had had her baby at 47 via IVF, and excellent comments from others on the panel and in the gallery.

I was able to reiterate my long-held mantra that the worst thing you can do is to vilify and attack women who have longed to have a baby and not put it off through any factor other than the lack of finding a suitable partner with whom to have a child.

Before we finished, one rather determined and dogged MP insisted on getting his comment on the subject in, despite not being particularly relevant to the topic.

His point? That it would be a grave error for women watching the programme to blithely assume they will be able to have babies well into their 40s.

And that while some women can have babies later in life, most can't. And that you better get on with it then, hadn't you? On that depressing note, we closed the show.

Opinionated: 'I was able to reiterate my long-held mantra that the worst thing you can do is to vilify and attack women who have longed to have a baby and not put it off through any factor other than the lack of finding a suitable partner with whom to have a child'

After a whirlwind morning spent with excellent minds, most far sharper than my own, I am still left with the unanswered question: does ANY thinking woman, in this day and age, really believe she has an unlimited amount of time to have a baby?

And does the above exhortation - warning, threat - really need to be said? After all, study after study shows it's educated women who are leaving it until later.

I would argue that these same intelligent, informed, smart women who struggle to find a partner who is a commitment-comfortable equal are very, very aware of the limitations and challenges of motherhood in one's 40s. 

Every single one of us knows someone intimately who was unable to have a baby because of her age or fertility limitations. Believe me, we have all had a front row seat to that particular pain.

Putting it off: 'I would argue that these same intelligent, informed, smart women who struggle to find a partner who is a commitment-comfortable equal are very, very aware of the limitations and challenges of motherhood in one's 40s'

It is indeed true that more women are having babies later in life than ever before. They are willing to try gruelling hormone injections, invasive procedures, bizarre diets, painful emotional rollercoasters, selecting sperm and egg donors, horrendous adoption red tape and sometimes near financial ruin.

What they are not willing to do is to walk away from the dream of being a mother just because it's bloody hard.

If your goal is to encourage women in their 20s to be mindful of their fertility, I salute you. Indeed, let's all help younger women be aware of how they can preserve this very important part of their womanhood.

However, I don't believe they were the ones tuning into the show for this particular topic yesterday.

And please, let's be a bit more sensitive to the women who are now in the thick of the fight.  

For the most part, and for the women of my generation, it has been a challenge to find men who are not reluctant to commit until their late 30s and 40s.

And, at that time, they are no longer looking for a peer but seeking an 'under 30' because, as I was told many times myself at 36: 'Why would I want a women my own age? I want to have kids.'

Looking back and reflecting on the Big Questions, I believe a better topic might have been, 'Is it selfish to be an older DAD?'

Or perhaps even bette: 'Is it selfish for MEN to delay or avoid fatherhood and commitment with a long-term partner?'
