The Open’s lardy ranks have been depleted by the loss of Darren Clarke, who estimates he is four stone lighter than at last year’s event at Muirfield.

The Northern Irishman, who looks a completely different person to the one that downed a pint of Guinness in celebration at winning the 2006 Ryder Cup, has cut out all sugar and now eats a high protein diet.

Clarke says the turning point came when he saw footage of himself during the Dunhill Links at St Andrews last year and though ‘Christ, I’m fat’.

Trim: Clarke, who looks very different from last year, says he has lost around four stone since October

The 2011 Open champion has been 
hitting the gym five times a week, doing very little cardiovascular 
work, instead concentrating on resistance and heavy weights.

The 45-year-old has turned a size 41 waist to a 32 since embarking on his major fitness and weight loss programme.

'I
 still go out with my mates and enjoy myself and always will,’ Clarke 
told The Telegraph. ‘Yet whereas before I’d have had a dozen pints of 
Guinness, now I’ll have one or two pints... and 10 gin and tonics. So 
the outcome is still very merry, with much less calories.'

Clarke
 famously downed a pint of Guinness on the club balcony at The K Club in
 Straffan after Europe triumphed in the 2006 Ryder Cup.

'I’m twice as strong as I was before and feel much better, not just physically, but mentally.

'The
 only source of frustration is that the golf ball hasn’t yet realised 
all the work I’ve been doing. My timing has been off, obviously because 
I’ve lost all that weight and what have you and my swing has to 
compensate.

'Recently
 I’ve actually been hitting the ball well and scoring terribly. But I’ve
 always been driven, way too much so and I can assure you that I 
wouldn’t be doing all this if I didn’t think I couldn’t still play, 
didn’t think I could still play at the top level.

I’m just going to carry on grafting, stand on that range and carry on ripping it, and wait until it turns around on the course.'
