David Cameron once declared he wanted to 'let sunshine win the day’.

The Prime Minister today certainly appeared to have spent more time soaking up the rays than his Chancellor George Osborne, who looked rather pale next to his tanned boss.

They arrived on a building site at the M1 Junction 19 in Leicestershire wearing an array of 
safety gear and equipment which may bring to mind more a nuclear fallout
 than a construction area, with a bronzed Mr Cameron still glowing from a week in the Lanzarote sun.

The two senior Conservatives had earlier made a rare joint appearance in Hertfordshire to announce a raft of new building schemes.

The two men have avoided appearing in 
public together since the coalition was formed, to avoid the much-mocked
 impression that they are two ‘arrogant posh boys’ running the country 
together.

However, the 
dramatic return to economic growth and tumbling unemployment numbers has
 given the Conservative duo confidence to share a platform in front of 
the cameras.

In 
government they have only been seen side-by-side when Mr Osborne has 
delivered Budget statements in the Commons, or at events involving other
 ministers.

Today they 
claimed more than 150,000 jobs could be created by £36 billion of 
infrastructure projects being started in the UK this year.

The two men have not appeared together as a double-act since the general election, but took part in a question and answer session at the construction company Skanska in Rickmansworth

The two men appeared at the construction company Skanska in Rickmansworth, England.

They claimed that more than 200 rail, road, local transport, broadband, airport and waste management projects are due to start construction over the next year.

Flood defences are also on the list after a winter of devastating weather left several areas under water.

However, Labour dismissed the announcement, claiming it amounted to just 10 per cent of the £375 billion of infrastructure investment announced in December.

Mr Cameron jetted off to Lanzarote last week with his family, where he was seen relaxing in shorts and taking a dip in the sea.

But in a moment of drama, the Prime Minister was stung by a jellyfish as he swum on the Spanish island's popular Arrieta beach.

Tourists told how he came running out of the water in his blue swimming trunks rubbing his arm.

Mr Cameron stayed with his wife Samantha and their three children at a £200-a-night yoga retreat at the resort.  They returned to the UK at the weekend.

The Prime Minister has ordered a major push on projects to get Britain building.

‘Ensuring Britain has first class infrastructure is a crucial part of our long-term economic plan: supporting business, creating jobs and providing a better future for hardworking people,’ Mr Cameron said.

‘As a crucial part of our long-term economic plan, this Government is backing business with better infrastructure so that more jobs and opportunities are created for hardworking people, meaning more financial security and peace of mind for families.’

Mr Osborne added: ‘Because of the tough decisions we have taken in day-to-day spending, we can prioritise public investment where it is most needed and create the right conditions for private investment in infrastructure where it brings value for the taxpayer.

‘So this year over 200 new projects worth an estimated £36 billion are due to start, creating thousands of jobs, securing future growth and delivering the world class infrastructure Britain deserves.’

The £36 billion estimate is made up of £5 billion in public investment, £21 billion private and £10 billion in joint funding.

But Labour’s shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie said: ‘We need action not words on infrastructure if we're to get a recovery built to last.

‘Under David Cameron and George Osborne, despite multiple infrastructure plans and reheated announcements like today's, infrastructure output in the economy is down more than 10%.

‘The Government's overall infrastructure pipeline in December showed fewer than a quarter of projects 'in construction'.

‘We are seeing the lowest peacetime level of house-building since the 1920s and more cuts are planned to capital spending next year.

‘Investors need certainty and delivery, not just another load of warm words.’
