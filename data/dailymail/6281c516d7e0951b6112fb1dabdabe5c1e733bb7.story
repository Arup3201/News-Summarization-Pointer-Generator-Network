The parents of Reeva Steenkamp today backed calls for Shrien Dewani to give evidence over the murder of Anni Dewani - supporting her parents' campaign to ensure the case is not dismissed.

Barry and June Steenkamp urged the judge to make the accused face justice on Monday, and offered their condolences to Vinod and Nilam Hindocha whose daughter, like Reeva, was shot dead in South Africa.

Mr Steenkamp and Mr Hindocha spoke on the telephone from Port Elizabeth and Cape Town and discussed the similarities in their cases.

Both their daughters, who were in their twenties, were gunned down with their partners accused of their murders in incidents which shocked South Africa and threw the country's record of gun violence into the spotlight.

The killings, more than two years apart, put the South African legal system under huge scrutiny as Reeva's killer was cleared of murder despite firing four bullets and Shrien Dewani may walk free on Monday without offering any defence.

Cleared? Oscar Pistorius was cleared of murdering girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp but found guilty of manslaughter while Shrien Dewani, who is accused of killing his wife, will find out if he is to stand trial on Monday

Reeva was shot dead by athlete Oscar Pistorius, the double amputee who made history by competing in both the Paralympics and Olympics of London 2012.

He was cleared of murder, but found guilty of culpable homicide and given a five-year prison sentence after he claimed he mistook Reeva for an intruder as they slept.

Shrien Dewani is on trial for murdering Anni who was killed by a single bullet to the neck with her husband accused of masterminding and staging the shooting to look like a robbery.

The Western Cape Court will decide on Monday whether the Bristol millionaire businessman can walk free with no case to answer or whether his trial must continue.

He has applied for the charge against him to be dismissed claiming the prosecution have no evidence against him and he should not need to offer any defence.

Mr Steenkamp confirmed to MailOnline that he and his wife are supporting Anni's parents in their bid to get the judge to continue the case and have offered their sympathy.

Mr Hindocha said today: 'I am delighted that Reeva's parents have said they will support us and am very grateful for that.

'Mr Steenkamp and I talked about Reeva and Anni and I gave him my sympathy too.

'Only he and I as fathers can properly understand the pain of losing a daughter to bullets and then experience very difficult and high profile cases.

Sham: Shrien and Anni Dewani married in a Hindu wedding that her parents described as 'false' after he was discovered to have been sleeping with gay prostitutes 

Rage: Oscar Pistorius was accused of shooting Reeva Steenkamp dead in a fit of rage but the judge found that he mistook her for an intruder 

'Reeva's father told me 'we are both in the same boat' and that I needed to be strong. He and his family had been following our case.

'He hoped that we would get the right to hear the full case here and that he felt for us.

'I told him I am very sorry about what happened to Reeva and I know there is to be an appeal against the judge's decision in the Pistorius case and they also have our support on that.'

The Steenkamps are unhappy with the outcome of the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius and are appealing against the verdict and the sentence given to the athlete who is known as 'Blade Runner.'

He shot his model girlfriend Reeva during the middle of the night in his Pretoria home on Valentine's Day last year after she made a last minute decision to spend the night, having told her flat mate she would be returning.

He claimed he thought an intruder had entered his home, but Reeva was gunned down with four bullets piercing the toilet door where she had locked herself inside.

Pistorius denied murder and was cleared by Judge Thokozile Masipa who ruled he did not intend to kill when he unleashed four bullets.

Instead, she decided he had acted negligently and was guilty of the lesser manslaughter charge.

So strong: Nilam Hindocha, who lost her daughter on honeymoon, and June Steenkamp, whose daughter Reeva was killed on Valentine's Day last year, have fought for justice for their girls 

Justice for Anni: Honeymoon murder victim Anni's father, Vinod, is campaigning for Shrien to face trial 

Grief: Reeva's father Barry Steenkamp, who had his head in his hands when evidence of his daughter's treatment was heard, has spoken to Anni's father Vinod to offer his condolences

His five-year sentence means he could be released after serving 10 months in jail to complete the sentence under house arrest at his uncle's home, a punishment described as 'shockingly light' by prosecutors.

If Pistorius is found guilty of murder on appeal, he would face a minimum of 15 years in prison, but his defence team is gearing up for another court battle.

Dewani denies any involvement in his wife's murder and claims he is being framed by the real killers, three men who organised the car jacking and robbery without his knowledge.

Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni, the gunman, was given 25 years for Anni's murder.  Zola Tongo received 18 years following a plea agreement. Qwabi and Tongo are state witnesses and accuse him of organising the shooting of Anni in Gugulethu township on November 13 2010. Mngeni has died in custody from a brain tumour.

Anni died in the back of a taxi on honeymoon when two men attacked the vehicle and took it over at gunpoint, releaseing Dewani and driver Tongo.

Tongo later told police he had been hired by Dewni for £1400 to enlist the gangsters and stage a robbery and carjacking.

Anni's family are in the centre of a campaign to press the judge Jeanette Traverso to throw out Dewani's claim to have the case dismissed on Monday.

Her brother Anish said: 'We just want the whole story and after four years, not many people would deny us that. It would be disgraceful if Shrien is allowed out of South Africa without going through a full trial and telling us what happened.

'We need to hear his story so that we can receive closure and try and move on with our lives'.
