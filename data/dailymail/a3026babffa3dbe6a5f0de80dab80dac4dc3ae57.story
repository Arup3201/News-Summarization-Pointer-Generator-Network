The great-grandson of Lord Baden-Powell, founder of the world-wide Scout Movement, has appeared in court for the first time since he was charged with his wife's murder in Australia today.

His appearance came after numerous reports that 40-year-old Gerard Baden-Clay had been having an affair in the months before the death of his wife, Allison, 43.

The murder charge was brought at a Brisbane police station on Wednesday night shortly after Mr Baden-Clay's lawyer, Mr Darren Mahoney, announced that that was the intention of murder squad detectives.

Mystery: Allison Baden-Clay is the wife of Gerard Baden-Clay, the great grandson of Scout movement founder Lord Robert Baden-Powell. He has now been charged with her murder

He stood with his back to the public 
gallery at Brisbane's Roma Street complex for the hearing that lasted 
just a matter of minutes.

After a health check-up, he was put into his cell for his first night in jail.

None of his family was at the short hearing and he appeared to be wearing the same shirt he wore when he was arrested.

He will appear before the court again on July 9 when there will be a committal hearing.

'He's devastated,' said Mr Mahoney.

Mr Gerard Baden-Clay, 40, was taken 
by homicide squad detectives to a Brisbane police station and told his 
lawyer that he was being charged with the murder of his former beauty 
queen wife Allison, 43.

Detectives had earlier called at Mr 
Baden-Clay's house and placed him under arrest before driving him to a 
police station where preparations were made to charge him with murder.

The mother of three's disappearance 
from her home after she set out for a late night walk on April 20 
sparked a massive police search.

Her body was found on the banks of a creek a half hour's drive from her home 10 days later.

Mr Baden-Clay has made much of his relationship to Lord Baden-Powell, making reference to it on his real estate agent's website.

Following the discovery of Mrs 
Baden-Clay's body a Brisbane newspaper claimed that her husband had been
having an affair in the months leading up to her murder.

A Brisbane newspaper claimed that it 
was in Mr Baden-Clay's real estate office that an affair had started 
with a saleswoman - and that relationship had been the focus of police 
investigations.

According to the newspaper, staff at 
the real estate office reported seeing Mr Baden-Clay leaving the woman's
home after hours. There was also disquiet over perceptions that the 
woman was receiving preferential treatment with new property listings.

What happened? Mr Baden-Clay told police that he last saw his wife when they went to sleep together. When he woke up in the morning she was gone

The paper said tensions in the office
came to a head around the middle of last year when Mr Baden-Clay told 
employees that Allison had discovered the affair.

Mrs Baden-Clay, a former Queensland 
beauty queen, is said to have denied to friends that her husband had 
been having an affair and that she wanted her marriage to work.

'She did everything she could to make a happy home,' a source told the Sunday Mail in Brisbane.

The investigation into the murder of Mrs Baden-Clay captured the attention of Australia.

'This is a case of an innocent whose 
tragic story has captured hearts,' said Queensland Police Commissioner 
Bob Atkinson as detectives continued inquiries into the woman's murder.

There were some crimes that grip the 
public's imagination, he said, adding: 'This is clearly a case with 
significant public interest.'

Mr Baden-Clay's lawyer said after his
revelation that his client was being charged with murder that he would 
'defend the charge vigorously.'
