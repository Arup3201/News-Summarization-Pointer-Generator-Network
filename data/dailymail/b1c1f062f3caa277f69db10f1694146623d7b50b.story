Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino has signalled a change in the club’s transfer policy by stepping up his bid to sign two young British defenders along side Croatian World Cup player Dejan Lovren.

Pochettino has his eye on Nottingham Forest’s 20-year-old defender Jamaal Lascelles, valued at £6million, and left-back Ben Davies of Swansea City.

Hot property: Spurs are among a string of clubs chasing Nottingham Forest defender Jamaal Lascelles

He is also chasing Lovren, a player he knows from former club Southampton.

Lovren is seen as successor to club captain Michael Dawson — close to joining Hull.

Centre-back Lascelles made 34 
first-team appearances for Forest last season and has gained 
international recognition with England at youth level.

However, Spurs face competition from Premier League rivals QPR for his signature after the west Londoners made a £4m offer.
