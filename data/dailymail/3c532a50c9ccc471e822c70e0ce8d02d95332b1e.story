Writing on her ask.fm site, Paris added: 'So i realized dat some ppl dont like my mom and im getting hateful comments about sayin obviously rude things about my mom and i won't let that okay?

'I am bonding good with her and like i said we are really strong relationship and nobody's gonna stop me from that (: x yes Prince still isn't ready idk why but he will meet her too (: i hope so no hate! xx '

The teen had revealed that she was back in touch with her mom, writing: 'So on my birthday, I hung out with my mom
 because of course, haven't seen her since... a long time ago. So glad I
 bonded with my mother. It's like we have this really strong 
relationship and did I mention, I kind of look like her. It was so 
amazing to see my mother after all these years. Love her.'

But when one critic said her mom was only out to use her, Paris replied: 'Well wtf are u messing in my life?

'Stfu im sick of ppl like u who are saying that! She wasn't in my life around 15 years but now as i said we became close and i know that she wouldn't use me cuz im her daughter kay?'

Paris was taken from her Calabasas family home on a stretcher

The teen was listed 
as a potential witness in a massive lawsuit currently being brought by 
the Jackson family against AEG – the concert promoters behind her late 
father Michael’s doomed tour This Is It.

The family, who want
 $40 billion, say superstar Michael died from an overdose of 
prescription drugs after a punishing schedule of rehearsals prior to the
 tour.

The trial which 
began in LA in April is scheduled to last three months. Paris’s older 
brother Prince, 16, is also prepared to take the witness stand. 

Michael Jackson died in June 2009 aged 50 after suffering a
heart attack brought on  from an overdose of propofol and
benzodiazepine.

In recent months, Paris has become increasingly close to her mother, Michael Jackson’s second wife, Debbie Rowe.

Mother and daughter have been pictured spending time together amid 
reports Paris will move in with her mother at her Palmdale ranch in 
California over the summer months.

Rowe,
 54, met Michael when she was a nurse for Dr Arnold Klein, the singer’s 
dermatologist. The pair married when she was six months pregnant with 
Prince in November 1996.

The
 following year she gave birth to Paris. The couple divorced in 1999 and
 Rowe accepted an $8million settlement and gave full custody to the 
popstar.

Music producer Russell Simmons has tweeted his support to the Jackson family, writing: 'My prayers are with Paris Jackson and her family at this time.'

Meanwhile Michael Jackson's former lawyer Tom Mesereau, who represented the singer during his 2005 child molestation trial, said he is 'heartbroken over the news.He told RadarOnline: 'I'm heartbroken over Paris Jackson’s suicide attempt. I’m shocked, and frankly, at a loss for words.'Paris is just a wonderful young lady, beautiful, and extremely bright.'
