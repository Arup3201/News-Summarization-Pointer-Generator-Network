It looks like it's all over for these tree frogs in this spine-tingling image.

As they bask in the Indonesian sunshine, a crocodile looms behind them, jaws outstretched.

But miraculously, the predator changes his mind at the last second, and simply comes to rest beside them.

As they bask in the Indonesian sunshine, a crocodile looms behind the two unaware frogs

The amphibians had been blissfully unaware of their potentially imminent death.

In the images, the silent reptile looks intent on eating his prey - but in fact it was trying to cool down rather than grab its next meal.

Fahmi Bhs, 39, took the incredible series of pictures after spending about four hours photographing animals in the area.

He watched as the crocodile slowly approached the frogs, opening its jaws and seemingly threatening to swallow them whole.

But the reptile was actually trying to 
cool itself down - opening its mouth to regulate its body temperature 
after spending the morning basking in the hot sun.

Danger: They continue to sit without a care in the world

Miraculously, he then backs down and comes to rest beside the little creatures

Fahmi, of Jakarta, Indonesia, said: 'The croc did not want to eat them, but I witnessed this very creature pouncing on a small chicken with incredible speed afterwards!

'What I like about this image is that it seems so unusual. Everybody would consider a crocodile capturing frogs as normal or habitual.

'They do eat frogs in the wilderness but this image somehow creates the impression that they shouldn't just eat anything.

'But this is a delusional idea from people who love twisting the reality of a photo like this to comfort their mind.'
