A reality TV star who appeared on Geordie Shore has pleaded guilty to assault after throwing her shoes at a woman in a bar.

Vicky Pattison attacked Hannah Kelso because she thought the teenager had thrown ice at her and another cast member.

The fight took place last summer at Florita's Bar in Newcastle.

Pattison, 25, from nearby Wallsend, accused Miss Kelso, 18, of throwing ice at her while sitting in a booth at the venue.

But after staff stepped in to break up the argument she threw her shoes, with one hitting Miss Kelso and the other a security guard.

The teenager received a cut under her eye which required four stitches, and the worker was left with a lump and cut to the lip.

Fight: The assault took place at Florita's Bar in Newcastle in July last year

Guilty: But a judge said that he would not sentence the 25-year-old to prison

Anthony O'Donohoe, mitigating, said Pattison did not mean to injure her and she admitted it was a reckless act.

He said the defendant and her friends mistakenly thought the ice had come from the booth Miss Kelso was in.

Granting
 her bail, Judge Brian Forster QC said he would sentence Pattison next 
month but told her that he would not be passing a custodial sentence.

He
 said: 'I have looked at the summary of this case, I take into account 
your character and can indicate the court will not consider any form of 
custodial sentence.'

During the hearing at Newcastle Crown Court, she pleaded not guilty to a charge of affray.

At the time of the incident in July last year, Pattison was suspended from the MTV show, which will soon begin its eighth series.
