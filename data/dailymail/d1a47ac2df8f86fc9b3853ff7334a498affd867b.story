One of the world's most prestigious (and most visited) department stores - Galeries Lafayette in Paris - has listed itself on Airbnb for a once-in-a-lifetime sleepover opportunity.

Six lucky guests will have the chance to spend the night in the store on January 6 - and be first in line when the Winter Sale starts on January 7.

Their stay will begin at 8pm on the 6th and will include a private tour, personal shopping advice and a €200 voucher to spend.

Six lucky guests will win the chance to spend the night in the iconic Galeries Lafayette department store

The winners will sleep under the century-old glass dome in one of the prêt-a-porter departments

The chosen six will also benefit from a first look at sale items and a luxurious dinner.

There are also two triple rooms, located in one of the prêt-a-porter departments, where guests will then spend the night in comfortable beds under the famous, century-old glass dome. 

The next morning, after a typical French breakfast, they will take part in the official launch of the Sale and then make their purchases before heading home. 

The department store is known for its intricate glass dome - and its high quality fashion offerings, of course

The six guests will have the chance to puruse the sale first and receive personalised shopping advice

For your chance to win, enter the contest before midnight on December 28.

In 100 words, explain - in French or English - why you should be the one to stay one night in the Galeries Lafayette.

Six winners will be selected from the submissions, chosen entirely on merit. 

A luxe dinner and fabulous French breakfast will also be included in the overnight stay

To enter, simply submit a 100-word piece explaining why you should be the one to stay overnight there

Even if the entrant is not Paris-based, all transportation costs will be covered and a €200 voucher provided

Judging criteria is as follows: 70 per cent based on the originality and creativity of the submission and 30 per cent based on the spirit of the submission, meaning how it relates to fashion.

Not based in Paris? No problem.

Transportation to the French capital will also be provided. 

The stay will take place on January 6 - before the official start of their Winter Sale on January 7

This is the latest addition to Airbnb's 'A Night At' initiative, designed to unlock unexpected places 

One hundred thousand visitors are expected through the doors of Galeries Lafayette during the store's much-anticipated seasonal Sale.

This is the latest addition to Airbnb's 'A Night At' initiative, designed to unlock places around the world where it's never before been possible to spend the night.

So far, these have included an IKEA store in Australia, a KLM plane in Amsterdam and a Waterstones book store in the UK.
