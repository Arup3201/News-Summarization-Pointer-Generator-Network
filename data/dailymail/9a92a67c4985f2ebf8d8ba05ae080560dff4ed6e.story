Cyberbullying at schools is rife with more than two-thirds of teachers saying they've seen pupils trolling and bullying each other online.

And almost half of teachers admit they feel unprepared to tackle the problem.

A YouGov poll of 701 teachers also revealed that a shocking 73 per cent fear sexting, grooming and cyberbullying is on the rise at schools.

Meanwhile almost half of teachers (42 per cent) admitted they have never taught e-safety, while almost a third (30 per cent) say they would feel out of their depth tackling it in class.

As well as bullying and trolling, 42 per cent of secondary school teachers said they had seen students sexting.

Teachers also admitted being in the dark about what pupils use their smartphones for, with 43 per cent saying they don't understand the apps their pupils use at school.

Online child safety expert Professor Andy Phippen said: 'This research suggests that schools may not be doing enough to protect pupils from the dangers of the digital world.

'Further training, technology and resources are needed to support teachers as more and more students carry powerful tablets and smartphones into school.

'Equally, it is important that we teach pupils about the safe use of the internet, rather than simply banning technology in schools, which, while perhaps seeming like an easy option, is actually preventing the fantastic opportunities mobile tech provides for both formal and informal learning.'

The research comes as Point2Protect launches a new e-safety service for schools with support from the UK Safer Internet Centre, to help schools manage these online threats. The service is more advanced than typical 'stop and block' e-safety tools. For the first time schools can understand how pupils are using the internet on all the devices they carry.

Ian Skeels, Director of Point2Protect, a company that designs internet safety systems and commissioned the research, said: 'For too long there's been confusion between government, schools, and parents over whose responsibility it is to protect young people from harmful online content, both within the classroom and beyond.

'Our service provides the transparent oversight schools need to identify potential issues and start a positive, open dialogue between teachers and pupils about appropriate online behaviour.'
