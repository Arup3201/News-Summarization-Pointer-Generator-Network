A mother has released harrowing pictures of her 18-year-old son in a coma after he was violently kicked in the head by a thug during a brawl.

Marco Baccellini, 18, from Leicester nearly died after he was violently kicked in the head by Ryan Gallagher, 17, as he lay defenceless on the ground. 

A court has heard thug Gallagher was egged on by friends who filmed the 'horrific' attack on a mobile phone and could be heard repeatedly saying: 'Bang him, Ryan.'

Gallagher was yesterday sentenced to four year's detention at Leicester Crown Court.

Speaking outside court following the sentencing, Mr Baccellini's mother Joanne Greenwood said 'there are no winners here.'

The court heard after the attack Mr Baccellini underwent two life-saving operations for bleeding on his brain and was put into a coma for days.

He was in intensive care and then a high dependency unit for several weeks at Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham.

Ms Greenwood, 36, from Leicester, said: 'There are no winners here, and lessons have to be learnt by young men not to let petty arguments fester into extreme violence.'

She added: 'Although my son almost died, he is now on a long road to recovery.

'I also feel for the defendants' parents, as they're suffering too.'

Gallagher, from Leicester, admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent on the evening of September 18 last year.

Ben Hayes, 17, from Leicester, admitted aiding and abetting Gallagher. 

He was sentenced to eight months' detention and training order without parole.

Alan Murphy, prosecuting, told the court there was a long-running dispute between slightly-built Mr Baccellini and Gallagher, who was physically  bigger and stronger.

Two weeks before the brawl they had a fight, where Mr Baccellini came off worse.

A re-match was then arranged at a local basketball court.

Mr Baccellini was urged to take part by a friend he was staying with - and who the prosecution said had a 'moral responsibility' for what happened.

Mr Baccellini, who had been drinking and taken MCat, ignored his girlfriend's pleas not to go.

Mr Murphy said: 'There were about 10 people aged 16 to 20 years and two smaller children, aged seven or eight, at the scene.'

The court heard Mr Baccellini rushed at Gallagher, who grabbed him in a head-lock, punched him and threw him to the ground, causing 'an audible crack'.

At the same time Hayes shouted words of encouragement to Gallagher and insulted Mr Baccellini, who lay inert on the ground visibly bleeding from a head wound.

Mr Baccellini was encouraged to get up and while he was still dazed his friend urged him to continue.

Gallagher then punched Mr Baccellini and as he lay bleeding, kicked him in the head.

No-one at the scene called an ambulance until staff from a local Co-op shop intervened and rang 999.

'Horrific' footage of the incident was later sent by Hayes to three friends and was later seen by Mr Baccellini's mother.

Some of the defendants' relatives chose not to see the footage when it was played in court.

The court heard that neither defendant had previous convictions and their families, although 'shocked' by their actions, were in court to support their sons.

Carl Gaskell, mitigating for Gallagher, said: 'It was at first a consensual fight but I don't dispute it developed into something more serious. 

'He's remorseful and ashamed.'

Andrew Fryman, for Hayes, said: 'He now realises it was wrong and has shown remorse for the victim.

'If he could turn the clock back he would have left his mobile phone in his pocket and encouraged Gallagher to walk away.'

Judge Robert Brown told Gallagher and Hayes in sentencing: 'Gallagher, you were much bigger than the victim and you knew he was no match for you.

'You bullied him and even when he was defenceless your attack continued.

'It's been described as brutal and I agree.

'I've viewed the footage of the attack.

'Both of you hung your heads in shame (in the dock) at what you'd done.

'Gallagher, you threw him to the ground and punched him.

'He managed to get to his feet when he was semi-conscious.

'After a short time you continued the attack and punched him.

'When he was on the floor you kicked him to the head, when he was unconscious or semi-conscious - either way he was unable to defend himself.

'There were two separate areas of bleeding to his brain and his injuries were life threatening, along with a punctured lung.

'It's difficult for the doctors to know whether he will make a complete recovery, not least due to further complications of further injury to his head two months later, which has nothing to do with you, although the injuries you caused made him more susceptible.'

The judge lifted a court order banning the juvenile defendants from being named 'in the public interest.'

Mr Baccellini, now 19, suffered seizures during his recovery and his prognosis remains uncertain.

Leicester Crown Court heard two months after the attack by Gallagher, Mr Baccellini suffered another head injury - either by a fall or another assault unconnected with the defendants. 

Mr Baccellini, who has no memory of the second incident, is currently in hospital recovering.

His grandmother, Elaine Greenwood, 52,told the Leicester Mercury that his progress was 'slow' and the incident has had a 'devastating effect'. 

She said: 'Marco’s progress is slow, he couldn’t even send a text message the other day as his arm was so weak.'
