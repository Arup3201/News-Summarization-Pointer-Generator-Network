Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott warns the government has 'absolute determination' to prevent 'returning jihadis' who are a threat to the country.

The PM's call to protect the nation's borders from extremists comes as the Weekend Australian reveals a handful of Australians are participating in executions of captured Iraqi prisoners in the war torn country.

Several Australian Islamists, including a convicted terrorist, have appeared in social media images carrying out bloodied executions during the two-week Iraqi insurgency. The group are believed to be fighting with the extremist Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS).

Prime Minister Tony Abbott warns Australia will do its 'damnedest' to ensure the 'returning jihadis' never come back to the country

Mr Abbott believed up to 100 Australians are involved in groups fighting in Iraq and Syria: 'Some of them are involved with this murderous, murderous AL-Qaeda splinter group,' Mr Abbott said, (referring to theÂ  ISIS). Some of them are involved in atrocities.'

He said Australia can't afford to have 'trained killers who hate our way of life, who hate us, making mischief with the potential to cause mayhem in our country'.

A spokesman for Defence Minister David Johnston confirmed that a small Australian Defence Force 'liaison element' had been sent to Iraq to bolster security arrangements at the embassy in the country's capital Baghdad.

Mr Abbott said Australia can't have 'trained killers who hate our way of life, who hate us, making mischief with the potential to cause mayhem in our country'.

'The important thing is to ensure that as far as is humanly possible, they don't come back into our country,' he told Macquarie Radio on Friday.

'And if they do come back into our country, (that) they are taken into detention.

'Secure borders is not just a question of stopping the illegal (asylum-seeker) boats that have been coming to our country under Labor,' Mr Abbott said.

'It's also a question of ensuring that we don't get these jihadists coming back to our country trained up in the techniques of death and destruction.'

Australia will do its 'damnedest' to ensure they never come back to the country, he said.

'And if there are some that we have to take back, we will make sure that they are not a threat to the Australian community,' he said.

He said the opposition had been offered a briefing on the government's plans to stop returning jihadists.

'I think that (Opposition Leader) Bill Shorten is just as keen as I am to ensure that when it comes to protecting our country against this kind of thing, we are of one mind,' Mr Abbott said.
