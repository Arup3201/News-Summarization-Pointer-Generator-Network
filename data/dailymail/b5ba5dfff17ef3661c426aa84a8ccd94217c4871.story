A Christian teacher and pastor who decided to give up God as part of a 12-month experiment to explore atheism has lost two teaching jobs in the past week and is now struggling to support his two daughters.

Ryan Bell, 42, has seen drastic consequences from his 'intellectual experiment' which began on January 1.

He was been fired from two Christian schools near his Los Angeles home and is now worried how he will take care of his young daughters, aged 10 and 13.

Christian teacher Ryan Bell has been fired from two California schools after announcing he would live as an atheist for one year as an experiment

Mr Bell decided to conduct the experiment, where he will address his doubts about the Bible and his faith, after he was ordered to step down as a pastor at the Seventh-Day Adventist Church in Hollywood last year.

He plans to not attend church or pray as part of abstaining from his Christian faith.

The 42-year-old said that his liberal 
views, including campaigning against the same-sex marriage ban for gay 
and lesbians, did not go down well with the church.

He said: 'It’s like when you go to a movie and you suspend disbelief for three hours to get inside the story. I’m suspending my belief in God to see what atheism is all about.'

He told CNN: 'There have been times, usually late at 
night and early in the morning, when I think: What have I done? It 
really undermines the whole structure of your life, your career, your 
family.'

Mr Bell has decided to step outside his Christian faith for a year and explore atheism

Mr Bell has set up a blog 'Year Without God - a former pastor's journey into atheism' which attaches to a PayPal account where supporters can donate. 

An atheist blogger has set up an online 
fundraiser for the out-of-work, father-of-two. In one day, around 900 
people donated $19,000 to help Mr Bell.

As part of his experiment into atheism, Mr Bell intends to attend gatherings of non-believers and read the works of religious skeptics such as Friedrich Nietzsche and Richard Dawkins.

Instead of praying for the sick, for example, he intends to do something practical to support them instead.
