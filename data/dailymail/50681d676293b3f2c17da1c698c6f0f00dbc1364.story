Boston Public school officials are scrambling to appease outraged parents after handing out free condoms with suggestive messages deemed by many to be inappropriate for teens.

Condoms with messages such as ‘hump one,’ ‘enjoy one,’ ‘one lucky lady, ‘tasty one’ and a picture of a shark going after a small fish were donated by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, but have since been returned after angry parents voiced their concern.

‘I was horrified,’ mother Helen Dajer told the Boston Globe. ‘As a mother of three teenagers, there was no way I wanted my kids to be given condoms with those wrappers.’

Inappropriate: Many parents were infuriated over the wrappers on condoms being handed out in Boston Public Schools to their teen children

‘We made the decision to take all of those condoms out of school circulation and to go with some that had different, generic wrappers,’ a schools spokesperson told WBZ.

‘Right idea, wrong execution,’ mother Stephanie Bode told the Globe. ‘I so fully support condoms in the schools, and it was incredibly courageous for BPS to adopt the policy.’

Officials are not sure how many of the 40,000 condoms were handed out to students, they admitted, but said a new shipment of about 20,000 was on the way.

‘We support BPS’s decision to replace these condoms with neutrally-packaged condoms,’ health officials said in a statement.

Global Protection Corp., the company that makes the condoms, has offered to donate the new generic condoms free of charge, a company spokesperson told the paper.

BPS began handing out free condoms last year, according to reports, but parents have the right of refusal to prevent their children from getting access to the prophylactics.
