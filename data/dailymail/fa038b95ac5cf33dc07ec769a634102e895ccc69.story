The past 75 years has seen it all: man walking on the moon, the first female Prime Minister, hemlines rising and falling, recessions, more recessions and plenty of Royal celebrations.

But according to nostalgic Brits, nothing can trump the music, fashion and sporting successes of the Sixties as they vote it the best of all the past eight decades.

Three quarters of those polled cited the music scene as the reason they would love to have lived in - or are glad they experienced - the Swinging Sixties, while the next biggest group named culture, fashion and sporting events as the reason they rate the Sixties.

The Sixties music scene, led by Liverpudlian band The beatles, is the reason why 84% of people voted for the 60¿s as the best decade to live in

The study, which asked Brits to recall their fondest iconic moments and memories from the past eight decades, found that with 40 per cent of the votes, Sixties legends The Beatles are unrivalled when it comes to best British band. Queen and The Rolling Stones are next in line.

Even the younger generations quizzed are fans of Sixties music too, with over a quarter of 18-24-year-olds voting for The Beatles over new bands.

When it comes to sporting victories, even after a spectacular summer of sport in 2012, almost a third of the nation still hold onto the 1966 Football World Cup win as the greatest sporting moment of the past 75 years.

Would you rather be living in the Sixties than today?

1984 Winter Olympic winners Torvill & Dean, perhaps surprisingly, skated into second position, eclipsing other Olympic legends such as Sir Steve Redgrave and our 2012 hero, Bradley Wiggins.

And as for fashion favourites, the miniskirt, ‘Little Black Dress’ and bikini are the nation’s highest rated looks of the past 75 years - although men were six times more likely to vote for the bikini, and twice as likely to vote for the miniskirt than women.

The survey, conducted by Nescafé Original to celebrate its 75th anniversary, also found that the Little Black Dress, elevated to iconic status by Audrey Hepburn in the 1961 film Breakfast At Tiffany’s, is the undisputed fashion favourite of women, suggesting a true classic will stand the test of time and remain iconic for generations to come.
