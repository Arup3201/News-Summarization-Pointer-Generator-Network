Eugenie Bouchard recovered from a second-set collapse to become the first player to progress to the quarter-finals of the Australian Open on Sunday.

Bouchard was cruising at a set and a double break up against world No 42 Irina-Camelia Begu but was taken to a deciding set before eventually coming through 6-1, 5-7, 6-2.

The victory ensures a mouthwatering last-eight clash in Melbourne on Tuesday between Bouchard and Maria Sharapova, which would be their first meeting since the latter won their semi-final match in three sets at Roland Garros last year.

Bouchard, 20, said: 'I definitely look forward to that match. I think it's always great to play the best players in the world. We've had a couple matches, and a good match last year. I think I was close. It was just a tough battle.

'But I think I've progressed a lot since then, and I definitely want to keep playing my game no matter what. Really kind of take it to her, go for my shots. That's what I want to do on the court. And it's more fun when I play that way, too.'

The Canadian seventh seed was bidding to reach her fourth quarter-final in the last five Grand Slam events, while Romanian Begu was playing her first ever last-16 match at one of the sport's four majors.

Although Begu had a break point in the first game, Bouchard held and then raced to the opening set in 29 minutes for the loss of just one game.

Bouchard's fan club, the 'Genie Army', were in fine voice when their favourite went 3-0 up with a double break in the second set but the momentum then rapidly swung and Begu reeled off five games in a row.

Begu failed to serve out the set at 5-3 as she was broken to love and also failed to convert two set points in the next game but she finally levelled the match on her third as Bouchard hit a double fault.

Bouchard took a toilet break and came back out refocused, immediately breaking at the start of the deciding set and in the end she eased across the finish line in two hours and six minutes.

She said: 'I gave myself a good long hard look at the mirror [during the toilet break] and said "Genie, this is unacceptable" and I kicked myself in the butt.

'It's disappointing for me because I want to play so well and I want to be perfect. That's not possible. I think I started being a bit less aggressive, a bit too passive and that's not my game at all. I don't do well when that happens.

'But I learned a lot from it and I'll try to make sure it doesn't happen next time. I'm happy that I could regroup and play a bit better tennis in the third. I want to build on that for the next match.'
