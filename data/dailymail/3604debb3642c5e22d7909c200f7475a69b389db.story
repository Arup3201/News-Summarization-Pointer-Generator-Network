When Erin McNeill returned from a gig in 2009 she fell asleep oblivious to the fire that was about to rip through her home in a manner of minutes.

The attractive young singer woke up in hospital six weeks later having suffered third-degree burns only to be told that she had 'died' five times on the operating table.

Erin was forced to learn how to walk again, bend her limbs and eat but sadly her singing voice was damaged beyond repair.

Despite the 21-year-old's inspirational show of bravery she still became the target of Facebook trolls who created a page about her saying she was disgusting.

Erin, from Alloa, has now decided to fight back by entering an international pageant in an incredible bid to prove that beauty really is more than skin deep.

Already named Miss International Scotland, the 21-year-old will compete against other contestants from around the world at the final in Chicago next month.

'Discrimination is not acceptable,' Erin told the Daily Star.

'I want to show people that it is wrong to judge people on the way they look.

'Maybe in the process I can begin to accept myself again.'

Erin was looking at a bright future before her accident and was on the verge of a record deal when the fire broke out.

Firefighters believe the blaze was started by a pot that was left on the stove. The house was engulfed in minutes with temperatures reaching 600 degrees.

Erin's arms and chest were burned to the bone and the rest of her body left red-raw and blistered.

Doctors even considered amputating her arms but eventually performed pioneering surgery using extracts of shark skin, which tricks the body into growing new skin cells.

After three weeks doctors stapled on healthy skin, like a graft and the new cells helped her arms to heal and stop leaking fluid.

But the accident still left her with an apron of loose skin around her belly and she was forced to endure the discomfort of further surgery to remove it.

Erin now volunteers with the fire service and has a boyfriend, Grant, whose dad is also in the fire service.
