Tributes have been paid to a 14-year-old girl whose body was found in woodland yesterday, the day after she disappeared from her family home.

A huge police hunt was launched when Molly O'Donovan vanished from her home in Banbury, Oxfordshire, on Monday morning.

Her body was found by a passerby near Foscote Rise at 11.40am yesterday, according to Thames Valley Police.

Her death is not being treated as suspicious.

Molly was last seen alive at around 9am on Monday and her worried family had told police that her disappearance was completely out of character.

Members of the public rallied around to try and find the missing youngster and handed out hundreds of leaflets and posters.

However, yesterday afternoon police confirmed that her body had been found in woodland not far from her home in the Cherwell Heights area of the town.

'The death is not believed to be suspicious at this stage and inquiries remain ongoing.'
