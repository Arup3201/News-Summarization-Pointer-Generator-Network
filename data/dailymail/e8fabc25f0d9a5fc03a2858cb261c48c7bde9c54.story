A witness was able to videotape a violent attack against a park ranger by a skateboarder in a Philadelphia park on Friday.

Police are investigating the violent encounter that occurred in LOVE Park at around 5 p.m.

Mariano Verrico of Essex Fells, New Jersey managed to capture the horrific event 'over a no skateboard rule' on film.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Hands up: The witness said the park ranger merely lifted his hands in self defense after the skateboarder threatened him with violence

Pushed: The skateboarder aggressively wrestles the park ranger to the ground

'He got kicked in the head repeatedly and spit on,' Verrico told NBC.

'When he was down towards the end..., the one kid who did everything leaned down and spit on him. It was really disgraceful.'

Mariano was visiting Philadelphia for the day with his cousins when he overheard a park ranger telling some men that they had to stop skateboarding in the park because there were too many young children.

'Basically he was just doing his job,' Verrico said.

'His voice wasn't raised. He wasn't cursing.'

Verrico said that the park ranger was merely acting in self defense against the man and while he kept his arms in the air, he never once hit the skateboarder.Â 

Using force: The skateboarder kicks the park ranger several times in the neck and shoulder

Not over yet: The skateboarder gives the park ranger a hard kick to the head

'He never once tried to fight with the kid,' he said.

'He never threw any type of punch at the kid or said anything negative.'

The skateboarder threw a punch at the ranger who fell down onto his back.

The skateboarder then proceeds to kick the park ranger several times in the leg and then in the head.

As though kicking the ranger weren't disrespectful enough, the skateboarder finishes off the ranger by spitting on him.

Once the shameful beating was over, Verrico escorted the park ranger to a Philadelphia Police station to show the video to the police.

Police were unaware of the incident and are now attempting to find the suspect.

Even though skateboarding is banned in LOVE Park, staff are working on including a legal skate spot as they plan a redesign for the popular Philadelphia destination.
