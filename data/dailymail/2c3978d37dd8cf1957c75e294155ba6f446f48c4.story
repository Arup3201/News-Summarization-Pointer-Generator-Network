They go to drink cheap beer and have a good time but a new BBC documentary has revealed men could come home with more (or less in the case of their finances) than they bargained for after a stag party in Prague.

In Sex, Stags and Prague, which airs on BBC Three this evening, Stacey Dooley visits the Czech capital which has become a 'mecca' for men on the cusp of married life.

It's not a surprise to learn they are 
lured by the cut price alcohol and the prevalence of strip clubs 
- where they can get a lap dance for £35 and pay for extras.

Eye-opener: Stacey Dooley visited Prague to discover what really happens on a man's 'last night of freedom'

Let loose: Stacey found many British men like this group are just after some harmless fun but others get into trouble when they drink too much

But she also wanted to find out 'what 
life is really like for the thousands of girls paid to entertain the 
stags and the authorities trying to keep the stags out of trouble'.

Plus she 'gets the 
low down from those who clean up after them, tracks down the criminals 
who prey on them and find out what really goes on on a man's last night 
of freedom.'

After what she learnt speaking to sex workers, Stacey said many brides-to-be may want to put their foot down if their fiance suggests going to Prague for their stag do.

Making money: When strippers met the presenter they said they didn't feel exploited

Prostitution is legal in the city but running a brothel is not. However, Stacey discovered many establishments get around this by thinly disguised them as strip clubs and massage parlours.

One sex worker told Stacey that in her experience, five out of ten men on stag do will sleep with a prostitute - and one of the five will 'always' be the stag.

But what really alarmed Stacey was the number who demand unprotected sex despite the risk of catching an STD.

'If the girl tell him she is HIV 
positive, he still wants sex without condom. They have no brain. It's like 
bungee jumping, it's a thrill, will I or won't I catch it'

One prostitute said a third of her clients ask for unprotected sex - and will offer to pay extra for it.

To support the sex workers and ensure they are safer, Hana Malinova set up the organisation - Bliss Without Risks - in Prague. She visits prositiutes in an amulance to test them for HIV and other STDs.

She said 'a lot' of men will try to convince a woman to have sex without a condom.

'If the girl tell him she is HIV 
positive, he still wants sex without condom. They have no brain. It's like 
bungee jumping, it's a thrill, will I or won't I catch it,' she said.

In danger: Stacey was shown footage of one drunk who climbed a statute in Wenceslas Square and then fell off - resulting in a serious injury

Stacey said: 'I'd be devastated 
if my boyfriend came to Prague with the boys and got carried away and 
had unprotected sex with a prostitute and then had sex with me and gave 
me an STD. It's not a joke.'

But it's not just through sexual indulgence that men are putting themselves at risk when partying in Prague.

The copious amounts of alcohol they drink inevitably leads to trouble.

Stacey visited the police who monitor the city and regularly encounter men falling over and injurying themselves after having one too many.

They showed her footage of one drunken man who had climbed a 15m high statue in Wenceslas Square and then fell off - resulting in a serious injury.

'The locals hate seeing people peeing, puking and being undressed on the street. But they do spend money and 
the economy needs it'

Their inebriated state also makes them easy targets for thieves. Convicted pickpockets admitted to Stacey that they could make thousands of pounds a night by taking wallets from the back pockets of oblivious tourists.

Some prostitutes also admitted that they would gain extra payment by stealling from their clients. Other women stole by offering to have sex, then drugging men and taking their money.

Some stags admitted to Stacey that they felt uncomfortable with the pressure to take drugs whilst in the city. And those who succumbed might not even get drugs at all.

Con artists fooled tourists to part with their cash by selling them 'drugs' which could actually be pine cones. The police said they are often powerless to act because men are too embarrassed to report such crimes, or are too drunk to realise they have been the victim of a theft or con before it's too late - so there's no proof.

Stacey found the drinking culture of Brits abroad can also cause havoc for the locals. One hotel said they will make stag parties leave a deposit because the rooms are often wrecked - usually by groups of British men.

Good for the economy: The average stag spends £500 while in Prague

The manageress explained: 'About three weeks ago we had a 
British stag group that got so pissed they kicked the door and wrecked 
the whole frame. British stags are the worst.'

But she added that many locals simply put up with it because they know it's good for business - on average each stag can spend £500 during their time in Prague.

'They know they (the stags) bring money and tourism is 
important. But on the other hand they hate seeing people peeing and 
puking and being undressed on the street. But they do spend money and 
the economy needs it,' the hotel manager said.

A stripper revealed the 'worse part about the job is when a group is really drunk and doesn't know how to behave'. But Stacey said many of the strippers don't feel explioted because 'they say they have the upper hand, they are earning five times more than they would doing a regular job.'

After her eye-opening weekend, Stacey admitted men should be careful when letting lose on their stag dos.

'Some are having harmless 
fun but there's another side that I massively underestimated - the 
amount of brothels and prosititutes, the pick pocketing and the drugs,' she said.
