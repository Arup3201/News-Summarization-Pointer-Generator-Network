Jeff and his fiancée Stephanie proved that all one needs to have a Hollywood engagement is a camera, a knowledge of photoshop, and some creativity.

Jeff photoshopped he and his fiancée Stephanie into scenes from movies like, 'Star Wars,' 'Titanic,''The Shining,' and 'Wayne's World,' just to name a few.

'F*** it. I'm getting married on Saturday. Here are my crappy engagement photos,' said Jeff when he posted his photos to Reddit under the name 'hamburgerandsandwhiches' on Wednesday.

He wrote in the description, 'I know 
some of these suck, but I don't care. I'm getting married and you can 
eat me. (Please like them!)'

After
just one day, the posting received a whopping 101,181 views. Many 
Reddit users showed admiration for the couple's cinematic fun and Jeff 
happily responded to user comments.

'Will I ever find a love who will let me do some cruddy photoshopping?' asked Sticky_Z. 

Jeff grub responded, 'I did, man. They're out there!'

'Congratulations! I like how you take turns being Han Solo. :),' said giant_squid.

Jeff responded, ' I should have taken a turn as Princess Leia.

The couple will be married on Saturday at Amelita Mirolo Barn in Columbus, Ohio.
