This is certainly not something you see every day.

A baseball fan dressed in a green Morph suit ran onto the pitch during a game in Madison, Wisconsin, and managed to wrestle, sprint and slide his way to escape from SIX security men in pursuit.

He made his exit via a large door at the back of the field - which was being held open by a yellow Morph man, who promptly shut it in the faces of the onrushing staff.

Scroll down for video...

Arms flailing: Dressed head to toe in green, the Morph man comes onto the pitch from the Duck Blind stand of the stadium

A video of the comical incident has attracted nearly 100,000 hits since it was put on YouTube a week ago, with one user commenting: 'hahah this was awesome, what an escape assisted by the yellow man.'

It came at the top of the fifth innings of a match between Madison Mallards and Battle Creek Bombers, two collegiate summer baseball teams.

First, the fan takes everyone by surprise by leaping from the stands and running across the field arms flailing.

First obstacle: The Morph man comes up against two security men and decides to dart to the left

Floored: An older member of staff hauls the Morph man to the ground - but he rolls over and gets out of his grasp

Then, he charges towards staff when they come to stop him and it looks like his fun is over as he is wrestled to the ground.

But despite four officials surrounding the masked man, he manages to push one away and makes a dash for the far fence.

One shove and away: The lycra-clad individual pushes a staff member and makes a dart for the back of the field

Out-paced: The ground's security staff fail to keep up with the anonymous prankster

Slippery: One security man goes for a slide tackle in the wet conditions but fails to grab Morph man's heels

As he sprints away, attempts at slide tackles are poorly timed and even a sixth security man can't keep pace with the prankster.

But with seemingly nowhere to go, his chances of escape don't look good.

That is until a large door at the back of the field, used for bringing in batting cages, is opened by his accomplice dressed in a yellow Morph man costume.

To the rescue: The green Morph man has help in the shape of a yellow Morph man, who holds open the door used to bring batting cages onto the field

Slammed shut: The yellow Morph man completes the stunt by locking in the staffers

They exchange a high five as the green Morph man runs out and the stunt is complete when the door, which locks from the outside, is slammed shut in the staff members' faces.

Another YouTube user posted: 'I watched this from the duck blind (the stadium's main stand) and couldn't stop laughing!'

Mallards president Vern Stenman told MailOnline he had never seen anything like it before and said he thought is could be an former employee with knowledge of how the door works.

Mr Stenman said: 'Our staff are kind of perplexed. We're used to having people on the field but usually they are drunk so easy to handle.'

There was a similar stunt days later when the green man escaped by climbing up a rope ladder dropped down over the far wall by his yellow accomplice.
