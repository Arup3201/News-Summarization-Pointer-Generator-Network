Police have called on the help of psychics to help find a mute autistic boy who has been missing for a week.

Avonte Oquendo, 14, went missing from the Center Boulevard School in Long Island City in the Queens borough of New York City last Friday.

According to reports, more than one clairvoyant is working to find the teen, who has a mental age of about seven and can't verbally communicate.

Missing: Avonte Oquendo was last seen on a school surveillance video leaving the Center Boulevard School in Long Island City, Queens around 12:45pm last Friday

'All leads are investigated when it involves missing children and some of those leads come from speaking to psychics,' a source told the New York Daily News.

One psychic tip sent police to a subway tunnel near Tompkins Square Park, but they found no sign of Avonte Oquendo.

Hope: The Oquendo family are still hopeful that the missing teen will show up

Police are paying special attention to trains, subway tunnels and train yards, because the non-verbal teen has a fascination with railways.

The Oquendo family is furious that the boy was allowed to leave the school by himself.

Surveillance footage taken at 12:40pm last Friday shows Avonte Oquendo running through the school corridors towards the doors.

More footage outside the school shows him walking away by himself.

The Oquendos have filed a claim to sue the city and the school district for failing to supervise Avonte.

'We only get a few hours of sleep 
every day, our mom can't stop crying, we can't eat,' Danny Oquendo, 
Avonte's older brother, told HuffPost.

The teen’s mother Vanessa Fontaine spoke about her hopes for her son yesterday to NBC.

'I’m
just hoping he’s okay. He finds some shelter from the rain. He’s not 
sick. He’s not passed out from not eating. It’s been days and days and 
days,' Fontaine said.

She said she can't watch the security footage of her son leaving the school.

'I can’t watch it. I can’t see him run off like that and nobody’s running behind him to say, "Hey kid, come back here." There’s no one,' Fontaine said.According to the boy's grandmother Doris McCoy, a security guard questioned Avonte about where he was going as he made his way out of the school on Friday.

Escape: Once he got outside, Avonte Oquendo ran down the street out of sight and hasn't been seen since

When he didn't respond, she allowed him to leave without any further inquiry.

The family's attorney, David Perecman also said it took the school too long to notify the boy’s mother about his disappearance.

'The school had ordered a lockdown and was looking for the child in the school for an hour before they even let mom know,' he said.

Perecman told the New York Daily News that the teen may have been able to slip out of school while 'a fight in the cafeteria distracted adults supervising him.'

Clues: Police have followed up many leads, including a psychic's tip about Tompkins Square Park, but none have turned up any sign of the mute teen yet

Thanks to an anonymous donation, autism advocacy organization Autism Speaks is now offering a $50,000 reward for information that leads to Avonte being found.

A candlelit vigil will be held Friday night outside of Avonte Oquendo's Long Island City school.

Avonte Oquendo is described as being five-feet three-inches tall and weighing 125lb with short black hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing a gray striped shirt, black jeans, and black sneakers.
