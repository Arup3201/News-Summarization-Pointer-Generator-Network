With just six days to go until the launch of the London Olympics most of us are still none the wiser about what the spectacular opening ceremony will consist of.

But a new 17 second-long video clip on You Tube has nevertheless given a tantalising glimpse of some of the ten thousand volunteers being put through their paces - from a group of dancers practicing their moves to an orchestra rehearsing.

The video, released by the organisers, shows a variety of intriguing scenes in quick succession, including what looks like molten metal being poured from a kiln, to a canon being fired and part of a spectacular fireworks display.

In other scenes a woman is seen being lowered by a chord wearing a crash helmet, young ballet dancers practice their steps and BMX riders test their skills on a cycle ramp.

Preparations for the three-hour opening ceremony are in full swing, with the 10,000 volunteer performers
now attending thrice-weekly rehearsals. If any of them miss a single 
rehearsal, they are told not to come back.

Danny
Boyle, who directed Slumdog Millionaire, is in creative charge, and as recent  pictures of the scenes inside the stadium reveal, the show will 
essentially tell the story of the making of Britain — culturally, 
socially and politically.

Coordinating the thousands of volunteers taking part has been a mammoth task

Organisers
have flouted the usual 7.30pm start because they require dark for 
fireworks. The finish is expected to be after midnight.

The artistic part of the opening ceremony has had to be cut short by 30 minutes to ensure that spectators leave on time.

At
least 100 Team GB competitors won’t march in the parade because they’ll
be competing next morning.

And the 75-strong track and field team, 
including Jessica Ennis, Mo Farah and Dai Greene, will be in Portugal at
a preparation camp, as their events start in the second week of the 
Games.

Olympic cheerleaders have also been practicing their dance routines - pictured here at the beach volleyball training courts at Horseguards Parade in central London

The
main stadium will be transformed into a meadow, with real grass laid 
over the infield and a game of cricket unfolding in one corner.

At one 
end there will be a replica of Glastonbury Tor, the ancient site in 
Somerset which is linked to Arthurian legend.

In
front of the Tor will be a mosh-pit, to replicate the dance area in 
front of the stage at the Glastonbury Festival. Here, up to 100 members 
of the public who have bought tickets will be allowed to stand.

At the other end of the stadium, 
beneath a giant bell, will be the ‘posh-pit’ — so named by Danny Boyle 
because the public there will be reflecting the spirit of promenaders at
Last Night of the Proms.

There will also be four giant Maypoles representing England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland.

The
green will give way to an industrial landscape with models of The 
Gherkin, the Houses of Parliament and the Royal Albert Hall which have 
been built at a site in Dagenham.

Performers will recreate the Jarrow 
march of 1936, when 200 men walked to London to protest about 
unemployment and poverty in the North-East.

The
NHS will be honoured by real nurses pushing hospital beds around the 
arena, and there will also be a tribute to the suffragette movement.

Performers will also pay homage to The Beatles.
