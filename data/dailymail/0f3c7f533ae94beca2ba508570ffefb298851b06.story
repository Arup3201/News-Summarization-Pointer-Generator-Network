Some 650,000 people said they wanted Meriam Ibrahim to be freed from her cell where she is eight months pregnant and in shackles with her toddler son Martin next to her.

The 27-year-old’s ‘crime’ was to marry a Christian because her father was a Muslim and a judge said she should be worshipping Islam.

Meriam Ibrahim, 27, was convicted by a Khartoum court this week of apostasy, or the renunciation of faith, and sentenced to death. Ibrahim is Christian, her husband said. But the court considers her to be Muslim

Yet in a statement the Sudanese embassy to the US sided with the court and claimed that she was lying about her family raising her as a Christian.

In a stinging rebuke, it claimed that it was ‘unwise and dangerous’ to protest about Meriam’s treatment even though it is a breach of Sudan’s constitution.

Meriam has been locked up in a notorious women’s prison in Khartoum since September after being charged with adultery and apostasy and given the death sentence.

She was also sentenced to 100 lashes as the Sudanese court refused to recognize her 2011 marriage to husband Daniel, a naturalized US citizen from Manchester, New Hampshire.

The judge in the case said that because she was born a Muslim she should stay a Muslim.

The case has attracted international outrage and the governments of the UK, the US and the Netherlands have all spoken of their concern.

But now, as Meriam’s lawyers file an appeal to get her off death row, Amnesty has revealed that its petition to have Meriam released has reached 650,000 signatures.

A petition sponsored by Amnesty International has garnered more than 650,000 signatures demanding the release of Meriam Ibrahim (right), pictured here with her husband Daniel.

Manar Idriss, Amnesty International's Sudan researcher, said: ‘The plight and the bravery of this young pregnant mother has clearly touched the world.

‘More than 650,000 Amnesty International supporters have taken action to call for her immediate and unconditional release.

‘Since Meriam has been sentenced, we are deeply concerned at the conditions of her detention and use of cruel and inhuman forms of restraint.

‘We have received worrying reports that she has been constantly shackled. The Sudanese authorities must guarantee Meriam's safety and release her immediately and unconditionally.’

Such calls appear to have fallen on deaf ears with the Sudanese embassy to the US, however.

Its statement it claimed that Meriam’s case was merely a ‘legal issue and not a religious or a political one.'

It expressed ‘regret’ at reports of her fate and hit out at those who have ‘mistakenly accused the government of Sudan of violating human rights’.

The statement said: ‘The official records of the Government of Sudan indicates that the real name of the lady mentioned in this case as Mariam Ibrahim is actually 'Abrar Elhadi Muhammad Abdallah Abugadeen' and there is no official record shows that her name was changed to Mariam Ibrahim Yahia.

‘Abrar was born in um Shagrah in Algadarif state on Jan. Ist. 1986 to Muslim Sudanese parents and the claim that the mother is an Orthodox Christian from Ethiopia is untrue.’

The statement added that ‘freedom of choice is the cornerstone of both Islam and Christianity’, even though Meriam has effectively been told by a court which religion she must worship.

Pressure to help Meriam has also come from two senators who have sent the Secretary of State a second letter demanding that more be done to help Meriam.

New Hampshire's Senator Kelly Ayotte and fellow Republican Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri have said they are concerned that the government is wasting time.

Earlier this week MailOnline revealed that it was allegedly jealousy and greed which drove Meriam Ibrahim’s own family to file lawsuit against her alleging apostasy and adultery which led to the criminal charges being filed.

Her half brother and half sister - who had not seen her for decades - tracked her down so they could get rid of her and take over her successful general store, Meriam’s lawyers alleged.

Daniel has only been allowed into the prison once to see his son Martin, 20 months, in what was an emotional reunion.
