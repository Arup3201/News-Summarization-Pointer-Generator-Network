It certainly is an unusual way to get one of your five-a-day.

In what looks like something out of TV chef Heston Blumenthal's kitchen, a London-based caterer has transformed asparagus into a powder which is  snorted by diners rather than being eaten.

Bubble Foods used molecular gastronomy, which Blumenthal pioneered, to create the unusual dish, which they say provides a 'unique sensory experience'.

Party powder: The powdery asparagus is meant to 'wow' diners

Diners sniff the powder, which smells the same as asparagus, notorious for making urine smell.

But already drug campaigners have condemned the move, branding the unusual presentation of the green stuff as 'provocative' and glamorising drugs.

But the caterers insist it is a 'tongue in cheek' move, and meant to be an innovative way of 'producing playful and exciting culinary and sensory experiences'.

No need for knives and forks: A chef carefully lines up the asparagus powder for dinner guests

The company says on its website that their head chef Alejandro Diaz is in charge of the metamorphosis.

His menus 'transform the physical and chemical elements of ingredients beyond their original state' to bring the 'wow factor' to any dinner.

No more solids: The vegetable goes through many processes before it is turned into a fine powder

Company boss Michael Collins told the Metro: 'We've started to do molecular gastronomy to make events more fun and interactive.

'It's about deconstructing and reconstructing food to stimulate all the different sense: smell, taste and vision.'

But drugs campaigner Lucy Dawe, from Cannabis Skunk Sense,  branded the novelty as 'provocative and deeply irresponsible'.

'Personally, I think it's very irresponsible. People might think it's a huge joke but to me it's a very dangerous precedent to set.

'It's extremely provocative, I can see no reason to turn this into 
something you can sniff - I'm sure there's lots of other ways they could
have turned it into something you can eat.

'It does risk bring more and more people into contact with drugs, a world where there's nothing but misery waiting for them.'

Aside from transforming the vegetable the company can also whip up a quail trifle, encapsulated smoked duck salad, beetroot air and a corn and coconut pillow.
