Everton are unbeaten in their past five matches against Arsenal — the longest undefeated spell in 110 years of playing the Gunners. 

He did what all top strikers should. With time ticking away and a crucial match on the brink of being lost, Olivier Giroud saved the day.

Getting his head to a cross from Nacho Monreal and diverting it beyond Tim Howard as a pulsating game entered its 90th minute, Giroud sped away after rescuing a point, sliding on his knees into the corner of Goodison Park where Arsenal’s supporters celebrated.

Giroud was crucial in turning the tide. His fizzing volley, which sped over Howard’s bar, gave Arsenal a jolt of confidence a minute after he replaced the ineffectual Alexis Sanchez; he provided his team with belief, a presence and, ultimately, a reward for their laboured efforts.

That’s what all the top front men do and, for 45 minutes, that’s how Giroud — who left with his left foot in a protective boot — performed. But . . .

There has to be a ‘but’. Giroud may have scored 16 times in the last Barclays Premier League campaign and won the FA Cup but many, notably Gary Lineker, have questioned if the France striker will ever be the 25-goal man to take Arsenal up a level.

‘How sure are you he won’t be that man?’ asked Wenger, who is likely to be without Giroud against Besiktas on Wednesday. ‘What he demonstrated when he came on was convincing.

‘Olivier is improving every year. I wouldn’t rule out he will get 25 goals. All our opponents have been looking for strikers as well and nobody has found a world-class one available better than the one they have.’

There was more support for Giroud from Aaron Ramsey, whose 83rd- minute goal gave Arsenal a lifeline. ‘I like playing with him because I can run off him and he can play me in,’ said Ramsey. ‘He got a load of goals for us last season, he was our top scorer. He is very valuable to this team.’

Many Arsenal fans were excited to see Alexis Sanchez get the nod as the lone centre forward against Everton, but Chile’s World Cup star struggled to impose himself against Everton centre halves Phil Jagielka and Sylvain Distin.

Before his half-time substitution, Sanchez managed just 26 touches — none of which were in Everton’s penalty area. 

It was down to much-maligned striker Olivier Giroud to bring Arsenal’s attack more purpose.

Yet does Wenger still need another forward before the window closes? In the opening half, when Sanchez looked woefully off the pace, you would have said yes. Wenger, though, is unmoved and says he never considered entering the bidding for Liverpool-bound Mario Balotelli.

‘We have (Yaya) Sanogo, who will be important,’ added Wenger. ‘We have Giroud, Joel Campbell can play centre forward, and of course Sanchez, and Theo Walcott coming back. 

'You don’t put a pot of players together and bring in people just to have them there. The transition was better in the second half when we had the ball.’

It is to Arsenal’s credit they hauled themselves off the floor, having been run ragged for 45 minutes, as goals from Seamus Coleman and Steven Naismith threatened to see Everton repeat the 3-0 savaging they inflicted in April. 

They would have seen the game out had they taken a couple of chances in the second period. That explains why Roberto Martinez is looking for another striker before the window closes, with Samuel Eto’o and Danny Welbeck contenders.

‘There is a lot of money involved in those two (deals),’ said the Everton manager. ‘I am looking at all options. Our first half shows what we have got in the squad. It is about how we are going to do that over 90 minutes.’
