This beautiful house has a claim to be the most tranquil home in the world - but this amount of relaxation comes with a hefty price tag.

The mansion on the shore of Lake Geneva has gone up for sale for £50million, and has rapidly become one of the hottest properties currently on the market.

Whichever stressed-out millionaire eventually snaps up the house will get a private swimming pool, Turkish baths, sauna, spa, massage room - and a living room with an unbeatable view over the lake.

Peaceful: This house in a star-studded neighbourhood on the shore of Lake Geneva has gone up for sale for £50million

View: The mansion looks out over Lake Geneva, giving its new owner a spectacular landscape

Lake: The property has a path from the house down to a private dock for boating on Lake Geneva

They will also have the chance to hang out with stars in the Swiss town of Genthod, where their neighbours will include Michael Schumacher and Phil Collins.

A spokesman for Sotheby's International, which is listing the property, said: 'This is one of the most impressive properties currently for sale.

'It is bold, original and provides some of the most breath-taking views you could imagine - waking up to Lake Geneva is enough to completely relax anyone.

'There are a number of well-known residents who already choose to settle with their families on the lake and this is certainly a property that has attracted a similar calibre of interest. This is a sublime property beyond compare.'

Terrace: The millionaire buyer will be able to sit outside the house every evening and enjoy the sunset

Modern: The building's sleek interiors are designed to appeal to the new breed of international super-rich

Trendy: A spiral staircase curves around a glass lift shaft giving residents options over how to get around the house

The four-storey house, designed by South African firm SAOTA, is spread over 14,000 sq. ft - including a fully equipped basement with generous picture windows largely opening out to the exterior.

From the spacious ground floor hall doors open into a huge living room with high ceilings, large dining area, a fully fitted kitchen with state-of-the-art equipment and a family room.

Each floor is serviced by a glass elevator, opening into a mezzanine that overlooks the ground floor living room.

Open: The house is dominated by high ceilings and large windows allowing light to get in

Distraction: The property is equipped with its own boardroom - but with a view over the lake, it may be hard to concentrate on business

Chilling out: The indoor swimming pool, which is accompanied by a sauna and spa, is the perfect way to relax

The long hallway with fitted closets leads to three bedrooms, including a master bedroom, each with their own en suite bathroom, toilet and dressing-room.

The basement has a large car showroom, a garage, a conference room, a study and every spa treatment facility possible.

At the end of the garden, two annexes provide a studio flat and a 1,506 sq. ft loft with terrace, private court and living space.

Warm glow: This bathroom is kitted out in a yellow colour scheme to make it more welcoming

Huge: The property covers an area of 14,000 sq. ft in total, making enough space for even the largest of families

Popular: The Swiss town of Genthod is already home to wealthy stars such as Phil Collins and Michael Schumacher

There is also a private dock where the future owner can tie up the family speedboat, fishing boat or an array of water-sports vehicles.

Moguls seeking to secure the property will have to move fast, as a number of wealthy house-hunters have already expressed an interest.

Sotheby's said: 'There has been a large amount of interest in the property so far but as of yet no official deal has been agreed.'
