Radical action: Deputy governor of the Bank of England Paul Tucker said a reduction of the base rate to below zero should be considered

Negative interest rates could become a reality in an ‘extraordinary’ move by the Bank of England to kick-start the economy, one of its senior officials revealed yesterday.

Deputy governor Paul Tucker said a reduction of the base rate to below zero should be considered four years after it was cut to a record low of 0.5 per cent.

But the very suggestion that million of savers should suffer fresh hits to their hard earned nest eggs caused outrage last night. Critics said prudent savers and pensioners have been punished enough by rates kept deliberately low to help support borrowers and the wider economy.

If the base rate did become negative, it would mean major banks would have to pay the Bank of England to hold their money. The idea is that this would encourage them to lend more to stimulate both business and house buying. 

But already low saving accounts rates would be slashed to virtually zero – meaning their value would be outstripped by the rate of inflation.

Mr Tucker also said the Bank stood ready to turn on the printing presses for a fourth time and add to the £375billion of emergency funds it has already pumped into the economy through three rounds of quantitative easing.

A sub zero rate could also drive down the cost of mortgages for millions of borrowers – although it is highly unlikely that mortgage rates would also turn negative.

Mr Tucker insisted that such ‘radical’ action must be ‘thought through carefully’ by the rate-setting monetary policy committee. But it is thought senior executives at the Bank are keen to show they have not run out of ideas of how to stimulate the sickly economy. ‘We are not stuck in the mud,’ said a well-placed source.

Mr Tucker raised the prospect of negative interest rates to MPs on the Treasury Select Committee in the wake of the loss of Britain’s gold-plated AAA credit rating.

The economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2012 – rounding off the worst four-year period outside the aftermath of war for more than 100 years. 

Chancellor George Osborne is under mounting pressure to breathe life into the economy in next month’s Budget to avoid a triple-dip recession. But the Bank is also facing calls to do more to support the recovery.

Negative interest rates would mean the central bank charges banks to hold their money and could encourage them to lend more to households and businesses instead.

It would also lower interest rates banks pay out to savers as well as borrowing costs for households and businesses, potentially encouraging households to spend.

The Bank has so far shied away from taking such action due to the damage it could do to UK building societies, which rely heavily on attracting deposits from savers.

But Mr Tucker told MPs: ‘I hope that we will think about the constraints of setting negative interest rates. This would be an extraordinary thing to do and it needs to be thought through carefully.’ 

Simon Rose, from campaign group Save Our Savers, said he was ‘flabbergasted’ by Mr Tucker’s suggestion, adding: ‘This would be disastrous not only for savers but for the UK economy.’ Inflation has been above the 2 per cent target since late 2009 and the Bank this month said it expected it to stay there until 2016 – eating into workers’ pay and savers’ nest eggs.

A cut in interest rates would benefit borrowers, particularly those on tracker mortgages. The cheapest tracker available at the moment is from ING Direct and charges Bank rate plus 1.44 per cent for two years – or 1.94 per cent today.

It is improbable the Bank would cut rates so far into negative territory to make even the cheapest of mortgages fall below zero. A rate of between minus 0.25 per cent and minus 0.5 per cent is seen as the limit because beyond this it would be cheaper for banks to store their money in cash rather than at the central bank – rendering the official Bank rate all but useless.

Analysis by Alex Brummer

Paul Tucker may have missed out on the top job at the Bank of England but he is clearly determined to show he has plenty of ideas to kick-start the lagging British economy.

Amid an array of new tools mentioned by the deputy governor of the Bank of England is a possible experiment with negative interest rates that caught the eye.

Such a radical policy would be to discourage banks from holding on to spare cash thereby forcing them to lend. But by penalising people with savings it might encourage them to consume more rather than hold cash on deposit.

Tucker is concerned that despite all the
 efforts by the authorities to get banks to lend to small and medium 
sized enterprises the flow of cash has not been strong enough to 
encourage entrepreneurship and growth.

Negative interest rates, that have been tried in the past by Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland and Japan, effectively act as a tax on the banks keeping large deposits with the Bank of England. With the onset of the financial crisis more than five years ago and the deepening of the problems in the eurozone UK banks have become more distrustful of lending funds to other banks and many have been holding larger than usual balances with the Bank of England.

Negative rates would, if they worked as 
expected, improve the flow of lending and lower the cost of business 
loans. However, it would not make the Bank any more popular among savers
 who have seen returns decimated in recent times.

The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street has held the base rate at 0.5 per cent for four years. But that is still higher than the US central bank the Federal Reserve that has been targeting interest rates at between zero and 0.25 per cent.

Savings rates at the commercial banks and building societies already sit at record lows and are effectively in negative territory already because of the pernicious effect of inflation.

With consumer prices currently rising at 2.7 per cent, savers need returns higher than that to be in positive territory. Tucker also signalled the Bank is looking at other methods of improving the finances of struggling smaller business. An expansion of the £80billion Funding for Lending scheme that has helped restart the housing market is one possibility.

An immediate consequence of a decision to introduce negative interest rates would be to exert downward pressure on the pound on foreign exchange markets. In much the same as it would discourage UK high street banks to hang onto to surplus cash it would also discourage investors from overseas keeping their surpluses with British banks.

Indeed, Tucker’s comments caused a brief wobble in the pound on the foreign exchange markets in latest trading. This despite the fact negative rates are just an idea that given the harsh impact on ordinary depositors will struggle to find political support.
