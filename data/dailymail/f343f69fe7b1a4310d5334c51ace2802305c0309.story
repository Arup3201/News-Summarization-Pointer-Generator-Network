Anton Ferdinand was today spared having to shake John Terry's hand before QPR's FA Cup clash with Chelsea.

The Football Association gave the clubs permission not to take part in the traditional pre-match handshake, amid uncertainty as to whether Rangers defender Ferdinand would snub Terry.

Today is the first time the two sides have met since Terry was charged with racially abusing Ferdinand during October`s Premier League game between the two.

Terry has denied the offence and Ferdinand was reportedly agonising over whether or not to accept his hand.

The FA released a statement, which read: 'Following discussions on Friday evening and Saturday morning involving senior officials from QPR, Chelsea and the FA, it has been agreed there will not be the usual team handshake before today's FA Cup fourth-round tie at Loftus Road.

'The FA agreed to the request by both clubs in an attempt to further defuse tensions before the match.'

During today's game Ferdinand's first touch was greeted with huge cheers from the home support but shortly after half time fans were reported to be throwing objects at each other.

Chelsea went ahead in the cup clash around the hour mark as QPR goalkeeper Paddy Kenny was sent the wrong way by a Juan Mata penalty.

The decision to award the spot kick came after Daniel Sturridge went down in the box, following a tackle from Clint Hill.

That spot kick settled the cup tie and Chelsea sailed through to the next round but the cancelled handshake was the real talking point.

It is not the first time John Terry has been at the centre of a handshake row.

Two years ago Manchester City defender Wayne Bridge snubbed Terry's hand as the pair met for the first time since revelations about Terry's alleged affair with Bridge’s ex-partner Vanessa Perroncel.

Yesterday Ferdinand had been the target of a death threat on the eve of his reunion with race-row rival John Terry.

He was sent a bullet in the post just 24 hours before QPR met Chelsea in the FA Cup, according to Sky News.

A
Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘I can confirm we are investigating
an allegation of malicious communication received today at Queens Park 
Rangers football club.

‘Officers from Hammersmith and Fulham are investigating.’

The report is a chilling echo of when
Celtic manager Neil Lennon was mailed a bullet, death threats and 
parcel bombs earlier this year.

The revelation was thought to put 
Ferdinand's planned appearance in the game in jeopardy but the defender 
made the starting line-up.

The QPR defender was allegedly the victim of a racist slur from the England captain during
October's Barclays Premier League game between the sides.

It is the first time since that game, which QPR won 1-0, and just four days 
before the court case begins in which Terry stands accused of abusing 
Ferdinand, that the pair have come up against each other.

Chelsea fans have previously been heard chanting: 'Anton Ferdinand, you know what you are

QPR manager Mark Hughes said: 'I think we understand what is meant by that.

'If there is inappropriate chanting or behaviour then you get ejected from the ground.'

Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas said yesterday he hoped Ferdinand would not snub Terry.

Ferdinand was said to be agonising over 
whether or not to shake Terry's hand before the match but the decision was taken out of his hands.

Asked yesterday if it was important they shook hands, Villas-Boas said: 'Extremely important, extremely important.

'This game is based on good values more than anything else.

'These players should continue to promote these good values.'

Villas-Boas confirmed the matter had been discussed with Terry, who denies having racially abused Ferdinand.

The Chelsea boss said: 'Everybody has been having conversations, from the top, to the players, to the manager.'

Hughes, said: 'If he feels it is not appropriate, that has to 
be his own decision. It won't be influenced by myself or the club.'

Villas-Boas
reiterated he would not consider leaving out Terry and said he had not 
felt the need to check on his frame of mind this week.

'No, not at all,' he said. 'I have to count on the player, and the player is fit and available for the game.

He also revealed he had no plans to 
issue special instructions to his players reminding them to stay calm 
amid what is likely to be a hostile atmosphere.

Admitting there were 'extra 
responsibilities' to consider, he added: 'I won't speak to the players 
specifically about that before the game, not at all.'

'Supporters
from both sides were this week warned about their conduct and 
Villas-Boas predicted there would not be any problems at QPR's Loftus Road ground.

He said: 'The environment was outstanding the last time we played there at Loftus Road, so I expect it to be the same.'

Hughes says QPR are ready to eject anyone making trouble.

'We as a club obviously have spoken quite closely with Chelsea and the police. I just hope everybody is sensible and enjoys the game for what it is, a fantastic cup tie that we're all looking forward to.

'We basically want to be talking about the football and what happens on the pitch.'
