Arsene Wenger defended his decision to field a hugely inexperienced defence as Arsenal crashed out of the Capital One Cup.

Dusan Tadic’s penalty followed by Nathaniel Clyne’s 30-yard thunderbolt secured a deserved victory for Southampton at the Emirates Stadium after Alexis Sanchez’s brilliant free-kick put the Gunners ahead.

Arsenal’s back-four has been ravaged by injury in recent weeks; Mathieu Debuchy and Nacho Monreal were confirmed absentees for Tuesday night’s clash, while Wenger revealed following the defeat that Per Mertesacker (gluteal) and Kieran Gibbs (hamstring) were only fit enough for a place on the bench.

That meant Arsenal fielded a defence consisting of youngsters Hector Bellerin, Calum Chambers, Isaac Hayden and Francis Coquelin - who is a central midfielder by trade.

And Wenger said: ‘We lacked a bit of experience at the back. We gave a lot, and it’s frustrating not to be able to score in the second half.

‘We are a bit short at the back, yes, because of the injuries. You sit there and think: Gibbs had a little hamstring problem and we could not play him, Mertesacker is a bit on the edge, and then we have no choice.

‘I think if we lost the game tonight, it’s not because of Hayden, not because of Chambers and not because of Coquelin. You have to be realistic.

‘It’s disappointing because we had a good start and we made two un-needed errors on the two goals, and big ones.

Nathaniel Clyne fires home the winner for Southampton as they sent Arsenal crashing out 

Clyne celebrates scoring his winner as Southampton continued their impressive early season form 

‘When you look at the amount of possession we had, we have to give credit to Southampton, they played well and were well organised.

‘They abused a bit the fouls in the middle of the park, but they are a good side and they played well.

‘We gave a lot, I cannot fault the spirit, the attitude. The first reason of our defeat is the quality of our opponent and the performance of our opponent.’

Meanwhile, Saints manager Ronald Koeman heaped praise on his side following their win at the Emirates Stadium and insisted there was more to come.

The Dutchman said: ‘Until now we have showed our ambition and level even tonight. I’m proud of them but I realise football can chang fast and we have to continue like this and keep our feet on the ground.

‘I’m a little bit surprised at how well we’ve started the season, because it is always difficult if you have a lot of changes in the team.

‘You need adaptation time with the players who come in but from the first day we worked hard to have good organisation in the and that is important for confidence.’
