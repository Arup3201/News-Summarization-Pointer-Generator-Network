Never-before-seen photographs have emerged showing North Korea leader Kim Jong-un as a young boy - including one of him saluting in military uniform.

The images formed part of a broadcast by the state-run television station of a concert where the dictator met members of the country's air force.

In the footage, a number of pictures from Kim's childhood are displayed on a big screen while a military band plays on stage next to a full-scale air force plane.

Kim Jong Young: Previously unseen pictures have emerged showing the North Korean leader as a toddler - including this one of him saluting in military uniform

Indoctrinated: Kim Jong-un smiles for the camera while wearing an air force uniform aged about five years old

Is he writing his manifesto? Again pictured in a military-style outfit, a young Kim is shown writing or drawing in this picture released by the North Korean Central Television (KCTV)

Two of them show him in military outfits - one smiling for the camera, the other saluting with a focused gaze - in a disturbing reminder of North Korea's determined indoctrination of their youth.

Another shows the leader, possibly as a teenager, behind what appear to be the controls of an aircraft.

Between shots of the images, the camera cuts to rows upon rows of marvelling air force personnel in the audience who robotically clap throughout.

The video later shows a group of girls crying, clapping and waving as he meets members of the air force after the concert.

The North's official news agency KCNA said the concert was held on April 16.

The
 systematic indoctrination of North Korean children starts as early as 
kindergarten, where they learn that their country has had two main 
enemies: the Japanese, who colonised Korea from 1910 to 1945, and the 
U.S., which fought against North Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War.

The
 South Koreans are generally not included in the hate campaign, as they 
are portrayed as American puppets, according to a report from The 
Associated Press two years ago.

The
 military themes reach a peak every year on International Children's Day
 on June 1 when students convene en masse, dressed in uniforms and armed
 with toy rifles and bayonets for huge parades.
