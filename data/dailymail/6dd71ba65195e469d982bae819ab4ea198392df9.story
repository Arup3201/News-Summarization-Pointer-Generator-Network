James Corden is in serious danger of becoming the second most famous celebrity West Ham fan in the USA. Surpassing frequent visitor, and thorn in their side, Russell Brand, but failing to crack the number one slot, currently held by the President of their country. So fair enough, I suppose.

Corden has pulled off an amazing coup and joined the ranks of US Talk Show hosts. In the recent game of musical frontman chairs, Craig Ferguson gave up his on The Late Late Show, and young James is now set to nestle his rear into place instead. There’s no doubt his celebrated stint on Broadway in ‘One Man, Two Guv’nors’ helped his cause. But it is surely his work from behind a desk at Sky One that has really sealed the deal.

A League Of Their Own is currently in its eighth series, and a jewel in the channel’s crown. What’s more, it has gone through a few changes over the years, but now really seems to have hit pay dirt with its team spirit, wacky antics (and less pre-recorded set pieces), and general sense of joie de vivre. Which when you read it, sounds like it might actually be pretty annoying. But in practice, is genuinely a good, knockabout hour of fun. With some sport attached!

One thing that certainly gets the telly magic happening is quite how much Corden clearly enjoys the company of his two team captains - Freddie Flintoff, and our very own Jamie Redknapp. Freddie, of course, has Jack Whitehall alongside him. Which you’d think would be completely chalk and cheese as a partnership. But actually works more like cheese and onion. And in the green packet. Like it should be.

And where these two happily gad about and take it over-the-top, Jamie’s is a more subtle impact. But nonetheless effective for it. First of all, he’s charm itself. When James asked him what he did to prepare for a new series, he drolly replied ‘I do a few comedy clubs’. Young Redknapp may not go in for the thigh slappers, but he’s got a great little comic touch on him.

Then he is also clearly popular with co-stars. This manifested itself perfectly on one of the physical rounds, when he and Freddie went head to head in a game of Wasabi Russian Roulette. Or as Jamie decided to play it, spitting sushi into a bucket. In amongst the massive mouthfuls and looks of genuine disgust, our man could be heard continually muttering what could be his new, well, FIRST catchphrase - ‘I don’t like it’.

Redknapp and Keegan give it some welly as they thrust Howard towards the foam bowling pins 

Corden, cracking up, said he sounded like his 3 year old son ‘at every meal time’. And I can’t wait to hear him punditing on his next live Sky match when David Jones asks him what he thinks of the game. Please Jamie, tell him ‘I don’t like it’.

However, the gracious fella that he is, I’m sure he’d agree he wasn’t the star of this particular show. That title surely belonged to the sporting legend for this episode, Kevin Keegan. A League Of Their Own is never short of big names willing to muck in, and be at the butt end of the jokes in the process. But the little grey-haired fella in the nice crew neck jumper did what he often used to on the pitch, and turned the tables in his favour.

The great Fergie rant was shown right at the start of the show. And James exercised his mad DJ skillz playing ‘samples’ of it throughout. The Keegan barnets from across the years were also subject to great scrutiny. As was most of the rest of him in an old photo on the beach, in the flimsiest pair of official England issue trunks.

Keegan sang his heart out, much to the enjoyment of team captains Redknapp and Howard

Which got a good laugh. But when Kevin explained that if you’d trained as hard as they’d made at his club in Germany, Hamburg, ‘you would have a physique like that’. Before turning to James and saying, ‘well, you wouldn’t!’.

So happy were Freddie and Jack with this, they had to run across the studio to high five him!

But that wasn’t the best of it. Always finish on a song is a good old showbiz adage. And it was Kevin Keegan’s hit from the late Seventies that ultimately brought the house down. An old clip of him performing ‘Head Over Heels’ on a telly show certainly got the audience going. But once Jamie decided to recreate the moment we’d just seen, and had Keegan sing while sitting on his knee, it got positively anthemic. The panelists were up. The crowd was up. Arms were raised overhead, and clapping along occurred as Kevin went for it, a capella.

It was a fantastic, spontaneous moment and the kind of thing that has kept this series fresh across the years. James Corden may indeed have a great career as a US talk show host, but he might never have quite as much fun. To paraphrase Jamie, ‘I like it’.
