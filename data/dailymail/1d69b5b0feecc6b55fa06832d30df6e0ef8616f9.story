Isidro Miguel Delacruz, who faces a capital murder charge after being accused of slitting the throat of his ex-girlfriend's five-year-old daughter

The former stepfather of a five-year-old girl who allegedly slit her throat after he split with her mother could face the death penalty. 

Isidro Miguel Delacruz Junior of San Angelo, Texas faces a capital murder charge after being accused of breaking into his ex-girlfriend's home and fatally stabbing Naiya Villegas earlier this week.

San Angelo police said that they were called to the home early on Tuesday when they responded to two 911 calls regarding alleged domestic violence at a house.

Officers discovered the injured child, Naiya Villegas, and two more female victims, the 33-year-old mother Tanya Bermea, and her 62-year-old mother, Jesusita.

All three were taken to hospital where the little girl died. The mother and grandmother had non-life threatening injuries.

As the child victim was under-10, he could face the death penalty, although it has been reported no decision has yet been taken on this. 

According to a police report, Delacruz was seen holding paper towels to the girl's throat after she was stabbed.

It is also said that he punched Miss Bermea several times, pushed her onto the sidewalk outside and began to choke her.

San Angelo Police chief Tim Vasquez told the San Angelo Standard Times: 'In my time here this is probably the most horrific homicide involving a child. It’s not the only one we’ve had, but definitely for me its one of the most horrific we’ve had.'

Police say Delacruz forced his way into the home through a bathroom window.

Tom Green County jail records show the 23-year-old was being held on Thursday on $1 million bond.

Online jail records don't list an attorney for Delacruz, who was arrested following Tuesday's attack and initially charged with murder.
