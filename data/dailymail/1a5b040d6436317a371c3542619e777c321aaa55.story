The report into the Royal Commission into the fatal Home Insulation program has been tabled in parliament and it's believed Kevin Rudd and senior ministers from the previous Labor Government will shoulder much of the blame for the failure.

Four installers died during the $2.8 billion scheme, set up as part of the economic stimulus package in 2008-2009.

The Federal Government established the $16 million inquiry soon after Tony Abbott became Prime Minister and it has now been received the long-awaited findings.

Mr Abbott said the failures arose from 'a dysfunctional culture'.

'The government will carefully consider the findings and the recommendations of this report, which is a timely reminder of what can happen if government acts with undue haste,' Mr Abbott said.

A preliminary response is expected by the end of September and a final response by year's end.

'The government's response will focus on ensuring that such a catastrophic policy failure never happens again,' Mr Abbott added.

The inquiry was told of serious program flaws, limited training for workers and a lack of system of checks to prevent rorts.

In May, former prime minister Kevin Rudd told the commission he accepted ultimate responsibility for the program's failings.

Former Labor environment minister Peter Garrett, parliamentary secretary Mark Arbib and numerous public servants all had duties to monitor certain issues, Mr Rudd said, although he did not directly implicate anyone.

The $16 million Royal Commission was established by Prime Minister Tony Abbott soon after the Coalition came into power. He has tabled the report in parliament calling the program 'a catastrophic policy failure'

During his testimony, Mr Garrett said he accepted ultimate responsibility, as the person charged with rolling out the scheme.

'We share responsibilities with those other institutions that equally have them, such as state regulatory bodies, employers, ultimately employees as well,' Mr Garrett told the Commission. 

But he too said others should share the blame.

Installers Matthew Fuller, Rueben Barnes, Marcus Wilson and Mitchell Sweeney died in 2009 and 2010, three by electrocution. The program was stopped on February 19, 2010.

The Royal Commission was told:

On October 14, 2009, Matthew Fuller, 25, was electrocuted laying insulation sheeting in the ceiling cavity of a house in Meadowbrook, Queensland. He had started work with the company 12 days earlier.

November 18, 2009. Rueben Barnes, 16, was electrocuted laying batts in the ceiling cavity of a house at Stanwell, also in Queensland. He had started with the company 21 days earlier.

November 21, 2009. Marcus Wilson, 19, died from hyperthermia complications after installing insulation batts in a St Clair home in Sydney's western suburbs in 40C heat.

February 4, 2010. Mitchell Sweeney, 22, was electrocuted laying insulation sheeting in the ceiling cavity of a home at Millaa Millaa, Queensland. He had started at a new company a week earlier.

The Commission heard that the abolishing of the $2.8 billion scheme in February of 2010 ultimately destroyed many small businesses

On 29 March, Royal Commissioner Ian Hanger QC made a request for additional time to produce his report into the Home Insulation Program.

The Royal Commission stated that 'this additional two months will enable Commissioner Hanger to thoroughly consider the large volume of evidence that has been received'.

Since it was established on 12 December last year, the Royal Commission held 37 days of public hearings, where it heard from more than 50 witnesses, undertook over 120 interviews and issued 125 summons to produce documents.

The Royal Commission also received 70,000 relevant documents in response to summonses, and further documents are still being received by the Commission.

AAP reports that the inquiry heard former prime minister Kevin Rudd and his former minister Peter Garrett accepted 'ultimate responsibility' for the program, but said public servants failed to advise of safety risks.

Bureaucrats were warned five months before the program's roll-out that three New Zealanders had been electrocuted using metal staples to secure foil. After the first death, industry advice that foil should be banned wasn't heeded.

Senior bureaucrats said they were given two days to cost the scheme. Public servants believed the July 1, 2009 roll-out deadline denied them time to consider safety risks, but Mr Rudd said they should have asked for an extension.

Plans to train all installers were abandoned, allowing workers to enter roof cavities after undergoing a general safety induction provided they were supervised. But the government had no way of guaranteeing on-site supervision.

Mr Rudd controversially used details of secret cabinet proceedings to reveal that even after people started dying, bureaucrats advised the scheme was reportedly 'on track'.

The program had attracted so-called 'shonky' operators who failed to supervise inexperienced installers and claimed payments for work that had never taken place.

But the scheme's early termination also led to the financial ruin of established insulation companies, with some losing millions of dollars.
