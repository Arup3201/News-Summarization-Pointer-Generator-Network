Everton hope to announce a breakthrough over a new 50,000-capacity stadium this week.

The club believe Goodison Park, their home since 1892, can no longer generate sufficient revenue from a maximum capacity of 39,600. 

Everton want to move to nearby Walton Hall Park and have been talking to the council.

Premier League club Everton hope to announce a breakthrough over a new 50,000-capacity stadium this week

In April, Liverpool City Council reaffirmed its commitment to working with Everton on the prospect of a new stadium.

It was last year the Toffees revealed they were exploring options for a new home inside the city boundaries of Liverpool. 

Everton did not find themselves at Goodison on their return from the international break, but claimed three points nonetheless as they beat West Bromwich Albion 2-0.

Romelu Lukaku and Kevin Mirallas were both on target for Roberto Martinez's men at the Hawthorns.
