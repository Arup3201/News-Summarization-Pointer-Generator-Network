Michael Carrick says he still hopes to be involved in Manchester United’s clash with Chelsea on Sunday after playing just over an hour for the Red Devils’ Under 21s against West Ham.

Carrick barely broke into a sweat as he sat in front of a back four, reading the game with trademark intelligence as he coasted through their 2-1 win.

He returned to the bench for United’s 2-2 draw at West Brom on Monday but manager Louis van Gaal seemed to have ruled him out of Sunday’s game, claiming the midfielder needs more minutes under his belt as he returns from an ankle injury.

West Ham U21s: Howes, Westley, Page, Makasi, Onariase, Pask, Bywater, Nasha, Lee, Lletget, Gordan.

Subs: O'Hara, Grimshaw, Love, Goss, A.Fletcher.

But Carrick insists his appearance at West Ham’s academy ground on Friday night does not mean he is ruled out of contention on Sunday and the England midfielder says he still hopes to play a part against the league leaders at Old Trafford.

Carrick, speaking exclusively to Sportsmail, said: 'I'm realistic, I've got to be patient. I've been out for five and a half months so I've got to understand the bigger picture. I'm not saying I won't be involved on Sunday, hopefully I can be in some way.

'I don't know yet though, I'll just have to wait and see. I'm just being patient really, I've got to understand the situation.

'It's been a long time. I've been injured for three months but I've been out for five and a half months since my last game so to get back was a big step really.'

The 33-year-old has not played a competitive game since United’s 1-1 draw at Southampton on the final day of last season and underwent ankle surgery in July – on the day Van Gaal was unveiled by the club.

He has since spent three months on the sidelines as United have struggled to put last season’s travails behind them, picking up just three wins from their opening eight league games along with an embarrassing exit from the Capital One Cup after a 4-0 drubbing at the hands of MK Dons.

Van Gaal has toyed with different systems but struggled to find a player to protect his defence, despite the best efforts of new signing Daley Blind, and is keen to get Carrick back into the fold.

Carrick played 64 minutes against a West Ham academy team – where he started his professional career – and sat in front of a back four, rarely pushing himself into an attacking area as he looked to dictate the play and provide United’s young attackers with some forward thrust.

United won the game after James Wilson’s fine opener had been levelled by West Ham’s Elliot Lee, before Will Keane grabbed a 78th-minute winner, 14 minutes after Carrick had been replaced.

His inclusion in the match, under 48 hours before the Sunday’s game, as well as Van Gaal’s pre-match comments, seem to suggest the midfielder is unlikely to play, despite his desire to get back to Premier League business.

Van Gaal had said: 'I'm sorry to say no other players are back, even if I let Carrick play in London for reserves because he needs to play matches when you are five months injured. He told me it was his first game for the reserves.'

But Carrick was still pleased to get some game time at the Hammers’ Rush Green academy ground, 10 years after leaving the club for Tottenham in a £3.5million deal.

'They started using [Rush Green Stadium] just as I was leaving,' he added. 'The last time I was here was to watch my brother [Graeme] play. He was at West Ham just as I had left really. But it's nice to be back and see a few old faces.'
