Snooker legend Stephen Hendry has left his wife of 19 years and their two sons for a children's theatre star 20 years his junior.

The 46-year old walked out on his wife Mandy and is now seeing 26-year-old Lauren Thundow - who has starred in a stage production of the TV show Noddy in Toyland.

Distraught Mandy, also 46, said she is 'heartbroken' over his decision to leave the family home in Perthshire, Scotland, he shared with his wife and children Blaine, 17 and Carter, nine.

The couple married at Muthill Parish Church in Perthshire in 1995 - 11 years after they first met at a Pontin's camp in Wales, when Hendry was just 16.

Mandy confronted Hendry last summer when she became suspicious he was having an affair - they tried to save their marriage but split two months ago.

Mrs Hendry said: 'Following Stephen's retirement I had been looking forward to spending more time as a family watching our boys growing up together.

'I am heart-broken that Stephen has made the decision to leave the marital home, relocate to England and pursue a new relationship with someone else.

'This is a very difficult time for myself and my family, however my main priority is the well-being of my children, Blaine & Carter, during this period of transition.

'This is a very trying and emotional time, and so I would ask for the same compassion and privacy that you would give to anyone going through a similar situation.'

Hendry, born in South Queensferry, Edinburgh, is the most successful snooker player in history - earning millions over his 27 year career.

The seven time World Champion met Lauren Thundow last July while working on The Snooker Legends Tour. Lauren, who also appeared in Fifi and the Flowertots, lives with her parents near Berkshire's Sandhurst military base.

A friend revealed: 'She could not help falling for a married man. There is guilt there, but Stephen told her his marriage was over.'

Mandy grew suspicious that Hendry was having an affair after she noticed he was withdrawing from family life.

She confronted him and he confessed to seeing someone else, he has moved out of the family home in Auchterarder, Perthshire and is believed to be staying in hotels.

Upon the discovery, Miss Thundow deleted her Facebook account on the recommendation of Hendry.

A friend said: 'It was apparent to Mandy last July that something was wrong with Hendrys demeanour and he seemed out of sorts. Mandy badgered Stephen into eventually making some sort of partial confession that he was seeing someone else.

'The couple tried to make it work it again but it wasn't happening.

Hendry and his wife, parents to Blaine, 17 and nine-year-old Carter, overcame tragedy in 2003 when she miscarried over halfway through the pregnancy.

The friend added: 'You can understand how hard this has hit Mandy.

'She was a loyal and supportive wife and mother during all those long years when Stephen was travelling the world.

'So she was looking forward to his retirement from the game and the chancefor her and the boys to spend time enjoying a bit of normal family life.

'That's a pretty simple thing to expect after 30 years together. She never saw this coming and is totally devastated.

'But she is picking herself up and is quietly determined to get on with her life and focus on her boys.'

Thundow, who lives in an exclusive estate in Sandhurst, played robot Whiz in the anniversary stage show of Noddy in Toyland in August 2009

She also landed a minor role in the stage version of Fifi and the

Flowertots before getting a job as an official at a series of Snooker Legend exhibition games.

Before finding love with Hendry it is believed Miss Thundow worked at a Butlins family resort.

A close friend of Hendry said: 'I honestly never would have guessed Stephen and Mandy would split up.

'He is not the kind of guy who had a different profile in the media to what he's like at home. He has always been a genuine bloke.'

Both Hendry and Ms Thundow declined to comment. Hendry became the youngest professional snooker player aged 15, and went on to become the youngest ever World Champion at 21.

He has won the World Championship seven times, and was snooker's world number one
