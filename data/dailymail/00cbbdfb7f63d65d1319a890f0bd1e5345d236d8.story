Campaigners threatened to take legal action against the Government yesterday after it published a 50,000-page dossier on HS2 – which the public have barely 60 days to read.

Consultation on the £50billion rail project runs until January 24, so readers would have to plough through more than 800 pages a day – the equivalent of reading War and Peace around 35 times.

The Bill had its first reading in Parliament yesterday. Details revealed include the amount of land required for the project – about 2,500 hectares of high quality agricultural land and 2,300 hectares of poorer quality land.

Campaigners have been given just 60 days to read a 50,000 consultation report on HS2

This could be reduced after 
construction to 1,500 hectares and 1,300 hectares respectively. Overall 
the project will require the demolition of 339 homes and 21 community 
facilities.

Together with its environmental statement, the Bill weighs around 1.5 tonnes, roughly the same as a small car.

Councils
 and countryside campaigners accused ministers of forcing the Bill 
through by giving the public a 56-day formal consultation period to read
 and comment on it.

When 
weekends and the Christmas holidays are taken into account it leaves 
residents and critics only 35 working days to check for ‘the devil in 
the detail’, they add. 

The 51M Alliance said Government had 'lamentably failed' to make the business case for the project and described it as an 'economically and environmentally disastrous white elephant'

Campaigners
 say it will be impossible to absorb the full impact on homes and 
countryside from the ‘fatally flawed’ HS2 scheme in such a short time.

Council leaders complained that ministers were treating the public ‘with contempt’.

There are:

The
 row developed as the legislation – a so-called ‘paving Bill’ giving the
 Government powers to construct and operate the high-speed railway 
between London and Birmingham – was given its first reading.

Lawyers
 for the Campaign to Protect Rural England said the tight timescale is 
likely to breach international law. They are preparing to challenge it 
in the United Nations.

Transport
 Secretary Patrick McLoughlin says work will begin within four months. 
The HS2 environmental statement for the first phase from London to 
Birmingham runs to 49,814 pages while the Bill itself is 332 pages – 
50,146 pages in total.

The 200-page introduction alone is an inch thick when printed out, making the 50,000 pages around 21ft.

The
 entire dossier runs to 585  volumes broken down into 26 geographical 
areas. A spokesman for the Woodland Trust, which has hired a full-time 
expert to read the report, said: ‘To finish it by the end of the 
consultation period would be like reading War and Peace every other day.
 We feel the timetable given to read and respond is unfair.’

Ralph
 Smyth, barrister and senior transport campaigner for the Campaign to 
Protect Rural England, said the United Nations convention on such 
matters requires ‘sufficient time ... for the public to prepare and 
participate effectively during the environmental decision-making’.

The
 CPRE will be raising the UK’s ‘non-compliance’ with the UN, complaining
 that the ‘reckless timetable’ will make it ‘impractical for the public 
to suggest sensible changes to improve the proposals’.

But the Department for Transport insisted it was not illegal, and said it was being ‘fully open and transparent’.

While
 the public could begin reading the document online yesterday, the 
56-day formal consultation period runs from November 29, 2013 to January
 24, 2014.

The extent to which homes, the environment, beauty spots and local communities will be blighted is buried within the vast 50,000 pages of the new HS2 Bill and its linked reports.

It notes: ‘Overall, the project will require the demolition of 339 dwellings and 21 community facilities.’

It says ‘community wide adverse effects’ in which ‘a substantial number of local people are significantly affected’ by HS2 construction include: Regent’s Park Estate, Camden; Park Village East, Camden; Wells House Road, Ealing; South Heath; Thorpe Mandeville and Lower Thorpe; Chipping Warden; Burton Green; Gilson; Water Orton; and the small rural community which lies between Weeford and Whittington in Staffordshire.

At least two sites of special scientific interest will be ‘affected’ and construction of the project will require  approximately 2,500 hectares of high-quality agricultural land and 2,300 hectares of poorer quality agricultural land.

It notes: ‘Wherever reasonably practicable, the land required temporarily for construction will be re-instated, reducing the amount of agricultural land lost to approximately 1,500 hectares of high-quality and 1,300 hecatres of poorer quality.’

Although HS2 will not require the demolition of any Grade I or Grade II listed building, some will  be ‘affected,’ the report notes. ’The project will affect Edgcote battlefield and one scheduled monument (Grim’s Ditch).'

Some 18 Grade II listed buildings will be directly affected. ‘Six will be demolished, four will be altered and eight will be removed and relocated’ it says.

‘There will be modification to a boundary wall to the Grade I listed Hartwell House. Two Grade II registered parks and gardens and 81 lengths of historic hedgerow will be directly affected.'

Planting will be used at Hartwell House registered park and gardens near Aylesbury ‘to ensure that the rural character of its setting is preserved'.

And although ministers insist that  no ‘internationally designated’ sites of special scientific interest  will be affected, two UK ‘nationally designated’ sites will be.

The report says: ’In the Waddesdon and Quainton area there will be measures to reduce the impact on Bechstein’s bat (a European protected species). Measures will be put in place to allow bats to fly safely across the railway line between areas of woodland habitat.’

Similarly, it adds: ‘In the Ladbroke and Southam area an area of woodland in Windmill Hill Spinney will be lost. Approximately 11ha of woodland and scrub planting and 7.7 hectares of species-rich grassland will be created adjacent to this area to compensate for that loss. This compensatory habitat will be suitable for a range of species including butterflies and bumblebees.’

The extent to which homes, the environment, beauty spots and local communities will be blighted is buried within the vast 50,000 pages of the new HS2 Bill and its linked reports

The report notes: ‘HS2 Ltd has engaged with Natural England in order to identify and put in place appropriate measures to mitigate or compensate for the effect of the project on these nationally designated sites.

‘Where adverse impacts cannot be avoided, HS2 Ltd has included mitigation and compensation measures to reduce effects on species and habitats.'

But the Woodland trust said: ‘Looking at our analysis of the 21 ancient woods under threat, we believe there are at least three Sites of Special Scientific Interest threatened. These would be Long Itchington Wood in Warwickshire,  Sheephouse Wood in Buckinghamshire and Ranston Covert/Battlesford Wood which are part of the Colne Valley in Bucks. ‘

The HS2 environmental report  says that of a total ‘Phase One’ route distance between London and Birmingham of approximately 143 miles (230km), about 33 miles (53km) is in tunnel, and about  46 miles (74km) is in cutting.

Some 40 miles (65km) of the route is on embankment and  12 miles (19km)  is on bridges and viaducts.

The report notes that the route has been kept ‘low in the landscape where reasonably practicable’.

‘At Greatworth, Chipping Warden and Aston le Walls the route will be in cutting and tunnel to avoid landscape and visual effects on these rural villages.

‘Through the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB)  between Chalfont St. Giles and Wendover, a distance of over 20km (12 miles), measures have been incorporated into the design of the project to limit landscape and visual effects.'

This includes 7.5 miles of tunnel and 3.5 miles of cuttings. ‘This will avoid or greatly limit the visibilityand noise of the railway in the rural landscape.’

Construction will generate about 128 million tonnes of excavated material and almost 5 million tonnes of waste to be disposed of to landfill.

‘HS2 Ltd has selected a route alignment with the aim of avoiding the highest quality agricultural land, insofaras this can be reconciled with the need to satisfy or balance a number of other important environmental and engineering considerations.’

Some 67 dwellings will be ‘significantly affected by noise from the operation of the railway’.
