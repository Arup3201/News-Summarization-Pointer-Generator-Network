A former Australian Defence Force contractor who sent a series of  emails detailing his sexual exploits with women - including a secretly recorded video of him having sex - to other defence personnel has been sentenced to 15 months imprisonment.

But the judge has asked Hastings Fredrickson be assessed for an order that would have him serve the term in the community rather than behind bars.

Calling himself the 'Wolf of Woolloomooloo', the 41-year-old sent degrading emails in 2010 to colleagues who were part of an 'adolescent boy's club' called the 'Jedi council'.

In one sent to four ADF email addresses, Fredrickson included images of a woman whom he had secretly filmed while having sex with her.

Describing her as 'Melbourne Mistress/Melbourne Mole #5', he told the group he would no longer be able to email as regularly because his wife was about to give birth.

Two days later, Fredrickson sent an email titled 'interesting menu', with photographs of a female senior officer whom he expressed interest in having sex with.

In sentencing him on Monday for three counts of using a carriage service to menace, Judge Peter Lakatos condemned Fredrickson's behaviour, saying it was exploitative and demeaning of women.

Fredrickson, he said, had shown little remorse.

The court heard Fredrickson felt he was 'acutely unattractive as a child' and, following a 'severely disrupted' childhood, had joined the army at 16.

He went to Afghanistan but did not see combat there and left the ADF in 2009.

At the time of his offending, he was employed as a defence force contractor and was in the army reserves.

The court heard Fredrickson saw these sexual exploits as 'having notches on the board' and likened anal sex to 'stealing a woman's soul'.

Fredrickson will return to court next month to determine whether he can serve his sentence via ICO

In a sentence hearing last month, one of his victims described the toll his actions had taken on her.

'Women are not objects for you to play around with,' she told the court.

'You don't own us, you don't take our bodies, you don't take our minds.'

Fredrickson will return to court next month to determine whether he can serve his sentence via way of an intensive corrections order (ICO).
