Four University of Nebraska-Lincoln students have been arrested after a freshman died of alcohol poisoning. 

Clayton Real, 18, was found dead in a room at FarmHouse fraternity house near campus on September 5.

The students, who are members of the fraternity, each face a felony charge of procuring alcohol to a minor resulting in death. 

They were sent to the Lancaster County jail, and a hearing is scheduled Friday.

Three other students, including another fraternity member, face citations.

Affidavits show Mr Real's cause of death was acute alcohol intoxication and his blood alcohol content was .365.

Following the arrests, the school suspended the fraternity chapter indefinitely.

The decision means more than 20 freshmen living in the house will need to find another place to live, according to university spokesman Steve Smith. 

The university requires freshmen to live on campus, and the house will no longer be approved for such purposes.

'We have taken appropriate action, given the seriousness of the matter,' said Juan Franco, the university vice chancellor for student affairs.

The affidavits indicate fraternity members hosted a party at a separate house the night before Mr Real was found. 

Alcohol was provided to underage attendees, including Mr Real, according to the documents. Witnesses told investigators that Real became intoxicated and passed out. 

He was brought back to the fraternity house and was left to sleep in his room, according to the affidavits.

Smith said it's too early to say what disciplinary action the students may face from the university.
