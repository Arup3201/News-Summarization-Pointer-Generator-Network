She may be known for her gleaming, blonde locks, but Gwyneth Paltrow has made no secret of the fact she can’t style her own hair.

Such is her love of a professional look, she invested in a chain of U.S. blow-dry bars last year. The first branch has just opened in London, offering seven Hollywood hairdos inspired by the actress, who is also the creative director — all at just £28 a throw.

Sleek Volume: Fellow blonde Mandie Gower (pictured) made her way to Blo, in Covent Garden, to try out some of Gwynnie's signature looks

Blo, in Covent Garden, promises to bring Gwyneth’s signature looks to busy British women. The chain also has to satisfy her eco-credentials, so the salon does not use styling products that contain any chemical preservatives — called parabens — or sulphates.

As a customer, all you have to do is point at the look you like best on the salon menu before you sit back for 45 minutes and sip a green tea as the stylist gets to work.

Fellow blonde Mandie Gower went along to try four of Gwynnie’s most distinctive styles, and see if it really is possible to get Hollywood hair on the cheap.

SLEEK VOLUME

Sleek Volume: Gwyneth rocked the 'sleek volume' at the 2005 Oscars (pictured) 

The style: The salon’s name for this look is the Red Carpet. Gwyneth rocked a similar look at the Oscars in 2005.

And even the shampoo the stylist is rubbing into my hair has Hollywood connections.

The salon uses a range called Unite by Beverly Hills celebrity hairdresser Andrew Dale and is free from paraben preservatives and sulphates.

It turns out this is the first of many products that I need to be red carpet-ready. There’s a conditioner, then a mousse, followed by volumising spray. Then a slick of another Gwynnie favourite — argan oil.

Once my pampered hair has been rough-dried, my Blo stylist Sundya divides it into small sections, rolling each one up into pin curls and securing them on my head with a grip.

Another blast with the hairdryer and these are gently unrolled. Sundya then backcombs the roots before smoothing and separating the curls and fixing the whole look with a whoosh of hairspray.

Verdict: My hair has more energy and bounce than Gwyneth after a pint of organic green juice.

And it feels beautifully soft and natural rather than set and brittle. It’s me, but with added va-va voom. Result! 5/5

TOUSLED TRESSES 

The style: This just-got-out-of-bed look, called Pillow Talk, is easy to achieve when you have your own Beverly Hills celebrity stylist on speed dial.

But if my pillows could talk, they would swear blind they’d never seen my hair looking like this first thing in the morning.

Sundya reveals Gwyneth’s secret — a salt-water spray to give the hair that matt, slept-in look.

Once she’s sprayed this on and blow-dried my hair using a medium round brush, she twizzles small sections into tight twists, and winds them individually around the barrel of a tong, holding them in place with her fingertips for about 15 seconds each.

‘This gives more of a wave than a curl,’ she says.

She then gently brushes through the Medusa-like tendrils to create a more relaxed effect, before fixing it with hairspray.

Verdict: I don’t look ‘sensual and innocent’, as promised on the salon menu.

Even ‘messy beach waves’ doesn’t describe my hair at the end of 45 minutes.

Far from looking like the sexy surfer girl I had imagined, I am reminded of a bowl of spiral pasta. 2/5

AMAZING GRACE

The style: Gwyneth is no stranger to an up-do. Sundya says the key is ‘all about prepping the hair for a sleek finish’, and I soon discover this involves lots of products, from leave-in conditioner to a ‘Lazer Straight Relaxing Fluid’ which smoothes frizz. My hair is blown straight and pulled into a high ponytail.

To create the topknot — Gwynnie calls this look the High Society — the ponytail is divided into thick sections and tonged into a chunky curl to help coax a rounded bun shape out of my straight hair. As Sundya works her way round the ponytail, she carefully fans out each section, spreading and pinning it to create the bun.

Verdict? Forget Gwyneth Paltrow. When I look in the mirror through the fog of hairspray, I swear I can see Grace Kelly. The menu ‘guarantees this coif will get you what you want’, and it’s true, my bun stays firm and perky all day, even winning a few compliments from strangers. 4/5

BACKCOMB PONYTAIL

The style: Gwyneth rocked a beehive at a Louis Vuitton event a few years ago.

But as I soon discover, this is a seriously high–maintenance look — not for nothing the salon calls it the Hunt Club — that takes a lot of backcombing.

The vigorous brushing begins after my hair’s been washed and dried. And I panic at the sight of the matted bird’s nest on the top of my head. But minutes later Sundya has pinned it back and miraculously smoothed away the coarse texture with a brush, while keeping all the volume.

The lower lengths (which weren’t backcombed) are swept into a side ponytail and fixed with a minimal band. Sundya then wraps a small section of hair around the band to cover it — the ultimate Gwynnie touch.

Verdict: My ponytail looks a bit sparse compared with the enormous pouffe on top of my head. The menu suggests it is ‘a polished look for an impromptu polo match’. Sorry, but there are none of those going on where I live. 3/5
