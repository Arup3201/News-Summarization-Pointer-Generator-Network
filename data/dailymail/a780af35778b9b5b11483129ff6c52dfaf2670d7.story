Wolves chairman Steve Morgan has been fined £2,500 and warned about his future conduct by the Football Association.

The fine comes after Morgan confronted referee Mike Jones on the touchline at the final whistle of Wolves' 2-1 Sky Bet Championship defeat to Bournemouth this month.

Morgan apologised for his actions the following day, having been frustrated with the dismissals of Rajiv van La Parra and Matt Doherty.

Morgan admitted becoming frustrated by sendings off, which also included Matt Doherty

Wolves had Van La Parra's red card overturned but failed in an appeal against Doherty's sending off.

Morgan said after the incident: 'I would like to apologise personally to Mike Jones.

'I was extremely angry and frustrated at many of his refereeing decisions, and I still am.

'However, I should not have gone pitch side to vent my frustrations.'
