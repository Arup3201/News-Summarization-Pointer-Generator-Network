A California teen who gained internet fame as 'Instagram's richest kid' is now living the down and out life in jail for committing the lowly act of selling a stolen iPhone online.

While 18-year-old Param Sharma's Instagram antics often included him showing off his multiple iPhones, he claims it was someone else's that he listed on Craigslist as a favor which won him a 90-day sentence August 18.

As of Thursday, the self-proclaimed rich kid was still behind bars at the Santa Rita jail, apparently unable to cover his $30,000 bond.

Police said the phone was stolen. Sharma charged with a misdemeanor crime of failure to make a reasonable effort to find the owner of the phone.

Sharma and his attorney Andrew Shalaby claim Sharma was simply selling the phone for a friend who was unable to do it himself.

Shalaby also said his client is the first person ever convicted of the obscure charge in the state of California and that the bond set does not match the low-level crime.

'The police knew him and were unhappy with his social media accounts. $30,000 bail is not something that could be done for these charges,' Sharma’s attorney told Buzzfeed.

By some bureaucratic mishap, Sharma had the misfortune of spending some of his sentence in a high-security psych ward.

"He's in block F, according to the sergeant. here, the worst of the worst in the section of a psych ward,' Shalaby told KGO. 'Somebody tried to kill him and I was really, really upset.'

After two weeks, Sharma was returned to a normal jail cell.

Shalaby has filed an appeal on behalf of his client, who he tells Buzzfeed could see his release any day now.

Lavish P, as he's known, allegedly from the San Francisco Bay Area, became an internet celebrity after his Instagram feed went viral around the web.

Lavish flaunts his wealth in a number of ways, including doing 'cash givaways' and tying wads of cash to a balloon before watching it disappear in the sky.

He also claims only to go to the bathroom if the toilet is filled with sparkling water, which he allegedly also uses to wash his hands.

Although most people keep their money in the bank and pay by card, Lavish is a big fan of cash.

When he is not busy giving it away on Instagram he posts pictures where he bites it, uses it as a pretend phone, or 'bathes' in it.

However not everyone is buying what Lavish is selling. Since his extreme displays of wealth hit the internet he has been accused of being everything from an arts project to a successful internet troll.
