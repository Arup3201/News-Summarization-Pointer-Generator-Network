Dozens of debutantes from around the world turned out in their best outfits for a Russian ball to revive the tradition of holding the lavish events abroad.

About 1,000 people gathered for the ball in London last night, which saw a surprise performance by the Bolshoi ballet.

Guests who paid up to £790 a ticket for the prestigious event were treated to performances from Russian opera singers and orchestras while debutantes danced the Waltz in impressive flowing gowns.

More than 100 debutantes took part in the Russian ball on Sunday evening, to revive the tradition of holding the dances abroad  

The event aimed to recreate the lavish balls of Tsarist Russia that have previously been held abroad, marking the 'coming out' of young debutantes and giving them the opportunity to meet potential suitors. 

Sixty couples with Russian heritage opened the ball - including 25 from the UK who competed for the places earlier this year. Applicants had intereviews where they were judged on their knowledge of foreign languages, literature, history and art.

Russian debutantes were required to be able to dance the waltz, while for the English attendees classes were held throughout the summer to ensure they perfected their steps for the main event.

Other debutantes at the ball came from America, Georgia, Malta and Estonia, and all danced the Waltz of the Flowers from Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker. 

Venera Gimadieva, a soprano who sang at Glyndebourne Opera Festival this season and has previously appeared at the Proms, and Vasily Ladyuk, Russia's number one baritone, performed at the event held at Old Billingsgate Hall in London.

The Russian Virtuosi of Europe chamber orchestra, conducted by Felix Korobov, as well as the Vienna State Ballet also appeared at the ball.

Debutantes have spent months preparing their dance moves and their dresses for the Russian ball, held in London last night 

A total of 120 debutantes from Russia, the UK, America, Estonia and Malta were at the event where tickets cost as much as £790

Among the attendees were Olga Kostyantynivna Kurylenko, a French actress, and Russian princess Olga Andreevna Romanoff, a descendant of the House of Romanov.

Dances included the Russian quadrille, Polonaise​, Viennese waltz, cha-cha-cha and rumba.

Debutante balls have been seen throughout history as a rite of passage for young upper class women.

The tradition of the debutante ball was first introduced by King George III in 1780 as Queen Charlotte's Ball to celebrate his wife's birthday. Up until 1958, young debutantes used to be presented to the Queen at Buckingham Palace, until Prince Philip pointed out that it was 'bloody daft'.

Princess Olga Romanoff agreed to be patron of the event and said: 'I would like to believe that the Russian Ball will become a good tradition, and the bringing together of cultures will continue despite everything that is happening in the world.'

Girls taking part in the Russian ball had to be at least 16 and no older than 25. They also had to be single and either employed or studying at University. Men were required to be no older than 28.

Dr Elisabeth Smagin-Melloni, one of the organisers, said: 'My mission is to bring together people from different cultures and give them the opportunity to form lasting bonds through their appreciation and enjoyment of music and the performing arts.' 

Girls at the event stuck with the debutante tradition and wore white. But the event was not as strict as the Viennese Debutante Ball, held earlier this month, where all wore matching white gowns and lace gloves. This ball is one of the most highly anticipated in the social calendar in Rome.

The inaugural Russian ball was held at the Royal Albert Hall last December, where the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the Prima Ballerina of the Bolshoi Theatre, Evgenia Obraztsova, performed.
