Crusading: The Guantanamo comparison was made by lawyer Phil Shiner, pictured, a long-time scourge of alleged wrongdoing by the armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan

Listeners to BBC radio were assured that it was a scandal to compare with Guantanamo Bay and the American detention of terror suspects without time limit and without trial.

Breathlessly, reporters revealed that they had been given documents showing 85 Afghans were in a British holding camp near Kabul. This might amount to unlawful detention and internment, they said.

A little later a familiar name appeared in the BBC reports. The Guantanamo comparison was made by crusading lawyer Phil Shiner, a long-time scourge of alleged wrongdoing by the armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Indeed, it was Mr Shiner who led the case that ended with a 2010 High Court block on the transfer of detainees from Camp Bastion to the Afghan authorities, which compelled the British military to keep so many prisoners in detention in the first place.

In January 2010 he wrote on the Guardian’s website: ‘My firm’s next case focuses on the UK’s detention policy in Afghanistan, where we routinely hand over Afghans to the Afghan authorities in full knowledge of the torture, summary executions and disappearances occurring within their facilities.’

Mr Shiner, 56, was a Birmingham University graduate who became an articled clerk and then a solicitor in the city. He worked for a decade for legal firms, a council estate project, a law centre and the Barnardo’s charity before founding his own firm in 1999.

The father of five is also a visiting professor at London Metropolitan University, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics, and was awarded the title ‘Human Rights Lawyer of the Year’ in 2004.

He has repeatedly denied that he is an ‘ambulance chaser’ and calls the idea that he trawls for work‘ laughable’.

His firm, Public Interest Lawyers, made its name in Iraq, where Mr Shiner represented alleged victims of abuses by British troops, including relatives of Baha Mousa, who died in 2003 in British custody.

Nearly £3million has been paid in compensation to the family of Mr Mousa and other men. Mr Shiner sent a representative to Iraq to find and interview people who claimed to have been harmed by the British, and their claims were brought to the British courts.

Public Interest Lawyers says it is currently acting for more than 130 former detainees who allege that they or their family members were unlawfully detained, ill-treated, or killed by UK forces in Iraq.

Controversial: The detention facility at Camp Bastion, where the BBC said up to 90 Afghans are held

The firm’s interests are, however, not exclusively abroad. It says its mission is ‘helping individuals like you challenge the unlawful behaviour of those who govern us both nationally and locally’.

Its most recent highly-publicised domestic case was last month when it represented a campaign group who objected to the use of unpaid workers in Surrey libraries on the grounds they had not received equality training.

It won the case and the county council was barred by a High Court judge from using volunteers to work in its libraries. This was, said Mr Shiner, a ‘fantastic result’.

The libraries are now threatened with closure.
