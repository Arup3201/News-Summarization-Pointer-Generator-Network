A new bride was given the surprise of her life when a dazzling Hollywood cast - including Cameron Diaz, Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman - made an unexpected appearance at her wedding.

Her new husband, Sky reporter Joe Michalczuk, roped in an impressive list of A-listers to appear on a very special wedding video, which was played to the dumbstruck bride at the reception.

Hugh Jackman jokes, 'It's not too late!' on surprise wedding video

Hottie Zac Efron was first to flash up on the screen with a wink and kiss for the new bride, followed by Emma Stone who says, 'Congratulations Jenny!'

And it just gets better. The cast of The Other Woman, Cameron Diaz, Leslie Mann, Kate Upton chime in, 'Hey Jenny, congratulations!'.

'You get to spend the rest of your life with this guy...huh!' adds Cameron giving the camera a cheeky wink.

But it's Miss Piggy who steals the show. When Joe jokes that he wants to ditch bride-to-be Jenny and run off with the prima donna hog, the Muppet star screeches, 'Jenny, run for the hills -- this guy is not good!'

Another hilarious moment arises as Arnold Schwarzenegger fluffs his lines. When asked to look into the lens and  say 'Jenny, Joe will always have your back!', he comes up with a rather baffling sentiment.

'Jenny always has my bag, see ya!' he announces to the camera.

Hugh Jackman also goes off-script and jokes, 'Jenny you left Sydney and all those incredible Australian men for this guy? It's a very kind thing to do, but it's not too late....Oh, is it too late?

He then changes his tune and says, 'Hey congratulations, you've picked the best guy! He's awesome You guys will always be happy. Well done you've married up!'

Fellow Spiderman stars Jamie Foxx and Andrew Garfield also add their wishes, as do Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans.

Ty Burrell offers Joe and Jenny some advice in the guise of his Modern Family character Phil Dumphy

Modern Family star Ty Burrell also makes an appearance in the guise of Phil Dunphy. When asked what Phil's tips for married life would be he suggests: 'Make sure you and your wife watch the sunset at least once a day!

'That's very Phil Dunphy,' says groom-to-be Joe, but is quick to point out, beautiful sunsets are few and far between on English shores.

Other sparkling appearances come from Anne Hathaway, who says, 'I dreamed a dream you married Joe', in a nod to her Les Miserables character Fantine, and Kate Winslet.

The British actress conjures up an iconic screen moment from Titanic when she says, 'Jenny d'you feel like you're flying?'

After watching this fabulous video, no doubt she did.
