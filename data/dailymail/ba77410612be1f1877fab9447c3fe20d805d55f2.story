A plot to send £300 of cannabis through the mail was uncovered – thanks to two dogs at a village post office.

Staff at the post office in Frampton on Severn, Gloucestershire, thought they could smell something suspicious when a parcel was left to be sent to London.

Then two cocker spaniels belonging to the shop's owner, Frankie and Badger, started barking before tearing open the outer packaging and staff realised it contained the illegal Class B drug.

The parcel had the sender’s address inside it, and drugs squad police raided a nearby farm where they discovered four small cannabis plants.

Police said a 23-year-old man was cautioned for possession of cannabis with intent to supply.

It is understood that a relative, who did not know its contents, dropped the package off at the local post office.

A worker at the post office said: ‘The smell was horrific. The dogs were very interested in it – it really stank. It raised suspicions, as it was either a bad pair of old socks, or something that wasn’t legal.

'Obviously we were shrewd enough to know it was not something we should 
be sending. Perhaps they thought we were naive but it turned out we were
 correct.

'The police were called and they took it away. We believe it was dry matter inside.'

A police spokesman said the parcel was addressed to a recipient in London but they intercepted it before it was loaded in to a delivery van, on Thursday, March 13.

A police spokesperson said: 'We conducted a search of a premises near the post office and found three to four plants.

'He had been intending to send the cannabis to a friend in London.

'The 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession and cultivation of cannabis, and on suspicion of possession of cannabis with intent to supply.

'He was cautioned for the second offence.'
