Prince Charles asked paedophile Jimmy Savile for advice on health policy and to read over his speeches, a controversial new biography has claimed. 

The Prince of Wales and Savile were known to have had a working relationship after they met in the late 1970s while supporting wheelchair sports charities and is has long been claimed that the Prince relied on the now disgraced DJ for advice during the 1980s and 1990s.

In the biography, Charles: The Heart of a King, it is claimed that Savile was regular visitor to Highgrove and St James' Palace and was once at a meeting at Highgrove being held to discuss closures to emergency services.

The Prince of Wales asked prolific paedophile Jimmy Savile for advice about health policy and to read over his speeches and make any suggested changes to them, asking for his advice since they met in the 1970s

The book, by journalist Catherine Mayer, also claims the Prince once deferred to Savile to look over a speech he was due to give and make any changes, the Telegraph reported. 

'One source tells of an occasion when the Prince asked his famous occasional adviser to read over a speech he was due to give on a topic unrelated to health care or any field in which Savile had expertise,' wrote Mayer. She said Savile did not make any changes on that occasion. 

The book sheds new light on the extent to which the Prince relied on Savile as his confidant. 

Savile died in 2011 and was exposed as a prolific paedophile, using his celebrity status to prey on child victims. He is said to have abused hundreds of victims, taking advantage of having free run of Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Broadmoor and Leeds General Infirmary.  

The book also deals with Prince Charles' relationships, revealing that he had doubts about his wedding to Princess Diana and on the eve of the ceremony said 'I can't do it.'

Sarah Goodall, a former Lady Clerk to the Prince previously claimed in an autobiography that Savile gave marriage guidance counselling to the Prince and Princess of Wales. This claim was denied by Clarence House.

The biography also says the Prince no longer wants to promote the interests of British arms firms in the Middle East.

Prince Charles, who like other members of the Royal Family has close links to many ruling families in the Arab world, particularly Saudi Arabia, told ministers that he 'doesn't like being used to market weaponry'.

Last year BAE Systems announced a deal to sell Typhoon jets to the Saudis the day after the Prince had finished a visit to the country.

Although aides insisted the deal was 'never discussed', anti-arms campaigners said it was 'clear that Prince Charles had been used by the UK Government and BAE Systems as an arms dealer'. The book claims his objections were made 'discreetly.' 

The prince will visit the country for two days next week - for the 12th time - as part of a whirlwind tour of Arabia, also taking in Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE.

Mayer wrote: 'A source close to the Prince says he doesn't like being used to market weaponry and now sidesteps such activities wherever possible. '

The writer highlights Charles's appearance at an arms fair in Dubai several years ago, which he defended in his 1994 documentary with Jonathan Dimbleby by arguing that he was boosting trades and if the UK didn't sell them 'as a deterrent', then someone else would.

Charles is regarded as a particularly valuable asset by diplomats who believe he can gain access at the very highest level to Arab rulers in a way politicians simple cannot.

A Clarence House spokesman said last night: 'The Prince of Wales' upcoming visit to the Middle East is not about sales of defence equipment and is not essentially commercial.

'The Prince of Wales undertakes official visits on behalf of Her Majesty's Government.

'The five countries The Prince is visiting in the Middle East are important allies and key partners to the UK.

'This visit to the Middle East like others is to strengthen relationships and highlight stability in the region.

'The programme has been designed by the FCO, its Middle East Posts and Clarence House to make the most of The Prince's knowledge and expertise, and to highlight both HRHs concerns and those of the UK Government about conflict in the region.'

Prime Minister David Cameron defended Britain's close relationship with Saudi Arabia yesterday – despite its appalling human rights record – saying it had given information 'which helped save British lives'.

Prime Minister David Cameron said on Monday, saying it was important to maintain a relationship with the kingdom despite its poor record on human rights.

The British government's decision to fly the Union flag at half-mast on public buildings following the death of Saudi's King Abdullah last month drew criticism human rights campaigners and several prominent British politicians.

Asked about this decision during a question and answer session on Sky news on Monday, Cameron said the countries had a long standing relationship and it was 'a mark of respect'.

'We have a relationship with Saudi Arabia partly over things like trying to achieve peace in the Middle East but crucially over fighting terrorism ... Since I have been prime minister a piece of information that we have been given by that country has saved potentially hundreds of lives here in Britain,' he said.

While King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz pursued a modernising legacy of cautious social and economic reform, against a backdrop of regional turmoil the authorities had in the last year issued tougher penalties against all forms of dissent.

A sentence of a thousand lashes on a blogger accused off offences including insulting Islam, cyber crime and disobeying his father has also caused international outrage.

'We don't agree with lots of things that the Saudis do ... we make very clear those differences,' Cameron said.

'I would argue if you have a relationship with them and you have a way of talking to them they are more likely to listen to you than if you just cut yourself off.'
