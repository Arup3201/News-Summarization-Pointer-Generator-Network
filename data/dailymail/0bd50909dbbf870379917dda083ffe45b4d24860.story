Man of the hour: Dick Cheney was honored at a conservative dinner function in New York City on Monday

Waterboarding has been used as a punch line at a roast held to honor former Vice President Dick Cheney on Monday night.

The torture technique was used to gather intelligence from terror suspects following the September 11 attacks and subsequent wars, and Cheney was one of the most powerful advocates for the controversial move.

At the dinner, attended by a group of conservative figures, waterboarding was used as a laugh line instead, prompting outrage after news of the jokes was released.

Rupert Murdoch was one of the co-hosts
 of the event at New York's Plaza hotel, which was sponsored by 
Commentary magazine, and former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, 
former Senator Joe Lieberman, and Cheney’s former aide Scooter Libby.

Unidentified guests told Buzzfeed that there were several waterboarding jokes made over the course of the dinner, including one from Cheney himself.

He
 tried to dismiss blame for the off-color joke by attributing it to 
something that late night host Jay Leno once said, but it still came off
 as awkward and inappropriate.

Cheney
 joked that he missed the shot during an antelope hunting contest- which
 in itself is a play on the fact that the has been involved with two 
hunting accidents where he unintentionally hit friends with the bullets 
instead of the animals. Rather than killing the antelope with the 
bullet, Cheney said, he wanted to waterboard it himself.

Their decision: Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Cheney (seen here in 2003) were considered to be the architects of the policy allowing waterboarding, and that was brought up at the Monday event

‘There were some waterboarding jokes that were really tasteless,’ an unidentified guest said.

‘I can see the case for enhanced interrogation techniques after Sept. 11 but I can’t really endorse sitting there drinking wine and fancy dinner at the Plaza laughing uproariously about it.’

Rumsfeld also took a verbal shot at Cheney and his five heart attacks, saying that they helped because they ‘finally showed the world that he actually has a heart.’

One of the other crass joke came from Lieberman, who is now an Independent but served the vast majority of his time in office as a Democrat.

Lieberman ‘said something to the effect that it’s nice that we’re all here at the Plaza instead of in cages after some war crimes trial,’ a guest told Buzzfeed.

Though the roast was centered around Cheney, a number of others in his political orbit were the targets of the makeshift humorists.

Ribbing from the other side of the aisle: Former Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman was one of the politicians asked to roast Cheney, and he made a joke about avoiding war crimes charges (seen here together in 2000)

Confidantes: Dick Cheney's former aide Scooter Libby, who was indicted on charges of revealing the identity of a CIA agent (pictured together in 2005), was also selected as a roaster

Former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who served during Cheney’s time in office, was teased for his emails being leaked which suggested that he had an extramarital affair.

President Obama was mocked for allegedly allowing Russia’s Vladimir Putin dictate American foreign policy.

Scooter Libby, who was indicted over the release of CIA agent Valerie Plame’s identity, took a shot at former President Bush- who was notably not in attendance- for failing to pardon him over the charges.

‘Libby said George Bush sent a note, “pardon me, I can’t make it,”’ a guest said.
