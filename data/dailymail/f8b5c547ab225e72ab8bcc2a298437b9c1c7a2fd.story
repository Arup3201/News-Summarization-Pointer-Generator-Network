As views from the office go, it could be one of the best in the world.

Scientists working on the world's largest telescope today showed off their workplace - deep in the Chilean desert, in one of the driest places on Earth.

However, at an altitude of 16,400ft, roughly half the cruising height of a jumbo jet and almost four times the height of Ben Nevis, they did admit to some problems - having to carry oxygen to work, for example.

To be switched on today, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array,
or ALMA, is the world’s most powerful telescope. 

It is also the highest on the planet and, at almost
£1billion, the most expensive of its kind.

It is hoped it will allow astronomers to learn about our
origins by peering back to almost the first moments after the universe was
formed.

Built deep in the Chilean desert, in one of the driest
places on Earth,  ALMA is at an altitude of 16,400ft – roughly half the
cruising height of a jumbo jet and almost four times the height of Ben Nevis.

But while the site promises good scientific results, the
setting on the edge of the Andes poses difficulties for those who work there.

To keep altitude sickness at bay, as much work as possible
is done at a control centre on lower ground. 

Visits to the telescope site
are kept as short as possible and workers carry oxygen tanks.

A member of the media takes pictures of the series of parabolic antennas of the ALMA project at the El Llano de Chajnantor in the Atacama desert, some 1074 miles north of Santiago and 5000 metres above sea level

The Chilean desert was chosen because it is one of the few places in the world where it is still possible to find a high, dry location unaffected by pollution from artificial light

Rather than one single telescope, it is made up of 66 giant
antennae which gather faint radio waves from space for processing by a
supercomputer.

Costing £950million to build, including around £65million
from the UK, and billed as being ‘in search of our cosmic origins’, it is hoped
it will provide answers as to where the stars, the planets, and, ultimately where we came from.

By collecting radio waves rather than optical light, ALMA
can look through the dense dust clouds of deep space.

This will give astronomers a glimpse of galaxies from just
after the Big Bang.

It can also look at how individual stars and planets are
formed. This could shine a light on our creation as it is believed the elements
spewed out by dying stars went on the seed the sun, the planets and,
eventually, humans.

It will also tell us more about where life came from by
finding traces of compounds from water to chemicals similar those in DNA.

Brian Ellison, of the Science and Technology Facilities
Council and ALMA’s UK project manager, said: ‘It is said we
are all made of stardust.

The telescope, which was part-built by British companies, has yet to run at full power

ALMA is located 5,000 meters above Andes El Llano de Chajnantors plateau, some 50 km of San Pedro de Atacama in Chiles Second Region, in Antofagasta

Built deep in the Chilean desert, in one of the driest places on Earth, ALMA is at an altitude of 16,400ft ¿ roughly half the cruising height of a jumbo jet and almost four times the height of Ben Nevis

‘ALMA will answer certain questions about where we came
from.’

The telescope, which was part-built by British companies,
has yet to run at full power. 

But when all the dishes are operating in
unison , the resulting images should be ten times sharper than those of the
Hubble space telescope.

To get such pictures from a single land-based radio
telescope, it would have to be ten miles wide.

The Chilean desert was chosen because it is one of the few
places in the world where it is still possible to find a high, dry location
unaffected by pollution from artificial light.

Dryness is particularly important as moisture in the air
absorbs the radio waves the dishes are trying to capture.

A spokesman  for the European Southern
Observatory, which co-ordinates the European investment, said:
‘ALMA contributes profoundly to the satisfaction of curiosity, not just of the
professional researcher, but of the child who looks at the sky full of stars
and wonders what they are and what part of the universe we occupy.’

The secret to the £1 billion facility's incredible resolution comes from two factors: height and distance.

ALMA's highest receivers sit on a plateau some 16,500 feet (5,000 meters) above sea level.

This is far above most of Earth's atmosphere and water vapor, which obscures observations.

Astronomers working in ALMA's facility at 9,500 feet (2,900 meters) must use supplemental oxygen for extended stays.

The system currently comprises about 50 functional antennas.

When the array is finished, there will be 66 of these receivers that can be moved as far as 9.9 miles (16 kilometers) apart.

The
antennas capture astronomical signals from the sky individually, then 
combine their results in a supercomputer to get precise information 
about where the signals come from.

Researchers say it is similar to how we use our two ears to locate sounds around us, but on a universe-size scale.

This
high resolution not only lets ALMA observe young planetary systems, but
also pin down hydrogen and other life-building blocks in gas clouds.

The array can also track the evolution of galaxies.
