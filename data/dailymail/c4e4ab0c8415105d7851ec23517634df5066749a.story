Christine Kettyle wasn’t sure what to expect. She certainly wasn’t expecting to burst in to tears. But as she stands back and takes in this extraordinary monument to the human bonds which unite this fractious kingdom, she is overwhelmed.

‘I just feel that we’re about to see our family break up and so this has made me incredibly emotional,’ she says, before adding an impeccably British: ‘Sorry!’

We are standing slap bang on the Scottish-English border at Gretna. Before us, stands a pile of tens of thousands of rocks and stones, some painted with the Union flag, some with the Saltire, some with little messages. Most are just plain stones from all over Britain. All are a plea for unity on Thursday.

Emotion: Supporters of the UK have gathered at a cairn on the Scottish border; this image shows members of the public spelling out an N next to the round structure

Unity: This rock was painted with the Scottish and English flags by a member of the public

A lady popped in earlier after driving from the Isle of Mull to drop off a large red rock. Today’s post brought a piece of the Berlin Wall wrapped in a Union flag. It was sent by a man in Glossop, accompanied by a rather touching letter saying that the collapse of that wall in 1989 had been ‘the triumph of unity over division’.

In sending his bit of old Eastern Bloc masonry, he fervently hoped that these islands would not be going in the opposite direction.

All the stones are piled high, around a dry stone central chamber, to form a cairn -an ancient marker in the landscape - celebrating the human dimension of Union.

And since the first stone was laid in July, the ‘Union Cairn’ has grown in to a 350-ton symbol of togetherness. It is now 150 feet in circumference and nine feet tall. It was just 18 inches high at the start.

The organisers reckon there are now 75,000 stones in the pile. Since the sudden surge in support for the nationalist cause, it’s all been gathering extra momentum.

Many stones have been placed by Scots. Just as many – if not more – have been laid by Scots, English, Welsh, Irish and others who have no vote in this referendum campaign because they do not have a Scottish postcode.

They want to do something to show they care, beyond a vacuous tweet. So here is one positive, demonstrative way of showing how they feel.

To those, like Christine, who fear that everything they hold dear is about to implode, it is both moving and reassuring.

The English-born daughter of a Pole who fought with the British in the last war and became a Brit, Christine, 60, is married to a Scotsman, has two English/Scottish children and lives in Glasgow.

In other words, she is a true Brit. And she had never really felt need to question her happy jumble of dynastic and geographical allegiances until this blasted referendum business came along.

It’s the same for Frank Wilson, 70. Cumbrian-born, he is married to a Scot, lives in Scotland and has family on both sides of the border. ‘I just felt it was right to come here,’ he says. ‘But I don’t want to make a big fuss.’ Of course not. That would be very, well, unBritish.

All day, a steady trickle of cars, buses, bikes and hikers appear in the field next to Gretna’s Old Toll Bar Café which prides itself on being both the ‘First’ and ‘Last’ house in Scotland. On Saturday night, a thousand supporters gathered at the cairn for a free music festival.

Attraction: People have been coming from all over the UK to visit the cairn near Gretna

Structure: The cairn is growing ever bigger as supporters of the Union add stones to the pile

Location: The cairn is situated exactly on the border between England and Scotland, near the small town of Gretna

This is the ‘heart’ side of a debate which grows turgid and ugly whenever people get on to the ‘head’ side of things. ‘We don’t really talk much about currency here,’ says Chris Land, 28, one of the energetic young team running Hands Across The Border, the campaign behind the cairn.

Edinburgh born and bred, he is a Cambridge graduate who chucked in a London consultancy job earlier in the summer to defend the Union. If it’s a ‘yes’ vote, he says he will probably emigrate. ‘It won’t be the Britain which I feel I belong to.’

Another member of the team is Alice Bragg who has taken time off from running a London charity to help. The daughter of Lord Bragg, broadcaster and champion of all things Cumbrian, she spent much of her youth near here in border country.

‘I just can’t begin to imagine waking up and finding a steel fence right there,’ she says, gesturing at the tiny River Sark. ‘It’s like tearing up a family for no reason whatsoever.’

Like many, she has found the political aspect of the No campaign – Westminster suits dishing out home truths to the Scots – badly lacking in both excitement and momentum. This sort of campaign, she hopes, will strike a different chord.

It’s all run on a shoestring. HQ is a caravan and a table in the Old Toll Bar Café. But this is the passionate, grass roots side of the Unionist campaign. The team are encouraging people who cannot make it up the M6 – or down the A74 - to Gretna to send photos of themselves with stones to the Hands Across The Border website.

Oxford graduate Angus Aitken, a Londoner with Scottish roots, hopes to join the Army next year. He left a job on a Campbelltown fishing boat two months back to come here and do this. ‘If I am in the Army, I want it to be the British Army,’ he says quietly.

Another carload turn up and quietly admire what is going on here. An English couple, who retired to their ‘dream home’ in Dumfries, tell me that they are so worried about impending separation that they have just put their house on the market. They have even talked to their bank manager about repatriating their life’s savings to England. They won’t give me their names.

‘There are some people who, let’s just say, have not been very pleasant,’ says Mrs Anonymous. Quite a few of today’s stone layers will not be named. It’s a depressing but familiar symptom of the malevolence of certain elements in this campaign. Only the other day, the cairn team arrived to find a huge ‘Yes’ spraypainted on the stonework.

‘We have approached pretty much every celebrity, comedian and actor you can think of asking them to lend their support,’ says Rory Stewart, Tory MP for Penrith and the Border and the man who dreamed up this cairn in the first place. ‘I’m sad to say that the common response is “I’m very sympathetic but it’s not really appropriate for me to get involved.” It’s sad.’

Among the handful of famous faces who have lent support is Joanna Lumley. After her famously combative 2009 campaign to get a better deal for Gurkha veterans, she was never likely to be deterred by the bile of a few nationalists.

Putting a stone on a pile of rocks between Carlisle and Glasgow may not save the Union. But it is often the small rituals – a yellow ribbon or a bunch of garage flowers – which can suddenly accelerate in to a movement. And it is, surely, more dignified than pouring a bucket of iced water over a celebrity’s head.
