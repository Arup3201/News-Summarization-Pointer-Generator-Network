20-year-old engineering student Lucas Patchett says his latest big idea came naturally.

‘It kind of tied in with engineering in that it’s innovative, it's not wanting to do the same old, same old,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I came back from a trip overseas and said to my mate: ‘Let’s stop talking about this and just go do it!’

So they did. In July this year, Patchett and friend Nicholas Marchesi from Brisbane got busy fitting out an old van with donated washing machines to start Orange Sky: Australia’s first mobile laundry service for the homeless.

And it’s already proving a hit with many of the city's 300 people who sleep rough each night. 

'We're still at the stage where people see us and are kind of like 'what's going on here?' But word is definitely getting around and the feedback has all been positive,' says Patchett.

Patchett says there are one or two  places in Brisbane that offer free washing but that one of those is only open three days of the week, and the other gets hugely booked up. Otherwise, people have to pay $5 - $6 to do a wash at a laundromat. 

'And $6 is a lot of money for someone without a roof over their head,' says Patchett.

The Orange Sky van, which is installed with two industrial washing machines and two dryers, is currently doing the rounds of six different test locations in the Brisbane CBD. 

'We're trying to link in with some of the morning BBQs and food vans offered by different groups around the city each day,' says Patchett. 'We actually try and get there before the food vans and say to the guys: "Common, we'll get you through before everyone turns up to watch the show."

'It's been interesting because some of these guys are pretty set in their ways and some people are a little hesitant until they know us - so its been about us establishing a bit of regular schedule.'  

Patchett says his favourite part of the job is being able to sit and 'chat with interesting people' while the washing machines are churning away

One load takes about an hour and 15 minutes to wash and dry. Patchett says the thing he enjoys most about the rounds is being able to sit and chat with interesting people in that time. 

'I was chatting with a guy the other day who used to be a chemical engineer. It's just a very grounding experience to see how quickly things can go wrong for people,' he says.   

'Homelessness is the kind of issue that people turn a blind eye to but I hope that in the future, we'll be able to engage supporters and even school kids to  come out with us in the van, volunteer and get talking to people.'

In fact, Patchett says one of the reasons behind the idea for Orange Sky was what he and Marchesi saw as a lack of accessible volunteer opportunities for recent school leavers in Brisbane.  

Picking up the donated industrial washing machines

Fitting the machines to the old van was a bit of a challenge, 'but we squeezed them in,' Patchett says

He said there were one or two moments when the friends thought the idea wouldn't get off the ground. The first was trying to fit the washers into the van.  

'The architect who helped us said:  "they'll probably fit", but we found we needed to build a platform above the wheel arches - it wasn't very scientific but we ended up  banging the wheel arches out a bit and taking some panels off. We squeezed them in.'

The other issue was going through all the legal hoops to operate as a charity.

'It was very frustrating for Nick and I as we're both pretty impatient people, but we were determined not to let this keep us from hitting the road!'

 And the name? 

'Well it's our favourite colour but it's also the name of a song we really love by Alexi Murdoch,' says Patchett. 

'The song is about helping your brothers and sisters and Nic and I, not in a religious way or anything, but we live our lives by the golden rule of treating others as we'd want to be treated and living  to help other people - Everyone deserves clean clothes right?' 

Orange Sky hopes to be able to expand to provide more mobile laundries nation-wide in 2015.
