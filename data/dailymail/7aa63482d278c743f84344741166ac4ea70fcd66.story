These pictures make for an eerie throwback to a bygone era; all dusty red bricks, broken fibro walls, torn lino and worn wallpaper.

It's akin to popping the top off an 1980s time capsule. They are the properties bought up in a frenzy almost 30 years ago, when federal government thoughts first turned to a second international airport for Sydney, in the far south-western rural suburb of Badgerys Creek.

Now these once proud family homes stand idle, unloved and weather-beaten, in what resembles an urban ghost town, only playing host to itinerant rental residents, occasional squatters, brown snakes and marijuana growers.

Dozens of properties snapped up in the 1980s now lie abandoned - in many cases, no more than piles of rubble. This one was gutted by fire just a few months back with the family renting the home 'lucky to escape'

An abandoned swing-set adds to the post-apocalyptic scene in Badgerys Creek, one of the few signs that this property was once home to a family but its future, like many others in the rural suburb, is bleak with bulldozers to move in within months 

Badgerys Creek has been earmarked as the site of Australia's next major international airport. Work is set to begin in 2016 after the issue was first flagged more than 50 years ago

Market gardeners in the Badgerys Creek area have all but given up hope. Here an empty wheelbarrow, dead plants and cucumbers are lying on the floor - an eerie abandoned greenhouse where the owners have been told they will need to vacate in a few months

Marijuana plants are dotted amongst the overgrown yards - while a rusty old sign gives glimpses of a forgotten community

Tins of food, coffee mugs and various foodstuffs are strewn across benches in now-empty kitchens

The need was first flagged in the 60s

Badgerys Creek, Wilton, Holsworthy and even Canberra have been mentioned as options 

Badgerys Creek was nominated by the Hawke Government over Wilton in 1986

The buy-up of homes across almost 2000 hectares would cost the government more than $170 million

A halt was put on the plan in the year 2000 by the then Howard Government 

Tony Abbott this year announced it was on again and work is to begin in 2016

The cost is expected to top $2.5 billion 

Old toys, books and clothes litter the floors and the only sign of life is when a stray cow wanders up, hopeful for a feed.

Dozens of properties were snapped up back then, perched across almost 2000 hectares of prime real estate; now those same places can boast only overgrown backyards, pseudo garbage tips, smashed doors and other relics from the past.

There are the unpaid utility bills for the 'unknown owner' still stuffed in letter boxes and mature marijuana plants standing proudly amid the rubble.

Other, more traditional plants from market gardeners' toils have been left to wither on the vine.

The local primary school has just eight pupils and despite more than 100 years of history at Badgerys Creek Primary, it will close it doors at year's end. 

Work on the airport is expected to begin in 2016 after the commitment to build was made by Tony Abbott earlier this year.

The cost is estimated to be upwards of $2.5 billion and the first flights could be operating within 10 years - some other sticking points have emerged. They include the pledge that there will be no curfews placed on airlines, which means around-the-clock operation of the new airport (unlike Mascot) and then the predicament of just who among Australia's most famous will be honoured with the name.

Left behind: Remnants of fences, lengths of wire, a television and a stroller make up a collection of random relics in the town

Piles of old clothes, garbage and an Australian flag lie in a squalid kitchen shielded from the outside world by drawn blinds. Squatters have been making home inside some of the abandoned premises and locals say 'it's hard to know who's going in or out'

Dozens of abandoned properties are strewn across the once thriving rural suburb of Badgerys Creek, which appears closer than ever than being Australia's next major airport site with work scheduled to begin in 2016

Don't get too close: Patches of the community have been earmarked as 'Commonwealth Land'. Some residents have benefited through cheap rent but have been told to pack their bags 

Welcome to Badgerys Creek: The urban ghost town only to plays host to itinerant rental residents, squatters and marijuana growers. Even the local primary school, with more than a century of history, is to close its doors

A road to nowhere: It's hard to picture today but Badgerys Creek is destined for much greater activity with the building of an international airport in these paddocks ... for now, parts of it, resembles a ghost town

Neighbours say some of the abandoned houses should be knocked down to 'stop people going in and out'

Some places are inhabited, a few abandoned – but all share the same fate, at the mercy of a bulldozer's might, to be consigned to history

Those who've had the benefit of lower rent costs have been told to vacate by June next year

Locals tell the tale of one family's 'lucky escape' when their rental went up in flames a few months ago. This abode is now more ramshackle than renovator's delight.

'They should have knocked it down ages ago,' said neighbour Andrew. 'It's too hard to stop people going in and out of it even now.'

Some places are inhabited, a few abandoned – but all share the same fate, at the mercy of a bulldozer's might, to be consigned to history.

Those who've had the benefit of lower rent costs for the past decade have been told to vacate by June next year.

Panels of wood and sheets of metal, reduced to nothing more than scraps, strewn among overgrown fields

Liverpool Councillor and WSROC President Tony Hadchiti says it's inevitable that an airport will go ahead in the eerily sparse suburb, many backyards now home to overgrown weeds and the odd animal

Letters to no-one: Many mailboxes are stuffed with piles of unread correspondence and unopened bills

The only sign of life is when a stray cow wanders up, hopeful for a feed

A Transformers poster and a broken front door ... evidence there has been an occupant but little else

Tony Hadchiti, president of the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils (WSROC),said the old neighbourhood has to make way.

'For the first time in a long time we've seen that this (new airport) is going to happen,' he said.

'All signs are that it is full steam ahead and residents have been given their notices. 

'It will be a shame to do all this work and kick the residents out if we don't eventually see an airport here.'

Overgrown yards are a common site - complete with marijuana plant near the back door and with a decrepit boxing bag pictured hanging from a tree in the background

'A lot of families will be affected by this but in fairness 30 years ago they knew that this was going to probably be a site for an airport so I suppose it's been that political football as to if and when it was going to happen, now it is,' Mr Hadchiti added.

The Liverpool Councillor admitted a rundown neighbourhood was always on the cards.

'It is government owned land and obviously it does get neglected that little bit more than if it was owned by an individual who would come in and fix them up,' Mr Hadchiti said.

'It's ripe for people to come in and who knows what is happening in these backyards.'

Rubbish and remnants of life lie strewn across paddocks

Toys and books lie on the floor - as if the residents of this house were forced to leave in a hurry without notice

Nothing but a rusty oil drum and a wire fence guard this property
