Korea could be set for a stunning eco-makeover with a giant urban farm skyscraper.

The Urban skyfarm is 160m high, and crams over 144,000 square meters of green space into the tower.

It has just won a major design award, raising hopes construction could soon start.

The 525-foot "living" building has1 44,450sq metres of green space, and can provide locally grown food for nearby residents, as well as green space for them to enjoy.

Project Height: Sky farm (160m)

Hydroponic Farm (45m).

Total Area: Sky farm (144,450 m2)

Hydroponic Farm (13,350 m2).

Areas: Hydroponic Farm, Botanic Garden, Viewing Deck, Cafeteria, Farmers Market, Water Filtration Facility, Renewable Energy Production Facility

'The Urban Skyfarm is a vertical farm design proposal for a site located in downtown Seoul by the Aprilli Design Studio which mainly hosts local food production and distribution while at the same time contributes to the improvement of local environmental quality through water, air filtration and renewable energy production,' the designers say.

'By lifting the main food production field high up in the air, the vegetation gains more exposure toward the natural sunlight and fresh air while the ground level becomes more freed up with nicely shaded open spaces which could be enjoyed by the public', they claim.

The design is based on a tree, and the four major components which are the root, trunk, branch and leaf each have their own special characteristics which are suitable for various farming conditions

For instance, while the upper portions provide open to air farming decks for medium based vegetations, the lower portions enclosed by the structural skin provide more controlled environments for solution based leafy productions.

During daytime the photovoltaic panels generate electricity to be used for night time lighting and heating to support farming.

'The Urban Skyfarm creates a mini ecosystem which brings balance back to the urban community.'

Howe it works: The structure includes hydrophonic gardens

The tower boasts gardens and parks for people to enjoy

The tower is designed to be built in Jung-gu, Seoul, South Korea, and will provide fruit and vegetables for nearby residents.

'The Urban Skyfarm proposes to create an agricultural hub for the local community which hosts social, environmental and economical activities to enhance trade, improve the environment and benefit the local market and community.'

The Skyfarm also has 34,445 square feet of solar panels and wind turbines - enough to operate the entire structure as well as a second, neighboring hydroponic farm.
