Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice has finally publicly apologized for allegedly punching his wife before dragging her limp body from an elevator.

The 27-year-old football player, who was caught on surveillance footage in February carrying his then-fiancee in an Atlantic City casino, told reporters on Thursday that his actions were 'inexcusable'.

'You know that's not me,' he said. 'You know that's something I have to live... with the rest of my life.'

Last week, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said Rice would be suspended without pay for the first two games of the 2014 regular season - a punishment that many said failed to go far enough.

Apology: Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice said on Thursday the attack on his wife was 'inexcusable'

He was also fined an additional game check for 'conduct detrimental to the NFL,' the league said.

At the press conference, he refused to say what had triggered the incident but said he was worried that his two-year-old daughter would find out about it on Google when she was older.

'It hurts because I can't go out there and play football, but it hurts more because I have to be a father and explain what happened to my daughter,' he said, CNN reported.

'I let so many people down because of 30 seconds in my life that you know I know I can't take back.'

He called his wife Janay, who watched the press conference from a balcony, an 'angel' who could do 'no wrong' and said they were in counseling.

'My job is to lead my family, my job is lead my wife, my job is to
 lead in whatever I do,' he said. 'And If I'm not being the example, then my family
 crumbles.'

He added that his wife will speak out about domestic violence.

'When the time is right we will go out there and help as many people as we can,' he said.

Rice entered a pretrial intervention program in May, meaning he won't be prosecuted, and the charges will be expunged after a year, the NFL explained.

Rice's suspension will begin on August 30. He will miss the season opener against AFC North champion Cincinnati on September 7 and the September 11 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

But he will be eligible for reinstatement on 
September 12 and is allowed to participate in all 
aspects of training camp and preseason games.

The NFL's announcement surprised many since other players have faced far worse punishments, often for non-violent offenses.

'It is disappointing that I will not be with my teammates for the first two games of the season, but that's my fault,' Rice said in an earlier statement issued by the Ravens.

'I failed in many ways. But Janay and I have learned from this. We have become better as a couple and as parents. I am better because of everything we have experienced since that night.'

Rice has played six years for the Ravens. He is the team's career leader in total scrimmage yards and ranks behind only Jamal Lewis in total yards rushing.
