Michael Schumacher was involved in a road accident with a motorbike rider in Spain just weeks before his horror ski crash, it emerged yesterday.

The Formula 1 driver, 45, was allegedly driving a hire car when he knocked the man off his bike when he failed to give way at a roundabout.

A court is still looking into the crash in Seville on November 17. The motorcyclist apparently broke his wrist when hit by Schumacher’s rented Audi A4.

The case is not expected to go to trial as the racing driver’s insurer will pay compensation.

It comes as Felipe Massa has claimed he saw Michael Schumacher's mouth move as he spoke to him in hospital.

The
 racing driver said he feels 'very positive' about his friend's 
condition following a recent visit to the seven-time Formula One 
champion in hospital.

When asked about his friend's condition by journalists, Massa replied: 'He was sleeping, and I was very 
positive because he was normal.

Optimism: Massa says he told 'sleeping' Schumacher all about his car and prospects for the coming season

'He looks normal, and he also gave some reactions with the mouth and everything. So it's positive to look at him.

'I have no experience to say anything. I'm not a doctor. But when I saw him, for me, it looked very positive.'

It is almost eight weeks since Schumacher was placed in an induced coma following a skiing accident.

He required two operations to remove blood clots from his brain following his fall in December.

Schumacher
 is currently in what manager Sabine Kehm described as a 'waking-up process' from his coma.

Prior to this week's second pre-season 
test in Bahrain, Massa visited Schumacher at the Grenoble hospital where
 the former Ferrari star has been recovering.

Speaking to reporters at the Sakhir circuit, Massa said: 'I always try to be optimistic.

'I
 saw him, I talked to him, I told him everything I did in Jerez (at the 
first test), about my car, the new team (Williams), everything. I told 
him to wake up many times... I'm positive. We need to believe.

'It's always very difficult to say because I have zero experience about what the doctors say.

'But I saw him and was very happy to be together with him for a very long time, talking to him, trying to give the best energy and just help him.

'He's a very strong man, a very great man and I really hope he can wake up, and I really hope he can enjoy his life again.'
