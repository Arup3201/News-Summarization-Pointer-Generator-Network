One of the three U.S. university students accused of throwing Molotov cocktails during the protests in Tahrir Square has worked for a Republican congressman, it has emerged.

Derrick Sweeney, 19, initially worked on Barack Obama's election campaign in 2008, but switched allegiances and interned this year with Blaine Luetkemeyer in Washington.

The Georgetown University student from Jefferson City, Missouri, was arrested alongside two friends on the roof of a university building - where they were allegedly throwing firebombs at security forces fighting with protesters below.

Sources in the congressman's office 
said he was a 'hard worker' and 'nice', his typical duties included
answering phones and attending meetings, and he worked there from February to May.

Gregory Porter, 19, a Drexel 
University student from from Glenside, Pennsylvania; and Luke Gates, 21,
an Indiana University student from Bloomington, Indiana, were also 
detained.

The three were studying at American University in Cairo for a semester to improve their Arabic language skills.

Officials at all four universities involved said they are working with the US State Department and the Egyptian government to get the Americans released.

Video footage taken from the protests in Cairo shows at least two of the students, their faces covered by bandanas, taking part alongside the Egyptians. 

Mr Gates, the oldest of the captured students, had been sending Tweets from Cairo about attending the massive rallies.

'Earlier tonight rubber bullets a charge and then a retreat, my knee and elbow are f***** up,' he wrote two days ago.

The Twitter messages are erratic, but 
numerous. At one point, Mr Gates Tweets: 'I am a world citizen. Can I 
renounce my US citizenship on Twitter? haha' 'Honestly, hopefully I die here,' he says later.

Tens of thousands of Egyptian 
protesters have filled iconic Tahrir Square and clashed with police, 
demanding the country's interim Egyptian rulers hand over power to a 
civilian government.

Based on his Twitter activity, it 
appears Mr Gates, at least, willingly got involved in the protests. Mr 
Sweeney's mother, Joy, told CNN that she cannot believe the accusations 
against her son.

'He's a strong believer in democracy and
the right to it,' she said. 'But I don't believe he would be involved 
with intentionally harming anyone.'

She described her son as a principled 
person who stands up for his beliefs, and that he had attended previous 
protests but stopped after a demonstration where dozens were killed. He 
had assured his family the violence wasn't near him and he was safe.

She said: 'He got caught up in the whole college-change-the-world mentality, and he believes in democracy strongly.'

But she also said her son was the family peacemaker when siblings fought and she couldn't see him acting violently.

She added: 'I don't believe that he would intentionally throw a bomb at anyone. I don't believe that.'

The video footage shows the three young men standing against a wall looking into the camera. In front of them, plastic bottles that appear to be filled with liquid sit on a table.

'The three boys were throwing Molotov cocktails and had no passports on them when they were picked up,' Adel Saeed, a spokesman for the general prosecutor, said.

He said they will face interrogation by police, though they are being allowed access to State Department officials. 

They were being held at a courthouse in Cairo as night fell in the country, family members said.

'I suspect that being with a bunch of Egyptian students he probably got caught up in something. Who knows?' Mr Sweeney's father, Kevin, told the Washington Post.
