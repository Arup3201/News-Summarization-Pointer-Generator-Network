Statins can reduce erectile dysfunction by up to 25 per cent

Statins are known for lowering cholesterol but they could also improve your love life, according to a new study.

American researchers have found the commonly used drugs may benefit men with erectile dysfunction.

They now hope their findings will encourage men with high cholesterol to take their medication.

Erectile dysfunction is common in older men, especially among those with heart problems, for which cholesterol-lowering statins are frequently prescribed.

Previous research has suggested that taking statins can negatively affect testosterone levels.

This has led to questions about the effects of the widely used medication on the quality of erections.

In the first analysis of previous studies on erectile dysfunction and statins, researchers identified 11 trials that measured erectile function using the International Index of Erectile Function.

The IIEF is a self-administered survey with five questions, each scored on a five-point scale and totalled, with lower values representing poorer sexual function.

Analysis of all 11 studies combined found a statistically significant effect of statins on erectile function in men who had both high cholesterol and erectile dysfunction.

Overall, erectile function scores rose by 3.4 points in men who took statins - from 14.0 to 17.4.

This represents a 24.3 per cent improvement.

'The increase in erectile function scores with statins was approximately one-third to one-half of what has been reported with drugs like Viagra, Cialis or Levitra,' said study lead investigator Dr John Kostis, director of the Cardiovascular Institute and associate dean for Cardiovascular Research at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.

‘It was larger than the reported effect of lifestyle modification. For men with erectile dysfunction who need statins to control cholesterol, this may be an extra benefit.’

He believes that statins may work to 
improve erectile function by helping blood vessels dilate properly and 
improving vascular blood flow to the penis, which is often restricted in
 men with erectile dysfunction.

Statins are commonly prescribed for high cholesterol and doctors hope the latest findings will give men a greater incentive to take the pills

He added that while statins are not recommended as a primary treatment for erectile dysfunction in patients with healthy cholesterol levels, the added benefit may encourage more men who need statins to take them.

Dr Kostis added: ‘Rather than preventing the possibility of a heart attack in the future, the more immediate benefit of improving erectile function might improve adherence to statin therapy.’

Erectile dysfunction affects millions of men and occurs more often in those over the age of 40.

Common causes include heart disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, tobacco use, depression and stress.

Dr Kostis said that larger trials are needed to further investigate the link between statin therapy and erectile function.

The study was published online by the Journal of Sexual Medicine.
