Towered over by her classmates and weighing less than two stone, Daisy Tattersall is believed to be the smallest four-year-old in Britain.

At just 2ft 10 inches, she is much smaller than the average girl of her age, who measures at least 3ft 3 inches, according to NHS statistics.

Daisy, who lives with Jayne, 31, 
father Andrew Tattersall, 39, and sister Ruby, eight, weighs just 12.4kg - 1lb under two stone.

But her tiny stature has not hindered her progress in school or stopped her riding ponies almost twice her height, her family say.

Daisy struggled with a minor blood problem when she was born but has been in full health since having treatment for the condition.

Her
 mother, Jayne Parker, believes the early health troubles may be the reason for Daisy’s
 small stature, but she believes it is 'just a matter of time' before 
she catches up with her peers.

She
 said: ‘We are all quite small in our family. I’m only 5ft 1ins and her 
dad’s about 5ft 3. Daisy was ill when she was a baby so I think maybe 
she’s just growing a bit slower than everyone else.’

Daisy’s fellow pupils at Water Primary School in Rossendale, Lancashire, are ‘very protective’ of her, but they all treat her just like any other child in the class.

The average height of a four-year-old girl is 3ft 3ins, or 99 centimetres, according to NHS statistics.

Ms Parker said her daughter sometimes gets ‘frustrated’ when people treat her as a younger child than she actually is but otherwise her size ‘doesn’t really bother her at all’.

She added that Daisy, who wears clothes for two-year-olds, is the most energetic child she knows and likes nothing more than riding her ponies Mary and Fudge around their farm.

‘She loves going to school and playing with the other children. They’re all quite protective of her.

They all think she’s really cute but when people treat her as a younger child than she actually is, she gets a bit frustrated. But size doesn’t really bother her at all,’ she said.
