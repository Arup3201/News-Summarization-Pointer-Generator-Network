A couple has given up their life in California to embark on a transcontinental journey across the U.S. and Canada--all while hauling their home, a 125-square-foot house, behind them.

Guillaume Dutilh and Jenna Spesard spent a year building their tiny home before leaving Los Angeles behind to start a life on the road.

Now, the couple and their dog Salies are 10,000 miles and 25 states into the trek they've dubbed Tiny House Giant Journey.

Tiny House Giant Journey: Guillaume Dutilh and Jenna Spesard spent a year building their tiny home before leaving Los Angeles behind to start a life on the road in a transcontinental trek they've dubbed Tiny House Giant Journey

'We stumbled upon the tiny-house movement, and I said, "This could be cool,"' Dutilh recalled to the Marblehead Reporter during a November stop in Massachusetts. 'We’ve never built anything or gone a journey like this, and it’s a good challenge, and we can make it our own.'

The couple built the wooden dwelling on a 20 foot trailer from Tumbleweed Tiny Homes, a popular purveyor of the trendy little buildings.

According to their website, the  6’8″ wide and 10’6″ high home weighs a meager '10,100lbs with all of our belongings including water and propane.'

They pull the home between campgrounds, parks and event spaces with their 2006 Ford F-250.

The couple met online two years ago. They both worked in behind the scenes jobs in the entertainment industry.

Once they decided to build the home, it took one year to construct using reclaimed wood among other materials.

'It took a year to build it. It was suppose to be a four-month build, but it ended up being a year,' said Dutilh.

The Tiny House Movement is a growing group of people who are happy to downsize the space that they live in and enjoy simplified lives as a result.

While the average American home is around 2600 square feet, the typical small or tiny house is around 100-400 square feet.

Large homes come at a cost and most Americans spent between 1/3 and 1/2 of their income on keeping a roof over their heads, as a result 76 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck.

To escape the cycle of debt that increasing comes with the large house and the white picket fence, some people are attracted by the simplicity of the Tiny House Movement. 

One company at the heart of the movement is the Tumbleweed Tiny House Company, which teaches workshops all over the country on how to build tiny homes.

The Sonoma, California, company also offer tiny house floor plans and build homes for people who want their ‘houses-to-go’ ready-made and delivered.
