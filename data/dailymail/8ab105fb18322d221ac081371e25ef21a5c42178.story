Coles and Woolworths have stepped up their discounting wars and started slashing the prices of their top selling bread brands.

Woolworths fired the first shot last year when it discounted its Homebrand White Bread from $1 to 85 cents, and Helga's range from $5.39 down to $3.50.

Coles retaliated on Tuesday by cutting prices of top brands including Abbott's Village Bakery, Tip Top, and Wonder White by up to 34 per cent after a previous round of discounts last month.

Coles and Woolworths are slashing the prices of their top selling bread brands including Wonder White

Consumer expert Dr Gary Mortimer said the rivalry between the country's two biggest supermarkets had been progressing through different major food categories

Coles Smart Buy White Toast Bread was also slashed from $1 to 85 cents last September.

Woolworths will hit back on Wednesday by cutting the price of Sunblest bread from $2.88 to $2.50.

Consumer expert Dr Gary Mortimer said the rivalry between the country's two biggest supermarkets had been progressing through the major food categories.

'This will be referred to as the bread wars, the fight has been taken to the bakery,' Dr Mortimer, from the Queensland University of Technology, told Daily Mail Australia.

'The fight has already been had in meat and milk.

'It's been a very clear staged approach.'

Woolworths fired the first shot in the 'bread wars' last year when it discounted its Homebrand White Bread from $1 to 85 cents, and Coles followed suit

Abbott's Village Bakery Light Rye: Coles was $5.39, cut to $3.40 and Woolworths was $5.39, cut to $3. Tip Top The One: Coles was $4.19, cut to $3 and Woolworths was $3.98, cut to $3

Dr Mortimer said the supermarkets chose one major category at a time and slash prices in an effort to increase foot traffic and sales.

'They identify the best-selling lines and which ones they can they mark down drastically to create a draw card,' he said.

Coles

Abbott's Village Bakery down from $5.19 to $3.40 (down 34 per cent)

Tip Top 9 Grain down from $4.29 to $3 (down 30 per cent)

Tip Top The One down from $4.19 to $3 (down 28 per cent)

Wonder White / Wholemeal down from $4.19 to $3.30 (down 21 per cent)

Helga's Bread Varieties 680g-850g (excluding low carb varieties) down to $3.50 (down 35 per cent) 

Coles Brand Bread Varieties 700g down to $2 (down 13 per cent)

Coles Smart Buy down from $1 to 85c (down 15 per cent)

Woolworths

Homebrand bread down from $1.00 to $0.85

Helga's down from $5.39 to $3.50

Wonder White down from $3.80 to $3.30

Sunblest down from $2.88 to $2.50 

'Hopefully the customer will buy the cheap bread, but they'll also buy more expensive things.

'They pick from those categories most Australian families will buy consistently - it will probably be eggs in the next six months' time.'

On Tuesday, Coles announced it was slashing prices on a range of bread brands.

The Abbott's Village Bakery range was cut from $5.19 to $3.40. Woolworths has dropped its Abbotts Village Bakery prices from $5.39 to $3.

Coles also dropped Tip Top 9 Grain prices from $4.29 to $3 (Woolworths sells it for $4.39), and Tip Top The One from $4.19 to $3. Woolworths has dropped Tip Top The One from $3.98 to $3.

Coles also cut the price of Wonder White from $4.19 to $3.30 – the same price it sells for at Woolworths.

Dr Mortimer said Coles and Woolworths copied each other in terms of marketing and discounting because it was effective.

'They know that's how they get the punters in the door, by just replicating,' he said.

'Coles do "Down Down", Woolworths do "Cheap Cheap".'

Dr Mortimer said the move by Coles and Woolworths to discount bread was a deliberate strategy to avoid backlash from the dairy and meat industries following the much-publicised 'milk wars'.

'They won't touch milk anymore, that's still getting a lot of bad media coverage,' he said.

'There are very large lobby groups around dairy farmers.

'Where we're not seeing critics is around bread, because it's mass produced reasonably cheaply out of factories.'

Brett Hosking, president of the Grains Group of the Victorian Farmer's Federation (where grain was the state's biggest exports last year), said the bread wars were disappointing for farmers.

'It devalues what we do, effectively,' Mr Hosking told Daily Mail Australia.

'I guess one of the biggest challenges we're facing is our rising cost of production.

'Whilst our costs are rising greater than CPI it's disappointing when supermarket execs think the product isn't really worth as much.'

But Mr Hosking said the bread wars would not have the direct effect on grain growers that the milk wars had on farmers.

'I don't believe we'll see significant differences in grain price because we are a bulk export commodity,' he said.
