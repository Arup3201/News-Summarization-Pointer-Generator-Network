The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have employed their first orderly as they face big changes in their lives.

They have seconded the young Fijian-born corporal from the Parachute Regiment.

His role involves chauffeuring, logistics and even organising Prince William’s wardrobe. The Daily Mail has been asked not to name him.

Royal role: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's new orderly driving Kate to St Andrew's School in Pangbourne in November

Later that day: The Duchess of Cambridge relived her school days playing hockey on the new Astroturf at her old preparatory school

The orderly has been seen driving William and Kate on several official engagements. He drove the duchess when she visited her former preparatory school, St Andrew’s in Berkshire – where she showed off her hockey skills – in November, shortly before she was taken to hospital with acute morning sickness.

A royal aide said: ‘I have to say he is a lovely guy – like all Army, a superb can-do attitude and great sense of humour.’

The cost, which is not known, is being borne by the Ministry of Defence, and therefore the taxpayer.

The couple have so far resisted 
pressure to have a retinue of servants, employing part-time housekeepers
in Wales and London, and doing almost all their own cooking and 
shopping.

That will 
change with the duchess now pregnant and her helicopter pilot husband 
deciding whether to quit the RAF and take on more royal duties when his 
tour of duty ends next year.

Sources
insist the couple still have no plans to employ a valet, dresser or 
lady-in-waiting. One said: ‘If the duke is really stuck, then he borrows
one of his father’s valets.’

The new employee is also responsible for the wardrobe of Prince William, pictured left with his wife Catherine  in Ottawa in July 2011, and pictured right on their Diamond Jubilee tour of the Far East in 2012

The couple, pictured outside King Edward VII's Hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was admitted with severe morning sickness, have resisted hiring servants but that may change when their first baby is born
