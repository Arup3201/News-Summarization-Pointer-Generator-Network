A man nicknamed the ‘Alabama Teabagger’ pleaded guilty on Tuesday to two obscenity charges for rubbing his genitals on an unconscious fan of a rival college football team in a New Orleans restaurant in January.

Prosecutors reached a plea deal with Brian Downing, 33, of Smiths Station, Alabama, on the morning he was scheduled to be tried on charges that included sexual battery, which is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.

While the battery charge has been dropped, Downing is still facing prison time for the obscenity charges.

Arrested: Brian Downing, was booked on charges of sexual battery and obscenit after being videotaped 'placing his genitals on an LSU fan's face'

Downing
 is scheduled to be formally sentenced on November 29, but Orleans 
Parish Criminal District Judge Karen Herman indicated she will sentence 
Downing to two years in prison and recommend his participation in a boot
 camp program run by prison officials.

The Alabama resident will not be required to register as a sex offender.

A
 video that went viral on the Internet appeared to show someone in a 
University of Alabama jacket exposing his genitals and performing a 
simulated sex act on the unconscious man at the Bourbon Street 
restaurant after the Crimson Tide beat LSU for the BCS football 
championship on January 9.

The
 LSU fan has sued Downing, asking damages for ‘mental anguish, 
humiliation, embarrassment, anxiety and depression ... damage to 
reputation’ and lost tuition payments ‘for having to withdraw from 
school.’

Christopher 
Bowman, spokesman for District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro, said 
prosecutors consulted with the victim before agreeing on the plea deal.

He
 described it as the ‘most just outcome and also the most certain 
outcome.’ He rejected the notion that Downing's actions were merely a 
drunken prank.

‘When you 
put your genitals on someone's body, someone who is passed out, that's 
not a prank,’ he said. ‘I don't think people would be asking that 
question if the defendant had done it to a passed-out woman.’

Michael
 Kennedy, one of Downing's attorneys, said his client decided to accept 
the deal in large part because he has a one-year-old son and didn't want
 to have to register as a sex offender.

‘Is
 it worth the risk of never seeing a Little League game? Of never being 
able to drop your child off at school? He decided no,’ Kennedy said.

Although
 Downing will be sentenced to two years, he may be eligible to serve 
less than half of that. Kennedy estimated his client will serve a 
minimum of nine months.

Downing didn't answer a reporter's questions after the brief hearing. He walked out of the courtroom in silence, surrounded by his family and legal team.

Captured: Downing is a second cousin of Russell County, Ala., Sheriff Heath Taylor, who said that he learned from other family members Thursday morning that Downing had been identified in the video and called his father to bring him down to the station

The footage of the January 9 was uploaded to the Alabama University sports channel 
BamaSportsForum on YouTube - and promptly deleted after it swept the 
Internet.

Police said sex crimes detectives met
 Downing at his attorney's office in New Orleans, where officers 
arrested him.

Downing looked at the ground as officers escorted him in 
handcuffs into the jail. Neither he nor the officers answered questions.

Police said LSU and Alabama University campus police helped them collect 
information and evidence needed to get a warrant for Downing's arrest.

Downing is a second cousin of Russell County, Alabama, Sheriff Heath 
Taylor who turned him in.

Taylor said that when he heard the allegation from his family that he had no choice but to 
arrest Downing or send him to New Orleans.

'I wasn't going to let 
anybody say that because he's my family I wasn't doing anything about 
it.

Mr Taylor said, he called Downing's dad 
and told him to bring him to the sheriff's office in Phoenix City, Alabama.

It wasn't a hard decision, he said. 'You've just got to do the right thing.'

Downing's actions were videotaped about 11.45pm January 9, at a fast food eatery on Bourbon Street, police said.

A video taken on a camera phone 
showed a group of students from Alabama University surround the 
Louisiana State University student who is slumped over a table passed 
out, at a Krystal restaurant in New Orleans on January.

The
 footage was uploaded to the Alabama University sports channel 
BamaSportsForum on YouTube - and promptly deleted. It shows a man climbing on top of the rival fan and rubbing 
his genitals repeatedly in his face.

The sexual assault happened 
following a game between the two colleges during the Bowl Championship 
Series where Alabama beat LSU 21-0.

The clip, which lasts for five 
minutes shows a group dressed in crimson Alabama shirts placing cartons 
on the young man's head while whooping and cheering, snapping pictures 
on their camera phones.

One voice, off camera, says: 'This guy's life is over.'

The hazing continues with rival fans 
sticking straws up the man's nose and leaning over him while football 
chants echo around the fast food joint, where hundreds of fans have 
gathered.

Another man adds: 'Seriously, I don't see him moving' before adding, 'someone has to pour water on him.'

The man shifts slightly in the seat with his head slumped on the table but remains unconscious.

It is then that a rival fan, dressed 
in a baseball cap, red hoodie and khaki shorts pulls his genitals out of
 his pants and climbs over the other man, grinding into face.

Scott Myers, a spokesman for Birmingham, Alabama-based Hibbett Sports Inc.,
 confirmed Thursday that the company fired Downing because 
of his part in the video.

He said the company had been aware of the tape but did not identify the 
person on it until Wednesday. He refused to say what the man did for 
Hibbett or how the company became aware of his alleged involvement. 
Hibbett Sports lists about 800 stores in 26 states.

'We were made aware of this situation late yesterday afternoon. We 
conducted our own investigation, and after the investigation was 
concluded, we made the determination to terminate his employment,' Myers
 said.

Two students in the clip have been identified by Deadspin.com - Patrick Setterstrom and his blonde girlfriend Ellen
 Cassin. He appears to attempt to expose himself at the start of the 
video before his girlfriend restrains him. Since the clip appeared both 
have deleted their Facebook profiles.

The
 recent college graduate is the son of Alabama's WKRG TV station's 
sports director Randy Patrick Setterstrom. The station admitted that it 
was their director's 22-year-old son.

Remi Braden, director of public 
affairs at New Orleans Police Department, told MailOnline: 'We were 
alerted to the video last Sunday and immediately started a preliminary 
investigation. 

'No one in the restaurant where the 
incident occurred contacted police but the investigation is ongoing. 
Because this is a possible sexual battery case, we are not in a position
 to release more information at this time.'

The victim may not necessarily have to come forward as charges can be brought in the name of the state.

However, Ric Simmons, a criminal law professor at the Ohio State University Moritz College of Law, points out that this is a far from a straightforward case.

He told MailOnline: 'Technically a prosecutor does not need a victim to prosecute a crime, as long as there is other evidence sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

'But although it is possible to obtain a conviction in a case like this without a victim, it will be difficult to do so. A jury may not take the case very seriously if there is no victim willing to testify.

'In this case, as reprehensible as the conduct may appear to some, others may see it as merely a crude college prank which does not rise to the level of criminal behavior. 

'That perspective will only be reinforced if the victim does not care enough about the case to come forward.  Given this challenge, a prosecutor’s office may be reluctant to commit their scarce resources to prosecuting such a case.'

Professor Simmons teaches criminal law at Ohio State. Prior to becoming a law professor, he was an assistant district attorney for New York County.
