After his golden season, Mike Brown is experiencing the flip-side of acclaim and recognition. He is striving to live up to that sustained near-perfection and finding it frustrating.

Raised and distorted expectations are the issue for Harlequins’ England full back, who believes that his game continues to improve. The peaks of 2013-14 featured endless tries and awards and fanfare for his work in the England No 15 shirt he had always craved.

The 29-year-old became seemingly untouchable as the national team’s last line of defence.

He was named Aviva Premiership Player of the Year, England’s player of the QBE autumn series and Six Nations Player of the Championship. He was identified by the All Blacks as the key threat to their home rule last June.

But this season, Brown has not been feted in the same way. With Quins blowing hot and cold and England stumbling through their November campaign, his every isolated error has been identified as proof that the spell has been broken. He can sense murmurs of doubt, but points to a shift in his job description and his profile, which has diminished his freedom to run amok.

‘I’m pretty happy with how I’m playing,’ he said. ‘I think my game is a lot more rounded than it was last year and I have a different role this season, especially with Quins. I’ve been playing more as a distributor — putting others into gaps, which is frustrating at times because my strength is my running game. I’ve been doing more kicking, too.

‘I feel like more of a marked man this year, but that creates more space for other people. As long as I’m making the correct decisions about when to pass and when to run, that’s good. I think I’m still playing at that same high level; it’s just that people focus on the flashy stuff.

‘People expect me to be making those long breaks and scoring tries in every game now, but there’s so much more to rugby. I’m working hard and improving in other areas. If I wasn’t, I certainly wouldn’t be starting England games.’

Brown has all the self-belief associated with a run of 17 consecutive starts at full back for England, after spending time filling in on the wing. Nevertheless, he is alert to speculation about selection, with Alex Goode of Saracens continuing to pressurise him and many observers championing Ben Foden until he suffered a season-ending knee injury.

‘Once a player gets to a certain level and gets talked up, there’s always going to be chat about how they are performing,’ said Brown. ‘Look at Chris Robshaw and how often he gets it — about who should be playing instead of him. Then he puts in another top performance.

‘It creates a debate, but I can’t really look at that. I just have to get on with it.’

Having spent so many years striving for his Test breakthrough, Brown has no intention of tamely allowing a challenger to usurp him — particularly in this momentous year of a home World Cup.

‘There’s no way I’m going to take my foot off the gas now,’ he said. ‘It’s such an important year and hopefully I keep getting selected. I’m trying to show that my game is more rounded, even if some people don’t want to see it! I’m sure the coaches recognise what I’m doing.’

When he is back on England duty again next week, the focus will be to prepare for a return to Cardiff, where a Grand Slam crusade was buried under an avalanche of Welsh points in the record 30-3 defeat two years ago.

Brown recalls the fervent atmosphere in the Millennium Stadium that day and the fact that England were in the hunt for longer than the scoreline suggests.

Lancaster’s men have finished runners-up in the Six Nations for the last three seasons and as the arch-competitor, Brown won’t settle for that. ‘We’re an ambitious squad and we want to win it this year,’ he said.

On Saturday, Brown will hope that he and the rest of Harlequins’ international contingent can lead the way in putting Castres to the sword in France, in the faint hope that it will lead to a place in the last eight of the European Champions Cup.

He will be desperate to come through unscathed, to resume his attempts to live up to heightened expectations, in the national cause.
