After four months of being separated from their wives and families to serve their country in Afghanistan, their return home was always going to be an emotional reunion. 

And these heartwarming pictures have captured the special moment a six-year-old boy's face lights up with pure delight as he watches his father arrive back in the UK.

Kieran, who dressed up in a full RAF suit adorned with his father's medals, first breaks into a beaming smile before running in to the arms of his father, Sergeant Chris Everett, as he steps off a plane at RAF Marham, Norfolk.

Heartwarming: Both father and son break out into huge smiles as they are reunited after four months apart

After giving his father a big hug, Kieran said: 'I drew daddy a picture saying 
welcome home because I missed him a lot. When he was coming home I 
wanted to give him a big kiss.'

Sergeant Everett was also welcomed home by his wife Carly and their four-year-old daughter Kyara.

He was one of 200 RAF personnel returning home from a four month posting in Afghanistan.

The airmen and women from II (AC) Squadron were hugged and kissed by their children, partners, wives and husbands after touching down at their base.

The hundreds of well-wishers cheered and waved banners to greet their loved ones from the unit which celebrated its centenary this year and is the RAF’s oldest flying squadron.

Mike Jeffrey was welcomed back by his son Joshua, who was celebrating his third birthday.

He said: 'I can’t even begin to put it into words.

'You’re there for such a long time and to get off that plane and see their smiling faces waiting - it’s just incredible.'

Vito Reale, 30, said: 'Finally, after four months, I’m back where I belong, with my family and my fiancee, it’s surreal but so great to be here.'

Wing Commander Nick Tucker-Lowe, the commander of the Tornado squadron, said: 'It’s been a wonderfully warm welcome back.

'Throughout our deployment the support we’ve had from our families, friends and the people of Norfolk has been second to none, so it’s great to see such a wonderful turnout today.

'This has been a tremendously successful deployment, we have seen how the Tornado is still held in high regard and used across the whole of Afghanistan.

'I’m looking forward to having a break, to being a dad and a husband again.'
