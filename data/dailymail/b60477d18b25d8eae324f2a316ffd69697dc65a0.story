The taxpayer has paid more than £2million buying smartphones and iPads for bureaucrats in NHS quangos, it can be revealed.

Thousands of iPhones and tablet computers have been bought for staff at NHS England and Public Health England, set up under the coalition's reforms to save money for the health service.

The government insisted it helped staff work more flexibly, but the expensive gadgets are all for managers and not doctors and nurses.

Since Jeremy Hunt became Health Secretary, his department and NHS quangos have spent tens of thousands of pounds on Apple iPhones and iPads, it has emerged

New details of spending on technology emerged in response to a parliamentary question by shadow public health minister Luciana Berger.

Data released by health minister Dan Poulter shows that NHS England and Public Health England, both formed last year, were the biggest spenders on iPads and iPhones.

NHS England bought 115 iPads and 400 iPhones in the year before it was officially launched in April 2013, and since then has bought another 150 iPads and 1,900 ipads. The quango's total bill comes to £1.2million.

Public Health England, also formed last year, has spent a total of £530,000 on 2,036 iPhones and £113,743 on 65 iPads.

The Department of Health itself, which is run by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, has spent almost £40,000 on four iPhones and 95 iPads.

The Health & Social Care Information Centre, which collects and analyses NHS patient data, has bought five iPads and 186 iPhones, costing a total of £45,875.

The Care Quality Commission, which inspects care homes and hospitals, bought 238 iPads and two iPhones, costing £129,122.

And the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which rules on spending on drugs, spent £3,717 on nine iPads and an iPhone.

Karl Turner MP said: 'At a time when the NHS is in crisis, out-of-touch Tory ministers are splashing more than £2 million on iPhones and iPads for pen-pushers.

'Labour is promising an extra £2.5 billion beyond Tory plans – which will be spent on patients, not office perks.'

NHS England and Public Health England, both set up last year under the coalition's NHS reorganisation, have spent the most on iPads and iPhones

The government has been repeatedly criticised for the controversial reorganisation of the NHS, which saw Primary Care Trusts abolished and a new network of quangos and clinical bodies set up instead.

The changes were designed to reduce the number of managers and put decision-making in the hands of doctors. 

Insiders have described the reforms as 'unintelligible gobbledygook' which had been a 'huge strategic error' for the Conservative's reputation for looking after the health service.   

The controversial shake-up, which was not included in either Coalition party's manifesto, was drawn up by Andrew Lansley, when he was the health secretary.

It was originally claimed it would save £7.7billion, but it was later downgraded to £6billion. 

A Department of Health spokesman said: 'Employers across the world are embracing 21st Century technology such as smartphones and tablets because they allow staff to be more flexible and efficient, and in the case of the public sector provide better value for money for taxpayers. 

"Our bureaucracy-busting reforms to the NHS are saving £1.5billion a year. There are also over 13,500 more frontline staff and 7,000 fewer managers in the NHS since May 2010.' 

Critics have complained that managers given pay-offs after health bodies were axed were quickly rehired by new NHS groups.

Yesterday the Treasury announced redundancy payouts given to NHS managers are to be clawed back if workers get a new job in the health service.

Ministers vowed to end the revolving door of highly-paid administrators handed golden goodbyes worth thousands of pounds before walking straight into another role.

But the move was dismissed as 'too little, too late' after 4,000 have already been rehired and it emerged staff will be able to keep the cash if they wait for a year before taking up a new post.
