Being a foreign minister certainly has its perks.

But while Julie Bishop currently holds one of the top Australian ministerial jobs - quite possibly one of the most enviable - she's also had her fair share of black lash over the last few months.

She's also revealed in an interview published on Saturday that the job certainly isn't as glamorous as it seems, albeit the jet-setter lifestyle. And counting the calories is the least of her concerns.

Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop reveals that she simply 'keeps fit' to help balance her jet-setter lifestyle

The 57-year-old has been receiving backlash from angry protestors over the last few months

'I keep fit,' she told The Age when asked how she maintains a balance.

'And no, I'm not keeping a diary. No, I'm not obsessed about my body, my weight, my face, my abs.'

It's clear that Bishop has better things to do with her time.

Adorning her desk is her treasured happy snaps with US president Barack Obama and United Nations secretary-general Ban Ki Moon.

But the 57-year-old, who's also the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia, is no stranger to confrontation having been targeted by protestors over the last few months.

An anti-government protester lunged at the foreign minister's car as she left a C20 summit in Melbourne on June 20, after giving a keynote speech about concerns regarding job losses and university fees.

Bishop was also targeted by protesters at Sydney University in May.

More recently, about 200 students angered by the federal government's cuts to education also protested at Bishop's Perth, Western Australia, office and had to be told to move on by police on Thursday.
