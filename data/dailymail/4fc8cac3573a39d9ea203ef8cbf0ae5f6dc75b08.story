Victim: PC Blakelock was hacked to death on Tottenham's Broadwater Farm Estate in 1985

A gang member paid £5,000 for his eye-witness account of Keith Blakelock’s murder told a court yesterday he kicked the officer ten times during the 1985 Tottenham riots.

The witness, giving evidence under the pseudonym John Brown, admitted being part of a gang that repeatedly kicked and stabbed the policeman as he lay on the ground.

PC Blakelock was stabbed 43 times by a baying mob shouting ‘kill the pig’ as he tried to protect firemen.

A knife was embedded in his neck in a failed attempt to decapitate him.

The officer ‘was trying to curl up into a ball’ in an attempt to protect himself and screamed ‘help, help, help’, said Mr Brown.

The witness’s role in the attack would usually mean he would be prosecuted for murder, the Old Bailey heard.

But he received immunity from prosecution, was paid £5,000 and was helped with his rent, phone and car bills after he assisted police in 1993 during a second investigation into PC Blakelock’s murder.

Giving evidence from behind a screen and with his voice distorted to protect his identity, Mr Brown said he saw Nicholas Jacobs stabbing the policeman with a machete during the riots.

Mr Brown, a former member of the mainly white Park Lane Boys gang, said: ‘I saw him hit a couple of blows on the officer in the shoulder. He was just stabbing up and down with the machete. I saw him do it between two and four times.’

He said he saw a sword, a 15in dagger and the machete allegedly wielded by Jacobs during the ‘frantic’ attack.

‘As he was brought to the ground I started kicking him. I kicked him in the ribs around ten times. I had trainers on,’ said Mr Brown.

Asked by prosecutor Richard Whittam QC why he kicked PC Blakelock, Mr Brown said: ‘I don’t know. I just rushed in. It was the excitement of the situation.

Tributes: Flowers left at the scene where PC Blakelock was hacked to death by dozens of men armed with everything from machetes to kitchen knives during riots at Broadwater Farm estate in 1985

'I noticed an officer being pulled to 
the ground by a couple of individuals. His helmet was knocked off. I 
didn’t see where it went. Then it was a free for all.

‘They were shouting things  like, “kill the beasty”, “kill the Babylon”, “get his f****** head on a pole” and “kill the pig”.’

Mr
 Brown, who was 20 at the time of the riots, described seeing one 
attacker with a long sword stabbing the top half of PC Blakelock’s body 
and another stabbing the officer with a short dagger twice in the ribs.

He told the jury he was carrying a stick on the night of the murder but had not used it.

After the riots Mr Brown pleaded guilty to affray and burglary and was jailed for five years, later cut to 42 months on appeal.

He
 gave evidence against Jacobs when he was tried for affray in 1986, 
placing him at the scene but making no mention  of the knife.

It was not until 1993 that Mr Brown claimed Jacobs attacked PC Blakelock with a machete.

Defence
 barrister Courtenay Griffiths QC accused Mr Brown of telling ‘blatant 
lies’ and ‘fitting up’ Jacobs so he could get a financial reward.

Mr
 Griffiths also accused him of colluding with his cousin and an old 
friend – two other key prosecution witnesses – to frame Jacobs. Mr Brown
 denied the allegations.

Jacobs, 45, of Hackney, East London, denies murder.

The trial continues.
