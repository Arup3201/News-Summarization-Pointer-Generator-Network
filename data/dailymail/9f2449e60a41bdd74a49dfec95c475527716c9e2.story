Britain's washout summer has been blamed on melting Arctic sea ice, as forecasters warned that the torrential downpours and thunder would continue for the rest of the month.

The soggiest June since records began has been followed by an equally miserable July, as parts of the UK experienced the average rainfall for the month in just
10 days.

Academics said that layers of melting sea ice across the Arctic Ocean are partly to blame for the relentless rain, as they've pushed cold plumes of air much further south than usual for this time of year.

The Arctic sea ice began melting at a 
rapid rate in line with the UK's run of dismal summers, leading many to 
question the effect of climate change on long-term weather patterns.

Despite the woeful conditions nationwide, however, many Britons soldiered on through the floods and showed admirable battling spirit.

In Croscombe, Somerset, two ice cream vans were spotted ploughing merrily through flood waters despite the small village being devastated by 3ft-deep swatches of floodwater.

The claims from academics came as the Met Office today gave a bleak outlook for the rest of the month, as more unsettled weather it predicted.

A spokesperson said that until the end of July there will be mostly unsettle patches of rainfall, interspersed only occasionally with sunshine.

Weather experts said up to 15mm of 
rain could fall in an hour in some places as the period of unseasonably 
wet weather that has brought flooding up and down the country continues.

The Environment Agency (EA) today has five 
flood warnings in place - three in the South West and two in the Midlands - and 26 
flood alerts in place across England.

Bleak: Forecasters have predicted that as well as widespread rain today, wet weather will last beyond Friday

London 2012 bosses making contingency plans for the wet weather have ordered 250,000 ponchos to hand out to spectators during the Games.

Olympic organisers made the move to battle the effects of downpours and thunderstorms on fans and athletes later this month.

Several of the events, including volleyball at Horse Guards Parade and eventing at Greenwich Park, are in temporary venues completely exposed to the elements.

The Olympic Stadium, meanwhile, is only two-thirds covered by a roof.

Even those who paid top prices for the best seats in the house could find themselves getting a soaking if the heavens open during the opening ceremony or during events.

Sports minister Hugh Robertson has said the government has been assured that most of the Olympic venues are 'reasonably waterproof'.

A LOCOG spokesperson told MailOnline: 'People in the UK are used to watching sport in good and bad weather.

'Wet weather clothing will be available for spectators to buy if they come unprepared.'

The Met Office today joined university academics in citing melting sea ice as a possible factor affecting Britain's weather.

Dan Williams, Met Office spokesperson,
said that although they are mainly attributing the rain to 'natural 
variability', sea ice being at record low levels for this time of year 
was also affecting weather patterns.

Jet streams of fast-moving wind have also been blamed for the constant downpours, causing the blankets of low pressure which lead to rain.

Matt Dobson, forecaster at MeteoGroup, said earlier this week: 'Our weather is really stuck in a rut because the jet stream is further south than it should be at this time of the year – over France and northern Spain – and we are under a blanket of low pressure on the northern side of it.

Mr Dobson said that heavy rain will also sweep through the UK from the south west on Thursday.

Large parts of the region were already battling horrendous conditions, including the residents of Croscombe, where 3ft of water submerged the centre of the small Somerset village.

Further north, places like Hebden Bridge in Yorkshire, which has already been pounded by relentless flooding, continue to struggle under the deluge of water.

While the Met Office has issued an 
amber warning of rain for south-eastern areas of Scotland and yellow 
warnings across large swathes of southern and northern England.

A spokesman said: 'The public should be prepared for the likelihood of localised flooding, particularly in the amber area.'

Gemma
Plumb, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, warned that bursts of torrential 
rain could fall on already saturated ground, increasing the chances of 
flooding.

She said: 'Scotland and northern England 
will see spells of heavy, persistent rain today and there are 
indications that there could be some torrential, thundery outbreaks.

'Elsewhere there will be showers, which could be persistent and heavy in some areas especially across southern and easterly parts of England.'

Forecasters predicted rainfall totals of around 20-30mm, but said double that amount could fall in local areas.

Ms Plumb said a further band of heavy, persistent rain will move in from the South West during tomorrow, increasing the flooding threat. More showers are expected in England and Wales on Friday.

'The rain is falling on already saturated ground and river catchments are already at very high levels so further problems are to be expected,' she added. Sunday could provide some respite from the rain with drier spells forecast.

Showers hit most parts of the UK 
yesterday, causing problems to the transport network and public events, 
including the England cricket match in Manchester.

The A35 in Dorset, which was shut due to flooding, remained closed in both directions between the A37 and A3066 this morning.

One of the country's largest agricultural shows was also cancelled after just a day because of the appalling weather.

The
annual Great Yorkshire Show in Harrogate began yesterday and was due to
run until tomorrow but organisers decided to pull the plug last night.

British winemakers are bracing themselves for a poor crop as the washout summer has decimated flowering vines.

Sussex was faced with 141mm of rain during the wettest June on record and winemakers are concerned for this year's harvest.

Vines flower before turning into fruit, which ripens before being harvested in October.

But this year's flowering season has been delayed due to heavy rain, and the Met Office is forecasting continued bad weather next week during a crucial period for winemaking.

Roy Cook, who runs Sedlescombe Organic Wines in Robertsbridge, East Sussex, said: 'If it rains a lot during this period we end up with a poor fruit.

'The flowers will just not turn to fruit. Some varieties are more prone than others but it means the yield will be much reduced - the total could be just a tenth of what it could be in a good year.

'You have a decreased quantity to sell and it does cause problems with cash flow.'

Peter Hall has run Breaky Bottom Vineyard near Lewes, East Sussex, for 38 years.

He said: 'I've had at least 34 cropping years and it would be foolish to deny this will not be one of the more difficult ones.

'I am nervous for the wellbeing of the national crop. This year is unlikely to produce a yield equal to previous ones.

In 2011 a hard winter, mild spring and late heatwave helped to produce three million bottles of English wine but next year's vintage is expected to be substantially lower.

Julia Trustam Eve spokesman for English Wine Producers said: 'For the next ten days or so wine producers will have to keep an eye out.

'It's still early days and there won't be too many people willing to make a call on what will happen just yet.'
