A young British tourist is recovering in a Thai hospital after being repeatedly stabbed by a mob as he tried to save his girlfriend from a pack sex attack.

Jack Cole, 21, from Bath was stabbed in the face and body after the laughing youths grabbed his 21-year-old girlfriend April Clifton as they enjoyed a romantic stroll towards a boat pier in Ao Nang, in southern Thailand.

After jumping to April's defence Jack was left to die in a pool of blood as the armed thugs fled.

She was also left bruised and battered when the motorcycle gang grabbed her, clawing at her clothes.

Surprise attack: The young couple, both 21 were enjoying a romantic stroll towards a boat pier in Ao Nang, in southern Thailand, when a group of Thai youths on motorcycles pounced from the shadows

Luckily a passing British tourist heard Jack's cries for help and called paramedics to the idyllic beach resort.

Jack said from the Bangkok-Phuket hospital yesterday: 'It was a calculated attack.

'They drove past us several times checking us out. We thought they had 
gone but they came out of the shadows and attacked April.

'They
 laughed as they grabbed April as a mob.

'There were seven of them.  Four
 men and three girls.

'I knocked the guy down who had grabbed April and 
then they crowded around me and I thought they were punching me.

'But
 it seems every punch was a stab. They were shouting in English ‘Come 
on. Come on’. I saw that April had managed to run away to the safety of a
 local Dive Shop and I fell to the ground as the group ran away 
laughing.

'I managed to stagger up to a foreigner whom I begged for help and people came to staunch the flow of blood.

'There
 was no reason for the attack. We had never seen these people before. 
They appeared to be driving in a gang looking for foreign victims. They 
made no attempt to take my wallet. They were just interested in April.'

The unnamed Briton, who runs the dive shop, has posted on an expat forum in Thailand.

Trauma: Jack said the youths were not interested in his wallet, just April. She is now too scared to go out alone while Jack recovers from his wounds in hospital

He
 said:  'In Ao Nang. I fear that another tourist death is imminent. 
Gangs of teenage kids, armed with knifes and machetes roam the roads 
like something out of a Hollywood horror movie. WTF is wrong with this 
place!'

He added: 'I accompanied them to the Krabi hospital where I witnessed the same old story. You pay or no treatment.

'The resort where they were staying kindly brought his and hers passports, money and the lifesaving Insurance'.

Idyllic: The couple had been staying at the luxury Centara Grand Beach Resort Hotel on Phra Nang Beach when the attack took place. Ao Nang has been the scene of several attacks on tourists this year

Yesterday three of the seven suspects were
 being held by Krabi Provincial Police. Another four are being sought 
from the Nong Talay area of Krabi.

Jack,
 who has been treated for stab wounds to his face, arms, chest and legs 
works for the Office Angels company in Bath as a recruitment officer. 
April has finished her studies and planned to seek work after returning 
from their dream holiday.

Both had been staying at the luxury 
Centara Grand Beach Resort Hotel and were walking to the Nopprarat Thara
 pier to catch a speedboat to their resort in neighbouring Plai Plong 
Bay.

April’s father has 
flown out to be with his daughter, who Jack says is scared to go out 
alone. The British Embassy has confirmed it is providing full consular 
assistance through their office in Phuket.

Ao Nang has been the scene of several attacks on tourists this year.

Three
 months ago a 19-year-old Dutch model was raped there. Police arrested 
her alleged attacker, but he was given bail immediately.

The girl's Dutch father subsequently posted a music video entitled 'Evil Man of Krabi' attacking the Thai justice system.

Resort: Nearby Ao Nang beach is very popular with holidaymakers
