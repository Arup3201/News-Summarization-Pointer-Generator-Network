There are plenty of Hollywood actors who would fancy themselves in the ring - Jean-Claude Van Damme, Jet Li, The Rock to name just a few - but according to UFC star Cung Le, none would be as effective in MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) as Channing Tatum.

The two have trained together before and  Le, an action film star himself, is impressed with his friend's natural ability, who is best known by many for his comedic roles in the 21 Jump Street series.

'Channing would actually have the best chance out there of anyone else,' Le told FOX Sports.

'He's strong, he's physical and he's not scared at all,' said Le, who worked with Tatum in the 2009 movie Fighting. 'If he would dedicate as much time as he did in the movies [to MMA], he would do fine.'

When Tatum was filming Foxcatcher, which will premiere in November, Le drilled wrestling with him, and although the actor struggled at times, Le was impressed.

Relentless: Channing Tatum impressed Cung Le with his energy and attitude towards fighting 

Brutal: Le has established himself as one of the stars of UFC and takes no prisoners in the ring 

No contest: Le thinks Channing Tatum has more of what it takes to be a fighter than Jean-Claude Van Damme 

'All you have to do is carry yourself like a wrestler, look like a wrestler and do takedowns and shoots like a wrestler,' Le told him. 'He didn't need to do all that.'

Le trained Tatum in different techniques for two hours and said that by the end, most people watching would have thought Tatum had a wrestling background.

'It was just all drilling for two hours and he looked the part,' Le said. 'Not anyone can do that in that quick a time.'

Take that! Le is put through his paces as he delivers a high kick as part of his training routine  

As for Van Damme, Le starred with him in the 2012 flick Dragon Eyes and, after sparring with him, didn't come away thinking that the Belgian could cut it in the UFC.

'His technique is very clean, very sharp,' Le said. 'He's a good martial artist… there's a new breed these days. MMA fighters are top of the food chain. Some of them might not punch and kick as pretty as Van Damme, but it's a different level.' 

Tatum will be in Macao next week for Le's UFC fight against Michael Bisping.
