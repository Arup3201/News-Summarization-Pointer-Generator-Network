A woman shopkeeper has been caught on CCTV fighting off an armed raider who pointed a loaded sawn-off shotgun at her seven-year-old daughter.

Ranvir Bassi, 35, who was in the family-run shop in Stafford with her young daughter Satpreet, can be seen grabbing the barrel of the gun and forcefully shoving the hooded robber away.

The shop's CCTV cameras then film the man running from the shop empty-handed - chased by the petite mother-of-two.

Mrs Bassi said her mother’s instinct took over as she fought to protect her daughter.

Mrs Bassi -  who is just 5ft 2in and weighs 9st - said: 'It was just 
horrific. I was shutting down the shop and he just burst in waving the 
gun around.

'He started shouting "Give me the money" and swearing at me.

'I
 really don’t know why I did it, but I guess my mother’s instinct took 
over, my daughter Sattreet was hiding and I just grabbed the gun.

'He had shouted at me to give him the money and I just shouted "Get out of my shop" - and started shoving him.

'I must have startled him because he turned and ran out of the shop.

'He just picked the wrong day to mess with me - I wasn’t having him take my hard earned cash.'

Mrs Bassi said her mother's instinct took over as she fought to protect her daughter

The family have run the store for 19 years but insist they will not be forced out by the incident

She said the incident had badly affected her daughter, who suffered from nightmares and flashbacks.

Her husband Parmjit, 32, was at home at the time of the attack, and she says they have all been left shocked by what happened.

The family have run the store for 19 years but insist they will not be forced out by the incident.

She added: 'We will not be moved - we are a close-knit community and we won’t be driven out by thugs like him.'

A 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named, was later caught by police after officers found his trainers close to the scene and the gun discarded by old bike frames nearby.

On Friday the teenager admitted attempted robbery, possessing a firearm with intent to commit robbery and possessing a prohibited weapon. 

Recorder Mr Michael Elsom told Stafford Crown Court: 'Mrs Bassi displayed quite extraordinary bravery in taking hold of the weapon.'

Prosecuting Phillip Beardwell said the gun’s stock had been crudely cut down, the barrel shortened and loaded with a 12-bore round.

He told the court the defendant had put forward a basis of plea in which he maintained he had been under pressure from others to commit the robbery.

Mr Beardwell added: 'At the time he was associating with people who were on the periphery of a local organised crime group.

'The Crown’s view is this was either braggadocio to earn his stripes, or it was something done under direction.

'The evidence is he attended the store alone and he left the store alone.'

Michael Anning, defending, added: 'This is not a determined and experienced criminal.

'He was under pressure in relation to a debt they said he owed. The gun was given to him by them to commit this offence.'

The case was adjourned and the teenager will be sentenced at a later date at the same court.
