Suspect: Nelson Delgado, 25, from Portugal, was held by police after a knifeman went on the rampage outside a club in the party resort of Magaluf

A Portuguese man has been accused of stabbing three Britons and a Spaniard in a Spanish holiday resort after a fight in a nightclub turned into a mass street brawl.

Nelson Delgado, 25, from Portugal, was held by police after a knifeman went on the rampage outside a pub in the party resort of Magaluf.

He has been remanded in custody after appearing in court.

Two of the injured Brits remained in a serious condition in hospital today with stab wounds to their back and abdomen.

They are currently in the island's Son Espase and Son Llatzer hospitals.

The stabbing happened around 4am on Friday morning, and more than 20 Britons working in the resort were said to have been involved in the brawl.

Police believe he mistook his alleged victims for a gang of partygoers wearing Halloween fancy dress who had assaulted his brother hours earlier.

Delgado, thought to have grown up in Britain, kept his head bowed as he was led into court by police for a private hearing on Saturday where he was told he was being probed on suspicion of attempted murder.

He has not yet been charged with any crime.

Magaluf is one of Europe's most popular holiday destination for young Britons, but has been tainted with tragedy in recent years.

In 2008 a British bar worker was raped, beaten and stabbed after walking home from work and three months ago Thomas Ousby fell to his death from the ninth floor of his hotel.

Toxicology tests found no drugs and barely any alcohol in his body and mystery surrounds what he was doing at the hotel and why he was found without shoes, wallet or phone.

Tom, an aspiring model and musician from Uxbridge, west London, was said to have ignored a warning from a maintenance man who told him to get down from the outside fire escape of the four-star hotel.

He then slipped and fell more than 60ft, landing on a wall. Staff said they had seen him running away from someone shortly before the tragedy.

His father John, 49, said: 'If there was foul play we want to know about it. We owe it to Tom. Whether he was chased is crucial to knowing what happened.

'If something happened and made him panic and try to get away - could someone have potentially met TomÂ  at the top of the roof or the stairs.?'
