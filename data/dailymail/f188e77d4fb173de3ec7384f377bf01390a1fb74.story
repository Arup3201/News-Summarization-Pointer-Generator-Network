A Pennsylvania high school student is expected to file a lawsuit against his school district after he was allegedly sexually assaulted by his former teacher.

A March 21 letter from the student's attorney, Susan L. Luckenbill, to Wyoming Valley West School District Superintendent Charles Suppon was obtained by The Citizens' Voice through an open records request.

The student's name as well as those of his parents were redacted by the district.

The student 'is a victim of sexual assault and was a minor at the time of the assault,' the letter alleges. It also claims that the student suffered 'damages and injuries' due to negligence from district employees and former teacher Lauren Harrington-Coooper, 31, 'on or about October 2013 through December 2013.'

On December 19, the Voice reports Harrington-Cooper, 31, was charged with having sexual intercourse twice and oral sex three times with an 18-year-old student one week in mid-December.

The 18-year-old student's sister told him that Harrington-Cooper texted her that her brother was 'hot,' according to the complaint obtained by the paper. The victim got Harrington-Cooper's cell phone number from his sister and reportedly texted her later that day.

On January 9, Harrington-Cooper was also charged with having oral sex in a parked car with a 17-year-old student in November.

Her relationship with that student began when she told a female student that the boy was attractive, the paper reports. The male student left her a note with his cell phone number and she allegedly sent him sexually explicit text messages.

On January 28, Harrington-Cooper was charged a third time for making inappropriate contact with two other male 
students, who were 16 and 17 at the time of the alleged crimes. Those relationships reportedly began in October 2012 and continued after her arrest, the paper reports.

Harrington-Cooper and the 17-year-old student met in a shopping center where they kissed and fondled each other in a car, according to an earlier report. The boy reportedly said he felt uncomfortable because they were not in a private area.

The 16-year-old boy said Harrington-Cooper was his teacher in both seventh and eleventh grades, and that he was 'trying to make it happen' for the 17-year-old student.

The 16-year-old also reportedly told authorities that there was a 'certain vibe' in his text message conversations with Harrington-Cooper and that he could have had sex with her anytime he wanted.

When he was a junior, Harrington-Cooper reportedly invited him to her house multiple times and showed him a tattoo of butterfly on her right breast.

Harrington-Cooper allegedly told the 16-year-old student about problems within her marriage and that if she and the student lived together 'they would have fun.'

Harrington-Cooper waived her right to a preliminary hearing on Thursday. On January 22, the school board had accepted her resignation from her post. She is free on $50,000 bail, the paper reports.

MailOnline earlier reported that Harrington-Cooper is married to Raphael Cooper, owner of Cooper Dance Academy.

On December 19, Raphael Cooper he told the school's students and their parents that classes were cancelled due to 'a family emergency' via Facebook.

Later that evening, he wrote: 'After the holiday, I, Raphael Cooper will address all of the members of our studio as to our future. Please keep everyone in our family in your prayers as we confront the days ahead.'
