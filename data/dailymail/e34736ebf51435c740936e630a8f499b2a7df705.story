Police arrested the driver of a 44-tonne car transporter for drink-driving - and found he had a stash of 60 cans of lager and two bottles of wine in his cab.

Karl Doyley, 44, 'stank of booze' when he arrived at a car dealership in Derby to drop off six cars.

Tests revealed the trucker - who was about to drive on another 30 miles - was almost three times the drink-drive limit.

Drunk at the wheel: Karl Doyley, 44, 'stank of booze' when he arrived at TC Harrison in Derby driving a 44-tonne transporter like the one pictured left

Police arrested him at the scene and stopped him taking his 22ft long transporter on to Chesterfield, Derbyshire.

Officers asked Doyley to take a breathalyser test which found he had 95mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath.

A second test in custody, taken around an hour later, found the reading was even higher at 99mg. The legal limit is 35mg.

A worker at the TC Harrison Ford garage in Derby said the driver arrived at their Pride Park dealership at around 6pm on March 27.

He said: 'Once it was clear that he was drunk and then told us he was going on to Chesterfield to deliver more cars after he left Derby I knew I had to act.

'There was no way I was going to let him back on the road and possibly kill someone because of the drunken state he was in.

'I couldn't, and I don't think any right-minded person, could have that on their conscience.

'What made it more remarkable was that when the police arrived and he opened up the door of his cab there must have been 60 cans of lager in there and two bottles of wine.

Guilty: Doyley admitted drink driving when he appeared before magistrates at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court

'Some were empty and lying on the floor and some were in a refrigerator he had in his cab.

'This man had already said he had delivered cars and was then planning on driving another 30 miles or so in the state he was in. It beggars belief.'

At Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court, Doyley, of Banbury, Oxfordshire, pleaded guilty to drink-driving.

Magistrates disqualified him from driving for 26 months, gave him a community order to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.

They also told him to pay £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge.

He was offered a drink-driving awareness course to reduce his ban by six months.

Chief Inspector Steve Wilson, head of roads policing in Derbyshire, said: 'Without the diligence and the vigilance of the staff at TC Harrison this drink-driver could have got behind the wheel of his 44-tonne vehicle and put lives at risk.

'Their quick thinking has stopped what might have been an extremely dangerous situation whereby someone has got behind the wheel of a 22ft long lorry and carried on driving whilst in the intoxicated state they were in.

'It is always refreshing to see the positive attitudes people take against those who drink-drive.'
