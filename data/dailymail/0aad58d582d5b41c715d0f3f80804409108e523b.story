The ladies of Downton are known for enjoying afternoon tea but they might be shocked if this cake was served alongside their sandwiches. 

A baker has created a cake that spookily resembles Lady Violet, the Dowager Countess of Grantham, played by Dame Maggie Smith.

The creation was the brainchild of cake and chocolate artist Karen Portaleo, 50, who was asked to make it to celebrate the season five premiere of the ITV show in the U.S.

The cake resembling the Dowager Countess took pride of place at a launch party at The Fox Theatre, hosted by Georgia Public Broadcasting.

It took Karen 18 hours to create her culinary masterpiece. It is a vanilla cake with buttercream, with an Earl Grey Tea soak. 

A humorous video speeding up the baking and decorating process reveals how the cake was made.

Attention to detail: The Dowager Countess's hat is added as the cake creation continues

Shots of Karen at work are interspersed with scenes from Downton Abbey in which the characters are talking about making a cake.  

The video also features some of Lady Violet's best one liners as if she is talking about the cake's creation. 

'There comes a time when things are best left to the professionals,' she quips as the scene cuts back to Karen baking.

The finished cake was displayed at a premiere party to celebrate season five of Downton Abbey  in the U.S

The food artist said she had been asked to recreate Downton Abbey itself, aka Highclere Castle in Newbury, West Berkshire, but she preferred to immortalise her favourite character from the show in sponge instead.

She told Today.com: 'Buildings are my Kryptonite. To me, buildings are much harder than faces; buildings are nothing but mass. Faces and people are so much more interesting.'

She added on her Instagram that: 'The Countess was delicious,' and revealed Dame Smith herself was sent a picture of the cake.

Downton Abbey consultant, Alastair Bruce, sent the actress a photo after he attended the party and was amused by the tribute.

Karen explained: 'He said the cake is so very American, which I thought was hysterical. It is very American to create a human out of cake.'
