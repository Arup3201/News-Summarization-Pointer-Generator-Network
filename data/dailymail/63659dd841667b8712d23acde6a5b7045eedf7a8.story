Reboot and refresh: The new Fantastic Four - Season One title will be the first in a series to include modern touches in the 1960s comic

They were stories created in an era when phones were attached to hooks, faces were in books and the only tweets were the ones coming from birds in trees.

However the modern touches which are so commonplace in today's digital age are to make their debut - in Marvel Comics.

The Fantastic Four comic book, which was created in the 1960s, is the first to be modernised in a makeover promising to 'blow the cobwebs off a story that's decades old'.

Mobile phones, tablet PCs, the Internet and Twitter are all to feature in 'tweaked' versions of the classic comic in a bid by the publishers to connect younger generations with its 1960s titles.

The Fantastic Four is the story of a science genius, his girlfriend, her hot-shot brother and a football player-turned-accomplished pilot, who are exposed to cosmic rays in space and return to Earth with super powers.

The origin 
of the story is being updated this week in a sleeker tale dubbed 'Season One' 
with a more contemporary vibe, while sticking to the roots of Reed 
Richards, Sue Storm, brother Johnny, and Ben Grimm - who have otherwise been known for 
the past 51 years as Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, the Human Torch and
the Thing.

The revision is part of Marvel's push to add modern touches to its characters. Marvel also is bringing a modern spin to the origins of its other classic characters this year in similar 'Season One' editions, including Daredevil, Spider-Man and the X-Men.

Tom Breevort, who edits the publisher's Fantastic Four lines of books, said: 'The aim is definitely to continue to keep these characters relevant in an ever-changing world, but also to tell a new story set within this time frame, not merely recount or retell comics that other people have previously done.

'We tweaked elements where it made sense. Everybody in the `Season One' books has a cell phone, for example, but we tried to maintain the spirit of the seminal stories that these tales are built upon.'

Roberto Aquirre-Sacasa, a playwright 
and TV writer whose credits include 'Glee' along with several stories 
for Marvel, said 'Fantastic Four: Season One' was not a reboot of the 
classic origin, penned by Stan Lee and drawn by Jack Kirby.

What a Marvel: The comic book publisher is planning on giving some of its other titles a modern spin

He added: 'It's more of a ... refresh. The world's changed over the last 50 years. How we tell comic stories, how we absorb them, so let's update a great concept by setting it in the present. By giving it a contemporary sensibility.'

Artist David Marquez, whose first published comic work 'Syndrome' came out in 2010, likened it to reintroducing classic stories to modern audiences.

He said: 'The storytelling techniques we use as creators and the expectations of readers have changed since the FF's origins were first told.

'And because of this, it can be hard for 
people who didn't grow up accustomed to the Silver Age style to find 
these stories as exciting and inspiring as those of us who did.'

Aguirre-Sacasa said the idea is to 
make the characters more relevant to a reader who navigates social 
media, consumes information and is fluent in not just pop culture, but 
entertainment of all stripes.

He added: 'Another example, and it's just a little thing, but the Fantastic Four - after their ill-fated debut battling the Mole Man - are Internet sensations.

'And Johnny, annoyingly, is burning up Twitter. Again, it's little details like that, which don't alter the fundamental DNA of the Fantastic Four, but blow the cobwebs off a story that's decades old. And have a slightly more pop flavor.'

Ultimately, however, no matter the year - be it 1961 or 2012 - the objective is creating a fresh and invigorating story with characters that have been a bedrock for Marvel.

Marquez added: 'This was my first big project at Marvel, and it gave me a chance to draw characters I have been in love with since I first started reading comics as a kid.

'I really had to up my game to show everyone at Marvel that I could do justice to Roberto's script, not to mention the high bar set by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.'
