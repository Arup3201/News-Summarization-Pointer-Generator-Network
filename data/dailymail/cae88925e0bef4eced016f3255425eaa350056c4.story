The executive producer of Top Gear has apologised after the show's presenters got into hot water again with viewers - and this time for parking in disabled bays.

On Sunday night's episode Jeremy Clarkson and James May tried out electric cars by driving them 
to Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, where they pulled into a car park to 
discuss the merits of the motors.

But instead of using standard parking spaces, the road hogs parked in spaces for disabled bays.

Scandal: Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson and James May have driven into trouble yet again for parking in disabled bays during filming of the hit show

During the slot about electric cars, 
Jeremy Clarkson - driving a £31,000 Nissan Leaf - and James May - 
driving a £33,000 Peugeot iOn - discussed the merits of non-petrol cars,
asking 'should you buy an electric car?'

After
parking up in the disabled bays the pair laughed and joked about the 
costs of the cars and the electric motors - which are capable of a top 
speed of up to 90mph.

They also 
joked about the luggage space and how electric cars had to be fitted 
with special windscreen wipers which make barely any noise.

But it was only when they started to walk away did shocked viewers realised where the pair were parked.

Andy Wilman responded to complaints by penning an explanation on the show's blog.

He said the programme makers had permission to use the bays for 'a quiet spot to film in' and there were three other unused bays available all the time.

He pleaded with disgruntled viewers to vent their fury at producers, rather than the presenters who are renowned for making controversial remarks and pulling stunts.

Typical: Rather than parking in normal parking bays, Jeremy Clarkson and James May parked in spaces reserved for disabled people, sparking outrage among disability groups

'For those who are cross with us, please direct your anger towards myself and the production team, rather than at Jeremy and James,' he wrote.

'Both presenters expressed deep concern to the film crew and me about using the disabled bays prior to filming, because of the disrespectful impression it would convey.

'They only capitulated when we assured them the parking had been approved by the owner, and that the disabled bay markings would not appear on television.

'This was our fault, not theirs, and we unreservedly apologise to all the viewers we have upset as a consequence.'

It was the latest in a string of apologies the BBC have had to issue over the programme.

Controversial: It is just eight months since the team sparked a diplomatic incident by poking fun at Mexicans

Earlier this year, the BBC apologised to the Mexican ambassador over remarks made by Clarkson, May and co-host Richard Hammond.

In the episode, broadcast on January 30, Hammond joked that Mexican cars reflected national characteristics, saying they were 'just going to be lazy, feckless, flatulent oaf with a moustache, leaning against a fence asleep, looking at a cactus with a blanket with a hole in the middle on as a coat'.

May described Mexican food as 'like sick with cheese on it' and Clarkson predicted they would not get any complaints about the show because 'at the Mexican embassy, the ambassador is going to be sitting there with a remote control like this (snores). They won't complain, it's fine'.
