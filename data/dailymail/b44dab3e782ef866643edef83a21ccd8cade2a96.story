The US Coast Guard have released video of the minutes before and after police detained Jessica Smith, 40, who is accused of murdering her two-year-old daughter and critically injuring her 13-year-old daughter in Oregon last week.

Smith had been on the run for two days before police caught up with her after staff at the hotel she was staying at in Cannon Beach discovered her toddler, Isabella Smith and teenager, Alana Smith on Friday, August 1.

The footage shot from a Coast Guard MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter on Sunday shows that Smith was taken into custody without incident after crews spotted her Chevrolet Suburban 15 miles east of the Cannon Beach resort and directed officers to her hiding place.

During the course of the video, which shows Smith wandering through a heavily wooded area, one law enforcement officer is seen to wipe the nose of Smith, who is in handcuffs.

The pilot and crew first spotted Smith from 1,000 feet and were about to call of their search for the day when they caught glimpse of her car.

However, the crews noted that Smith seemed to be trying to get their attention and figured that she was ready to turn herself in after she waved to the helicopter with both arms.

An engineer in the helicopter wrote a note, 'Help is on the way' and put it into a plastic pouch attached to a weight and lowered it down to Smith according to Oregon Live.

Hands up: At one point, Smith openly waved her arms in the air as if to signal the helicopter to let them know where she was

'Once she read that, she sat down on the ground and stayed there,' Blair Petterson, a Coast Guard flight mechanic said to Oregon Live.

Then the helicopter crews directed police through the winding forested road to where Smith was.

Helicopter pilot, Lieutenant Commander Josh Nelson said that he was stunned they found her.

'Given the information we had, you're basically looking for a needle in a haystack,' said Nelson.

'It's amazing he was able to spot it,' Nelson said. 'Even after we knew where it was I had trouble keeping the car in sight.'

Apprehended: Jessica Smith with two law enforcement officials after being brought into their custody in Oregon on Sunday

On Sunday, Oregon police held a press conference to say that Smith was found at the end of a logging road off Highway 26. She did not appear armed or injured.

Jessica Smith, 40, of Goldendale, Washington, was ordered held without bail Monday during her first court hearing, in which she appeared via a video feed from jail.

Her lawyer, William Falls, declined to comment, except to say the case would be tried in the courtroom, not the media.

Authorities began looking for Smith on Friday after a housekeeper at the Surfsand Resort in Cannon Beach found the body of Smith's 2-year-old daughter in a room.

The other daughter, age 13, was badly cut and taken to a Portland hospital for surgery, police said. She's expected to recover.

On Sunday, a Coast Guard helicopter spotted an SUV driven by Smith in the woods east of Cannon Beach, and authorities soon took her into custody.

Found: Jessica Smith, 40, was arrested Sunday night for allegedly murdering her two-year-old daughter Isabella. She was found in her car at the end of a remote logging road, two days after her daughter's death

The mother had been under a court order to turn over the children to their father, Greg Smith, at 5 pm on Friday, the day the girls were found in the hotel room, The Oregonian reported.

An autopsy concluded the toddler's death was a homicide, although it didn't determine the precise cause. Investigators were awaiting toxicology reports.

Custody battle: Smith was in the process of a divorce and was supposed to be dropping her children off with her estranged husband the day she allegedly killed her two-year-old and attempted to kill her 11-year-old

Smith faces charges of aggravated murder, which could lead to the death penalty, and attempted aggravated murder.

At the hearing Monday, she sat at a table, said nothing and frequently looked down. She did not enter a plea, and her next court appearance is scheduled for August 12.

Smith checked into the Cannon Beach lodging Wednesday.

She and Greg Smith separated in April after 17 years of marriage, according to news reports. Greg Smith filed for divorce in June and sought shared custody of the children.

Court records show Greg Smith obtained a temporary court order that prevented Jessica Smith from taking their children from the Washington area, or the Portland-Vancouver area, The Oregonian reported.

Greg Smith's attorney, Nathan Petersen, told the newspaper a judge had ordered that Greg Smith be granted limited parenting rights starting August 1.

A parenting plan set out in court records shows he was to have the children from Friday evening through Sunday night every other weekend.

According to The Oregonian, Greg Smith in July received worrisome text and voice messages from Jessica Smith and the teenage daughter.

He requested that a psychologist conduct an evaluation of where the children should be placed.

Greg Smith wrote in court papers that the teen sounded in a voice message she left for him as though she was 'reading from something that Jessica scripted,' making statements like 'I'm so sick I can hardly talk,' and 'It's terrifying and cruel of you not to respect us.'

According to The Oregonian, the father wrote in the court records that he had a positive relationship with his daughters and did not understand "why Jessica is manipulating our children into believing otherwise."

On Sunday, Greg Smith's family released a statement through the FBI thanking law enforcement and others for their help.

'We are extremely grateful for the outpouring of sympathy and support from Cannon Beach and the surrounding communities,' the statement said.

Cannon Beach is a popular weekend getaway for people from the Portland region, about 80 miles away. It features galleries, shopping and scenic seascapes.
