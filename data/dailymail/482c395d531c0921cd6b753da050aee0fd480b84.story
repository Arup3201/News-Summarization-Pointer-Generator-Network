Police will speak to Roy Keane after he was involved in an alleged road-rage bust-up with a taxi driver.

The former Manchester United captain is said to have banged on the window of a cab, made obscene gestures and hurled a foul-mouthed tirade of abuse after clambering out of his Range Rover at traffic lights in Altrincham.

Keane, 43, is then reported to have got back into his vehicle and driven off, leaving the taxi driver stunned.

The cabbie then reported the matter to Greater Manchester Police who confirmed that they are investigating.

Shocked onlookers witnessed the alleged altercation near the Unicorn pub at the junction of Lloyd Street and Railway Street in Altrincham town centre, south of Manchester, at 11.30am on Friday.

Keane, who lives in nearby Hale, is said to have driven up the road behind the taxi before getting out at the lights

Keane left his role as Aston Villa's assistant manager earlier this season 

A GMP spokesman said: 'At 11.30am this morning, Friday 30 January 2015, police were called to Ashley Road, Altrincham to a report that a man had behaved aggressively towards another man.

'An investigation is underway to establish the exact circumstances surrounding the incident.'

Officers are expected to contact the Irishman for his version of events.
