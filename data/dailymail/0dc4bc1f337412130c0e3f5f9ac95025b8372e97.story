A Thai taxi driver has been charged with murder after allegedly hacking an American passenger to death who 'refused to pay a fare worth less than $2'.

CCTV caught part of the fatal row in Bangkok, and shows a man — later identified as 32-year-old cab driver Chidchai Utmacha — brandishing a long blade, authorities said.

Utmacha allegedly confessed to grabbing a 12-inch machete from his trunk and slashing Troy Lee Pilkington with it.

The driver claims that Californian-born Mr Pilkington lunged at him and he was forced to stab him with the machete in self defense

But he claims he acted in self-defense
after the American charged at him after allegedly refusing to pay a 51 
baht fee - $1.60 - for his ride.

Police Lt. Col. Teerayut Maiplaeng 
said Pilkington, 51, had been living in Thailand for at least three 
years and spoke Thai fluently, the NY Daily News reported.

Video footage from a surveillance camera captured part his ordeal, which took place Saturday on Bangkok's busy Sukhumvit Road.

The footage shows the taxi driver swinging a machete as a man, identified as Mr Pilkington, flails his arms and tries to grab the driver.

The two men then move out of the camera's view, and seconds later, the sword-wielding driver reappears in the frame as he flees the scene.

Mr Pilkington, worked for US machinery company Caterpillar Inc. and had lived in Thailand for at least three years.

The taxi driver  told investigators that Pilkington accused him of rigging the taxi's meter and then stormed out of the cab while they sat in traffic.

He claimed the American threw a cup of coffee at him when he asked for the money, after which he pulled the knife from his trunk and chased after Pilkington.

Police identified the driver from the video footage and arrested him at his house on Sunday.

Chidchai is facing charges of murder and carrying a weapon in public without reasonable cause.
