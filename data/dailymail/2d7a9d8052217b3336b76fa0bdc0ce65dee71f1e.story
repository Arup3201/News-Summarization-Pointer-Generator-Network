Death: PC Keith Blakelock was killed in 1985 in the Broadwater Farm disturbances in North London

Rioters passed a police helmet around ‘like a trophy’ after PC Keith Blakelock was killed in the Broadwater Farm disturbances in North London, a jury heard yesterday.

A key witness, known as Rhodes Levin to protect his identity, told the Old Bailey he saw Nicky Jacobs, 45, attacking the officer on the estate in Tottenham on October 6, 1985.

Levin, who himself admits kicking the police officer a few times, said he saw Jacobs kicking and punching Mr Blakelock during the onslaught.

He also claimed he saw the defendant, who denies murder, carrying a lock knife at the scene with a brown handle and blade of around six inches.

And he said that immediately afterwards Jacobs had told him that he had ‘got a couple of dukes in’ on the policeman.

Levin told the court at that point he saw a police helmet but could not remember who was holding it. ‘They were passing it around, showing it,’ he said. ‘It was like a trophy.’

The witness said that days after the attack he had met Jacobs, who again boasted of getting ‘a couple of stabs’ in on the officer.

Levin, who has convictions relating to Class A drugs, was sentenced for affray and handling stolen goods in relation to the riots, the court heard.

He was paid around £5,000 and given immunity from prosecution after providing information to a renewed investigation into PC Blakelock's killing in the 1990s.

Flashback: The riots occurred around the Broadwater Farm area of Tottenham, on October 6, 1985

Police approached him again in January 2008 and since then he has received money for a deposit on accommodation and expenses, the court heard.

The witness said that two or three months after he was interviewed by police in 1985 he had been assaulted at a party in Tottenham and warned not to get involved.

‘Somebody called me into the toilets and when I went into the toilets a couple of people blocked off the toilet door,’ he said. ‘One of the guys smashed a bottle over my head and I managed to struggle my way out of the door.’

Under cross-examination by Courtenay Griffiths QC, for the defence, Levin admitted that he and the prosecution's two other key witnesses had grown up together.

After being arrested in November 1985 he was kept in custody for five days without the assistance of a lawyer, the court heard.

During interviews with police he was assaulted and his testicles were squeezed on more than one occasion, he said.

But Levin denied that officers had suggested names that they wanted him to ‘put in the frame’.

During the interviews he told police that Winston Silcott had been orchestrating the attack on PC Blakelock and was the only one he saw with a ‘large machete’ - a claim he now admits was a lie.

Mr Silcott went on to become one of three men who had their 1987 convictions for allegedly murdering the officer quashed in 1991.

Tributes: Flowers left at the scene where PC Blakelock was killed during riots at the Broadwater Farm estate

Asked why he had accused Mr Silcott, Levin told the court: ‘Because it seemed like him. It looked like him.’

Mr Griffiths said: ‘So on a belief you were willing to put someone's name forward for the murder of a police officer - that is something you are capable of doing?’

Levin answered: ‘I believed it was him at the time.’

The court heard that Levin had also placed Jacobs' cousin - who was remanded in custody for robbery at the time of the riots - at the murder scene.

After the disturbances the witness started using cocaine powder, then crack cocaine and eventually heroin, the court heard. The trial continues.
