Stuart Lancaster cut to the chase in summing up exactly why he and his England management team have gone back to Nick Easter, a blast from the distant, tainted past.

‘I think the cycle of the team has reached a point where the development bit stops,’ said the head coach. ‘It’s about the winning.’

His remark, after announcing a squad to prepare for the Six Nations opener against Wales that also includes the mercurial Danny Cipriani, will delight those who have bemoaned the frequent talk of lessons and journeys.

The pragmatic quest for results has become the first and overwhelming focus, and the inclusion of Cipriani and 36-year-old Harlequins No 8 Easter, who has been in international exile since the last World Cup, symbolises that.

After the painstaking creation of a new culture, collective spirit and sense of national pride, Lancaster and his assistants have recognised the profound need to choose the best available men to win matches, even if that means altering entrenched perceptions. So Easter, who was part of the ill-fated 2011 campaign, has been given a chance.

‘The last time I spoke to him face to face was 2011 and a fair amount of water has passed under the bridge since then,’ said Lancaster. ‘He was aware that his name was coming back into the frame and he was also aware through my conversations with Conor (O’Shea, his director of rugby) that with Ben Morgan’s injury, he could get a chance.

‘Who was to say in 2011 that he was still going to be playing as well as he is now? It’s a great credit to him for doing that and now, in a World Cup year, with Ben Morgan injured, the opportunity has arisen. To me, he expressed his desire to not finish his England career on the 2011 World Cup and to come back and finish the story.

‘He has convinced me he will buy into us as a group and I think he’ll add real value. He’s got it all on to get into the team, as we know how well Billy Vunipola is playing, but you wouldn’t rule him out because of what he has done since 2011.’

Easter has been a colossal influence for Quins this season, as he has been in so many recent campaigns, and there is some justification in his assertion that he is playing better than ever before. Forwards coach Graham Rowntree  acknowledged how he has maintained his fitness, joking: ‘He’s quick for an old-timer and you can’t dispute how well he’s playing.’

But more significant is the desire of Lancaster, Rowntree, Andy Farrell and Mike Catt to revise their view of Easter the man, given his links to the previous regime. Lancaster was adamant that his cultural revolution will not be compromised.

‘What happened in 2011 is history but also we did draw a line under it pretty quickly in January 2012,’ he said. ‘We made 15 changes to the squad. There were some difficult decisions to be made at the time. I’m confident in the culture and the environment we’ve got now and the senior players who drive it. Someone like Nick can be a part of it and add to it.’

As ever, midfield selection will generate debate ahead of the opener in Cardiff on February 6, but despite high praise for the Bath’s Kyle Eastmond and the electric Jonathan Joseph, the coaches’ pragmatism will also be illustrated by their centre choices. 

Danny Cipriani was also recalled to the England set up by head coach Lancaster on Wednesday

Farrell said: ‘Luther Burrell played well against Leicester in a big game and you’ve got to look at how Brad Barritt played in the autumn series. Against Australia he was pretty immense really.’ So: Barritt at 12, Burrell at 13. Debate over.

Meanwhile, Lancaster revealed that he will issue a further warning to hooker Dylan Hartley about his discipline after his recent three-week ban for elbowing Leicester’s Matt Smith.

‘I’m going to speak to him in camp,’ he said. ‘I’ll be making it crystal clear to Dylan one to one, but more so the team, that discipline has to be top notch. If we give away dumb penalties against Wales, Leigh Halfpenny can kick them from anywhere and it’s going to compromise our chances.’

That won’t be tolerated, not now the head coach has confirmed that results are the be-all and end-all.

Midfield balance

The perennial thorny issue — who to play at centre. Calls for Bath fliers are set to be ignored, with Brad Barritt and Luther Burrell likely to join forces against Wales.

Loosehead prop

England have an embarrassment of riches in this position. Alex Corbisiero and Mako Vunipola are Lions back from injury but Joe Marler deserves to be retained.

Second lock

Absence of Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes has left a second-row void. George Kruis emerged well in the autumn but Geoff Parling is the front-runner to partner Dave Attwood.

Scrum-half

Another area of supreme strength. Danny Care and Richard Wigglesworth are strong challengers but Ben Youngs is in great form and worthy of keeping his place for now.

Tight or loose

England’s strategic plan is unclear. They expanded their repertoire in the last Six Nations to good effect but later problems saw them revert to pack power to beat Australia.
