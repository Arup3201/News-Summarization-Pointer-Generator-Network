Iain Duncan Smith has ordered a crackdown on thousands of families with youngsters diagnosed with ‘naughty child syndrome’ who get new cars paid for by the state.

The Work and Pensions Secretary has been shocked to learn that the families of more than 3,000 people suffering Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are believed to have been given vehicles under the £1.5 billion-a-year Motability scheme.

Mr Duncan Smith is determined to stop what he regards as abuse of free cars for the disabled as part of his campaign to curb the UK’s annual £192billion benefits bill.

Luxury: The £35,000 BMW X3, which claimants can get through Motability with a top-up payment of £9,000

The number of people with cars paid for by the Government-funded Motability scheme has soared to 575,000 – up by 200,000 in just over ten years.

The number of claimants receiving disability benefit for ADHD – or hyperkinetic disorder, as it is categorised by welfare officials – has rocketed from 800 a decade ago to 43,100 last year.

An additional 55,900 claimants are given handouts for ‘behavioural disorders’, taking the total for ADHD-related conditions to 99,000. It has led to claims that a lack of proper checks has led to widespread abuse.

Mr Duncan Smith was enraged to be told initially by his department that there were no precise numbers on how many people with the condition received free cars.

Determined: Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith

However, after persistent enquiries by The Mail on Sunday, officials finally revealed that 3,200 such claimants qualified.

Motability was launched in 1978 with a handful of specially modified cars, such as motorised blue three-wheel trikes and Mini Clubman Estates with a ramp at the back for a wheelchair.

But now it is the biggest fleet-

management outfit in the UK. Mike Betts, its chief executive, earns £1.17 million a year.

Its website openly advises claimants how to use the benefit to get luxury cars such as a £30,000 Audi A6, a £35,000 BMW X3 or a £37,000 Toyota Land Cruiser.

Some doctors believe the big rise in the number of children said to have ADHD is a direct result of their parents’ right to claim disability benefit of up to £10,000 a year.

While critics believe ADHD is just a label to describe restless or naughty children, psychologists insist it is a real condition which applies when a child is persistently restless, to the point where it has a detrimental effect on their development. Some adults are also affected.

The Government says that about a third of a million children aged between six and 16 suffer with the disorder.

ADHD was almost unheard of 20 years ago, but the number of prescriptions for Ritalin – the controversial drug which suppresses symptoms – has rocketed from 2,000 in 1991 to close to 350,000.

Motability claims are processed by the
Work and Pensions Department as part of the £12 billion-a-year 
Disability Living Allowance (DLA). Successful claimants are handed over 
to Motability, which supplies the cars.

In more than seven out of ten cases people who get DLA receive it for life, with no more questions asked.

DLA is divided into two elements – 
‘care’, worth up to £294 a month, and ‘mobility’, worth an additional 
handout of up to £205 a month.

Spoiled for choice: Motability's website has a number of cars on offer

To get the mobility element, families of sufferers must prove they need ‘guidance or supervision most of the time from another person when walking out of doors in unfamiliar places’. They can either spend it themselves on transport, or have it paid direct to Motability to provide a lease car.

The £205 benefit is enough to cover the full monthly cost of cars such as a Vauxhall Astra or a Ford Focus on a three-year lease.

However, it is not means-tested. If better-off claimants want a bigger or more luxurious car, they can supplement the grant with their own cash. For example, they can get a £35,000 BMW by handing over a top-up payment of £9,000. After three years, they get another new car.

A claimant whose child has been diagnosed with ADHD can download a claim form which they can either post or submit online.

They must set out the reasons why they
should receive Disability Living Allowance – for instance, because they
have trouble dressing themselves or using the lavatory.

They should also explain why they 
qualify for the ‘mobility’ element. According to advice on a Government 
website, this would include ‘physical problems when walking out of 
doors’ and ‘needing someone with them when out of doors in unfamiliar 
places. You may, for example, need help to cross the road or avoid 
obstacles.’ The claim should be backed up by a doctor’s reference.

More than half of claims are approved without further checks.

Once accepted, the claimant completes an online application at a car showroom.

Motability confirms with the 
Department for Work and Pensions that the claim has been approved before
providing a car which suits the claimant’s needs.

More than 11,000 of the cars obtained via Motability are high-end models such as BMWs and Mercedes.

In the past year, when many 
people have been forced to sell their cars or buy second-hand because of
the recession, the number of Motability cars on the road has risen by 
35,000.

Some car dealers have promoted the Motability scheme to claimants’ relatives by assuring them that they can keep the car at a separate address and use it for personal commuting and family trips without Government investigators finding out. A total of 200,000 of the cars are used by the disabled person’s friends or relatives.

Motability’s website features reviews by What Car? magazine.

The £35,000 BMW X3 is described as ‘striking a fine balance between comfort and agility .  .  . the cabin is classy and spacious’; the £30,000 Audi A6 is ‘refined and has a luxurious, spacious interior’.

Last night a senior Whitehall source said: ‘We are determined to crack down on the spiralling disability benefit bill, stamp out abuses and increase the transparency of the system.’    

A Motability spokeswoman said: ‘The objective of the Motability scheme is to offer mobility and independence to all customers.

‘This requires a wide range of cars, adaptations and wheelchair-accessible vehicles, so that customers have access to vehicles and adaptations that suit their individual circumstances, taking account of their conditions.’

Last Sunday we said some 3,200 families of children with AttentionDeficit Hyperactivity Disorder were believed to have been given cars under the Motability scheme. In fact that total is the combined figure for two categories of recipients of the Higher Mobility component of the Disability Living Allowance and includes other behavioural disorders. Recipients choose whether or not to spend their allowance on a Motability car; generally about 30 per cent do so. Also, we described the qualification for the Lower Mobility component, rather than the Higher Mobility component required to claim a car, for which individuals must be declared virtually unable to walk.
