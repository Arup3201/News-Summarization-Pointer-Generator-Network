Prince Philip has met his great-grandson for the first time at Balmoral after he was flown on a private jet with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have chartered a private jet to take Prince George to meet his great-grandfather for the first time.

The future king's first flight was in a £14million Cessna 750 to Scotland yesterday afternoon, so he could go to see Prince Philip at Balmoral.

Renting the jet would normally cost up to £12,000 a day, but it is owned by the billionaire Duke of Westminster, Prince William's godfather, who is understood to have loaned it to them.

Royal sources told MailOnline the trip 'would not cost the taxpayer'.  

After landing at Aberdeen, eight-week-old George was taken to Balmoral, the Queen’s private Highland estate, to meet the 92-year-old royal.

The Cambridges may stay in Scotland until the end of the week, and William, who is on his first holiday since leaving the armed forces last week, is likely to unwind by going deer stalking.

Charles and Camilla are at their nearby home, Birkhall.

Philip was the only senior royal not to have met the third in line to the throne. 

At the time of George’s birth he was recuperating at Sandringham after an abdominal operation.

Now George is at Balmoral, there is a rare opportunity for a unique family photo to be taken.

For the first time in more than a century, three generations of heirs to the throne are alive: Prince Charles, 64, Prince William, 31, and newborn George.

The last time such a picture was taken was in 1894 when Queen  Victoria was photographed with her son Edward VII, grandson George V and great grandson Edward VIII. 

It is believed the Royal family will take a commemorative portrait to mark three generations of direct heirs to the throne being alive at the same time

Busy week: After stepping out last Thursday with William, the Duchess skipped a weekend wedding in Norfolk, no doubt so she could get everything in order for the trip to Scotland with her child

A royal insider said: ‘Everyone has 
been waiting for this photo to be taken, and of course the Duke of 
Edinburgh has been looking forward to seeing his great-grandson.

'It’s wonderful that the family have finally got together.’

William and Kate flew to Scotland after the prince attended the wedding of friend James Meade to Lady Laura Marsham in Norfolk on Saturday.

Kate had surprisingly stayed in London where she was spotted shopping for baby clothes in Sloane Square.
