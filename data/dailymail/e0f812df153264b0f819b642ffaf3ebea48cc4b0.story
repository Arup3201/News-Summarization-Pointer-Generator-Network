The Football Association refused to be drawn into a public row with Sol Campbell after the former England defender claimed he was denied the chance to become an established national team captain because the governing body is institutionally racist.

Officials at Wembley were left stunned by Campbell’s remarks. Not least because of the support the FA has given to the Kick It Out campaign in combating  racism and the fact that the choice of captain has almost always been the manager’s decision.

In a new authorised biography, Campbell, 39, says: ‘I believe if I was white I would’ve been England captain for more than 10 years. It’s as simple as that.

Missing out: Sol Campbell was capped 73 times for England but captain just three times

Rare: Campbell was captain for three friendly games in 1998 and 2005 but never received it long term

‘I think the FA wished I was white. I 
had the credibility,  performance-wise, to be captain. I was 
consistently in the heart of the defence and I was club captain early on
 in my career. I don’t think it will change because they don’t want it 
to.’

Campbell went on to ask: ‘Are there elements in the FA who are racist? Is the FA always the leader of football it should be?’

He
 has been supported in the book, to some extent, by former FA chairman 
Lord Triesman. ‘It is more likely if he was white that he would have 
captained England more,’ said Triesman. ‘I don’t subscribe to the view 
that it (the FA) was consciously  racist but I think there is an 
assumption of a type of person who should captain England.’

Campbell also said he did not understand why former Liverpool striker Michael Owen was made captain ahead of him.

‘The
 more caps I won, the further away I seemed to be pushed from becoming 
captain,’ said Campbell. ‘I played well, acted honourably on and off the
 field, but there was little recognition.

‘Owen
 was a fantastic forward but nowhere near being a captain. It was 
embarrassing. I kept asking myself, what have I done? I’ve asked myself 
many times why I wasn’t (made captain). I keep coming up with the same 
answer. It was the colour of my skin.’

Campbell
 became the second youngest skipper after World Cup-winner Bobby Moore 
when, aged 23 years and 248 days, he captained England under Glenn 
Hoddle against Belgium in 1998.

Hoddle
 gave him the armband again that year against the Czech Republic. His 
third and last game as captain was against the United States in 2005 
when Sven Goran Eriksson was boss.

Campbell
 played in an era when other black players have worn the armband, Paul 
Ince and Rio Ferdinand among them. Had Ferdinand not suffered an injury 
shortly before the start of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, 
Ferdinand would have been England’s captain in South Africa — albeit 
after John Terry, who was originally selected ahead of the Manchester 
United defender, had been stripped of the captaincy.

Only
 recently the FA came under fire when Heather Rabbatts, the first black 
and female member of the FA board, pointed out that the commission 
appointed by new chairman Greg Dyke to conduct a review of the English 
game was exclusively white.

David
 Davies, the former FA executive director whose time at the governing 
body coincided with Campbell’s 73-cap England career, refuted the 
accusations.

‘I am 
surprised by this because the reality is that in my time the managers 
selected the captain,’ Davies told the BBC. ‘I never — and to my 
knowledge nobody else in the FA — ever sought to influence them. My 
belief is the allegations are wrong. I also have to say I am quite 
proud, along with a number of people of that era, of setting up Kick It 
Out in football. Progress was made. I would love to talk to Sol about 
this concern he has about why he wasn’t the England captain.

‘He
 clearly is upset about that time and he feels that perhaps he should 
have been, he would believe, more seriously considered as the England 
captain.’

A former team-mate
 with England and Arsenal, Sportsmail’s Martin Keown was also surprised 
by Campbell’s attack. ‘I know Sol very well,’ he said. ‘Yes, he was 
deserving of being captain more often but I understand why he wasn’t. I 
think Sol could have gone about this in a different way. We have to 
respect his view but he could have probably done something on the 
inside. We don’t need this sensationalism and I do not know whether this
 helps any young black player coming into the game.’

Asked
 if Campbell would have made a good England captain, Keown said: ‘Yes. 
He wasn’t very vocal, more of a visual leader but he was a leader. I 
feel disappointed this has come out in this way. He could have spoken to
 someone in the FA and tried to explain his story. The FA has to respond
 to this.

'We have had black captains and this is dragging us back across a bridge we have already crossed.’
