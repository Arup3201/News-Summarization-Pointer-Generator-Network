Tom Clarke’s 87th-minute winner for Preston against bitter rivals Blackpool sparked ugly scenes which ended with a steward being trampled by two police horses and taken to hospital.

The Lancashire derby atmosphere boiled over when hundreds of home supporters flooded the Deepdale pitch at the final whistle.

Simon Grayson’s side had booked their place into the Capital One Cup second round, but the significance of beating Blackpool in the first meeting for over three years became too much for some. A Preston spokesman said: ‘A steward was injured by a police horse. He suffered damage to his shoulder and has gone for an X-ray.’

Treatment: The steward was taken to hospital for a shoulder X-ray

Match commander Chief Inspector Nick 
Emmett said: 'The behaviour of those involved in 
the disorder and the behaviour of some people towards officers and 
stewards was absolutely disgraceful.

'This
was a very difficult situation which presented significant challenges 
for both the club and for ourselves and we were able to bring the 
situation under control quickly. The disorder last night was completely 
unacceptable and we will be making significant efforts to locate and 
prosecute those involved. 

Blackpool manager Paul Ince was apoplectic afterwards and feared for the safety of his players.

‘It’s an absolute joke,’ he fumed. ‘Who knows what could happen? It’s going to take someone to get stabbed or something else to happen before we’re going to listen.

‘I wonder if there are enough stewards there. You see enough situations in football where fans are hitting a player. We sit down at these management meetings and talk about these respect campaigns, but what about getting enough stewards to control people?

‘I can understand excitement from 
supporters but there are enough frightening things that have happened to
players to clamp down on this.

‘Who
are the stewards anyway? Are they Preston fans? If they are they 
shouldn’t be stewards. They just let people run on the pitch. It’s not 
just Preston – it’s football in general.

‘We need to knuckle down because you can’t have fans running on the pitch. I don’t care whether they win, lose or draw.’

Fans fell over advertising hoardings in their insistence to get as close to the Bill Shankly Kop as possible. Police tried to act swiftly to diffuse the situation with horses employed to disperse the crowd, but in turn flattened a steward on what was a sad night for English football.

One away supporter managed to confront the hundreds before him on the pitch and while Grayson was more laid back about the incident than his opposite number, Preston though are worried that they will now face serious FA ramifications.

‘Hopefully it was only supporters being boisterous and there’s nothing too intense or any damage to anybody,’ the manager said. ‘I’m not saying I’m pleased they did it. I hope not too many people were seriously injured Hopefully in the next few days everybody settles down.’  

An FA spokesman said: 'We are aware of this and will be looking into what happened, including liaising with both clubs and the police to get a full picture of events and what preparations were in place.'

Trouble had been rumbling on throughout the day. A number of Blackpool fans didn’t even make it to the match and were escorted back to the seaside town by train.

Inside the ground, pipes were ripped out of the away end’s toilets.

Late winner: Tom Clarke's header gave Preston North End a 1-0 win

A car had been set ablaze in the city centre earlier in the afternoon, although that hasn’t officially been labelled a football matter.

The football itself was drab. Preston manager Grayson was facing his old employers for the first time since moving over to Deepdale but neither he nor Ince could inspire much creative spark and there was a lack of clear-cut opportunities.

There were plenty of gutsy displays and a heap of endeavour but the dearth of quality indicated two sides still rusty and too keen on not making mistakes.

There remained an edge to proceedings all evening and the lid almost flew off when Clarke’s thumping downward header from Lee Holmes’ free-kick put Preston through.

Grayson added: ‘It shows everybody what it means to this club. We played well tonight - kept our shape and worked hard.

‘They’ve got good players and we knew we couldn’t be gung-ho and go chasing the game. We could have got done on the counter attack.’

Ince called the defeat ‘daylight robbery’ but his son, Tom, was the only one to threaten for the visitors. But even he wasted a clutch of chances – while the hosts were largely restricted to efforts from distance until Iain Hume’s turn and shot forced Matt Gilks into a decent save.

Angel Martinez, Michael Chopra and Gary MacKenzie all went close for Blackpool after the break but Clarke proved the difference before the shameful scenes afterwards.
