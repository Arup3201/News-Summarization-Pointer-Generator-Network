More than five years after her roommate was brutally murdered, Amanda Knox says she just wants to be seen as a human being again - and made a plea to be allowed to visit Meredith Kercher's grave.

Knox, 25, says media coverage and scandalous accusations from Italian prosecutors - who called her a 'she-devil with an angel face' and 'concertante of sex' - have made people see her as something different from who she really is.

She made the revelation in an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer to promote her new book, 'Waiting to be Heard' and in a separate interview with USA Today.

Amanda Knox spoke with ABC News' Diane Sawyer in New York. She has now revealed that she is 'proud' of having a string of one night stands and smoking marijuana at university

'I’d like to be reconsidered as a person,' Knox said in an interview to be aired tonight at 10pm EST on the network. 'What happened to me was surreal but it could’ve happened to anyone.'

She also issued a plea to be 'allowed' to visit the cemetary in Mitcham, south London. 'I really want to go see her grave,' said Knox in an interview with USA Today. 'And right now I don’t feel like I have the right to without her family’s permission. So that’s something that I want to work toward to get closure.'

Knox with living with British student Meredith Kercher, 21, as an exchange student in 
Perugia when Kercher was found in her bedroom, semi-naked and
with her throat cut, in 2007.

Knox, 25, and her Italian boyfriend 
Raffaele Sollecito, 29, spent four years in jail until their convictions
for Miss Kercher’s murder were overturned in 2011.

They are now facing a retrial after Italy’s highest appeals court quashed their acquittals last month.In Waiting To Be Heard, Knox recalls a life of drug use and casual sex as she travelled around Italy en-route to Perugia.

She said that when she was in the courtroom during her trial, she was a murderer to everyone present - no matter that she did not commit the heinous crime.

'I was in the courtroom when they were calling me "devil,"' she told ABC. 'I mean, it’s, it’s one thing to be called certain things in the media and then it’s another thing to be sitting in a courtroom, fighting for your life, while people are calling you a devil.'

Earlier, Knox claimed she is ‘proud’ 
of a string of one-night stands she had as a student and admitted that 
marijuana was her ‘vice’.

In her autobiography out tomorrow, 
Knox reveals that cannabis was ‘as common as pasta’ at the Italian 
apartment she shared with murdered British student Meredith Kercher.

Her first one-night stand was with a man called Cristiano, whom she met on a train in Florence.She wrote: ‘We shared a joint, and then, high and giggly, we went to his hotel room.

‘I’d just turned 20. This was my first one-night stand. 

‘I’d told friends I couldn’t see myself sleeping with some random guy. But Cristiano was a game-changer.’

Two
weeks after arriving in Perugia from her home in the US she had sex 
with an Italian named Mirko, who invited her back to his house for 
pizza. She says she later discussed this with her housemate Miss 
Kercher, a Leeds University student from Coulsdon, Surrey.

Knox wrote: ‘I was proud of myself 
for having a no-strings-attached consensual encounter but I felt awkward
and out of place. I didn’t yet know if I’d regret it. 

‘Later I told Meredith about the sex and feeling “like an idiot”.

‘“Amanda”, she said, consolingly, “Maybe uninvolved sex just isn’t for you”.’

Knox later slept with ‘Bobby from Rome’, before meeting Sollecito a few weeks later at a classical music concert.

She
says she found him ‘nerdy and adorable’ and recalled how, before they 
had sex for the first time, she told him that making faces made her 
laugh. 

She wrote: ‘We made faces until we collided in a kiss. Then we had sex. It felt totally natural.’

Knox
was reportedly paid £2.5million by HarperCollins for the autobiography,
which goes on sale tomorrow in the US, Canada and Australia.

The
book will not be sold in the UK, reportedly because of  ‘libel fears’ 
surrounding the retrial and separate defamation cases in Italy against 
Knox and her parents.

In extracts published by the Sun newspaper, Knox describes how she and Sollecito bonded over their mutual love of cannabis.

Soon after meeting, Knox asked him: ‘Do you like marijuana?’, to which he said, ‘It’s my vice’. 

‘It’s my vice, too’, she replied.  Knox, who was in Perugia for the third year of an Italian, German and creative writing degree, said: ‘Around our house marijuana was as common as pasta. We all chipped in. It was purely social.’

Knox also describes how she became suicidal locked up in a women’s prison outside Perugia. 

She wrote: ‘I imagined myself as a corpse. It made me feel sick, not relieved, but it was a fantasy I had many times – terrible, desperate recurring thoughts that I never shared with a soul.’

She also recalled the sexual advances made by her cellmate Cera, who had the ‘tall, lean looks of a model’.

She said: ‘One morning I was walking into the bathroom to put something away, I bumped into Cera and she kissed me on the lips.’

Following their release from prison, Sollecito moved to Switzerland while Knox returned to Seattle to finish her degree at the University of Washington.

She has been in a relationship with classical guitar student James Terrano, 25, for 18 months.

Knox cannot be compelled by Italian law to appear at the retrial and might not face extradition for years, if at all. 

A third suspect, Rudy Guede, whose DNA and bloody footprints were found all over the crime scene, is serving a 16-year prison sentence for Miss Kercher’s murder.
