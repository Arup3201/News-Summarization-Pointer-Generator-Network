Acquitted Trayvon Martin killer George Zimmerman’s latest dust-up hasn’t prevented him from getting his small arsenal back from local police.

Mr Zimmerman, 30, had his five guns seized after being arrested last month and charged with domestic assault after a fight with girlfriend Samantha Scheibe, 27.

The pair both picked up their guns and ammunition from the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office together Wednesday – her’s were seized at the time as well, according to the New York Daily News.

Ms Scheibe called police November 18 to report that Mr Zimmerman had pointed a shot gun at her in their home – leading to police to arrest him and seize his firearms.

‘You put your gun in my freakin' face!’ Ms Scheibe yelled at her infamous boyfriend during the 911 call. ‘Get out of my house. Do not push me out of my house. Please get out of my house,’ she continued.

‘He pushed me out of my house and locked me out… He knows how to do this, he knows how to play this game,’ she told the dispatcher.

Cops took a .380-caliber handgun, a 9-mm handgun, a Glock 19 handgun, a Kel-Tec 12-gauge shotgun and an AR-15 assault-style rifle that belonged to Mr Zimmerman, according to the New York Daily News.

He also recovered more than 100 rounds of ammunition taken by authorities as well.

Mr Zimmerman was also famously served divorce papers by his estranged wife Shellie Zimmerman while sitting in jail before posting bail.

The blonde was not injured during the altercation, but was clearly shaken by his aggressive behaviour.

A friend of Ms Schiebe’s told MailOnline in the days after the altercation that many feared the relationship would end badly.

‘We would all talk about where the relationship was going, and we knew it would end badly,’ the woman said. ‘He is just a time bomb waiting to go off.'

Her comments echoed those of Lake Mary police chief Steve Bracknell, who also agreed via email to a concerned resident that Mr Zimmerman is ‘a ticking time bomb.’

Given the latest developments, in which Ms Schiebe did an about-face and denied Mr Zimmerman ever pointed the gun at her, authorities had no choice but to give him back his guns.

A Lake Mary Police spokesperson told MailOnline earlier this year that though there is the perception that Mr Zimmerman is a threat, authorities have no choice but to allow him to have his guns unless he is convicted of a crime that would bar him from doing so.
