A senior member of an Al Qaeda-affiliated terror group has spoken out in support of Peter Kassig - the American aid worker threatened by the Islamic State following the murder of Alan Henning.

Abu Omar Aqidi - a prominent member of the Syria-based Nusra Front - pleaded with ISIS to spare Kassig's life after he identified the Muslim convert as a medic who helped treat his shrapnel wounds.

Kassig is a former Methodist who converted to Islam after being captured and taken prisoner by ISIS in October last year and now calls himself Abdul Rahman.

His life was threatened by the militant known as 'Jihadi John' earlier this month following the sickening filmed beheading of Henning - with ISIS sympathisers last night claiming the terrorists plan to murder Kassig in the coming days after a Wednesday 'deadline' for the U.S. to stop bombing them passed.

Aqidi's unexpected intervention came in a series of messages posted on Twitter, in which he identified Kassig as an aid worker who  'performed a successful operation under bombardment by the regime'. He later explained this operation was to remove shrapnel from his leg.

He also suggested that Kassig had treated a number of other fighters linked to the Nusra Front - including 'Abu Dujana', who is understood to be one of the regional leaders of the terror group. 

Aqidi went on to suggest that the senior Nusra Front fighters had later asked after Kassig and were surprised when 'he showed up in the video where ISIS threatened the United States' as they had wrongly assumed him to be a Western jihadist who had joined their ranks.

'It later became clear to me that he's an humanitarian activist that served in Deir Al-Zour for more than a year and was then kidnapped by ISIS,' the militant said.

Kassig's case has exposed deep divisions among supporters of the Islamic State, many of whom have said it would be a great sin to murder a recent Muslim convert.

Both extremists who met Kassig before he embraced Islam and former prisoners who were held alongside him have argued that the aid worker's conversion is without doubt sincere.

Aquidi's remarks on Twitter came as ISIS supporters said a deadline for the U.S. to stop bombing the terror group in Syria and Iraq had expired. 

They claimed American citizen Kassig would now be murdered as a result - a statement that led to a  number of arguments among the jihadists and their sympathisers on social media.

The 26-year-old is said to be haunted by a brief spell as a US army ranger in Iraq in 2007 and first travelled to the Middle East to 'give back' to the Muslim community there.

In late 2012, shortly after leaving university, he founded SERA (Special Emergency Response and Assistance) - a non-governmental organisation providing  humanitarian aid to those in desperate need - and moved to southern Turkey to oversee the project first hand.

With funds dwindling, Kassig continued to make risky ventures into Syria by himself - even after a large number of Westerners were kidnapped by the brutal Islamic State. He was said to have specialised in providing medical aid to fighters and civilians injured during clashes with regime forces.

He was eventually seized by the jihadists on 1 October, 2013 while delivering medical supplies to Deir al-Zour.

Leader: Yesterday Norwegian-born journalist Salah ad-Din Refsdal made a direct plea to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) to 'do the only right thing' and stop his followers killing Peter Kassig

Jihadi John's promise to murder Kassig if the U.S. doesn't end its airstrikes has illuminated deep divisions within the jihadist community over how the terror group should have dealt with the situation.

Numerous ISIS sympathisers have claimed they would no longer support the terror group if they killed Kassig - a man they consider to be a pious Muslim.

Although radical clerics from around the world had pleaded for Briton Alan Henning's life to be spared due to his aid work, the calls failed to pick up much support within the online jihadist community as he was not as Muslim himself.

Yesterday Norwegian-born journalist Salah ad-Din Refsdal - who was born Paul Refsdal but converted to Islam while a prisoner of the Taliban in Afghanistan - made a direct plea to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to 'do the only right thing' and stop his followers killing Kassig.

Citing a rule condemning the killing of converts, Resdal said: 'People have suggested that Caliph Ibrahim is not informed that some of his followers are planning to murder Abdul Rahman Kassig.'

'That must clearly be the case. Having studied Islam extensively he for sure is aware of how enormous of a sin it would be to murder a brother who just converted to Islam.'
