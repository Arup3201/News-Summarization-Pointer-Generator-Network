Bayern Munich were given a rude awakening when a fire alarm forced them to evacuate their hotel in Moscow and spend over an hour outside.

Pep Guardiola's side found themselves out on the street shortly before midnight and didn't make it back inside until around one in the morning.

The players were spotted huddling under blankets in temperatures of around 10 degrees.

The club's official Twitter account revealed that after initially waiting around outside the hotel, the players wandered off to find shelter in a restaurant. 

Bayern supporters may be worried about the implications of the late night ahead of their side's Champions League match, but Manuel Neuer laughed it off.

He said: 'It wasn't a problem. It was like being back at school and doing a fire drill.'
