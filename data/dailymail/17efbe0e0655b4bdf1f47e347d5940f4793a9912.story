Experts today claimed a group of wallabies have been living wild in the British countryside for 60 years after one was spotted darting in front of a taxi.

Driver Tomas Tarjan, 32, was taking a group of girls home in the middle of the night when he spotted the animal hopping across the road.

He said: 'This is the weirdest thing I
have seen. I said to the girls I was sure we did not live in Australia.
We spent 40 to 50 minutes searching for the animal.

Unexpected: The wallaby was snapped by astonished Jessica Wiltshire, 20, one of the passengers in the taxi

Unlikely habitat: The village of Barton, Cambridgeshire, where the wild wallaby was spotted

'As I had my hazards on, several taxis stopped. When I said we were looking for a kangaroo they just asked me if I was alright.

'The girls in the back seat called 
the police - they sent two cars and when they saw the picture we had 
taken they started searching.'

Jessica was stunned when the wallaby hopped across the road in the Cambridgeshire countryside as she went home after a night out

Jessica Wiltshire, 20, one of the passengers in the taxi, said she thought it was hilarious and managed to snap a picture of the marsupial, usually found in the Australian outback.

She said: 'I quickly got my phone out and took a picture of it because I thought no-one was going to believe me.'

Police officers eventually caught the animal in the early hours of Sunday morning but were told by experts to let it go - as it had probably spent all its life in the wild.

Astonishingly, the marsupial is believed to be descended from a group of wallabies which escaped from Whipsnade Zoo, Bedfordshire, in the 1950s.

Experts believe the resourceful group have managed to survive off shrubs and vegetation and even breed despite the harsh British winters.

Animal officers yesterday said they planned to leave the wallaby and any of its relatives free to roam in the wild where they have made their home.

Members of the public have been warned to leave the animals to their own devices if spotted out in the countryside.

A spokeswoman for Shepreth Wildlife park said it probably descended from wallabies which escaped from Whipsnade Zoo 60 years ago.

She said: 'It could be a private collector that lost one or it could be one of these ones that has decided to make its way across country.

'They will live on foliage and berries so there is plenty of food for them out there so they have nothing to worry about.

'Itâ€™s not the sort of thing a fox would go for - they have got quite a kick on them.'

A spokesman for Cambridgeshire police said they had located the creature and contacted wallaby owners in the area but no-one reported theirs missing.

But the RSPCA and Shepreth Wildlife park advised them to leave the animal where it was because it is likely to be wild.
