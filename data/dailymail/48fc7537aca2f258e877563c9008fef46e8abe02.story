AÂ  male burqa-clad Taliban militant has been arrested at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan after his unconvincing disguise failed to trick immigration officials.

The tall, bearded man was spotted by Afghan Border Police at the Torkham checkpoint which separates Nangarhar province in Afghanistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan.

Accompanied by another male militant, 
the man wore a brown burqa covering his face and body, over a blue 
collared shirt and a black salwar kameez, which is traditional Afghan 
dress for men.

The burqa appeared too short for the militant, revealing his shoes, ankles and clothes underneath.

He wore black men's boots and underneath his veil the man had a full beard - which is deemed a religious requirement by the Taliban.

Unsurprisingly, his outfit failed to dupe border police, who arrested him and took him to their headquarters in Jalalabad, Nangarhar province, east of Kabul.

The man, who has not been named, was presented to the public in order to discourage others from attempting similar ploys to outsmart border police.

He towered over the guards supervising him and his face remained obscured as the burqa was pulled up to reveal his beard.

His companion, who wore traditional Afghan men's clothing, was also arrested and brought before the media while blindfolded and accompanied by armed guards.

Traditional Afghan dress for women varies between regions and ethnicities and can be very colourful.

But as burqas are full-length garments which cover most of the body, it is possible one of the reasons the militant was caught out was due to the fact that part of his burqa fell above the knee because of his height.
