A woman angry at cuts being made to council services has decided to take matters into her own hands, by employing a handywoman to do jobs in the area. 

Former Dragon's Den contestant Ling Valentine, 41, has employed Clare Honey, 40, on a £16,000 salary to do 'absolutely anything that needs doing in the community' after council cuts hit local services in Grange Villa in County Durham. Mrs Valentine pays the wages herself. 

Ms Honey, a former carer, also has her own motorised buggy provided by Mrs Valentine, and carries out any jobs local residents need including clearing rubbish, cutting hedges and going on patrol to find where street lights need replacing and the elderly need help.

The scheme has been so successful Ms Honey has won the backing of Durham Police for her help to clear up the local community and make people feel safe and proud of their area. 

Mrs Valentine, a businesswoman who runs a car leasing firm, decided to place an advert for a handyman or woman to help clear up the community after she fell victim to a string of thefts and was told there were few resources to sort out the village.

She said: 'Back in September last year we had a break in with someone trying to steal our Land Rover. We challenged him and he picked up this Stanley knife. After the event I threw my toys out of the pram. We had already had bikes stolen. I just said we have to do something about this village.

'I had a meeting with the police and council but I was told there was not enough funds to clean up the village with police saying they only had a certain level of man power. It maybe the nature of the times and everybody is cutting back and yet money is wasted money relentlessly on things.' 

Mrs Valentine decided to find her own solution to the problem and employed Ms Honey instead, equipping her with her own uniform and tools as well as a JCB - emblazoned with signs that say: 'Stop me, ask me for free help.' 

As part of her role Ms Honey carries out daily patrols, clearing rubbish and notifying police of any break-ins. She even fixes light bulbs in people's houses and sits with the elderly. She has been ordered by Mrs Valentine to ignore councillors who claim she needs an Environmental licence to pick up rubbish.

She added: 'Clare does anything that needs doing in the locality - but obviously within reason. She picks litter, washes the bus stops and telephone boxes, picks up dog mess and helps anyone out. If an elderly person needs their ivy trimmed from the house - Clare will do it. Even if they need the newspaper paper picked up from the newsagents she will do it.'

Following the Autumn statement, Durham County Council is expected to have to cut £16.2million from its budget in the next 12 months. It also recently came under fire for switching to fortnightly bin collections - which councillors claim has saved £5million. 

Last year the council also announced proposals to consult over the closure of five of its remaining care homes - saving an estimated £4million.  

Mrs Valentine said she feels council cuts have led to local areas like Grange Villa suffering and that resources are not always used in the best way. 

She said:  'They send out highly trained operative to specialised vehicles and protective clothing just to pick up a mattress lying around. How much does that cost? My view was that if a job needed doing well, you do it yourself.

'What Clare is doing is maintaining the village, doing what the council used to do. We used to have street sweepers on the streets permanently. But now I think the council will only come around once every three months or so with a team and they clean the streets. The trouble is the mess builds up in between.'

Mrs Valentine is pictured with the Help truck she bought and Durham Constabulary's Mike Barton, who has backed the project and said keeping the community clean and safe is a way of showing people they care 

Mrs Valentine has paid for signs to be put up throughout the village, welcoming people and making them aware who their PCSO is - winning the backing of police.  

Durham Constabulary's Chief Constable Mike Barton, told the Chronicle: 'This embodies what is really special about Grange Villa, where a community is taking the initiative and exhibiting what a great little village it is.

'Crime happens but County Durham is one of the safest places to live in the UK. It is great that Ling and John have led the way here

If there is no litter, graffiti or dog poo in a community then people like living there as they can see that people care.'

As part of her role Ms Honey notifies police where there have been break-ins or property damaged.

Ms Honey has been in the role since November and police said it has already been a success in Grange Villa 

Grange Villa PCSO Steve Larter said: 'Grange Villa has had a reputation for a number of years as being something of a problem area. Clare has been in the role for a month or so and things seem to be going really well.'

Ms Valentine became a well-known character after she appeared on Dragon's Den in 2007 and turned down an offer of £50,000 to invest in her business - LINGsCARS.

Shortly after starting the job in November, Ms Honey posted cards to all the houses of Grange Villa notifying them of the new service provided by Mrs Valentine.

Ms Honey added: 'We posted leaflets when we started in everyone's doors. It was a bit weird at first as people would pass me and say 'morning Clare' and I would think 'how do they know my name?' I really enjoy the job. Ling just lets me get on with it.'

Ling Valentine previously appeared on Dragon's Den but turned down an offer of £50,000 investment 

'It is a bizarre and unique job and when I saw it I realised it was the job for me - I don't think anywhere else does it. '

Oliver Sherratt, Durham County Council's head of direct services, said: 'The council has not significantly reduced clean and green services in the Grange Villas area or indeed anywhere else in the county. Most of the savings we have made have involved improving the efficiency of the services we provide for example, by cutting down our number of depots and reorganising but not reducing working hours.

'We do, however, welcome local communities doing what they can in partnership with the council to improve their local area.'
