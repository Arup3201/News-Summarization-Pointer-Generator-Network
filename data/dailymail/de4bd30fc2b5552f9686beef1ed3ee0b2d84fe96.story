The BBC's TV controller has today defended Jeremy Clarkson and insisted the Top Gear host is not 'racist'.

Danny Cohen said he 'disagreed' with some of the language used by the presenter, but did not think anyone on the team was racist.

Mr Cohen's comments came after it emerged he launched an internal investigation into the controversial show, which has been hit in recent months by a string of controversies.

BBC TV controller Danny Cohen launched an internal investigation into the culture of Top Gear after Jeremy Clarkson used the word 'n*****' during an outtake - but Mr Cohen says the presenter is not 'racist'

The investigation was instigated after footage was leaked showing Clarkson using the word 'n*****' in an outtake.

Last week, the show was also separately criticised by 
communications watchdog Ofcom for breaching broadcasting rules after the 54-year-old used a 'racial' term in the Burma special.

But, in a letter to The Guardian, Mr Cohen 
said: 'I want Top Gear to maintain its unique take on the world but more controversies of this nature would serve no one well.

'Whilst, Jeremy and I disagree on the language some have recently found very offensive I do not think he or anyone on the Top Gear team are racist.'

He added that it 
was 'no secret' there had been 'some significant issues' on the show, which he why he had 'instigated a health check... to ensure that there 
were no further issues'.

The inquiry was triggered after unaired footage emerged in May, showing the presenter reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo'. He then apparently muttered 'catch a n***** by his toe'.

Although Clarkson initially denied the allegations, he later made a 'grovelling apology' for using the word.

In a letter, Danny Cohen said: 'More controversies of this nature would serve no one well. Whilst, Jeremy and I disagree on the language some have recently found very offensive I do not think he or anyone on the Top Gear team are racist'

Clarkson 
was not fired over the furore, but he was given a final warning and TV controller Mr Cohen reportedly ordered a review 
of the show’s culture and practices.

The BBC has refused
 to release the findings of the investigation since it was completed last month.

Mr Cohen said it was 'no secret' that there had been issued over language used by Jeremy Clarkson, above, in the show

But it is understood that Mr Cohen 'wanted to launch 
disciplinary action against Clarkson'.

He met with production bosses to discuss the
 issues raised in the report - but was allegedly blocked from further action by BBC 
director-general Lord Hall.

During the investigation, which took four to six weeks, it is understood that all Top Gear 
staff were asked for their views on whether the hit show is racist.

They
 were also asked whether they felt afraid to speak out to their 
superiors when they felt parts of the programme were offensive.

Investigators also interviewed Clarkson and his co-presenters James May and 
Richard Hammond as well as Top Gear’s executive producer Andy Wilman.

The stars of the show were reportedly reminded of their 
‘responsibilities as BBC employees’.

Earlier this month, in a separate incident, broadcasting regulator 
Ofcom found Clarkson ‘deliberately’ used racist language during an episode 
filmed in Burma, which was screened in March.

The row broke out after the three 
hosts were tasked 
with building a bridge over the River Kwai in Thailand during the series
 finale.

After completion, Clarkson said: 'That is a proud 
moment, but there's a slope on it', as a man walked towards him on a 
makeshift bridge. 'Slope' is a derogatory term for those of Asian descent.

The show also came under fire when Clarkson, 54, used the word 'slope' - a derogatory term for those of Asian descent - during an episode filmed in Burma. Ofcom ruled BBC had used an 'offensive racial term'

Co-presenter Richard Hammond, 44, replied: 'You're right, it's definitely higher on that side.'

In its report, Ofcom said the broadcaster was in breach of its code for using an 'offensive racial term' which was 'not justified by context'.

It said: 'Jeremy Clarkson used the word 'slope' to refer both to an Asian man crossing a bridge, and the incline of the bridge.

'This
 was scripted in advance. The BBC failed to take the opportunity, either
 during filming or post-production, to check whether the word had the 
potential to offend viewers.'

In its representations to Ofcom, 
the BBC said programme makers were aware the word was 'used to refer to 
people of Asian origin' but they considered 'such use was mere slang'.

It
 added they were not aware it had the potential to cause offence outside
 the UK and would not have used it, had they been aware.

Following
 the Ofcom ruling, the BBC said: 'We dealt with this matter some time 
ago, the programme apologised at the time and explained the context, and
 we are now focusing on delivering another series of one of Britain's 
best loved shows.'

That was not the first - or last time - that Jeremy Clarkson has sparked controversy with some of his comments.

Weeks
 later, in unaired footage of the series, the 54-year-old presenter was 
heard reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo' before apparently 
muttering 'catch a n***** by his toe'.

It
 took place during filming of the third episode of Top Gear series 19 as
 the star reviewed the £25,000 Toyota GT86 and the Subaru BRZ - which 
costs around the same amount.

Telling
 viewers that they may find it difficult to differentiate between the 
two vehicles he demonstrated how to do it using the child's counting 
rhyme.

After
 initially denying the claims, Clarkson 'begged' for forgiveness, saying
 he 'did everything in [his] power to not use that word', but that his 
'efforts weren't quite good enough.'

Jeremy
 Clarkson was also accused of racism for naming his black West Highland 
terrier dog Didier Dogba after former Chelsea star Didier Drogba, who is
 from the Ivory Coast.

Clarkson became embroiled in a second race row, just weeks after the 'slope' controversy

Clarkson,
 who often mocks political correctness, asked: 'Why is it racist to name
 our amazingly brilliant dog after a footballer?'

In 2012, the presenter compared 
synchronised swimming to the deaths of 23 Chinese cockle pickers in 
Morecambe Bay in 2004.

He also provoked a flood of complaints when 
he said his new TV’s energy-saving setting made it seem as if programmes
 were being ‘presented by Lenny Henry in a cave’.

In
 December 2011, the controversial host came under under fire for 
suggesting on BBC's The One Show that public sector strikers 'be shot in front of their families' - which prompted 31,000 complaints.

Weeks
 later, he provoked a fresh storm of protest after describing people who
 kill themselves by jumping under trains as 'selfish'.

In
 his newspaper column in The Sun, Clarkson wrote that 'foxy woxy and the
 birds' should be left to 'nibble' at the 'gooey parts' of people who 
die by jumping in front of trains.

An episode of the show filmed in India was also criticised by Indian 
diplomats.

The BBC also had to apologise to the Mexican ambassador after 
remarks made by Clarkson and co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond.
