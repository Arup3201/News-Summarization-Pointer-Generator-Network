The person who found abandoned explosive is said to have taken it home and left it in front of an open fire.

The fire's heat is said to have set the firework off - injuring the group of people who are thought to be between the ages of 16 and 35.

The two who suffered extensive injuries to their hands were forced to have them amputated atRomeâ€™s Umberto I hospital.

The person with stomach wounds was also treated there, according to The Local.

Find: It is thought the group found the explosive following New Year's Eve celebrations. Dozens suffered firework-related injuries in the country when welcoming 2014 this year

Those with minor injuries were taken to the local Tivoli hospital.

Only a few dozen people suffered firework related injuries in Italy this New Year,  compared to 361 injured and two fatalities the previous year.

In the UK around 1,000 are thought to be injured every year, with five per cent of those serious.
