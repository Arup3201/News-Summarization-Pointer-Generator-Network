An animal-obsessed photographer is looking to eliminate the stereotype of the 'crazy cat lady' by snapping portraits of his male friends and their felines - proving that the agile pets are also man's best friend.  

David Williams, who lives in Brooklyn, New York, with his own cat, has been photographing his male subjects and their felines since 2009 as part of his project Men & Cats. 

'I found the way society genderizes animal ownership very compelling,' he told Daily Mail Online in an email. 'As a portrait photographer I was interested in capturing the relationships of my male friends and their feline friends.'

The 25-year-old, who will turn 26 this week, added: 'It was also a good excuse to hang out with a bunch of cats!'

Mr Williams explained that the subjects of his ongoing project are either his friends, or friends of friends.

Each thought-provoking portrait in the series features a man posing with one or more of his cats.

Although many of the shots were captured inside homes or apartments, there are images that show some men walking their cats on a leash or cuddling their feline companions outside.

'People have always responded well to the images and the idea,' Mr Williams said. 'Sometimes shooting personal work takes a very long time to pay off, so it’s also important to photograph something that you are interested in.' 

Earlier this week, Mr Williams shot a portrait of cinematographer Ronen Schechner with his cat, sharing the photo on his Instagram.

'I had the pleasure of photographing cinematographer, Ronen Schechner, with his cat Isabell while I was in Vermont yesterday. I never thought this project would take off like this, so thanks for all the love lately! Hope you enjoy this new "Men & Cats" photo,' he captioned the picture. 

The unique series is more than just a hobby, it's a way for Mr Williams to showcase his work.

'I feel like shooting personal work is very important for a photographer,' he explained. 'It gives me an opportunity to show photo editors and art buyers what I am capable to doing when I have complete creative control.'

He added: 'If I’m not shooting commissioned work, I am either shooting something personal, or working on ways for me to stand out as a photographer.'
