It's hard to think of anything cuter than a litter of newborn puppies - but this bundle manage it.

With their uncanny resemblance to pandas this trio are in high demand, with their owner claiming that she has been overwhelmed with offers to buy the adorable six-week-old dogs.

Their Chinese owner says their looks are a complete coincidence, and they were not bred to look this way.

The puppies' mother was an ordinary stray dog from the Chinese countryside which was apparently crossed with a neighbour's dog that was originally from Beijing.

But when they were born at the woman's house in the city of Yancheng in east China’s Jiangsu province, the puppies bore no resemblance to either of their parents, and instead look much more like giant panda cubs.

After they were featured on local media the pictures were widely shared in China and owner Lin Su said she has now been flooded with offers.

Are these mine? The mother was bred with a neighbour's dog that was originally from Beijing - and the results are very strange

Their  Chinese owner says she has been flooded with offers to buy the three puppies

She said: 'I won't sell them yet anyway, they are still too young.

'It is really remarkable the resemblance they have to pandas, especially when you put them next to some bamboo although they don't seem to like eating it very much unlike the real giant pandas.'  

She added that she was keen to see whether the dogs might have offspring that looked similar, and joked that the panda look could soon become the next pedigree breed.
