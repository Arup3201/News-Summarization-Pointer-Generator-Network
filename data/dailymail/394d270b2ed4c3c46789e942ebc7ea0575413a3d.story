It's not just humans that are to blame for global warming - natural activity from the sun also has an impact on climate change. 

This is according to a Swedish research team that has reconstructed the sun's activity at the end of the last ice age, around 20,000 to 10,000 years ago.

The study shows that the sun's variation influences the climate regardless of whether the climate is extreme, as it was during the Ice Age, or moderate, as it is today.

Researchers in Sweden have, for the first time, shown how solar activity affected the last ice age 20,000 to 10,000 years ago. They say the sun influences the climate regardless of whether it is extremely cold or more moderate like today

However the researchers do not say solar 
activity is the sole cause of the current warming of our planet, which 
most scientists agree is being accelerated by human activities.

The researchers from Lund University in Sweden came to their conclusion by analysing trace elements in ice cores in Greenland and cave formations from China. 

Europe: The IPCC expects damage to the Mediterranean. This will increase energy costs and damage tourism from 2050.

North America: Flooding will be a major threat in this area with rain and storms moving north of New York.

Asia: The majority of the people directly affected by sea level rise will be in southern and eastern Asia.

Australasia: There remains uncertainty about impact in Australasia, but extreme weather is predicted.

Africa: Food security will be a major issue for Africa. Crops and livestock will be affected by both flooding and drought.

Central and South America: Scientists expect Northern Brazil may lose 22 per cent of its annual rainfall by 2100.

Their research shows that the regional climate is influenced by the sun and offers opportunities to better predict future climate conditions in certain regions.

Dr Raimund Muscheler, lecturer in Quaternary Geology at Lund University and co-author of the study, told MailOnline that solar activity in the modern day was causing about 0.1 degrees of warming in the 11-year solar cycle.

'Bit it's quite debated how much it really contributed in the last 100 years, since solar activity increased a bit,' Dr Muscheler says.

'The long trend is debated, but most people don't think it's much more than 0.1 degrees.'

However, he warned that the sun was not the only factor in causing climate change.

'Climate skeptics like to say sun is causing more global
warming than we think but I don’t
think so.

'What our paper shows is we need to include all processes - greenhouses, the sun and so on, especially for local climates which is
important of course.

During the last glacial maximum, Sweden was covered in a thick ice sheet that stretched all the way down to northern Germany and sea levels were more than 330ft (100m) lower than they are today, because the water was frozen in the extensive ice caps.

'The study shows an unexpected link between solar activity and climate change,' Dr Muscheler said in a press release.

'It shows both that changes in solar activity are nothing new and that solar activity influences the climate, especially on a regional level. 

'Understanding these processes helps us to better forecast the climate in certain regions.'

Dr Joanna Haigh, Professor of Atmospheric Physics at Imperial College London, tells MailOnline that the research is interesting but people should not jump to any conclusions.

'This is a very nice careful piece of work which provides evidence from Greenland, over a period 10,000-25,000 years ago, consistent with a picture that has emerged from other studies looking at changes over more recent times,' she says.

'This shows that when the sun is less active winters are likely to be warmer in Greenland and colder in Northwest Europe.

'It is not easy to draw any conclusions from this work with regard to the sun’s role in global warming or the recent slowdown in warming of global air temperature.'

The study claims that that sun could be influencing climate change today. However they do not say the sun is the only factor in climate change. Most scientists agree human activity is causing the planet to warm faster

The sun’s impact on the climate is a matter of current debate.

There is still a lot of uncertainty as to how the sun affects the climate, but the study suggests that direct solar energy is not the most important factor, but rather it indirectly affects atmospheric circulation.

'Reduced solar activity could lead to colder winters in Northern Europe,' said Dr Muscheler.

'This is because the sun’s UV radiation affects the atmospheric circulation. 

'Interestingly, the same processes lead to warmer winters in Greenland, with greater snowfall and more storms. 

'The study also shows that the various solar processes need to be included in climate models in order to better predict future global and regional climate change.'
