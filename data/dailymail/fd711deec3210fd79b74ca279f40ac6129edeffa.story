A one-legged drugs trafficker was caught by customs officials in Spain, who found more than a kilo of cocaine stashed in his false limb.

Police at the airport in Madrid became suspicious of the man and an accomplice when they arrived on a flight from Panama on Sunday looking nervous.

'It was just a hunch but one based on experience,' said one official.

'When we searched them we found two bags of cocaine taped inside one of the suspect's prosthetic leg,' they added.

Both men from Peru have been held on drugs trafficking charges.

In an incident on June 4 at the same airport, an airport employee and a passenger arriving from Peru were both arrested for trying to smuggle 10kilos of cocaine.

The problem with cocaine smuggling has been an ongoing struggle for Spanish authorities.

In March, 55 kilos of cocaine were uncovered in the luggage of three passengers who arrived on a flight from Lima.

Last year, police detained 398 people at Barajas airport for drug smuggling.

It is particularly difficult for authorities at the airport as over 45 million passengers passed through last year.
