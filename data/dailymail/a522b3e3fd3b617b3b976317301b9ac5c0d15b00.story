When it comes to bottoms, it seems British women have decided that bigger is definitly better.

A Harley Street clinic has announced a boom in the number of procedures for fat transfers to plump up the buttocks, as women strive to emulate Kim Kardashian's curvaceous figure.

The Private Clinic in London has seen the number of women opting to enhance the size of their bottoms triple in just one year.

The procedure involves injecting the derriere area with fat taken from another part of the body, such as the flanks, stomach or 
thighs, making their behind fuller, more lifted and enhanced.

New statistics from an online fitness and 
slimming site reveal most women desire the body of celebrities famous 
for their big bottoms, such as Kardashian and Kelly Brook.

So it's no surprise they are opting to transform their shape and make themselves more curvy.

The Private Clinic in Harley Street carried out three times as many fat transfer to the buttocks procedures in 2013 than it did in 2012.

The procedure is sought both by women who feel this area of their body has sagged or lost volume but also, most commonly, by women who would prefer their buttocks to appear larger or fuller.

Women typically get fat sucked out of their flanks, stomach or thighs and injected into their buttocks

Dr Dennis Wolf, Joint Medical Director 
and fat transfer specialist at The Private Clinic of Harley Street, 
said: 'Fat transfer to the buttocks has undoubtedly become one of the 
more commonly requested treatments that I perform at The Private Clinic.

'Of all the fat transfer procedures I performed in 2012, 11 per cent of these were to the buttocks. In 2013, however, close to 20 per cent of fat transfer procedures I carried out were to the buttocks - a significant increase in a fairly short space of time.'

Unlike with buttock implants, fat transfer to the buttocks is delivered under local anaesthetic and conscious sedation.

The walk-in, walk-out procedure removes the requirement for general anaesthetic or a hospital stay for the patient. 

Dr Wolf continued: 'The relatively shorter recovery time involved in this procedure certainly makes it more appealing to many patients.

'For most women, taking long periods of time away from work to rest is simply not possible, and so the ability to undergo the procedure, leave the clinic on the same day, and return to their day-to-day activities very quickly is a huge benefit.'

Kelly Brook's curvaceous body is also envied by many women

He continued: 'But I believe the procedure is also growing in popularity because of an increased awareness of the benefits and the capabilities of fat, when used to enhance or rejuvenate areas on the body.

'Fat is an entirely autologous tissue from the patient's own body. This means that it is a safe, reliable and natural substance. The possibility of rejection is, therefore, incredibly low too.

'Fat is also a very effective filler because of the longevity of results that can be achieved. In the majority of fat transfer to the buttocks procedures, the patient's buttocks will continue to appear fuller for up to 5 years, making this a long-term option.' 

According to a recent survey by online fitness and slimming firm DesirableBody.co.uk, the most desired celebrity body of 2013 was that of Kelly Brook, closely followed by Kim Kardashian. 

The survey, which asked women across the UK whose figure in the celebrity world they desired the most, revealed that the bodies of Kelly and Kim, perhaps most famous for their beautiful big bottoms, were lusted-after far and above the leaner figures of the likes of Cara Delevingne or Victoria Beckham.

A report 
out this week from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons
 (BAAPS) revealed that the number of women who underwent any variety of 
fat transfer procedures in 2013 across all clinics in Britain rose by 15
 per cent, compared with the previous year.

Fat
 transfer, a process by which fat is removed from one area of the body 
and injected into another, can be used to enhance or rejuvenate 
different parts of the body, including the face, breasts, hands and 
buttocks.

And while, 
to date, the procedure has most commonly been used for breast 
enhancement purposes - as a natural alternative to breast implants - 
the number of women seeking the treatment as a means of filling and 
enhancing their buttocks is rising rapidly.
