A schoolboy has been withdrawn from lessons after his father refused to cut off his son's three-inch ponytail.

Connor Wallwork, 11, has sported the unusual hairstyle since he was a toddler, but has now been told by staff at Westhoughton High in Bolton that it breaches their strict uniform code.

The pupil, who had just started at the Greater Manchester secondary school, was told he'd have to be taught in a classroom on his own until he had it cut.

Against school policy: Connor Wallwork has been banned from lessons until he cuts off his ponytail

Now the boy's father has claimed that
the school is infringing his son's human rights and has withdrawn the 
youngster from classes.

Geoff
Wallwork, 46, said: 'He's had the ponytail since he was a toddler, it 
is natural to him. It would be like cutting someone's finger off. I've 
spoken to the head and he says it's got to come off.

'They asked me if it is a 
religious thing. It's not but it is what my son believes. 'It's all 
right for girls but not for lads, it's infringement of human rights.Â 

'No one else has complained about it,
he's not hurting anyone and it's not distracting him or anyone else in 
lessons. If he had a pink Mohican I could understand it, but it's just a
small pony tail.'

Unfair: The schoolboy's father insists making Connor learn at home breaches his human rights

A member of the school's pastoral 
team visited Mr Wallwork and Connor on Monday to try to resolve the 
issue.

The youngster has spent just four days at his new school since 
leaving Eatock Primary School.

Headteacher
Phil Hart said: 'The school has a clear uniform code which covers 
uniform and hairstyles.

'This is published to all our parents and carers 
and is part of the student planner.

Bosses at Westhoughton High in Bolton said the hairstyle does not follow their strict uniform code

'We
ask for the support of all parents and carers in supporting our high 
standards and ensuring the uniform code is followed by every student.'

Mr Wallwork has now asked the school to send work home for his son.

Connor added: 'I've only been in school four days. I like my hair the way it is and don't want to have it cut.

'School has been all right apart from the problem with my hair, but it has upset me a bit.'
