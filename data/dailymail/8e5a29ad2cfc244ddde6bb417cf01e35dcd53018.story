A mother from the New South Wales north coast has told how she found out about her 14-year-old daughter's suicide on Facebook.

Donna Rathborne's biological daughter Karmah Jayne Hall killed herself in early September at her foster carer's property at Kenthurst in north-western Sydney.

In an interview with the ABC, Ms Rathborne said authorities did not tell her what had happened to her daughter.

Instead, her other daughter stumbled upon the news when she spotted a disturbing message on her Facebook page.

Tragedy: Karmah Jayne Hall, 14, committed suicide in early September

Hall was just weeks away from turning 15-years-old at the time she died

Relatives of Karmah, including birth mother Donna Rathborne (left), said they were devastated by how they learned of her death

'My daughter Kate rang me and said, "Mum, I've just seen on Facebook, Rest In Peace, Karmah",' Ms Rathborne told the broadcaster. 

'I said no, that's not right.... We're not just some other people, we are her family.' 

Authorities did not initially share the news with Ms Rathborne, however, the family eventually confirmed Karmah's death through her school, Galston High.

'They already had counsellors at school for the kids, but not for me. And not her sisters and her brother,' Ms Rathborne told the ABC.

Karmah was taken away from her birth mother when she was a baby because Ms Rathborne's partner was violent. She kept in contact with her child.

'We're not just some other people, we are her family,' Ms Rathborne said

A tribute Facebook page featuring artwork and videos has been set up in Karmah's honour. 

'So beautiful... so full of life,' one friend wrote. 'So loved and missed,' said another. 

A friend described the teenager as 'beautiful and carefree'. 

Dozens of colourful balloons were released into the sky in the teenager's honour as a final send off.

Karmah would have turned 15-years-old just weeks after her death.

Daily Mail Australia has approached Ms Rathborne for further comment.
