Marion 'Suge' Knight had a long-standing 'beef' with the man he is charged with attempting to murder by mowing him down in his truck, Daily Mail Online can reveal.

Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 51, was knocked unconscious and has a 'mangled' foot after the collision last week, an incident which saw music producer Terry Carter, 55, killed.

And the actor and filmmaker – who has been employed as a consultant on hit movies such as Training Day - fears his injuries could bring his career to an abrupt end.

Sloan is furious that Knight allegedly 'went ballistic' after a row erupted on the set of the film 'Straight Outta Compton, a production about the rise of the rap group N.W.A.

Victim: Cle Shaheed 'Bone' Sloan suffered a 'mangled foot' when he was hit by Marion 'Suge' Knight's truck in an incident which also killed Terry Carter, another acquaintance of the hip-hop mogul

Death Row Records founder Suge Knight (pictured on Tuesday) was rushed to the hospital with a panic attack minutes after pleading not guilty to murdering his friend and attempting to kill another man in a hit-and-run 

Sloan had worked hard to convince rap legend and music producer Dr Dre to come to Compton to be involved in the film.

But a source close to Sloan said Knight ruined the 'beautiful' moment by sparking a heated row.

'There was a long-standing beef. This guy [Sloan] grew up with Suge Knight, he grew up with Dr Dre, he grew up with all these guys, most of whom left and went to live in the gated communities.

'He's always been a big supporter of Compton, he's a shining example of a kid who was a gang guy himself but who has become an accomplished artist.

'So when they were doing this filming, Dr Dre had always been too afraid to go back, but Bone brought him back and he was signing autographs for the kids.

'It was a beautiful moment and this idiot showed up in his truck and went ballistic.'

The source says Sloan is now out of the hospital and is staying at a 'secure' location through fear of reprisals.

'Cle is somewhere safe with security around him because there is some concern about retaliation,' the source said.

'He comes from that world, he knows this stuff can go down.'

The source says Sloan has 'got a ways to go' before he makes a full recovery and was shocked by what happened.

'His foot was pretty mangled in the incident, it looks pretty grotesque to look at,' the source said

'He was unconscious too, he's not up running around, he's gonna be on his back for a long time.

'He's got a ways to go, he will have to go through some rehab to get back on his feet.

'He's still in shock at what happened. Cle is not a fly by night guy, he's a serious player.

Terry Carter, 55, left, died in the incident. He was struck at least twice by Marion 'Suge' Knight's truck, according to police 

'This guy could be the next Spike Lee, he's talked about as a sort of Renaissance man from the hood.

'He was trying to elevate the image of Compton so

he's sad that this went down.'

Knight is accused of intentionally running down two men, including a friend, outside a Compton burger bar on Thursday after an argument on the movie set.

The collision killed his friend Carter, a founder and owner of Heavyweight Records who was viewed as a local father figure and tried to help mentor young men in the community, said Doug Young, a friend and hip-hop music promoter.

However, Knight's attorney James Blatt has said the collision was an accident that occurred as Knight was trying to flee an altercation in which he was assaulted.

On Monday, prosecutors charged Knight with killing Carter and attempting to kill Sloan.

Knight also faces two charges of hit-and-run.

In addition, Knight's $2 million bail was revoked after a court commissioner agreed with authorities that he was a potential flight risk and could intimidate witnesses.

The ruling came after homicide detectives told the bail commissioner that Knight could face a lengthy prison sentence because of a violent criminal past, said Los Angeles County sheriff's spokeswoman Nicole Nishida.

Knight was out on bail in a separate robbery case when the men were hit.

Authorities said Knight visited the set for 'Straight Outta Compton' and argued with Sloan, who was working at the location on Thursday.

Sheriff's deputies providing security asked Knight to leave.

A short time afterward, the argument resumed in a parking lot a few miles away where Knight and Sloan exchanged punches through a window of the pickup before the two men were run down, authorities said.

Blatt has said Knight was attacked by four people, including Sloan, as he pulled into the parking lot after Carter requested he show up for a meeting. Blatt said Knight hit the gas and fled in fear.

After Tuesday's arraignment, Knight was rushed to the hospital with a panic attack minutes after pleading not guilty to murdering his friend and attempting to kill Sloan.

The incident came less than six months after Knight was shot six times at a West Hollywood nightclub in August — the second shooting he's survived.

No arrests have been made.

At 6-foot-4 and weighing 325 pounds, Knight has, 49, a reputation as an imposing figure that is credited, in part, with helping create Death Row Records when he strong-armed another label to release Dr. Dre from his contract, said Chuck Creekmur, CEO of allhiphop.com.

Knight is the founder of Death Row Records, which worked with Tupac Shakur (Knight and the rapper pictured above in August 19996 file photo) in the last months of his life

Knight was at the center of one of the most notorious rap conflicts of the 1990s, pitting Tupac Shakur against Biggie Smalls in an East Coast-versus-West Coast rivalry.

Knight was sent to prison for nearly five years for badly beating a rival with Shakur at a Las Vegas hotel, just hours before Shakur was fatally shot while riding in Knight's car just east of the Strip.

Smalls, whose real name was Chris Wallace, was shot to death in a similar attack six months later.

Knight and Dre later had a falling out, and Dre left. The record company eventually declared bankruptcy and was auctioned off.

Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, another former N.W.A. member, were at the film location Thursday, but they didn't see Knight.

In November, Knight pleaded not guilty to a robbery charge filed after a celebrity photographer accused him of stealing her camera in Beverly Hills. Because of prior convictions, he could face up to 30 years in prison.

At Tuesday's arraignment, the initial judge assigned opted to recuse himself because he had represented both victims in the case in his years as an attorney.

Judge Ricardo Ocampo took over the case.

The District Attorney's Office said Knight was out on bail in a pending robbery case when the alleged hit-and-run occurred.

A new bail hearing was set for February 9 and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for February 19.

Knight's bail hearing was scheduled for next Monday. He is now being held in jail without bail.

Knight was at the center of one of the most notorious rap conflicts of the 1990s, pitting Tupac Shakur against Biggie Smalls in an East Coast-West Coast rivalry.

He was sent to prison for nearly five years for badly beating a rival with Shakur at a Las Vegas hotel, just hours before Shakur was fatally shot while riding in Knight's car just east of the Strip in 1996.

After yesterday's court appearance, the 49-year-old, who glanced back into the gallery several times, was taken to hospital after suffering a panic attack, reports TMZ. 

Law enforcement sources said he was in the lockup area next to the courtroom when he began experiencing chest pains and he was taken to hospital via an ambulance. 

The former rap music mogul pleaded not guilty to murder, attempted murder and other charges filed.

However, his attorney James Blatt has said the collision was an accident that occurred as Knight was trying to flee an altercation in which he was assaulted.
