George Osborne said anyone caught fiddling markets will now face ‘the full force of the law’

Traders caught rigging foreign exchange markets will face up to seven years behind bars under plans confirmed today by Chancellor George Osborne.

The new rules, which come into force in April, come just a month after six banks were fined £2.6billion for rigging foreign exchange for profit.

Mr Osborne said anyone caught fiddling markets will now face ‘the full force of the law’.

The clampdown come on top of rules introduced last year to tackle the manipulation of the interest rate used by banks to lend to each other – known as Libor.

From next year traders will face criminal charges if they are caught fiddling a host of ‘benchmark’ rates, which are traded around the world, including gold, silver and Brent crude oil prices.

It comes after the Chancellor set out plans to introduce criminal sanctions to clean up the forex market in his Mansion House speech in June.

Mr Osborne said today: ‘The integrity of the City matters to the economy of Britain.

‘Ensuring that the key rates that underpin financial markets here and around the world are robust, and that anyone who seeks to manipulate them is subject to the full force of the law, is an important part of our long-term economic plan.

‘That’s why the Government is determined to deal with abuses, tackle the unacceptable behaviour of the few and ensure that markets are fair for the many who depend on them.’

The Treasury said the changes announced today would extend the criminal offence applied to any person guilty of manipulating a ‘relevant benchmark’, which was originally introduced for Libor.

Those who administrate the benchmarks and submit figures used in their calculation will also be subject to proposed new FCA rules with firms facing financial penalties, suspensions or censure for breaking them.

Key requirements include identifying potential manipulation, controlling conflicts of interest and implementing robust governance and oversight, the watchdog said.

The new rules, which come into force in April, come just a month after six banks were fined £2.6billion for rigging foreign exchange for profit. 

FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley said: ‘I am determined to ensure that markets work well and preserve the UK’s reputation as a centre of excellence for financial services - today’s announcement is a vital step in achieving this.

‘This builds on our work to strengthen Libor, and drive up standards on benchmarks across the board.’
