Doting uncle Prince Harry revealed tonight that he had just seen baby Prince George smile for the first time.

Speaking at the WellChild Awards, where he paid tribute to brave children battling serious illness, the royal’s face lit up when he spoke about his seven-week old nephew.

He told one nominee, Nikki Christou, nine, from Enfield, North London, that he had just seen young George at Kensington Palace after travelling back from Norfolk with Prince William where they had attended the burial of their close family friend Hugh van Cutsem this afternoon.

He beamed when Nikki told him that she shared the royal baby's July 22 birthday, her dad was called George, and her brother Alexander - one of the baby's middle names.

'Wow, very, very weird," Harry said. 'I've just literally seen him. Normally when I see him he's either sleeping or crying but I've just seen him smile. It was the first time I've seen him smile.'

Nikki, who has an incurable malformation in her face that has affected her nose, cheekbone and right eye, was one of several children who charmed the fourth in line to the throne at the ninth annual WellChild Awards at the Dorchester Hotel in London.

Dressed in a tuxedo and dickie bow, little Jonathan He, six, from Milton Keynes, stole the show by by performing a song called I Dig My Garden for Harry.

Jonathan, who has a rare genetically 
inherited immune condition and glaucoma, told the Prince how he learned 
to cook while unable to eat food for six months.

Harry,
wearing a navy suit, white shirt and pale blue patterned tie, was asked
by Madison Kirk, six: 'What's it like to be a Prince?'

Harry replied diplomatically: 'Good and bad.'

He
seemed unimpressed when Laughlan Dougall, 11, from Cambuslang, Glasgow,
told him he supported Scottish football giants Celtic.

Laughlan, who has undergone more than
50 brain operations, asked the Prince to close his eyes and then put a 
Tam o' Shanter with ginger wig on his head. 'I've already got one of 
these. Now I've got two,' said Harry.

At the end of the ceremony, Harry delivered a short speech, which he gave confidently and without notes.

Delighted: Alexander Read, 14, attended the ceremony with sister Eleanor and mum Shirley

He
described the award winners as 'unbelievably brave' and said: 'I'm 
hugely humbled to be patron of WellChild and I count myself incredibly 
lucky to be patron, as well as coming down here this evening.

'It's
always so clear for everyone to see how brave and inspirational the 
children are, but very easy to forget what a huge effect it has on the 
parents, nurses and all the family.'

He
said for those 'not as brave' as the children, who are older and 'quite
grey and wrinkly', that: 'It means so much to us, to see what you can 
do.

'It reminds us of all the things we take for granted. It puts us back in our box.'

He
said it was a 'privilege' to meet the children and hear their stories, 
and added: 'The more help that this charity gets, the better. It stands 
way above the rest as far as I'm concerned with all the work it does.'

A royal spokesman confirmed Harry had spent time with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at Kensington Palace earlier today.

The
Prince joined a host of celebrities including Rod Stewart, Pixie Lott, 
Ainsley Harriott, Karren Brady, and Duncan Bannatyne at the glittering 
awards ceremony.
