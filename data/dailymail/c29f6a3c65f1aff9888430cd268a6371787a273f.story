This is the best that London's skyline has to offer - in 16 outstanding panoramic photographs of the capital as you've never seen it before.

Graham Charlie Edwards took the spectacular pictures from a mixture of public spots and private flats, from the City to Primrose Hill, for a new book.

It features what could be the best view from any London home - the one enjoyed by Jeffrey Archer, from his Albert Embankment penthouse.

North from Bankside: The Millenium Bridge and St Paul's Cathedral - which is on Ludgate Hill, the City of London's highest point

East from Waterloo Bridge: Photographer Graham Charles Edwards says this is widely regarded as the finest street-level view in London

East from Aldwych: The Leadenhall Building (centre left), or 'Cheesegrater' and 20 Fenchurch Street, or 'The Walkie-Talkie' (centre right)

South from Tower Hill: Tower Bridge (right), built in 1894, and the Tower of London, which has parts dating back nearly 1,000 years

The view from Lord Archer’s multi-million pound flat next the River Thames takes in the likes of Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament and the London Eye.

Mr Edwards, 52, of Knightsbridge, told MailOnline: ‘I noticed him talking in his apartment, and he likes to sit on a sofa with that view behind him.

‘I dropped off a mock-up of my book before it was printed, and asked him, “do you think I could come up and take a view from your penthouse”?

‘To my astonishment he agreed. I waited for a good day, and I went up there and I spent an amazing hour taking pictures. He's got a 360-degree view.

‘When I had the book printed, I sent a copy to him - and he asked me for three more, which he bought from me. If you don't ask, you don’t get.’

The penthouse owned by Lord Archer - who has bought three copies of Mr Edwards's book - is on a peninsula giving stunning views along the river.

Mr Edwards has been working on the book of panoramic photographs for five years, and spoke to various people about gaining access to their flats.

Six of the images were taken from private homes, with Mr Edwards wanting to study rare views of the London skyline that the public cannot usual see.

Other views featured in the book include looking east from Battersea, north from Greenwich and south from Primrose Hill.

Lord Archer, 74, is notorious for being jailed for four years in 2001 after being found guilty of perjury and perverting the course of justice.

His apartment is in a building which has an average flat value of £2.8million. The book, London Vistas, is available for £25 by clicking here.
