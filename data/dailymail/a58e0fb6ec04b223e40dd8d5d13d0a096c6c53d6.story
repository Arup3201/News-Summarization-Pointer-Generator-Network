A new U.S. counterintelligence agency joined
Twitter on Monday, just hours before news of the hacking of U.S.
military Twitter and YouTube accounts.

'The National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC)
joins Twitter...we've said too much already!' tweeted the agency
in its inaugural posting.

As of late Monday afternoon, the new NCSC Twitter account had amassed more than 1,200 followers. 

The agency was formed late last year by U.S. Director of
National Intelligence James Clapper 'to effectively integrate
and align counterintelligence and security mission areas, and
carry out counterintelligence and security responsibilities
under a single organizational construct.'

Just hours after the NCSC's inaugural tweet, Pentagon
officials revealed that social media feeds for U.S. Central Command had
been hacked by people claiming sympathy with the Islamic State
militant group being targeted in American bombing raids.

Central Command oversees U.S. military operations in the
Middle East. U.S. officials said its Twitter feed and
YouTube accounts were suspended after being compromised. 

The social media accounts of CentCom in Florida were apparently hacked by ISIS sympathizers who posted threatening messages against troops, their families and the home addresses of 4-star US generals.

The security breach, which occurred while President Obama was giving a speech on cyber security, also saw war game scenarios for conflicts with North Korean and Iran leaked online.
