Grilled: Outgoing NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson

Sir David Nicholson should step down immediately for ‘misleading’ parliament about the scandal  surrounding gagging clauses, MPs said yesterday.

The outgoing chief executive of the NHS was grilled yesterday about revelations that at least 52 staff have been silenced by law and handed £2million in secret severance payments.

Unlike other payoffs to gag health workers – of which hundreds have been handed out in recent years – the so-called judicial mediation deals were agreed by hospital trusts without Treasury or Department of Health scrutiny.

One for £500,000 was handed to whistleblower Gary Walker, the former head of United Lincolnshire Hospital NHS Trust, where hundreds of patients are feared to have died.

He broke his silence earlier this year to tell of ‘dangerous’ conditions and a bullying management culture.

In a combative session of the public accounts committee yesterday, MPs challenged Sir David’s claim three months ago that he thought Mr Walker was an isolated case.

The NHS boss admitted he had not checked how many had been handed out since he was ordered to by Parliament three months ago.

‘I didn’t... maybe I should have,’ he said. Requests for data under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that at least 52 payoff deals were agreed at 38 hospitals in England. Dozens more hospitals did not reply.

But the embattled health service boss, who has already agreed to step down from his £210,000-a-year job next year following the Mid Staffordshire scandal where up to 1,200 patients died needlessly, denied there had been a ‘cover up’.

Sir David accepted the use of gagging clauses was ‘not acceptable’.

He admitted their use was ‘widespread’ in the health service and the private sector and said they did not all apply to people raising safety concerns.

In a rambling defence to MPs, he claimed he had always tried to support whistleblowers in the NHS and said: ‘I can absolutely refute that I have ever been involved in any kind of cover-up in relation to the expenditure that’s identified.

‘I have been absolutely honest and truthful with this committee... I have always supported people who have stood out against the system.’

Gary Walker, former chief executive of the United Lincolnshire hospitals NHS trust, was paid £500,000 to go quietly

Sir David tried to blame the  
Treasury, saying it had told the NHS by letter in 2011 that no approval 
was needed for payoffs under so-called judicial mediation.

A hapless Treasury official then hold
how ‘there was confusion as to what judicial mediation meant’ in his 
department and they ‘did not understand it’.

Margaret Hodge, chairman of the 
committee, said she was ‘gobsmacked’ that the payments were agreed with 
no scrutiny. She said Sir David’s failure to disclose how many had been 
made was ‘impertinent’.

Northampton General Hospital paid a total of £145,000 to two whistleblowers

MP Steve Barclay, whose Freedom of 
Information request uncovered the figures, revealed that between 2008 
and 2011 there were 598 ‘special severance payments’ costing 
£14.7million – not including the 52 judicial mediation payments.

They include two consultants at 
Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals, who were paid £300,000 and 
£265,000 respectively in February – a month before Sir David assured MPs
Mr Walker was an isolated case.

Mr Barclay, Tory member for North 
East Cambridgeshire, said it ‘stretches credulity’ that Sir David did 
not know about the payments and called for him to step down now. ‘He 
should have immediately sought to investigate,’ he said.

‘It is a clear conflict of interest 
for a hospital, where a member of staff has raised concerns, to use 
taxpayers money to pay people off with no external scrutiny.

‘That does not include payments while they were suspended and potentially massive legal fees, so it’s the tip of the iceberg.

‘When asked to investigate, Sir David agreed to do so as soon as possible and failed to.

Either he didn’t know when he should have or he’s misled parliament. I 
think he should do the honourable thing now and step down.’

Sir David was accused in Parliament earlier this year of presiding over a ‘see no evil, hear no evil’ culture in the NHS.

He claimed he had ‘no idea’ about the
unfolding disaster in Mid Staffordshire, ‘no access’ to published 
statistics revealing high death rates and did not know the extent of 
gagging orders.

Articles
in June about secret severance payments to NHS staff said that two 
consultants at the Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals NHS 
Foundation Trust were paid ‘hush money’. We are happy to clarify that 
while the consultants in question were paid £300,000 and £265000, they 
were not asked to sign gagging orders and continue to work for the 
trust.
