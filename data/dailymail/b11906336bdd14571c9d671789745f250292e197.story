An arctic cruise is trying to appeal to the literary set by holding a 'floating book club' on the trip. 

Travel company Adventure Canada has lined up three authors to present their work on a 13-day voyage this summer, with prices starting at $5,000 per person.

Kathleen Winter, who wrote the 2011 novel, Annabel -- set in a small coastal town in Labrador -- is one of the authors that will join passengers aboard the Ocean Endeavour that sets sail on July 5.

Triple-bill: The 13-day cruise is hosted by Canadian superstar authors Doug Gibson, Kathleen Winter and Terry Fallis

Setting sail to sell: Terry Fallis will present the first of his four national bestselling books on the cruise

The cruise will visit parts of Labrador, as well as the remote Newfoundland – perfect for spotting whales, polar bears and seals. 

The two other authors include Doug Gibson, who wrote Stories About Storytellers, and Terry Fallis, a novelist best known for his political satire called The Best Laid Plans. 

And with 24 hours of daylight during the Arctic summer months, the 198 passengers will have plenty of time to read each book. 

Though, some have suggested that it is not actually necessary to read the books in order to enjoy the cruise. 

During the cruise, passengers will be able to talk with the authors about books, as well as the culture and the history of the northern Canada ports of call.  

A brief look through their synopses and reviews on Amazon will soon have you chatting as though you were a seasoned bookworm.

The Ocean Endeavor leaves from Saint Pierre, an island that became a French outpost. Then it's on to the south coast of Newfoundland and the mountains and fjords of Gros Morne National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site.

Stops will also be made in Labrador including Red Bay, Mealy Mountains National Park Reserve and the Inuit homeland Nunatsiavut. 

The trip ranges in price from $4,995 to $16,195 per person depending on the category of cabin, not including commercial airfare and the $995/pp charter flights to St. John's, Newfoundland and Kuujjuaq, Quebec where the cruise ends on July 17.
