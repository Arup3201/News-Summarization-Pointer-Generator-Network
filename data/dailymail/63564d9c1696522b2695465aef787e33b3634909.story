Sandra McDonald spent a lifetime searching for the mother who gave her up for adoption at only a few days old, only tragically to find that she was too late, and her mother had died in 2002.

Despite this devastating news, Sandra, from Edinburgh, gained two half-sisters and an aunt through her quest to find the mother who left a hole in her childhood.

‘Even at a young age I felt there was something missing,’ Sandra explains, ‘I was only able five or six and I remember going out into the street and shouting for my real mum.

‘It’s like something is missing in my heart and soul. I just want a cuddle from her.’

Adopted in 1961, Sandra was the only child of her adoptive parents, Jemima and Donald. Growing up Sandra felt she was treated coldly by her adoptive parents. Despite doing anything she could to gain their acceptance, she always felt she simply didn’t belong. From a young age Sandra pined for her birth mother. As a teenager the strain on the relationship with her adoptive parents only grew and at fifteen Sandra decided that she needed to find her biological mum.

‘it was a very cold relationship, but I think as a child you try your best to think “this will help them to love me more”. You do well at school, your room is clean, you do as your told and everything but it doesn’t work like that. 

At age just 15 and struggling with her adoptive parents, Sandra began her search for her birth mother, knowing only that she had been in the care of a church-run mother and baby home.

‘I went to the offices and I thought because they were religious there would be some compassion there. The man was so rude it was unbelievable, saying “your mother sinned abominably and she doesn’t want to be reminded of the sins she’s committed and she has to move forward”

‘I felt so sorry for my mum. I thought if he’s like that with me what an earth has he been like with her. Id never felt anger like that in my life before- it made me more determined to find my mum.’

At age 18 Sandra gained access to her adoption file and discovered her mother was called Mrs Elizabeth Blair, recording a maiden name of Anderson.

Sandra spent years searching, contacting hundreds of women with her mother’s name but to no avail.

‘I’ve always felt there was that strong connection between us from the heart and that’s what‘s kept me going.’

When ITV’s Long Lost Family took on the search they discovered that Sandra’s mother had died in 2002. They did however discover two daughters – and Sandra’s half sisters- Elizabeth Hall and Loraine Rennie.

‘I’m glad she was happy and went on to have more children. But it’s a shock finding out my mum is dead and now I have all these siblings , having been an only child.’

The two girls had never been told about Sandra growing up and it was only after their mother’s death that the secret came out when their aunt, Ina Haque, told them.

The trio et for the first time at the Wallace monument in Stirling – one of their mother’s favourite places.

‘I felt my heart flip. That is really my sisters sitting there.’

Two weeks later, Sandra traveled to Mansfield and, in an emotional meeting is reunited with her aunt.

Ina Haque, who lives in Mansfield recounts the pain that her sister experienced when she gave up her daughter for adoption.

‘Me and my mother went to visit her in the home, and she came to the window and held the baby up for us to see, and her face was all red from crying. I just knew she was going through an awful, awful time,' Ina recalls.

Despite not being able to meet her mother, being reunited with her aunt and half-sisters has given Sandra a sense of comfort.

‘I felt we had all just connected like a chain that had been broken and we were all back together again.’
