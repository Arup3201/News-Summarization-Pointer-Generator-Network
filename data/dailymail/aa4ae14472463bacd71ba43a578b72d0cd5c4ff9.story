Andrew Morris, 47, was so badly injured in the prolonged assault in his home last November that the detective who led the inquiry said he was lucky not to have died

The leader of a gratuitous, sustained attack who broke every bone in his victim’s face was jailed indefinitely today.

Andrew Morris, 47, was so badly injured in the prolonged assault in his home in Darlington, County Durham, last November that the detective who led the inquiry said he was lucky not to have died.

Ringleader Sean O’Brien, 23, was told he would not be released until it was safe for the public when he was sentenced at Teesside Crown Court today.

Co-accused Paul Lodey, 42, was jailed for five years and four months and Victoria Blakey, 32, for four years and eight months.

All four were drinking at Mr Morris’s home - where he let his friend Blakey stay while she was homeless - when O’Brien, her boyfriend, started to attack him.

Paul Newcombe, prosecuting, said Mr Morris was left with 'severe and sickening injuries'.

He suffered numerous blows while he was stood and then lying prone on the sofa, the court heard.

When he went upstairs to get out of the way, O’Brien got him in a headlock and dragged him back downstairs to carry on the beating.

The other defendants joined in rather than call the police or intervene to help, the court heard.

Mr Morris suffered fractures to his skull, upper spine, eye-sockets and cheekbones.

Blakey filmed some of the attack on her mobile phone. As he lay unconscious, his wallet was 
stolen.

The group then dragged him outside and pretended he had been 
attacked in the street and that they had come across him as they 
returned from a night out.

They had taken blood-stained sheets from the house in a bid to destroy evidence of the brutal attack.

All three admitted grievous bodily harm and perverting the course of justice, while O’Brien and Lodey pleaded guilty to robbery.

Mr
Morris has since undergone major operations to rebuild his face and had
to move back with his elderly parents Edward and Edith.

Recorder Jonathan Bennett said the trio each played a part in the 'sickening act of gratuitous violence'.

He told O’Brien: 'You pose a high risk of serious harm to the general public.'

Outside court, the victim’s father said: 'It has been heart-breaking.'

His mother added: 'The only time I saw Andrew shed a tear was when I asked him why did they do it and he said "I don’t know".'

Det Sgt Jim Cunningham of Durham Police said Mr Morris could easily have died.

'We consider that Andrew was exceptionally lucky not to have been a murder victim,' he said.

'The worst thing is that Lodey and Blakey were not only friends of Mr Morris but they had ample opportunity to call the police or try to stop this sustained attack.

'That has affected Andrew - the fact that two people he thought he could rely on ended up taking part.'
