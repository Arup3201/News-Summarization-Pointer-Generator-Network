Lindsay Lohan made a quick getaway out of Los Angeles on Tuesday after she was accused of taking thieves  along to a Hollywood Hills home where she partied over the weekend.

However, it seems that relying on her usual mode of transport by flying to her destination of New York, Lindsay had opted to travel by broomstick - judging by the witchy, all-black outfit the actress wore.

Lindsay looked incredibly gothic in a floppy hat, leggings and vest beneath a sheer 
blouse as she touched down in New York with her brother Cody.

The actress' trip comes after she was questioned by police on Monday over jewellery which was reported missing at a multi-million dollar residence Lindsay had partied in over the weekend.

The 26-year old, who has not been 
named a suspect, was implicated by the owner of the home, who believes 
two men Lohan brought with her stole several expensive watches, 
according to TMZ.

According to the website, the owner of the home, who has not been named, invited the actress to the all-night house party.

But a close friend has spoken out in defence of star, claiming the trip was not rushed but had been planned for weeks.

Business associate Claus Hjelmbak told RadarOnline: 'The trip to New York City had been planned for a while and she will be having several work meetings and spending time with her family.

'There was no escaping anything. I had dinner with Lindsay, Dina and her brother Cody, on Monday night at the Viceroy Hotel and she is doing remarkably well and focused on work.'

Lindsay believed to have arrived with her brother Coy, her assistant and the two unnamed gentlemen.

The star is said to have left the 
residence at approximately noon on Monday after police questioning and 
had been 'very cooperative' with law enforcement officers.

Lohan reportedly denied having any involvement with the disappearance of the watches and a pair of sunglasses reported missing.

X17Online
reports detectives from the Los Angeles Police Department also also 
questioned other guests at the residence, spending three hours 
conducting the on-site investigation.

According to the website, the home is owned by a man described as 'a player on the Hollywood social scene' who 'likes to have famous friends'.

The case remains under investigation.

However, this is not the first time Lindsay has been linked to jewellery theft.

Lindsay reportedly told law enforcement officers that she had nothing to do with the missing gems.

The actress was famously charged with shoplifting a necklace from a Venice Beach jewellery store in February last year.

She was charged with misdemenour theft and probation violation, and was sentenced to 120 days in jail and 480 hours of community service.

In addition, she was also ordered to remain under supervision whilst completing all of her community service.

The actress pleaded no contest in court, and was put under house arrest complete with ankle bracelet monitor  due to jail overcrowding.

Lindsay
was then later sentenced to 30 days in jail and 400 hours of community 
service in November, after she was found guilty of violating her 
probation because she failed to perform her community service at a Los 
Angeles morgue.

She entered jail on November 7, 2011, but was released after just under five hours, again due to overcrowding.

The actress finally ended her 
supervised probation in March this year after fulfilling all of her 
community service and therapy requirements.

And despite being involved in a hit and run and car crash earlier this year,Â  has remained relatively out of trouble.

She is currently trying to get her life and career back on track, and recently completed filming Liz & Dick, the Lifetime Elizabeth Taylor biopic, and independent film, The Canyons, written by Bret Easton Ellis and directed by Paul Schrader.
