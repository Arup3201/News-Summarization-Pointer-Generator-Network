Arsenal, Tottenham and Chelsea have all made enquiries for Croatia goal machine Andrej Kramaric.

The HNK Rijeka striker has scored a stunning 27 in 19 games this season for club and country, alerting Premier League sides as well as top clubs in Germany and Italy.

Juventus, AC Milan and Inter have approached Rijeka while Atalanta made an offer only to be told the player had already agreed to join Chelsea on a pre-contract in January.

Rijeka though are contesting that the player has more than six months left on his contract and want to avoid losing him for nothing. They will sell to the highest bidder in January as they look for £8million.

Juventus have already offered £4.5m plus bonuses but a deal has yet to be agreed with the 23-year-old's father. 

Rijeka are hopeful of sparking a bidding war and want to get in the region of £8m for the striker
