Skyscrapers have an 'unhealthy' link with impending financial collapse, according to banking experts.

The news may bring fresh fears to Britain, where the tallest building in Western Europe - The Shard - is nearing completion in London.

Researchers pointed to the fact the world's first skyscraper, New York's Equitable Life building, was finished in 1873 during a five-year recession, while the Empire State Building coincided with the Great Depression.

China could be in particular trouble as the current biggest builder of skyscrapers, responsible for 53 per cent of those now under construction, according to research from Barclays.

India is also at risk, having 14 skyscrapers being built, with only two complete that reach higher than 240m.Â The pattern repeats itself throughout history, with Chicago's Willis Tower (formerly known as the Sears Tower) built in 
1974, just as there was an oil shock.

One World Trade Centre in 1972 and Two World Trade Centre the year after came at this time of U.S. currency speculation and worldwide financial crisis.

Construction also began on the new One World Trade Centre, formerly known as Freedom Tower, on Ground Zero in 2008.

Work on the building, which on 
completion next year will become the tallest building in the U.S. at the
 symbolic height of 1,776ft in reference to the year of American 
independence, coincided with the start of the current financial crisis.

Malaysia's Petronas Towers were erected in Kuala Lumpur 1997, at the same time as the Asian financial crisis, while Taipei 101 in Taiwan was finished in 2004, marking the early 2000s recession and the end of the technology bubble.

Even the booming city of Dubai almost went bust at the moment it became host to the tallest edifice on the planet, Burj Khalifa.

Barclays Capital analysts said: 'Often the world's tallest buildings are simply the edifice of a broader 
skyscraper building boom, reflecting a widespread mis-allocation of 
capital and an impending economic correction.

'Investors should therefore pay particular attention to China and India,' they added. Barclays Capital's Skyscraper Index has been published every year since 1999.

It concluded: 'Our Skyscraper Index continues to show an unhealthy correlation between 
construction of the next world's tallest building and an impending 
financial crisis: New York 1930; Chicago 1974; Kuala Lumpur 1997 and 
Dubai 2010.'

The dark portents were supported by a separate report from JPMorgan Chase  cited by the BBC. It warned that the Chinese property 
market could drop by as much as 20 per cent in value in the country's major 
cities within the next 12 to 18 months.
