The Ivory Coast midfielder also singled out Real Madrid's star James Rodriguez, who moved to the Bernabeu from Monaco in the summer for £63million.

'I think definitely [Angel] di Maria and [James] Rodriguez. Rodriguez was a fantastic one, and as well [Manchester] United with the move for [Radamel] Falcao, he is a great striker, unbelievable.'

Toure also spoke highly of former team-mate Alvaro Negredo. The Spaniard returned to his homeland in the summer at Valencia where he made his first appearance for the La Liga side last weekend.

'Of course he has had injury problems, but he has been brilliant for us this last year and I think he will be make a great move.

'We were sad to see him go because he was one of our top strikers in the last year. Of course he had a couple of events and he needed to go back to his country, but I think we are going to miss him a lot.'

Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli has struggled to make an impact at Anfield since arriving for AC Milan 

Liverpool's new signing and good friend of Toure, Mario Balotelli, got a special mention in his top five signings too.

'And the fifth one, I think, one of my great friends, a good friend, Mario Balotelli, like my brother.

'I hope he is going to do well with Liverpool because he has been involved in a few problems in the past year. But I think this year he is coming more mature and he can control all of that.'

Toure has made an indifferent start to the season and will want his City side to respond in the derby on Sunday

Toure was speaking to Nissan, the official automotive sponsor of the UEFA Champions League, as part of his role as the car manufacturer's global ambassador.
