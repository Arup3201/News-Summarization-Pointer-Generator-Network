Jose Mourinho insists that he will be able to keep his second choice keeper happy at Chelsea even though Paris St Germain are ready to move for Petr Cech this week in anticipation of the Chelsea keeper being dropped for the opening match of the club’s season at Burnley.

Mourinho will only reveal his starting line-up on Sunday in training but Mourinho pressed the club to bring Courtois back from his three-year loan spell at Atletico and the Belgian is expected to start at Turf Moor tomorrow.

Paris St Germain want to bring Cech and Chelsea goalkeeping coach, Christophe Lollichon, to the club and if a permanent transfer cannot be agreed they would be prepared to take the player on loan, as it would help them in meeting UEFA’s Financial Fair Play restrictions. 

Dropped: Petr Cech is expected to be dropped for Chelsea's match against Burnley

PSG were ruled to have breached the rules last season and have been forced to limit transfer expenditure.

PSG see Cech as the ideal man to help them as they bid to win the Champions League, deeming him better than current No.1, Italian Salvatore Sirigu. But Mourinho is insistent that he can keep both Courtois and Cech happy and plans to play his second-choice keeper in occasional Premier League and Champions League games to keep him motivated.

Mourinho said: ‘We are Chelsea. We can have two of three best goalkeepers in the world at the club. We can. We are economically stable. . We can have Diego Costa, Didier Drogba and Fernando Torres, so we can have Courtois and Cech. I can have Ramires, Cesc Fabregas, Nemanja Matic and Oscar, yet I cannot have two top goalkeepers?  I can. Chelsea can as a club, and I can as a manager.

Preference: Jose Mourinho said having a strong goalkeeper is the most essential part of the team 

Decisions: Chjelsea have arguably the two best keepers in the league in Cech and Thibaut Courtois

‘There are teams without a good goalkeeper and that’s a big problem and that’s a problem I don’t want to have. In the team, if you ask me: “Tell me the position, the first position where you want to be strong.” I tell you: “Goalkeeper.”

Lollichon would be likely to move with Cech, having worked with him since he played with Rennes in 2002-04 but Mourinho’s assistant manager, Silvino Louro, is also a goalkeeping coach and could fill the gap.

Cech, like Didier Drogba, is likely to have a long-term role at the club when his contract runs out in 2016 but that would still be available to him if he spent time out on-loan for the next two years.

Return: Thibaut Courtois has spent the last three years on loan at Atletico Madrid
