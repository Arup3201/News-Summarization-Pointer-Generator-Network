A retired U.S. Marine whose injuries in Afghanistan have left him partially paralyzed filed a lawsuit claiming that he got a head injury and was soaked in his own urine after being mistreated by personnel at O'Hare International Airport.

Sgt Joseph Smith, a 21-year Army veteran was attacked during his fourth tour of duty in Afghanistan in 2004, leaving him wheelchair-bound for life, according to his wife, Deborah.

Smith, 42, has filed a $300,000 negligence suit against Air Serv Corporation and United Airlines, claiming that an employee of the former carelessly dumped him out of his wheelchair at O'Hare in November 2010 after failing to heed his warning that one of the wheels got stuck.

Grievances: Retired Sgt Joseph Smith, a partially paralyzed former U.S. Marine, is suing an airline and airport workers after claiming that he was mistreated at O'Hare Airport in 2010

Mishandled: Smith was traveling to a shooting completion with a Paralympic team when an Air Serv worker allegedly tossed him from his wheelchair after one of the wheels got stuck

On November 17, 2010, the veteran, who was part of a Paralympic shooting team called Semper Fi, was traveling from Colorado to North Carolina to attend a competition.

Smith was trying to make a connecting flight when he claims an Air Serv worker tasked with helping disabled flyers tossed him out of his wheelchair when one of the front wheels became wedged between the plane and the jetway ramp, leaving Smith dizzy and bleeding from the head, according to the High Point Enterprise.  

Smith claims when he boarded the other flight, he was denied an aisle chair used to take handicapped travelers down tight airplanes aisles. Instead, he was forced to drag his 'limp body' to his seat in the seventh row unassisted, which he says caused his catheter bag to burst, soaking him with his own urine.

The Paralympian said he got no help from the cabin crew and ended up sitting in his urine for the duration of the two-hour flight. 

High-flying drama: Smith said United Airlines workers refused to give him an aisle chair to take him to his seat, and he had to drag his body down the aisle, which caused his catheter bag to burst

Humiliating: The veteran said he received not assistance from United personnel was was left sitting in his own urine for the entire two-hour flight

‘I had urine all over me, so I tried covering myself up,’ Smith recalled. ‘People were staring at me – it was humiliating.’

Smith said he arrived in Colorado Springs with a headache and spent the better part of two days in a hospital where he was diagnosed with a severe concussion.

On his return flight, which also took Smith through O’Hare, the 42-year-old said executives from United, Air Serv and the airport attempted to get him to sign some document, but he refused.

In the years since the incident, the companies in question offered to settle with Smith for $20,000, but he said it was not enough even to cover his hospital bill.

Pressure: Smith said executives from O'Hare, Air Serv and United tried to get him to sign some document and offered a $20,000 settlement, but he refused

Legal action: Smith's lawsuit alleges negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium

United spokesperson Christen David said in an email to the Chicago Sun-Times, ‘Our preliminary review does not corroborate Mr Smith’s version of events.’

Smith said the lawsuit alleging negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium has to do with dignity, not payoff.

‘I’ve been in a war, and if (United and Air Serv) want a war, we can go to war,’ the 42-year-old veteran said. ‘Money is not what this is about. It’s about getting things changed for the disabled, because I don’t want this to ever happen to anybody else.’
