A catholic school in Edmonton, Canada is investigating the 'unprovoked' beating of a six-year-old boy by a fellow classmate that left him bloodied and bandaged.

Joshua Goulet, 6, is afraid to go to school or go to sleep by himself after one of his classmates attacked him on the bus home from St. Maria Goretti School on Friday even while an adult was present.

'He was repeatedly punched. He was kicked. And his head was banged against the bus window until finally it was banged hard enough that it caused a cut in the back of his head, and he bled quite badly,' said the horrified boy's mother Sheila Goulet to Global News.

Victim: Joshua Goulet, 6, was attacked by a fellow classmate while he was on the bus home from school

Badly beaten: Joshua Goulet was bandaged by the school bus driver who had to pull over and administer first aid after Joshua was beaten up by a fellow classmate 

The bus was delayed for 35 minutes and neither Sheila Goulet nor her husband knew what was taking so long for their boy to come home from school.

The bus was later than usual because the bus driver had to pull over to administer first aid.

'He punched me in the face, punched me on the mouth, he kicked me in the face, then he whacked my head,' Joshua told Global News.

A manager from the bus company, First Student, met the parents at the bus stop to explain what had happened to their child.

Goulet didn't hear from the school until 5 p.m.

The boy who attacked Joshua has been suspended for a week and is not allowed back on the school bus.

Both of the boys are in the first grade but they are not in the same class.  

The attack is thought to have been completely unprovoked and the bus company is trying to decide how to provide better safety on the bus.

'I’m not sure how they’re going to do that,' Sheila Goulet admitted.

'Do we need to put supervisors on the buses? The bus drivers have to be able to drive.'

The Bus Company has said they will review their policy to make sure students re safe on the bus.

'The safety and security of the students we transport is our top priority at First Student. We were able to determine that this is a matter of student conduct. Our driver responded in accordance with the policies set forth by First Student and the school district,' said the company.

The boy's mother has said she doesn't blame the bus company and that they did everything right but that perhaps there also need to be supervisors on the bus to ensure the safety of children.
