Imagine waking up after a big night out to find you've run out of headache pills, there isn't any food in the kitchen and, to your horror, the loo roll holder is empty.

It's a nightmare! But one clever - teetotal - couple from Swindon, Wiltshire, has found a way to ease the woes of those feeling a bit worse for wear with The Hangover Man.

Luke Chequer, 28, and his fiancee 27-year-old Charlotte Broadbridge's service promises to make the morning after less of a headache - by delivering food, drink, and essentials straight to the door for a £5 fee.

Mr Chequer, who is teetotal and his fiancee Charlotte Broadbridge promise a doorstep delivery of whatever you crave - but can't face leaving the house to get yourself

The Hangover Man service will save customers a painful journey to McDonald's for a bacon and egg McMuffin or coffee from Costa.

They will deliver painkillers for headaches, Alka Seltzer to calm the stomach and even toilet roll if you've been caught short.

Or they could get you a fry-up food from a local cafe or even more alcohol if you were so inclined. 

Mr Chequer and Ms Broadbridge charge a flat £5 delivery charge on top of the cost of the order.

Their business took off on social media with more than 3,000 'likes' on Facebook in 48 hours - a week before they even opened.

The father-of-two said they struggled to meet demand in their first weekend and had to extend delivery hours and recruit a friend to help.

The couple's Facebook page received nearly 3,500 likes in 48 hours

He said: 'Everyone knows what it's like after you've been out on a big one, you don't want to leave the house but you're desperate for your cooked breakfast or McDonald's.

'You can't find the paracetamol and you've run out of loo paper.'

The couple said their start-up costs were around £500, with a couple of hundred quid's worth of stock, a few card readers and a tank of fuel.

Mr Chequer added: 'I thought it would start off quite small, just with our friends and family.

'I don't think we expected quite so many people to be interested quite so quickly. There seems to be just too much demand for one person to deliver. It has gone viral.'

McDonald's topped the delivery requests when the enterprising couple launched this last weekend.

But they were surprised by the number of people ordering who did not have hangovers.

'I expected a lot of 20-somethings with money to burn who were going out at the weekends but I had orders from everyone.

'I had orders from people who hadn't even been out the night before but who are just lazy.

'I had mums in their 40s and 50s ordering for their teenagers who were still in bed after being out the night before.

'I had families who were really excited and just wanted to do it because it was something new,' he continued.

Customers can even pay for their orders by card - an important feature as many have run out of cash the night before.

The couple, who have two children and are due to marry in August, are already planning to expand the business into a seven-day operation and into the evening.

The service also discourages people from driving after a heavy night's drinking.  

'There really is no excuse to drink-drive the morning after if you can have it delivered straight to your door, and that has to be a good thing,' Mr Chequer said. 

But this isn't Britain's first morning-after delivery service .

Alex Howsam's One Delivery franchise in Stockon delivers meals from McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Express and Burger King straight to the sofa - adding a 20 per cent mark-up cost on top of the food price.

The 31-year-old's business even offers Sunday roasts from local pub The Penny Black, in Hartburn, Stockton.
