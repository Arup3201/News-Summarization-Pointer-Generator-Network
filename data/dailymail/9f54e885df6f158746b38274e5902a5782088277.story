Schoolchildren taking part in a Guard of Honour for athletes ahead of the Olympics Opening Ceremony have been told to wear Adidas shoes to avoid the risk of being turned away.

The eight youngsters from John Hampden Primary in Oxfordshire have been informed they must either wear shoes made by the Olympics sponsor or have no visible branding on their trainers at all.

LOCOG, the organisational committee for the games, confirmed the regulations.

Children taking part in the Guard of Honour leading to the Olympic Stadium have been told to wear either Adidas or unbranded trainers

A spokesman said: '‘Young people from across the UK will form a Guard of Honour to welcome athletes ahead of the Athletes Parade.

'They have been given practical guidance on clothing, including footwear and we’ve advised comfortable, unbranded or Adidas shoes should be worn.’

Organisers have given 'practical advice' on footwear and said that only Adidas trainers, left, or shoes without clear branding on them, right, should be worn

2,000 performers will take part in the Guard of Honour and line the route as participants make their way from the Village to the Stadium ahead of the Athletes Parade.

The mother of one of the ten-year-olds due to take part said the regulations risked souring the once-in-a-lifetime event.

Lucie Copcutt, 36, said: 'If they are told what to wear, it spoils the occasion.

'They should be allowed to wear what they want as long as they look smart because not every parent can afford buy Adidas shoes,' she told the Oxford Mail.

Olympic chiefs have already been accused of taking too heavy-handed an approach to protecting the rights of sponsors.

Appearing on the Today show, Lord Coe told presenter Evan Davis he would not be allowed to wear a 'Pespi-branded' T-shirt to the event.

Lord Coe told him: 'No, you probably wouldn’t be walking in with a Pepsi T-shirt because Coca-Cola are our sponsors and they have put millions of pounds into this project but also millions of pounds into grassroots sport. It is important to protect those sponsors.'

But asked whether he could wear Nike-branded trainers, Lord Coe said: 'I think you probably could...'

His comments came weeks after organisers revealed a list of restricted items banned from the Games.

Frisbees are already banned, as are long-lens cameras, Che Guevara T-shirts and vuvuzelas.

Security will be tight with airport-style restrictions on liquids greater than 100ml and no more than one soft-sided bag is allowed and must fit under the spectator’s seat.

IOC boss Jacques Rogge has defended the strict rules to prevent 'ambush marketing' by firms not signed up as sponsors.

He said: 'We have to protect of course the sponsors, it goes without saying. You cannot ask a company to pay hundreds of millions of dollars and not be protected against ambush marketing.

'But the fight against ambush marketing will be led with a lot of common sense. Everything that is in good faith will not be affected and will not be forbidden.

'If you come with a T-shirt and it is not exactly the T-shirt of the sponsor in the venue, they will not forbid you from entering the stadium.
