A driver has deliberately rammed his vehicle into a family car in a shocking road-rage attack.

The victim, named Stephen, was driving along a NSW Central Coast street with his wife when a driver in front of him stopped at a green light.

When Stephen tooted the driver of the blue sedan, the motorist took it as a personal attack, responding with extreme force.

After having his car rammed into by the side, Stephen's car hurtled out of control, nearly slamming into a telegraph pole

When they noticed the Sedan was pursuing them down the street, Stephen's wife started filming out the window, anticipating that something serious could happen.

The driver appears to say 'F*** you buddy' before slamming his own car into the side of Stephen's vehicle, at which point the footage goes blurred from the impact.

Stephen’s car came within centimeters of colliding with a telegraph pole, an collision which could have had fatal consequences.

He has since posted extensively about the incident on Twitter, in particular what he sees as the negligent response from police.

In one post, Stephen wrote: 'What you don't see on that video is me gaining control of the car and steering past a telegraph pole... missed it by centimetres.’

‘So a road rager just deliberately rammed our car...nearly sending us into telegraph pole....and @nswpolice couldn't have given one f***.’

Stephen says his wife called 000 immediately afterwards. Police advised them to pick up his children and wait in a local service station, where they would meet him.

But after waiting for 20 minutes, Stephen gave up on the police and drove his family home, fearing the attacker could identify them from their damaged car.

In another tweet, Stephen wrote: 'still on phone to @nswpolice ..so now we have 3 kids in our smashed up car that is barely driveable but no hint from police they are coming.'

'Telling @nswpolice what happened...gotta pick up our kids from nearby ....did they send anyone? Nope...so we grab kids and drive away...'

He added he was concerned for his family's safety, writing: 'For all we know @nswpolice this bloke could be driving the streets looking for us. Smallish community here.. he knows roughly our location.'

Stephen says police arrived at his home that night to take his details, but claimed they would be unable to deal with the incident for at least a fortnight.

Stephen vented his frustration in another tweet, writing: 'Question for @nswpolice .. why does threatening and attacking someone with a car not warrant same response as if it was a knife or a gun?'

A spokesperson from NSW police told Daily Mail Australia  ‘police advised the driver to leave the area as they were concerned for their safety. They later met with the driver at their home address.'

‘The incident is under investigation.’
