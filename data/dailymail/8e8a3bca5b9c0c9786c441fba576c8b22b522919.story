Unwell: Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, 56, suffered a 'mild heart attack'

Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari was being treated in a Dubai hospital last night amid rumours he was on the verge of being forced to step down by the country’s military.

Zardari was said to have suffered a ‘minor heart attack’, according to a spokesman in Pakistan.

Officials had earlier claimed that the 56-year-old had gone to the Arab state for treatment for an existing heart condition, angina.

In London, Pakistan’s High Commissioner to Britain, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, said he spoke over the telephone to Zardari on Tuesday night in Dubai.

Hasan said doctors in the UAE confirmed Zardari has angina, but it wasn’t clear yet whether he had suffered a heart attack.

‘Whatever the case, he has no immediate plans to step down,’ he added.

News that he had travelled to Dubai provoked speculation in Pakistan that Zardari may use ill health as a pretext for stepping down under pressure from the country’s powerful military.

The Pakistani ambassador to the U.S. was recently forced to resign after allegations he sent a memo to Washington asking for its help in reining in the generals in Islamabad.

This has intensified pressure on Zardari, president for three years, who has many enemies in the media and political elite.

The Washington-based Foreign Policy 
magazine quoted an unnamed former U.S. government official as saying 
Zardari was ‘incoherent’ when he spoke with President Barack Obama by 
telephone over the weekend.

The official said Zardari may resign on account of ‘ill health’ amid the uproar over the memo.

His spokesman, Farhatullah Babar, said: ‘All these reports are untrue, imaginary and speculative.’

The president’s condition was ‘not serious’ and he would return to Pakistan soon, he added

There are several reasons Mr Zardari could be feeling the strain, however.

Tensions: Pakistan is under pressure from the West to contain militant insurgents in its borderland region and relations with the U.S. and India are strained

Tensions between the government and military have plagued the country for almost its entire existence, with the military ruling the country for more than half of its 64-year history.

Relations with the U.S. have also hit rock bottom after a year of bust-ups, despite the $20billion in security and economic aid given to Pakistan since 2001 - much of it reimbursements for assistance in fighting militants.

First there was the jailing of a CIA contractor for shooting dead two Pakistanis in Lahore.

Then there was the secret U.S. Navy Seals raid inside Pakistan that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, as well as accusations from the U.S. that Pakistan was involved in attacked on American targets in Afghanistan.

Ties were also further split by a Nato air strike on November 26 on two border posts that killed 24 soldiers, infuriating the Pakistan military.

And concerns have been raised over the possibility of conflict between Pakistan and India over the disputed Kashmir region, with neither side willing to back down.
