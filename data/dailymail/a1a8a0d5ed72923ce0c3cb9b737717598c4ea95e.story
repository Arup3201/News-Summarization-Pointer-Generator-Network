Lawyers for the wife of missing millionaire Guma Aguiar say they believe the man may still be alive and hiding out in the Netherlands.

The oil tycoon mysteriously disappeared from Fort Lauderdale, Florida on June 19 and his wife, Jaimie Aguiar, has speculated that he could have faked his own death to avoid losing his $100 million fortune.

An attorney for the man's wife has told the local press that the missing man's sister intends to relocate to the Netherlands, raising suspicion that she could be planning to rejoin her brother, who could have relocated to Europe.

Willliam Scherer, an attorney for Jaimie Aguiar, told WPLG-TV that they believe Aguiar's sister, Angelika, plans to move to the Netherlands or could already be living there.

A close business associate of Aguiar also resides in the Netherlands, the lawyer added.

'We want to know, what's up?' Scherer told the news station.

'Angelika filed a paper that said she
was either intending to or residing in the Netherlands and had a 
Netherlands official attest to her affidavit. And that struck us as 
strange. Why the Netherlands? And then we find out that one of Guma's 
close business associates has also relocated to the Netherlands.'

The multi-millionaire had reportedly 
argued with his wife, when she is said to have threatened him with a 
divorce, hours before he disappeared.

A lawyer for Guma Aguiar's mother 
Ellen said the wealthy philanthropist was in low spirits when he went 
out on his boat that fateful Tuesday in June, after receiving the blow 
from his wife Jamie.

Mr Aguiar, a father of four, had filed for divorce last July but did not go through with it.

The 35-year-old man had spoken with his mother, Ellen Aguiar, an hour before he got on to his 31-foot boat, the T.T. Zion, and sailed off on June 19.

His empty motorboat later washed ashore on a beach in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

The missing millionaire left his wedding ring behind following a fight with his wife before boarding his speedboat for trip.

The boat was found having run aground on a Fort Lauderdale beach with the lights on and its
engine on full throttle.

Fort Lauderdale police still do not 
suspect foul play, though facts revealed about Aguiar following his 
disappearance show he had had a difficult few months.

In
addition to battling with her son's wife for control of his estimated 
$100 million fortune, Aguiar's mother hopes that her son may still be 
alive.

In a 
petition filed to a Florida court to seize his fortune, 
Ellen Aguiar stated that her son 'may be in a delusional state or be 
suffering from psychosis or otherwise may have disappeared.'

His mother, Ellen Aguiar, alleged that her son's $100 million estate would be squandered by his wife.

His home in Fort Lauderdale is valued at
$5 million, he has seven cars valued at $1.1 million, and a yacht that 
is valued at $2.1 million, according to Mrs Aguiar's petition.

In 2006, Aguiar sold his company, Leor Energy, for a reported $2.55 billion.

The 35-year-old energy magnate was a well known philanthropist, supporting many Israeli causes. 

The Brazilian born millionaire was born to Jewish parents but was raised as an Evangelical Christian.

He has donated $8 million in the past
to Nefesh b'Nefesh, an organization that helps American and British 
Jews move to Israel, and was also a large supporter of the 'March of the
Living,' an educational program in Poland and Israel designed to 
continue public awareness of the Holocaust in those countries.

He also became a regular on Israeli sports pages when he invested $4 
million into Israeli Premier League soccer team Beitar Jerusalem in July
2009.

In September 2009, Aguiar also purchased Jerusalem's leading basketball franchise Hapoel Jerusalem for $1.5 million.

Despite his family and business 
interests, Aguiar has a history of mental illness and was admitted to an
Israeli psychiatric hospital after claiming to know a soldier in Israel
who had been abducted by the terrorist group Hamas.

And court documents indicate that in 
2011, Aguiar's wife Jaime and his mother, successfully petitioned a 
Miami-Dade judge to appoint an emergency guardian for him.

In addition, Aguiar and his uncle, 
Thomas Kaplan have been locked in litigation over the $2.55 billion sale
of an energy company they co-founded called Leor Exploration and 
Production LLC which was involved in gas extraction in Texas.
