Amir Mason Taylor was born o a Metro platform Thursday morning

A healthy baby boy was born on the platform of a Washington, D.C. Metro station on Thursday morning.

Above the rumble of passing trains, Amir Mason Taylor was ushered into the world at 10:31 a.m. by a stranger who rushed to help the expectant mother, 23-year-old Shavonnte Taylor.

Taylor, who wasn't due until August 17, was on her way home from a doctor's appointment on the Metro's Green Line when she started experiencing heavy contractions.

She stepped out onto the Metro platform at L'Enfant Plaza and didn't make it very far before her contractions brought her to her knees near the bottom of an escalator and she began screaming.

A licensed emergency medical 
technician who happened to be switching trains at the station heard 
Taylor's screams and rushed to her aid. 

Autumn
Manka, 34, moved Taylor from her side to her back and used another 
Metro rider's shirt to make sure the baby never touched the station's 
floor, according to the Washington Post.

As trains clattered past the platform, Manka delivered the 8-pound, 5-ounce baby.

'It was amazing,' Manka told the Post. 'It was a baby coming into the world. Definitely the experience of a lifetime.'

Shavonnte Taylor, 23, who was due on August 17, was on her way home from a doctor's appointment on the Metro's Green Line when she started having heavy contractions

This is L'Enfant Plaza, the Metro station in Washington, D.C. where Taylor delivered her baby at 10:30 a.m. on Thursday

Paramedics arrived shortly after the baby's birth and took Taylor and her son to a nearby hospital.

'I
was just happy that he was healthy,' Taylor told the Post in an 
interview at George Washington University Hospital on Thursday night. 
'It wasn’t the way I wanted to have him, but it went fine.'

The baby's grandmother, Shomari Stone, told NBC Washington: 'I couldn't believe it when I got the call from transit that my grandson is here. I'm so thankful that they're okay.'

He was born one day before Pierre L'Enfant's birthday. The architect of Washington, D.C. - whom the Metro station is named after - was born Aug. 2, 1754. L'Enfant is French for child.

News of 'Metro Baby' spread like wildfire on Twitter, and Metro announced that it would give Taylor a $100 SmarTrip card as a gift. 

The child is Taylor's fourth. She has two girls and another boy between the ages of one and five

The agency tweeted a photo of the card along with a handwritten note of congratulations from general manager Richard Sarles.

'Congratulations on the birth of your son!' Sarles wrote in the note. 'I am sure that the delivery did not go exactly as you had imagined, but I hope that our employees and customers who assisted you were a source of support and comfort. Please accept the enclosed SmarTrip card worth $100 in Metro fare... as our gift.'

The child is Taylor's fourth. She has two girls and another boy between the ages of one and five.

Amir Mason may be the first child to be born on a Metro platform. A 22-year-old woman went into labor in 2012 at D.C's Congress Heights station but she didn't actually give birth on the platform. 

Metro announced that it would give Taylor a $100 SmarTrip card as a gift. The agency tweeted this photo of the card along with a handwritten note of congratulations from general manager Richard Sarles.
