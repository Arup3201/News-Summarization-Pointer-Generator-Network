Decades before mobile phones and a world away from Facebook, Harold 'Johnny' Johnson and Eddie Scott Jones thought it was farewell when they were released from their Nazi prison.

After being shot down on separate missions - and parachuting onto enemy soil - the pair met in the barbed-wire cells of Stalag Luft VI, a prisoners of war camp, in 1944.

Both aspiring artists, they became inseparable, sitting together and drawing as a way to cope with life as hostages in their icy Lithuanian jail.

But when liberation came, life had to go on, so Leeds-born Johnny, 23, and 21-year-old Eddie from Liverpool were forced to part ways.

Neither could have imagined, as they were awarded parachute tie pins and bade each other a terse, but emotional farewell, that an accidental meeting would bring them back together - leading to 70 years of friendship.

Years later, the startled pair were reunited in the comfortable confines of the office café at Pagan Smith advertisers in Liverpool - a step up from their usual backdrop.

'I was working at Pagan Smith advertisers in Liverpool,' Mr Jones, now 91, explained.

'Someone pointed at my tie pin and said "there's someone else with one of those that works here".'

Curious to meet another parachuter, he followed his colleague along - only to find his friend and fellow inmate proudly wearing his own medal.

The caterpillar was given to anyone who had been forced to parachute from their aircraft.

Past: Mr Jones sketched out his memory of soaring over enemy lines, picking targets and places to land

Mr Johnson, a tail gunner who flew with 102 Squadron, bailed out of his Halifax aircraft twice - his second landing him clean into Nazi handcuffs.

Despite being dubbed ‘golden balls’ by colleagues for always escaping in the nick of time, his luck ran out on December 3, 1942 when his plane was shot down from 15,000ft.

It was the bravery of its young pilot, who died in the crash, that led to his survival.

Light-hearted: Prisoners made light of their horrific situation. Mr Jones's captions make fun of crash landings

Standards: The soldiers were expected to maintain decorum and style throughout the terrifying war

'I remember going up to the front and he turned round to me and said "get out - and that’s an order. Go!",' explains Johnny, who escaped the doomed plane only to parachute directly into the square of a German barracks.

Meanwhile Liverpool-born Mr Jones, who flew with the Canadian 428 Squadron, was on his penultimate sortie before being eligible for six months’ leave when he was taken prisoner.

'We’d been bending some railway lines at Lens in northern France,' he explains of the events of April 20 1944.

'We succeeded in blowing up an ammunition train and then set course for home when were pounced on by a JU88, and it started a fire in the fuselage.'

Both men eventually ended up in Stalag Luft VI in what is now Lithuania - the German’s northern-most POW camp, where they lived in adjoining huts.

Desperate to protect their highest ranking hostages, the Nazis allowed the pair to take it easy.

'As aircrew we weren’t allowed to work, we were too valuable,' Mr Johnson explained. 'That’s how I met Eddie, we used to draw.

Life at war: Mr Jones depicts being faced with the barrell of a gun, left, or 'watching the third reich', right

Marching: The prisoners of war were worked hard as they wondered whether they would make it out alive

'The Red Cross issued us with a big diary, and so we used to go round to each other, I’d go to Eddie and he’d put something in it, and I’d put something in his.'

The two professional artists still reminisce about their time in captivity - documented by a series of sketches Eddie hid from their German guards.

'Ver did you get this bread?', reads the caption on one picture of a Nazi confronting a squaddie.

Another shows an airman 'watching the Third Reich' from his plane, while others shows a camp commandant wielding a pistol or marching towards the camp gates.

The pair laugh as Mr Jones explains another popular pass-time: winding up their camp guards whenever possible.

He said: 'We made a great effort for them not to see us depressed. We were always laughing about something or another.

'As a term of punishment - someone had done something, tried to escape or something like that - they’d say "we’ll close the theatre for a week".

'And instead of everyone groaning, there was a big cheer and clapping. "We’ll close it for two weeks". And there was more clapping and laughing.

'In the end they couldn’t beat us.'

When the camp was finally liberated, both Mr Johnson and Mr Jones returned to Britain, ending up in the same city and the same company, raising families and becoming professional artists. Still working together, their drawings have been exhibited across Merseyside and beyond.
