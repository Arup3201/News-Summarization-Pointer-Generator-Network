Servicemen and ex-servicemen lined the entrance to the crematorium while members of the RAF performed a fly-past before the service started.

So many people turned up at the funeral that some were forced to listen to the service from outside. 

Laurie Black, 77, who attended the short service, where Mr Ingham Nutbrown was given a full military guard of honour, said the RAF veteran was given a 'heroic send off'.

He said: 'I served as a jet engine fitter in the RAF for five years so I've been a member of the RAF Association for many years.

'The chairman of the group got in touch to ask us all if we would be willing to attend the funeral after hearing Mr Nutbrown had no family or friends.

'Word soon spread and the response was absolutely astounding - there must have been more than a thousand people here. It was so busy I couldn't even get in to watch the service.

Little is known about Mr Ingham Nutbrown's life, but he is believed to have served in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, and spent most of his life living in Shotton, Deeside

There was standing room only at the funeral as hundreds unexpectedly turned up to pay their respects to Mr Ingham Nutbrown

'Mr Nutbrown was given a full military guard of honour and some of the tributes were very moving.

'It's such an incredible thing to see and I'm sure Mr Nutbrown would have been very proud of the send off.'

The service opened with the playing of the theme tune to the film The Dam Busters while members of RAF Valley on Anglesey were among those who attended. 

Michael Clegg, 72, who attended the funeral, served in the RAF for 39 years and ended his career as a maritime pilot.

The RAF veteran, from Ternhill, Shropshire, said: 'I was sent an email from one of my friends asking if I could attend.

The RAF Association appealed for people to attend a service in Mr Ingham Nutbrown's memory at Chester Crematorium

People came from far and wide to pay their respects - even though Mr Nutbrown was believed to have had 'no family or friends'

'I was determined to pay my respects so I travelled up from Shropshire to be here. It was a surreal experience, one I will never forget.

'I was stood in the annex of the building but there were a few hundred more stuck outside because the crematorium was packed.

'There were ex-RAF personnel along with people from the Army and the Royal Navy - the turnout was simply astonishing.

'It's incredible to think that people who didn't even know Mr Ingham Nutbrown have still turned up to show their respect.

'The vicar didn't say much about him but the notable thing was that he was said to be a very nice man who would always help others. I'm so overwhelmed to be a part of this - it was incredibly touching.'
