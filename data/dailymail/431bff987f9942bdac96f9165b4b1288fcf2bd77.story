Mark Cavendish won the seventh and final stage of the Tour de San Luis after beating rival Fernando Gaviria in a frenzied sprint for the finish line.

Cavendish went into the last day of the tour way down in 90th place after being pipped to the line by Gaviria in the first and third stages of the race in Argentina.

But the Manxman used all his sprinting expertise to beat the 20-year-old Colombian by a fraction of a second on Sunday and claim the final stage.

Afterwards he paid tribute to Argentinian Dani Diez, who won the overall tour.

'This is the second time he has won this race and the Argentinians have a strong team,' Cavendish told ESPN.

'It was a good race for the fans and the riders.'

Rodolfo Torres came second overall and his Colombian compatriot Nairo Quintana finished third.
