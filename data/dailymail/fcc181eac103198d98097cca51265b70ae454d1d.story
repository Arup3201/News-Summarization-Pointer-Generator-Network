A small class of ‘super shoppers’ who increasingly use tablets and smartphones to make purchases are behind nearly three quarters of the money spent in shops in the UK.

Just 18 per cent of the population account for 70 per cent of all UK retail sales, which came to more than £200 billion last year.

Research found that young professionals aged 25 to 44, many of whom work in managerial roles, make the biggest contribution to spending.

These influential shoppers were found to be 30 per cent more likely to research products online before visiting a store than the average customer.

And using store websites and advice forums before looking at an item in-store meant the value of the purchase can be up to 50 per cent more than if the customer used just one channel.

The study found that one third of shoppers follow the ¿showrooming¿ trend- visiting a store before making a purchase online

The investigation into online and store shopping by eBay and Deloitte found that two thirds of all shoppers now consult a number of retail sources before they make a purchase of more than £100.

Three quarters of all shoppers use review and price comparison websites to help them choose which product they want.

The study found that one third of shoppers follow the ‘showrooming’ trend - visiting a store before making a purchase online.

But it has become more popular to do the reverse - with 34 per cent of people looking online first and then buying in-store.

Tanya Lawler, Vice President of eBay in the UK, commented: ‘Customers are in the driving seat and pushing retailers for ever higher standards of service and greater convenience.

‘Customers fully expect your store and online channels to be joined up and can have little patience if they aren’t. 

‘For example, they want to collect in store or return via the store, even if they bought online.‘

Ian Geddes, Partner at Deloitte, said: ‘Compared to other consumers, these so-called “Super Shoppers” account for a larger share of spending, use a wider range of resources to research purchases and they do this using a greater variety of channels.

‘Our study suggests that retailers can target this valuable group through a broad presence over a range of channels.’
