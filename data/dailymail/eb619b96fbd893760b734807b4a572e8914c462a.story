Police officers had to disperse hoards of screaming girls who had queued for hours to catch a glimpse of Olympic ace Tom Daley.

Die-hard fans took sleeping bags and camped outside Bluewater shopping centre in Kent from 1am this morning.

By 9.30am - three hours before Tom was due to arrive - staff at Waterstones had to close the queue because of the huge number of hysterical fans.

And staff at the bookstore said the crowd levels were unprecedented and even bigger than those who had previously turned out to see boy bands.

What a turn out: Fans queued for 12 hours to see their hero Tom Daley at a book signing in Bluewater

Dedicated: Hordes of screaming girls waited for hours to get their books signed by Daley

A Kent Police spokeswoman said: 'We have
a team of 11 officers at the Bluewater shopping centre, some of whom 
were on a training day.

'It was good that there were so many there because the crowds to see Mr Daley were quite big and excitable.

'There were a number who didn’t have tickets but wanted to see Tom, so as you can imagine, they were causing a bit of a kerfuffle.

'A few people were asked to leave by officers.'

Hundreds of teenage girls with 'I love Tom' painted on their faces, chanted 'We want Tom, we want Tom!' as they waited for the Olympic bronze medalist to arrive at 12.30pm.

A member of staff at Waterstones said: 'This is even more crazy than the book signings we’ve done with One Direction.'

The 18-year-old Olympian - whose rumoured girlfriend Kassidy Cook went shopping with his mum Debbie while he signed books - was so overwhelmed by the reaction he asked his publicist to take a photo of the queue for him.

Worth the wait? Fans queued for hours to see the Olympic bronze medallist

Patient: The fans began to turn out at 1.30am this morning to see Daley

He said: 'It’s all a bit crazy, to be honest. I can’t believe the amount of support here today.

'There’s hundreds of people waiting outside. The response has been amazing. It’s crazy to think people have been actually camping outside overnight to meet me.

'I’m really sad that I couldn’t get to see everybody.'

Tom, who was also celebrating achieving straight As in his A-levels, was even given a ring-shaped sweet by one adoring fan, who asked if he would wear it.

The Olympic posterboy dashed her hopes by replying: 'Thank you. But can I eat it instead?'

Lucy Cottrell, 14, from Chislehurst, Kent, was in tears after getting her copy of Tom’s autobiography My Story signed.

She said : 'I’m shaking. I’m crying. I’ve been here since 8am. I love Tom, everything about him is just amazing. I can’t believe I’ve just met him.'

She and her friend Louise Houghton, who was celebrating her 14th birthday, were wearing 'I love Tom Daley' t-shirts, which they had made especially for the book signing.

Lucy said: 'Meeting Tom is the best birthday present ever. I’m his biggest fan. I wish I’d got a cuddle from him.'

Meanwhile 12-year-old Ruby Verge, from Bexleyheath, south London, said she was never going to wash again after Tom signed her arm.

She said: 'He’s just so cute. It’s amazing. This has been the best day ever. I can’t believe his signature is on my arm - I’m not going to wash now for a long time.'

And 14-year-old Amelia Thompson, who travelled 100 miles with her mum from Bury St Edmonds in Suffolk to meet Tom, had even drawn a picture of her hero to give him.

She said: 'I’m a massive fan. I gave Tom the photo and he said: "Wow, did you draw that? That’s incredible."

'He then gave me a hug. It was amazing.'

Emily Tregear, 12, from Blackheath, south London, was first in the queue to meet Tom after camping outside overnight with her sister Lucy.

She said: 'We got here at 1am and slept outside in sleeping bags. I’ve loved him ever since I saw him compete in Beijing. I can’t believe I just met him.'

Lucky: Daley was also signing books for doting fans in Oxford yesterday

Tom, who was wearing a red and white striped t-shirt and jeans, was flooded with gifts from his fans, including chocolates, friendship bracelets and even a balloon.

He also reached dizzy heights in his A-Levels this morning, achieveing an A in Spanish.

The 18-year-old, who stormed to a bronze medal in the Olympic 10m men’s platform event, sent a message to his 1.5 million followers on micro-blogging site Twitter this morning.

Daley, who received his A-level Spanish mark today, wrote: 'I got an A in Spanish! Overall I have A* photography (A2), A Spanish (A2) and A maths (AS) :) thanks @PlymColleg1 :D' 

Speaking after the book signing, Daley said: 'So far I'm on an A* in photography an A in Spanish and an A in AS maths - so three As.

'I'm very happy with the results so far.

'I've got two more maths modules to finish but so far so good.

'The plan now is for me to go back to school and do a couple more maths modules.

'I've got the junior world diving championships in October and then it's working towards the World Championships next year.

'Since the Olympic Games it's been good fun.

'I'm in London spending some time with my mum.

'It's been really good just to eat what I want.

Hug it out: Daley was congratulated by his coach when he finished third behind David Boudia and Qiu Bo

'Although I haven't really been that unhealthy because when I'm not training I don't feel as hungry because I'm not using as much energy.

'But it's been good.

'It was awesome winning a bronze medal in front of a home crowd.

'It was so good to have something to show for all the effort and hard work and dedication and sacrifices I've had to make.'

Plymouth College, which also counts 
100m gold medal swimmer Ruta Meilutyte, 15, among its pupils, replied on
Twitter: 'Brilliant, well done. A nice addition to your Olympic bronze 
medal!'

Daley scored an A* in photography at 
the Devon college last year. He will return to Plymouth in September to 
complete his maths A-level and to study Spanish at a higher level, a 
spokesman confirmed.

Headteacher Dr Simon Wormleighton, who 
was among around 100 of Daley’s staff and friends who gathered to watch 
him compete in the final at the Aquatics Centre last Saturday night, 
said: 'I am delighted to see such an excellent set of A-level results.

'All our students should be very 
proud of what they have achieved. I would like to pass on my thanks to 
the teaching staff for their continued commitment and hard work, which 
has helped our students to reach such a high level of achievement. 

'We have a busy and vibrant sixth form community and it is extremely rewarding to see them do so well.'

Hopeful: Tom Daley wished luck to other across the country collecting their A-Level results this morning

Another high score: Daley followed his bronze medal at the Olympics with impressive results at A-Level

A
photograph of Daley’s A-level results sheet, which he uploaded on the 
internet this morning, showed he scored nearly 100 per cent in his speaking 
assessment, with 59 points out of 60 available.

He also received 112 out of 140 for the listening, reading and writing component, taking his grade to an A overall.

Daley has been a student at Plymouth 
College since April 2009 when, as a 15-year-old, he was taken out of 
Plymouth’s state-run Eggbuckland Community College, after claiming he 
was being bullied.

Before Daley received his results, he wished luck to his fellow A-Level students across the country.

The Team GB diver said: 'Good luck to everyone collecting A level results today!!! I am getting mine soon :O'

A Plymouth College spokesman confirmed that Daley did not collect his results in person, but received them by email.

He is due to spend part of today meeting fans and signing copies of his biography, My Story, at the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent.

Proud: Jess Harper hopes to represent Team GB at the 2016 Rio Paralympic Games

Swimmer Jess Harper is celebrating after achieving the A-level grades that she hopes could lead to a spot in the Paralympics at Rio 2016.

The 18-year-old Londoner scooped straight As and will now go to Brown University in Rhode Island, USA, where she will compete in disability swimming events.

She said: 'They’ve got a great swimming programme over there and the coaches are really brilliant.

'I’m hoping that will give me the boost I need to make it for 2016.'

The Putney High School pupil, whose lower left arm failed to develop before she was born, is ranked number 19 in the world in the 100 metre butterfly event.

Jess squeezed in her schoolwork for English, French, Spanish and history along with nine training sessions a week.

'It is a challenge. It means I have to be really organised. I’m waking up early and going to bed late,” she said.

When asked whether she preferred academic work or swimming, Jess replied: 'At some points they were both equally gruelling, but it has to be swimming.'

At Putney High School, south-west London, some 63 per cent of all A-level entries achieved A* or A grades.
