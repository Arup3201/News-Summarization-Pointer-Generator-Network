He began piano lessons at the age of five, and threw his first football at the age of 12.

Now, Chad Thomas plays nine musical instruments and is one of the best high-school players in the country - a feat that has seen the 18-year-old receive 150 college scholarship offers.

Thomas, who maintains a 3.3 grade-point average at Booker T. Washington high school in Miami, is an All-American Athlete and has taken up the piano, trombone, tuba, small tuba, guitar, bass guitar, snare, trumpet and drums, according to the Miami Herald.

Talented: Chad Thomas, 18, maintains a 3.3. grade point average at Booker T. Washington High School and is an All-American athlete, despite the fact he only started playing football at the age of 12

The teenage sensation, who also helped 
his school football team to a national title and back-to-back state championships, was only three years old when he developed a passion for music, after his grandmother played him gospel music.

He then picked up a guitar as a toddler and was signed up for piano lessons when he was just five.

Before becoming a football star, Thomas had to 
persuade his parents to let him play because he suffered from asthma 
and a slight heart murmur.

Thomas' football coach Tim Harris told
 the paper: 'I thought he was full of it when he told me he played all 
these instruments. Then he started playing them in front of me ... I was
 impressed.'

He has been touted as the third best 
defensive end in the country and is so passionate about football, he 
normally cries before a game.

When he was seven, his grandmother died, and he was forced to look after himself because his parents were constantly working.

'I just took it upon myself to learn how to play the instruments that I hear in the songs', he said.

When Thomas is not studying, he is performing his own tracks at clubs and at parties.

One of his songs he produced with local musician Lil Dred has been downloaded 245,000 times on SoundCloud.

Bright future: He has been named as the third best high-school defensive end in the country and is set to sign a letter of intent for the University of Miami this week

Dedicated: He began playing the guitar as a toddler and started piano lessons when he was just five

He has been 
under the media spotlight this week, after signing a national letter of 
intent for the University of Miami where he is set to play next year. Thomas was offered a scholarship for both music and football.

The teenage sensation added: 'It’s always 
been in my mind to go to school there.

'Football is not for long. I can 
go down with a knee injury tomorrow, but I know I’ll always be able to 
move my fingers and play an instrument, click a mouse.'
