British airlines could be barred from flying across Siberia on routes between Europe and Asia, it was revealed today.

Russia is considering imposing the curbs on air companies from countries which have targeted Moscow with sanctions over the Ukraine crisis.

The 'tit-for-tat' move could hit British and other EU airlines hard, adding costs and time to routes to the Far East.

A senior government official told Vedomosti newspaper today that a ban or limit on flights across Siberia was on the agenda in the wake of the most recent EU sanctions which in particular targeted an Aeroflot offshoot airline called Dobrolet.

Talks have been held by the Foreign and Transport Ministry in Moscow over curbs on Western airlines which have dozens of flights daily using Siberian airspace between Europe and Asia.

'Any unfriendly measures taken by the EU, including that concerning air transportation, will be considered and not left without the response,' said a diplomatic source.

'To fly to Asia European airlines presently use the shortest Trans-Siberian route and pay for it to Russian Aeroflot. According to the source close to the company, Aeroflot receives less than $300 million annually from foreign airlines,' reported state-owned RIA Novosti news agency.

Dobrolet, launched its first commercial flights from the Russian capital to Crimea's main city Simferopol in June.

In July, the air company started selling tickets for flights to cities across Russia, including Volgograd, Perm, Samara, Ufa, Yekaterinburg and Kazan - but it was included on an EU sanctions blacklist unveiled on 30 July, added the news agency.

In the wake of the EU sanctions, budget airline Dobrolet was forced to suspend flights for holidaymakers.

Western airlines BA, Virgin Atlantic and Lufthansa are among those that regularly use the skies over the east of Russia, stated The Siberian Times today.

'Their costs could spiral if they needed to find alternative routes avoiding Russian air space,' said the website.

The move comes as a former Ukraine defence minister warned about a rise in Russian troop numbers on the border with Ukraine.

'There are 33,000 members of the Russian Armed Forces and 160 tanks close the borders of Ukraine,' said Mykhailo Koval, now deputy secretary of Ukraine's the National Security and Defence Council.

'Especially powerful groups are on the territory of Crimea - 23,000 servicemen. No less powerful forces are on the direction from Chernigov to Taganrog. '

He alleged: 'All the measures that are currently under way in the areas adjacent to the east of our country.'

It was 'a clear demonstration of the preparation of the armed forces of the Russian Federation to engage in active hostilities'.

Ukraine said its forces are closing on the major city of Donetsk - currently held by rebels - and urged separatist fighters to allow civilians to flee the besieged city.
