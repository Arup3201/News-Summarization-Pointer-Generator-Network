As workouts go, boxing and ballet are both favorites of the fitness-loving fashion set. Now the two have been combined to create a powerful new short film.

Supermodel Hilary Rhoda and actress Sophia Bush play competitors readying for a fight in a YouTube video for New York-based jewelry label Dannijo.

They are seen lifting weights, doing sit-ups - and having their make-up done - in preparation for the ring.

That's a wrap: Actress Sophia Bush plays a boxer in a new short film for jewelry label Dannijo

Multitasking: Supermodel Hilary Rhoda is seen having her make-up done while doing sit-ups

Titled Box 'Em Out, the film takes inspiration 
from the intensity and emotion associated with both disciplines and 
celebrates women with a strong body and mind.

'The idea of juxtaposing the two sports as inspiration would make for a 
soft yet tough, and bold yet elegant aesthetic,' explain Dannijo co-founders Danielle Snyder and Jodie Snyder-Morel.

Ready for the ring: The film is a platform to showcase Dannijo's fall/winter collection

Looking sharp: Silk robes and hand wraps set the boxing scene, but flawless make-up and manicures ensure Boxerina is very much a fashion film

'Both sports have an 
emphasis on repetition and dedication so for our latest Boxerina film, 
we wanted to celebrate that very spirit.'

And
 the sisters even make an appearance in the film themselves, 
effortlessly holding their own against their famous co-stars. Indeed, 
they themselves do regular workouts with a boxing coach - one if the 
inspirations for the Boxerina collection.

'As the brand evolves it's important that we create experiences - taking 
bits and pieces of what we personally love to do and injecting it into 
the collection to make it part of our brandâ€™s experience,' they said.

Working it out: Jodie is seen warming up with a punch bag

'To that end, 
we're launching a Boxerina bootcamp with our boxing coach to celebrate 
women with both a strong body and mind.'

The video is a follow-up to the label's first fashion film, released in June, which starred dancers from American Ballet Theatre and featured a voiceover from acclaimed 
sports photographer, Neil Leifer.

And both, of course, make for a sensational showcase for the jewelry that has made the Dannijo sisters the darlings of the New York style set.
