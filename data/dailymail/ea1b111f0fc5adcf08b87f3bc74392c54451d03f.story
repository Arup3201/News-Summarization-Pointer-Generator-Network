Three friends are safely back in the UK after an incredible 11,000 mile, 38 day journey across 17 countries in a 1976 Austin Allegro Estate.

Simon Kuznetsov, Vincent Cook, and Alastair Adams drove the classic motor - which they purchased for just £651 on eBay and nicknamed Melanie - from Leeds to Ulan Bator, Mongolia as part of the famous Mongol Rally.

The trio burned through nine tyres, battled faulty brakes and lost the exhaust pipe 27 times during the journey.

Epic journey: Three friends have completed an 11,000 mile journey from Leeds to Mongolia in a 1976 Austin Allegro 

By the time the 38-year-old car spluttered across the finish line in 118th place it had lost its suspension, fuel tank, electronics and windscreen wipers.

Racing as 'Lost in Allegro', the team, from Leeds, raised almost £3,000 for their chosen charities Alzheimers Research, Friends of Alfie Martin, Cool Earth and Shelterbox.

Engineering teacher Simon, 26, said: 'It was absolutely falling to bits and it’s just amazing that it made it to the finish line.

'Our car limped there and we were determined to get it over the finish line on its own steam.'

Vincent, 25, said: 'The best bits were the people we met and the welcomes we received, seeing the world from a new perspective, challenging ourselves, making light of tough situations and raising money for great charities.'

The much-loved car is still in Mongolia and waiting to be shipped home so the team can restore it.

Teammate Alastair, 25, said: 'It would be way cheaper to just buy another but the car holds a sentimental value now.'

Speaking about the experience, he added: 'We learned that the world is a very small place if we can drive a third of it in just over a month in a battered old Allegro.

'People are amazing all over the world, especially the lesser-travelled countries like Iran and Turkmenistan. We met some of the most hospitable, kind and helpful people in these countries.'

The Mongol Rally, which typically begins in the UK and ends in Mongolia, is described as the 'greatest motoring adventure on the planet'. 

Participating cars have to be deliberately unsuitable for the challenge, and there is no set route. 

There are just three rules, as described on the website. Participants must 'take a farcically small vehicle', are 'completely on their own', and must raise at least £1,000 for charity.

'The Mongol Rally is about getting lost, using your long neglected wits, raising shedloads of cash for charity and scraping into the finish line with your vehicle in tatters and a wild grin smeared across your grubby face,' the website states.  

A feature length documentary of their journey is currently being edited and will be shown released later this year.
