Threats: Simon Phillips a accused a police officer of rape

A paranoid schizophrenic drug addict, who falsely accused a police officer of rape and threatened to tell Jeremy Kyle unless he received £30,000, is behind bars.

Simon Dylan Phillips, 44, was sent to prison for more than four years after he admitted blackmailing a serving police officer.

Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard Phillips had sent a CD and notes to the officer's brother claiming he had raped a member of Phillips' family when she was just 14.

When the grandfather had been interviewed by police after the first note was delivered, he had denied sending it.

But the court heard Phillips, of Mount Pleasant in Merthyr Vale, had continued to send the threatening correspondence.

In his last letter he demanded the money and a three-bedroom house to be put in his name.

If he did not get his way he threatened to tell not only tell his victim's wife, but also the media, including the popular daytime TV presenter Jeremy Kyle.

John Ryan, prosecuting, said the blackmailing had taken place between February 12 and March 1.

In February the officer, who has not been named, received a phone call from a local man to say that he had been contacted by Phillips over the false allegations.

Mr Ryan said: 'This shocked him.'

Police questioned Phillips, but he had denied any knowledge of the phone call. However, repeated notes then started to arrive at the officer's brother's house, the last of which demanded the house and money.

Defending Phillips, Lucy Crowther blamed the blackmail offence on his addiction to drugs and his paranoid schizophrenia.

She said: 'He is quite able to see in sobriety that his delusions about the officer were wholly based in his own wandering mind.

Blackmail: Phillips even went to the lengths of threatening to go to TV presenter Jeremy Kyle in his attempt to extort cash and a house

'He has an extensive and supportive family including those who have had to put up with his behaviour and paranoia for some time.

“This has been an utter wake up call 
for him to realise that it is now time to put the grandchildren first 
and support his family as best he can and to overcome his addiction.'

At the time of the offence, Phillips 
was already on bail for drugs offences after he was found with £3,657 of
cannabis and amphetamine, which he had claimed he was keeping safe for a
family member.

But Phillips, who has appeared in court 11 times in connection for 32 offences, later admitted possessing the drugs with intent to supply.

Judge Richard Twomlow jailed Phillips for a total of four years and three months, describing the allegations he made as 'scurrilous'.

He added: 'There was considerable planning and the aim of financial reward.'

Phillips will have to pay a £120 victim surcharge and the drugs were ordered to be forfeited and destroyed.
