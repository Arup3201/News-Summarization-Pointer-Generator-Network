Neighbour Chris Hard, 62, said: 'It's
just tragic, I think the baby was only a few weeks old and the family 
must be devastated to lose their child.

'You just don't expect it on your 
street, the police cars screamed up the top of the road this morning 
when I was only just getting out of the shower.

'There's a few schools up there so I thought at first it was something to do with the school.'

Another neighbour Carer Barbara Bannan, 45, said: 'There were two or three ambulances and at least half a dozen police 
cars that went up to the house.

'Then the air ambulance landed on the playing field behind the street up there.

'We think it's a little baby that has
died and the whole street is in shock, there's loads of kids around 
here as it's a real family area.'
