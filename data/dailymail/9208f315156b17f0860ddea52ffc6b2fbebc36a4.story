Harmless: The white pills being carried by Mr Hankins were breath mints, not ecstasy

A New York man was arrested by bungling police officers who mistook his breath mints for ecstasy.

Brooklyn born Ron Hankins, 46, was stopped in the street after an NYPD officer claimed to have seen him with a bag of illegal pills.

According to police files, the officer 'observed the defendant in possession of a plastic bag containing a quantity of methylenedioxymethamphetamins.'

Mr Hankins said he was stopped without cause and then searched on the sidewalk.

He was then arrested for possession of MDMA, before being handcuffed, taken into custody and held for 30 hours.

The NYPD said the lead officer in the arrest was experienced in dealing with the confiscation of banned substances having previously identified and arrested carriers.

On this occasion the policeman believed he had correctly identified the pills as ecstasy but, upon testing, they turned out to be harmless breath mints.

Mr Hankins is now suing over his arrest, during which he claimed that he repeatedly told officers the true nature of the tablets.

The NYPD has a history of mistaking legal and edible items for drugs, another Brooklyn man was held for a day earlier this year when officers suspected his Jolly Ranchers were meth.
