A teenage girl who led a plot to trick taxi drivers into picking up masked gunmen who would rob them has been jailed.

Lucy Gardner, 19, would call taxi firms under a false name and order journeys around Birmingham.

But when the drivers arrived, Gardner, who referred to herself as Katie in the false bookings, would either be nowhere to be seen, or accompanied by men wielding handguns.

their money. She has been jailed for two-and-a-half years

After making their way inside the taxis, the masked men would beat the drivers, hold them at gunpoint and demand their money and mobile phones.

She made two attempts to fleece drivers using this scheme, but both times the men managed to drive off and leave their attackers empty-handed.

Gardener, of Redditch, Worcestershire, admitted two counts of attempted robbery in Birmingham Crown Court last week, and was jailed for two-and-a-half years.

The court heard how the first attempt was made on July 10 last year, when Gardner ordered a taxi but did not turn up to meet it.

Instead, a man climbed into the passenger seat when the car pulled up - and was soon followed by a second man with a handgun, which was pointed at the driver's face along with demands for cash.

But the taxi driver managed to escape by speeding from the scene with his car doors still open.

However, the gang made a second attempt just two days later when Gardner ordered a taxi from Beechcroft Road in Birmingham.

This time the teenager got into the passenger seat but the driver became suspicious when a masked man got into the back carrying 'something in his hand'.

He drove off causing the man to fall out of the cab and Gardner screamed until she was let out further down the road.

Police were able to trace her via her mobile phone, which contained the fake name Katie as well as potential taxi pick-up and drop-off points.

Judge Sybil Thomas told her: 'You played an integral part in two very serious offences.

'They required a young woman to be the person who lured the taxi drivers to the scene.

'You knew there was a firearm going to be produced, that it was a replica gun. It must have been simply terrifying.'

Telling the court about the first robbery, prosecutor Jason Pegg said: 'Stood outside was not Katie but a male who sat in the passenger seat.

'Both men started shouting, "Give us your money, give us your phone", the driver was punched and the passenger pulled out a Beretta-style hand-gun and pointed it at his face.

'He [the driver] was shouting, "Donâ€™t do this" to try to raise the alarm, but the males persisted. He says they were relentless.'

The court heard Gardner had fallen into 'bad company' after leaving the care of the local authority and was a 'victim of exploitation'.

Defending the teenager, Samantha Forsyth said: 'She has acknowledged the seriousness and gravity of her position and also expressed considerable remorse and regret for her actions.'

Two other men arrested over the attempted robberies were later released without charge.
