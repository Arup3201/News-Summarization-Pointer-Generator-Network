West Brom are preparing to offload their record signing Brown Ideye at a loss of £6.2million.

A price of €5m (£3.8m) has been agreed with Al Gharafa of Qatar way down from a £10m purchase price last summer.

The Nigeria striker has failed to impress at The Hawthorns, scoring just twice in all competitions - a tap-in from two yards against Hull and a deflection off the back of his head against Manchester City.

West Brom striker Brown Ideye is set for a move away from The Hawthorns after a barren five months 

The 26-year-old (right) has scored just two goals since his record £10million signing from Dynamo Kiev 

Tony Pulis needs to raise cash to plough into fresh deadline-day signings and chairman Jeremy Peace has sanctioned the knockdown fee.

Negotiations still need to be finalised over the method of payment, leaving the possibility the transfer could yet hit the buffers. 

However, much work has been done in the window to offload Ideye and all involved would like to see the move complete.

The Baggies have agreed a deal with Qatari side Al Gharafa for around £3.8m for the misfiring striker
