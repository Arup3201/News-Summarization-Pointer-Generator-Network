Even cold blooded killers can’t stand the freezing weather it seems.

The blistering cold that has most New Yorkers staying in-doors this week has also served as a crime-deterrent for the NYPD.

As of midnight on Saturday, the city reported a nine-day streak without a single murder, law-enforcement sources say.

Homicide free: New York City reported a nine-day no-murder streak as of January 26 as temperatures dropped to extreme lows, law-enforcement sources say

‘Jack Frost is the policeman’s best friend,’ one source told the New York Post. ‘The criminals are staying indoors.’

According to the Post, New York’s recorded last homicide occurred on January 16 in The Bronx, where Jennifer Rivera, 20, and her uncle, Jason Rivera, 30, were gunned down while sitting in a parked car.

Rivera had a criminal drug history, sources said. No one has been arrested in connection with those two murders, police say.

The no-homicide streak follows a similar dip in the city’s murder rate after Hurricane Sandy in late October. Both streaks mark the longest stretches of time with no killings in the city in recent memory, according to NYPD officials.

Police sources say homicides will pick back up again in the warmer months.

Happy commissioner: 'I like it,' said Police Commissioner Ray Kelly

For now, city authorities are celebrating.

‘I like it,’ New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly happily told the Post.

Kelly said cold weather and rain often impact the crime rate. ‘That’s sort of the anecdotal answer we have in policing,' he said. ‘There’s no single easy answer, but to the extent that weather played a role, we’re ready for more cold weather.’

The only potential snag in the NYPD’s no homicide run is a half-naked woman found dead in Brooklyn on Friday, which cops labeled ‘suspicious.’

However, police said that there were no obvious signs of trauma and that the city medical examiner has yet to determine the cause of her death.

New York City’s murder rate has dropped 21.7 per cent in the first few weeks of 2013 with recorded 18 murders, compared to 23 for the same period in 2012, according to city records.
