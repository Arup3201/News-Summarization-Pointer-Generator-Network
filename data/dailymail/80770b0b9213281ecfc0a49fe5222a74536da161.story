Everton boss Roberto Martinez feels the poor condition of the pitch at Dynamo Kiev's Olympic Stadium is 'a concern' - but he is sure it will be just as problematic for one side as the other in Thursday's Europa League last-16 second-leg encounter.

Rather than training on the pitch at their opponents' stadium as they normally would, Martinez' men did a session on the running track surrounding the playing surface - while the turf was covered by a protective sheet - following their arrival in Ukraine on Wednesday.

And when asked about the state of the grass, the Spaniard said at his pre-match press conference: 'The pitch is a concern for both teams.

Martinez has warned that the poor quality pitch could be a problem for both Everton and Dynamo Kiev 

'Dynamo Kiev are a technical team and they need a good pitch, and we are exactly the same.

'I don't think it will play a big part in terms of giving a favour or advantage to either of the two sides.

'I think it is a little bit of a shame for the game of football that the pitch is not going to be in perfect condition.

'But you have to adapt to whatever surface you play on.'
