The sons of an English expatriate who left his £389,000 fortune to the  British National Party are fighting to claw back the money at the High Court.

Joseph Robson, 81, died in Alicante having bequeathed his entire estate outside Spain to the far-Right BNP.

This left his two sons, Jeremy and Simon, with just £135 between them. They launched a legal challenge, insisting that their father was barred from giving money to a British political party under rules designed to prevent donations from ‘foreigners’.

Family row: Joseph Robson left his £389,000 estate to the BNP and his sons are fighting to have it for themselves claiming he lost his voting rights, making the donation illegal, the High Court heard

But the BNP is now challenging the sons’ claims in court.

Arguments: Judge Richard Sheldon heard Mr Robson left his sons just £135

Judge
Richard Sheldon QC heard that Mr Robson – who was born in Ashington, 
Northumberland – moved to Alicante after retiring in 1992.

Four
years later he made a will leaving the BNP all his worldly goods except
a Spanish bank account containing just £135, which he bequeathed to 
Jeremy.

But the BNP ran into
trouble when it tried to lay its hands on the gift, after Mr Robson’s 
sons claimed he was not legally allowed to make the donation. They 
argued that the expatriate – who divorced their mother in the 1970s – 
failed to register on the UK electoral roll in the five years before his
death in 2010, the judge heard.

That
meant he was barred from making the gift under rules introduced in 2000
to curb foreign donations to British political parties.

Phillip
Capon, for the sons, told the judge that Mr Robson effectively died 
intestate and that his whole fortune ought to be handed to them, despite
his wishes.

But Robert 
Grierson, representing BNP treasurer Clive Jefferson, argued that the 
party had overcome the problem by executing a deed of variation to the 
will. This meant the money would paid into a specially set-up charitable
trust, rather than directly to the party.

The
charity’s trustees are Mr Jefferson, former leading National Front 
member Patrick Harrington and Jennifer Matthys, the daughter of BNP 
leader Nick Griffin.

Mr 
Capon insisted, however, that moving the cash into the trust would make 
no difference and could not legitimise an ‘illegal’ political donation.

He said the party was obliged to pay the money back under the Political 
Parties Elections and Referendums Act 2000.

The BNP, represented by party Treasurer, Clive Jefferson (pictured), says the idea their father became a 'foreigner' in the eyes of the law by the time he died is inconceivable

‘The
BNP is not entitled to the gift under this will,’ he said. ‘It does not
have the lawful capacity under the Act to accept this gift. The gift 
fails and there is an intestacy.’

Mr
Capon told the court that as the party’s treasurer, Mr Jefferson could 
theoretically face prosecution if it was found to have accepted the 
payment illegally.

Addressing
the judge in person, the BNP’s Mr Harrington argued that it would be 
‘utterly unjust’ for the party to be stripped of the money bequeathed to
it. ‘One son was given nothing and the other was given less than £150,’
he said.

‘It seems pretty 
clear that the father didn’t want the bulk of his estate to go to his 
two sons – he wanted it to go to a political party.

‘Mr
Robson had every right to be on the electoral register but, for 
whatever reason, he was unaware of the provision that he had to be. The 
pathway can never lead to the sons. That can never happen.’

Denying
that the party is fighting the case as it is badly in need of  funds, 
he added: ‘The BNP has received sizeable legacies as its support base 
tends to be amongst older people. It is not desperate for money.’

Giving
his preliminary views on the dispute, Judge Sheldon said: ‘If the BNP 
had investigated whether or not Mr Robson was a permitted donor there 
would be no need for this hearing.’ He reserved his decision until a 
later date.

Neither of Mr 
Robson’s sons attended the hearing. Their barrister was unable to 
comment on why their father had decided to effectively write them out of
his will.
