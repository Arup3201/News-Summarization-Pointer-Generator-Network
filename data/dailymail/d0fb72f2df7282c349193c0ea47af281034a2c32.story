Ambulance authorities have been ordered to review their response times after it took more than 23 minutes for paramedics to arrive at the home of a three-year-old found underwater in a bath.

Parents of Emmerson Boyle, also known as Emmy, have claimed the delayed response by paramedics prevented their daughter's from surviving when she was found in a bathtub last month at her home in Gowanbrae, in north-west of Melbourne.

Paramedics arrived at the scene more than 23 minutes after the first 000 call.

Victorian ambulance target response time is 15 minutes. A spokeswoman for the Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority attributed the length of time taken to respond to the emergency call to an error in the priority coding by the triple zero operator.

Authorities are reviewing why it took paramedics from Victoria 23 minutes to respond to three-year-old Emmerson Boyle's drowning

After failed attempts of revival, Emmy died on September 2 at her family home in Gowanbrae - northwest of Melbourne

The initial call for assistance was received from Gowanbrae at about 4.39pm on September 2.

Emmy's mother, Pauline Boyle, told the Herald Sun, she left her daughter in the bathroom as she quickly ran downstairs to grab the three-year-old's favourite pink towel.

On her return, Emmy was in the bathtub. 

'I saw her hair under the bubbles. I immediately grabbed her out of the bath,' she said.

Mrs Boyle found the toddler lying facing upwards in the bath under the water, immediately pulling her out and flagging down her neighbour for help.

Mrs Boyle and her neighbour, a fireman of 25 years experience, called an ambulance and tried to revive Emmy. 

However, the phone disconnected before the neighbour could report the incident to the operator and he made the second call minutes later.

An ambulance in Preston, about 14km away, was reportedly sent before ESTA call-takers realised there was an error in the assigned priority of the call. A closer crew in Moonee Ponds, about 9km away, was then sent.

It has been confirmed that the incident was incorrectly listed as Priority 1 instead of the highest code Priority 0.

Grieving parents, Pauline and Rohan Boyle, said ambulances need to respond faster. 

'We live 14 minutes from the CBD. It would have been quicker for John and me to jump in the car and drive to the hospital ourselves,' Mrs Boyle told the Herald Sun.

'As parents we'll have to carry this burden now that our daughter might not have had the highest chance of survival.' 

Mrs Boyle said the family was not blaming paramedics but will never know if a quicker response could have saved their daughter.

'The best thing we can do moving forward is to ensure that no other families have to wait the time we waited for assistance,' Ms Boyle told reporters on Tuesday.

'Look at the photo of our daughter and see it's not a statistic, we're dealing with people's lives.' 

Emmy's father Rohan Boyle said Victoria's ambulance response times had gone backwards.

'The system did work eight years ago. They had eight-minute response times,' Mr Boyle said.

ESTA chief operations officer, Julia Oxley, said this is a 'these are very sad circumstances' and a review is underway.

'An initial error in coding this event as Priority 1 instead of Priority 0 for two minutes and 43 seconds contributed to delays in dispatching the closest ambulance,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'ESTA and Ambulance Victoria representatives have met with them to discuss in detail what happened and we are gathering more information to answer their questions.

'ESTA is also conducting a review of what happened and why. If we identify any ways we could practically improve how we respond to calls like this, we will make those changes.' 

Ms Oxley said the Inspector-General for Emergency Management has also been informed of the case.  

Emmy Boyle was found floating in a bathtub at her family home. A funeral was held for her on September 9

Ambulance Victoria's general manager, Tony Walker, said 'this is an incredibly sad case'. 

'A preliminary review indicates that the first call to triple zero came just before 4.40pm,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'Unfortunately, the call taker was unable to establish the reason for the call before the call ended and three attempts to call back were unsuccessful.'

About two minutes later, a second separate call was received by ESTA and the home address and nature of the case was attained by the operator.

'A fire crew trained to deliver CPR and defibrillation and several Advanced Life Support and MICA paramedic crews were dispatched under lights and sirens,' Mr Walker said.

'The first ambulance arrived at 5.03pm. The first ambulance had been dispatched under lights and sirens from eight kilometres away at 4.46pm.

'Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of bystanders at the scene and fire fighters and paramedics the young child was not able to be resuscitated.

'Ambulance Victoria and ESTA's review into the case is continuing and it is also the subject of a coronial enquiry.'

Premier Denis Napthine said the government had increased funding to the Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority but realised there was a need to continue improving the process.

Opposition Leader Daniel Andrews said ambulance response times are the worst they've been and the government needed to accept there was a crisis.

'To be just 14 minutes from the CBD and have to wait 23 minutes for an ambulance is not good enough, it's unacceptable,' he told reporters.

4:39.57pm 

On Tuesday, September 2, an ESTA ambulance call-taker received a call from a landline phone in Gowanbrae. The call dropped out with no voice contact while being transferred by the Telstra operator to the ESTA call-taker.

4:41.35 

An event was correctly created as a Priority 2 event based on no caller information being available and the call-taker made three attempts to call the number back but was unable to get through.

4:41.57 

A second call was received by a second ambulance call-taker. There were only two calls for an ambulance received (not multiple) plus a further one after Metropolitan Fire Brigade of Victoria were on site to check how far off the ambulance was.

4:43.28

The second ambulance call-taker updated the event to Priority 1 at this time. This was incorrect as the event should have been Priority 0.

4:45.31 

While an ambulance was dispatched from Preston, the correct coding would have allowed an ambulance that was 4.46km closer to be dispatched (Moonee Ponds) and would also have triggered a MFB crew to be sent sooner.

4:46.15 

The ambulance event was updated to the correct Priority 0 coding. Closer paramedics and ambulance unit were dispatched.

4:49.16 

Fire units arrived on scene first.

5:03.35 

The first ambulance arrived on scene and it is understood CPR instructions were provided by the call-taker throughout the call.
