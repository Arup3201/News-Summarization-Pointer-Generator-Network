Newly released police reports detailing the double murder-suicide that left a Utah mother and her two girls dead in January revealed that the woman was distraught about her broken engagement and was acting erratically in the days before the tragedy.

On January 14, Kyler Ramsdell-Oliva, 32, of Syracuse, shot dead her two daughters, 7-year-old Isabella and 13-year-old Kenadee, before turning the gun on herself inside their home.

Although the documents obtained by Desert News shed light on the circumstances surrounding the family drama, they failed to provide a clear motive for Ramsdell-Oliva's actions.

Family shooting: Police believe Kyler Ann Ramsdell-Oliva (left) fatally shot her daughters Isabella (middle) and Kenadee (right) before killing herself in a murder-suicide Tuesday evening just one day after her ex-boyfriend moved out of their house

Suburban suicide: The shooting happened around 7pm at this address in Syracuse, Utah

Ramsdell-Oliva and her fiance, 
Michael Johnson, had a turbulent relationship and spent the day before 
the murder-suicide arguing over the upbringing of his two sons from a 
previous marriage.

The 
father felt that his wife-to-be was being unreasonable with his children, 
and that she was ruining his relationship with them, according to the 
police report.

At one point during the fight, police were called to the scene, and Mr Johnson eventually decided to move out of the house.

He
 left the premises just after 4pm on January 13, but continued 
exchanging text messages with Ramsdell-Oliva for several hours.

The woman eventually stopped responding and also blocked her now ex-fiancé from her Facebook page.

The
 woman's sister would later tell police that she communicated with 
Ramsdell-Oliva via text messages until about 6pm that night. That was 
the last time she heard from her.

Michael
 Johnson turned up at their Syracuse home at around 9.30am accompanied 
by his family, who volunteered to help him move his belongings to 
Layton.

The man and his 
relatives spent hours inside the house packing his possessions, unaware 
that Ramsdell-Oliva and her two daughters’ bodies were lying inside her 
locked bedroom.

Mr Johnson 
late told officers that he knocked on the door several times asking 
Ramsdell-Oliva to move her car, but no response came.

As
 the fiancé was about to hit the road in a rented U-Haul truck, he 
recalled having a feeling that something was not right in the house.

So Johnson called his brother and his ex-fiancee's sister, and asked them to stop by the house and check up on the family.

When
 Justin Johnson opened the bedroom door after picking the lock, he 
discovered Ramsdell-Oliva's body on the floor and her two daughters dead
 from gunshot wounds on the bed.

The
 woman's sister placed a frantic 911 call, telling the dispatcher 
that Ramsdell-Oliva and her two girls were not breathing, the Standard Examiner reported earlier this month.

Unable
 to control her emotions, the sister passed the phone to Mr Johnson, who
 explained to the operator that there was a bullet casing on the floor, 
and that it appeared that Isabella and Kenadee were shot in the head.

It was later determined that the girls were shot in the chest.

Alarm bells: According to Ramsdell-Oliva's fiance, the woman once told him that if she ever decided to kill herself, she would get a gun and take her two daughters with her as well

‘They have been dead for a while,’ he said. ‘They're blue, they're cold.’

By
 the time police officers responded to the scene of the crime, a 
distressed and emotional Michael Johnson was standing outside the house 
and yelling: 'She had no right to do that to them!'

According
 to the newly released reports, Ramsdell-Oliva left a suicide note 
addressed to her sister, in which she explained why she had killed her 
daughters, but that information was not made public.

Michael Johnson said that his ex-fiancée had been suicidal, and during one 
episode she had allegedly told him that if she decided to end her life, 
she would get a gun and take her daughters with her.

The
 father of two explained that each time Ramsdell-Oliva contemplated 
killing herself, he was able to get her the professional help and 
medications she needed.

Unstable: According to the mother's boyfriend, just days before the shootings, Ramsdell-Oliva (left) had an episode in the car where she started screaming and pulling her hair

An emotional Michael Johnson, Ramsdell-Oliva's ex-fiance, was heard screaming that she had no right to kill her girls

A few days 
before the murder-suicide, Johnson recalled that the 32-year-old mother 
of two had a 'temper tantrum' in the car while the two were arguing over
 Johnson’s sons.

Mr Johnson described how Ramsdell-Oliva started screaming, pulling her hair and even threw her wedding ring out the window.

Fearing
 for Ramsdell-Oliva's emotional state, Johnson drove the hysterical 
woman to a hospital, but they never went inside and instead headed home after 
having a talk in the car.
