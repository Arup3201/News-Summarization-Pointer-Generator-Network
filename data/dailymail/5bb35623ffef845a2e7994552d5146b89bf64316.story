Three British women have undergone a revolutionary new operation to fit a 'bra' underneath the skin to combat sagging breasts.

The 'internal bras' comprise a fine hardened silicone cup placed under the breast tissue, and fine silk straps screwed into the patient's ribs to lift the breast.

They are invisible under the skin and will enable women to go bra-less.

Three women have undergone a revolutionary new breast lift operation at London's Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital. The procedure involves a surgeon implanting a silicone cup underneath the skin and screwing fine silk straps into the rib cage to life the breast tissue

More importantly, it is claimed they will not leak - welcome news after the recent PIP scandal.

The 45-minute operations, carried out at London's Guy's and St Thomas' 
Hospital, cost £6,000 - around £1,000 more than standard breast 
implants.

Leading breast surgeon Professor Jian Farhadi carried out the first three trial operations at the hospital last week.

The procedure is likely to be free to NHS patients who have had medical breast reductions and breast cancer patients, and could be routine by next year, The Sun reports.

But experts have urged caution, welcoming the new operation while calling for extensive clinical trials to examine the long-term effects on women.

Professor Kefah Mokbel of the London Breast Institute told MailOnline the procedure, which has been in development since 2007, is an 'exciting' development.

But he said it is vital that full trials are carried out to highlight any potential side-effects for patients. 

He said: 'This procedure may prove to be an effective alternative.

'This procedure is exciting but we must look at its efficacy and safety in the long term'

'It will have a real impact, I think. But people should understand it is not a quick fix.

'We don't know the long-term side effects yet. There is a need for clinical trials with adequate numbers and follow ups to prove the efficacy and safety in the long term. It is very important.

'One of the things to be looked into is if fixing silk straps to the ribs will have side effects.

'In a standard breast operation the silicone implants are inserted behind the breast to minimise the risk.

'These cups go under the skin, so the question is do we know the long-term effect to women, will they develop scaring and will the internal bra affect the shape of the breast in the long term?

'It is premature to say it is a solution to the issue of sagging breasts.'

He added that the operation may not be suitable for all women with sagging breasts.

'It has been marketed as a magical solution to address saggy breasts with very little scaring,' he added.

Experts have welcomed the new operation but called for extensive clinical trials to prove the long-term efficacy and safety of the procedure

Standard breast uplift surgery involves removing excess skin from underneath a patient's breast, or from around the area of dark tissue surrounding a woman's nipple, the areola.

Surgeons tighten the skin and breast tissue, moving the nipple to a higher position to give a firmer appearance. 

Breast enlargement or reduction surgery can be carried out at the same time.

Uplift surgery can take two to three hours, depending on the exact procedure.

It can take around four weeks to make a full recovery, but it can vary depending on the individual patient.

Typical side-effects include soreness, swelling and bruising as well as permanent scars.

Some patients can experience reduced nipple sensation.

As with all procedures the opertaion comes with warnings of complications, including infection, bleeding under the skin and unevenness in size and shape.

'But many women with saggy breasts do not just need their breast tissue lifting, they require surgery to address their skin.

'This procedure can be used alongside standard surgery when the breasts are lifted to reduce the risk of a occurrence of sagging.

'Sagging breasts depends on many factors, a women's biological constitution, the size of their breasts, their reproductive history and other factors.

'If a patient has had a proper breast lift and is concerned about the occurrence of sagging, this operation could prove effective.

'But it is unlikely to be effective on its own. It is important that a women has procedures to address the skin as well as the breast tissue itself.'

Professor Mokbel said while the new device has CE marking - which denotes it complies with EU safety, health and environmental requirements - the accreditation only refers to the actual product itself.

He said: 'CE marking only refers to the safety in the sense of the materials itself, the actual product.

'But it does not mean the procedure is safe.'

He said the operation need Food and Drug Accreditation (FDA), which looks at the efficacy of the procedure, not just the materials used.

'Yes, this procedure is exciting but we must look at its efficacy and safety in the long term.'
