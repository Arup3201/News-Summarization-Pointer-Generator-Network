Challenge: Unite General Secretary Len McCluskey has repeatedly called for industrial action

The Unite union has built a £30 million war chest to bankroll strikes in the run-up to the next election.

Leaked internal documents reveal that it has poured an extra £5 million into the fund in the last 18 months alone – seemingly paying lip service to the idea of settling disputes without industrial action.

Minutes from its board meeting last month also show that Unite – Labour’s biggest donor – is stepping up pressure on party leader Ed Miliband to relax strike laws introduced in the wake of the industrial chaos of the 1970s.

The disclosures are an embarrassment for Mr Miliband, who is attempting to curb the power of the unions and reassure business that a future Labour government would not be in their thrall in the wake of the Falkirk vote-rigging scandal.

An internal report by Unite’s finance director reveals that the union poured an extra £2.7 million into its strike fund in the first nine months of last year, despite spending just £200,000 on strike pay.

Unite revealed in 2012 that it was creating a £25 million dispute fund to prevent employers from ‘starving workers into submission’.

But the speed at which it has expanded the kitty will lead to fears about its intentions in the run-up to the election.

General secretary Len McCluskey has repeatedly called for industrial action in protest at the Government’s austerity programme. He has said he sees ‘disputes unfolding all over the place’, claiming the union needs financial clout to ‘fight back’.

Unite has also said it needs the resources to demonstrate to employers that it ‘means business’ when it orders a walkout, allowing it to provide £30 a day in strike pay for workers involved in disputes.

Most controversially, the cash is also used to fund Unite’s sinister ‘leverage tactics’, which sparked controversy last year when it sent mobs of protesters to demonstrate outside the homes of directors of the Grangemouth oil refinery.

Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said: 'We need security, not strikes... Unless Ed Miliband gets his biggest union paymaster to act responsibly, it will be clear he's too weak to stand up for hard-working people'

In the documents, Unite’s political director Jenny Formby welcomed Mr Miliband’s clear shift to the Left, but warned that ‘significant work’ was still needed to tackle current strike policies and to build positive trade union ‘rights and freedoms’.

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps last night condemned the apparent bid by Unite to ready itself for a wave of strikes. ‘We need security, not strikes,’ he said. ‘Unless Ed Miliband gets his biggest union paymaster to act responsibly, it will be clear he’s too weak to stand up for hard-working people.’

Tory MP David Morris, deputy chairman of the Campaign for Trade Union Reform, said Unite should stop its ‘highly political’ activity. The revelations come as Mr Miliband prepares to make a major climbdown following Unite’s refusal to accept reforms to curb the power of the unions.

Proposals to end the controversial system in which many union members are automatically signed up as Labour ‘affiliates’ have now been delayed for at least five years. A ‘special conference’ planned for March will now last just two hours.

Unite last night insisted the expansion of the strike fund did not mean it was planning a fresh wave of industrial action.

A spokesman said: ‘Nine times out of ten disputes are resolved and industrial action avoided through negotiation with sensible employers.

The dispute fund is there to cover things such as legal costs and support for members on those rare occasions when industrial action does occur.’
