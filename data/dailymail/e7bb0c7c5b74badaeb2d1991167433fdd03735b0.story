Heartless: Dr Raihan Chowdhury, pictured, was arrested after six years on the run when his plane landed in Virginia last month

America's most wanted deadbeat dad has been arrested after skipping the country owing his estranged wife $1.6 million in child support payments and divorce settlements.

Raiham Chowdhury, 51, a wealthy doctor from Brooklyn, ditched his wife and kids and fled to Bangladesh in 2006, leaving them homeless.

But after six years on the lam, he is now in jail after investigators who have been following his every move handcuffed him as his plane touched down at Dulles airport in Virginia last month.

'We knew he was coming,' Thomas O'Donnell, an agent with the inspector general of the US Department of Health and Human Services, told The New York Post.

'He was quiet, almost like he knew. He was probably just saying, 'I'll slip through the cracks and get in.''

In late 2005, the doctor secretly sold his family's $975,000 home in south Midwood and liquidated all his assets.

In January 2006, Chowdhury disappeared after a family holiday to Disneyland in Hong Kong.

His wife, Sharmin, and three kids — then ages 8, 6 and 2 — returned to an empty home after Chowdhury organised for a friend to remove the furniture as well as Sharmin's medical diploma and her jewellery.

When the property's new owners showed up, Sharmin was forced to move to a homeless shelter with her young family.

The betrayed wife filed for divorce but soon learned her husband was even more of a scoundrel than she first thought. 'He claimed he'd obtained a divorce in Bangladesh and remarried,' Laurence Greenberg, her lawyer, told the Post.

Chowdhury had been living it up in the Bangladesh capital of Dhaka ever since, during which time he's racked up the massive $1.6 million, Mr Greenberg said.

'He's been living with his new wife in Dhaka in a luxury apartment in the most expensive part of town.'

Previously a gynecologist before she 
got married, Sharmin found a job as a physician's assistant and 
eventually got an apartment. According to the Post, the children are now
public-school honor students.

Despite
pocketing $280,000 a year as an anesthesiologist at Maimonides Medical 
Center in Brooklyn and having his fingers in other lucrative pies, 
Chowdhury has been ignoring $9,680 a month in support.

He
was also ordered to split the family home 50-50 with his wife in the 
divorce settlement last year, which adds $1 million to his support 
payments.

The runaway was indicted as a fugitive by the FBI after Mr Greenberg alerted the Child Support Enforcement of the Human Resources Administration to Chowdhury's growing debt.

Chowdhury was arraigned on October 15, and a judge set bail at $500,000 bail but he couldn't come up with the money so is being held in an Alexandria, Virginia, prison.

'We never expected him to come back,' Mr Greenberg told the newspaper.

Mr O'Donnell added: 'He's a despicable human being. In the end, we're trying to get money back to the kids.'
