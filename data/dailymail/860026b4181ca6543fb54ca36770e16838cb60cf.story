Unseen FBI interviews have been released showing a newlywed confessing to pushing her husband of eight days off a cliff as they argued about her second thoughts about the marriage.

Jordan Graham, from Montana, told an FBI agent what really happened on top of of a cliff in Glacier National Park after days of lying. She admitted second degree murder last week.

'He
 went to grab my arm and my jacket and I said no, I said I'm not going 
to let this happen this time, I'm going to defend myself. So I let go 
and I pushed and he went over and then I took off and went home,' she 
said in the FBI recording.

Graham,
 22, said she decided to talk to Johnson, 25, about her unhappiness 
eight days after their wedding. So on the evening of July 7, just about 
sunset, the couple went to a popular spot in Glacier Park called The 
Loop.

First story: Two days after Cody Johnson went missing, his wife Jordan Graham told police that he went on a joyride with friends from out of town

New lead: The next day, she went to the police station with her mom and told them about a fake email from a person named 'Tony' that she received, when really she created the account herself

They went over a 
retaining wall along the Going-to-the-Sun Road and climbed down a rocky,
 steep slope to the edge of a cliff and a steep drop of a couple hundred
 feet to a ravine.

There, facing the void, she told 
Johnson that she wasn't really happy and that she was not feeling like 
she believed she ought to after being married, she said.

They argued. It escalated, culminating with Johnson grabbing her, Graham said. She thought he was going to pull her toward him.

That's when she became angry, she said.

'I wasn't thinking about where we were,' she said. 'I just pushed.'

She
 said she brushed away his hand and then pushed her new husband with one
 hand on his back and one hand on his shoulder, and he went over.

It wasn't planned, but she said it was 'definitely reckless with an extreme disregard' for life.

Hearing her words back: More than a week after her husband died, Jordan Graham was interviewed by FBI officers and she is heard on tape saying that she 'pushed him and took off'

Afterward, she ran back to where the car was parked. She had the keys in her pocket.

She
 drove back home to Kalispell, about an hour away, without seeking help.
 She sent text messages to friends on the drive back - but told nobody 
what had just happened.

'At that moment, I was so scared, I didn't know what to do,' she said.

On Thursday, Graham, 22, changed her 
initial not guilty plea and admitted that she did push her husband to 
his death, accepting a lesser second degree sentence.

Before
 tragedy: Graham is pictured with 25-year-old Cody Johnson, whom she 
married in June. Johnson's mother testified in the trial that her son 
had been excited to marry Graham

Cutting a deal: Graham and her attorneys surprised prosecutors by agreeing to the plea deal of second degree murder after just four days of the trial

The
 prosecution was planning on showing the taped interviews with the court
 room but since she accepted the plea, the jurors did not have to 
consider the evidence.Â 

Graham had initially told police officers that her new husband had gone out of town.

'He
 was going to go for a ride with some of his out of town buddies that 
were visiting,' she told police while being interviewed wearing a bright
 yellow dress.

'I don't know anything more.'

That
 really wasn't the case, as she came back to talk to police again the 
next day after reportedly receiving an email from a mysterious man named
 Tony telling her not to drop the investigation.

Police later determined that the email address was created on her step father's computer.

Before closing arguments were about to begin, the attorneys for both sides announced the surprise agreement: Graham would plead guilty to second-degree murder, and prosecutors would drop the first-degree murder charge and the false statement charge.

Second-degree murder carries a maximum sentence of life in prison and a $250,000 fine.

She is scheduled to be sentenced on March 27.
