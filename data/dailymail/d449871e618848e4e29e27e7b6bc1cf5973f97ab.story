A couple who moved to France from Britain for a ‘dream retirement’ have been found shot dead in their home in their picturesque Pyrenean village. 

Derek Hawkins, 98, is thought to have blasted his wife Sheila, 86, to death with a .22 calibre rifle before turning the weapon on himself. 

He is said to have told his therapist he was ‘morally tired’ and ‘if I go, it won’t be alone.’

The suspected suicide pact is likely to have happened because of the couple’s advanced age, local investigators believe. 

A cleaning lady found the body early on Monday morning in Fabas, not far from Toulouse, in the Ariege department in the foothills of the Pyrenees. 

The Hawkins moved to the village, which has a population of less than 250, in the 1980s and ‘often spoken about their dream retirement’, said a near neighbour. 

He added: ‘They were a lovely couple who raised Dachshunds, and they got on extremely well with everybody.’ 

But, as they got older, life appeared to be getting much harder for both, said the neighbour. The gun was found close to Mr Hawkins, who originally came from the USA, while Mrs Hawkins, who was British, had a single wound to her body. 

An autopsy will be held in Toulouse today, and detectives are currently working on the theory that the husband ‘killed his wife and then turned the gun on himself.’

Police from Sainte-Croix-Volvestre are investigating, with Foix prosecutor Geraldine Labialle saying: ‘Suicide is the most likely track. There was no sign of a struggle. 

‘Mr Hawkins is thought to have told his therapist he was tired of everything, and if he went it would not be alone.’ 

Nobody else is being searched for in connection with the tragedy. 

In 2010, the Hawkins were involved in a fire drama, when the large barn in which they kep their dogs burned down overnight. 

Simon Bavard, the mayor of Fabas, said: ‘They moved here around thirty years ago, and were very well integrated. 

‘Despite their age, they continued to live on their old farm house just on the outskirts of the village.’
