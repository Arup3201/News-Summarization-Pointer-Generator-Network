A leisurely lunchtime stroll took an unexpected and amusing turn for the worst when a man became stuck in a sinkhole for 40 minutes, prompting an unlikely rescue operation.

Eduardo de la Fuente, 47, was walking along West Beach in Adelaide when his ankle sank into the boggy sand just metres from the local Life Saving Club.

With the tide going out, three surfers were forced to call for help when they failed to free him with their boards .

He described the situation as 'comical' yet 'scary.'

'It was scary because I could not move and the water was rushing over me at times,' he told advertiser.com.au.

'Luckily the tide was going out. If it had been closer to dark it could have been quite dangerous.'

The surfers soon realised it was a job for professionals and rushed to the surf life saving club, where staff contacted emergency services.

'Luckily they did not make any jokes at my expense,' he said.

'I’m feeling a bit stupid.'

Mr de la Fuente said he chose not tell his 19-week pregnant wife about the unusual incident.

'I just said ‘come and pick me up but there may be some special ops and police here’,' he said.

He urged the local council to install warning signs 'as a matter of urgency' to prevent anyone else from suffering the same fate.

'You see stories of quick sand at the movies but you don’t expect it at your local beach when you go for a stroll,' he said.

Mr de la Fuente calmed the nerves with a much-deserved glass of single malt whiskey when he got home.
