This is the skeletal condition of a Great Dane who was starved to the brink of death by her cruel owner.

The animal, named Roxy, was discovered living in filthy conditions by RSPCA inspectors at a house in Downham Market, Norfolk.

She was so badly emaciated that she had lost half of her weight - with a waist of just 18 inches.

Thin: The animal was discovered living in filthy conditions by RSPCA inspectors at a house in Downham Market, Norfolk. She had long unclipped nails, faeces smeared across her coat and ears and her waist had shrunk

She also had long unclipped nails and faeces smeared across her coat and the insides of her ears.

Now, her owner Samantha Clark, 32, has been banned from keeping dogs for five years after pleading guilty to neglect at King's Lynn Magistrates' Court.

Roxy was rescued and taken into care by the RSPCA in November 2012 after a concerned neighbour alerted the charity to her plight, the court heard.

RSPCA inspector Richard Lythgoe said a vet had confirmed the dog was extremely underweight, dehydrated and suffering from general neglect.

'Poor Roxy had been utterly neglected,' he said. 'The
 vet found no signs of any condition which would have caused her to be 
so underweight - so she must have just not been given proper food for quite some time.

'All the signs were that she had been left living in filthy conditions with very little care or attention.

'It is hard to comprehend but I think the door was shut on this dog and she was just forgotten about.'

Healthy again: Roxy was rescued and taken into care by the RSPCA in November 2012 after a neighbour alerted the charity to her plight. In the 18 months since she was rescued, she has regained her weight (pictured)

Looking for a family: Roxy, pictured following her recovery, will soon be ready to be rehomed to a new family

He added: 'I am very pleased a ban has been put in place - hopefully this will stop other animals from suffering.'

In the 18 months since she was rescued, Roxy has regained her weight and will soon be ready to be rehomed.

Clark was also ordered to pay £1,500 in costs, a £20 victim surcharge and a fine of £220.
