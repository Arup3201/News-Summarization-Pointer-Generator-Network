Patriotic Scots have been flocking to a tattoo parlour in Kirkcaldy to get free ‘YES’ logos inked on their bodies.

Aphra Wilson, owner of Spaghetti Tattoos, has been inundated with requests by customers who want to show their support for the campaign for independence. 

Ms Wilson, who is a passionate supporter of of the Yes campaign, began offering the tattoos in June after inking herself with the word ‘YES’.

She then got dozens of responses on Facebook from customers who wanted similar designs.

She eventually decided to invite anyone who wanted a pro-independence tattoo to come along and get one for a donation of £2 to a local Yes campaign headquarters.

Ms Wilson’s shop is adorned with posters supporting the Yes campaign and voters have now been queuing outside her shop to have her designs tattooed on themselves.

She said that she has been campaigning herself for the Yes vote. 

She said: ‘Over the last few months I have just become increasingly passionate about it, and find out as much as I can about it to pass that information to other people.

‘I got a Yes tattoo myself, which got a phenomenal response on Facebook. From that another two guys got in touch with me to get similar tattoos.

‘It snowballed from there. All the money that is made will be given to Yes campaign.

‘A Yes campaigner came round with lots of leaflets, stickers and information to give away, so everyone that comes in to the shop to get a tattoo can take that away with them and read up on it as well.’

One of the first customers to get one of Ms Wilson’s tattoos was 19-year-old Camilla Wilkinson.

She told the Buzzffed website that there was friction between her and the rest of her family, who are voting No to independence. She got a tattoo of a saltire butterfly behind her ear.

Her father, who is from Belfast, believes that Scotland should be part of the UK and she said she would not tell him about her tattoo.

‘He would probably disown me,’ she said. ‘We just don’t talk about the referendum.’

Alastair MacNab, 57, got the word YES tattooed in block capital letters during a visit to the tattoo parlour on his birthday. 

He said his stepdaughter suggested he get the tattoo to publicly show his support. He said: ‘I thought, why not?’

He told Buzzfeed that most of his family had got similar tattoos, although his stepdaughter had decided against it. ‘I don’t like the idea of getting the same tattoo as everyone else,’ she said.

Scot Tracy Cunningham, 36, brought her two children before all three got tattoos.

Ann Gillon, 23, got a butterfly in the colours of the Saltire, explaining she had decided to support the Yes campaign after learning that Britain’s Trident nuclear programme is based in Scotland.

She said Scottish people should have a choice in the matter. Her boyfriend Peter Anderson also got the same tattoo inked behind his ear.

Rhiannon Kennedy, 24, got her third pro-independence tattoo at Ms Wilson’s parlour, revealing she returned to the shop each time the owner announced she was offering the £2 tattoos since June.
