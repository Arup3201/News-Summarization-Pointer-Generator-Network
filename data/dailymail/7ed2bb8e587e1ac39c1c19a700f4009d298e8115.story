She's the first lady of fashion who worked as creative director of Smythson and often sits front row at the biggest shows, but it seems that Samantha Cameron has been taking style inspiration from her husband.

Samantha, 43, was sporting a more androgynous style than usual as she and the Prime Minister  arrived in Birmingham ahead of the Conservative Party Conference.

Wearing a pinstriped blue and white shirt, not dissimilar to the one her husband David was sporting, dark cord trousers and navy heels, the mother-of-three exuded an understated yet chic style.

Trendsetter? Samantha Cameron is well-known in the industry for her sartorial wardrobe choices and as she arrived with husband David ahead of the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, she rocked an androgynous style 

While fashion editors have quietly been championing mannish shirts for months, are we ready for cords to make a comeback from the 90s?

Christopher Tennant, style writer at the Wall Street Journal, said: 'Banish all thoughts of preppy high-schoolers and '70s flares. Corduroy is cultivating a more refined air.

'Corduroy can be groovily retro or preppy and professorial. It has a reputation as a bit of a workaday fabric, but good, 100 per cent cotton corduroy is like velvet in its richness and is fantastic to work with.'

It's a man's world: Crisp tailored shirts and trousers have been the fash-pack's wardrobe essentials so far this season and it seems that Mrs Cameron has taken note 

Androgynous dressing is certainly the style de rigeur. The high street has witnessed sales of trouser suits soar by 157 per cent after recent awards ceremonies such as the Baftas and the Oscars, where fashion's finest were championing the trend.

Style icons Cara Delevingne, Kourtney Kardashian, Madonna and Ellen Degeneres have been embracing the manly look since the start of the year and the red carpets were blanketed in ladies’ tuxes. 

Androgynous dressing is back on the style agenda but that doesn’t mean you have to look manly.

'Clean-lined suits with cuts in the right places can look feminine and flattering as shown at Jil Sander, Tods and Versace,' said fashion blogger Lydia Faye Jones.

Although the look has been a celebrity favourite on the red carpet, it has crossed over into everyday wear with sales of plain black and navy trouser suits up by 157 per cent along with white shirts increasing by 105 per cent at Debenhams.

Fashionista: Samantha often wins over style critics for her love of mixing high end designer, such as Roksanda Ilincic, Erdem and Phillip Lim - with high street options such as Zara and L.K. Bennett

Clearly Samantha, who quickly became  an ambassador for British style when husband David  was made Prime Minister in May 2010, is up-to-date with the trends (her sister does work for Vogue, after all).

She often wins over style critics for her love of mixing  high end designer, such as Roksanda Ilincic, Erdem and Phillip Lim - with high street options such as Zara and L.K. Bennett. She also hosts a party at Downing Street every season to celebrate London fashion week, with this year's esteemed guests including Cara Delevingne and Kate Moss.

The Prime Minister and his wife may have been all smiles on arrival last night, but David Cameron today vented his frustration at the chaotic start to his Tory party conference, overshadowed by the defection of a second MP to UKIP and a minister quitting in a sleaze scandal.

The Prime Minister sought to focus voters' attention on the next election being a straight choice between him or Ed Miliband standing on the steps of Number 10, but admitted: 'It's not been the best start.'

But he faces spending the week dogged by questions about how many more Conservatives will switch to UKIP in the coming days and weeks, in protest at his policies on Europe and immigration.

The Tories have been plunged into crisis on the first day of their annual gathering in Birmingham.

Mark Reckless yesterday stunned the Tory leadership by announcing he was joining UKIP, despite spending the last two weeks repeatedly denying he planned to do so.

And hours after UKIP leader Nigel Farage paraded his newest recruit, it emerged charities minister Brooks Newmark had been forced to quit over allegations he sent explicit photographs of himself to a woman - who was actually an undercover reporter.

The married father-of-five today admitted he had been a 'complete fool' but pleaded for privacy for his family.

Mr Cameron had hoped to focus attention on plans to curb benefits for the under-25s, but has been blown off course by events beyond his control

The Prime Minister today revealed his anger at the double blow to his party's image in a live TV interview.

He told the BBC's Andrew Marr: 'I have to admit it has not been an ideal start.'
