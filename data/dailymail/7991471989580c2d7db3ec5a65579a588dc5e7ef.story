The 49-year-old man who was shot dead by police after firing about 200 rounds in downtown Austin and attempted to burn the Mexican Consulate was a 'homegrown, American extremist'.

Larry McQuilliams was a 'terrorist' who harbored extremist right-wing views, and appeared to be planning a broader attack against churches and government facilities, Austin police have said.

Convicted bank robber McQuilliams went on a rampage in Austin in the early hours of Friday, carrying  multiple weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.

'Terrorist': Larry McQuilliams, 49, was shot dead by police after firing about 200 rounds and attempting arson on the Mexican Consulate in downtown Austin around 2.30am Friday

McQuilliams, started his attack on the Mexican Consulate building and a federal courthouse shortly after 2.20am.

After firing about 200 rounds, he was killed by a single shot to the chest from a police officer as he shot at police headquarters. 

Written in marker on his chest were the words, 'Let me die,' Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo said. 

When police searched his rented van they found books associated with a right-wing Christian sect known as the Phineas Priesthood, which holds extremist, anti-Semitic and racist views.

Police found a copy of 'Vigilantes of Christendom,' a book describes the Phineas Priesthood as Christian guerrillas who avenge Judeo-Christian traitors. 

When police searched McQuilliams van they found evidence that he was associated with the Phineas Priesthood, a right-wing Christian sect which holds extremist, anti-Semitic and racist views

Inside the book was a handwritten note that referred to McQuilliams as a 'priest in the fight against anti-God people,' Acevedo said. 

Officers who searched his home found a map of 34 downtown buildings that likely were potential targets of further attacks, including two churches.

Investigators said McQuilliams left no note describing a specific motive or why he picked his targets.

Christopher Combs, FBI special agent in charge of the San Antonio division, which includes Austin, also noted that some people who knew McQuilliams told investigators he'd been upset that he couldn't find a job and believed immigrants were given more services than he was.

City and federal investigators say they are confident McQuilliams acted alone.

'No one helped him. There's not a larger conspiracy at all,' said Combs. 

'The one mistake he made was he came to the Austin police station and we were able to take him out pretty quickly,' Acevedo said, describing McQuilliams as a 'homegrown, American extremist' and 'terrorist.'

McQuilliams had rented a van that was parked outside the police station and was loaded with ammunition and propone fuel canisters typically used for camping.

McQuilliams tried to use fireworks with the canisters to make crude but ineffective bombs and used some at the Mexican Consulate, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished.

McQuilliams had served about seven years in federal prison for bank robbery and was released in 2000. As a convicted felon, he could not legally possess the firearms he used in his attack. Acevedo said investigators are still trying to determine how he got them.
