The upscale Manhattan penthouse that legendary crooner Frank Sinatra had once called home finally has a new owner nine months after it was put up for sale.

The sleek 3,200-square-foot, four-bedroom duplex at 530 East 72nd Street, which Andy Warhol dubbed the 'glittering grotto in the sky,' was reportedly sold for $5.49million to the daughter a Chinese tech titan.

The name of the home's new owner has not been disclosed.

The original asking price had been set at $7.7million when the co-op was first put on the market back in August by Rubicon Property founder Jason Haber and real estate broker Gregory Spock.

Until recently, the former Rat Pack 
pad belonged to Penny Hart, president of Tri-State Consumer Insurance, 
who purchased it for 'only' $2.3million in 2010.

The swanky pad features many appealing features, including two wrap-around terraces overlooking the East River and FDR Drive, 18-foot ceilings, solar panels and a putting green.

During a massive renovation in 2008, a few modern touches were added to the place, including the same futuristic glass staircase as the one in the Apple stores, according to the New York Observer.

The duplex was the setting for many a swinging party, even attracting the likes of President John F Kennedy and Hollywood sex symbol Marilyn Monroe.

Design: Frank Sinatra helped to design the place, pictured, and lived there from 1961 to 1972, but these days it looks quite a bit different

After
divorcing second wife Ava Gardner in 1957, Sinatra snapped up the 
duplex, which occupies the 22nd and 23rd floors, and the space was 
transformed into a four-bedroom, six-bathroom apartment worthy of Ol' Blue Eyes himself.

Sinatra helped design his luxurious duplex and construction was completed in 1961. The singer called it home until 1972.

Sinatra met, married and then divorced Mia Farrow while living there.

The jewel in the penthouse's crown was a glassed-in, rooftop party room
where guests would mingle under 18-foot ceilings and enjoy sweeping 
views of the river.

Another majorÂ  draw is the two wraparound terraces totaling 2,000 sq ft.

His star-studded guest-list often included fellow Rat Packers Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop.

It is even claimed that Davis used to enjoy throwing empty champagne glasses from the terrace onto the street.

One party included appearances from President Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe and avant garde artist Andy Warhol.

He also used the large party space to work on his vocals when he wasn't entertaining, Haber added.

The singer sold the apartment in 1972 to his personal physician, celebrity doctor Denton Cox, whose other clients included Judy Garland and Warhol.

When Cox died his estate was sold to insurance magnate Penny Hart in 2008 for $4.5million.

Because Cox had done very little to maintain the penthouse, Hart made many renovations and turned a section of Sinatra's legendary party space into the master bedroom.
