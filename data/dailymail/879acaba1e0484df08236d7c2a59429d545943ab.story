Wales' Francesca Jones finished her competitive rhythmic gymnastics career by winning her first Commonwealth gold and five silver medals at her third and final Games in Glasgow.

The 23-year-old claimed gold in the last final of the competition with the ribbon after winning silver medals in the hoop, ball and clubs to follow up Friday's individual all-around and Thursday's team success.

Speaking on BBC One ,she said: 'It is beyond words. I have had the most amazing few days, I literally can't believe that we just got to have the Welsh flag flying - it is phenomenal, I am so proud of myself.

Golden girl: Francesca Jones receives the first Commonwealth Games gold of her career in her final event

Career high: Welsh gymnast Francesca Jones won gold in the ribbon final on Saturday afternoon

What a way to go: Jones had already won five silver medals before her victory with the ribbon

'Everybody who supported me to get 
here - Sport Wales, Welsh Gymnastics, my coaches - they have been here 
every step of the way and I would not be here today without all of 
them.'

Jones' team-mate Laura Halford added to her all-around bronze by winning the same colour medal in the ball final.

Canada's Patricia Bezzoubenko looked set to take a clean sweep of all six golds on offer at the Hydro including in the team event and all-around in what was a dominant performance, only for Jones to see off her challenge after a stunning routine.

Jones scored 14.500 with the ribbon but had to wait to find out if the gold was hers after Bezzoubenko, the penultimate gymnast to perform, launched an enquiry into her score of 13.800.

The appeal was rejected meaning the gold went to Wales, with Malaysia's Wong Poh San taking silver with 14.250 and Bezzoubenko bronze.

Jones, who also won silver with the hoop in the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games, was beaten to top spot in the first final of the day by Bezzoubenko, who won her third gold with a routine of 14.800 with the apparatus.

Jones took second place just 0.05 marks behind Bezzoubenko with 14.750, while Poh San won bronze with 14.650.

The Welsh gymnast then added to her silver collection and Halford claimed bronze in the second final of the day with the ball.

Bezzoubenko
 claimed her fourth gold medal of the event with a routine of 15.250 
ahead of Jones who won her fourth silver with a routine of 14.875, while
 team-mate Halford won bronze with 14.550.

Jones would have claimed gold but for
 the dominance of Bezzoubenko, who was the last gymnast out and 
performed an impressive routine which well surpassed her mark in 
qualifying.

The Canadian won her fifth gold shortly after with a 15.350 score in the clubs final.

Bezzoubenko's
 dominance could not be halted by Jones, who claimed her fifth silver 
behind the 17-year-old after being awarded a mark of 14.800, while 
Cyprus' Themida Christodouli took bronze after being the first to 
perform a routine which scored 14.300.

In
 the last apparatus final, Jones held the lead at the midway point after
 a beautiful ribbon performance that scored 14.500, with Halford out of 
the medals with a score of 12.850.

Hoop dreams: Jones has three silvers at the Glasgow Games after her second place in the hoop final

England's
 Lynne Hutchison produced a routine of 13.550 but slipped out of the top
 three, with Bezzoubenko the penultimate gymnast to perform.

The Canadian scored 13.800 to leave Jones waiting for South Africa's Grace Legote's score to find out if the gold was hers.

Legote
 was awarded a mark of 13.100 but Jones was forced to wait to see if she
 was destined for the top step on the podium following an enquiry by 
Bezzoubenko.

The enquiry was rejected meaning Jones finished off her lengthy career on a gold-medal high.
