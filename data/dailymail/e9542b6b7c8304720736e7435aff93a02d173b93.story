Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) is spearheading a class action
lawsuit against the government over NSA spy programs.

The lawsuit’s announcement comes only hours after the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court renewed the government’s permission Friday to collect bulk telephone
metadata.

Mr Paul claimed that several hundred thousand people have
already signed up for the suit that he hopes will be reviewed by the U.S.
Supreme Court – perhaps an inevitability after courts have issued differing District
Court rulings on the constitutionality of the program.

Announcing the suit: Senator Rand paul (R-KY) spoke about the lawsuit in a Friday night appearance on Fox News

The Senator contended told Fox News that
to applying a single warrant to millions of people is unconstitutional and that
questions of constitutionality should not be decided by the secretive FISA
court.

‘The question here is whether or not you can have a single
warrant applied to millions of people,’ Mr Paul said before explaining that
anyone with a cell phone is eligible to sign up.

‘No you can’t have our records without our permission or
without a warrant specific to an individual.’

The government quietly announced in a Friday afternoon
statement from Director of National Intelligence James Clapper’s office that
the surveillance program has been renewed.

The statement also included defense of the spy program’s
legality, perhaps in an attempt to head Mr Paul’s lawsuit off at the pass.

Suing the NSA: Senator Paul's Facebook page touts the lawsuit, which he says hundreds of thousands of people have joined

Citing the rulings of judges in US District Courts in the
Southern Districts of both California and New York, as well as 16 FISA court
judges on 36 occasions, the government claimed the program is lawful.

Mr Paul disagreed, saying that Americans should not have to
trade their Fourth Amendment rights for protections against terrorism.

‘We think we can have security that we can defend against
terrorism, but that doesn’t mean that every individual American has to give up
their privacy,’ he said.

Mr Paul may have a case after U.S. District Court Judge
Richard Leon ruled last month in Washington, D.C., that the program was
unconstitutional, and ordered the removal of the records of two individuals.

'I am not convinced at this point in the litigation that the NSA’s database has ever truly served the purpose of rapidly identifying terrorists in time-sensitive investigations,' Judge Leon wrote in his ruling, according to NBC News.

Anyone with a cell phone: Mr Paul says anyone with a cell phone is eligible to join the lawsuit

The government surveillance program collects telephone
metadata – who calls, when they call and for how long. Contents of conversations
are not recorded, the government has repeatedly claimed.

Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli is the lead
counsel for the class action lawsuit, Mr Paul said. He previously sued the feds
over the constitutionality of Obamacare.

Outrage at the NSA and other agencies has reached a fever
pitch in the last six months after former government contractor Edward Snowden
fled the country with a series of documents detailing how the US government
spies both domestically and abroad.

The announcement the FISA court approved the hearing was notably
made public without any further details – it is not known what the actual
ruling stipulated.
