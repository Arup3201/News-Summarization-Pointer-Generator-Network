A Home Depot worker has shot to fame after a nine-second video of him catching a baby who fell out of a shopping cart went viral.

Christopher Strickland caught a baby girl as she rolled out of a shopping cart at the South Anchorage Home Depot in Alaska.

If he hadn't been there, she would have hit the concrete floor with a bang.

Home Depot worker Christopher Strickland, 19, was doing his job when he noticed the baby on a shopping cart

The 19-year-old only graduated from Grace Christian School in the spring and has been working at Home Depot, his first job, for just three months.

But already he's a hero in his place of work.

Mr Strickland said he was hanging around the cashier
 area waiting for a customer when he noticed a baby loose in a car seat,
 balanced atop an orange shopping cart.

'I thought I'd keep an eye on it, in case something happened,' he told the Anchorage Daily News.

As the baby rolled over Mr Strickland dived into action, leaping to his left to catch the baby. He then cradled her in his arms

The baby began to tip out of the car 
seat and Strickland rushed towards it and caught the baby in mid-air and cradled it.

Strickland then handed the child to the father, who had been distracted at the cash register. The man thanked him repeatedly before leaving.

The incident was caught on Home Depot surveillance camera and found its way onto the internet, including the Facebook page of Strickland's church, Jewel Lake Community Church.

Three days ago Mr Strickland's brother, Dale, put it on 
YouTube, titling it 'Chris to the rescue,' and adding the 
description 'my brother saving a baby falling off a cart
 at home depot' below.

It quickly went viral and has already had 164,000 hits. On LiveLeak it has had more than 310,000 hits.
