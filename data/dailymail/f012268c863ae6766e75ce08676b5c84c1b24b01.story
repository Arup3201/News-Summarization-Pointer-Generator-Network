This graphic shows the average commuting times for men and women across Britain. A TUC study published today showed that on average, commuters spend more than five weeks a year travelling to work

The study by the TUC showed that most ordinary commuters in the UK spends 
52.8 minutes every day on the train, bus or car.

While men might spend longer getting to work than women, they have 
seen their commute fall by 0.2 minutes since 2006.

TUC General Secretary 
Brendan Barber: 'With rising transport costs far 
outstripping pay rises, reducing the number of peak-time commutes would 
save both time and money for hard-pressed workers.

'Recent
 trends suggest there is a link between long commute times and longer 
hours in the office, with the growing number of men in part-time work 
having shorter journeys to work.'

The TUC study showed that commuting times have fallen nationally over the last six years for men, but commuting time for women across the country has increased

Women in London now take longer to get to work than men working anywhere other than the capital

While commuting times have fallen nationally
 over the last six years for men, the spent time travelling by women across 
the country has increased by 0.6 minutes to 47.4 minutes a day.

Commuting times for women also increased 
sharply in Scotland, up 3.2 minutes to 46.8 minutes, while men in Wales 
have seen their commute time drop by 4.6 minutes since 2006.

Workers in Wales have the shortest commute, at an average of just 41.4 minutes.

Welsh workers had the shortest commuting time, and men in Wales have seen their commute time drop by 4.6 minutes since 2006.

The TUC study, an analysis of official figures from the government's Labour Force survey, was published today to mark the start of Work Wise UK's Commute Smart week.

Commuting is also set to get more expensive next year, as rail passengers will face fare hikes of up to 11 per cent, adding hundreds of pounds to the cost of annual season tickets. Season ticket fares to London will cost some commuters in excess of £6,000.

From January 1, train firms can increase their ‘regulated’ fares, including rush-hour commuter tickets and off-peak fares, by three percentage points more than the retail price index inflation figure of 3.2 per cent for last July.

The train companies also have the flexibility to add another 5 per cent to respond to changes in demand for particular services – meaning some fares could rise by as much as 11.2 per cent.

Rail fares have risen by more than inflation every year for the past decade.5.8 for women

In London, fares for the bus and Tube are set to rise by an average of 4.2% from January 2, and even cycling commuters who make use of Boris Bikes could feel the pinch.

A yearly membership for the capital's cycle hire scheme is set to double, from £45 to £90.

In a speech to working parents in 
London today, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg emphasised the importance
 of flexible working hours and announced that from 2015, the UK will 
shift to an entirely new system of flexible parental leave.

'Under the new rules, a mother will be able to trigger flexible leave at any point, if and when she feels ready,' he said.

'That means that whatever time is left to run on her original year can be taken by her partner instead.'

The Lib Dem leader also confirmed a new legal right for men to take unpaid leave  in order to attend two antenatal appointments.

'Lots of fathers will tell you that these moments are when it can start to feel real for them,' the Deputy Prime Minister said.

'Whether
 that’s at the 12 week scan – the first time they see their child on a 
screen – or a bit further down the track, when they can find out if 
they’re having a girl or a boy.

'This new right means no father will ever
 need to miss out.'
