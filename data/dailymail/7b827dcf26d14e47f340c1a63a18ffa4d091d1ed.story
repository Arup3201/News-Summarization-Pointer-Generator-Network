Locked up: Ricky R. Weeden has been sentenced to five years behind bars for a 2012 hit-and-run

A man who has been arrested 150 times for driving violations has been sentenced to just five years in prison for a hit-and-run that killed a four-year-old boy.

Ricky R. Weeden Sr., 56, whose arrests include drunken driving, speeding, reckless driving and driving without a license since his was revoked in 1993, struck a plea deal in St Louis County, Missouri on Friday for his most recent charges - involuntary manslaughter and fleeing the scene of a fatal crash.

Weeden, who killed two other young people in a previous car crash in 1983, will receive credit for his 20 months already served.

The sentence relates to an October 2012 crash, when he hit and killed Traye-shon Williams and injured his brother Jay'Shard Conner, then 10, as they crossed the street in Pagedale.

After Weeden knocked them down in his GMC Sierra pickup, he drove off, leaving the younger boy to die at the scene. Jay'Shared suffered leg injuries.

Police later found Weeden's truck and tied it to the crime, and he was charged three days later.

He was initially charged with second-degree murder and assault, but prosecutors said there were problems building a case against him because one witness refused to testify and another had edibility problems because of a criminal history, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

Authorities said there was also no evidence that Weeden was drunk at the time, and that wet road could have played a role in the crash.

Loss: Traye-shon Williams, pictured with his mother Felicia, died at the scene after he was hit by the car

But the boys' mother, Felicia Williams, responded on Tuesday: 'Someone is laying in the cemetery dead and they will never get up and come home again. That's enough evidence right there.'

Weeden's record includes at least 11 DWI arrests, including six that resulted in convictions.

In 1983, he ran a red light in St. Louis 
and hit another vehicle, killing Avance Wilson, 23, and Doris Ann Jones,
 20, and injuring two others.

St. Louis police sought charges of manslaughter, assault and careless and imprudent driving against Weeden in the case - but he was only charged with careless and imprudent driving and was freed on $50 bail.

His license was revoked in April 1993 after he refused to take a breath test during a traffic stop and he never got it back, records show.

Missed: His mother said the five-year sentence was not enough seeing as he had been a serial offender

Despite this long rap sheet, he served fewer than two years in prison for his DWIs - an example of how offenders avoid tough penalties after deals made in municipal courts, the Post-Dispatch reported.

Williams, 32, said she believed the sentence was too lenient, especially considering his history.

'It's not just my baby,' she said. 'It's two other bodies.'

She demanded to know why his sentence wasn't harsher.

'Why is he so privileged?' she asked. 'To just receive five years, and you’ve been doing this since the ’80s, is crazy.'
