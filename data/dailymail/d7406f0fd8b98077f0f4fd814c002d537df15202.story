Liverpool are pressing ahead with their stadium redevelopment plans as they look to expand the capacity of their Anfield home.

Steel structures of the new Main Stand are already starting to take shape with work to be completed in time for the 2016/17 season.

The redevelopment of the new Main Stand, which will seat 21,000 spectators, will increase the ground's capacity by 9,000 to 54,000.

Over 4,800 tonnes of steel will be needed for the new Main Stand, which will see the existing structure joined together with the new building.

Liverpool FC’s operations director Andrew Parkinson told the Liverpool Echo: 'Progress is on track since December when we said we would be going ahead with the Main Stand development.

'We’ve been doing a lot of the foundation works and now we’re in the process of erecting the steel and that’s all coming up very quickly.

The new Main Stand will be able to seat 21,000 spectators and will be open in time for the 2016-17 season

'We’re already at the stage where the new steel is as high as the existing Main Stand and that’s within a week since the steel arrived. As we get further and further, from game to game, people are going to see a big transformation in front of their eyes.'

After the Main Stand has been redeveloped, Liverpool will move onto expanding the Anfield Road end and take the capacity of the stadium to just shy of 60,000.
