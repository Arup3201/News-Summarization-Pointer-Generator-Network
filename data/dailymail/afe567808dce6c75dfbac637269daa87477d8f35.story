Jerry Springer had nothing but kind words to say about his former producer Jill Blackstone, who could be rearrested for the murder of her sister.

The Hollywood producer was arrested for murder on Wednesday in Los Angeles but later released without charge over the death of her sister, Wendy, 49, who was found dead in the garage of the home they shared on Saturday, alongside their three dogs. 

'She hasn’t worked on the show for twenty years but I remember her,' Springer told Daily Mail Online exclusively. 'She was just a very nice person. She was one of our producers and a very good one. 

'But I can’t comment on anything else about what’s currently happening with her, he said'

Meanwhile LAPD officer Drake Madison tell Daily Mail Online that this is 'an ongoing murder investigation.'

'Jill Blackstone was arrested on Saturday but the District Attorney dropped the charges and she is no longer in custody. The investigation is still active and the police are looking for a murderer,' he said.

Asked if the police could re-arrest Jill, officer Madison said he had no further information at this time.

 

 

Arrested: Jill Blackstone, a former producer on Jerry Springer, was taken into custody by the LAPD in connection with the death of her sister, Wendy Blackstone. Neighbors say it was a suicide pact gone wrong

Scene: Police were called to the Studio City home of Jill Blackstone on Monday, after she reported finding her sister and three dogs dead in the garage

Stephanie’s husband, Dennis, 68, added: ‘Around 4pm they brought Jill out and she was conscious and she was sitting up, but they didn’t bring anyone else out.

'Then they brought out one of the dogs, wrapped in a sheet.’ 

The Cohens explained how the sisters were under a great deal of pressure, especially Jill, 52, as Wendy was deaf.

To make matters worse the sisters were facing being forced out of their home in the San Fernando Valley area  by developers.

Neighbors exclusively told Daily Mail Online said they heard through the police that Wendy had died by asphyxiation and were led to believe the incident had been an attempted double suicide, possibly by trying to poison themselves with fumes from their car. 

Stephanie Cohen, 60, who lives across the street from the sisters said: ‘The police were here for 12 to 14 hours on Saturday. We were told they were investigating a double suicide, an attempt, and one of the people died.’

On Wednesday numerous signs were posted on the property saying it had been marked for demolition. 

Stephanie added: ‘They were having a hard time finding a new home because the sister that died was very ill - she couldn’t see, she couldn’t hear, she was housebound, she was very ill. So she needed to find a house that could accommodate her sister with the illness and the dogs. Evidently the pressure was intense on them, but nobody expected this to happen.’ 

According to TMZ, Jill was the one to call police, who subsequently arrested her after they concluded a suicide note reportedly left by her sister had actually been written by her.

Jill was initially held on $1 million bail before being released later on Wednesday, and the case was sent to the Los Angeles Police Department for further investigation, according to the website.

Another neighbor, Ron Ross, an 81-year-old actor, said he had been told by a close friend of the Blackstone sisters they had attempted to kill themselves in a suicide pact. 

He added: ‘They kept themselves to themselves, they seemed very nice, I know they had a dog rescue operation. I think they lived here about 10 years.

‘They have good friends on the street who they were text messaging back and forth and the friends became worried when they didn’t respond and I think they called the ambulance.’ 

The police investigation into the death of Wendy is ongoing.

On her Linkedin page she describes herself as: 'Some of you know me as a TV producer, others as an animal welfare advocate and dog rescuer. I'm all those things.’
