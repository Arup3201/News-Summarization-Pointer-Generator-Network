Dead: Anthony Hills, 55, pictured, died on Saturday after being infected with flesh-eating bacteria

A South Carolina man has died just hours after being rushed to hospital with a flesh-eating disease.

Anthony Hills, 55, from Charleston, passed away on Saturday having contracted necrotizing fasciitis - the same disease that savagely struck Georgia student Aimee Copeland and saw all four of her limbs amputated.

Hills' family rushed the man to Medical University of South Carolina with a swollen arm after he complained of not feeling well.

Doctors said the infection started in Hills' right arm and right leg and his condition deteriorated rapidly.

'It's a lightning strike kind of thing you know, where it just doesn't happen that often,' Dr Michael Kilby, chief of infectious disease at the hospital, told Live Five News.

'But when it does, it goes sour really fast and needs medical attention really quickly.'

They amputated the affected arm and were considering removing his left leg before he died, according to the TV station.

It is not known how the man contracted the disease.

Hills is the third American to die from the rare strain of flesh-eating bacteria this year.

Linda Snyder, a pastor from Sacramento, California, lost her life in June after being infected with necrotizing fasciitis.

Michigan woman Crystal Spencer, 33, also died in June after a month-long battle with the vicious disease.

Scores of other victims have had often multiple limbs removed in a bid to contain the infection.

In South Carolina alone, hospital officials at Roper St. Francis confirmed an adult male was admitted to the hospital in mid-June with the bacteria but his status is unknown.

In May, new mother, Lana Kuykendall, 
contracted necrotizing fasciitis in a hospital in upstate South 
Carolina, just after delivering her twin babies.

She underwent 20 surgical procedures to stop the aggressive bacteria spreading but managed to avoid having any limbs amputated.

Earlier this year, doctors at MUSC helped save the life of 59-year-old Hilton Head man, Barry Ginn, who contracted the rare strain of bacteria in his collarbone and left shoulder.

But the Charleston County 
Coroner's Office said this was the first known case of flesh-eating bacteria 
to result in death in Charleston County.

According to the CDC, up to 800 cases of the infection are reported a year, and around 20 per cent of those are fatal.

'The causes of the infection are not that unusual,' Dr Kilby told ABC News.

'You don't have to be in the jungle or exposed to animals or have any unusual exposure.  It's just normal bacteria that are all around that just get into the wrong place.

'One theory is that the same old bacteria develop a new toxin or new characteristic that makes it more invasive,' he said.

At least three Americans have died and another eight victims have had limbs amputated after contracting the rare and extremely vicious disease known as necrotizing fasciitis.

The nasty bacteria, more commonly called 'flesh-eating disease', rapidly causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat.

The bug enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape and as the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area.

Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body.

Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications.

Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg.

Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.
