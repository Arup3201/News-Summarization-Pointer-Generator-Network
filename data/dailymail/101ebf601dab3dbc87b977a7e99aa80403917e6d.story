The Russian owner of Crufts' Best in Show has dismissed the outrage surrounding the way her handler picked up the Scottish terrier as 'pure trolling'.

Marina Khenkina, 48, spoke out after finding herself at the centre of an animal cruelty storm, sparked by the way her American handler Rebecca Cross picked up her Scottish terrier Knopa by its neck and tail at the world-famous dog show.

So far, almost 190,000 people have signed online petitions calling for Ms Cross to be stripped of her prestigious title, while Crufts has also issued an apology.

Anger: American handler Rebecca Cross picked up her Scottish terrier Knopa by the tail - sparking outrage and calls for her to be stripped of the Best in Show title

Legitimate: Marina Khenkina, the Russian owner of Crufts' Best in Show is adamant it can be legitimate to grab terriers by their tails

Ms Cross, who was captured on camera picking Knopa up in the unconventional manner on Sunday, has apologised - but said it was usual to handle the terrier in this way in the States.

'It's just one of those things,' Ms Cross said afterwards. 'It happened and I tried to really think about it and not do it, but it's habit.'

Mrs Khenkina, who was at Crufts watching over her prize-winning canines, has now waded into the scandal - nicknamed 'Tailgate' - backing Knopa's handler.

The Moscow dog breeder is adamant it can be legitimate to grab terriers by their tails.

'I saw those rumours about cruel behaviour of my handler and I would call it pure trolling,' she told MailOnline. 

'Those who say such things have no idea about terriers. Terriers are hunting dogs designed for dragging animals out of holes.

'And the only way the hunter can take the dog out of the hole is to grab its tail.'

Mrs Khenkina also praised the strong bond between Ms Cross and the black Scottish terrier.

'I know Rebecca, the handler, for a long time. She loves Knopa,' she said. 'Hurting her is the last thing in this world she would do. This is just trolling.'

Murdered: Knopa's owner said the shocking poisoning of the highly rated setter at Crufts was 'terrible news'

Marina Khenkinais adamant it can be legitimate to grab terriers by their tails: 'Terriers are hunting dogs designed for dragging animals out of holes. And the only way the hunter can take the dog out of the hole is to grab its tail'

But Tailgate was not the only scandal at this year's Crufts: as many as six of the competing dogs may have been poisoned, while three-year-old Irish Setter Jagger was 'murdered' after eating cubes of beef laced with poison, including slug pellets.

Mrs Khenkina, speaking from Poland, said the shocking poisoning of the highly rated setter at Crufts was 'terrible news'.

'I did not know about it when I was in England, I only read in the news on my way back to Moscow - I am driving from England to Russia now,' she said.

'It's not for me to say who might have done this.'

However, others online joked Knopa may be a Russian spy, and President Vladimir Putin, desperate to win the sought-after title of Best in Show, could be behind the death - noting the Russians apparently have form with poisoning on British soil.

In particular, the tweets cite the death of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned in 2006 after meeting with Russian associates in a top London hotel.

'The winning dog was from Russia, so it wouldn't be a surprise if the poison turned out to be polonium [the radioactive substance used to kill Litvinenko],' Carl Maxim (@carlmaxim) tweeted. 

Paddy Power has even offered odds of 12/1 on Putin being behind the dog's death. 

Trolling: Marina Khenkina, the Russian owner of Crufts' Best in Show, has dismissed the outrage surrounding the way her handler picked up the Scottish terrier as 'pure trolling'

Veteran: Facebook page shows Rebecca Cross, who has a baby daughter, previously served in the military

Nearly 100,000 people have now signed an online petition, calling for Ms Cross to be stripped of her prestigious title

But Mrs Khenkina was contemptuous of any idle jokes - and quick to make clear she had nothing to do with Jagger's death. 

She said: 'If anyone is comparing this to the story with Alexander Litvinenko, this is rubbish. 

'These two things have nothing in common. The dog world is a completely different place and people don't do things from a political motive here.'

Mrs Khenkina said she was watching another ring show the day Jagger was allegedly poisoned, adding she did not care about setters because 'it is not my breed at all'. 

She insisted: 'Our victory was a fair and clear one. We are sure in ourselves and in our victory, although we did not expect it at all. It happened so suddenly.' 

Light-hearted: Some Twitter users have joked Russia, desperate to come out on top at Crufts, may be behind the killing of Jagger

Scandal: Jagger, who is co-owned by Belgian Aleksandra Lauwers and Leicester-based breeder Dee Milligan-Bott, died in his owner's arms on Friday, after returning home to Belgium from the world famous show

Disgrace: Mrs Khenkina said the poisoning was a 'disgrace' - and emphasised the world of canine competitions was completely separate from the political arena. Pictured: A Crufts competitor

In fact, Mrs Khenkina revealed she is always prepared to go and help, should another animals become sick. 

'Real Russian dog owners are special people, they care for their dogs and puppies, they raise them with love,' she explained.

'We prefer to save somebody else's dog. I always carry a full vet kit with me, maybe breaking the laws of other countries, crossing the borders with it but I need to have it with me and I glad to say that I did save dogs in my life and I did not care what country they belonged to.'  

She added: 'I have been breeding and exhibiting dogs for many years and I know that dogs can be poisoned at shows.

'In the turbulent 1990s such a case took place in Russia. There was also an incident in Poland and in other countries, but I have not heard about such cases in England before.

'It is an ugly and nasty thing to do, and it must be so hard for the owners. It is a disgrace for the breeders.' 

Apology: Ms Cross (pictured in the arena) apologised, saying she ‘didn’t do it on purpose, it was just habit'

Celebrations: Mrs Khenkina - whose moment of glory was almost ruined when an animal protester stepped out into the right - is determined to enjoy her victory, and not let anything overshadow it

But Mrs Khenkinka is determined not to let any of this get the way of celebrating her beloved dog's victory. 

'[My friends] are all so happy about out victory - that a Russian dog, bred in America but Russian-owned, won the first prize. And think how politically beautiful it is, both for Russia and for America,' she said.

'And the dog's full name is To Russia With Love, after all.'

It is far from the first victory for the five-year-old Knopa, who was born in America. 

'Knopa has won many titles before Crufts,' Mrs Khenkina said, proudly.

'She was the junior World Champion, Junior European Champion, Interchampion and many other titles, and I was handling her myself two years ago when we got a title at Crufts too.'
