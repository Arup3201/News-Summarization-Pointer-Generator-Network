A woman claiming to be the wife of an Australian Islamic State terrorist has posted a photo of his bloodied dead body on Twitter, announcing that he has been killed while fighting in Syria.

Melbourne man Suhan Rahman's twisted wife said: ‘May Allah accept my husband, Abu Jihad al Australi.’

‘Promised Allah and fought in the front lines until he obtained shahadah,’ she added.

Rahman, who had been fighting under the name Abu Jihad al Australi, previously threatened a terrorist attack on Australia claiming he would 'bring the war home' to the west in January.

‘Spill blood young Aussies,’ he wrote on Twitter. 

His last known location was Raqqa, an Islamic State stronghold in Syria.

The woman, named Zumarul Jannah, who claimed to be his wife said: ‘Alhamdulillahi rabbil alimeen, I'm the most content I have ever been in my life ♡.’

The woman who claimed to be Rahman's wife said: 'I'm the most content I have ever been in my life.'

‘And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of Allah as dead,’ she added.

She also posted a photo of a man that looks like Rahman praying.

The 23-year-old was pictured with Sydney terrorist Mohamed Elomar earlier this year and was also friends with playboy Melbourne jihadi Mahmoud Abdullatif.

Rahman and Abdullatif regularly conversed via Twitter before Abdullatif was reported dead in January.

In November Rahman confessed to Abdullatif it was his ‘first time using twitter its tripping out bruv [sic]’.

Abdullatif replied: ‘Lol I know I still don’t how to use it.’

‘Ye how do I retweet to others and what duz dat mean.’ Rahman asked. ‘I’ll explain when I come home insha Allah,’ Abdullatif responded.

Along with his recent postings on Twitter, Rahman also uploaded one photograph of himself wielding a high-powered silver rifle AK47.

Referencing the terrorist attack on French satirical magazine Charlie Hedbo in January, where two Islamist gunmen killed editor Stéphane Charbonnier and 11 other people, Rahman wrote: 'May allah accept the french brothers who terrorised france. Allahu akbar. Day by day we will bring the war home to you.’ 

His previous posts painted a keen young reveller at Melbourne nightclubs who enjoyed partying with his mates, rap music and fast cars but in recent months, he has taken an eerie turn.

Rahman's family made a desperate plea for him to return home in January after his father Lutfur Rahman alerted authorities that he was fighting with IS, The Daily Telegraph reports.

Abdullatif and Rahman chatted about how they didn't know how to use Twitter back in November 2014 

Australian-born jihadist Mahmoud Abdullatif, who was reported dead in January, was friends with Rahman

Mr Rahman was told by the Australian Federal Police Counter-Terrorism Squad that they were monitoring his son's every movement overseas.

His father has been left distraught after learning his son's decision when he slipped out of the country with three other men to go to Syria.

'We hoped that he would never get into this type of thing,' his father has told the Daily Telegraph.

'Everything was OK then suddenly he just left the country.' 

Rahman's death comes after Abdulllatif's widow shared a series of propaganda pictures she says shows her 'five star jihad' lifestyle - and says she and other female jihadists are 'thirsty' for the blood of her former countrymen.

In photographs posted to a Twitter account believed to belong to former Melbourne woman Zehra Duman, several women are pictured standing under an Islamic State flag, reclining against a clean white BMW M5, wielding machine guns and dressed from head to toe in black Islamic dress.

In one tweet, Duman said: 'US + Australia, how does it feel that all 5 of us were born n raised in your lands, & now here thirsty for ur blood?'

Another image of five women standing under an Islamic State flag is captioned: 'Can't mess with my clique. From the land down under, to the land of Khilafah. Thats the Aussie spirit.'  

A Twitter account understood to belong to Zehra Duman posted a series of photographs of jihadist women 'from Australia and the US' posing with a BMW M5, which they said originated in France

In another image, the women are pictured posing in head-to-toe black dress under an Islamic State flag

Alarming: Zehra Duman posted this photograph to social media with the caption: '5 star jihad. M5 (the BMW) in the land of sham (Syria) he he '

Vile caption: The former Melbourne woman sprayed a series of hateful messages on social media on 

Vanished: Zehra Duman, pictured, left behind a distraught family when she fled for the Middle East late in 2014. She later posted that she had married jihadist fighter Mahmoud Abdullatif, married 

Duman's account follows the similar naming conventions as previous social media accounts. 

It also featured pictures of her late reported partner, Abdullatif, as her 'beautiful husband'.

Daily Mail Australia reported in January that Duman congratulated her late partner for his death after he was reportedly killed. 

'You won the race!' she tweeted, describing him as a 'green bird' - the term used to describe a so-called martyr.

The identities of the jihadist women in Ms Duman's pictures are unclear. 

However, the BMW bears resemblance to the same vehicle Australian jihadist and former underworld figure Mohammed Elomar was pictured smirking and wielding a Glock next to in September 2014.

Defensive: Zehra Duman justified boasting about her 'five star jihad' lifestyle - but was then forced to defend the posts, telling her followers to 'chill n stop jujjing'

Shortly after boasting about the expensive vehicle, Duman became defensive on social media and said 'no one is trying to be flashy'

'The m5 was driven here from france (sic) and is meant to be sold here. Chill n stop (judging). No one is trying to be flashy in sham (Syria).'  

Duman fled Australia late last year, leaving behind a distraught family, who told reporters she had been 'brainwashed'. 

The tweets, pictured here, have since been deleted

The Herald Sun quoted her father, Duvat Duman, saying: 'She’s been brainwashed, she wasn’t like this three or four months ago.' 

Khaled Sharrouf's wife Tara Nettleton is among the Australian females who have joined the Islamic State.

Australian teenager Jake Bilardi was reported dead in a suicide bombing in Ramadi, Iraq, last week.
