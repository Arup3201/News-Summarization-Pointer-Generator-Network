As the search for missing flight MH370 exceeds the nine month mark, those hunting for debris of the plane have revealed new footage of what they've found on the ocean floor. 

The picture, released by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau on Thursday, shows what search vessels are recording as they continue to scour the Indian Ocean for any signs of the Malaysian Airlines plane.

'The image is a synthetic aperture sonar acoustic image of the sea floor gathered by GO Phoenix. This is indicative of the resolution and quality of the data and that it is revealing important detail of the sea floor,' the ATSB, who is leading the search, said in its latest operational report.

The GO Phoenix vessel returned to the area on Tuesday to recommence underwater search operations. Another vessel, Fugro Discovery, is also searching underwater as the Fugro Equator continues to conduct bathymetric survey operations in the search area.

'In addition to locating the aircraft, the underwater search aims to map the MH370 debris field in order to identify and prioritise the recovery of specific aircraft components, including flight recorders, which will assist with the Malaysian investigation,' the ATSB said.

'The ATSB has utilised the data from the bathymetric survey work to prepare the initial plan for the underwater search, to be followed and referred to by all parties involved. 

More than 9,000 square kilometres of the Indian Ocean floor has been searched to date, but there's been no signs of the missing Malaysian Airlines flight

'The plan includes search timings, methods, procedures, safety precautions and the initial search areas for the various vessels.

'The equipment used on the vessels is providing extraordinary data.'

More than 9,000 square kilometres of the ocean floor has been searched to date and about 200,000 square kilometres of the search area has been surveyed, according to the ATSB. 

The primary search area - dubbed the ‘priority area' - is an arc 60,000 square kilometres in size - 1,800km off the west Australian coast.
