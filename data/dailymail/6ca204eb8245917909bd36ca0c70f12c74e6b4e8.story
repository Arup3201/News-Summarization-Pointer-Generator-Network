The New York Knicks will take on the Milwaukee Bucks at London's O2 Arena in January as the NBA returns to the UK.

The Knicks played the Detroit Pistons at The O2 at the beginning of 2013 and they will be back in London to take on Milwaukee on January 15.

That game is one of two regular-season contests to be played under the NBA Global Games banner next season, with the other one seeing the Houston Rockets and Minnesota Timberwolves square off in Mexico City.

Return: The New York Knicks will be back in London when they take on the Milwaukee Bucks

NBA commissioner Adam Silver said: 'While London and Mexico City each have their own unique culture, they both have rich sports traditions and share a great passion for the NBA. These regular-season games will bring the excitement and incredible competition of our league to more fans in Europe and Latin America.'

'We are very happy to be hosting an NBA regular-season game at The O2 for the fifth time,' said Matthieu Van Veen, senior vice president of AEG Sports Europe.

'The appetite for the premier annual NBA event in Europe is proven and we are excited to bring London basketball fans another world class event, as we welcome back the New York Knicks and hosts the Milwaukee Bucks.'
