The £4billion battle for live TV coverage of the Premier League is set to be a three-way contest.

The current dominance of Sky and BT Sport is likely to be challenged by Discovery Communications, the American documentary channel, when bidding for the 2016-19 seasons closes Friday.

The fierce competition for the seven packages of matches up for grabs, which total of 168 live games a season, could see the price of a single live game rise to an amazing £8m.

Such a bonanza would bring in more than £4bn over three years from the domestic TV market alone with another healthy increase on the current £2bn from overseas deals to come later. This is as well as the £204m already agreed with the BBC for Match of the Day highlights.

The biggest winners from this windfall will, as ever, be the Premier League players with £200,000-a-week contracts for the elite stars likely to become more commonplace.

Sky are expected to pour all their resources into retaining at least four of their prime first pick packages while BT will want an increase on their 38 live games per season. And Discovery Comunications, who own Eurosport, are also keen on a slice of the live PL action.

And there’s still speculation in a tender, in which all those involved have had to sign strict confidentiality agreements, over whether Qatar-based beIN Sport, the richest TV network in the world, will make a bid.

Meanwhile, broadcast regulators Ofcom have, as expected, turned down Virgin Media’s fanciful appeal to postpone the rights auction until their complaint about the sales process is fully investigated.
