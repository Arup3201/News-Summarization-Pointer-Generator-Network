An alleged carjacker came off second best when he threatened to harm Dorothy Baker's young children.

Not only did she manage to wrestle a knife from him but ran him over with her minivan as he attempted to flee.

'He messed with the wrong witch,' said Dorothy Baker, from Baytown, Texas.

Don't mess with Texas: Mother-of-six Dorothy Baker was terrified for her children when she managed to fight of a would-be carjacker

The terrifying ordeal began after Baker drove home from a local CVS after shopping with her sons, five-year-old Xavier and Jayden, two.

A man who had been hiding at the back of the minivan crept up on her and brandished a knife demanding money.

'I asked him how much he needed and he said $200,' Baker said. 'And I told him I didnâ€™t have that kind of cash, I had about $20 in my account, and he said I better figure out a way to get it, or my kids were going to get hurt.'

As she drove along the alleged attacker Ismael Martinez, 53, climbed into the front passenger seat.

He noticed Baker had dialed 911 on her cell phone and the pair began to struggle.

Baker said she was able to wrestle the knife Martinez's hand, but was slashed across the chest. She punched him in the face and ordered him out of her car.

The armed robber jumped from the minivan empty-handed and ran off.

Baker said she suddenly realized that if he got away he might strike again.

'He kind of zagged and I turned, intending to clip him in the side or something to get him to stop,' she said. 'And I ended up running completely over him.'

Ismael Martinez was taken to Memorial Hermann hospital via Life Flight, where he was listed in stable condition.

Records reveal Martinez was jailed for a 1976 rape conviction.

Police and locals have praised mother-of-six Dorothy for her actions.

'She got into a struggle with the man while trying to protect her children,' said Lieutenant Eric Freed with the Baytown police.

Unexpected: Baker was shopping in her local neighborhood when the attack happened

'She actually overpowered him. At some point in time, he jumped from the vehicle and was run over by the vehicle.'

Baker says she only wanted to stop Martinez, and never intended to seriously harm him.

At the CVS where Baker had been shopping before being carjacked others praised her for protecting her children.

'That's scary, it's really scary,' said Baytown resident Dottie Sparks. 'But good for her!'

Another Baytown local Joyce Sparks added, 'She's trying to protect herself and her kids. I'd do the same thing.'

Husband: Baker's husband Charles Flugence said he's very proud of his wife for her bravery

Martinez was airlifted to Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston with serious injuries after the alleged attack. He is expected to face felony charges once he is discharged.

The children were unhurt in the incident, and their father is thankful for his wife's actions.

'She's my hero. I'll take her anywhere. I'll take her anywhere twice on Sunday,' said Charles Flugence.

'She's a tough one. I wouldn't have it any other way.'
