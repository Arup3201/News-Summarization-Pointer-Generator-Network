Shimmering in the golden sun of a frozen dusk, the prismatic skin of this soap bubble globe turns pellucid as ice crystals feathers upwards from its southern hemisphere.

Hope Thurston Carter captured the images after blowing soap bubbles on several freezing days in Michigan.

'No two photos of these bubbles are alike and all are just a moment captured in time and then poof - they are gone,' she said.

'Some look like someone used gold leaf paint inside them! Nature's colours are amazing.'

Nature's colours: Golden sunlight makes this frozen soap bubble look like a priceless artefact 

Shapes: The incredible patterns in the bubbles form as ice crystals spread across their surfaces

Reflections: This remarkable ice bubble looks like a frozen planet hanging in starless space

Inner glow: A mysterious-looking red light shines from within this bubble of frozen soapy water

Golden: The play of the light through the frozen bubbles is one of the most interesting aspects of the shots

In the midst of one of the most severe winters in modern American history, the 52-year-old, of Martin, Michigan, got the idea after seeing similar pictures on the Internet.

'I was instantly curious and ran out and bought some bubble solution so I could try this myself,' she told HotSpot Media.

'I found out very quickly that blowing bubbles in the winter and trying to photograph them is not as simple and easy as it looks!'

Still weather with temperatures between -9 and -12 degrees Celsius is ideal for creating the ice bubbles.

On such a day, Mrs Thurston Carter ventures into her back garden with a bottle of bubble mixture, blows a flurry and, when one lands intact, runs to her camera to photograph it as crystals spread.

Weather conditions: Still weather with temperatures between -9C and -12C is ideal for creating the bubbles

How: Mrs Thurston Carter blows bubbles and, when one lands intact, runs to her camera to photograph it

Patience: That's the key virtue needed when doing this kind of a project, Mrs Thurston Carter says 

Beautiful: 'I am so thankful and appreciative of the fact that I have been able to do this,' she said

She puts the success of her unpredictable images down to patience.

'You never know what you're going to get, but it all comes with a price and that is patience,' she said.

'What I love about this project is the anticipation of trying to capture a unique form, and the element of surprise I experience each time I photograph these bubbles never ceases to amaze me.

'It's all really interesting to me and some of the comments I've received recently I have never thought about.

'I had a dear friend the other day thank me for capturing nature's beauty in a way that most people would never even imagine or see.

'That just made me feel wonderful because I just love to share what I've done, especially if it is something others cannot do or have the ability "to see".

'I am so thankful and appreciative of the fact that I have been able to do this.'
