Attics and garages all over Britain are likely to be filled with dust covered boxes of them.

But museum curators have made an appeal for members of the public to contribute their old Airfix models and kits after an exhibition due to open at the Royal Air Force museum has been left with gaps.

The exhibition, which is due to open in June, will document the history of Airfix dating back to its advent in 1939.

Kits still in their boxes are also being sought to be included in the Royal Airforce Museum exhibition, which opens in June

But the museum has a shortage of certain types of Airfix toys from the 1950s and 1960s which it is hoped members of the public can fill by donating their models, either fully built or still in boxes.

The missing items in particular include the first Spitfire, the first Massey Ferguson Tractor, the HMS Endeavour and a Hawker P1127.

Also sought after are figures from the historical characters range, including Joan of Arc, Henry VIII, Oliver Cromwell and Charles I.

The company was launched in 1939 by Hungarian Nicholas Kove.

The small-scale Golden Hind model first went on sale in Woolworths in 1952.

The first Spitfire - one of the company's most popular models - went on sale in 1953.

During the 1970s Airfix was selling 20 million kits a year.

In the 1980s the toys began to decline and the firm was bought by General Mills, who later sold it to Borden.

In 1995 Airfix was sold to Allen McGuire and in 2006 it was bought by trainset toy company, Hornby.

Curators are mainly looking for perfectly built items in mint condition, but are also seeking one or two more clumsy attempts to feature in the collection.

Andrew Cormack, the curator of the exhibition, told the Sunday Times: 'It would be interesting to get a few examples of models made by eight-year-olds who were shockingly proud of them, but which were actually dreadful.

'We would like to make a feature of some for the huge enjoyment people got from making their own toy. Anything and everything is of interest.'

The company is assisting in the search, but as the ownership has changed many times over the years there are gaps in some of the ranges needed for the exhibition.

Appeals have been made in vain to model clubs but the curators are hoping members of the public will be able to fill the void.
