A rural Maine community is in mourning now that a resident teen beauty queen who sustained horrific injuries in an October car crash has died after weeks in critical condition.

19-year-old Fort Fairfield, Maine woman Abby Ladner was in a head-on collision October 27 and her tight-knit group of family and friends had been praying for a miracle ever since as she lay in a hospital bed at the brink of death.

Despite all their hope and outpourings of emotional and financial support, that miracle would never come.

Tragic: Abby Ladner, a 19-year-old beauty queen from the small community of Fort Fairfield, Maine, died from injures she endured in a late October head-on collision

Horrific: Ladner was struck head-on when 67-year-old Barry Belyea crossed into her lane. Both drivers were pinned into what had been their cars but had become a single mangled mass of steel

Abby, a beautiful brunette student at the University of Maine, held the title of Miss Northern Maine at the time of her death.

Her fight to stay alive began after the October crash, when 67-year-old Barry Belyea of Portland Maine was driving his ford pickup and veered slightly into a lane of oncoming traffic.

Abby had the misfortune of being in that lane, driving straight toward Belyea. Her Honda smashed headlong into the truck, crushing Abby’s car.

Police photos from the scene show a mangled mass of steel where there had once been two vehicles. Somehow, Belyea walked away with minor injures.

While the driver of the other car walked away with minor injuries, Abby's were severe. In addition to broken bones, she suffered serious brain trauma. After the October 27, she would spend the last three weeks of her life in critical condition at the brink of death

Praying: Abby's family--including her father Troy and mother Saré Giberson--spent the three weeks leading up to their daughter's death hoping a miracle would happen

Abby wasn’t nearly as lucky.

Despite wearing her seat belt, she was left with several broken bones and a serious head injury and flown by plane to Eastern Maine Medical Center, according to the Bangor Daily News.

She died there on Sunday, November 16 around 3:30pm after three weeks in critical condition.

As her family waited in anguish over the course of those weeks to see if their daughter would somehow pull through, the community responded in kind with donations to help her father Troy Ladner and mother Saré Giberson cover mounting medical costs.

While her small Maine community prayed for Abby, who was the reining Miss Northern Maine, they rallied around her family and raised thousands to offset her medical costs

Too late: A local radio station organized a dinner benefit for Abby and her family in the days before her death, to be held December 4

An online fundraiser started in Abby’s name had earned accrued $1,767 by the time Abby succumbed to her injuries, nearly $300 more than its goal.

The kindly proprietors of a local radio station must now be reeling as well. Tiny Presque Isle’s Q96.1 station organized a benefit in the days before Abby’s death.

They planned to hold a charity dinner for Abby and her family on December 4.

Final goodbye: Despite Abby's death on November 16, the supper benefit in her name will go on. Organizers hope to turn it into a memorial service where a devastate community can give a fitting farewell to their beloved beauty queen

Though Abby has now passed on, organizer Brooke Beaulieu says the dinner will still be held and hopes it will serve as time for the grieving small community to give a final goodbye to their tragically killed beauty queen.

‘It is still on, with the okay of the family,’ Beaulieu wrote on the Supper benefit’s Facebook page. ‘It’s a great opportunity to show support and love for Abby’s family during this difficult time as well as celebrate Abby's precious life.’

Though the cause of the tragic crash remains under investigation, police do not believe speeding or alcohol were factors.
