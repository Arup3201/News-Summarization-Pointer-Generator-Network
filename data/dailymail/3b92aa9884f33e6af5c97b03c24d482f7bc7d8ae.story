Pope Francis will offer plenary indulgences to participants of World Youth Day - even it is only over the internet

The Pope will offer forgiveness to Catholics who follow services on World Youth Day - even if it is only through Twitter.

The Vatican announced Pope Francis will offer plenary indulgences to participants in the festival - his first foreign trip as Pontiff - in Rio de Janeiro this month.

Pilgrims travelling to the Brazilian city will be granted indulgences, but in an unusual step, the Argentine Pope has extended the offer to people who participate in the event by watching it on television, listening over the radio or following it on the internet.

Plenary indulgences offer a full pardon of the temporal punishment (a punishment due to be suffered either in this life or the next) for sins that have already been forgiven in confession.

The church teaches indulgences can reduce time spent in purgatory.

Cardinal Manuel Monteiro de Castro, head of the 
Vatican office that deals with indulgences, released a decree saying Catholics across the world can receive a partial indulgence if they pray with the Pope for young Catholics.

About 2million pilgrims, including hundreds of thousands of young Catholics, are expected to flock to Rio for the event.

To receive indulgences from abroad, Catholics must participate in the service 'under the usual spiritual, sacramental and prayer conditions, in a spirit of filial submission to the Roman Pontiff'.

They must  participate 'in the sacred functions on
the days indicated, following the same rites and spiritual exercises as
they occur via television or radio or, with due devotion, via the new 
means of social communication,' Catholic News Agency reported.

Speaking to Vatican Radio, Monsignor John Kennedy, an official at the Congregation of the 
Faith said: 'The word indulgence is not very 
familiar to many people today, especially to the younger generation.

'In fact, you might be surprised to know that the Christian 
meaning of the word indulgence really comes from Latin "indulgentia" and
it means kindness or tenderness, and refers, in this context to God’s 
kindness in forgiving the effects of sins.

'[Indulgences] are linked to a theme that Pope Francis has 
spoken very frequently about since the moment of his election – that is 
to say, to the gift of God’s mercy.

The huge festival will be held from July 23 to 28.

Pope Francis will greet tens of thousands of pilgrims on Copacabana beach on July 25 and during the five days he will be guarded by 600 military personnel.

He will also hear the confessions of some of the young Catholics at Rio's Quinta da Boa Vista Park.

Following the recent protests in Brazil and political unrest, 8,500 soldiers have been deployed to marshal the festival.
