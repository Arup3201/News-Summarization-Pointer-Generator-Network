Sam Rimmer, 19, sexually assaulted an 84-year-old woman at knife point and was jailed for 12 years

A teenager who sexually assaulted an 84-year-old woman at knifepoint in a brutal attack which left her with 44 separate injuries has been jailed for 12 years.

Sam Rimmer, 19, climbed in through the window of the frail victim's home before launching the 'vicious' sex attack.

The drunken intruder was armed with a large bread knife when he broke into her house in Greater Manchester on November 8 last year.

The terrified woman became aware of a 'shadow in her room' moments before he sexually assaulted and tried to rape her, Manchester Crown Court was told.

She fought back and grabbed the knife from the thug, dropping the weapon by the side of the bed. 

Rimmer, from Irlam, Greater Manchester, responded by punching the arthritis sufferer on the shoulder and forcing his fist into her mouth to silence her screams as he continued his horrifying attack.

But as she prayed out loud he 'suddenly came to his senses', apologised and fled before confessing to a friend. 

Prosecutor Phil Dobson told the court how the woman's mobility was badly affected by the attack. Because she now struggles to move her right arm, the pensioner has become reliant on her family and struggles to pay for carers to help with cooking, dressing and bathing.

Despite sleepless nights, she has shown a 'spirited determination and forgiving attitude' in the wake of her terrible ordeal, Mr Dobson said. 

In a witness impact statement, the elderly woman said she had forgiven Rimmer for the shocking attack.

'I feel comfortable in the home I have had for 55 years and I will not let anyone force me out of my own home,' she said.

'Unfortunately I don't think I will ever be able to forget this incident, due to the physical problems I have and the upset it has caused not only me, but my family.

'I really struggle to understand why he has done this to me, however I have no ill feelings towards him and forgive him for what he has done.

'I'm a strong Catholic and feel sorry for him and his family. I hope he will turn his life around.'

Hunter Gray, defending, argued that with no previous convictions, Rimmer should not be classed as a 'dangerous' offender.

But judge Hilary Manley disagreed, saying that Rimmer attacked the victim with 'extreme force and viciousness'.

She added: 'She tried to resist and fight you. You were a young man of 19, making yourself as fit as possible for entry into the Army. She was an 84-year-old who had to use sticks when she walked.

'She is clearly resilient and brave but these offences have had a profound impact on her life... she's not spent a night at home alone since this incident. This was a vicious and humiliating attack on a vulnerable and defenceless elderly woman, it must have been a terrifying experience for her.

'Had she not managed to disarm you it could have ended even more badly.'

'You cannot present a reason why you committed this offence - the lengthy and unnecessary violence causes the gravest concern.'

Rimmer admitted attempted rape and sexual assault and was jailed for 12 years.

He must spend an extra five years on licence and will not be released until the authorities are satisfied he is no longer dangerous.
