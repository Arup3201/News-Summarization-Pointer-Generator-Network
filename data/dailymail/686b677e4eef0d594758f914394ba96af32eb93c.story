Suspicious: Shane Todd was found dead in his Singapore apartment last summer. He apparently hanged himself, but his family claims he was murdered

The family of an American who died in Singapore believes he was killed by Chinese spies and is calling for a congressional investigation into his death.

The body of Shane Todd, a 31-year-old electronics engineer, was found hanging from his bathroom wall just two days after his final day of work in June 2012. He was set to return to the U.S. the following week after quitting his job of 18 months at the Institute of Microelectronics.

His death was reported a suicide and police in Singapore reported finding two suicide notes on his computer.

But Todd's mother, Mary Todd, said she immediately doubted the authenticity of the notes.

'My son did not write this note,' she told Fox News. 'He did not take his own life.'

Todd says her son had expressed concerns that his employers in Singapore were using him to help China access sensitive military technology to harm U.S. national security.

'He told us that his life was being threatened,' she said. 'As the weeks went on he got increasingly more agitated and distressed and would say things to me like, "Mom I'm afraid I'm never going to see you again."'

Rick Todd, the man's father, said they are pursuing a congressional investigation into their son's death. He and his wife are meeting with Sen. Max Baucus of Montana in Washington on Friday to make their case, he told USA Today.

The couple traveled from Montana to Singapore days after his death on June 23, 2012 to investigate where he had spent his last hours, Financial Times reported.

At his apartment, they discovered several things awry, they said.

Piles of laundry were neatly folded and ready to be packed in suitcases, packed moving boxes littered the apartment, and his plane ticket back to the States was sitting on his dining room table.

Tragedy: Todd was found hanging from his bathroom wall just two days after his final day of work in June 2012

The Singapore police report from last summer states that Mr Todd – who stood more than 6 feet tall and weighed 200 pounds – constructed a noose by bolting a pulley to the bathroom wall and wrapping a strap through the contraption.

However, when the Todd family arrived days later, they were appalled to find that their late son’s front door was unlocked, there was no crime tape indicating an active investigation, and more importantly – no bolts drilled into the bathroom wall.

The Singapore Police released a statement in response to the FT article, reading in part: ‘The police investigate all unnatural death cases thoroughly, working closely with the pathologist and other relevant experts, and no prior assumptions are made on the cause of death,’ according to Yahoo! Singapore.

The FT article also states that the FBI bureau in Singapore has volunteered their forensic help on two separate occasions, but said that the local police had declined their help.

An FBI source in Washington told the paper that they could do nothing to help the investigation until the Singapore Police formally accepted their assistance.

In the statement, Singapore police added: ‘Since the death of Mr Shane Todd, the Police have engaged and assisted the family without impending the objectivity of our investigation process. We will continue to do so. Police have also kept the American Embassy and FBI informed of this case.’

The family also recovered a hard drive with backup data from his time at IME. The FT gave information on the hard drive to Colin Humphreys, the director of research at Cambridge University’s Centre for Gallium Nitride.

Humphreys said the data on Dr Todd’s hard drive related to a high-electron mobility transistor made from Gallium Nitride, or GaN. He said said the the project had applications for both the military and commercial use.

The chemical is used in many of today’s 
high-tech products, from Blu-ray players to hybrid electric cars, and 
can withstand heat to much higher capacity than silicone.

Final months: Colleagues said that Todd was depressed in the months preceding his death

The analyses of the hard drive also revealed that someone had tried to access information on it two days after Todd was reported dead.

One of the companies in discussions with IME about the GaN technology was Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, which has been deemed a security risk by the House Intelligence Committee on the grounds that its equipment could be used for spying.

Huawei has routinely denied such accusations and has said it is not linked to the Chinese government.

In a statement to CBS, the Institute of Micro Electronics or IME said, 'neither IME nor Shane was involved in any classified research project. The Institute did not go beyond preliminary talks with Huawei.'

IME is part of a network of research 
institutes managed by government-run Agency for Science, Technology and 
Research, or A*Star. A 
former A*Star researcher now working in the United States pointed out 
that IME and other A*Star institutes were not military research 
organizations.

Huawei said that the development of GaN technology was commonplace across the telecommunications industry.

'IME
 approached Huawei on one occasion to cooperate with them in the GaN 
field, but we decided not to accept, and consequently do not have any 
cooperation with IME related to GaN,' Huawei said in a statement.

Chemicals: Dr Todd was working with Gallium Nitrate (GaN), a synthetic material used in many high-tech objects like Blu-ray players and hybrid electric cars

Huawei declined to say whether they 
had been working on other projects with IME. Colleagues said shortly 
after Todd's death that he had told them at one point he had been 
working on a project with Huawei but that it was not sensitive or 
high-level in nature.

One described it as carrying out 'measurement test reports' of semiconductors.

Interviews with the family, 
colleagues and friends revealed conflicting views on Dr Todd's state of 
mind before his death, the nature of his work and how he died.

Colleagues
 said that he was increasingly depressed in his last few months, but 
said that his concerns appeared to center on a sense of failure about 
his work, and an ambivalence about returning to the United States.

Mrs Todd said in a telephone interview with Reuters last July that her son  had been scared.

'I
 had been talking to him for months for at least an hour every week and 
he told us he was afraid of being murdered because of his contacts with 
the Chinese government,' she said.

'He quit his job because of it.'

Dr Todd's parents said in interviews in July that Singapore police and IME had failed to properly investigate his death after his body was found hanging from a door in his Singapore apartment on the evening of June 24, two days after he quit IME.

Singapore police say they have handled the case as they have handled other cases, and their procedures follow high international standards. They said in such cases of unnatural death, 'no prior assumptions' were made about the cause.
