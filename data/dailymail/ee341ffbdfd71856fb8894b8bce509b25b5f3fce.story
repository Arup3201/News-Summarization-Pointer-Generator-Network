Complaints against Halifax and Bank of Scotland - part of Lloyds – have soared by almost half to 265,640, the City watchdog revealed yesterday.

While other major lenders experienced a drop in disputes from disgruntled customers, complaints against HBOS rose 46pc in the first half of the year, compared to the second half of last year.

This was mainly driven by a surge in complaints about payment protection insurance.

Complaints against Halifax and Bank of Scotland - part of Lloyds – have soared by almost half to 265,640

It total, customers lodged 2.4 million complaints - 18,750 every working day - against financial companies in the first half of the year, a drop of 5pc.

PPI disputes dropped 11pc to 1.24million.

But customers made 202,617 PPI complaints against HBOS – up by more than half from 131,887 in the second half of last year.

HBOS is part of Lloyds Bank, whose complaints have also risen

Complaints against Lloyds Bank also rose from 214,395 to 215,871.

Last night one consumer campaigner demanded the dramatic jump in PPI complaints against HBOS as ‘depressing’.

It comes more than three years after the banks lost a crucial High Court case in April 2011 and were forced to compensate customers after years of insisting they had done nothing wrong.

Lloyds Banking Group, which has set aside £10.4billion for the scandal so far, said it had proactively contacted customers about PPI – prompting a wave of complaints in the first half of this year.

Lobby group the British Bankers’ Association described the drop in overall complaints as ‘encouraging.’

But James Daley, founder of consumer website Fairer Finance said: ‘Banks needs to pay compensation as quickly as possible and pay the right amount to rebuild trust and finally put this scandal to bed.

These figures are very depressing.’

Martin Dodd group customer service director at Lloyds said: ‘We know that there is still work to do, and that some wider industry issues have impacted our customers in the first six months of the year. However, we continue to work to make sure that our customers are getting the right outcomes.’

If you're fed up with your bank there are plenty of reasons why now is a good time to switch to another provider.
