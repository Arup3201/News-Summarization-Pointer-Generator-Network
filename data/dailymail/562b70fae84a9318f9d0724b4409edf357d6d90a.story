With its fearsome beak and three foot wingspan, the Harris Hawk is among the most deadly hunters in the sky.

But that didn't stop a Great Kiskadee from taking on this predator when it strayed too close to the tiny bird's young.

A photographer captured the plucky bird dive-bombing the hawk and landing on its back to ward off any threat to its nest in El Salvador.

The hawk, named Chucky, came under attack from the diminutive adversary as it was part way through a training flight with its handler on the outskirts of San Salvador.

The hawk's handler Roy Beers regularly trains the bird for falconry at the spot.

Photographer Gerardo Grassl, who captured the scenes, said: 'The Great Kiskadee would have been happy 
because it achieved its objective of protecting its young.

'A lot of 
birds in the area were alarmed by the presence of the hawk but the 
Kiskadee was the only one that swooped in to attack, even though it 
could have been killed at any moment.'

The little bird survived the audacious
attack, as the hawk simply continued with its flight and crash landed 
on the decoy laid out by its handler.
