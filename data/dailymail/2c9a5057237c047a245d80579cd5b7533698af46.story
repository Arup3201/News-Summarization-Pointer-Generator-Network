The mother of a gunman who fatally shot five people during a chaotic spate of violence last week said the shooter's father threatened to kill her on at least two occasions during their tumultuous marriage, according to court records obtained Monday by The Associated Press.

In a 1998 request for a restraining order, gunman John Zawahri's mother, Randa Abdou, wrote that her husband once told her: 'If I had a gun it would be over.'

Abdou also said her husband had threatened to take their two young sons to Canada after the couple separated at the time, and that he once punched her and stole her jewelry, purse and divorce papers she had started filling out.

Authorities said John Zawahri, 23, shot his father, Samir Zawahri, and his brother, Christopher Zawahri, on Friday, leaving their home in flames before shooting at strangers in cars and at Santa Monica College during a 15-minute rampage.

The former student at the school was 
heavily armed and carried a duffel bag with 1,300 rounds of ammunition 
before officers killed him in the campus library.

Abdou cut short a visit with family 
in Lebanon to return to Los Angeles on Sunday and had spoken with 
investigators, who hoped she could provide clues to what sparked the 
violence.

Neighbor Beverly Meadows said Abdou told her by phone Monday that she was in mourning and concerned about those who were hurt.

'She is very, very fragile right now, and at this point in time, everybody else is gone,' Meadows said.

Abdou has not spoken to the media.

'Please respect the fact that this 
woman is devastated,' Meadows said. 'She is absolutely overwhelmed and 
she doesn't know how to process it. She sounds like she's done nothing 
but cry. ... She still feels like maybe she should have done something.'

Identified: Carlos Navarro Franco, 68, left, was one of 4 victims of the Santa Monica College shooting spree Friday. Franco's daughter Marcela, 25, remains on life support

Investigators are trying to determine
whether the family's problems played any role in the killings, which 
came as Santa Monica College students were taking final exams. 
Authorities were tracing the firearms to determine the owner and how 
Zawahri was in possession of so much ammunition.

Besides the two Zawahris, the victims
included Carlos Navarro Franco, 68, and his daughter Marcela Franco, 
26. They were gunned down as he pulled his vehicle out of a parking lot 
at the college, where he worked as a landscaper and she was a student.

On Monday, campus Police Chief Albert
Vasquez identified the fifth victim as Margarita Gomez, 68, of Santa 
Monica. She was a nonstudent known for collecting recyclables at the 
site and was shot outside the library.

Neighbors have described Zawahri as 
reclusive and said his 55-year-old father was friendly though not overly
social. It's unclear how long the pair lived together. His 25-year-old 
brother lived with his mother.

Zawahri's parents married in 1985, 
and in the mid-1990s his father brought his family to the Santa Monica 
neighborhood of small homes and apartment buildings tucked up against 
Interstate 10, according to property records.

When Zawahri was 9, his now-separated mother sought the restraining order.

In the 1998 document, Abdou said she 
left Lebanon and joined her husband in the U.S. five years after their 
wedding, and the couple 'have had marital troubles ever since.'

Her husband had been 'verbally 
abusive and controlling,' she stated, adding that she was afraid he 
might do something 'drastic because he seems to become increasingly 
angry and frustrated over our separation.'

Abdou said her husband has 'followed 
me, struck me, taken the children without telling me, and entered my 
apartment without my permission and removed photographs.'

He once came to the apartment and told her that he was going to take the children to Canada, she said.

'The defendant said that he would do 
anything to make my life miserable and that he could kill me and no 
restraining order can stop him,' she said.

Her husband waited for her at work 
once, and when she pulled up in a car with a friend, he struck her in 
the arm, pulled her hair, took gold bracelets, her purse and divorce 
papers she had not completed, she said.

Firepower: The shooter had multiple weapons on him, including an assault rifle, a hand gun and ammunition magazines

She was afraid to press charges, she 
added, because he scared her and she didn't want to enrage him further. 
'The defendant has told me that life means nothing to him if we are not 
together,' she said.

Abdou asked the court to order the 
return of her property, including her green card, and to grant her 
custody of the couple's two sons pending a court hearing. Her request 
for a restraining order requiring Samir Zawahri to stay 100 yards from 
his wife and the kids was granted for a couple weeks. But it expired 
when she failed to appear for a full hearing on the matter.

She wrote that she had filed the 
petition for the restraining order without notifying him because she was
afraid, saying, 'I do not know how he would react to the notice.'

Court records indicated that Samir Zawahri filed for divorce in 1993, but it was never finalized.

Five years later, when Abdou filed 
court papers for the restraining order, she noted that no divorce was 
pending, but she indicated that she had been in the process of filling 
out divorce papers. It's unclear if the couple ever divorced.

Public records show that Abdou sold 
her portion of the family home to Samir Zawahri in 2002. The sale was 
finalized the following year.
