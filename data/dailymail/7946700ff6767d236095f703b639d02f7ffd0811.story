Jennie Bone (right), the wife of Tory MP for Wellingborough Peter Bone, claims bullying police have caused the cancer she suffered 10 years ago to return after finding a lump in her breast

The wife of a senior Tory MP accused of a £100,000 fraud over a subsidised care home for her mother has spoken of her fears of going to jail – and vowed to clear their name.

In a highly emotional interview with The Mail on Sunday, Jennie Bone claimed the stress of the case had caused a recurrence of the cancer that nearly took her life ten years ago.

Mrs Bone and her husband Peter, the Conservative MP for Wellingborough, vehemently deny that they sold the house of Mrs Bone’s mother to clear their own debts and avoid paying the full £26,000-a-year cost of her local authority nursing home.

The couple, under investigation by police for nearly a year, said they would fight to prove their innocence. But they are well aware that, if charged and found guilty, they face personal and political ruin.

‘It’s an absolute nightmare. It’s killing us both,’ revealed Mrs Bone.

She also said her 81-year-old mother would not be able to cope if they were jailed and she felt ‘violated’ by a police search of their home, which was ‘like a scene from A Touch of Frost’.

She claimed police tried to ‘bully’ them into acquiescing to the council’s demand that they pay back the costs for her mother’s care.

Mr Bone claimed he was targeted by police after defending former Cabinet Minister Andrew Mitchell over the ‘Plebgate’ affair.

The MP, who has demanded ‘zero tolerance’ of crime, said: ‘If it was true, I’m a complete crook and should be locked up and the keys thrown away. But it’s not true.’

He also claimed political enemies had conspired with police to smear him.

Until last week, Mr Bone, 61, was known at Westminster chiefly for his jocular habit of referring to his wife during questions to David Cameron. It prompted the Prime Minister to quip: ‘A very big part of my life is trying to give pleasure to Mrs Bone.’

But the couple were in a mirthless mood when they spoke to The Mail on Sunday on Thursday. The police are investigating the sale of the £130,000 Essex home of Mrs Bone’s mother, Dorothy Sweeney, seven years ago, before she moved into care.

The couple are accused of a £100,000 fraud. They deny they sold Mrs Bone's mother's house to clear their own debts and avoid paying the full £26,000-a-year costs for Highmead House Residential Care Home

The Bones admit a large chunk of the money from the sale was used to pay off their debts, which they say built up when Mr Bone took time off to look after their son, Thomas, 13, when Mrs Bone had cancer.

They say Mrs Sweeney gave her permission and they intended her to move in with them, but she changed her mind. They deny owing the council around £100,000 in care costs – or doing anything wrong.

Mrs Bone, who earns £45,000-a-year as her husband’s office manager, says the ordeal has taken a toll on her health. ‘In the last three weeks they found a lump on my breast. I’m convinced it’s the stress.

‘It’s ridiculous to think Peter would do something wrong and imply I have gone against my mum’s wishes.’

Her mother was feeling the strain too. ‘She knows it could be really bad for all of us. She thinks it’s wicked. In the worst-case scenario, if we were charged, convicted, whatever, I’m her only lifeline. Otherwise, she’s stuck in there 24/7.’

Mrs Bone’s desperation is clear. And it is shocking to hear the language used by the Bones, traditional Tories, about the police. ‘We have always been very supportive of them,’ said Mrs Bone. ‘It absolutely sucks.’

She falters as she recalls the day they raided their home in Rushden, Northamptonshire. ‘It was like being burgled. I won’t ever forget .  .  . a knock on the door and .  .  . Peter wasn’t there  .  .  . I couldn’t stop shaking.

Mr Bone and his wife have vowed to clear their names

‘I feel violated by that day. I relive it every single day. It’s something that you see on the telly .  .  . Frost or whatever.

Mr Bone’s sense of betrayal is just as deep. ‘I thought the police were great people who couldn’t do anything wrong. They have misled us. Some would say they lied to us. They raided our house and took our papers. We’ve only just got them back.

‘They promised they would not see Dorothy without telling us first. They went and video-taped her in the home. She had no representation, without any notice – and they refused to give her a copy of the tape.’

Mrs Bone’s simmering rage surfaces when asked about rumours that her husband will be kicked out of the Tory Party if the police charge them. ‘I’ll be damned if they force him . . . he’s done nothing wrong,’ she said, close to tears.

Her husband links the police action to his support for Mr Mitchell, who was accused of calling a policeman a ‘f***ing pleb’ outside No 10. ‘I went on BBC Newsnight and spoke up for him against the Police Federation. You could put one and one together and make two – this was them getting back at me for that.’

But his main concern is for his wife. ‘There’s no question the lump is because of the enormous stress that the county council and police have put on to us. We spend most of our time talking about this thing.’

The Bones have plenty more talking to do before it is over.

Police did not comment.
