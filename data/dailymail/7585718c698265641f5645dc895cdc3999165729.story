They're every curvy girl's secret weapon -- just ask Kim Kardashian and Princess Beatrice.

But while Spanx are known and loved for their figure-skimmimg effects, there's no denying they are not the most comfortable garment to be worn in the heat of summer.

But now the world's best-known brand of big knickers have unveiled a summer selection that won’t make you sweat on a warm day.

Don't sweat it! Spanx have unveiled their new Skinny Britches range in time for summer to help women look slim and stay cool at the same time

Spanx have just re-launched their Skinny Britches range in a fabric designed to make you feel slim and trim without feeling sweaty and constricted.

They’ve been designed to be lightweight and breathable, incorporating the same Spanx technology that you'd expect from the classic designs, but in a lightweight format.

The pants, which claim to firm the tummy, hips, thighs and bottom, have been created with ultra-light sheer fabric and cotton gusset, and a 'non-binding', unseamed waistband that won't dig in or create lumps and bumps.

All-in-one: The designs, which are 61 per cent Nylon, 39 per cent Lycra/Elastane, are available as skorts, shorts or all-in-one styles (£92)

Breathe easy: Each pair been designed to be lightweight and breathable with all the same Spanx technology that you'd expect from the classic designs

The designs, which are 61 per cent nylon, 39 per cent Lycra/elastane, are available as skorts, shorts or all-in-one styles and range in price between £24 for a thong and £92 for an all-in-one.

Previously a red carpet secret, Spanx 
are now proudly worn by A-listers such as Kourtney Kardashian, Gwyneth 
Paltrow, Princess Beatrice, Jessica Alba, Beyonce.

Even tiny-waisted Rochelle from the Saturdays admitted to wearing them under her 
wedding dress last year.

Famous fans: Princess Beatrice and Kourtney Kardashian are both fans of shapewear

Over 36,000 body-shapers are manufactured each day

To date, more than 5.4 million Spanx Power Panties have been sold 
worldwide – when Oprah announced she’d 'given up panties' and only wore 
Spanx, more than 20,000 pairs were sold that day alone

Founded in 2000, Spanx is headquartered in Atlanta

During the eight-hour manufacturing process of Spanx hosiery products, more than 40 women touch each pair

After kickstarting a shapewear revolution, the company now makes more than 200 figure-fixing products – from back-fat busting bras to bum-boosting bodysuits
