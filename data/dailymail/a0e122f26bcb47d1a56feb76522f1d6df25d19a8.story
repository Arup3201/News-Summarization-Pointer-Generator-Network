A family escaped their burning farmhouse after the building caught fire because rats chewed through their electric cables.

Four adults and children managed to get out of the historic property in Cheriton, Hampshire, on Sunday evening.

Firefighters today revealed that rodents were the reason the fire broke out in the roof of the building. Investigators found that rats had gnawed away the plastic insulation from the cables.
