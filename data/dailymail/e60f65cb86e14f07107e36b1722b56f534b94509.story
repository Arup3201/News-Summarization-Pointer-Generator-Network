A mother lost almost half her body weight after she got stuck in two rollers at a children’s soft play centre.

Emma Kingston, 29, put on weight after getting hooked on McDonald’s Big Macs and pizzas washed down with litres of full-fat coke.

At her heaviest, the mother-of-one, who is getting married to a professional chef, tipped the scales at 18st 3lbs and was a size 24.

Her weight became such a problem that she struggled to find clothes to fit her.

But Emma, a travel agent, finally decided to lose weight when she took her 18-month-old son Freddie to an indoor play zone in January last year and got wedged in the equipment.

It took two members of staff to haul her out two rollers which she had tried to squeeze through as she followed Freddie around the Crazy Knights centre in Oswestry, Shrops.

The day after her embarrassing rescue, Emma signed up to Slimming World and in 12 months she has shed seven stone to weigh 10st 12lbs and dropped to a size 12.

At her heaviest: Emma weighed around 18st due to her love of fast food washed down with fizzy drinks

Emma, from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, said: 'I couldn’t believe it, we got to the two rollers which are meant for kids but normal sized adults can fit through them but I started and just knew there was no way I could get through it.

'I suddenly got stuck. I was with my cousin and she had to carry on with Freddie while two members of staff helped get me out.

'It was so embarrassing having to go back the way I had come against all the people coming through the play centre.

'It was then that I signed up to Slimming World because something had to be done.

'I think before then I hadn’t realised how bad it had got. When I went back to work after seven months maternity leave I had to order a new uniform because I had put on weight.

'I had been a size 18 since after I had left school and got a job because I think when I left home I didn’t have mum’s cooking.

'I never had breakfast so I just got so hungry by lunchtime and would gorge then.

'My fiance Mark is a chef so people think that was why I got so big but it was the junk food I’d eat.

'I got so big I couldn’t sit on the floor because it was so uncomfortable and worried I wouldn’t be able to get up on my own so I just couldn’t play with Freddie.'

Emma, who lives with fiance Mark Jones, 33, is hoping to lose more weight to drop below 10st before the summer.

She added: 'We go back to Crazy Knights now regularly and I don’t get out of breath like I used to. I can keep up with Freddie. Before it was exhausting but I didn’t know anything else.

'Slimming World has really helped me because I can still have some of my favourite foods but have the barriers to stop me eating too much.

'Hopefully I have lost the weight in time so that Freddie won’t remember me being bigger.'
