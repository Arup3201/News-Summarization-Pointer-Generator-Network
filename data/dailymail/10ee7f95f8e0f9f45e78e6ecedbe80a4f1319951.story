What it feels like for a girl... A male Reddit user's post asking women for advice on what to do if he 'magically became a girl tomorrow' generated over 9,000 replies

Many women took to the forum to dispatch beauty advice. ‘Invest in economy size boxes of hair ties and bobby pins. Then be prepared to lose every last one in under month. Repeat every month,’ one woman by the name of Eyeofdelphi.  

‘Save your money and buy men's razors. They are just the same, except they're not pink, or scented, which makes them cheaper,’ chimed in another.

Fashion choices were also discussed. ‘Be prepared to walk home in the shoes you're wearing. If they would be too uncomfortable to do that, take along an alternate pair in which you could... Your 4am party feet will thank you,’ Dearness306 suggested.

Another cackled, ‘lol have fun not having pockets!’

Women all around agreed that the man would have a difficult time learning to walk in high heels.

Several female Reddit users banded together to direct the man to /r/ABraThatFits,
 a sub forum that is dedicated to finding a perfect bra match. Others 
simply advised him to, ‘Get measured for your bra. Don't guess.’

Kellianne
 advised, ‘If you find a shade of lipstick you like, or the perfect 
bra--stock up because they will be discontinued next week.’

The
 discussion gained so much traction it soon skyrocketed to the front 
page of the Reddit sub channel. ‘Thank you guys so much for getting me 
on the front page of AskReddit :D Internet High-Five’ tallguy49 posted.

As
 the advice poured in, many men on the forum questioned whether they’d 
be up for the challenge of womanhood. ‘I can get ready in the morning as
 a man in 15 minutes. Shower included. I've yet to meet a female who 
says the same. I don't have time to be a female!’ user Ogow said.

‘Being female sounds like a complex endeavor…,’ said buntciscuit817.

‘So
 what I gather from this thread is that if I become a woman tomorrow, 
stay inside and cry in the fetal position until I become a man again,’ 
lamented one man.

Men
 and women alike wondered if the man would be up for the challenge of 
pregnancy and the unique monthly pain he would feel as a result of his 
new biology.

‘Cramps
 suck really bad,’ wrote reiter761. Another advised, ‘If your period is 
late and you're starting to panic, just wear white pants and/or your 
nicest, most expensive underpants and before you know it you'll have a 
totally different reason to panic!’

Women
 on the forum provided a lot of practical advice surrounding pregnancy, 
and many implored him to begin taking birth control medication 
immediately post-anatomical switch.

‘Being
 pregnant is not easy. Getting pregnant is. Make sure it's something 
you're ready for, or be proactive about preventing it.’

The
 group also seemed to agree that most men would have a hard time 
adjusting to the daily discrimination women face. They warned him to 
avoid pervy coworkers, get used to people talking over him, and forgive 
unwarranted comments about body shape and appearance. ‘People will 
insult you by calling you fat whether you're fat or not, whether they 
have a reason to be insulting you or not. Cultivate a realistic body 
image.’

It
 wasn’t all bad news though, users pointed out that with his new female 
status he could now feel free to cry without judgement, enjoy more free 
drinks at the bar, and experience the unique comfort of stretch pants 
and leggings.

And if, as a new woman, tallguy49 decides to look for a man? ‘the bend and snap!’ cried one user, ‘really does work every time!’
