As she stepped out of her car onto the driveway, Beth Redpath felt her throat prickle with the warning signs of an allergic reaction.

'I started to flush bright red, and within a few minutes I felt like my throat was closing up and I was struggling to breathe,' recalls Beth, 28. 'Angry red weals began to appear on my arms and neck, and I started to panic.'

She was suffering anaphylactic shock - a severe and life-threatening allergic reaction causing swelling of the throat and mouth, problems breathing and a dangerous drop in blood pressure.

Luckily her mother was with her, and called 999 as well as injecting her with an EpiPen - a device containing adrenaline to counter the allergic reaction.

'But even after the injection, my blood pressure dropped so low that I passed out in the ambulance,' says Beth.

'My body was shutting down and only providing blood to my vital organs, such as my heart and lungs. It was terrifying. Mum thought that she was going to lose me.'

Beth is one of an estimated 600,000 people in Britain with an allergy to latex - a natural substance obtained from rubber trees. It is used to make around 40,000 products, including car tyres, airbags, some medical gloves, condoms, balloons, paints and even tarmac - which can make it very difficult to avoid.

Beth's attack was triggered by roadworks in her street: 'A telephone company had dug up the pavement without any notice and laid fresh tarmac. Particles of latex in the tarmac had become airborne and I'd inhaled them.'

Allergies are caused by the immune system over-reacting to a normally harmless substance, in the mistaken belief that it is a foreign invader. This triggers the immune system to release the compound histamine, which causes symptoms such as itching and swelling.

In extreme cases, allergic reactions can send the body into anaphylactic shock.

Although most people with a latex allergy will have only an itchy skin rash reaction (known as a type 4 reaction), repeated exposure can make the allergy far worse, and in some cases it can progress to the most serious type of reaction - type 1.

Symptoms start immediately after exposure and include hives, hayfever-type problems, wheezing and, in some cases, anaphylaxis. Worryingly, you can have a full-blown anaphylactic reaction without ever having experienced any symptoms previously.

Beth's trip to hospital was just the latest of 27 emergency admissions she's had in the past 18 months - testament to how hard it is to avoid latex in everyday life.

One attack occurred in a restaurant after Beth had been drinking champagne. She later discovered that latex was used as a binding agent in champagne corks ('it helps preserve the champagne, apparently').

'I even had one attack in a hospital foyer as a breast cancer charity was handing out latex balloons,' says the marketing manager, who lives with her parents and son Jack, five, in Woking, Surrey.

'Now, if I go to a supermarket or shopping centre, I wear a particle filtration mask over my nose and mouth - like the ones people wore in Hong Kong at the height of the bird flu scare - just in case there is airborne latex from food prepared or packed by workers wearing latex gloves.

'It's the only way I can guarantee my safety in public places.'

Latex allergy became a health problem in Britain and globally in the Eighties when medical workers started to wear latex gloves to prevent cross infection with the HIV/Aids virus.

As well as being made of latex, the gloves used then contained powders that propelled the latex particles into the air, making them more easily inhaled.

Although most NHS trusts now use latex-free medical products, there are still large numbers of the population who remain sensitised to latex, says Dr Gavin Spickett, consultant immunologist at Newcastle Royal Infirmary.

'We are seeing fewer new cases of latex allergy in the UK thanks to healthcare workers using latex-free gloves, but the problem certainly hasn't disappeared.'

'I've turned my home into a latex-free zone - it's the only place I feel totally safe.'

One of the biggest threats comes from a seemingly innocuous item - party balloons.

'A major problem is the hazard of latex balloons used for promotional activities in shopping centres and restaurants,' adds Dr Spickett, who is chairman of the Latex Allergy Support Group's medical advisory panel. 'Most stretchy, rubbery balloons contain latex; foil balloons do not.

'And when paints and tarmac are freshly applied or stripped off, particles of latex can become airborne, so that it is another potential source of allergens.

'People just don't realise how dangerous a latex allergy can be. Even some medical staff confuse type 1 and type 4 allergies and tend to think latex allergy causes nothing more serious than an itchy rash - not realising that it could kill someone.'

And those with latex allergies don't need even to come into close contact with the substance says Aleksandra Kinay, chair of the Latex Allergy Support Group.

'Just being in the same room as latex gloves can be enough to trigger an attack,' she warns. 'Some surgeons still prefer to wear latex gloves, and hospitals allow balloons on the premises, so there's no room for complacency.'

Many latex allergy sufferers also develop a cross-reactivity to some fruits and vegetables, as they contain similar proteins, adds Jonathan Brostoff, professor emeritus of allergy at King's College, London, and a medical adviser to the Anaphylaxis Campaign.

'The body mistakes proteins in certain fruits and vegetables for the proteins in latex and mounts an allergic response,' says the professor. 'The main triggers are bananas, avocados, kiwis and chestnuts, but others can cause problems, too.'

Beth Redpath started suffering itchy red rashes at 16 after using latex gloves in science lessons at school. 'At university, I studied biochemistry so often worked in a laboratory. It was difficult to avoid exposure to latex gloves and other equipment, such as latex caps on bottles. At 21, the allergy worsened and I had to give up my career in biochemistry.'

Lesley Maitland, 47, a former bank worker who lives in Sunderland with her husband Scott and four children, had to take medical retirement because her employer could not guarantee her a safe work environment.

'Everything from elastic bands to hair lacquer in the toilets set me off,' she says. 'Even my trade union unwittingly triggered an attack by sending me a squeezy stress ball which contained latex.

'I've turned my home into a latex-free zone - it's the only place I feel totally safe.'

Lesley is convinced she became sensitised to latex as a child living close to factories that made tyres and condoms in London's East End. 'Once, I even had an attack when a car braked sharply and burnt the rubber on its tyres in front of me.

'I don't want to sound like a killjoy, but latex balloons could be fatal if I encountered them in a confined space. It's a constant battle to persuade businesses to take this risk seriously.

'People don't realise that a latex allergy can be deadly and that latex is found everywhere.'
