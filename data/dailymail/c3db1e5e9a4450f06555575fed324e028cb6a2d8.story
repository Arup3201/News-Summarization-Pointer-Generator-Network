Team news

Sunderland

Full-back Anthony Reveillere is out of Sunderland's Boxing Day clash with Hull and will not play again until the new year.

Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet faces a decision on whether to field skipper John O'Shea

The Frenchman suffered a calf injury in the warm-up before Sunday's 1-0 derby victory at Newcastle and will be sidelined for up to four weeks.

Head coach Gus Poyet faces a decision on whether to field skipper John O'Shea in his place, as he did at St James' Park, or turn to fit-again specialist Billy Jones, who has recovered from a hamstring problem, while midfielder Emanuele Giaccherini is also in contention following his return from an ankle injury. Striker Connor Wickham serves a one-match ban for an accumulation of bookings.

Provisional squad: Pantilimon, Mannone, Jones, Brown, O'Shea, Vergini, Coates, Cattermole, Rodwell, Bridcutt, Gomez, Larsson, Johnson, Buckley, Alvarez, Mavrias, Giaccherini, Fletcher, Altidore.

Hull

Hull are stretched to the limit for their trip to Sunderland on Boxing Day.

Midfielders Jake Livermore and Tom Huddlestone are suspended, Mohamed Diame is out with a knee problem and centre-half Michael Dawson has a torn hamstring.

Paul McShane and Hatem Ben Arfa are both exiled from the squad and captain Curtis Davies (calf) is a doubt but Tom Ince and Maynor Figueroa have been recalled from loan spells.

Provisional squad: McGregor, Jakupovic, Davies, Rosenior, McShane, Figueroa, Robertson, Chester, Bruce, Elmohamady, Meyler, Ince, Brady, Aluko, Quinn, Ramirez, Hernandez, Aluko, Jelavic, Sagbo.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Sunderland have lost just one of their last six Premier League Boxing Day fixtures (W2 D3 L1).

Hull City have lost their two previous Boxing Day PL games (1-5 to Man City and 2-3 to Man Utd).

There have been just eight goals scored in the Black Cats’ last six Boxing Day games in the Premier League.

Current Hull boss Steve Bruce was manager of Sunderland between June 2009 and November 2011 winning 28 per cent of his 89 Premier League games in charge.

There have been six red cards in six Premier League meetings between these two sides, including five in the last three games alone.

Wes Brown was sent off in just the fourth minute following his foul on Hull's Shane Long, who went on to score for the Tigers in their 2-0 Premier League win at the Stadium of Light back in February

Sunderland won the first four Premier League matches with Hull City but have lost the last two.

Steve Bruce was the winning manager in the last four, twice for Sunderland the last two times as Hull coach.

Mohamed Diame has scored three goals against Sunderland, more than against any other opponent in his Premier League career.

Costel Pantilimon has tasted defeat in only two of his 15 Premier League appearances (for Sunderland and Man City).

Of goalkeepers to have played seven or more games this season, the Romanian stopper has the best save percentage (82.1 per cent).

Only Manchester United (31) have used more players this season than Steve Bruce’s Hull City side (27).
