A trainee barrister falsely accused her boyfriend of raping her 11 times in an attempt to get out of taking her law exams, a court heard.

Rhiannon Brooker, 30, alleged Paul Fensome had repeatedly assaulted her, leading to the 46-year-old being arrested, charged and held in custody for 30 days.

But detectives could not find any evidence he had carried out the attacks. It emerged that Brooker had used the allegations as ‘extenuating circumstances’ in a failed attempt to dodge her bar exams, a jury was told.

Rhiannon Brooker, 30, is accused of falsely claiming her boyfriend raped and assaulted her before using the allegations as 'extenuating circumstances' in a failed bid to get out of her legal exams

She is accused of making 11 false 
claims of rape and nine of assault, two of which alleged false 
imprisonment.

Prosecutor David Bartlett told Bristol Crown Court: ‘One 
of the reasons for her false allegations was that she was living an 
active social life and not doing the work required to pass.’

She made up the claims to ‘give substance’ to her bid to be allowed to delay her exams.

The
 court heard how Brooker, a law graduate, had been studying for her 
barrister qualifications at the University of the West of England (UWE).

Shortly before she moved 
to Bristol in 2010, she appeared at a shop where she worked with 
injuries and complained her boyfriend had assaulted her, Mr Bartlett 
said.

At UWE she told fellow
 students she had been assaulted and raped, and occasionally displayed 
physical injuries, but had not reported the matter to police.

She 
claimed Mr Fensome had forced her to have sex on several occasions and 
once she told a friend she had lost a baby because he had punched her in
 the ribs.

She said facial injuries and bruising were as a result of her attempts to end the relationship against his will.

In March 2011 a domestic violence adviser encouraged her to keep a log of incidents and report them to police.

She finally went to police in May 2011 but all the allegations were denied by Mr Fensome, a railway signalman.

She told officers she had been grabbed by the throat and held against a wall after Mr Fensome accused her of cheating on him.

The
 court saw a video of a police interview in which she said: ‘He got 
increasingly irritated and angry because of the fact I was denying it.

‘He was accusing me of all sorts with all people.

‘As
 we got home he tripped me up as we were coming through the door and I 
fell down.

'I said to stop being so stupid, then he grabbed me by the 
throat and put me against the wall.

'He put his hand around my neck and 
throat, his grip was tight, I found it hard to breathe. He said I was 
malicious and nasty.’

However, Mr Fensome denied the allegations and had ‘cast iron alibis’, the court heard.

Texts
 from his phone and his work shift patterns either undermined or 
disproved the claims. Experts suggested Brooker’s injuries had been 
self-inflicted, Mr Bartlett said.

After
 charges against Mr Fensome were dropped, Brooker, of Frampton 
Cotterell, Gloucestershire, confirmed they were false, and admitted that
 injuries seen by witnesses, including her friends and doctors, were 
self-inflicted, the court heard.

She
 later told police: ‘The allegations were not true and I am sorry I made
 them. I find it very difficult to understand why I said these things.

‘I
 believe that in some funny way I have hit out against Paul as he was 
close to me – the nearest target of those unresolved feelings of anger –
 and I regret the hurt that I’ve caused him as a result.

‘I
 am trying to work hard with these feelings and I understand that they 
have to be resolved and put behind me.

'Ordinarily I am a truthful and 
honest person which makes it all the more difficult for me to understand
 how this has happened.’ 

Brooker sat only the first four of her 12 
assessments for her course and persuaded the Extenuating Circumstances 
Committee to let her sit the rest later. But she went on to fail because
 she exceeded the time limit.

Mr Bartlett said Brooker’s knowledge of criminal law was likely to be greater than that of most rape complainants.

‘The
 prosecution alleges that she knew that the course of justice was being 
perverted and intended to pervert the course of justice throughout that 
period.

'Brooker seemed oblivious to the impact of the false allegations 
on Mr Fensome’s family, causing distress, disruption and expense.

'In 
addition, Brooker deceived other students and her tutors, who committed 
time and emotional support to her cause.

‘We
 suggest that the defendant has an inherent tendency to fabricate 
allegations and needs always to be the centre of attention.’

Brooker denies perverting the course of justice. The trial continues.
