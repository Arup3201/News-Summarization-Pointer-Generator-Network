A grand jury has indicted a former attorney on charges he strangled his ex-wife and tossed her off a cruise ship in Italy almost seven years ago.

The Orange County Register says 55-year-old Lonnie Kocontes, of Florida, didn't enter a plea at his arraignment on Monday. He was indicted on Friday on a charge of murder for financial gain.

He'll try to have the case dismissed at a June 26 hearing, arguing that local authorities lack jurisdiction to prosecute.

Mr Kocontes and 52-year-old Micki Kanesaki were divorced but had lived together on and off in Mission Viejo.

They were sharing a cabin on a 2006 cruise when she went overboard. Her body later washed ashore.

An investigation began after Lonnie Kocontes began taking money from her accounts. He was arrested earlier this year.

The cruise ship trip was meant to rekindle their failed marriage.

But Lonnie Kocontes was arrested in Safety Harbor, Florida in February and indicted with the 2006 murder of Micki Kanesaki.

Kocontes
told police that Kanesaki, whom he was divorced from at the time, left 
their cabin around 1 a.m. for a cup of tea on May 26, 2006, but never 
returned. He later suggested she may have been suicidal.

Kanesaki's body was found the next day after washing on shore in Calabria, in southwest Italy.

At the time investigators suggested that foul play was not involved but an autopsy later revealed she had been strangled, KCAL reports.

Kocontes said the cruise was meant to rekindle their failed marriage that withstood both
her two-time arrest for domestic assault and his for sexual acts and lewd 
conduct on a child - his charges later dropped.

Kocontes
told authorities that his ex-wife had previously talked of committing 
suicide suggesting it as a possible reason for her death. That was a 
claim her mother fiercely denied.

'There's no reason to believe it was a suicide,' her mother Setsuko Kanesaki told the OC Register through a translator in 2006.

She said her daughter appeared particularly upbeat before their trip and had plans to see them after her return.

Kanesaki's father also told KCAL in 2006 he suspected Kocontes had something to do with it.

Home: The couple who divorced after six years of marriage in 2002 continued to live together in this Southern California house they both legally owned and later fought over its sale

Denial: Kanesaki's family denied allegations that their daughter was suicidal with her father, seen here in 2006, saying he believed Kocontes might have something to do with it

'I
was committed to this woman,' Kocontes told the LA Times just after her
death. 'I loved her with all my heart. I wish I never had gone on the 
cruise.'

The couple divorced after six years 
of marriage in 2002 but continued to live together in the Southern 
California house they both legally owned for a few years after their 
split.

During this time Kanesaki was 
arrested for domestic violence and ordered to attend a program with 
Kocontes. After her second arrest in January of 2003 for kicking her 
ex-husband in the leg, she enrolled herself in anger management classes 
as well as an Alcoholics Anonymous program.

Kocontes had his own arrests as well including the 1999 arrest for sexual acts and lewd conduct on a girl under 
16. Those charges were dropped after the girl allegedly became too distraught to testify in court, the LA Times reports.

After their divorce Kocontes later briefly remarried for a few months and around the fall of 2005 he asked a judge to force Kanesaki to sell their Landera Ranch home and split the proceeds.

That case was dismissed after both failed to show up in court. Just several months later they embarked on the cruise that was said to have been an effort to give their marriage another go.

Kocontes told police their relationship was getting better and they weren't fighting on the trip but instead discussed remarrying that November.
