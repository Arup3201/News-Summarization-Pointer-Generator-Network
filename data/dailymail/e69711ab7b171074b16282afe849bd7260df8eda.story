Tragic: Amelia Saunders, 4, attended her last day at school before an inoperable brain tumour takes her life

For most school children, the end of the Christmas term is a happy occasion with the promise of gifts and festivities to come.

But for one four-year-old, it proved decidedly more poignant.

Amelia Saunders went into school today for the final time before an inoperable brain tumour takes her life.

Her father, Richard Saunders, said: 'I can't really 
describe how we feel right now. Scared, perhaps. We have to say goodbye 
soon to our baby, our angel. She is as much a part of us as we are of 
her. When she is gone, a huge part of us will go with her.

‘There are so many things in our lives ahead where that hole will show.’

Amelia has already defied the odds that were stacked against her by surviving longer than the few weeks doctors gave her at the start of 2012 when they discovered the advanced tumour on her brain stem.

Her parents, Mr Saunders and wife Chantal, from near Reading in Berkshire, refused to accept the devastating news at first and looked to America for clinical trials.

Amelia's plight was taken up by 
hundreds of fundraisers who raised £200,000 in just 12 weeks to send her
to Houston for experimental treatment.

As
part of the fundraising campaign Amelia opened shops, firefighters 
cycled around the country and stalls were set up all to raise money.

Her condition improved so much she 
started the foundation stage at independent Crosfields School in Reading
and began writing her name.

She
is also the current holder of Pride of Reading Child of Courage 2012 
award and attended the ceremony to collect it in person at the end of 
November.

Poignant: Amelia's father, Richard Saunders wrote on his blog that he hoped his daughter would be able to 'say goodbye to her school friends and give them that smile we all know.'

However, her father Mr Saunders said he only had a short time left with their daughter.

In his regular blog on the Amelia's Miracle Facebook page where he keeps supporters updated with their lives, he said: ‘Amelia managed to go to school for a few hours this morning (Wed) but Friday will be her last day.

‘It will be another school day like all the rest - but one where the teachers will know she will not be back again. Chantal and I know this isn't going to be easy.

'Amelia will not know, but there will be an empty chair at her table next term.

‘Hoping tomorrow (Fri) Amelia can say goodbye to her school friends and give them that smile we all know. No tears, just smiles.’

He said they noticed Amelia deteriorating at the end of August and she has visited Great Ormond Street Hospital.

However they fear the tumour is growing and is affecting Amelia's spine and therefore control of her lower body.

She is set to spend some days in a hospice next week.

He paid tribute to his daughter's courage: ‘Amelia became a star. She always was a star to us, but she became known to everyone who saw her, and loved by all.

'She touched the hearts of so many thousands of people, from all over the world, and the love poured in, in return.

‘In turn, Chantal and my hearts were lifted by this and we felt so driven to fight our way through this.

‘I know she will always be there, alongside us. I know I want to go with her but can't, because I have to be strong for Chan and Charlotte.

‘But this does not make the pain go away. All of you who have shared our journey will feel a little of this right now.

'A star': Amelia's father spoke of his daughter's courage and said he does not have long left with his daughter

A story that we all wanted a happy ending to. One we could all have our say in, make a difference, and inspire others with.

‘A story of hope and of a little girl who showed us all what fighting spirit means. A dream of beating one of the worst cancers known to mankind.’
