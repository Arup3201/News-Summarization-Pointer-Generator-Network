Former Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon is backing Carlo Ancelotti after the Italian has come under fire in recent weeks because of his side's poor form.

The Champions League holders squeezed past Schalke on Tuesday despite losing 4-3 at home and were booed off by the home fans.

But Calderon believes Real would be making a mistake if they got rid of Ancelotti. 

Carlo Ancelotti has come under increasing pressure following some disappointing results from his side

He told TalkSport: 'It would be very premature and I don't think it would be a wise decision.'

'We are finishing the season and things are not too bad. I hope things can turn around.

'We are only one point behind [La Liga leaders] Barcelona and still in the Champions League. We can win both championships.'

With La Liga set for an exciting climax, Real know they can't afford to slip up anymore this season with Barcelona looking in formidable form.

Ancelotti's men travel to the Nou Camp on March 22 for a title showdown, knowing that if they get beaten then the trophy will be returning to Catalonia.
