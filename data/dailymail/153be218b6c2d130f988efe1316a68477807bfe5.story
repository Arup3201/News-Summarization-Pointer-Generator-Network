Meet the hefty members of Britain’s latest fit club.

Daisy the bulldog and Poppy the rabbit are among porky pets in the PDSA’s competition to highlight the dangers of animal obesity.

The charity will put 17 pets through a six-month diet and exercise programme overseen by vets, leading to one being crowned a super slimmer.

Daisy, from Middlesbrough, weighs in at 4st 6lb, which is 50 per cent heavier than she should be.

She has already hit the treadmill in an attempt to shed the pounds.

Poppy is a third heavier than she should be at more than 7lb – mainly due to a taste for popcorn.

Other candidates include a cat that can open the fridge and a Jack Russell with a taste for doner kebabs.

According
 to the PDSA, pet obesity levels are at worryingly high levels. Around 
one in three dogs and one in four cats are said to be overweight.

Zorro, a three-year-old ginger Tom from Dundee, has a whopping 63cm waist and is double the size he should be, weighing a hefty 9.4kg.

Devoted owner, Linda Petrie, 51, who adopted Zorro a year ago, now has to use baby wipes to keep her moggy clean, as he struggles to groom himself due to his size.

Linda says that his eating habits have also become a bit of a pain: he is very demanding and often wakes Linda in the middle of the night for his favourite snack, cheese and onion crisps.

A fellow competing cat, Tom from Glasgow, is also classed as morbidly obese and has become so addicted to food he has learned to feed himself.

The black and white kitty has got such an appetite he can now open the fridge door with his paw and force open cupboard doors as he is not satisfied with three pouches of food a day.

His owner Elizabeth Molloy, from Glasgow turned to the PDSA after she found it easier to pick up her one-year-old granchild than her chubby cat.

Elizabeth admits that she hasn't helped the situation, having indulged Tom's sweet tooth by feeding him ice cream. She says that since she moved into sheltered accomodation 18 months ago, his weight issues have worsened.

'He's a house cat but in my previous home he had room to run up and down the stairs. But since I moved, he's not getting the exercise.'

She also blames her cat's incessant appetite for his extra pounds, saying that he will stop at nothing to get his food fix.

'He's also very greedy. I have another cat, Angel, who is the perfect weight. But I have to put her food away when Tom's about because he will steal it.'

And it's not just cats who are cramming, podgy Poppy and jiggly Joey are two bulbous bunnies from Aberdeen.

Despite owning a perfectly proportioned English setter, the rabbits' owner Donna Manson, 48, said that her bunnies just piled on the pounds.

Poppy, who loves to snack on popcorn, weighs 3.3kg - around 30 per cent more than she should.

While Joey tips the scales at 3.85kg, making him 28 percent overweight. 

Donna said that her rabbits are not dissimilar to us, piling on the pounds over winter, the peak time for comfort eating.

'Over the winter time I think we just bulked them up a bit too much. We've now cut the treats right back but we have been feeding them portions that are probably too large.

Donna says that she had no idea that some of the treats she was giving to her bunnies were so fattening.

'I've tried to cut down on the carrots and apples, as I've recently learned that they are both high in sugar and not the healthy snacks I thought they were.

'Another thing that came to light was that I'd often give them a little treat during the day and when my daughter got back from college she hadn't realised I'd given them a snack and she would give them something too.'

The Pet Fit Club has been running for nine years and has helped animals lose a combined weight of 46 stone

PDSA Pet Fit Club was launched in 2005 and has already helped 57 dogs, 24 cats and 3 rabbits lose a total of 295kg (46 stone 6lb).

This weight loss is the equivalent of nearly 300 bags of sugar, more than 4,400 sausages, 740 tins of dog food or over 1,000 blocks of lard.

Senior Veterinary Surgeon, Andy Cage, from Dundee PetAid hospital, said that having over weight animals is not just a nuisance, it is also an issue of cruelty.

'Obesity is one of the biggest welfare issues affecting pets in the UK today. Sadly, it also means millions of pets are at risk from potentially life-threatening health problems related to obesity.

'But the good news is that obesity is entirely reversible.'
