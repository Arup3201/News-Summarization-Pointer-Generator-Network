They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but this one will be worth a thousand years. 

Jonathon Keats, a conceptual artist and journalist, plans to capture the world's longest photo exposure, PetaPixel reports.

A camera filled with oil paint instead of photographic film will capture the 1,000-year-long exposure of Tempe, Arizona.

Keats calls this and similar creations 'deep time cameras.' 

Exposure: Jonathon Keats (photographed), a conceptual artist and journalist, plans to capture the world's longest photo exposure, a 1,000-year-long exposure of Tempe, Arizona

The camera, with a 24-karat gold plate on its front, will be installed three feet above ground at the Arizona State University Art Museum's sculpture garden trellis after it is unveiled Friday at the museum. 

The camera will be pointed at the city's skyline, capturing how civilization changes over the next 1,000 years. 

Over time, the color in the paint will fade where the light enters the camera the brightest, slowly -- very slowly -- creating an image of the Tempe skyline in red and white.  

The experiment will be finished in spring 3015 and the museum will hold a month-long exhibit when the project is complete -- if everything goes according to plan in the next 1,000 years, of course, Slate reports. 

'The first people to see this picture will be children who haven't yet been conceived,' Keats told PetaPixel. 

'They're impacted by every choice we make, but they're powerless. If they can't influence our decisions, at least they can bear witness.'

This experiment will be one Keats won't live to see, neither will his children, nor his children's children, nor his children's children's child- okay, you get the point. But Keats told PetaPixel that he doesn't mind being not being able to attend the exposure's unveiling in 3015.

'I'll be dead,' Keats said.

'But I don't regret it at all. For me, it's much more interesting to be here today, seeing the behavior of people who know they're being watched by the unborn, and also to be watched myself, living vicariously as a future memory of the next millennium.'

Keats told Slate that the resulting photos won't be confusing, but will require a bit of interpretation to deconstruct what is recorded in the photo.

He told PetaPixel that the photograph will not only show Tempe's skyline, but will illustrate how it develops over time.

'For instance, old houses torn down after a couple centuries will show up only faintly, as if they were ghosts haunting the skyscrapers that replace them,' Keats said.

Keats told Slate that he can't guarantee that the picture will be perfect or even perceptible. In fact, he said, it may take multiple attempts to get the exposure just right -- that could take thousands of years. But he said he does not see that as a fault.

'A total failure photographically could still be a success conceptually,' he said. 

Keats said he chose Tempe because it is representative of urban expansion throughout the United States. He said he plans to install a second camera in Massachusetts.
