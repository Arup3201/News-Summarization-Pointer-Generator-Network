Former Celtic striker Chris Sutton claims the Scottish champions can lift their early-season gloom by going all the way in the Europa League.

Sutton was part of the Celtic side which bounced back from a Champions League defeat to Basle by beating the likes of Blackburn and Liverpool on their way to a UEFA Cup final against Porto in 2003.

And the Englishman feels there is no reason why Ronny Deila cannot follow in Martin O'Neill's footsteps by leading his team into the latter stages this season.

Ronny Deila's side have endured a torrid start, but ended a four-straight run of defeats on Saturday

Deila has suffered a torrid start to life at Celtic Park - bowing out of the Champions League against both Legia Warsaw and Maribor after an initial reprieve.

But his captain, Scott Brown, returned from a hamstring injury as Celtic ended a four-match run without victory by beating Aberdeen 2-1 on Saturday.

And the Norwegian has brought in new recruits such as wingers Aleksandar Tonev and Mubarak Wakaso plus strikers Stefan Scepovic and John Guidetti, although the latter is ineligible for the group stages, which begin for Celtic in Austria this week.

Sutton, speaking to promote BT Sport's exclusively live coverage of Salzburg v Celtic on Thursday, said: 'The Europa League has a totally new dimension now with the fact that the winners go straight into the Champions League. Why can't it be Celtic?

'The season has started and things haven't gone to plan in European competition but Celtic can put that right now. They have more options up front now and have pace to counter-attack with Tonev and Mubarak.

'Things change quickly in football. There is a bit of doom and gloom about the Champions League now but that's gone now. Celtic could win in the treble and could go on a good run in the Europa League and go on and win it.

'It's hard playing at a big club when results don't go for you but you have to take the flak. It's about being courageous, showing character, and there's nothing that a couple of good results can't turn round.'

Sutton recalled how their Champions League defeat by Basle had the unexpected effect of inspiring them to one of the club's most memorable cup runs in 2003.

'At various times at Celtic off the back of bad results, there is nothing worse than the feeling you have in the pit of your stomach after the game,' the former Norwich, Blackburn and Chelsea forward said.

'I was lucky, I had managers and team-mates around who felt the same but used that as a motivation to come back and not have that feeling again.

'You stick together, and that's what the players have to do now. They have good players and can go from strength to strength.

'I'm glad (Virgil) van Dijk stayed and Brown has a big impact on the team, and I think they can go from strength to strength.

'It's vitally important for the season. I think this competition is the biggest one Celtic are in. It's the one they can concentrate on. I'm excited by it. I think they can afford to lose games in the league and still win it.

'Albeit they have had a Champions League exit, Ronny Deila has brought in players that will spice up the attacking intentions.'
