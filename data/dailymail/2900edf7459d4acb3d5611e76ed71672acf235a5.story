Shocking discovery: Anastasia Voykina, 23, was found dead in her south London flat at 2am yesterday

Felipe Lopes, pictured left and right with his girlfriend Anastasia, was last seen on Saturday in Piccadilly, central London. Police have now issued a warning to all ports in a bid to prevent him from leaving the UK

All airports and ports have been put on an alert for him.

Miss Voykina's body was discovered after a missing persons report was filed on Sunday afternoon. It is understood she had suffered a number of injuries.

Her next of kin have been informed and a post-mortem is due to take place today at 4pm at Greenwich Mortuary.

Police believe the couple first met in London while Miss Voykina was on holiday in the summer. She is believed to have returned to Russia but travelled back to London in recent weeks in an effort to continue their relationship.

But her family grew alarmed after not being able to contact Miss Voykina, and her brother Sergei left a desperate message online pleading for information about his sister's whereabouts on Sunday.

In the message he said: 'I'm writing here cause the situation can't wait. Because it seems like she is lost. Her last contact with us, I mean with family, was exactly a week ago.

'It is a long time for is to start worry, cause usually we chat together day by day or so. This is not a joke. We are really worried about her. An I'm asking you, everybody who knows her, who know where she could be at the moment or any information about her, please send a message.'

Tragic: A neighbour at the Streatham flats told today how he heard Miss Voykina screaming before she was murdered

Romance: Police believe Miss Voykina met Mr Lopes while holidaying in London in the summer and returned from Russia in recent weeks to continue their relationship

Just weeks before her death, Miss Voykina posted messages on Facebook saying how happy she was and how she looked forward to celebrating Christmas with her boyfriend.

In a message posted on December 17 she wrote: 'We've got a Christmas tree!! Yay!! I', sooo happy! Thank u soooo much my Santa!'

A neighbour told today how he heard Miss Voykina screaming before she was murdered.

He said there had been numerous occasions in the past when he had believed she was being attacked.

The man, who asked not to be named, said: 'Two weeks ago there was an incident down there. First we heard banging like he was kicking the walls or something.

'This building is made of wood. The whole place shakes if you slam the door.

'Then we heard the girl scream out. At that point it went dead for a little while and we called the police.

Investigation: The neighbour said he believed he had heard Miss Voykina being attacked at the flat on several occasions

'They came, a red car and a silver marked car. They knocked on the door, spoke to someone, the red car went away while the silver one stayed parked outside. After that it was just quiet, nothing happened.'

He added: 'We were going to call the police again. She screamed out but then it went deadly quiet. Then we didn't hear anything again then, funnily enough, until the day that police came.

'[On Sunday] about 1.30am, police kicked down the door. All we heard was a bang. I jumped out of bed because it sounded like our door being kicked in. There was about five or six police, normal CID.

'After the girl finished screaming we have not heard anything from downstairs. It was quiet and then all of a sudden he could hear someone say either "where are my keys?" or "where's my phone?".

'Then I heard two noises like banging on the against the wall or floor. Then there was silence.

Mystery: A neighbour said he had heard banging and shouting in their maisonette, followed by silence

'I didn't think anything about it. It was almost exactly the same as the previous incident. Like watching a move being replayed except this time no one came out.'

He added: 'If there is any trouble at all in this place you hear it.

'Nine months ago I went to the council and asked to be moved and you know what they did? They switched the lights on outside. It's disgusting, it is a living hell.'

Detective Chief Inspector Sheila Stewart, who is leading the inquiry for Homicide and Serious Crime Command, said: 'I am releasing this image of Felipe 
Lopes as I believe he holds vital information in relation to the murder 
of Anastasia Voykina. The image shows Lopes on the 6 January at approx 
8pm.

'We know that Anastasia was spoken to on Sunday December 30 so we are appealing for anyone who spoke to either her or Mr Lopes since then to contact us.

'We are also urging anyone who sees Mr Lopes or knows of his whereabouts to come forward. Please do not approach him but contact the police.'

There has been no arrest at present.
