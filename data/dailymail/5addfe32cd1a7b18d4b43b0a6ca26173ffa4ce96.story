The pictures tell the story of recovery, but more importantly, of love.

Millions of viewers around the world found themselves touched when a picture appeared online showing a man teaching his elderly partner how to read again after suffering a stroke.

The image was taken in a Starbucks, where 82-year-old John Allen takes his long-term partner Linda Alexander, 70, six days-a-week.

Love: The picture of John Allen, 82, teaching his partner Linda Alexander, 72, how to read after she suffered brain damage from a stroke that was posted on website Reddit

After falling ill five years ago, Miss Alexander suffered severe brain damage following a stroke, losing much of her memory.

To aid her recovery, My Allen has taken it upon himself to teach his partner how to read again, using flashcards over their morning beverage.

A picture of the couple, who have been together for 11 years, was taken by a fellow customer, who posted it on the internet saying he was 'overwhelmed by the love the couple showed for each other'.

Touchingly, Miss Alexander told an interviewer that for a long time after her illness the only words she could say were ‘I love you’.

She told NBC: 'I’m still enjoying my life, you know? I'm not sad. I'm not angry.'

The pensioner, whose right side of the body is still partially-paralysed, said that she still had ambition to drive and was determined to read.

As well as making time to go for lunch every day, Mr Allen also takes her to the gym three times a week to help her build up strength in the right side of her body.

The couple's affection was initially captured by Matthew Ballestero.

It was posted on website Reddit, where it has since been viewed by more than two million people, with the caption 'Patience, love and 
understanding at its finest'.

After meeting the couple, Ballestero explained: 'My friends and I were overwhelmed
by the love that these two had for each other, and I knew I wanted to 
let them know how much of an inspiration and a perfect example of true 
love they were to me.'

He added: 'You may be losing your memory, 
Linda, but the love that you and John have for each other will never be 
lost. Thank you for your beautiful example, Linda and John.'

Speech is often impaired in victims of strokes.

Earlier this month, broadcaster Andrew Marr was admitted to hospital having suffered a stroke at the age of only 53.
