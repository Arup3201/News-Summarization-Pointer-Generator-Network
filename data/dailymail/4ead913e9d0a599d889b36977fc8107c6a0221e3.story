The row over the Tory MP who attended a Nazi-themed stag night intensified last night after party chairman Grant Shapps was forced to intervene – and admitted that Aidan Burley had given a version of events that ‘conflicted’ with The Mail on Sunday’s  eye witness account.

Despite condemnation of Mr Burley’s actions, Mr Shapps refused to reopen the inquiry into the events at a French ski resort.

Mr Burley resigned as a ministerial aide after admitting ‘clearly inappropriate behaviour’ at the 2011 stag do, where revellers, including the groom, Mark Fournier, in a Nazi  uniform, chanted pro-Hitler slogans and gave Nazi salutes.

Last week, we published a photo of Mr Burley at the Frog & Roastbeef in Val Thorens – exposing as a lie his testimony to a party investigation that he had not been present when friends chanted ‘Hitler’ and ‘Himmler’.

We also published the transcript of a tape recording made by our reporter in the pub, in which – against a backdrop of Nazi chants – a member of Mr Burley’s group identifies him as MP for Cannock Chase in Staffordshire. Mr Burley can also be heard. 

However, in a letter to The Mail on Sunday, Mr Shapps insists: ‘While you have highlighted a conflict around the factual account of the precise events of the evening, this conflict does not impact on the report’s substantial conclusion’ – that Mr Burley had not been motivated by racism or anti-Semitism.

His stonewalling came as a photo emerged 
of Mr Burley’s fiancée, Jodie Jones standing next to a man dressed in a 
German uniform. Ms Jones has been chair of the Cannock Chase 
Conservative Association, which offered the MP its full backing last 
Monday.

Last week, Miss Jones was seen in the House of Commons with Mr Burley. When approached, the  couple declined to comment.

The photo came as Stephen Pollard, 
editor of The Jewish Chronicle, criticised the Tories’ handling of the 
case as ‘so bizarre it raises even more serious questions than what 
happened at the stag do’.

Mr
 Pollard pointed out that Lord Gold, author of the party’s inquiry, 
failed to look at evidence compiled by the MoS: ‘He appears simply to 
have taken Mr Burley’s word for it.’

Critics have blasted Lord Gold, (right) author of the party's inquiry, for not consulting The Mail on Sunday's findings including transcripts of Nazi chants as he is identified. But Grant Shapps (left) refuses to probe further

Last night, Mr Burley insisted he had told the truth to Lord Gold’s inquiry, and said he stood by his claim that Mr Fournier had given a Nazi salute at the behest of MoS reporter, Matt Sandy, and photographer, John McLellan.

Both men stress this is completely untrue.

No10 declined to comment further.

Shamed Tory MP Aidan Burley faced fresh embarrassment last night after a photograph emerged  of his fiancée standing next to a  man in what appears to be a German military uniform.

Jodie Jones – who is also the MP’s constituency office manager – can be seen wearing a Catwoman mask and low-cut top, flanked by a man apparently dressed as a German  soldier and another in Middle Eastern dress.

Other photographs show her as a St Trinian’s schoolgirl draped provocatively over a pool table and in a second kissing a female friend.

They emerged as it was revealed that Miss Jones once chaired the association which gave her fiancé its full backing after he was exposed as a liar by The Mail on Sunday.

On Monday, Cannock Chase Conservative Association issued a  statement in favour of Mr Burley – without attempting to explain the glaring inconsistencies in his account surrounding a Nazi-themed stag do he attended in 2011.

But there was confusion last  night as to the role 25-year-old Tory councillor Miss Jones played in the decision. She insisted to The Mail on Sunday that she had resigned ‘prior to the meeting’ and had had no part in the final outcome.

However, she declined to say why she had resigned from her post.

At the same time, neither she nor Mr Burley corrected a local newspaper report on Thursday, three days after the meeting, naming her as chairman of the Cannock Chase Conservative Association.

Last night, other sources in the Association said Miss Jones was still the chairman – and that they were unaware she had resigned.

Chris Anslow, a Cannock Chase district councillor, confirmed she was still the chairman. ‘At the moment, it’s Jodie Jones,’ he said.

However, he revealed that was about to change at the association’s annual general meeting later this month. ‘It’s just in the process (of changing),’ he said.

Ms Jones said that the photograph  of her as Catwoman had been taken at a party in Western Australia in 2009, and that she did not know either of the men. The pictures were among those Miss Jones allowed to be released to the media two years ago when she was billed ‘Britain’s sexiest councillor’.

Many of them appear to have  been taken when she was a politics and history student at Magdalen College, Oxford.

In one, she is seen vampishly dressed and kissing a female friend, while in another she is pictured in a bikini at a ‘beach party’ with a male companion. Elsewhere, she is photographed after her final exams sitting on the ground, swigging from two bottles of wine. 

In something of a contrast, she is then seen more sombrely attired, meeting David Cameron, with Mr Burley at her side.

References to the war or Germany are especially sensitive around  Cannock Chase because the area  is the site of the biggest single cemetery for German and Austrian POWs, and civilian internees from both world wars. 

The 5,000 or so graves are maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.

In an email yesterday, Miss Jones said: ‘I formally resigned as Chairman of Cannock Chase Conservative Association, in writing to the Association President, prior to last week’s meeting. The meeting was called without my involvement, I did not attend the meeting.

‘I have had no other contact with the 
Association Executive in the  last week, and had no sight of the 
Association’s statement before it was released. There was therefore no 
conflict of interest at all.’

The Association’s statement said: ‘Senior Councillors and members of the Cannock Chase Conservative Association have given their full backing to local MP, Aidan Burley, following a meeting held on Monday 27 January, at which recent allegations were discussed.

‘At the meeting, Aidan made it clear that he had told the whole truth in every aspect to the internal Conservative Party inquiry conducted by Lord Gold.’

The statement also carried  supportive comments from members of the community, including former heavyweight boxer turned entrepreneur, Scott Murray.

He said: ‘Aidan… made a mistake two years ago, has apologised and paid the price.’

Miss Jones first arrived in Cannock soon after graduating from Oxford in 2009. She became a councillor in 2011, aged only 22.

At the time, she said in an interview: ‘I’ve have always been quite opinionated, and this [being a councillor] gives me a chance to have a say on the things that are important to me.

‘I don’t have any time for a boyfriend – I will probably be able to one day, but for now I have enough responsibilities with my job.

‘It gives me a chance to make sure things get done.

‘I definitely see myself in Parliament one day, and who knows  what might happen, I won’t rule anything out – I could be Prime Minister one day.’

Last year, following Mr Burley’s split from TV fashion presenter and stylist Helen Boyle, 34 Miss Jones emerged as his new consort and fiancée.
