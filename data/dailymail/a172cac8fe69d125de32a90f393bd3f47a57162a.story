Two minutes after the Queen arrived at Windsor Guildhall this man was arrested on suspicion of shoplifting just yards away by armed officers

A man has been arrested just yards away from the Queen during Black Friday on suspicion of shoplifting.

The unnamed man was bundled into a police car by armed protection officers who were on duty protecting Her Majesty as she unveiled two stained glass windows.

The Duke of Edinburgh joined her in the Ascot Room where the windows, which commemorate her Jubilee, are housed.

Elsewhere a male shopper was arrested at an Asda store during the Black Friday scramble for cut-price goods which has seen bargain hunters behaving 'like savages'.

These extraordinary pictures show the man being tackled and then wrestled to the ground 
by security guards at the store in Cribbs Causeway, Bristol.

He was arrested following a row over two 60-inch televisions as thousands of people across the country bombarded stores selling discounted DVD players, phones and tablets.

Eyewitnesses said trouble flared up when staff told the man, 35, was only allowed to buy one of each product.

He was escorted from the store by security guards and was finally restrained by five members of staff - with one employee suffering a cut face.

One witness said: 'He was being told by staff at Asda that he wasn't allowed to buy two TVs.

'Security then escorted him and he was arguing and filming them on his mobile phone when it was knocked out of his hand.

'He ended up being carted off handcuffed in a police car but it was the security guards who got physical.'

According to one witness, there was an 
orderly queue outside the store - where tablets were on sale for just 
£49 - from around 6am this morning. 

But when the clocks stuck 8am - chaos descended.

Shoppers were frantically snatching products from the shelves with men and women piling into each other in a mad scramble to snatch bargains.

A shopper described scenes at the store as 'horrific' and said shoppers were like 'a pack of savages looking for a bargain.'

Margaret Green, 55, from North Tyneside, said: 'It was bedlam, chaos. It 
was absolutely jam-packed. It wasn't a great queuing system. People 
started taking the black sheets off themselves, then in was mayhem.

'People grabbed what they could. There was no ticketing system.

Mad dash: Shoppers enjoyed up to 70 per cent discounts of electrical items - such as televisions, tablets and phones. Many filled their trolleys with the cut-price goods

Good buy: Tablets were selling for just £49 and Samsung phones for £99 at the event

'They did have staff at the 32 inch TVs but I didn't see any staff where the tablets and the phones were.

'There were big fights at the tablets and the phones. It was horrific. It was like a pack of savages looking for a bargain.

'I
 was ashamed to be English to be honest. People had more than one item. 
They had two or three TVs or tablets in their trollies.

Elsewhere: Meanwhile, at Asda in Leyton, East London shoppers were also enjoying cut-price bargains

Queues at the checkout: Electrical items were gone within 2 minutes at the Leyton event - originally an American tradition to encourage Christmas spending

'I saw one person take a phone out of 
somebody else's basket. There was lots of screaming and shouting. I'm 
surprised there weren't people on the floor. I found it disgusting. It 
was horrific.'

One shopper filled his trolley with 
two 32inch flat screen TV's that were only £99 before abandoning his bounty in search 
of other slashed-price items.

Another witness said: 'They were like locusts - shoppers were coming in from everywhere.

Deserted: Black Friday fever has clearly not reached the Victoria Quarter in Leeds - which was virtually shopper-free this morning

Not good for business: The brand-new Trinity centre in the city was also quiet this morning

However, some locations had not been hit with Black Friday fever - with several shopping areas in Leeds completely deserted.

Black Friday - the biggest day in 
America’s festive shopping calendar - has well and truly arrived in the
 UK to kick off the pre-Christmas rush.

With discounts of up to 70 per cent on 
everything from flatscreen TVs to party shoes, it is hoped the discount 
day will get shoppers in the mood to spend.

Bargains: There will be huge discounts available in numerous British stores today - some pictured

Snap them up! John Lewis, House of Fraser and Asos.com are among the brands cutting their prices

The event has crept across the Atlantic over the past few years as U.S. giants such as Amazon and Apple have sought to include the UK in the shopping frenzy.

This year British stores such as John Lewis and Debenhams have joined in - slashing their prices for one day only.

Sofa Sunday has taken over from Cyber
 Monday as the most popular day for online Christmas shopping in 
Britain, according to a new report.

Leading retailers say this year Sunday will be the busiest day for online orders.

The first Monday of December was previously the most hectic day on the Internet.

It is predicted that £4.4billion will be spent by an estimated 30 million shoppers this weekend alone.

This weekend, workers will also have received their last monthly salary before Christmas.

Almost
 50per cent of browsing will be between 7pm - 11pm, while we watch 
peak-time TV in a new trend known as 'second screening', according to 
online lifestyle site Notonthehighstreet. 

Previously
 Internet shoppers would compile their chosen list of gifts over the 
weekend and place orders on their desk computers when they got to work 
on Monday, their report suggests.

Holly
 Tucker, chief executive of Notonthestreet.com said yesterday: 'Monday 
has always been our busiest day, with typically 30% more browsers than 
on a Sunday, but, in the pre-Christmas build up we've seen 25% more 
Sunday shoppers than on a Monday - for the first time ever.

'Our
 analysts are predicting that this Sunday will again top Monday in the 
rush to buy gifts following the last pay day before Christmas.It appears
 this year's Christmas shopping is being done from the sofa in front of 
the telly.'

High Street chain Debenhams backed the findings. Spokesperson Elena Antoniou said: 'Sundays are now our busiest day online.

'With
 many people receiving their last pay packet before Christmas this 
weekend we are expecting to see them to start their festive shopping in 
earnest. Online shoppers were once stuck in the spare room on a desk 
top, now they shop online from the sofa with tablets, smartphones and 
laptops, while still keeping an eye on the TV.'

Preparations: Employees select and dispatch items in the huge Amazon 'fulfilment centre' warehouse in Peterborough

Industry
 observers say that habits have changed because of the phenomenal growth
 in the use of handheld tablets and smart phone to order goods from 
Internet sites.

Last Cyber Monday  - December 3 2012 - 
Amazon said they saw more than 3.5 million items ordered on their website, at a 
rate of around 41 items per second.

That meant that a delivery lorry packed 
with Cyber Monday orders left one of Amazon's eight UK fulfilment 
centres every two minutes and 10 seconds.

In preparation, Amazon.co.uk is hiring more than 15,000 
people across the UK for seasonal positions in its fulfilment and 
customer service centres this Christmas period.

The online retailer predict the Kindle will be the best-selling item this festive period, with other favourites including the PlayStation 4 and the Game of Thrones box set.
