A restaurant owner has been left stumped after his local council threatened to fine him for not holding an advertising permit, despite the local authority failing to issue them or direct him to somewhere that does.

Bill Cobb, who owns Billy's On The Bay in Margate, 26km north of Brisbane, told Daily Mail Australia that he had been attaching a sign to the tow bar of his car for the last seven and a half years.

'The sign slides into my tow bar, only when I'm at work, and has an arrow pointing to the restaurant,'

Bill Cobb was advised by his local council to remove the pictured sign or risk receiving a fine due to not holding a permit. However the council said they did not issue permits or direct him to somewhere that did

'I'm under a motel so you could drive right past without even noticing me.'

Despite the fact that Mr Cobb has been displaying the sign since June 10 in 2008, he said he was approached by a ranger from the Moreton Bay Regional Council who told him he had to take it down.

'We're at a dead end,'a confused Mr Cobb, who had been displaying the sign since June 10 in 2008, said

'She said: "If you don't take it off I'm going to have to give you a warning and you'll get a fine",' Mr Cobb said.

'She said it's against the law and I need a permit for the sign, but they don't issue permits.'

Mr Cobb then contacted the Main Roads Department and the local police about where he could obtain a permit for the ad, both of which referred him back to his local council.

'They said it's up to council because it's their local area, but they won't issue a permit. So, we're at a dead end,' he said.

The business owner has since been forced to remove the sign permanently as the fines range between $227 and $2260.

A Moreton Bay Regional Council spokesman told Daily Mail Australia the signage did not comply with council’s local laws for advertising signage or the Queensland Government’s Transport Operations (Road Use Management) Act.

'The Transport Operations (Road Use Management) Act states road corridors cannot be used for the purposes of advertising without a permit’ the spokesperson said quoting a legislation which added: ‘unless the person is the holder of a permit issued by the chief executive or commissioner authorising the person so to do'.

When asked by Daily Mail Australia whom the chief executive or commissioner issuing permits was or where a resident could find them to apply for a permit, the spokesperson was unable to give a response.

He repeated that the sign did not comply with council laws and that a permit would not be issued.

A Moreton Bay Regional Council spokesperson, which looks after the area of Margate where Mr Cobb's restaurant is based, said the sign would not be given a permit because it doesn't comply with council laws
