Five British troops, including personnel from Prince Harry’s former Army unit, have been killed in the UK’s worst helicopter crash in Afghanistan.

The tragedy happened when the Lynx helicopter, believed to be on a reconnaissance mission, came down in a mountainous Taliban stronghold close to the Pakistan border.

Soon after the crash at 11am local time, Taliban insurgents claimed they had shot the helicopter down with a rocket.

The Lynx helicopter and crew were believed to have been based at Kandahar airfield. The crash occurred near the Pakistan border at 11am local time

But military sources told The Mail on Sunday that the British-made helicopter, which has an excellent safety record, suffered a catastrophic technical failure and that no enemy action was involved.

Those killed are thought to be two passengers and three crew members from the Army Air Corps, the unit Prince Harry belonged to when he flew Apache helicopter gunships in Afghanistan last year.

Last night Royal sources said the Prince was deeply concerned to hear of the incident.

Lynx helicopters are flown exclusively by the Army Air Corps but with some Royal Navy and Royal Air Force personnel on attachment.

The Ministry of Defence said last night that it had completed a provisional identification of those who died. There was speculation last night that some of those on board may have been special forces.

It is the first time British helicopter crew have been killed in more than a decade of flying in Afghanistan, and comes just months before all combat troops on the Nato-led mission pull out of the country.

The crash brings the total number of UK personnel lost in Afghanistan to 453. It was the most deadly air incident involving UK forces since 14 personnel were killed when an RAF Nimrod crashed in 2006.

Last night the families of those who lost their lives were being informed by MoD welfare officers.

Meanwhile, in Afghanistan the crash site was sealed off by troops as an investigation got under way into the circumstances behind the tragedy.

The MoD said: ‘We can confirm that a UK helicopter crashed in southern Afghanistan. The incident is under investigation and it would be inappropriate to comment until families have been notified.’

A spokesman for the Nato operation, known as the International Security Assistance Force, added: ‘Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends affected by this tragic event.’

The helicopter crashed near a village in the Takhta Pul district, near Kandahar city in south-east of Afghanistan, and only a few minutes’ flying time from the helicopter’s base.

There were no reports of enemy activity in the area of deserts and mountains, which is outside Britain’s main theatre of war in Helmand.

But Kandahar remains volatile and one Taliban spokesman claimed in a text message to local journalists that the ‘mujahedeen’ had brought the helicopter down with a rocket launcher.

Insurgents also wrote online that the ‘wreckage caught fire as it smashed on to the ground, killing all invaders onboard’.

But local officials insisted the crash had been a tragic accident. Zia Durrani, the provincial police spokesman, said: ‘A helicopter belonging to Nato troops has crashed. It was doing military exercises and crashed as a result of technical fault.’

A spokesman for Kandahar’s governor also said the ‘helicopter crashed due to technical problems’.

An inquiry will be carried out by the Military Aviation Authority to establish the cause of the crash.

The Lynx helicopter and her crew were believed to have been based at Kandahar airfield. The base is home to 657 Squadron Army Air Corps, which flies the Lynx in an escort role protecting transport helicopters such as the Chinook and Sea King which are more vulnerable to attack from Taliban gunmen.

There are 2,000 serving personnel with Army Air Corps, including  specialists from the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers who repair helicopter, and officers, such as Prince Harry, who are attached from their own regiment – in his case the Household Cavalry. 657 Squadron, belongs to 7 Special Forces Group, a unit supporting the SAS and SBS.

Lynx helicopters, made by Westland in Yeovil, are the world’s fastest and can reach speeds of 185mph.

A decade ago four Royal Navy servicemen died when a Lynx ditched into the sea off Cornwall. And in May 2006 five UK personnel were killed when a Lynx helicopter crashed in Basra, southern Iraq, after it was struck by a surface-to-air missiles fired by insurgents.

Following the crash, a board of inquiry made key safety recommendations that were never made public for security reasons.

But until yesterday no British troops had been killed in helicopter crashes in Afghanistan.

In three earlier Chinook crashes and an Apache emergency landing, all those aboard survived.

In December six US soldiers were 
killed when their Black Hawk crashed in Zabul, while 30 US troops and 
eight Afghans died when their Chinook was shot down in 2011.

About 5,200 British troops remain in Afghanistan, out of a total Nato force of 51,000. All combat troops are due to withdraw by December. Above: Camp Bastion

Richard Kemp, former commander of British troops told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It is obviously a tragic incident and it reminds us that operating in places like Afghanistan our soldiers face enormous risks, even if they’re not fighting the Taliban.

Sometimes they have to fly helicopters in conditions that no civilian would, such as evacuating casualties or delivering supplies.

‘I would certainly pay tribute to the bravery of anybody who is prepared to put their life on the line like that.’

He said in hostile territory helicopter pilots often had to fly at great speed or close to the ground, often hampered by dust storms.
