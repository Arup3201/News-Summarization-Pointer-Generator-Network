A mother who suffocated her three disabled children before trying to kill herself was yesterday told she will not face trial for their murder.

In the wake of the killings, Tania Clarence left a note for her husband, a wealthy banker, which read: ‘Gary, I don’t want to be saved please. I can’t live with the horror of what I have done.’

Prosecutors have now accepted that the 42-year-old was overwhelmed by depression when she killed her four-year-old daughter Olivia and three-year-old twins Ben and Max, and wanted ‘a way out of their joint suffering’.

No trial: Tania Clarence, has admitted killing her twins three-year-old sons Max and Ben (pictured with father Gary) and their older sister Olivia, four, but will not face a murder trial , a judge said today

She has pleaded guilty to their manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Now having psychiatric treatment, Clarence is said to ‘bitterly regret’ her children’s deaths.

Although his wife did not appear in court, Mr Clarence, 43, a director with City bank Investec, attended the short hearing, but made no comment.

Clarence, 42, (who attended an earlier court hearing under the cover of a coat, above) had killed her children 'to end their suffering', the prosecution said today

A neighbour said yesterday that Mr Clarence was supporting his wife in hospital, adding: ‘They are still very fond of each other. He told a neighbour they loved each other to pieces.’

Another neighbour said Mr Clarence visited his wife every day.

Accepting the mother’s plea, the Crown Prosecution Service agreed that Clarence was ‘unable to form a rational judgment’ at the time of the killings.

Bereft: Her husband Gary Clarence (pictured at the Old Bailey today) was in South Africa with the couple's eldest child when the deaths occurred

Prosecutor Zoe Johnson QC told the Old Bailey: ‘Although the term “mercy killing” has no legal or psychiatric definition, it is clear Mrs Clarence killed her three children because she wanted to end their suffering.

‘At the time she committed the act she could not see any alternative or any other way out of their joint suffering – both her suffering and the suffering of her children.’

All three children had type 2 spinal muscular atrophy, a degenerative muscle-wasting condition, which usually leaves sufferers unable to stand or walk unaided.

It does not affect the mind, meaning children of normal intelligence are trapped in weak bodies and face progressive loss of control over movement and mobility.

Most sufferers live into their teenage years or adulthood, according to charities.

Olivia was diagnosed with the condition while Clarence was pregnant with the twins, who were then diagnosed after birth.

Clarence, who is originally from South Africa, gave up her job as a graphic designer to care for the children, and the family spent around £1million on their £2million home in New Malden, south-west London, equipping it with a lift and ramps.

Neighbour Joy Devis, 87, said they had seemed ‘a very happy little family’, despite the children’s disabilities.

At the time of the killings, Mr Clarence was in South Africa visiting relatives with the couple’s eldest child, now eight, who does not suffer from the condition.

After the children’s nanny and a neighbour became concerned when they didn’t see any activity at the five-bedroom home, they found Clarence weeping and bleeding from her wrist in an upstairs bedroom.

She had left a series of notes in the house, including one in Afrikaans warning her husband not to allow their daughter into the children’s bedrooms, where their bodies were found. 

Police were called and she immediately confessed to the killings, telling an officer: ‘I’m sorry. I’m sorry ... I killed them. I suffocated them.’

Clarence’s lawyer Jim Sturman QC told the court: ‘This is a truly tragic case. Anybody who reads the evidence cannot fail to be moved.

‘This offending did occur while Mrs Clarence was suffering from an abnormality of the mind.

‘She was manifesting stress throughout the life of the children with the pain they were suffering.

‘Caring for three children in that condition was exhausting, distressing, debilitating and turned out to be overwhelming, and Mrs Clarence couldn’t see any hope for the future and any way of continuing.

‘Now she bitterly regrets her actions, the deaths of the three children and the impact upon her surviving daughter, who is cared for by Mr Clarence.’

Clarence is due to be sentenced next month. 

Admission: Clarence, pictured in a prison van, confessed to the triple killing to a female police officer at the scene, saying: 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry.' Asked why she was sorry, she said: 'I killed them. I suffocated them'

The bodies of the children were found at the couple's £2million family home (above) in New Malden, south-west London, on April 22. All three were in their pyjamas in bed and are believed to have been smothered to death
