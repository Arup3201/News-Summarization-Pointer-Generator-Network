He is one of the world's fattest cats, tipping the scales at a whopping 10kg - more than 1.5 stone. 

But the aptly named Maximus is extremely agile and can jump and leap like any kitten, according to his owners.

Leon and Eugenia Korovin from Petrozavodsk, north-western Russia, bought the feline as a wedding present to each other in 2009.

'We both love cats and we both love really big cats,' said Mrs Korovin.

'So when we found Max we had to have him.

'He's big but he's extremely agile. With us he's very gentle. He can jump and leap like any kitten and he's a terror when he's after a mouse.' 

The five-years-old cross between a Maine Coon and Siberian cat keeps fit by going on daily walks.

But Mr Korovin said: 'The trouble is we couldn't find a cat harness to fit him. He kept bursting out of them so we switched to dog harnesses instead.'

And of Max's appetite is every bit as big as the rest of him.

Mrs Korovin said: 'Oh, he eats us into the poorhouse and turns his nose up at anything that isn't fresh but we think he is worth it.'
