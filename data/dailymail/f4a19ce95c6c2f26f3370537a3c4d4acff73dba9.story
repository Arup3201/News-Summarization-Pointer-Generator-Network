A father almost died of a heart attack while chasing his son after the thief stole £20 from him, a court heard.  

Joseph Newton, 23, stole the cash from his father Derek Newton, 62, while on bail for burgling his flat in Ipswich, Suffolk, just two weeks earlier.

Derek Newton had a history of serious heart problems and had to be airlifted to hospital as he fought for life after collapsing as he pursued his son.

He had to have emergency treatment at Norfolk and Norwich Hospital following the drama on the afternoon of August 17.

He has since been allowed to go home after his ordeal, a court heard.

Newton, who has been jailed for 20 months, was 'sorry' for his actions, Ipswich Crown Court was told.

Mr Newton was found by his horrified daughter slumped in his back garden after being struck down by a suspected cardiac arrest.

Just 16 days before the theft, Newton had broken in to his father's home in the early hours and stolen £20.

He went to see his frail father on August 17 and was told to go away.

Newton appeared to be very upset but returned in the next 30 minutes.

He then ran out with a £20 note.

His father chased him for a couple of minutes shouting 'come back, come back' before collapsing, the court heard.

Newton was jailed for 16 months for the burglary and given a consecutive four-month sentence for theft.

The repeat offender admitted burglary and theft at an earlier hearing at the town's magistrates' court.

Newton, of no fixed address, told the crown court: 'The last words I said to the magistrates' court were "could you tell my dad I'm sorry"'.

He had feared his father was dying and was desperate to see him, the court heard.

Newton had a difficult relationship with his father, the court heard. 

His defence lawyer, Lynne Shirley, said: 'He is remorseful.

'He has pleaded guilty.

'He has saved his father and his sister the difficult ordeal of giving evidence in a trial.

'He's very upset and obviously concerned about his father.

'It was certainly not his intention for him to come to any harm.'

She added: 'He says "I wish I could have contact with my dad. I wish I could say sorry".

'He is a young man not without hope.

'He wants to join the army and that's what he was going through the process of before these offences were committed.'
