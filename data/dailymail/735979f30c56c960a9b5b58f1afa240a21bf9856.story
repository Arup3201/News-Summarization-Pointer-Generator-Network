Theo Walcott has warned Premier League defences that Arsenal’s speed demons are ready to run riot this season.

Despite having spent nine months on the sidelines with a serious knee injury, Walcott insists he will be faster than ever when he makes his long-awaited return in the next few weeks. 

And with the added pace of summer signings Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck, the England international feels the Gunners now have the speediest attack in England.

Catch me if you can: Theo Walcott has warned Premier League defences Arsenal’s speed is as high as ever

Racing ahead: Danny Welbeck, the England international, has added to Arsenal's quick-fire front line

Outpaced: Summer signings Alexis Sanchez has given Arsenal even more speed up top at the Emirates

‘I hope we’ll have the fastest forward line in the Premier League, these are exciting times,’ said the 25-year-old. ‘These players are very, very fast, they will fit the bill perfectly. Alexis has settled in very quickly, Danny is a good guy I have worked with him with England. 

'He always puts his heart on the line. At times I thought he needed to be a bit more selfish so I was very happy on Monday night (when he scored two goals for England) — he will get more goals now.’

Walcott is now just a matter of weeks away from returning to full fitness after rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee against Tottenham on January 4. And he has vowed to recapture his title as fastest player at the club after revealing that rookie right back Hector Bellerin recently took his crown.

‘I hope to be quicker, definitely,’ said Walcott, speaking at Sportwaves — a charity exhibition and auction for national charity, Willow. ‘I’ve been working very hard. You’ve got to look at these injuries as a bit of a blessing at times.

‘Am I still fastest at the club? That’s the one thing I have not tested yet. That’s the last thing I will do once I’m match-fit.

‘I’ve never had the opportunity to work on the strength in my legs and with that I think hopefully I should be quicker and stronger. So that’s what I’m looking forward to.

‘I haven’t actually put a date on when I’ll return. It’s weeks rather than months now. My legs have bulked up.’
