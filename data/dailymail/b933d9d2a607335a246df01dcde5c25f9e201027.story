A marital arts instructors has claimed he stabbed his new wife and teenage son to death in self-defense.

William Medei, 56, knifed Renee Bader 30 times, and her son, Joshua, was found with over fifty stab wounds after the attack in their Florida mobile home in 2009.

Yesterday he appeared in court on two counts of second-degree murder, admitting he carried out the killings in a 'blind rage.'

Taking the stand: William Medei, 56, knifed Renee Bader 30 times, and her son, Joshua, was found with over fifty stab wounds after the attack in their Florida mobile home

He said he was was asleep at their home in Okomo Park mobile home on Loop Road when he awoke after hearing their pet dog whining, reported Sun Sentinel.

He recalled that was when he saw his new wife, Renee, who he had married a month before, standing over him with a 14-inch knife.

He told the court he reacted on an impulse and grabbed the knife from his 42-year-old partner, who he said was jealous and wanted a divorce.

'I didn't have time to think,'he said.

'I don't even know who it is that's doing this. I twist the hands. The knife fell in the doorwayâ€¦I was choking her. I was choking her bad.'

In action: William Medai in the ring at a fight

Medei said that was when Joshua,  his wife's son emerged and attacked from behind.

In a scuffle he said the couple fell onto the mattresses in the bedroom.

He said that was when Joshua went to grab the knife which was on the floor, but Medei explained that he managed to pick it up.

During the hearing the prosecutor warned Medei that he had just admitted to disarming both victims before killing them.

But Medei responded, 'Look at the victims. There had to be rage there.'

He pointed at photos of the crime scene which showed the bloodied victims bodies.

When his defense lawyer asked him if he was worried for his life, he replied 'Definitely.'

He told the court he was rendered 'temporarily insane' during the stabbings, but has not presented a  mental health defense.

Medei gave his testimony as part of an pre-trial motion to get the charges dismissed under the state's Stand Your Ground law.

The law means that a person may justifiably use force in self-defense when there is reasonable belief of a unlawful threat.
