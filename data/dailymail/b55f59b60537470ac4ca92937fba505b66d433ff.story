Comedy superstar Michael McIntyre walked off stage during a sold-out show because a member of the audience on the front row kept using her phone, it has emerged.

An angry McIntrye asked security to 'sort it out' and promised the audience at Darlington's Civic Theatre he would be back, before he left the stage at last night's performance.

According to the Northern Echo newspaper, some fans chanted for the woman to be thrown out and security staff spoke to her.

Soon after the comedian, 38, carried on his act, in which he previewed material for his 2015 tour.

People on Twitter apologised to the comedian after the show.

Michael McIntyre, aged 17, and his father Ray Cameron in London in 1993, six months before his  suicide

This weekend the comedian said he was ‘heartbroken’ after his step-mother revealed his father committed suicide.

The comedian said he disapproved of disclosing the ‘painful and personal’ information, which has been kept secret for more than 20 years.

McIntyre was brought up believing his father Cameron had died of a heart attack, and only discovered that he had killed himself four years ago.

His father, who was also a comedian and worked for four years on the Kenny Everett Show, suffered from depression after a downturn in his career.

The BBC paid McIntyre about £500,000 to present his six-part chat show

He shot himself in the utility room of a Hollywood apartment block in 1993, aged 55.

His widow Holly, now 58, decided to shield the truth from McIntyre, who was only 17 at the time, and his 15-year-old sister Lucy.

But yesterday, she revealed that she was forced to tell her two step-children the truth in 2010 after McIntyre was invited to take part in a BBC series probing his background. She feared his death certificate would be found, revealing the real cause of death.

McIntyre is one of the highest-grossing comics in the world and last year paid £2.5 million for a six-bedroom house in the Wiltshire countryside.

The comedian turned BBC1 chat show host pocketed more than £9million for his 73-date Showtime tour, which included ten nights at London’s O2 Arena in 2012

It is a far cry from his plight a decade ago, when he was £40,000 in debt and struggling on the stand-up circuit.

Dame Helen Mirren (circled) once stormed off stage to shout at a drumming group that was disturbing her play at the Gielgud Theatre in London

McIntyre is just the latest performer to have a show brought to a halt by a phone.

Oscar-winner Kevin Spacey had to reprimand a member of the audience when their phone rang out during a one-man show at London's Old Vic in June.

He had to halt the legal drama Clarence Darrow to call out: 'If you don't answer that, I will!' He received a round of applause.

Hugh Jackman and Daniel Craig's unflappable reaction to a phone call spoiling their Broadway show A Steady Rain in 2009 became an internet sensation.

'Don't be embarrassed, just grab the phone,' Jackman urged at one point.

Dame Helen Mirren once stormed off stage to shout at a drumming group that was disturbing her play at the Gielgud Theatre in London in May last year.

After the incident the actress saw the funny side and helped promote the drummers' event

Some witnesses said the 69-year-old star told the group to ‘shut the **** up’. Others said she ‘stomped out and shrieked “Quiet! I’m trying to do a play in here!”'

She was angry they had disturbed the first half of her play with their drumming, designed to promote gay and transgender festival As One In The Park.

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, she said something 'had to be done' as the noise had been getting louder and she and fellow actor Paul Ritter could barely hear each other speak.

She was playing the Queen in The Audience, a play about the monarch’s private weekly meetings with various prime ministers at Buckingham Palace.
