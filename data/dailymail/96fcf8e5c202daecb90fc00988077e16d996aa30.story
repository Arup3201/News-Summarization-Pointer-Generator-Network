Mary Evans, who was last night stabbed to death in Luton. Her brother-in-law has been arrested for her murder

The new brother-in-law of a 70-year-old woman who was stabbed to death in her car just yards from her home appeared before magistrates today charged with the murder.

John Evans, 56, of Trent Road, Luton, was
arrested on Monday afternoon following the incident, which took place 
on the same street.

Mary Evans, who married the accused man's brother just six weeks ago, 
was attacked on the way to pick up her grandson from school in her red Vauxhall.

He was remanded in custody by Luton Magistrates to appear at Luton Crown Court on a date to be fixed.

On Monday Neighbours heard shouting and raced outside to see a man with a blade and her slumped at the wheel of her crashed car.

Two of them brought the knifeman to the ground while others tried to save Mrs Evans’s life.

She was pronounced dead by paramedics and police who had raced to her bungalow, which is close to her brother-in-law's home.

Friends said Mrs Evans, a retired cashier known as May, had found happiness with her husband David, who she had lived next door to for 20 years.

Neighbours said that May had previously been married for more than 30 years to John Olloman, who died six years ago from cancer.

The couple had a daughter, Yvette, whose child Mrs Evans had been going to collect, and a son, Mark, who suffered from spina bifida and died around 10 years ago.

Murdered pensioner May Evans' relationship with her new husband had developed from a mere friendship, according to a neighbour.

She said Mrs Evans had first known her husband as a neighbour, as their bungalows backed onto one another across a garden.

'They had been seeing each other for a couple of years,' he said.

'She kept it relatively quiet, I think they were good friends and it developed from that, after Olly died.'

Mrs Evans, who was a volunteer at the local hospital, was described by her younger sister as a very caring person.

Shirley Vincent told ITV Anglia: ‘She 
was my big sister and she liked to be called the matriarch of the 
family, being the eldest.

'She
could be quite odd – but she didn’t like to think she was an old lady, 
she was 70. She lived for her daughter and her grandson. She was there 
for everybody.’

A neighbour said: 'May was really happy after a long time. She had a
disabled son who passed away and her husband had some problems and he 
died too. She had a daughter and grandchild and she always helped out.

'She
was a big inspiration as a person of her age looking after so many 
people.I feel sad. Nobody deserves to be treated like that.

'She has suffered all her life. Where is the justice? That she has been treated like that, really upsets me.'

This morning one resident described the scene: 'I came out and saw the paramedics were attending to the woman driver. At first I thought she had just lost control of the car and crashed into a fence.'

During the course of the morning, bunches of flowers and a teddy bear and card were left at the scene.

Mrs Evans' family visited the floral tributes, but were too upset to talk.

Detective Chief Inspector Jonathan Hutchinson, investigating, is still keen to speak with anyone who has information relating to the incident.

He said: 'Although a person has been charged in relation to this incident I would urge anyone who may have witnessed the events in Trent Road to come forward and speak with us.

'You may have already dismissed this information as insignificant or thought that the arrest and charge of a person made it less important to us.

'Please don’t assume that someone else has told us, or that we already know. Please come forward if you were in the area so that we have the fullest picture possible to help us complete this enquiry.'

Anyone with information relating to this crime can contact the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, in confidence, on 101 or text information to 07786 200011.

Alternatively you can contact the independent crime fighting charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
