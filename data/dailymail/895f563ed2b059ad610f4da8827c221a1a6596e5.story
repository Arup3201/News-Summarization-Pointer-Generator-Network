Project Runway’s Tim Gunn says that he is still afraid of Anna Wintour after revealing that she was once carried down a flight of stairs because she refused to use a public elevator.

Mr Gunn, 60, told the New York Post: ‘I don’t look into her eyes, because I will be turned into stone.’

The anecdote was published in the fashion expert's 2010 book, Gunn's Golden Rules.

Speaking out: Tim Gunn (left) says that he is too afraid to look at Anna Wintour (right) in the eyes, following a passage from his 2010 book that sent the Vogue offices into PR-crisis mode

He says he witnessed the U.S. Vogue 
editor-in-chief being carried down stairs by her bodyguards in a 
fireman's lock after a Peter Som show at the Metropolitan Pavilion in 
New York's Chelsea.

The reason, he explained, was because she did not want to take a public elevator.

He
 wrote: ‘We ran over to [an] elevator bay to see if Anna would deign to 
get on. Then…what did we see but Anna being carried down the 
stairs…bodyguards had made a fireman’s lock and they were racing her 
from landing to landing.

'All hell broke loose...her office was insisting I print a retraction'

‘They carried her to the car,’ he added.

Mr Gunn told the Post last week that the publication of this anecdote in his book sent Vogue into PR-crisis mode.

‘All hell broke loose…her office was insisting I print a retraction,’ he told the paper.

In
 an effort to defend himself, Mr Gunn found more witnesses, he says, to 
call Vogue and report that they had also seen Ms Wintour being carried 
down the stairs.

‘I wasn’t 
maligning her character. I was simply making a statement of facts,' he 
said. 'It didn’t say anything about her as a person…the cause celebre 
here was speed.'

Mr Gunn was
 chair of fashion design at Parsons The New School For Design before 
finding TV fame. He has been a mentor on Heidi Klum's Project Runway 
since 2006 and now fronts a spin-off show, Under the Gunn.
