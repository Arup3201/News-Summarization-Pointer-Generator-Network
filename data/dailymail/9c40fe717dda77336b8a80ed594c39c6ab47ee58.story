RV owner Rabbi Steve Blumberg has said that Upper West Side residents really ought to take life less seriously and be less concerned about his vehicle

Residents in one of New York’s most exclusive neighborhoods are up in arms after several beaten-up old RVs are reported blighting the streets.

Angry Upper West Side locals have complained that the vehicles are turning their highly desirable area into a trailer park, taking up valuable parking spaces and generally lowering the tone.

With its easy access to Central Park, the area is much sought after with some of the highest prices in the city, but now some residents are concerned that others are trying move in by stealth.

One trailer, a rusty ’84 Chevy 
Pathfinder, parked at Riverside Drive and 74th Street has been described
 by local resident Gretchen Berger, as ‘an ugly piece of junk.’

The RV belongs to Queens-born Rabbi Steve Blumberg, a Kabbalah practitioner, who told The New York Post that the residents ought to take life less seriously.

'If you want a gated community, you should live in Creedmoor [Psychiatric Center],' he said.

'Otherwise-liberal
 West Siders have very serious middle-class scruples about what should 
or should not be in their neighborhood.'

The Rabbi, 62, bought the vehicle on eBay for $8,000 in 2007 and has living in it on and off since, although he claims he is currently living rent-free in a nearby apartment.

Blumberg said he continues to use the 23-foot vehicle as a crash pad for visiting friends, or as a space to collect his thoughts, meditate and pray.

Leaving a mobile home on a city street for more than 24 hours is illegal with fines starting at $115.

Enforcement is typically complaint-driven, but Blumberg claims he has never been ticketed.

There is also a second RV which is troubling local residents, some of whom have called it a 'monster'.

The owner of the 19-foot, 1975 Dodge Sportsman with gold rims and blocked-out windows, claims that he uses it to store things in.

'It looks like it would fit more in the mountains of West Virginia than on the Upper West Side,' one local resident, Ron Hoffman, told the Post.
