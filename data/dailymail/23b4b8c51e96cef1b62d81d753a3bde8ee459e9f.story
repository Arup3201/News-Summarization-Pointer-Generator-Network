The secret 'first son' of Lucian Freud has said he felt he was being airbrushed out of family history after the artist died.

With the artist’s £96 million fortune still to be settled, Paul McAdam Freud, who is one of four children from Freud’s relationship with the artist Katherine McAdam, said he was asked to prove he is Freud’s son.

'They tried to airbrush me from his history. It was deeply offensive and hurtful,' said the 55-year-old.

Freud’s death in July 2011 started a battle for recognition and to prove he is a genuine relation as his father’s will was being processed.

Of one of his last meetings with his father, McAdam Freud told The Sunday Times: 'I did ask him at that meeting about the fact that it had been reported he had 14 acknowledged children. 

'I said, "I am acknowledged, aren’t I?" He said: "I would never, ever not acknowledge you".'

Freud met McAdam when she was studying fashion at St Martin’s School of Art in London and later moved to Roehampton, south-west London, in the late 1960s, when the pair parted.

McAdam Freud re-established contact with his father - who he physically resembled - in 1989 

'When I was 25 I used to look at the self-portraits he painted. It was like looking in the mirror,' he said.

The solicitors handling Freud’s affairs told the Times that the executors of the will had always acted in the best interests of the beneficiaries of his estate.

In July, McAdam Freud lost his bid to secure a share of the artist's fortune following a dispute in the High Court. 

McAdam Freud, brother of fashion designer Bella Freud, was fighting a clause in his father's will which meant he would inherit none of the money. He was also fighting a clause that meant only two people will ever know exactly who the artist's estate is handed to.

At the time of Freud's death three years ago, Diana Rawstrom, his trusted solicitor, and Rose Pearce, one of his daughters, were the sole beneficiaries.

After legacies and taxes the pair inherited an estimated £42million.

But they have since revealed that Freud secretly instructed them to pass on money to a list of others, without ever revealing their identities or the sums of money involved.

McAdam Freud tried to lift the lid on this secrecy by arguing that part of the will was illegitimate, but he failed in his attempt.

Freud made his fortune through his portrait work, thought by many to be the best of his generation. His most famous work, 'Benefits Supervisor Sleeping' (pictured), sold for a world-record $33.8million in 2008

If he had succeeded it would also have meant Freud would have died largely intestate, and his millions would have been handed out to his next of kin, a complicated task given that the exact number of his children is unknown - though the court heard that it was 'at least 14'.

Lucian's only legitimate offspring, two daughters named Annie and Annabel, came from his marriage to Kitty Garman - a muse of his whom he married in 1948.

However, he had another four children by  Suzy Boyt, a student he had met at the Slade school of art in the fifties, and another four, including McAdam Freud and sisters Jane, Bella and Esther, by Kathleen McAdam.

After Kathleen left him in 1966, it is said that he barely saw any of the family for 20 years.

The Greek sculptor Vassilakis Takis, a close friend of Lucian's, estimated that he had at least 500 lovers during his lifetime, while family friends insist that his children could number as high as 30.

Revealing the true beneficiaries of Freud's will could have lifted the lid on some of the mystery, but following the ruling in July, only Mrs Rawstrom and Mrs Pearce will know who receives the money. 

Freud's portraits often featured nudes of  his friends and family. This portrait is of his daughter, Bella

Speaking at the High Court, the judge said he could ‘readily understand’ McAdam Freud’s concerns about the secrecy of the will, from which he stood to gain nothing.

‘There is a lot of money involved here, so I fully understand these are important issues,’ he said, before ruling that Mrs Rawstrom’s and Mrs Pearce’s interpretation of the will made ‘common sense’.

Although, on the face of it, the will appeared to give the £42 million to Mrs Rawstrom and Mrs Pearce ‘absolutely’, they had since made clear that they held the money only as trustees and were bound to distribute the cash under a cloak of confidentiality.

‘They wish to respect the deceased’s wishes not to disclose the terms of the fully secret trust to anyone who is not a beneficiary,’ their barrister, Michael Furness QC, had earlier told the court.

The judge said it had ‘at one time been disputed’ that McAdam Freud was the artist’s son, but it had been accepted - at least for the purposes of the court hearing - that he was ‘another of Lucian Freud’s children’.

By his will, the artist specifically left a £2.5m tax-free gift and a house in west London to his assistant of more than 20 years, David Dawson.

A second clause instructed Mrs Pearce and Mrs Rawstron to dispose of ‘chattels’ on the basis of instructions given during his life.

One of Freud’s works was also given to the National Gallery in lieu of inheritance tax.
