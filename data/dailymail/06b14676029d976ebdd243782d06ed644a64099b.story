Spot the difference: Police have spent more than £50,000 on cardboard cut-outs like this one (right)

Police have spent more than £50,000 on cardboard cut-outs of themselves - despite most forces admitting they do not know if they stop crime.

The two-dimensional crime fighters are supposed to deter shoplifters and petrol thieves who think they are real PCs from a distance.

But some have become victims of crime themselves after being stolen by pranksters or vandalised.

Now MailOnline can reveal forces have bought more than 750 of the replicas - at the same time as axing more than 10,000 frontline officers.

The total was questioned by the Police Federation, which said more cash should be spent on real PCs.

The Taxpayers' Alliance campaign group added: 'This seems to be a gimmick.'

Obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the figures show almost half of Britain's police forces have invested in the cut-outs since 2008, when they first made headlines.

A total of 21 forces said £53,940 had been spent on 782 cardboard cut-outs.

Most were used for crime prevention along with a small number used as promotional materials.

The cost was borne almost entirely by police, with a small amount in some cases contributed by council-led safety partnerships.

But there were huge differences in the amount paid by each force - and therefore the value of money to the taxpayer.

One police force paid 10 times more for each cardboard policeman than another force 200 miles away.

What's all this then? The cardboard PCs are supposed to deter shoplifters - but prove confusing for some

Gwent Police spent by far the most, splashing out £13,260 on just 52 cut-outs at £255 each.

By comparison the average cost of a 
carboard crime-fighter was a much more modest £69 - and South Yorkshire 
Police paid just £25 for each of theirs.

Meanwhile, only three of the 21 forces could provide MailOnline with any figures to suggest the cut-outs stop crime.

Alongside local figures, South Yorkshire Police cited 'national research' which claimed cut-outs reduced crime by 35 per cent, but this was not quoted by any other force.

Nottinghamshire relied on informal feedback which claimed they reduced crime by up to 40 per cent, while Hertfordshire saw shoplifting drop 8.6 per cent 'as part of a wider campaign'.

1. Gwent: £13,260 for 52 cut-outs (£255 each)

2. Derbyshire: £11,280 for 112 (£100 each)

3. South Yorks: £6,000 for 240 (£25 each)

4. Norfolk: £5,330 for 52 cut-outs (£102 each)

5. Humberside: £2,745 for 48 (£57 each)

They were not universally loved, however.

Earlier this year a man who dragged one of the effigies onto a petrol station forecourt and kicked it to pieces in full view of CCTV was fined £90.

Police tracked down the 23-year-old after the bizarre attack at a Tesco petrol station in Pitsea, Essex, after tracing his car numberplate.

The incident was embarrassing for Essex Police, which reintroduced the cardboard policemen despite withdrawing a trial of them four years earlier after saying they did not reduce crime.

Campaigners have criticised the cost of the effigies, which were bought amid swingeing cuts to police forces.

In September 2008, England and Wales 
had more than 142,000 officers. Now there are fewer than 132,000, a cut 
of 7.4 per cent.

Frontline numbers are down by almost 11 per cent since 
their peak in September 2009.

Responding to the figures, Police Federation Chairman Steve White said: 'Since the 2010 general election, the police service in England and Wales has lost around 16,000 officers and the anticipated reduction in the policing budget in 2015/16 will inevitably lead to a further falls.

2008: £11,735

2009: £4,556

2010: £4,434

2011: £3,865

2012: £13,875

2013: £7,237

Year unknown: £8,237,78

'This drop in officer numbers is having a negative impact on the service that the police can deliver. We urge forces to ensure they use all the funds at their disposal to keep officer numbers as high as possible.'

Andy Silvester, campaign manager for 
the Taxpayers' Alliance, added: 'Until it's shown that these actually 
work, this seems to be a gimmick that will take money away from 
essential front-line services.

'The
 public want the thin blue line to be made of police officers, not 
cardboard. No cut-out, to my knowledge, has ever slapped handcuffs on a 
criminal.'

In Gwent Police, the cut-outs were bought from the MWL Print Group in nearby Pontypool between and 2011 and 2013, and were sent into areas with a high shoplifting rate.

The high cost was signed off by Detective Superintendent Ian Roberts and his successor DCI Richard Williams insisted the force had sought multiple quotes - but 'the chosen supplier produced a far more robust model being mounted on wood which is still in use'.

He added: 'We have had considerable success in dealing with shoplifting since the cut outs were introduced.

On the beat: Police Federation chairman Steve White said funds should be focused on frontline officers

'We have them deployed at larger stores, and garages throughout the force area. Levels of shoplifting continue to fall in Gwent. The trend began in October 2011 and, compared to our most similar Forces, Gwent experienced the second lowest level of shoplifting per 1000 residents in the past 12 months and we remain committed to using every technique available to prevent this crime.

'The replicas, which have also been introduced into other Force areas, are by no means a replacement for real police officers. They are simply another tool in the fight against crime.

'The replicas will remind potential thieves that real police officers are regularly in and around the shops as part of their normal patrols, and the initiative is another way for police and partners to work together.'

The Association of Chief Police Officers said it was up to individual forces to decide what they buy.

National policing lead for procurement Lee Tribe said: 'There are no national guidelines for the procurement of "cut-outs" of officers. This is a matter for each force and will be budgeted for on a force-by-force basis.

'Their use will be determined locally which may include such activities as publicity and recruitment.'
