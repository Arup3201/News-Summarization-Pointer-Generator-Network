 A 9-year-old girl was badly injured on Tuesday when a mule kicked her directly in the head.

The young Emma Johnson was unconscious but breathing when firefighters arrived on Green Drive near Canton in Cherokee County Atlanta, Georgia.

Emma and her mother were attempting to lure two wayward mules into their neighbor's empty pasture until they could find the mules' owner.

The mules had somehow managed to escape from their fenced-in enclosure

Emmas's neighbor Thomas Ross witnessed the unfortunate event and helped Emma's mother call 911

Emma's mother carried a bucket of feed in attempt to lead the mules and Emma followed closely behind her.

When Emma got a little too close to the back of one of the mules, it kicked her, said the girl's neighbor Thomas Ross.

'She’s 9 years old and she’s familiar with horses, but these were large mules,' said Thomas Ross to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution late Tuesday.

Ross told the girl's mother to call 911 as soon as he saw the kick.

Emma's mother dropped her phone, so Ross was the one who gave the 911 operator information about Emma and what seemed to be a serious head wound.

'She probably didn’t think a thing about it,' Ross said. 'She was running and carrying a plastic feed bucket.'

The paramedics took Emma to a church where she was airlifted via helicopter to the hospital.

Investigators are trying to discover how the mules managed to escape their enclosure. They believe rain may have washed away part of the fence which allowed the mules to escape.

The owner of the mules, Tim Byess, will not face criminal charges.

He feels badly about the injury and said, 'a mule aint worth nothin'. A life is worth everything.' 

'She’s a little jewel, she really is,' neighbor Thomas Ross said. 'I hope she pulls through.'

Tim Byess feels bad about the incident and said that a little girl's life is worth more than a mule's anyday
