A man in Florida reportedly killed his mother before going after his two young nieces Thursday morning in a brutal attack. 

Jason Rios from New Port Richey, a paranoid schizophrenic who was on drugs at the time according to one family member, is suspected of killing his mother Angela, an amputee with no legs, in their home, attacking two of his nieces with a blunt weapon and was in the process of attacking a third child when his father Ernesto came upon him, dragging the boy outside as police were called.

The girls are at St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa where 9-year-old Jenica Randazzo is in serious condition and 7-year-old La'nyla Heater is in stable condition.

After the attack he barricaded himself in his uncle's home next door, which led to a three hour standoff with a SWAT team (above)

While Rios, 23, was being held by his father, he managed to run into a nearby house belonging to an uncle and barricade himself inside according to ABC Tampa. 

This led to a three hour standoff, as a SWAT team was called in and tried to convince Rios to come outside, unsure if there were individuals in the house being held hostage.

During this time authorities also evacuated other houses in the area to ensure the safety of residents, and got the children out of the Rios home, where Mrs. Rios was pronounced dead on the scene.

When reasoning with Rios proved to be ineffective, a BearCat was used to take out one of the walls in the home and deploy tear gas and flash bang devices, at which point Rios stumbled out with one hand in his pocket.

Officers believe he may have done so in hopes of being shot dead, but not one member of the SWAT team even fired at the troubled young man. 

As he was making his way out he ran into one of the SWAT vehicles and ended up knocking himself out, and was taken from the scene on a stretcher.

Pasco Sheriff Chris Nocco called it 'a horrific situation.'

There were two other young boys, ages 13 and 4, at the home that morning, who were unharmed.

Ernesto, the grandfather to the two girls, was about to take them to school for the day.

Rios also had cuts on his neck, stomach and head that were likely self-inflected, and which cops believe he did using a drill bit.

Meanwhile, the scene back at the home where the brutal attack took place was so bad, Nocco had crisis counseling on site for everyone.

One of Rios' nephews, who was in the house during the attack, wrote on Facebook Thursday afternoon; 'I love you grandma. I hope everythings good in heaven ik Jason didnt mean he was on drugs its not his fault i just wanna say i love you grandma and let just hope that the girls make it i love you all i love you to jason ik you didnt mean it ima miss you all i love you guys.'

Rios' condition is not clear at this time, and he is in police custody.

'If our community can rally prayers for these young girls and their families, they need them,' said Nocco. 

Meanwhile, friends of Rios are shocked with what happened Thursday.

That's not what Jason would've done,' childhood friend Josh Melching told the Tampa Bay Times. 

'He's always had my brother's and my back. He was a caring person. He was Jason. I don't know how to explain other than that. He was Jason.'

Rios faces one charge of murder and two counts of attempted murder, the sheriff’s office said.
