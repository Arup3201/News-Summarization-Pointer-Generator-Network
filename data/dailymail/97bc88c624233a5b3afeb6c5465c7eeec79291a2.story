Rule change: Migrant workers from Romania and Bulgaria will soon be eligible to work elsewhere in the economy

The cost of British-grown fruit and vegetables could soar by 15 per cent because of a shortage of migrant farm workers, government advisers warned yesterday.

A third of the country’s 67,000 seasonal farm jobs are filled by Romanians and Bulgarians, who are not allowed to work elsewhere in the economy.

But that restriction will be lifted in January, so citizens of the two countries will be free to take up jobs in hotels, restaurants, coffee shops and care homes.

The Migration Advisory Committee said ministers faced a choice between allowing a new wave of migrants from outside the EU to replace them, or seeing prices rise.

The cost of celery, strawberries and salad leaves could leap by 10 or 15 per cent, advisers said.

The committee said it did not believe British workers would be prepared to take the farm jobs.

Chairman David Metcalf said the way the benefits system works meant a person working long hours in a field could receive as little as £100 extra per month.

They would also face the problem of having to return to benefits, as most work lasts for only six months each year.

Temporary curbs were imposed on Romanians and Bulgarians in 2005 to protect the British labour market, but they expire in December and, under EU laws, cannot  be extended.

The present Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme allows 21,750 Romanians and Bulgarians to come into Britain for half the year.

When this ends, Professor Metcalf said farmers expect many of them to move to other roles because of the ‘intensity’ of harvesting.

The jobs can be physically demanding, with workers bending down 4,000 times during a typical eight-hour  celery-picking shift.

The academic added: ‘The Poles have graduated to jobs in hospitality, and into the care sector and construction. One could see the Romanians and Bulgarians doing something similar.’

Professor Metcalf said it was up to ministers to decide what to do next. One option, which the National Farmers Union is urging the Government to pursue, is to introduce a new seasonal agricultural workers scheme for migrants from countries such as the Ukraine or Croatia.

This would help to keep down  the cost of British food, but would create a significant political headache for a government committed to reducing migration.

The workers would mostly be coming into the Tory-dominated shires.  The impact of the new rules is not expected to be felt immediately, but the report said prices were likely to rise within one or two years.

It gave the example of one firm, which charged an average of 75p for an iceberg lettuce between 2007 and 2012. In 2008, when there was a shortage of staff, this leapt to 86p.

Professor Metcalf said that if the labour supply ‘dwindled’ when Romanians and Bulgarians get full EU rights in January, operators may have to ‘drive wages up’ to secure staff.

He said: ‘In those circumstances, therefore, it’s possible that supermarkets would charge higher prices.’

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We are grateful for the MAC’s report and note its conclusion that there is little evidence the supply of seasonal labour will decline in the next one or two years.

‘We shall consider the MAC’s advice very carefully. But in general we want to encourage employers to recruit from the resident labour market where possible.’
