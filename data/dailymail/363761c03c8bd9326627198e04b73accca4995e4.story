These stunning images show men enduring one of the most dangerous jobs in the world - working in highly toxic sulphur mines on the side of a volcano.

Braving horrific conditions, these workers breathe in highly noxious gases without masks while they risk their lives carrying loads of up to 70kg up steep quarry walls.

The men - working in Ijen, a super volcanic range in East Java, Indonesia - have a short life expectancy as a result of the hardship they face on a daily basis.

Grueling: With a scarf wrpped around his head, a miner begins the punishing climb out of the crater of a mine in Indonesia on his way to the collection point with his baskets, which usually hold over 70kg of sulphur

Danger: Workers risk their lives in highly toxic sulphur mines at the Kawah Ijen volcano in East Java, Indonesia

Toxic: A miner braces himself before lifting heavy baskets laden with sulphur while fumes billow out behind him

Perilous: With blocks of sulphur in a basket slung over his back, this miner sets off to a collections point and prepares to cross wooden planks over a crevice while toxic fumes fill the air

The sulphur they produce is used to make a huge range of products from concrete and asphalt to matches and the bleaching of white sugar.

Many of them work shirtless, and have huge growths on their back from the loads.

Photographer Brad Ambrose captured the breathtaking pictures along with his friend Geoff Mackley, while trekking through Indonesia.

The 38-year-old photographer said: 'It would be one of the more dangerous jobs in the world - not just because of the fall risks, but because of the gases the miners work in.

Spectacular: Despite the dangers faced by the workers, the stunning scenery also draws in photographers and tourists (pictured)

'The majority are working in there with no masks to filter out the deadly gases.

'Even though we each used a gas filter set, at some stages we could still taste the gas.'

The photographers, from New Zealand, travelled from midnight to try and get pictures of the sulphur fires before sunrise.

Unfortunately, it was already too light to capture them when they arrived, but they shot lots of the men working.

Brad said: 'The physical wear and tear on the bodies of these miners must be horrific.

'They carry baskets in excess of 70kg up and out of the crater and down to the collection point, about three kms and most of them do this at least twice a day.'

Among the industries which require the use of sulphur are fertilisers, cosmetics, insecticides and petroleum processing.

It is also used to manufacture paper, paints, plastics, rubber, batteries, explosives and film.
