Challenge: Half of Ed Miliband's Shadow Cabinet want him to commit the party to an in-out referendum on Europe

Half of Ed Miliband’s Shadow Cabinet want the Labour leader to commit the party to an in-out referendum on Europe, it was claimed last night.

In a challenge to Mr Miliband’s authority, 15 Labour MPs and the party’s biggest donor launched a campaign yesterday to force a policy change on the issue.

It came as a poll found that Britons would vote narrowly – 51 per cent to 49 – to leave the EU if there were a referendum now.

Businessman John Mills – who recently gave Labour shares worth £1.6million in his home shopping company JML – said it would be ‘unwise’ and ‘undemocratic’ for the party to refuse to give the public a say.

Mr Mills even endorsed David Cameron’s plans to renegotiate Britain’s relations with Brussels and said that others in Labour are ‘tacitly’ backing a referendum, which Mr Miliband has repeatedly ruled out.

One source in the campaign group Labour For A Referendum said: ‘At least ten members of the Shadow Cabinet [nearly half] are supportive.’

Last week, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘I don’t think we should set our face against a referendum and I certainly don’t think we can ever afford to give the impression that we know better than the voting public.’

Backing: James Wharton, the Tory MP who is piloting a backbench Bill through the Commons to enshrine the right to a referendum in law, claimed the Bill could become law with the support of Labour rebels

James Wharton, the Tory MP who is 
piloting a backbench Bill through the Commons to enshrine the right to a
referendum in law, last night claimed the Bill – which has David 
Cameron’s backing – could become law with the support of Labour rebels.

A senior Tory told the Mail: ‘We can get this through if these people put their money where their mouths are. That’s all it takes.’

Wealthy pensioners could lose their free TV licences as well as their winter fuel allowance if Labour wins the next election.

Ed Balls said on Monday that a future Labour government would strip cold weather payments from pensioners on the 40p tax rate.

He originally ruled out raiding TV 
licences – worth up to £145.50 a year –  but then said it might be 
pragmatic to do so.

But he later threw the policy into chaos, admitting 
that it could cost more than it would save to scrap free TV licences.

Senior Labour figures who have voiced support for a referendum include defence spokesman Jim Murphy, former Europe minister Keith Vaz and Jon Cruddas, who is running Mr Miliband’s policy review.

Mr Cruddas said a failure to ‘trust people’ would lead public anger to ‘fester’.

But Mr Miliband and foreign affairs spokesman Douglas Alexander have ruled out a referendum.

They do not want to risk being forced in government to leave the EU.

Pressure for them to change their stance built yesterday when Labour MP Kate Hoey revealed that she was approached by a member of the Shadow Cabinet who told her that the party ‘will have to’ announce it is backing a referendum before next May’s European elections.

Last night, Mr Mills warned that failing to back a referendum would cost votes in marginal seats.
