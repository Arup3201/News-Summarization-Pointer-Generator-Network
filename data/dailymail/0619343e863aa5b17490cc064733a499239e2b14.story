Alabama quarterback A.J. McCarron may have been putting on a championship-winning performance on the field, but all eyes were on the stands - and his girlfriend - on Monday night.

Katherine 
Webb sent broadcasters drooling and viewers tweeting their admiration after she cheered for McCarron as his team swiftly defeated Notre Dame to win 
the BCS National Championship.

In the first quarter of the game, the ESPN cameras panned to 23-year-old reigning Miss Alabama, who was sitting with McCarron's mother, and the sportscasters immediately perked up.

'I'm telling you, you quarterbacks, you get all the good looking women,' 73-year-old Brent Musburger gushed. 'What a beautiful woman.'

Who's that girl? Katherine Webb, the reigning Miss Alabama who is dating Alabama quarterback A.J. McCarron, became an internet sensation after catching sportscasters' eyes on Monday night

Fan favourite: The model watched her boyfriend defeat Notre Dame with his mother, Dee Dee Bonner

'Wow!' former Ohio State quarterback Kirk Herbstreit added. 'AJ's doing some things right down in Tuscaloosa.'

'If you're a youngster in Alabama, start getting the football out and throw it around the backyard with pop,' Musburger said.

Within minutes of ESPN broadcasting her image, Webb became an internet sensation and saw her Twitter followers soar from around 2,300 to more than 125,000 by Tuesday morning.

She even caught the eye of Arizona Cardinals defensive end Darnell Dockett, who posted his phone number on Twitter as he attempted to ask her out.

Together: The couple has been dating for a month after a friend connected them through Twitter

Model girlfriend: Webb, 23, also competed in Miss USA last year and placed in the top ten, left

'[W]hen gave over [sic], lets go to wing stop then King of diamond,' Dockett tweeted, referring to a strip club.

He then realized the tweet was public, and added that it was supposed to be a direct message to her. The tweets have now been deleted.

Much to the disbelief of her boyfriend, Webb also gained NBC star LeBron James as a follower.

'No way,' McCarron, 22, said repeatedly after learning about her new fan. 'Man, I'm going to Tweet him and I'm going to get a follow. That's messed up.'

Webb was also in shock about the reaction, revealing that her phone was drained of battery thanks to an influx of new followers, texts and calls.

Popular: After the broadcast, Webb's Twitter followers jumped from around 2,300 to more than 127,000

'My followers went from 2,300 this 
morning to 96,000 by the end of the night,' she told Yahoo! Sports. 'I don't know if I should even
check now, I don't know what is going on.

'I guess [Musburger] said something but I don't know what it was because I haven't seen it.'

She went on: 'Oh Lord. This is the first time that's 
kind of ever happened for me', USA Today reported. 'I've 
never dated someone who's actually been in the spotlight, so it's a new 
thing for me.'

But to McCarron, the attention came as no surprise.

'I know she's good looking,' McCarron 
said. 'She's gonna have guys that jaw-drop over her. That's life. I 
guess I'm the blessed one at the end of the day. She's gotta put up with
me.'

Webb, who grew up in Montgomery, Alabama and graduated from Auburn, finished in the top 10 in the Miss USA competition in June and lives and works as a model in Los Angeles.

Support: Webb and McCarron both laughed off the attention, and the QB added: 'I'm the one who's blessed'

McCarron and Webb met over Twitter 
when a friend connected them in November, and in December, the sportsman
went to the pageant for Miss Alabama USA 2013, where Webb ended her 
reign.

The pair have been together since and grinned for photographs together on Christmas Eve.

They were pictured sharing a celebratory kiss at the end of the game on Monday - but after McCarron had already shared an embrace with his parents.

'That means he's a family guy, a mama's 
boy,' Webb told Yahoo! Sports. 'And I'm totally good 
with that. It's that personality that attracted me to him in the first 
place. It was never about his status on the team.'

Winner: McCarron holds The Coaches' Trophy after the BCS National Championship college football game against Notre Dame on Monday night. Alabama won the title 42-14

Star player: McCarron threw four touchdown passes and finished with 264 yards through the air

McCarron also shared his admiration for his girlfriend.

'I think she was doing pretty well for 
herself before that, Miss Alabama and competing in Miss USA,' he said. 'She's a great girl and I'm happy we're together.'

Alabama beat Notre Dame 42-14 on Monday to win their third college football title in four years.

McCarron threw four touchdown passes and finished with 264 yards through the air, while running back Eddie Lacy and receiver Amari Cooper had two scores each.

The victory confirmed Nick Saban as the most successful active coach in college football with four national titles, taking him within two of Alabama great Bear Bryant.
