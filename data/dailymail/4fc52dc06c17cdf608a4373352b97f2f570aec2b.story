A Saudi woman was questioned by police for driving a car after she was forced to take over the wheel when her husband fell ill.

Officers stopped the woman after receiving reports she was driving near the city of Madinah - flouting a strict ban that prevents females from getting behind the wheel in Saudi Arabia.

However, the police soon discovered she had only done so because her husband had complained of feeling unwell.

Pushing for equal rights: A woman was stopped by police for driving a car in Saudi Arabia after being forced to take over from her husband when he fell ill. It is the latest in a series of similar incidents in recent years that have led to protests by activists like Manal Al-Sherif (above) against the country's strict ban on female drivers

Her husband, an engineer, was taken to a local clinic for treatment and later pledged not to allow his wife to drive again.

The case is the latest in a series of similar incidents that has prompted protests from women calling for a change in the law, it was reported on Gulfnews.com.

In November last year, Nassima Al Sadah became the third Saudi woman after Manal Al-sherif and Samar Badawi to file a lawsuit over the ban on women from obtaining driving licences in Saudi Arabia.

Manal al-Sherif was arrested and detained for 10 days in May 2011 after posting a video of herself on YouTube as she drove around Khobar.

Making their point: al-Sherif and a group of other women started a Facebook page in 2011 which urged authorities to lift the driving ban

al-Sherif and a group of other women started a Facebook page called 'Teach me how to drive so I can protect myself,' which urged authorities to lift the driving ban.

Several other Saudi women went on to film themselves behind the wheel of a car in the days after her detention.

Women struggle to get around in Saudi Arabia and it isn't just a result of the driving ban.

As far as they can go: Saudi women pose in a vehicle at a car show, but as it stands they are not allowed to drive in the Middle East state

Taxis can be sparse and some men refuse to drive a woman without a chaperone - usually their husband or a close male relative.

Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world to ban women - both Saudi and foreign - from driving.

The prohibition forces families to hire live-in drivers and those who cannot afford the $300 to $400 a month for a driver must rely on male relatives to drive them to work, school, shopping or the doctor.

Women are also barred from voting.
