From Heidi Montag’s breast reduction to Cameron Diaz's Botox admission, it seems cosmetic surgery was big business in 2013.

And vain Brits are following their favourite celebrities' leads, with 2014 set to see a huge surge in treatments - some of which you've probably never even heard of.

A new survey has
 analysed the most popular treatments of the last year: arm lifts, buttocks lifts and even 'buffalo hump' surgery dominated the cosmetic world.

Heidi Montag and Cameron Diaz have admitted to plastic surgery and it seems to be getting more and more popular, if knew research is anything to go by

Buffalo hump removal, in which there was negligible interest in 
2012, saw a 350 per cent increase in 2013, found researchers.

This surgery removes the fatty 
build-up at the base of the neck caused by excessive weight gain.

Although it’s still not widely available in the UK, demand amongst 
British patients is certainly on the up, according to research.

A spokesperson for WhatClinic.com, who carried out the research, said: 'Buffalo humps can be an unusual side effect of certain medications, but more often they appear over time, through obesity.  Poor posture doesn't help either, making it more noticeable.

'This issue undoubtedly leaves sufferers feeling self-conscious and miserable, especially as it occurs in an area of the body that people don't usually worry about. A relatively simple surgical procedure can correct the problem, and restore the person's normal shape.'

Arm lifts saw a staggering 473 per cent increase in 2013, as many patients waved goodbye to those dreaded bingo wings.

Mini-facelifts dropped by 60 per cent as less invasive treatments, such as dermal fillers proved more popular with patients

Fluctuations in weight and growing older can cause the upper arm skin to sag, which is what the surgery - also known as brachioplasty - corrects.

The cost, however, is not for the light of pocket, averaging £3,872 - over a third (35 per cent) more than it cost in 2012.

With Beyonce’s booty once again taking centre stage in her raunchy new video, Partition, it's not surprising that enquiries into buttock lifts more than tripled (221 per cent) last year.

However, the surgery, which aims to contour and sculpt patients' rears, comes with a hefty price tag of around £4,226 and experts recommend no physical exertion for three to six weeks following treatment.

It wasn't just women going under the knife in 2013, as male breast reduction enquiries more than doubled last year.

However, over a third (35 per cent) of those looking to banish their 'moobs', went overseas to countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic and Belgium, where surgeries are considerably cheaper.

Full abdominoplasty, also known as a tummy tuck, saw enquiries fall by half (46 per cent) last year, while abdominal etching dropped by almost a fifth (17 per cent).

Etching, hugely popular in the 1990s, is aimed at people who are quite fit but have a small amount of fat covering their abs. Demand for both procedures is now falling as many patients opt for alternatives like fat transfer, which saw a 126 per cent increase in the past 12 months.

Mini-facelifts also dropped by 60 per cent as less invasive treatments, such as non-surgical facelifts and dermal fillers (both up 93 per cent) and Thermage skin tightening (up 80 per cent) proved more popular with patients.
