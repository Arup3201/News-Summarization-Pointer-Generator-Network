For more than 16 years the International Space Station and its team of astronauts have given us unprecedented access to breathtaking and awe-inspiring sights of our planet. 

And now the current crew, on Expedition 42, has created a collection bringing together some of the most stunning images of Earth's landscapes. 

From the glittering lights over the English Channel to the sand dunes in Oman and the concrete nature of New York, the world's varied landmarks have been recorded from on board the orbiting craft.

The Rub' al Khali, also known as the 'Empty Quarter', is the second largest sand desert in the world. It has distinctive dune formations and covers 250,000 square miles (650,000 square kilometres) including regions of Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen

The current Expedition 42 crew on ISS has created a collection of images taken from the station of landscapes on Earth. One of the most striking photos shows the glittering lights of the south coast of England and the north coast of France, taken above the English Channel in January (pictured). It shows concentrations of light in major towns and in the distance a green light that looks like the Northern Lights glows

All of these images form part of the Nasa: Landscapes by Samantha Cristoforetti collection. Ms Cristoforetti is one of six astronauts on board the station as part of Expedition 42. 

Her colleagues include commander Barry Wilmore, flight engineer Terry Virts and Russian cosmonauts Elena Serova, Alexander Samoukutyaev and Anton Shkaplerov.

The expedition began on 9 November last year, when Expedition 41 undocked and they are due to return in May.

One of the most striking images in the collection shows the glittering lights of the south coast of England and the north coast of France, taken above the English Channel in January.

It shows concentrations of light in major cities and towns and in the distance, on the curvature of the Earth, a green light that looks like the Northern Lights glows.

A second image was taken above the big island of Hawaii in the North Pacific Ocean. It was captured on 28 February and the peaks of volcanoes Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea can be seen in the centre of the 4,028 square mile (10,432 square kilometre) land mass. Mauna Loa is the world's largest, and one of its most active, volcanoes

The expedition also captured the contrasting and dense landscape of New York City. The grey, concrete-coloured image is in stark contrast to the vibrant blues of the ocean. In particular, the midtown areas of Manhattan are so populated and compacted that the buildings look almost black. Larger, more open spaces of airports including John F Kennedy can just be distinguished

The entire International Space Station was spun 180 degrees yesterday and lowered slightly in its orbit last month so that visiting spacecraft can bring more cargo to the station.

The remarkable manoeuvre saw a European spacecraft ‘slow’ the speed of the station.

This changed the height of its orbit  by about 1.6 miles (2.5km), before the station was spun back again to its original position.

A second image was taken above the big island of Hawaii in the North Pacific Ocean. It was captured on 28 February and the peaks of volcanoes Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea can be seen towards the centre of the 4,028 square mile (10,432 square kilometre) land mass. 

Mauna Loa is the world's largest, and one of its most active, volcanoes. It doesn't erupt as frequently Kilauea, but when it does eruptions produce rivers of lava that have threatened the nearby town of Hilo.

It rises almost 5.5 miles (9km)  and almost 90 per cent of its surface is covered by lavas less than 4,000 years old.

From the relatively remote island of Hawaii, the expedition has also captured the contrasting and dense landscape of New York City. 

The grey, concrete-coloured image is in stark contrast to the vibrant blues of the ocean.

Further west, Ms Cristoferetti captured this image above Yosemite National Park in California. The snow-topped mountains in the region, including Mount Dana, Mount Lyell and Mount Warren are shown. The small lake in the bottom of the picture is called Mono Lake with Paoha Island in the centre. The park covers a staggering 1,190 square miles (3,081 square kilometres)

During its orbit over Africa, the crew captured the coastline of Mozambique (pictured). The coastline is rocky and jagged, especially near Baia De Sofala, and its total coastline stretches for 4,313 miles (6,942 km)

David MacLean from the GIS FacultyCentre of Geographic Sciences (COGS), told MailOnline this image of Earth shows the Bahamas, in particular Long, Acklins and Crooked Islands, Cuba to the left and Florida to the right of centre

In particular, the midtown areas of Manhattan are so populated and compacted that the buildings look almost black.

Larger, more open spaces of airports including John F Kennedy can just be distinguished too.

During its orbit over Africa and heading across the Middle East and into Asia the crew captured the coastline of Mozambique, Kazakhstan and Tamgaly, and Pakistan. 

The coastline of Mozambique is rocky and jagged, especially near Baia De Sofala and its total coastline stretches for 4,313 miles (6,942 km). 

Elsewhere in Africa, Lake Kariba between Zambia and Zimbabwe is shown, photographed from almost 250 miles (400km) in orbit around the Earth. 

It is the world's largest manmade lake and reservoir and was filled in the early 1960s after the Kariba Dam was completed.  

Tamgaly is a petroglyph site in the Semirechye, Kazakhstan, around 74 miles (120km) to northwest of Almaty. 

The majority of the 5,000 petroglyphs are in the main canyon and are mostly from the Bronze Age. 

The name Tamgaly in Kazakh means 'painted or marked place' and the region became a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2004.

Over Pakistan, Ms Cristoferrti photographed the Indus River Delta - an area of the South Asian country where Indus River flows into the Arabian Sea. 

On either side of the delta are Keti Bunder South Wildlife Sanctuary and Marho Kotri Wildlife Sanctuary and the dry arid region receives between 10 and 19 inches (25 and 50cm) of rainfall a year. 

The delta is home to mangrove forests as well as  the Indus Dolphin.

The crew also captured distinctive dune formations of the Rub' al Khali, also known as the 'Empty Quarter. 

It is the second largest sand desert in the world and covers 250,000 square miles (650,000 square kilometres) including regions of Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.

The International Space Station marked its 10th anniversary of continuous human occupation on 2 November 2010 and since Expedition 1 in 2000 the space station has been visited by more than 215 people.

As of November 2014, there have been 100 Russian launches, 37 space shuttle launches, one test flight and three operational flights by SpaceX’s Dragon as well as a test flight and two operational flights by Orbital Science’s Cygnus. 

A total of 184 spacewalks have been conducted in support of space station assembly totaling over 1,152 hours, or approximately 48 days.

The space station, including its large solar arrays, spans the area of a U.S. football field, including the end zones, and weighs 924,739 pounds. 

The complex now has more livable room than a conventional six-bedroom house, and has two bathrooms, a gymnasium and a 360-degree bay window.
