Margaret Pratt yesterday returned to the boat on which her husband, Roger, was brutally murdered

Just one week ago, she was enjoying a dream holiday sailing around the Caribbean with her husband on their luxury yacht.

But yesterday, Margaret Pratt returned to the boat a widow following the brutal murder of Roger, 62, in St Lucia, last Friday.

Her sunglasses failed to hide two black eyes and bruised cheekbones - a result of the brutal beating inflicted upon her by a gang of robbers who attacked them on their £200,000 vessel in the middle of the night.

Stood on a concrete jetty in a straw hat, she bit her lip and put her hand to her mouth as her beloved boat, Magnetic Attraction, was moved to another harbour.

Dressed in a white sleeveless dress and a straw hat with red ribbon, she looked distressed as she watched the yacht sail away.

Two friends boarded the 41ft vessel yesterday lunchtime and manoeuvred it out of the marine police unit, as Mrs Pratt looked on, flanked by maritime police officers.

Only last week, the same friends had enjoyed dinner with Mr and Mrs Pratt, who had been married for 37 years.

A picture on Mrs Pratt’s travel blog showed the four of them, smiling and tanned, as they ate at the beautiful Marigot Bay resort.

Beneath the photograph, she wrote that the meal was ‘exquisite’, saying: ‘Altogether a delightful and memorable day. Happiness is...’.

Mr Pratt, a retired financial consultant and engineer, was bludgeoned to death by at least three robbers, in the industrial port of Vieux Fort.

A post-mortem found he died of asphyxiation due to ‘blunt force trauma’.

The couple were halfway through a year-long round-the-world trip and planned to sail to Trinidad on Monday.

Police said the attackers reached the yacht in a stolen green canoe before forcing the couple into separate rooms, where they beat them in an attempt to obtain valuables.

Boarded: The yacht is removed from the police holding area to another harbour on St Lucia

When the gang fled, Mrs Pratt went looking for her husband and found him floating in the water.

She sought help from the occupants of a nearby boat, who called the police.

Five men have been arrested on suspicion of robbery and murder and police said they expected to charge some of the men ‘imminently’.

Vernon Francois, the commissioner of the island’s police force, told the Mail he believed the men ‘did not intend to kill’ Mr Pratt and that it was a robbery which ‘got out of hand’.

Mr Francois said: ‘We know that five individuals planned the robbery, but we do not know how many boarded the boat.

‘The men are cooperating and giving information about it.

‘We believe they had done some planning and wanted to rob a yacht.

‘They did not know these people or specifically target this couple.

‘We understand they did not go with the intention to kill. They beat them to say ‘give me what we want’.

He said that, in St Lucia, the charge
 of ‘manslaughter’ did not exist, however, and that the men were likely 
to be charged with murder, even if they did not all board the boat.

‘They did not have guns or knives but they used physical force to try to get them to get what they wanted.

‘Normally they ask for cash.’

Mr
 Francois said the suspects, in their twenties, were all from Vieux 
Fort, a depressed region of St Lucia away from the tourist resorts, 
where unemployment is high.

He said Mr Pratt’s body had been released and forensic tests were now complete on the yacht.

‘Mrs Pratt is free to leave St Lucia whenever she wants. We have finished our questioning.’

Mrs Pratt is receiving support from the British consulate and the St Lucian government.

Aniel Innocent, press officer for the Royal Saint Lucia Police, said: ‘Mrs Pratt also has some good friends in the area, British people, who are providing emotional support for her at this difficult time.’

A source close to the investigation said Mr Pratt had been punched eight times on his face and head.

They said: 'The bruising is consistent with a fist. It was mostly on the left side of his face.

'We believe he was punched unconscious and then fell overboard.

'He remained unconscious and asphyxiated or, in other words, he drowned.

'We do not believe anyone pushed him into the water because they would not have needed to. He was unconscious.

'He also had two minor rib fractures, which could be from hitting something as he fell on to the deck.'

There was no sign of skin beneath his fingernails, a common sign that there was a struggle during the attack.

However, the source said: 'The police are checking the injuries of the assailants to determine if there was a fight or night.'
