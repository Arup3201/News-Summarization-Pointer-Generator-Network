To highlight the current Movember campaign, former Head of Sport at the Daily Mail, Bryan Cooney, interviewed fellow prostate cancer sufferer, Scotland legend Denis Law. Here, Cooney reveals the illuminating results. 

There's no discernible reluctance in Denis Law to recall one of the most embarrassing own goals in medical history.

He whisks you back to 2003 and a doctor’s consulting room. He’s there at the behest of an anxious wife; he’s experiencing a troublesome ache in the lower abdomen.

The biopsies have been performed and now, three agonising weeks later, the specialist delivers a sombre conclusion. The football legend has prostate cancer.

Law becomes a man in torment. He swoons. Embarrassing, or what?

He delivers his recollections with a nervous laugh, but if he experienced humiliation that day, the scar is not evident.

‘I think that they thought in there that I’d had a heart attack. Because, as soon as he told me, I said I didn’t feel well.

‘Hey, I wasn’t laughing at the time. I obviously conked out. Fainted. I was completely out. It’s the Law Family trait that we don’t like hearing bad news.’

This interview with the Lawman is being filmed courtesy of the Movember campaign. It pursues a certain logic: two Aberdonians, who once lived less than a mile apart, locked into an insidious common denominator; one victim of prostate cancer being quizzed by another.

Law is the epitome of punctuality. Right on the appointed hour of noon, he steps into the capacious lounge of the Northenden Golf Club. It’s a holiday home to him, a place where he can be himself. The last time we met here he was in proletariat mode, demolishing sausage, egg and chips.

Time tends to blur memories, of course, but he’s far more amenable now. At that time, he was about to launch another autobiography and figured that too much compliance with me would somehow inhibit sales. This time he is generosity itself.

Now, he finds himself in a penalty box he never infiltrated in his playing days when he scored more than 250 goals, most of them for Manchester United. This one delineates the grey area between life and death. It tends to focus minds.

Let’s return, for one moment, to that display in the doctor’s surgery and consider the paradoxes at work here.

In spite of his apparently flimsy body structure, Law was an authentic tough hombre who, for two decades, defied the various malignancies of footballers trying to break him physically and psychologically.

Ignoring the height and physical superiority of his tormentors, he’d laugh in their faces when he was kicked, mentally consulting his diary and pencilling in a painful retribution. This was rarely delayed.

A few decades later, he keels over at a medical diagnosis. It scarcely equates with reason. Mind you, he has always been two distinct and enigmatic personages.

Away from football, he remains one of the most self effacing men on the planet. Whenever he attends an official function, for instance, he always asks a companion to accompany him to the toilet just in case he is claimed by hero-worshiping fans. He doesn’t favour fuss.

In contrast, on the professional field of his dreams, he seemed to encourage it. Here, the message was all about theatrics and melodrama.

We return to that consulting room. The man has emerged from the swoon, but the landscape is, if anything, grimmer and more industrial as ever.

He is presented with a list of options. Radiotherapy is mooted. The trouble is if this does not demolish the tumour, then he can’t have the operation known as a radical prostatectomy. So that’s delete. There’s another form of treatment that he doesn’t even wish to talk about. So that’s discarded.

He opts for an appointment with the knife. ‘I’d rather get rid of whatever I’ve got,’ he says. You can see he’s reliving the moment: he’s wringing his hands so hard that you expect to see water emerge at any time. ‘We’re all cowards, men.’

We return to the emotional front. Certainly, mine were scattered after my operation. One day, in intensive care and attached to myriad tubes, I’m laughing hysterically at the incongruity of it all; the next, I’m sobbing my heart out after listening to some poignant music. I only stop when I remember the words of an old newspaper boss of mine about never showing emotion.

I notice Law’s eyes are glistening. ‘Hey, (initially) you think you’re not going to see the family again - the grandchildren. For me, initially, it was the end of the world. Why me? Then you find out you’re not alone any more. There are thousands (like you). You put things into perspective.

‘You look at others and know that you’re not too bad. But, as I say, it’s not easy to be unemotional, Cancer? Jesus! What is this?’

And what about the possible diminishment of sexual activity? He brushes this aside as if it were mere dust on the mantelpiece. ‘Don’t forget, I had five children. So things were not in that other part of the world the important thing. The importance had to be to get back into a healthy state and return into a normal life.’

Law and I are at different places with the illness. I’ve had the surgery and the radiotherapy, and next week I start the hormone treatment. Law, at 74 four years my senior, seems to be managing the disease that bit better. I sincerely hope his situation doesn’t change.

Legends come. Legends go. Denis Law, hopefully, is going nowhere.
