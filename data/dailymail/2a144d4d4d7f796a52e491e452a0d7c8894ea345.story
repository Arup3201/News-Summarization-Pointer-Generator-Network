It's not easy being ridiculously good looking. Just ask Rob Lowe.

The 50-year-old actor made some controversial comments about how tough his career has been because of his attractiveness, while promoting his new memoir 'Love Life' in a New York Times interview.

In the book, Lowe expresses preference for roles that transform his looks - like playing a plastic surgeon with a permanently surprised look on his face in Behind the Candelabra.

'There’s this unbelievable bias and 
prejudice against quote-unquote good-looking people, that they can’t be 
in pain or they can’t have rough lives or be deep or interesting,' Lowe told the Times.

Tough luck: Actor Rob Lowe says he was too good looking in the 80s to get the roles he really wanted. Pictured on the left in 1983's The Outsiders, which turned him into a teen heart-throb. Now that his face has aged, he's able to tackle more meaty roles like the plastic surgeon in Behind the Candelabra

It wasn't until recently, Lowe confessed, that his looks tamed enough for him to get the roles he really wanted.

'They can’t be any of the things that you long to play as an actor. I’m getting to play those parts now and loving it. When I was a teen idol, I was so goddamn pretty I wouldn’t have taken myself seriously,' the actor added.

When asked why people found his comedic 
roles on TV shows 'Parks and Recreation' and 'Californication' 
surprising, Lowe said: 'Again, there's a historical bias that good-looking people are not funny'.

Funny guy: Lowe says people found his comedic role on Parks and Rec surprising because of his looks. Above, another still from The Outsiders

Next steps: Lowe will next star in 'Sex Tape', a movie about a couple trying to get back copies of a personal video they accidentally sent to their friends (still on the left). His new memoir 'Love Life' is available for purchase on Amazon now (right)

Lowe first became a heart-throb in 1983 with his role in The Outsiders.

He went on to star in several 80s coming-of-age films like St Elmo's Fire and Oxford Blues, becoming part of the infamous 'Brat Pack'.

However, his popularity with females came as a shock for a young Lowe, who always considered himself brainy.

'My deep dark secret is that I was a nerd in school,' he said.

'I liked the theater. I liked to study. I wasn't very goot at sports. It took being famous to make me cool, which, by the way, I never forget.'

Lowe's will next star in 'Sex Tape', which follows a couple played by Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal as they try to get back a personal film they accidentally sent to all of their friends.

Lowe himself is no stranger to the plot, having been the star of his own sex-tape scandal.
