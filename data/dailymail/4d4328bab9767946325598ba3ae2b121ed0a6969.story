A mother who went to extraordinary lengths to con her family and friends out of thousands of dollars by convincing them she was dying of cancer, has pleaded guilty to theft by deception in a bid to escape jail.

Lori Stilley, 41, of Delran, New Jersey duped supporters by telling them she had Stage IV bladder cancer - even writing a book about her experience, making t-shirts and holding fund-raisers in the scam.

On Monday she entered a plea bargain that calls for her to receive four years probation when she's sentenced in July.Â 

Lori Stilley, 40, has pleaded guilty to accepting money from fundraisers after falsely claiming she had bladder cancer

The prosecutor's office said it all began in February, 2011, when Stilley allegedly told friends and family that she had been diagnosed with Stage III bladder cancer and had to undergo radiation and chemotherapy

Under the terms of the deal she would also have to pay restitution ranging from $15,000 to $20,000 and perform at least 100 hours of community service.

She also will have to undergo a psychiatric evaluation, reports NBC10.

In February 2011, Stilley told those close to her and posted on Facebook that she had been diagnosed with cancer.

In April, she said her condition had 
worsened, and supporters quickly raised more than $12,000 
for medical expenses, prepared her meals and even paid for the 
'inspirational' mother's wedding.

Her 'Team Lori Rocks' support page on Facebook attracted more than 300 friends, all eager to make the New Jersey woman's life as happy as possible in her last few months.

But, after suddenly announcing a 'miraculous recovery' in November, suspicion arose around the mother-of-two's 'condition'.

Friends and family paid for a wedding for the mother of two, after learning she wanted to wed her boyfriend 'before she died'

Stilley was never treated or even diagnosed with cancer, the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office and Delran police said

Supporters realized they had not seen 
any medical bills or doctor's notes, and no one had been with her when 
she had visited the hospital for her cancer.

Stilley was never treated or even diagnosed with cancer, the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office and Delran police said.

Prosecutor
Robert D. Bernardi said in a statement: 'To represent that she was 
dying from this terrible disease for the sake of personal gain and 
sympathy goes way beyond simply being a criminal offense; it was 
extremely cruel to those who were concerned and worked hard to lend 
assistance.'

In February last year, the con-artist told friends she had Stage III cancer, and would have to undergo radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

In April 2011, she told them her condition had deteriorated and she would need to go to a hospice.

Her heartbreaking tale prompted friends to rally around her, hosting banquets, fundraising parties and selling t-shirts to raise money for her.

When they learned she wanted to marry
her boyfriend William before she died, her army of supporters donated 
their own money to pay for her wedding.

She wrote: 'I pray I will be around to look at this book 20 years from now with my children.

'If not, I have a sense of peace knowing they have their Mommy's story to keep for the rest of their lives. I'm still waiting on that miracle.'

Michele Fagerstrom, 43, a former Delran resident who lives in Poughkeepsie, New York, attended two fund-raisers and bought T-shirts whose proceeds were to go toward Stilley's medical bills.

Ms Fagerstrom told Philly.com: 'Who would do that? Just the repercussion of such a huge lie.

'It's overwhelming to even think that somebody would be creative enough to come up with that.'

Stilley surrendered to Delran police, accompanied by an attorney. She remains free on $25,000 bail. Her husband was not charged.
