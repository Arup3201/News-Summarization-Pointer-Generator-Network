Calgary Police were notified of a similar case investigated last year in Dublin which led to Azzopardi's identification

Australian woman Samantha Azzopardi, who duped Irish authorities last year into thinking she was an Eastern European child sex slave, has allegedly attempted a similar story in Canada.

Azzopardi, 26, from Sydney, walked into a Calgary health centre on September 16 alleging she was a 14-year-old who was the victim of an abduction and prolonged sexual assault, Canadian authorities said on Monday.

Azzopardi, using the alias Aurora Hepburn, allegedly told investigators she'd endured years of violent sexual abuse and torture.

It was not until last Thursday that the Calgary Police Service was notified of a similar, world headline-making case investigated last year in Dublin.

After liaising with Irish authorities, it was determined the woman in Calgary was Azzopardi.

Azzopardi is charged with public mischief to mislead a peace officer and faces up to five years' jail.

Due to her multiple aliases, Calgary police have released a photo of Azzopardi in the hope the public can provide information about her movements in Calgary.

Irish authorities last year also took the rare step of releasing her photo after she was found wandering Dublin streets and led Irish police to believe that she was a teenage sex-trafficking victim.

Azzopardi drew pictures apparently showing herself being raped, forcing Irish police to release the photo of her in a bid to find her identity.

Azzopardi was subsequently sent back to Australia, where she had a history of fraud-related charges.

The Australian Federal Police declined to comment on the case, saying it was a matter for Canadian authorities.

In Novemeber last year, Azzopardi was found wandering Ireland in a dazed state and unable to communicate.

Initially it was feared that she was a teenage victim of human traffickers as she had drawn pictures of being brought to Ireland on a plane and of her lying on a bed with men, leading police to believe she was forced into prostitution.

She was described as vulnerable and was put in a Dublin hospital after concerns were raised that was she an Eastern European teenager who had been trafficked into the country.

However she was later identified as an Australian with around 40 aliases.

The investigation was hindered by her apparent refusal to speak to police and the HSE - her only form of communication being to write short notes in English.

In November 2013, Irish police feared Azzopardi may have been child sex slave from Europe after she told them she was '14 or 15' and drew pictures of being brought to Ireland on a plane and of her lying on a bed with men

It was announced that Irish police were considering charging Miss Azzopardi with wasting their time after it emerged the worldwide appeal for her identity cost has cost them £200,000.

The huge police investigation into her case involved 2,000 man hours and 115 separate lines of inquiry.

She had been in the care of health authorities in Dublin as a psychiatric patient but the High Court in Dublin soon heard from psychiatrist Brendan Kelly who found she is not suffering from a disorder classed under the Mental Health Act in Ireland.

'She has a particular condition,' said Tim O'Leary, a lawyer for the Health Service Executive. 'That condition is specified and makes her vulnerable.'

Azzopardi had been in Ireland visiting a relative before going missing and being found on Dublin's O'Connell Street - the Irish capital's main shopping thoroughfare - in a distressed state on October 10.

Azzopardi was known to 'easily assume' the persona of an adolescent teenager, so was able to fool police into believing she was just 14 or 15 years old, the Irish Independent reported.

It was also claimed that Azzopardi was convicted in the Brisbane Magistrates Court in 2010 on two charges of making false representations, one charge of possession of a thing with intent to forge documents and one charge of contravening directions.

She was fined $500, to be paid if she reoffended in the following 12 months. Azzopardi was convicted the following month of four separate charges relating to false representations and given the same penalty.

It is understood she was last year convicted interstate for defrauding or deceiving to obtain welfare payments and sentenced to six months imprisonment, suspended for 12 months.

And in June last year she pleaded guilty in Perth Magistrates Court to three counts of opening an account with a cash dealer in a false name, one count of inducing a person to act and three counts of intent to defraud by deceit.

She was sentenced on October 2 last year to six months imprisonment, suspended for 12 months.
