Workers from existing EU countries could be banned from moving to Britain if their economy collapses under Tory plans to overhaul EU rules, it can be revealed.

David Cameron has vowed to put immigration at the heart of his plans to renegotiate the UK’s relationship with Brussels, before holding an in-out referendum.

The Prime Minister has suggested migrants from poor countries joining the EU could be barred from the UK, but is being urged to go further and introduce economic tests for the current 27 member states.

Net migration from EU countries has risen sharply in recent years, hitting 131,000 in the 12 months to March 2014, according to data from the Office for National Statistics

The Tories had promised to cut net migration to the 'tens of thousands' but the target has been smashed by a sharp rise in people arriving from other EU countries, which the UK government cannot control.

Net migration from EU countries has risen sharply in recent years, hitting 131,000 in the 12 months to March 2014.

Mr Cameron used his speech to the Tory conference yesterday to flesh out his ambitions for securing a better deal from the EU.

He promised that ‘when it comes to free movement – I will get what Britain needs’. 

The Prime Minister last year backed the idea of limiting movement by migrants from poorer countries which join the EU.

He suggested ‘even saying until you reach a proper share of an average European Union GDP you can't have freedom of movement’.

The Tories argue that migration between Britain and countries with similar economies like Germany or France are balanced.

But there are ‘vast movements’ between poorer country and wealthier countries.

Mr Cameron proposed saying: ‘Until your economy, until your wealth is similar to our wealth you can't have unrestricted movement.'

David Cameron used his party conference speech in Birmingham to promise tackling freedom of movement rules would be at the heart of his bid to overhaul Britain's relationship with the EU

While the number of people leaving the UK has remained at around 80,000, the numbers arriving from the EU have risen sharply

A future Conservative government will scrap the Human Rights Act, David Cameron said. 

He vowed 'sort out' the European Court of Human Rights.

The PM said the Strasbourg court's rulings had led to 'a whole lot of things that are frankly wrong'.

Mr Cameron said: 'Let me put this very clearly: We do not require instruction on this from judges in Strasbourg.

'So at long last, with a Conservative Government after the next election, this country will have a new British Bill of Rights to be passed in our Parliament, rooted in our values.

'And as for Labour's Human Rights Act? We will scrap it, once and for all.'

When the idea was floated last year, it was suggested that it would only apply to new countries joining the EU.

But Mr Cameron is coming under Cabinet pressure to use his renegotiation to apply the same rules to existing member states.

It would mean that if an EU country was hit by an economic crisis and rising unemployment, people living there would not be able to flock to Britain in search of work.

A senior Conservative source said: ‘We think it can be done, not just for new countries. 

'You can say this is the level your economy must be at before you can have open borders with Britain.

‘And if for example Spain or Italy’s economy collapses below that level, we should be able to say “you can’t come here”.’

One option being explored is to allow countries which use the euro to form much closer bonds, with all those EU countries with own currency to have a much looser relationship with Brussels.

Mr Cameron has come under intense pressure to quell the rise of UKIP, following the defections of two Tory MPs - Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless - and a donor, Arron Banks who handed the party £1million yesterday.

In his conference speech, Mr Cameron put immigration 'at the very heart' of his renegotiation strategy for Europe, which he has promised before staging an in-out referendum by 2017.

He said: 'Britain, I know you want this sorted so I will go to Brussels, I will not take no for an answer and when it comes to free movement – I will get what Britain needs. Anyone who thinks I can't or won't deliver this – judge me by my record.

'I'm the first Prime Minister to veto a Treaty the first Prime Minister to cut the European budget and yes I pulled us out of those European bail-out schemes as well.

'Around that table in Europe they know I say what I mean, and mean what I say.

'So we're going to go in as a country, get our powers back, fight for our national interest and yes – we'll put it to a referendum in or out – it will be your choice.

'And let the message go out from this hall: it is only with a Conservative Government that you will get that choice.'
