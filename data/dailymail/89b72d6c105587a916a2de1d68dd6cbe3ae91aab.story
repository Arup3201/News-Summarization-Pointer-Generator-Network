The real Benjamin Button? Set to air on TLC on August 19, 40-Year-Old Child: A New Case will delve into the medical mystery behind the unknown syndrome, which affects just a handful of people in the world

Unsolved: Gabby's story was first broadcast on TLC two years ago, when her family embarked on a journey to uncover the cause of her disorder

Gabby's story was first broadcast on TLC two years ago, when her family embarked on a journey to uncover the cause of her disorder.

Since then, two new cases of the disease, which is so rare that there is no official name for it, have been discovered.

One of the other cases is a man from Florida with the body of a ten-year-old, despite being 29 years old.

The other is a 31-year-old woman from Brazil who still has the appearance of a toddler.

Sufferers from the disorder. which resembles the one suffered by Brad Pitt's character in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, age just one year for every four years other humans age.

Side effects: While sufferers have normal chromosomes, they all have various cognitive deficiencies, like blindness, deafness, or the inability to walk or eat on their own

Tune in: The one-hour special will air on TLC on Monday, August 19, at 10pm ET

While sufferers have normal chromosomes, they all have various cognitive deficiencies, like Gabby's blindness, or the inability to walk or eat on their own.

'She cries when she is hurting and 
sometimes smiles,' Gabby's mother Mary-Margret told ABC News in 2011. 
'But there's not a whole lot of communication.'

Previous installments of the show have starred Nicky Freeman, a 40-year-old man with the body of a ten-year-old.

In 2011, Dr Richard Walker of 
University of South Florida College of Medicine told ABC News that his 
theory is that these sufferers' bodies develop as independent parts, 
rather than as a single unit.

Slow development: One of the other Benjamin Button cases on the one-hour special is a man from Florida with the body of a ten-year-old, despite being 29 years old

Delayed: Sufferers from the disorder age just one year for every four years that other humans age

Indeed, Gabby's bodily development is very delayed compared to her siblings, although there are no genetic conditions or abnormalities to explain why.

At six years old, when a normal little girl would weigh about 46lbs, Gabby weighed only ten and stood at just two feet tall.

'It doesn't matter what her nutrition is,' said Mrs Williams. 'She doesn't get bigger.'

A one-hour special of 40-Year-Old Child will air on TLC on Monday, August 19, at 10pm ET.
