Benjamin Price went from earning more than £500,000 a year to claiming £71 a week in benefits

A city high-flyer has been awarded a payout from banking giant Morgan Stanley after a tribunal ruled that he was unfairly dismissed from his £518,000-a-year job.

Benjamin Price, who was forced to live on benefits of £71 a week after becoming unemployed, argued that he had sacked because he complained about being paid less than the firm had agreed.

Today the East London Employment Tribunal ruled that his sacking was 'procedurally unfair', and ordered the American bank to pay Mr Price compensation.

The trader was seeking a £1million payout, but the final amount of compensation has not been disclosed.

'We rule that the claimant was unfairly dismissed,' the tribunal panel said today. 'The claimant was employed from 1998 until his dismissal from redundancy, which involved the redundancies of other individuals.

'He claimed he was unfairly chosen for the redundancy process and the allegation was that when he had been in negotiations with Citibank, the respondent orally agreed to increase remunerations and increase his responsibilities.

'The dismissal was procedurally unfair. The respondent agrees to pay an undisclosed amount for unfair dismissal and there is no application for costs.'

Mr Price dropped claims of breach of contract and whistleblowing after evidence emerged which suggested that Morgan Stanley's promise to match the pay packet he could have received at another bank was not legally binding.

Mr Price, of Wimbledon, South London, said he had been headhunted by Citibank in 2010 and offered a deal worth $1.1million (£670,000) a year.

But he agreed to stay at Morgan Stanley after his bosses promised to match the offer, he claimed.

However, not only did his bosses fail to make good on the deal, they cut his wages from £533,000 to £518,000, he said.

Mr Price, 39, had worked at Morgan Stanley for 14 years when he was made redundant in January 2012

He was made redundant in January 2012 
after 14 years at the bank, having worked his way up from analyst to 
senior trader in the company’s derivatives division.

He said the culture at Morgan Stanley was such that it only allowed people to speak out if they agreed with senior bosses.

Mr
Price told the panel yesterday: ‘Despite my good performance, I was a 
squeaky wheel who was not prepared to put up and shut up.

‘This effectively was me signing my own 
death warrant at Morgan Stanley. That was the deal,  $1.1million, they 
offered when I turned down Citibank, and I would not just keep quiet 
about it. I was made assurances by my senior manager at Morgan Stanley, 
Craig Verdon, that they would match this offer.

‘I asked for a written contract from 
Mr Verdon that he would match the $1.1million offered by Citibank, but 
he told me due to the UK 50 per cent bonus tax at the time, he would not
provide one.

‘When I was 
paid $850,000 [£518,000] the following year – not the deal agreed – I 
was told there was not enough money to pay what was agreed.’ But 
Citibank never put its offer in writing either, and was not ‘hammering 
on his door’ to hire him, the tribunal heard.

Mr Price told the tribunal he signed his own 'death warrant' with the company by complaining about pay

Thomas
Linden QC, representing Morgan Stanley, said Mr Price had never 
received a written contract agreeing the new job or terms of the offer.

During
a heated exchange, Mr Linden claimed: ‘The truth is you didn’t have an 
offer to match. It is quite common for bankers at bonus time to say “it 
isn’t enough”. I don’t think I’ve ever met a banker who thinks he is 
overpaid.’

The trader replied: ‘I have written my witness statement and 
sworn an oath and you keep asserting I am lying.

‘I don’t think anyone can sit and say being paid $800,000 is being underpaid, but it just was not what was agreed.’
