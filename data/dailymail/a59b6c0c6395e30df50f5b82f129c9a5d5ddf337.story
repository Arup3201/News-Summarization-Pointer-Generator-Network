Paddy Kenny has left Leeds United by 'mutual consent', according to the club.

The goalkeeper departs having made 80 appearances in all competitions over the past two seasons.

Leeds announced the news via their official Twitter feed, saying: 'We can confirm that Paddy Kenny has left the club by mutual consent. The keeper made over 70 appearances for the club #lufc.' 

Moving on: Paddy Kenny has left Leeds United by 'mutual consent'

Beaten: The goalkeeper had been first choice at the club for two seasons

New man: Marco Silvestri has replaced Paddy Kenny between the sticks this season

Kenny signed for the Championship side from Queens Park Rangers in 2012, and has also played for Sheffield United and Bury in a professional career so far spanning 16 years.

He was first choice stopper for the club during the past two campaigns, but lost his place in the starting lineup following the arrival of 23-year-old Italian goalkeeper Marco Silvestri over the summer.

And he is yet to even make the bench so far this season, with another arrival Stuart Taylor preferred as backup.
