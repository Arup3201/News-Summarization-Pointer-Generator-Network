A brother and sister who bravely gave chase to a man attempting to kidnap their 22-month-old baby brother have spoken about the moments leading up to young Owen Wright being snatched.

Brenden, 10, Delicia, 8, and Owen were approached by the stranger as they played in a park in the tiny town of Sprague, Washington, after their babysitter had left them unattended on Sunday.

The man, described as about 30 years old, 6-foot to 6-foot-2, with a thin build, brown hair and a mustache, first attempted to befriend the two older children.

Delicia Wright, 8, said that the man told them he was nice to kids and had been babysitting for a long time, she didn't believe him and her screams helped raise the alarm

Big brother Breden said he wasn’t scared by the man and jumped into action because they he wanted his brother back so they could go to their cousin's birthday party

‘He said he was nice to kids and he had been babysitting for a long time,’ Delicia told Good Morning America. 

Surveillance video shows the man, who police are still tracking and hoping to ID, running down the sidewalk with the toddler in his arms. In hot pursuit are Owen’s brother and sister.

‘I thought he was trying to kidnap him so I ran and screamed,’ said Delicia.

Big brother Breden said he wasn’t scared by the man and jumped into action because they had an important family function to attend.

‘I was chasing him so I could get my brother back for my cousin’s birthday party,’ he explained.

The dramatic scene ended after a pair of local teenagers also chased after the man and he set the boy down and ran off on Sunday, authorities said. 

Michael Wright, the father of the three children, said he was relieved that young Owen was unhurt and very proud of his other kids' bravery. ‘For my kids to run after him that is an act of courage,’ he said

‘For my kids to run after him that is an act of courage,’ he said.

Wright had left his three children with a babysitter on Sunday while he went to work. They were playing unsupervised in a city park near the sitter's house.

'I can't explain the feeling, the anxiety and everything that goes into finding out your children is missing or something has happened to them,' Wright told KXLY-TV.

Sheriff's deputies said the man talked with the children for a few minutes, then scooped the toddler out of his stroller and ran down the street. 

Surveillance video from a grocery store showed the kidnapper running, child in arms, with Delicia chasing and Brenden not far behind.

Delicia's screams alerted Dorothy Giddings, who was working at her antique store downtown, reports.

Owen's older sister Delicia, left, and brother Brenden, right, were also captured on security video footage as they gave chase after the man who had taken their younger brother Owen

'I said there is something wrong,' she recalled on Tuesday.

'Then this man busts out and runs across the street and he's got a baby and a little girl right behind him screaming,' Giddings said.

'The girl said, 'That man got my baby brother! That man got my baby brother!''

Giddings said she realized what was happening and sent her teenage grandson and his friend to chase the man.

As the older boys approached, the kidnapper put the child down in a vacant lot and fled. No vehicle was seen with the suspect.

Authorities said they don't believe the kidnapper is a resident of Sprague, a wheat farming town of about 500 people located 40 miles west of Spokane. 

'We'd recognize him if he was local.' said Lincoln County Sheriff Wade Magers. 'We are leaning on somebody coming through town.'

Authorities have no leads in the case.
