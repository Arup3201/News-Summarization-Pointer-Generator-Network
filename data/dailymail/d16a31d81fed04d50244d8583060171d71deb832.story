Krishna Venkatesh, a Microsoft employee, has been missing for a week

A 27-year-old Seattle man has vanished since he left his job at Microsoft a week ago.

Krishna Venkatesh's car was found at Deception Pass on Monday, its owner mysteriously missing. 

Cops found the vehicle at the state park while tracking GPS data from his cell phone. 

Dog teams on Tuesday searched the trails around Deception Pass and found his car locked—nothing unusual inside, the Whidbey News-Times reported.  

A Microsoft employee on went to check in on Venkatesh on Friday after he failed to show up for work as a program manager twice in a row.

Co-workers at the tech giant filed a missing person's report on Monday.

Friend and co-worker Shimul Sachdeva says she last saw Venkatesh on Tuesday at a trivia night with co-workers.

'Knowing Krishna, this is uncharacteristic,' she told the Seattle Times.

'It was raining, it was dangerous, why would he drive up there?'

Sachdeva says Venkatesh's cell phone is either off or not charged — but she knows he usually carries at least two charger with him.

Venkatesh has no known chemical addictions or mental-health issues, the Seattle Times reported.

'The fact that he has been gone for several days may mean that he is in danger,' police spokesman Drew Fowle told the newspaper.

He is described as an Indian America male with black hair and brown eyes.

Venkatesh, about 5-foot-8 to 5-foot-10 and 160 pounds, drives a gray Toyota Corolla.  

The Deception Pass Bridge is the site of several suicides each year, according to the Whidbey News-Times.

Those who jump are usually not found because of the waterway's current, the newspaper reported.

Anyone with information should contact the Seattle Police Department at (202) 625-5011.
