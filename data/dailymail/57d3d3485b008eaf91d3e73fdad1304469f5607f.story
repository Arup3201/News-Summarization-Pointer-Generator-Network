The world's most expensive property has gone on sale - but to live in it will cost you a staggering £13,500 per square foot.

The luxury Hong Kong home, located in the city's exclusive Victoria Peak district, has been placed on the market for £63 million.

While the total price may not seem much compared to some of the world's most sought-after residences, the house has a saleable area of just 4,600 feet. 

This is around one quarter of the size of Britain's most expensive flat - which recently sold for £140 million in London's Hyde Park.

Property includes a 4,480 square foot garden, an 800 square foot accessible rooftop and separate 275 square foot terrace, 900 square feet of car parking space and a private pool

The penthouse has a saleable area of just 4,600 feet - making it the planet's priciest property by area

Listed by developers Sun Hung Kai Properties, the house is ranked as No.1 in the Twelve Peaks development at 12 Mount Kellet Road in Hong Kong.

The company released a price list for all 12 houses in the lavish complex last night, with  the penthouse being by far the most expensive.

It includes a 4,480 square foot garden, an 800 square foot accessible rooftop and separate 275 square foot terrace, 900 square feet of space to park a car and a private pool.

The house is located on Victoria Peak, a mountain on Hong Kong Island hugely popular with tourists because of its spectacular views.

Whether the penthouse will be able to command the full asking price remains in doubt.

Sale of two of the other properties in the development, No.11 and No.12, had to be cancelled after all of the bids fell short of asking prices, the South China Morning Post reported. 

Both smaller than the penthouse, No.11 was listed at £8,300 per square foot, while No.12 is being offered at £8,700 per square foot.

The penthouse is part of the exclusive Twelve Peaks development - which have all been put on the open market by Sun Hung Kai Properties

The most expensive home sold  in Hong Kong to date was 5,989 square-foot and also located on the Peak. 

It was bought for £61 million in 2011 - working out as £10,250 per square foot.
