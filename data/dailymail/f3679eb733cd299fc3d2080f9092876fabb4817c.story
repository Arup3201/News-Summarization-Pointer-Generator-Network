Celtic's Glasgow derby with Partick Thistle has been called off due to a waterlogged pitch at Firhill.

Champions and league leaders Celtic had been due to play the New Year's Day derby at 5.30pm but the game has been postponed after a 1pm pitch inspection.

Due to the match being postponed, Celtic may be overtaken at the top of the table.

Second-place Aberdeen can leapfrog the leaders and reach the summit of the Scottish Premiership if they beat St Johnstone at Pittodrie in a 3pm kick-off on Thursday.

Thistle, on the other hand, sit ninth in the table and have missed out on the opportunity to move up a place above Dundee.

A statement on Partick's website read: 'Unfortunately, following a pitch inspection, and despite the best efforts of the ground staff, today's game against Celtic has been postponed due to a waterlogged pitch.'Â 

The derby will be rescheduled for a later date in the season, with Thistle asking fans to keep their tickets for the match that will be played 'as soon as possible'.
