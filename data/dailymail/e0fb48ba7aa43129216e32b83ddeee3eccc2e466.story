A French family of seven - including four children - has been kidnapped by Al Qaeda in Cameroon today.

The family is believed to have been taken from northern Cameroon to Nigeria, where another group of foreign nationals were taken yesterday.

The seven foreigners, including one Briton, were abducted by a little-known extremist group on Monday, a French official said.

The abductions follow a French military mission in Mali to remove Islamic jihadists who had taken control of the north of the country.

Details of the kidnapping were not immediately clear, however, President Francois Hollande, speaking during a visit to Greece, noted that terrorists 'are not just in Mali.'

Hollande warned French citizens in the region to avoid putting themselves in dangerous situations.

A total of 15 French citizens are currently being held in western Africa - one other in Nigeria and seven thought to be in northern Mali.

Boko Haram - which means 'Western education is sacrilege' - has launched a guerrilla campaign of bombings and shootings across Nigeriaâ€™s predominantly Muslim north.

Stern words: Francois Hollande warned that there is a threat against French nationals following the French military mission in Mali

It is blamed for at least 792 killings last year alone, according to an AP count. It is known to have ties to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, an Algerian-based group that opened a front in Mali.

'If everything is confirmed, this signifies that the fight against terrorist groups is a necessity,' Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said in Paris.

'There is a battle to be led by the international community against terrorist groups and narco-terrorists,' a reference to the trafficking in drugs, cigarettes and other commodities that has flourished in northern Mali under the extremists.

The latest kidnappings have added to fears of instability and danger toward Westerners.

Before Tuesday, there were eight French citizens being held in the region, including one who was taken in Nigeria.

An analysis published Monday by Stratfor, a U.S.-based private global intelligence firm, warned that there likely will be more attacks by Ansaru targeting Westerners and Western interests in Nigeria, as well as neighboring nations.
