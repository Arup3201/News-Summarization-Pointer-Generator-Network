As if French women didn't have enough to crow about. Not only are they supposedly better dressed than British women, they look seven years younger by the time they reach 40, according to a study.

Annoyingly, it's something we can't deny because the survey was carried out among British women.

Participants were asked to look at photos of French women and guess their age. Politician Segolene Royal, 59, was thought to be 12 years younger, and Hollywood legend Catherine Deneuve, 69, was thought to be ten years younger. Actress Juliette Binoche, 49, was judged to be 41

The politicians: The UK's Harriet Harman, 62, and French socialist, Ségolène Royal, 59

Who looks best? French actress, Catherine Deneuve, 69, or the UK's Helen Mirren, 67

However, the women were pretty sure 
they knew their secret. Some 89 per cent said their youthful appearance 
was down to their skincare regimes.Indeed, French ladies start using 
creams and serums at least five years earlier than British women.

More than a third of French women 
start as early as 15, and by the age of 20, nearly two- thirds of them 
are using specialist anti-ageing creams.

British women generally don't start 
using skincare until the age of 25, and even then only half of British 
women that would have a consistent anti-ageing regime.

And the French spend more on 
anti-ageing products than anyone else in Europe, forking out £1.9billion
on facial skincare in 2009. British women spent less than half that, or
£854million.

Escentual.com skincare expert Emma 
Leslie said: 'British women tend to start using anti-ageing products 
when they start to see the first effects of ageing, which can be a bit 
too little too late.

'French women, on the other hand, will often take preventative measures even when they are in their mid to late teens.

'French pharmacy skincare brands also lead the world in the latest anti-ageing research.'

The French are by far the biggest spender on anti-ageing products in Europe and spent £1.9 billion on facial skincare in 2009 - an average expenditure of £78 for every woman over 15 in France.

British women spend less than half that (£854 million) which may go some way to explain the comparatively wrinkle-free French visage.

When British women were asked if French women's increased expenditure had worked for them 90 per cent said they thought it had, while 51 per cent said they would be happy to spend more if it got the same results.
