When Michael Tomlin married his girlfriend of nine years, he decided it was a good opportunity to celebrate the other love of his life – Vimto. 

The 31-year-old and bride Liz, 27, were toasted with the soft drink rather than champagne and guests were asked to wear purple to match it.

Mr Tomlin and his ushers wore purple ties and cufflinks, and the priest at St Gregory’s Church in Bollington, Cheshire, donned a purple sash. Tables at the reception were dressed with vases and candle holders in the same colour, as well as Vimto sweets.

Michael and Liz Tomlin are so obsessed with Vimto that they decided to tie the knot with a themed ceremony dedicated to the soft drink

The groom from Oldham, who developed his obsession as a child, said: ‘When I met Liz I even took her to a Vimto statue … for our first date and I proposed to her at the same spot … it was only fitting it played a major part in our day … I just love the stuff.’

His best man even incorporated the couple’s favourite drink into his speech by jokingly exclaiming: 'this speech is sponsored by Vimto.'

On their honeymoon to Lanzarote, Michael was so concerned that they might not have any of his favourite tipple on sale in the Canary Islands, he put some cartons in his luggage to take over with him.

Mr Tomlin who became obsessed with the soft drink after his grandmother made it for him when he was a little boy said: ‘I’ve always loved Vimto since I was a lad. My gran always make me Vimto and it is a special memory for me.

'When I met Liz I even took her to a Vimto statue in Manchester city centre four our first date and I proposed to her at the same spot four years later.

'The fact is we wanted a Vimto themed wedding because it had played such an important role in our relationship. Vimto is at the centre of our hearts, so it was only fitting that it played a major part in our day. When I first met I was telling her the history of the drink and she loves all things history.'

Mr Tomlin, from Oldham met his Polish-born wife in 2005, after she was locked out of her friend’s house and he offered to take her to his friend’s house while she waited.

Mr Tomlin, an administrator at a solicitors in Manchester city centre said of their first meeting: 'At my friend’s house it was really busy so I took her into the kitchen where the T.V was playing.

'Suddenly James Blunt came on and we started dancing. I knew in that moment that I had fallen in love with her.

We were going to meet up in Manchester city centre for our first date and I just didn’t know where to take her until I thought of the Vimto statue.

'I just wanted to go there and get away from all the madness of the city and watch the trains go by and look at the statue. It is such a nice and special place.'

He said: 'Liz is from Poland so she had never had it before. As you tend to need water with Vimto, they don’t sell it a lot of countries. As soon as she tasted it she loved it. It is now her ‘go-to’ drink too.'
