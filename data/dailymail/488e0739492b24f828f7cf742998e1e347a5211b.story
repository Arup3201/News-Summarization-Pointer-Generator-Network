A pregnant doctor who saved her husband's life by diagnosing a deadly blood poisoning condition died just hours later when she contracted the same illness.

Craig Stobo said he would have died if his wife Fiona had not suspected he had contracted sepsis after he fell ill. The cause of the illness has still not been established but the hospital is investigating.

But as he lay recovering in hospital, just 24 hours later, he was told how how his wife was battling with the same deadly condition which would go on to claim her life and that of their unborn child.

Craig Stobo has said he could have died if his wife Fiona had not suspected he had contracted sepsis after he fell ill

Mr Stobo is now trying to get on with his life, with the couple's son Robert, three, but he doesn't want his wife's death to be in vain

Mr Stobo, 43, who lives in Edinburgh, said: 'There is no doubt that Fiona saved my life - and I do feel very lucky that she did - although it’s not a life that I would have chosen to come back to. A life without her.

'It was just such a tragedy that she couldn’t save her own too.’

Mr Stobo had woken up one morning in August 2012 feeling unwell.

He said: ‘I was feeling dreadful. I’d woken up that morning feeling fine, but by lunchtime I was shivering violently and I felt sick.

Mr Stobo was told his wife Fiona was battling with the same deadly condition as he lay recovering in hospital

‘Fiona was 35 weeks pregnant with our second child and I had been going with her for a scan at the hospital that afternoon, but instead I went home to bed.

‘A few hours later she rang back. She said she was worried about me, and she wanted me to go and see the GP. By this time I was much worse. I couldn’t eat or drink anything and I felt like I was burning up.

‘She came back home and drove me to the GP. I had to lean on her for support when I got out of the car, I was barely registering what was happening as I had a raging temperature.'

Mrs Stobo and the GP thought he was suffering from sepsis - a blood infection - so she drove him to Edinburgh Western Hospital.

Mr Stobo said: ‘She stayed with me in the evening, but she started shivering. I was worried about her, but she assured me she was just cold and tired. She left before it got too late.

'She was staying with her mum and dad, so she set off to drive home to their house.

‘By the next morning my legs were swollen and I was diagnosed with sepsis - just as Fiona had suspected.

‘I was so grateful to her. Without her quick thinking I wouldn’t still be here. It would have been too late if I had left it any later to get to hospital.’

But later that day, a nurse broke the news to Mr Stobo that Fiona herself was desperately ill in hospital with an infection.

He said: ‘I couldn’t take it in.  I was lying in a hospital bed with an infection - and now Fiona was too. But I’d only seen her the night before when she’d sat by my side in this hospital.’

Mrs Stobo had taken a turn for the worse driving home from the hospital. She’d taken painkillers for a headache when she’d arrived at her parents, but within hours they had taken her to hospital.

Doctors hadn’t been able to save her unborn baby and Mrs Stobo had to be put on a ventilator. Mr Stobo was put into a wheelchair and taken to the hosital.

He said: ‘Our daughter Isla was stillborn at 5am and as I held her in my arms it was the most ghastly moment of my life. Just a few days ago we were both on top of the world, looking forward to our new arrival. Now I was holding my lifeless daughter in my arms, with Fiona fighting for her life.’

Mrs Stobo had haemorrhaged after the stillbirth and the infection - the same sepsis infection that had nearly claimed her husband’s life - was now raging through her body. 

Sepsis occurs when the body responds to infection, and can be caused by a huge variety of bacteria – such as C.diff, E.coli, streptococcus or MRSA.

Chemicals released into the blood to combat the  infection trigger widespread inflammation, which leads to blood clots and leaky vessels.

Symptoms include a very high or low temperature, fast breathing, racing heartbeat, confusion or slurred speech. The skin may also be cool, pale or mottled, and in advanced stages the patient  can lose consciousness.

About 100,000 people are admitted to hospital with sepsis each year. Patients with the condition occupy more than 30 per cent of intensive care unit beds.

Mr Stobo said: ‘There were so many doctors and nurses around her, battling to save her life. She was wheeled down to the operating theatre for an operation to try and stop her bleeding, but they couldn’t save her. She had a cardiac arrest on the operating table.

‘I was waiting outside, desperately waiting for news of the operation. When the door opened and I saw the surgeon’s face, I knew then that I had lost her.

‘The next few days were just a blur. I couldn’t believe that I had to go on with my life without Fiona. She was the most amazing person I had ever known.’

Mr Stobo is now trying to get on with his life, with the couple’s three-year-old son Robert, but he doesn’t want his wife’s death to be in vain.

He said: ‘The doctors are still investigating our cases as officially they aren’t related. But I’m putting my energies into raising funds to raise more awareness of this condition. 37,000 people die of it each year.

‘Friends and family have stepped in to help with fundraising walks, coffee mornings and triathalons and we have managed to raise £25,000 so far. We are funding a seminar about sepsis and hope to fund more research too.

‘Just a cut, bite or scratch can lead to sepsis developing and I would hate to think of any other family going through what I have been through. It’s my duty to Fiona to try and do something about it, and that’s what I will do.’
