A deadly albino cobra that has been on the run in California since Monday after attacking a pet dog has finally been captured.

Animal control officers found the snake hiding in a lumber pile in the backyard of a house, and snared it using a long grabber before packing it into a box.

The animal, which is believed to have escaped from captivity, will now be taken to an animal shelter. 

Officials have caught the deadly albino monocled cobra that has been on the loose in California this week

Residents in the Ventura county neighbourhood had been told to be on the lookout after the venomous reptile escaped from captivity on Monday

Specially trained officers found the snake hiding in a woodpile in someone's backyard yesterday afternoon

'We are overjoyed. We are glad that the public was not harmed,' Los Angeles County spokesman Brandon Dowling said after county animal control officers found the monocled cobra at 3pm. 

While specially trained officers managed to avoid being injured, the snake did try to attack. 

'Once we grabbed it, it was afraid of us so it tried to strike at us,' animal control officer Fred Agoopi said. 'But we had the proper equipment and were able to handle it.' 

Cobra venom is a neurotoxin that can kill within an hour by paralysing the lungs. 

However, it wasn't immediately clear whether the albino snake — which apparently escaped from captivity — still had its venom glands, authorities said.

The snake, which is several feet long, had been on the loose since at least Monday evening, when it reportedly bit a dog. 

However, the veterinarian who treated the animal said it appeared that the dog wasn't bitten but was hurt while trying to escape the snake, KNBC-TV reported.

Using a long grabber the officers managed to get the snake into a box despite its attempts to bite them

The snake drew media attention earlier this week after it attacked a dog, though vets now think the canine may have injured itself trying to escape

Monocled cobras grow up to 4ft long and kill their prey using venom which paralyses the lungs. The monocled species are named for a ring on the back of their hood

Animal control officers said they found the snake by checking bushes and woodpiles during cooler mornings and evenings when the snake was more likely to be active.

There were no more confirmed sightings of the snake until Thursday afternoon, when it was seen slithering in the same  area of Ventura county where it originally was spotted.

Tanya Gray saw it crossing the road. She kept an eye on it but didn't approach. 'It wasn't my job to stop it or catch it,' she told KCAL-TV.

'It was just shocking because I didn't think I'd be the one to find it,' a youngster, Simona Lucchina, told KABC-TV. 'We were just driving by and my dad was showing me 'this is where they lost the snake' and all of the sudden we just saw it. It was a big coincidence.'

Before the snake was captured, authorities had warned residents to keep an eye on their children, to keep pets indoors and to call 911 if they spotted it.

The snake has now been taken to an animal shelter. Cobras are illegal to keep as pets, and so far nobody has come forward to claim it

A Twitter account set up pretending to be the snake tweeted this message after the animal was caught

But, residents of the neighbourhood, which is surrounded by snake-friendly brush and wilderness areas, weren't panicked by the intruder.

'I think we're all a bit concerned, but growing up in an area where there are rattlesnakes, it's probably not quite as scary,' said Susan McGrath, who lives near to where the dog was bitten. 

The monocled cobra is native to Southeast Asia, parts of India and China, and it can grow to 4 feet or more. Its name derives from a circle or ring on the back of its hood.

Cobras are illegal to own in California except for educational and scientific purposes.

The cobra apparently escaped from captivity, although authorities had not found the owner. Dowling said Thursday that investigators are following "a few leads" on where the snake came from.
