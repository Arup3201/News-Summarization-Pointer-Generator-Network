Rory McIlroy has worn the air of a man intent on peaking at the right time this week. He has played well, racking up five birdies in succession at one point during his second round at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, the first time he has accomplished that on the PGA Tour, but there has still been a sense of a man playing within himself.

Everything is about the build-up to Augusta where the US Masters begins in a little over a fortnight’s time. It is there that McIlroy will attempt to join a select group of the greats of the game by winning the only major that has eluded him.

Victory would lift him into the company of Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods who all won the Masters, the US Open, The Open and the US PGA at least once in their careers.

The Masters is the one major that McIlory is yet to get his hands on having won the other three

Despite his uneven form in the last month, McIlroy, 25, has looked and sounded like a man who is exactly where he wants to be in the run-up to the tournament where victory eluded him three years ago when he collapsed on the back nine of his final round. 

If he gets into the same position this year, it is safe to bet he will not let it slip. It was important to him to play here at Bay Hill, partly to honour Palmer, who has seemed hurt in recent years when McIlroy decided to skip the tournament.

But McIlroy also wanted to replicate his routine from 2011 when he had a fortnight off before the Masters. ‘It worked pretty well at Augusta, at least for 63 holes,’ he said.
