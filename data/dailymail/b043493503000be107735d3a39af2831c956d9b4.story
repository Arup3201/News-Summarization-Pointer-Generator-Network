A pensioner has been left blind in one eye after an infection caused by her contact lens 'ate away' her cornea.

Despite desperate attempts to save June Scott's eye, doctors were forced to remove it in a three-and-a-half hour procedure.

The 62-year-old spent three weeks in hospital and was attached to an intravenous drip after the disposable lens began burning her eyeball.

But despite three operations and a string of eight-hour sessions to flush the infection from her body, surgeons were forced to cut away her cornea.

June Scott had her left eye removed after developing a fungal infection from wearing contact lenses 

Medics in Spain - where she lives during the winter months - have said a fungal infection known as Fusarium had attacked her left eye.

Mrs Scott, who lives with her husband of 20 years, William, 62, said: 'I went to the doctors and they said they have never seen anything like it.

'It was just like something was eating at my eye, I could not bear to look at the light. I am heartbroken.

'At first I thought there was a hair in my eye but the next day I had to go to the emergency hospital.

'I was given drops but it just got worse.'

Mrs Scott bought a set of contact lenses from a UK company before travelling to her Spanish holiday home in Alicante in October last year.

But after it began affecting her eye, she was rushed to a specialist unit at the nearby Hospital Clinico San Juan.

Surgeons battled for nearly a month to save her vision and she underwent three operations in an effort to clear the infection.

But just before New Year's Eve last year medics were forced to remove the eye in a three-and-a-half hour procedure and June, who lives in Chester-le-Street, County Durham, has been left with no sight in her left eye.

'I was on antibiotics for three weeks and had to go to hospital every day from 9am to 5pm. It was absolutely horrendous and the pain was so awful I had to go in the middle of the night. 

'We have to come back to England so that I can get a false eye but it is never going to be the same.

'My life has changed. I can't drive anymore and the pain I had to go through was horrendous. I was in a foreign hospital in agony but the foreign doctors were fabulous.

'I am due back to England in April and I am going to need further treatment.' Mrs Scott is now considering taking legal action against the contact lens supplier as she tried to get her life back on track.

She said: 'I first used the contact lens in March last year and I had to go back to the opticians. I noticed a brown stain and after I took them back several more came, but they were the same.'
