Manchester United have been heavily criticised by former Liverpool star Jan Molby, as the playmaker adds fuel to fire ahead of the crucial clash in the race for the Champions League places.

The ex-Danish international is very much a favourite at his former employers and was keen to play up Liverpool's chances of pipping United to fourth.

Molby gave a scathing review on Louis van Gaal's side and has described their position in the Champions League places as a 'miracle.' 

Jan Molby labelled Manchester United as 'clueless' and thinks it's a 'miracle' where they are in the table

He told the Daily Star: 'I've seen a lot of United's matches this season and I find it quite amazing they are in the top four. The best way of describing them is clueless.

'I look at United and see weaknesses. If we move the ball at pace and put them under pressure from the start then we will cause them a lot of problems.

'Considering the talent they have available, they just haven't performed.

Louis van Gaal and Wayne Rooney won't be pleased with Molby's comments ahead of the clash 

'But having an excellent keeper and not conceding many goals has enabled them to paper over the cracks and win games narrowly.

'The fact they are fourth is a minor miracle. Their performances just haven't merited a top-four place.

'They aren't in the best four teams in the Premier League and Liverpool are in much better shape.'

Liverpool are the in-form team in the Premier League with the Champions League places in their sights
