If you're stuck for a Christmas present, perhaps you could give Winston, Constantine or their friends a home.

But these cute and cuddly toys aren't just stocking fillers – they are vintage Steiff bears, and even the smallest, Julie, will set you back £3,000.

All five are part of a collection of 32 bears, which is to be auctioned next month and expected to fetch £100,000. 

They belong to collector Jena Pang – who named them – and include some of the world's most significant examples.

The oldest bear in his collection is a 'rod' bear from 1904. These are the first teddy bears made and can sell for over £4,500. 

The most valuable, however, is Constantine, made in 1905 and worth £15,000 all on his own. 

Mr Pang has spent the last 12 years amassing an enormous collection of rare toy bears dating back to the early 1900s worth hundreds of thousands of pounds.

The eccentric collector has become so attached to his bears that he takes them wherever he goes, including to the theatre and top restaurants.

These five bears are from a collection of 32, which will be auctioned next month and tipped to fetch £100,000

'When I started work in 2002 my office was opposite a teddy bear shop and after walking past it every day I finally caved and bought my first bear for about £100,' said the Oxford University graduate.

'I instantly fell in love with bears and I started collecting more and more, as a hobby and as an investment.

'Originally I collected modern bears but then I realised that the vintage bears were where the value was.

'Most of my bears come from the early 1900s with the earliest dating back to 1904.

'They are more than just collector's items - they come with me most places I go, whether it be to dinner, the theatre or away on travel.

'I am selling them because I am planning on moving to Hong Kong and the bears simply wouldn't survive the humidity.

'As a collector it it my responsibility to ensure the survival of these bears so they can be enjoyed by future generations and unfortunately that means selling them.

'I will be very sad to see them go but it is better than risking losing them altogether.'

The bears will be auctioned at Special Auction Services in Newbury, Berkshire on December 4. 

Daniel Agnew, auctioneer, said: 'This collection is simply the finest single-owner collection of vintage bears to come up for sale in many years.

'The thing that makes it so special is the sheer number of bears that are in mint condition. The majority of them are over 100 years old yet they look like they were made yesterday.

'You might see one or two vintage bears in this condition at an auction but to have 32 in one sale is unheard of.

'Needless to say collectors around the world are very excited about this sale.'
