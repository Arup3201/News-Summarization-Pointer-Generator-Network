A dinner of roadkill, a full Christmas spread salvaged from dustbins, and a side order of sprouts that are a year old - some people will go to no limits to cut Christmas costs, it seems.

Hampshire student Libby Russell rooted around supermarket skips and rubbish dumps to find all the components of a heaving Christmas spread - from duck and roast potatoes, carrots and parsnips, to the cheese course and mulled wine and beer.

If you think that's extreme, try Jonathan McGowan, the 46-year-old from Bournemouth, Dorset, who has dined exclusively on roadkill for the past 30 years, and has a trio of fox, pheasant and venison planned for his table on Christmas day.

Even those who profess to love the much-maligned Brussels sprout might find they balk at Roz Morrison's way of serving them - last year's dish of sprouts, apparently perfectly preserved in their dish.

And for a different type of 'foraged food' - and those who can't face the faff of cooking at Christmas - a takeaway service is offering a range of festive dinners, including a mince pie pizza, 'Christmas' sushi and a kebab served with lashings of bread sauce.

Art student Libby Russell has been living as a 'freegan' for a year - someone who gets all their food and household items from dustbins.

Miss Russell said: 'Last Christmas, I wasn't "bin-diving" and I must have paid over Â£100 on presents and other 
things.

'This year, I've only spent Â£20 altogether because I've been able
 to get so much from bins.

'I
 don't spend a penny on food either. My whole Christmas dinner has come 
from a skip. Even the microwave we use was discovered in a bin.'

Reject roast: Mini quiches, pork pies, fruit salad and cheese were just some of the things that went into Miss Russell's freegan meal - along with beer that was literally bin-end

Waste: Brits throw away 249, 650 tonnes over the Christmas season

Miss Russell has already served up a freegan feast for her housemates Sam Coggins, 25, and Louiza Hamidi, 23.

Along
 with her duck dinner plus trimmings, she was able to give offer them 
mince pies, mini quiches, trifle, pork pies and fruit salad.

The
 house was decorated with a rubbish bin Christmas tree, lights and 
baubles - all of them sourced from high street and charity shop skips, 
as were her Christmas presents, which she wrapped in dustbin wrapping 
paper.

Every year, British people throw out 249,650 tonnes of waste over Christmas.

Miss Russell said, 'I go binning for the obvious 
reason of not paying for stuff but mostly, I just hate seeing food and 
other things wasted.

'The waste during the holidays is terrible. It's senseless throwing Christmas cards and food away before the day even arrives.'

Jonathan McGowan shares Miss Russell's horror at Christmas waste, and it's what he says led him to his penchant for roadkill.

The taxidermist and wildlife consultant says that packing his car boot full of squashed animals he finds on country lanes has saved him thousands of pounds, and that his Christmas dinner will cost around 50p a portion.

He said: 'The meat is rarely dry and there's no wastage - I eat what I can.'

He described fox as tasting 'a bit 
porky', the un-hung venison as 'fresh' and the pheasant as 'very fresh 
too, which tastes a bit like turkey anyway.

His unusual meat dish will be served along with vegetables including mushrooms he picked himself.

Mr McGowan's freezer is jam packed with a variety of critters yet to be skinned and filleted.

He said: 'I think more people should eat roadkill - obviously it's not something that's sustainable for everyone to do and I know most people might not want to do it.

'But I would seriously encourage more people to pick up dead animals off the road rather than see them wasted, or at least throw them off the road so other animals or people can pick them up.'

And if all that meat is a little too much, never fear - there's a leftover veg option too, courtesy of Roz Morrison from Torrance near Glasgow.

Preserved: Roz Morrison offers up a dish of last-year's sprouts

Ms Torrance found a dish of last year's Brussels sprouts as she prepared for Christmas and discovered they were perfectly preserved - though only after some struggle to pen the lid, which had been sealed shut by the gases emitted by the vegetables inside. 

It turned out that her father had washed up on Christmas Day and assumed he had already cleaned the dish, so put it back in the cupboard - complete with its contents.

Jeweller Ms Torrance said she and her father thought they still looked good enough to eat - but didn't test them just to be on the safe side.

But if the thought of sourcing your own food from the side of the road, a bin or the back of a cupboard is just too much, one takeaway service is offering festive versions of classic fast food to order on 25 December.

Special delivery: Pizza, a kebab, sushi and curry make up the four festive offerings from Just Eat this year (roaring fire not included)

Just Eat's Christmas range includes pork and stuffing sushi, mince pie pizza and turkey stuffing kebab with bread sauce.

The 10-inch mince pie pizza is made from 350g mince meat, edible gold stars and icing sugar.

The kebab contains 500g of turkey thigh mince, chestnut stuffing, cranberry relish in a pitta bread with bacon, lettuce and bread sauce creates the festive kebab.

Chipolatas and bacon are used to make the sushi, which is wrapped in cavolo nero, while 100g of brussels sprouts are used in the spicy curry.

The dishes were designed based on 
responses to a poll on the Facebook page of the food ordering service, 
which asked members of the public to name their fantasy festive 
takeaway.

New research shows more than 8,500 takeaway orders were made on Christmas Day last year, with over 500,000 orders made between December 23 and 31.

Almost half of orders were for pizza, a third were for Indian and 8 per cent were for fried chicken and chips.

Four in 10 Brits plan to order a takeaway during the holiday period this year, the study from Just Eat found.
