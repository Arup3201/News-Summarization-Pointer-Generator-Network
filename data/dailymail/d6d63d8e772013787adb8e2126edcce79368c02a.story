Are Liverpool right to stand by Luis Suarez?

Liverpool scored another massive PR own goal last night after allowing Luis Suarez to contest the FA’s claim that a three-game ban for biting is not harsh enough.

Suarez accepted an FA charge of violent  conduct for his outrageous attack on Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic at Anfield on Sunday.

But the Uruguayan and his employers have risked yet another backlash after making it clear to the governing body that they will appeal should an independent disciplinary commission hand down a more severe punishment than the standard three-match suspension.

A three-man panel will convene on Wednesday morning to consider the evidence submitted by both the FA and Liverpool.

Jaws of despair: Luis Suarez's latest controversy has landed him in further hot water with the FA

They could decide that three games is 
sufficient punishment but a far more likely outcome is that Suarez will 
face a ban which will keep him out of action for the start of next 
season.

An FA statement read: ‘Luis  Suarez 
has today (Tuesday) accepted a charge of violent  conduct, following an 
incident with Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic in Sunday’s fixture at 
Anfield.

‘However, Suarez has denied the FA’s 
claim that the standard punishment of three matches is clearly 
insufficient for this offence.

‘The incident was not seen by the match officials and has therefore been retrospectively reviewed.’

Or disgusted? Perhaps the taste of Ivanovic's arm is still in the forward's mouth

The tribunal will take into consideration past behaviour and previous cases before reaching a 
conclusion on Suarez, who was banned for seven games after he bit PSV 
Eindhoven’s Otman Bakkal in November 2010.

Tottenham’s Jermain Defoe escaped a 
long ban and fine in October 2006 as he was booked after biting Javier 
Mascherano, then of West Ham. Had Suarez been booked last Sunday, the FA
 would have still had the power to take him to task as the rules have 
changed since then.

Having accepted the FA’s charge, 
Suarez will start his ban this weekend. He will miss the trip to 
Newcastle on Saturday, the Merseyside derby at Anfield on May 5 and 
Liverpool’s visit to Fulham on May 12.

Or concern? Perhaps Suarez is worrying about how much first-team football he's likely to miss

Speaking out: Prime Minister David Cameron said the FA need to take a hard line

Disbelief: The Chelsea defender didn't seem to know how to react after he was bitten by Suarez yesterday

But, by promising to defend their 
player against a possible longer ban, Liverpool can expect more 
condemnation as they have already been rebuked for failing to administer
 their own suspension. The matter has been taken so seriously that the 
Prime Minister entered the debate on Monday.

Suarez was fined an undisclosed amount
 — thought to be two weeks’ wages, a figure that equates to more than 
£200,000 — on Monday morning. He insisted that the money be donated to 
the Hillsborough Families Support Group.

The 26-year-old was warned by managing
 director Ian Ayre that he was on his last chance at Anfield. The 
Uruguay striker was found guilty by the FA in December 2011 of using 
racially abusive language to Patrice Evra.

Liverpool have stressed that  Suarez, 
who has been strongly linked with Bayern Munich, will not be sold this 
summer and have vowed to work with him to improve his behaviour.

Liverpool forward Luis Suarez is back in the spotlight after appearing to bite Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic on the arm during the 2-2 draw with Chelsea at Anfield, going on to score a late equaliser.

Here are some of the previous controversies surrounding the Uruguayan forward.

February 2007: Suarez made his international debut for Uruguay against Colombia but was sent off in the final minutes after being shown a second yellow card for dissent.

November 2007: Joined Ajax from Uruguayan side Nacional but he was later suspended by the Dutch giants after a half-time dressing-room altercation with team-mate Albert Luque.

July 2010: During the 2010 World Cup quarter-finals, Suarez prevented Ghana's Dominic Adiyiah from scoring in the final minute with a deliberate handball on the line and was subsequently sent off. A penalty was awarded but missed by Asamoah Gyan and footage showed Suarez celebrating on the sidelines. Uruguay eventually went through to the last four on penalties.

November 2010: Suarez was handed a seven-match ban by the Dutch FA and fined by his club for biting PSV Eindhoven midfielder Otman Bakkal during an Eredivisie match.

October 2011: Following his move to Liverpool in January 2011, he was involved in a tackle with Everton's Jack Rodwell and goes down with apparent minimal contact. Rodwell was then sent off.

October 2011: Suarez was alleged to have racially abused Manchester United's Patrice Evra during a Premier League match. Suarez was later found guilty by an independent regulatory commission and banned for eight matches and fined £40,000.

December 2011: Was seen making an offensive gesture towards Fulham fans. At this time he had already been charged by the Football Association over the racism incident, although not yet punished, but was handed a further one-match ban for the gesture.

February 2012: United and Liverpool met again at Old Trafford, but more controversy blew up as Suarez refused to shake Evra's hand before kick-off.

October 2012: Celebrated a goal against Everton by diving in front of Toffees boss David Moyes who had earlier claimed that 'divers' such as Suarez were putting fans off the English game.

January 2013: Handles the ball prior to scoring Liverpool's winner in the FA Cup third round tie at Mansfield.

April 2013: Appears to bite Branislav Ivanovic on the arm but escapes punishment on the pitch as the referee fails to see it, and scores Liverpool's equaliser seven minutes into stoppage time as they draw 2-2 with Chelsea at Anfield.
