Disgraced: Civilian worker Craig Rothwell stole more than £100,000 while working at a police station

A disgraced office manager at a police station stole more than £100,000 from his own force by secretly pocketing registration fees.

Craig Rothwell, a civilian worker at Greater Manchester Police, got away with his crimes for four years and was even promoted during that time.

But his career with the force is over after he appeared in court and admitted theft. He will be sentenced later this month.

Rothwell, 27, joined as a clerk and later became a supervisor at Greater Manchester Police's International Visitors Registration Unit, based at Bootle Street station in Manchester.

Under visa regulations, some foreign visitors, including overseas students, migrant workers and academics, must notify police and pay £34 for a registration certificate.

Tens of thousands of applicants paid the fee during Rothwell's tenure but, instead of banking the money for the force, he kept it for himself.

It is unclear how the offences came to light. It is understood that Rothwell tried to hide the fraud by saying he had banked money without specifying how much.

Rothwell, of Havenwood Road, Wigan, pleaded guilty at Manchester Crown Court to five charges of theft from Greater Manchester Police Authority.

The court heard that the final figures have yet to be agreed, but the prosecution believe the total is more than £100,000.

It is understood that he stole almost £40,000 in the tax year beginning April 2009 alone.

The police worker was supported in court by his mother and father.

Judge Michael Henshell adjourned the case for pre-sentence reports to be prepared.

Offenders can expect to be jailed for up to four years in cases of theft involving a breach of trust and sums of more than £100,000.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said Rothwell had resigned from the force prior to disciplinary proceedings.
